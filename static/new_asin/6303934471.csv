732042,5,6303934471,"Orson Welles' eccentric, ornery film adaptation of THE TRIAL is a work charged with protean ironies and stark insights, and the fifty years that separated the making of the film from the writing of the novel can account for much of this.  Not especially sympathetic to the author's more esoteric spiritual concerns, and put off by what he saw as Kafka's apparent pre-Auschwitz navet&eacute;, Welles simplified the book, distilling it as a forceful Expressionist allegory on the theme of personal responsibility in the face of arbitrary, amoral persecution.  In the film, the inspectors who arrest Josef K. (Anthony Perkins) are waggish heavies out of hardboiled pulp detective fiction.  These characters speak in the salty Americanized vernacular of J. Edgar Hoover's G-men with self-satirizing tough-guy talk like ""don't you worry 'bout that, mister!"" and ""you wouldn't want to be one of them troublemakers, now would you?""  Even the examining magistrate deadpans like a sly caricature of Joe Friday and suggests that any further action pertaining to K.'s complaints should be conducted ""down at the station.""  Adapting Kafka to the idiom of 1950s B-movies and sensational television drama, K.'s initial arrest is presented in the hip, edgy, anarchic style of Hollywood gangster films, and staged in much the same manner as the third-degree interrogation of the Mexican shoe-store clerk, Manolo Sanchez, in TOUCH OF EVIL.  Indeed, K.'s protests of ""invasion of privacy"" and ""rank abuse of civil rights"" suggest the paranoid atmosphere of McCarthyism and the underhanded investigative methods of the House Un-American Activities Committee.
Welles had originally intended to compose his film in the classic manner of German Expressionism, designing elaborate sets and orchestrating lighting and mise-en-sc&egrave;ne in the controlled environment of a studio.  But this was not feasible since adequate funding was unavailable, and Welles was forced to shoot the exteriors ad hoc in the utilitarian style of the Italian Neorealist filmmakers.  Some Kafka purists were disappointed that Welles shot the scenes of K.'s arrest among the new Tito-era Socialist architecture of Zagreb rather than around the older buildings dating back to the antebellum years of the waning Habsburg r&eacute;gime.  And there is one extraordinary shot early on in the film, apparently done in a single extended take, which features a crippled woman dragging a trunk across a barren field which recalls Polanski's TWO MEN AND A WARDROBE as well as the absurdist chamber-drama of Samuel Beckett.
Welles' treatment of the Initial Interrogation opens with K. sitting in a spacious, two-tiered hall that bears an uncanny resemblance to the old Berlin Reichstag.  Here, K.'s ""trial"" seems to reflect the historical origins of National Socialism.  Later, we see masses of shabbily attired, sad-faced old men - ""the accused"" - standing around dumbly in the vast, cavernous antechambers of the Law, in perpetual anticipation of the judges.  At one point, they even appear as a forest of half-naked bodies with numbered placards around their necks like a Gustave Dor&eacute; illustration of Dante's Inferno, depicting the condemned souls at the tribunal of Minos or the resurrected in the Valley of Jehosephat on the Day of Judgment.  But it is later still - deep within the bowels of the law court offices, receding into infinity like the bewildering geometric arabesques of an M. C. Escher drawing or Spinoza's mathematically structured universe - that Josef K. first gets a taste of what lies in store for all accused men.  And it seems hardly a coincidence that this haunting scene was filmed at Gare d'Orsay, a now-defunct railway station in Paris where thousands of European Jews were deported to Nazi death camps little more than twenty years earlier.
In the restored version of THE TRIAL, the sequence of events accords more faithfully with that of the book and K.'s meeting with the priest takes place shortly after his dismissal of the Advocate.  Welles turns the Advocate's lair into an arcane mausoleum, which all at once evokes Solomon's temple, Prospero's island, Faust's study, Borges' Library of Babel, and Charles Foster Kane's Xanadu.  One gets the impression that the books gathering dust on the shelves were written by Jehovah Himself - inscribed by lightening flashes and to be read accordingly in the hallowed sanctuary of the Law.  The Advocate takes over the pedagogical function of the priest in Kafka's novel but he is a decidedly less sympathetic figure, and the director's broad characterization has more than just a few shades of Hank Quinlan, the corrupt, evidence-planting border-town sheriff in TOUCH OF EVIL.  The parable, ""Before the Law,"" is demonstrated this time through the use of ""visual aids"" like a parody of Rod Serling's gnomic didacticism in THE TWILIGHT ZONE or the corny, leaden deus-ex-machina device of the windbag psychiatrist who conveniently ""explains"" everything at the end of PSYCHO.  K.'s silhouette takes the place of the man from the country, thus completing the meaning of the opening prologue and giving the film a certain thematic continuity and symmetry - even an element of Brechtian ""alienation"" and self-reflexive mimesis, as well as a Godardian circularity of logic.
Welles' presentation of the final execution takes a decidedly different tone than Kafka's original.  For example, the (somewhat overemphatic) appropriation of Albinoni's apocryphal ""Adagio in G Minor"" gives Josef K.'s death march a certain majesty and melancholy grandeur, and this deliberate use of early baroque music as a kind of tragic requiem leitmotiv is rather reminiscent of the films of Pasolini.  Like his character in LA RICOTTA, Welles criticizes the ""average man"" for his hypocrisy and spiritual poverty - a sentiment not far removed from the Marxist-Catholic-homosexual Pasolini's own radical contention that ""a member of the bourgeoisie, whatever he does, is always wrong.""",972086400,18,5984,5.3446808510638295
732043,5,6303934471,"This is a book-to-film adaptation that should please both the Kafka and the Welles camps.  This is because Welles faithfully follows much of  Kafka's story and dialogs while also achieving an astounding artistic  impression on the screen that only enhances the power of the story.
The  only major deviation from the book is that the film totally omits the key  discussion of the ""Guard"" story between Joseph K and the priest  near the end of the book (but such a lengthy discussion would probably make  the film too talky and too long); to compensate for it, Welles presents the  said story as a series of still drawings when the film begins.  The film's  ending also differs slightly from the book but it retains the  power.
Regarding the film's visual presentation, it is vintage Welles.  It is one thing to read about the seedy and decrepit locales in the book,  but it is quite an experience to actually see them.  Welles successfully  presents a world unlike any we've seen in a film: buildings grandiose on  the exterior but dark and dingy inside; bizarre lighting, ominous shadows,  meandering corridors, ... all add up to an unforgetable impression that  lingers in your mind.
The only thing I can carp about is Anthony Perkin's  performance.  He is way too squeamish and nervous.  I expected a more  dignified disposition from a character that is supposed to embody an  ""everyman"" quality.

This  DVD changes all that and finally presents the film to a home viewing  audience how it should be presented.
The funding for this picture came  from French pockets, and so it is the only film he made aside from Citizen  Kane in which he enjoyed total creative control, without studio  interference. Welles himself said that this was the greatest picture that  he'd ever made, and I think I might even be inclined to agree with him.

From the opening montage-fable, Welles instantly  teleports us to the perfect darkest level of the paranoia labyrinth that  the next two hours will provide. It is no co-incidence that for the  starring role in a neglected genius' film, Orson decided on the actor who  would suffer from similar Hollywood afflictions. Perkins was easily one of  the best this century. Typecasting savagely murdered his career. The Trial  is nearly as mesmerising as the Kafka novel.

732159,5,6303934471,"THE TRIAL is not for everyone.

Director Orson Welles at times employs minimalism but just as often he captures vast crowds, both indoors and out. Most confusing to those not familiar with Kafka's book are its metaphors and symbolism. Example: On his way to a court building, the accused Josef K. (Perkins) walks through a plaza crowded with elderly people who are in various states of undress and wear numbered placards around their necks. Looming above them is a statue with arms extended that's hidden by a white sheet. Some barely perceptible movement might be a cinematic error or could mean that beneath its spotless shroud is a human being. (I still haven't figured that one out!)

Here an otherwise anonymous office worker named Josef K. is arrested by police for an unspecified crime. His efforts against a baffling legal system go nowhere and ultimately get him escorted to an open field. Josef has no idea what's in store.

I have purchased four copies of this, one of my favorite movies. I would like to address this expensive version of it.

I will not belabor the brilliance of this movie. I love Orson Welles, and this is my favorite of his movies. The cinematography, the adaptation of the Kafka novel, the stifling claustrophobic air of the movie, all perfect. The movie speaks to a fear, a unnameable fear that descended on the world during the cold war. The background score is something that belongs to a haunted elevator car; creepy. The movie takes on an air of a horror movie in its fashion, although the subject matter isn't terrifying in a monsters and zombie kind of way. I would, in terms of the tone of the movie, compare it towards ""Eraserhead"" or perhaps ""Taxi Driver"", although the movie is far less violent than either one of those movies. When I'm watching ""The Trial"", it gives me the same feeling as those two movie: disquieted, foreboding, choking, putrid, squalid, lonely. A world dying with its inhabitants confused and unable to deal with the causes or the consequences. As with many Orson Welles movies the logic of the movie is that of a surreal nightmare punctuated by occasional startling images off-center and menacing. Are the events the product of a defective mind? A rambling subconscious floating through transoms of slumber?

With that, the main reason I wrote this review, was that I paid a great sum of money for a DVD that is supposed to be the best release of this movie on DVD.

Well, it is.

That's not saying that much, but its a big improvement.

Sound: 3/5
Video: 4/5
Extras and Presentation: 2/5

Everything is pretty good, the aspect ratio is supposed to be 1.66:1, but it seems slightly off. The sound is pretty good, a little low, clean though. The video presentation is not HD, but its decent for a DVD of this type. I have the Image Video ""Twilight Zone"" TV series, several other Image video movies, and the video seems 10% poorer than any of these. The video clearly has some very small lines and graininess which is very apparent in scenes with light colored subject matter, or if you pause the DVD. The DVD, like other Image Entertainment DVDs, lacks subtitles, which I dislike. It plays nicely on shuffle in my DVD Changer, which is a plus.

Somehow, despite all the awful copies of this movies, with a company that has ""remastered"" as many movies as Image Entertainment has, the presentation could be a whole lot better. The price I paid was $70 for a new copy and, honestly, for what I got, I'm not entirely happy. A Criterion Collection DVD of this Movie would have cost half as much, and been much better. Is this DVD worth $70? Absolutely not. Is it worth $40? If you love the movie as much as I do, I would say yes. If money is no object, its a reasonable price. I think $20 for this DVD would be the right price for the average person.

One word of accolade which actually helped shove this hefty pricetag down my gullet: I have had DVDs from every major company I have ever bought any number of movies from mysteriously ""go bad"" and stop working. I even had a Criterion Collection DVD go bad (Disk 2, Brazil)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brazil-The-Criterion-Collection-3-Disc-Boxed-Set/dp/B000G8NXZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brazil - The Criterion Collection (3-Disc Boxed Set)</a>&nbsp;I have never had a single Image Entertainment DVD go bad.

I like this DVD, enough to bump it up to four stars. It probably only deserves three stars. I can see and hear the darned movie, and as far as I'm concerned, that makes it worth something. I've even heard a few lines of dialogue that I couldn't hear on other versions of the DVD.

Hey, Criterion Collection: Plenty of room in the pool still...I'll buy a fifth copy of the movie, so how 'bout it? You in?",1301616000,10,4736,5.251322751322752

The Milestone DVD looks and sounds excellent -- I think they actually used the original negative discovered in a storage unit in Manhattan? -- you can really appreciate the eerie beauty of this film's high-contrast, black-and-white visuals, the weird sets and locations, and great performances (esp. by Anthony Perkins, Orson Welles, and Akim Tamiroff).

I also love Franz Kafka's novel and have always been a bit disappointed that Welles changed the ending (slightly) -- based on interviews with Peter Bogdanovich, Welles couldn't really come to grips with Kafka's totally despairing conclusion.  But don't worry, it's still a lot more satisfying than the completely tacked-on ""happy ending"" that was forced on Welles for his 1942 adaptation of The Magnificent Ambersons.  In a way, Welles's final scene for his version of The Trial is just as offbeat and ambiguous as anything in Kafka's stories.",1267056000,2,1144,5.224043715846994
732168,5,6303934471,"""The logic of this story is that of a dream... a nightmare."" So Orson warns us in the opening prologue, and viewers would do well to heed that: this is certainly a surreal, abstract film filled to the gills with bizarre imagery and symbolism that may take multiple viewings to unravel.

The story is that of Joseph K., who awakens one morning to find himself under arrest. What are the charges? Never said, of course: that'll come out at the trial.

Most of this movie is dialogue, and if you're bored by talk-fests, you'd best skip this movie as it requires you to (gasp!) pay attention and actually use your brain. But aside from witty banter, the film is a visual feast for the eyes. The cinematography comes close to stealing the show in this: Orson outdoes himself with odd lighting and sets that play the black-and-white medium to the hilt.

I've never read the Kafka novel this is based on, so I don't know how many liberties Orson took with the story. Divorced from that preconception and bias, the movie certainly stands on its own, and has quickly become one of my favorites.

This dvd is bare bones: no special features to speak of. However, if you just want a copy of the movie itself, you can't beat the price.",1259107200,2,1223,4.520361990950226
732245,4,6303934471,"As a coherent narrative, 'The Trial' is more flop than success.  It is a disorienting film, and while I tried mentally to glue the different scenes together into some kind of gestalt, I never quite succeeded.  This may have been Welles' idea all along, in order to emphasize the nightmarish world on-screen, but even if that's so, I prefer my dystopian worlds at a bit more of a remove.

Still, Welles adaptation of Franz Kafka's work isn't a loss, as those same individual scenes that refused to add up were often quite interesting in themselves, whether from the absurdity of the characters actions or the juxtaposition of the people against architectural interiors and exteriors that were as expressive as the dialogue.  From the very beginning, when a stranger enters Joseph K.'s claustrophobic boarding room and starts demanding justification for K.'s every move, to the bizarre scene of Welles as the advocate and his client Bloch, 'The Trial' is a disconcerting collection of imagery and conversation that threatens to break out and become lucid at any moment - until it tails off again into nonsense and nonsensical landscapes.

Welles also comes across a somewhat heavy-handed in expounding on his themes.  In this vision, the director points us toward The Law, a hopelessly tangled legal system that is inescapable once K. has become embroiled in it.  Fair enough, but from what I remember of Kafka's novel, it seemed as though K.'s troubles were a direct result of his existence - of being human.  From the film they seemed to arise not from his intrinsic humanity, but because Welles' dream caricature of the 1960's industrial and political climate put him in a situation he could not reasonably hope to exist in.  With Kafka, K. was guilty because he existed - in Welles version, the Establishment is on trial.  That may be a subtle difference, but that's why Kafka is universally interesting, and the film 'The Trial' has a dated feel to it.

Anthony Perkins' acting has always been difficult for me to watch, and as K., he didn't change my mind.  Despite this, I still feel that 'The Trial' had enough going for it to justify watching again.  Unfortunately, the copy I saw was not good, with both video and audio problems, so I'll be investing in the Milestone Collection version, as other reviewers have noted that's the one to watch.

I know some will protest that the film is about a nightmare, and a nightmare has no logic, no sequencing. Fine. But the film must hold together, there must be an order to a film, whatever it's about; a film must ""read"" easily, like a good book. This film is like a badly written legal brief. A convolution of many parts, impossible to untangle.

There are some good scenes in it: K's office, the outdoor nightmare scenes, some others. They are like fine pearls on an otherwise bad string of pearls.

I know some will argue that this is a great film, and that great films require concentration, and the problem is that I just don't understand it. Wrong. This is the worst type of film imaginable because it tries to be so great and fails so completely. It's one thing to make a bad monster movie. It's quite another to attempt a powerful statement about a human condition and then nothing but incoherence flickers by on the screen.

Many of us who admire Orson Welles desire almost desperately that his later films be good, just so that somehow it won't be true that his entire career tailed off so steadily, inexorably, and tragically. It isn't so.

His talent had gone by the time this film was made. Woefully so, horribly so. In fact, all the interest in Welle's post-Kane films is due to either a morbid curiosity about him - how spectacularly his success soured; or because we're trying to convince ourselves that he was still viable as a filmmaker - that he didn't alienate himself and squander his ability.

Even if you're not an artist or a film enthusiast, this film is downright trying. The worst scenes are the opening one, the one in the advocates ""office"", and the ending with the dynamite. It isn't the quality of the sound, or the picture cropping, or the transfer that makes this movie bad. It's just a bad movie. Just terrible.

Orson Welles life serves as a very great warning to all of us, eh? Know what is really there, not what you wish could be there. Otherwise you may disappear up your own backside, as he did.",1227657600,3,2262,4.515892420537897

As a film I couldn't sit through it at once, I had to get up and return a couple times because the convoluted situation makes it hard to follow. This aspect is surely purposeful, Welles is a master of storytelling and images, and the production itself proves amazing.
I would highly recommend this for it's adaptation of Kafka's posthumous story, beautiful and horrible direction, cinematography, set and art direction and music.",1220227200,,764,5.12

Orson Welles plays the advocate, but he is still playing Randolph Hearst as in 'Citizen Kane.  In fact, one of the characters was called Kane.'  Josef was arrested at his own apartment and had to stand trial before his totalitarian neighbors.  He was never told his 'crime.'

Doors play a big part in this strange movie in an abandoned Paris railway station.  The outside facade is beautiful, like ours in America, but it being French makes it especially so.  The empty part of inside is dark and scary.  Josef doesn't know why he has been singled out for prosecution.  His cousin tries to get him to marry her.  Lenny is a sad character.

This is totally Orson Welles' movie, as producer, director, and advocate for the victim.  His prescence was everywhere.  He was a big man.",1219708800,,1034,4.661111111111111
732250,5,6303934471,"I rented this fascinating film via mail order from Blockbuster Total Access a few weeks ago and enjoyed it so much that now I want to buy it. Which version should I buy?

I've come across at least *four* different versions here on Amazon.com; however, the features on the version I rented don't seem to match any of these versions. Two of the versions seem to point to the same list of customer reviews (6305772061 (The Milestone Collection) and B00004YKQD, both from 2000). The other versions don't currently have any customer reviews (B000C6NP9U (from 2006) and B000E28P9C (from 2000)).

The version I rented had decent picture quality (but I had to change the aspect ratio on my widescreen TV to 4:3 to make the characters appear normal width), decent sound quality (no audio sync issues), an interesting featurette on Orson Welles' films (focusing on The Trial), a featurette on the work involved with restoring the film (I believe it had a copyright from the early-1990s), a trailer, and an audio commentary track by film reviewer Jeffrey Lyons. Could this be yet another version, perhaps from The Orson Welles' Collection (B000C6NP0E, also from 2006)?

For the rental, Blockbuster's web site shows the image from Amazon.com part number B00004YKQD, but the features on the disc don't seem to match Amazon.com's description. Since it was a mail-order rental, the snap case wasn't provided--so I can't determine the item that way, either. The disc was one-sided and had an image from the film that resembled B000C6NP9U.

Which version should I buy? Customer reviews seem to favor The Milestone Collection version (6305772061), but the description for the item doesn't mention what features it comes with (if any). B000C6NP9U was released two years ago--six years after The Milestone Collection version--and uses the most accurate-looking depiction of the actual movie, yet there are no customer reviews for this version.

732251,4,6303934471,"No doubt Welles enthusiasts will be compelled to purchase the Milestone edition of perhaps Kafka's greatest work adapted for the screen, but for the casual fan of Welles and those interested in Tony Perkins' early film work before he was so unfortunately typecast after Hitch's ""Psycho,"" this film is a highly successful realization of the nighmarish world only Kafka could envision. About a man who is arrested, tried and eventually executed without even knowing his crime, Perkins is memorable as Josef K, the timid and confused clerk whose protestations against his accusers fall upon deaf ears (the scene in the giant courtroom with hundreds of extras packed in is most memorable).

With Welles in the rather minor role as the Advocate and featuring familiar castmates Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider, Elsa Martinelli, and old favorite Akim Tamiroff (""Touch of Evil""), viewing this unsettling and disturbing vision is not only unique and moody, but an exercise in camera technique whereas Welles throws everything but the kitchen sink at the viewer to make Josef K's nightmare the audience's own through the use of elaborately staged sets--for example, Josef K's office with a sea of desks with his fellow worker drones and their typewriters clacking away, the Belle Epoque railway station in Paris, and other baroque yet abandoned buildings in what is today's Czech Republic.

Welles' totalitarian state is painstakingly visualized with each scene as the film moves forward to its eventual conclusion and K's execution. With pinscreen animations narrated by Welles himself the parable of ""The Law"" becomes all too familiar and real to the situation faced by K in the remainder of the film. At the time this film was made, only a genius like Welles could pull this off and make the film believable and, at the same time, a work of cinematic art.

While this DVD transfer is, by no means remarkable, it is for avid Welles fans and newcomers to his work, another opportunity to discover the gifts this director/actor gave to the art of film.",1189036800,,2041,5.050445103857567

The photography takes Welles's deep focus black and white cinematography to new levels, way beyond anything in Citizen Kane.  Kane is a great film, but I really like this film more.  It's much darker, incredibly ambiguous, and the feel of it is superb.  It's like a nightmare that you can't get out of.  I really like the scenes where Joseph K works.  There are almost a 100 desks at this factory like structure, and he is absolutely no one.  The labyrnith that K gets caught in is one of his own making in many ways.  This film is almost Felliniesque in a way, except it's much darker than the maestro's work.  It's the most surreal of Welles's work, and it gets more and more fascinating as time progresses.

732253,4,6303934471,"The Trial (Orson Welles, 1963)

The going wisdom for the last forty or so years seems to be that Anthony Perkins' star shone brightest as Norman Bates in Hitchcock's Psycho. I say give Perkins any decent director and he'd have acted his little heart out; in fact, as Joseph K., the main character in Orson Welles' adaptation of Kafka's The Trial, he turned in, I believe, a superior performance to that he'd given for Hitch three years earlier.

Welles, as was his won't when dealing with classic literature, ran somewhat roughshod over Kafka's source material, but what he came up with was as fine as anything else Welles ever did. It's The Trial in the post-McCarthy world, a weird blend of jazz hipster-ism, Cold War hysteria, and Kafka's own fine-tuned paranoid fantasy. In adapting the novel to his own ends, Welles does erase some of the novel's ambiguity (there's never a time in the original novel when one is entirely certain of Joseph K.'s innocence), but he replaces it with a firmer hand in depicting the change in Joseph K.'s character, the fact that K. only truly becomes a criminal, and a threat to society, once the system has tagged him as a criminal. Perkins portrays this change with the sort of shaky solidity that made him such a perfect casting decision in Psycho; here, he starts off the same nervous-nellie type we experience when we first see him in the office at Bates Motel, but by the end of the movie, he's become much more self-assured, if still confused as to what it is, exactly, they believe he's done. (By that time, of course, he's done a great deal, and so the point becomes rather moot.)

Wonderful, as with most Wellesiana. ****",1173052800,4,1666,4.679180887372014

The back of the packaging claims that ""This special letterboxed edition of The Trial was transferred from a pristine original 35mm negative, making the film available for the first time in its original widescreen format."" Not true. First, the film is presented with large black bars on the top and bottom to make it into 1:66 to 1. Because of this and the poor transfer quality (although better than any of the public domain issues) and this, it looks like this was actually transferred from a VHS & not 35mm.

732346,5,6303934471,"""The Trial"" is not your formulaic Hollywood blockbuster. It's more like a Samuel Beckett or Bertolt Brecht play. Every scene evokes the absurd, paranoiac, existentialist condition in a faceless totalitarian/bureaucratic society.

Yes, Anthony Perkins does play Kafka's Joseph K a la Norman Bates. Whether he should have opted for another persona is debatable. I suppose had Perkins never starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0783225849/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho (Collector's Edition)</a>,the character would be more accessible for some. Personally, I had no trouble with his neurotic characterisation. Unnerving though he seemed at times, his vulnerability, his innocence as the Every-man comes across rather convincingly.

Fuelling the paranoia is Orson Welles inventive camerawork, subtle use of light and shadow and word play.  Stairwells spiral like an Escher sketch; ceilings are low and claustrophobic to project entrapment; rooms and streets are dark and dilapidated to infer societal decay; huge doors and cacophonous rooms symbolise the overwhelming odds Joseph K faces to ascertain his crime; and Freudian slips and perfunctory conversations lend to his sense of angst.

Ironically, this nightmarish world only gets progressively worse the more Joseph K discovers how the Established Order operates. The deeper he probes, the deeper he buries himself, literally. In the end Joseph K symbolises the lone individual crushed under the wheels of societal conformity. He is the anti-thesis to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizen-Kane-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00003CX9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

As for the digital transfer, the Image version (which was taken from the LaserDisc issue) is frankly not the best out there, but it is adequate and viewable. The minor pops, occasional ghosting of images and slightly un-synced dialogue in a few scenes are not all that disturbing.

This fantasy surrounded the predicament of Josef K. played adroitly by a post-""Psycho"" Anthony Perkins.  Perkins is awakened early one morning by two policemen who proclaim that he's been arrested.  They fail however to establish exactly what the charges are.

What follows is a figurative paranoic journey by Perkins through the jumble and incongruities of the workings of the legal system including interactions with various characters along the way.  Welles himself plays the advocate Hastler, Perkins' lawyer, who gives him a lesson in the complex machinations of the legal system.  Of particular amusement was Akim Tamiroff who stars in the film as Bloch, a long suffering and exploited client of Welles, who had set up residence in Welles' house in order to gain favor with him.

The film which was shot in various European locations and featuring a largely European cast had a bizarre ""Through the Looking Glass"" feel to it.  Perkins, while trying to seek out justice was confronted with only chaos.",1145404800,,1126,5.081521739130435

Kafka's story builds an atmosphere of mystery and confusion, a sense that there are huge forces at work, and a feeling that Josef K is simply irrelevant to his own life. Welles takes that feeling frames it in stark, surreal black and white. The first scene shows a claustrophobic apartment, with ceiling barely above head-height. Later, there's Josef's agoraphobic workplace, apparently an aircraft hangar tiled with desks to create some hellish typing pool. After that, other scenes show endless racks of files, bottomless heaps of bundled paper, and jagged landscapes of light and shadow - lots of shadows. It was like Dante's Inferno recast in a 1950s office environment, with petty bureaucrats as the demons.

I haven't read The Trial in years, not since I was a project manager. Honestly, I learned more about project management from that book than from any other source. This movie brings back that sinking feeling all over again, but safely encased in the glass of a video screen.

732351,5,6303934471,"The Trial is Orson Welles' adaptation of the Franz Kafka novel of the same name.  It follows the story of Josef K., a man who finds himself in a nightmarish version of reality he neither understands, nor can escape from.  It begins with Josef K. (played by Anthony Perkins) being awakened by police officers, who refuse to tell him the crime he's accused of.  He's placed under arrest, but not taken into custody - they allow him to continue his ""normal"" life.  Instead, he is taken away at bizarre moments to appear in court, which is a distorted mockery of the concept of justice.  There is no judge, no jury, no stated charges, no burden of proof, no lawyers, and no one that assumes impartiality or responsibility.  When Josef K. asks for a lawyer, he's told it's not necessary, since it's an ""informal"" questioning.  After the ""court"" appearance, Josef K. goes to enlist ""the Advocate"" to defend him.  The Advocate (played by Orson Welles) is portrayed as a demi-god of legal access and information not available to the common man - to be worshiped and feared at all costs, since without him, they are nothing.  However, in the end, Josef K. is sentenced and eventually executed for these elusive crimes.
The Trial is a merging of the existential philosophies of Kafka with the cinematic genius of Welles.  Josef K. is not a particularly empathetic character - he's weak, morally flexible, and passively pushed along this nightmare. In either ending, (the book or the film), Josef K. doesn't fight against his fate, or meekly accepts it. It embodies the existentialist view that Josef K.'s nightmare prison is one of his own making, and therefore only he is responsible for its injustices.  Welles adds his own perspective in the sense that it reflected the subversive tactics of those in power around the judicial system during that time - a very Marxist perspective in the face of the McCarthy era, where the HUAC had frightening similarities to the nightmare court.
Overall, it's a film with many possible interpretations and meanings - that are neither right nor wrong, but dependent on the audience's own observations.  Like most of Welles' and Kafka's work - you can either take it at face value, or as an intellectual piece - either way, it's a well done cinematic accomplishment.",1083110400,4,2292,4.833759590792839

This film is not even a denunciation. It is the real trial of bureaucracy, any bureaucracy in the world. A bureaucracy works on a norm and everyone in that bureaucracy has to abide by the norm and get homogenized to standards that are not even clearly stated. Hence one has to melt in the crowd, become part of the squalid and bleak brickwall, never to be noticed as original in any way. If the reverse happens then the bureaucracy defends itself, though it knows it is not a crime to be original. In fact it even knows it might be an asset, even for this very bureaucracy. But it cannot accept it because it would lead to total unraveling and hence dissolution of its very existence. So when you are accused by a bureaucracy, you never know the real crime. They choose anything that can be seen as reprehensible from any point of view, particularly the moralistic one. And they try you on those accusations, though the real crime is the fact that you have not kept the line. What's more, in this field of  justice  to win is to lose. The heads of this bureaucracy can decide whatever they want, no matter what the various committees or commissions or whatever have decided or advised. If then you try to challenge this one-man-made decision you end up in administrative courts  that are even worse because they can take the time they want and they can decide what they want, so that you end up in a never-ending set of appeals whose outcome is in no way clear or predictable.

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen Welles' The Stranger (1946) or Touch of Evil (1958) beforehand (or Citizen Kane, for that matter).  Those movies make a lot more narrative sense and represent a less difficult introduction to The World of Welles. Perkins' embodiment of the constantly beleaguered K. is more restrained than I would've thought, however, which helps to ground the film in some--very loose--semblance of normality. Welles (Albert Hastler, i.e. ""The Advocate"") actually gives the more bizarre performance, since he whispers the entire time. He also speaks the end credits (in a non-whisper) instead of letting the words scroll down the screen (as he also did in The Magnificent Ambersons).  The film features a number of other odd touches like that.

But it gives everything a hokey feel when the ambience (or lack of it) of actors' voices doesn't match the setting they're in. It's not as bad as many dubbed foreign films but it's noticeable and annoying nonetheless. I wonder if some of the weaker moments of Perkins' dialogue didn't come from bad dubbing.  And, though not having read the book, I doubt that Kafka ended his story the way Welles ends this film.

Anyway, it's a visual masterpiece.  I'll watch it again, maybe with the sound turned off.",1508025600,,1344,4.88546255506608

7855739,5,6303934471,"THE TRIAL: The Trial is a terrifying, dark, twisted Kafkesque nightmare of a film, boosted by Orson Welles's stunning, dark visuals, and of course, a staggering, brilliant performance from Anthony Perkins. Perkins, in one of cinemas greatest, most befuddled performances, is absolutely electrifying as Josef K., a man who is arrested but never told why, caught up in a labyrinth of deceit, lies, and vaguery. Haunting and scary, The Trial a two-hour nightmare that is absolutely unforgettable.

Straight from the psyche of Orson Welles, this excellent film is not to be missed.

7855740,5,6303934471,When I finally got around to watching Orson Welles' The Trial I was astonished that I not heard of it before. All these years of film discussion and no one had brought it up. It wonderfully captures Kafka's nightmare which was ripe for adaptation being so full absurdist imagery. If you're a fan of the Kafka story or dystopian films in the line of Brazil don't miss Orson Welles' The Trial.,1375488000,,391,4.52112676056338

7855742,5,6303934471,"This may be my favorite Orson Welles picture; it's hard to say, the man was a genius. Most surely best known for Citizen Kane, I think this particular picture will keep the viewer more glued to the screen. This movie takes a few viewings to fully appreciate; it's not the kind of movie you watch once and then lend out to a friend, not caring if it ever returns. This film demands repeated attention, becomes like a religion with each viewing, and never gets tiresome. Following the dialogue is confusing enough, it leaves you feeling uneasy, disturbed, feeling guilty (which is what Kafka was all about, and Welles captured amazingly on screen). This isn't blockbuster material, it's more or less avant garde, artsy; it's well thought out cinema is what it is. I recommend reading reviews on the movie, and on Orson Welles before purchasing it, to see if it's up your alley. I was so fascinated with it, I bought Kafka's book. Usually this ruins a film for me, being that a director can't possibly cover half the things an author can on paper. In this case I loved both the book and the incredible job Welles did. Plus Anthony Perkins was perfect in his nervous, fidgety role.",1371600000,,1177,4.636363636363637
