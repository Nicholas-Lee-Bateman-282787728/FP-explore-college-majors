8236371,4,B000ZU8LYC,"This is a 1-hour TV program by ESPN classic about The Fight between Ali and Frazier I.  The DVD of the program is available from boxing DVD websites, such as boxingjunkies.com.  Commentators include Joe Frazier, his son, Burt Lancaster, George Foreman, etc.  While Frazier tried to help Ali in having his boxing license back, Ali criticized and disliked Frazier, calling him ""Uncle Tom.  Frazier did not understand Ali, and called Ali as ""Cassius Clay"" instead of ""Muhammad Ali.""  One reason why Ali agitated Frazier was for public attention for fight money (Ali and Frazier received $2.5 million each), but the true reason was unclear. Jim Brown, the former football player, commented that ""His (Frazier's) innocence represents white America.""  For Ali, political indifference against Vietnam War by Frazier may be unforgiven.",1373673600,,827,5.323076923076923
8236372,5,B000ZU8LYC,"I saw most of this documentary on ESPN back in 2000. It was a fascinating look at the Ali-Frazier championship fight in Madison Square Garden in 1971. What I remember best is not the fight coverage - although that was an interesting story too - but the discussion about what Ali and Frazier came to symbolize in a polarized American public. Also, it was interesting to see what a high profile event it was, given how interest in boxing has waned in recent years.

I wish this film were available for purchase. I keep checking.",1293494400,3,526,4.536842105263158
