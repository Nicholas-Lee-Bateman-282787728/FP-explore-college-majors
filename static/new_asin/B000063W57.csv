It was filmed on my college campus and several of the actors were from the college - even the dean made a brief appearance.  Definitely gives us the giggles.",1189123200,,261,4.531914893617022
7959950,3,B000063W57,"One doesn't normally associate Florida with vampirism, yet director Robert Favorite's 1972 film The Brides Wore Blood, an interesting but unfulfilling little vampire flick, comes to us directly from the Sunshine State, a state whose very name does not bode well for vampires and their kind.  This film doesn't do much for vampires either.  There was potential here, and I believe the film has something of a minor cult following, but there are far too many things left dangling in the end to suit my tastes - and there is not enough blood to help make up for any of these shortcomings.
Our story revolves around the ancient curse on the house of Delorca.  Apparently, every son of somebody or other eventually turns into a vampire and must pass the curse on to his own son.  The current pre-vampire's uncle sets out to break the curse once and for all, calling upon the help of a psychic.  The master plan is to invite four girls to the mansion and do something with them - the details of the plan never really surface, especially since things get out of hand for the uncle pretty quickly.  All I know is that the plan originally involved injecting something with a great big needle in at least one of the girls - this particular scene is one of the longest and most realistic needle insertion scenes I've ever seen.  But I digress.  How do you get four attractive young ladies to visit your creepy mansion?  That's easy - just have your weird, hunchbacked, mute servant accost them on the street and thrust invitations into their hands.  As I said, things go awry, a few vampire-like things take place, there are a few scenes of satisfying blood loss, the questionable motives of a couple of characters are never even examined, and the film eventually ends.
The opening scene is the most problematic of all, as it introduces us to a talent-deprived pair of lovers who discover a journal and begin reading the story which the movie itself expounds upon.  We're never reunited with this original couple, and what would otherwise have been a fairly effective ending just does not work based on the context of the earlier presentation.  Besides that, my favorite character obviously went home halfway through the shoot and nobody noticed, as she just disappeared off the cinematic map.  Vampire fans also won't get many bangs for their bucks, as the whole vampirism issue seems incidental to the story.  And those fangs - never in my life have I seen more ridiculous-looking vampire fangs than what I saw here.  You couldn't get juice from a peeled orange with these tiny little things.  I won't call this a bad movie, though.  It's nothing more than a horror film that doesn't really live up to its potential.",1075161600,3,2707,4.701271186440678
7959951,4,B000063W57,"I have always liked this Florida made cheapie about vampires in an old mansion. The acting isn't bad and anyone who likes irony will love the end of this baby. The disc is hosted by Son of Ghoul, and that is a major plus in itself. Horror fans and fans of bad cinema should get this disc.",1021593600,6,288,4.0701754385964914
