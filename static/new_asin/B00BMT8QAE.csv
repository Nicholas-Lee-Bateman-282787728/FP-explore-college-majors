Specifically addresses puberty, periods, making friends, dating, sex, health, fashion, safety, careers and living on your own. Great practical advice in a visually simple format.",1527120000,,249,5.756756756756757

8570997,5,B00BMT8QAE,"This is a great video! I've scoured the internet looking for a ""sex ed"" type video for my daughters (11 and 12).
This is better than I had expected. It clearly spells out ""puberty"", changes in the female (and male) body. Discusses girl parts and boy parts, with pictures, and what they are for, pregnancy, STD's, and some birth control. It covers menstruation, the ""what"" and ""why"".
This video even covers some social issues, safety, bullying, etc.
The info in this video is delivered in a straight forward, matter of fact way. There's a little bit of silliness, but not ridiculous.
""Gay, Homosexual, Lesbian, Oral Sex, and Masturbation"" are brought up, but not discussed in depth.

I highly recommend this video for parents with daughters. It answers nearly everything, even the awkward to answer questions.
This is way better than the long, boring movies they showed us back in the 80's!",1466035200,4,889,4.887417218543046

I recently saw a newspaper reference to The Talk, the 10-minute talk with which embarrassed parents are supposed to educate their daughters about sex. Here are 80 minutes of objective information delivered by real girls about real situations. I wish someone had given me sensible advice like this when I was growing up.",1364860800,8,680,7.9605263157894735
8571000,5,B00BMT8QAE,"As a former teacher I think this video is very informative for pre-pubescent girls. Too many times, girls want to act like they know it all, but are working with little or no information, aside from having the wrong information. This video clearly illustrates and discusses menstrual and reproductive processes. It also gives girls the right to be different, and still find a way to make friends at a very vulnerable age. I would recommend showing it to girls as early as fifth grade. Wonderful tool for schools and after school programs.",1363305600,10,538,4.858695652173913
