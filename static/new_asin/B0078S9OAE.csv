8512353,5,B0078S9OAE,"I practice Hebei XingYi, and the DVD is for ShanXi XingYi, but the principles behind the movements are the same. Ken manages to show aspects of movement and form that most teachers simply do not show. It is said that instruction-by-DVD will never match instruction-by-teacher, and that is true, however this DVD may be an exception to the rule (unless one is fortunate to have a teacher who shows some of the key fundamentals in the manner that Ken does). You cannot go wrong with this DVD. Simply cannot.",1361318400,,505,4.685393258426966
