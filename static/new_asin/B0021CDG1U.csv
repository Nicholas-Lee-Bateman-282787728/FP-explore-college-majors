8348900,5,B0021CDG1U,"I haven't had a lunch box since I was in grade school!  I love the gothic vampire design and it's fun to take to work!  It's a little smaller than I hoped, and my frozen lunches don't quite fit, but it's roomy enough for lots of other things.  Good quality, and delivered on time.",1422662400,,280,4.148148148148148
