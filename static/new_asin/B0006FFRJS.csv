2182309,4,B0006FFRJS,"While I love Saiyuki to death, Geneon can be eaten by worms for all I care. And I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought so.

Beforehand, I LOVED watching Saiyuki in dub when ADV had their hands on it. (Mind you, I don't enjoy many dubs.) David Matranga was the BEST Sanzo, his voice was so fitting, as was Illich's. Lex Lang...is no Sanzo, oh no no no. All the new Enlgish voices that Geneon threw out there...the people who did casting obviously had NO lick of sense whatsoever. That accounts for the minus of one star. (Can't give it less than a three just because of poor dubbing, no matter how bad it is.) If you aim to watch this, watch it in subtitled Japanese, you're better off. As another reviewer said, they're Japanese voices rule. They're awesome.

As for the show in itself, it's great. The animation has gone up a few notches, the Urasai bits at the end of each episode rule (especially the paper sumos), and it's a pleasure to watch. Don't miss out on it, it's a perfectly fine DVD! (Just don't watch it in English. ><; )",1110067200,,1038,4.317948717948718
2182310,3,B0006FFRJS,"A lot of negativity is leveled at American voice actors dubbing anime, historically well founded, but then when you get releases like Fruits Basket, His and Her Circumstance, and Saiyuki, and in these cases (and many others) I love the English voices.

Maybe you're like me and you listen/read the subbed version first and then you listen to the English. I really enjoy seeing the humor in some of the rewrites (so long as it's not too far off the original, or dumbed down - for example Rune Soldier did some good rewrite work), and I like to work on crafts while I watch TV so being able to listen to AND be entertained by subsequent viewings in English is a major decision maker in whether I'll actually BUY a DVD series. If you like to do the same then you are going to be seriously disappointed with Saiyuki Reload.

When you have an American producer who crafts a cast of voices (both main characters as well as supporting characters) as ADV did for the original Saiyuki series, above and beyond wonderful, it's sheer bliss to listen to.

Then when the follow-up series is taken over by Geneon USA, who didn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of meeting the American audience's expectations, it's downright lousy. Stupid of them really, to set themselves up for failure that way. I feel sorry for those who are associated with the Reload project, but not as sorry as I feel for all the fans that loved the original series in English. It's not that Geneon USA can't do a good dubbed series, they can and have, but they never should have touched Saiyuki Reload.

And as long as I'm on the subject, it's not like other studios haven't done something similar but I'm hard-pressed to remember anything so blatantly wrong as Saiyuki Reload. I don't know what is more wrong with Reload, that they took a well-known and well-loved dub work or that they tried to match the main voices in a half-hearted fashion. I say half-hearted because you have choices to *try* to be similar - as with the Sanzo character - which fails miserably, and then you have complete disregard for trying anything remotely in the character's ball-park - as with The Merciful Goddess (Karen Coffer - we miss you!). Others have already mentioned actual dialogue and pronunciation, so I won't launch into that.

The first disc is very enjoyable...in Japanese. As other's have mentioned the color palette is more intense, however, I think the original is closer to Minekura's original artwork, but I don't dislike it. The lack of Cultural Background Notes are a huge loss, but the added comedic throw-aways at the end of each episode (Uru-Sai specials) are surprisingly well done. As opposed to the LSD-laced ones in Hellsing, these are not only understandable but funny. They don't make up for the notes but they're better than nothing.

I gave this disc 3 stars because Minekura's story is still there, although watered down a bit from the original manga, and because the Japanese voice talent is still as strong as ever, but the English dub drags the whole score down. If I were rating this solely on Geneon USA's work it would be in the negative territory.",1108944000,2,3130,4.692167577413479
2182311,1,B0006FFRJS,"Geneon Entertainment has taken something good and tossed it out a ten story window hoping it would fly. Lets just say that the end result was not what many were expecting. The voice actors are less than appalling, they're the worst voices that could be thrown to this series. Why ADV dropped the liscence to such a great series, is beyond comprehension. With voice actors like David Matranga, Greg Ayres, Illich Guardiola, and Braden Hunt, you had a great line up. The voices fit, not too mention the dialogue was more than comical. ADV was able to get some top notch people to dub this over and make it into something that millions loved. With Reload, you get horrible voice actors, (Lex Lang, Jimmy Benedict, Tony Oliver, Steve Cannon) Disgusting dialogue, which ""Saiyuki Freak"" pointed out, Hawkeye - Hakki, Go Joe - Gojyo, ""Stupid Monkey"" - ""Creepy Monkey"", ""Pervy Water Sprite"" - ""Louse Sprite"". (Sorry ""Saiyuki Freak"", those were the ones I picked up on, and they irritated the hell outa me.) One perk to the whole thing, the art is a bit better, Although it is weird seeing Goku in cut offs and Gojyo wearing a brown leather Jacket (Maybe it's actually suede.) I hate to say it folks, but if you are looking for a good continuation, you have found a road block. With Geneon owning the liscence for this garbage it will continue to be so. To those that watch the subbed version, go right ahead, not too many changes. Lets all just thank ADV for they did with the first series, for it was good while it lasted.

P.S. for those of you thinking that you can get used to the crappy script and horrible voice actors, give up now, you'll just end up tossing this out the window.",1108944000,3,1678,4.537953795379538
2182312,1,B0006FFRJS,"Ok,

  So I'm with everyone else on this. For those of you SUPER anime fans out there who LOOOVE watching anime only in japanese, you won't have a problem with this series, being as nothing on the subbed side has really changed.

I, on the other hand, am a serious ADV fan, because, if none of you has ever watched the amazing dubbing abilities of the ADV company, you would see they have some of the best English actors in the anime industry. I don't know how you qualify English actors as overrated and such, but to me ADV does great for comedy anime in an English language.

As for saying that, This Saiyuki series is utterly horrid. The acting voices have ALL been replaced by people with horrible acting skills (maybe this is why so many people are so avid about subbed shows) and poor ennunciation.

Simple and common names we are all so familiar with, such as ""Hakkai"" and ""Gojyo"" now sound like ""Hawkeye"" and ""Go-joe"" And small phrases we were all so fond of often hearing, like ""Stupid Monkey!"" and ""Pervey Water Sprite!"" are now replaced with ""Creepy Monkey"" and ""Louse Sprite""

The show itself in the English version has also seemed to have been toned down from a hilarious, witty comedy in Saiyuki, to a moreso meledromadic drama in Reload. It's almost not even funny at times, you see the funny facial expressions you know are common, but all that comes out are dull phrases.

As an added bonus, the soundtrack to the series (or the songs I have heard so far through this first DVD) are a major letdown and dissapointment compared to the other 2 Saiyuki volumes.

Saiyuki is probobly my all-time favorite anime, and if you are looking into getting Saiyuki or Saiyuki:Requiem, I would suggest them both 100% but if you are looking for that same nostalgic feeling from this series, then I wouldn't buy it.

Even as much as I greatly enjoy Saiyuki, I myself will not be buying the second DVD of this series. This series has been VERY poorly done, and I am very displeased with how Geneon has turned such a fine anime into such poor, second rate material.",1108425600,8,2064,4.539083557951482
2182313,1,B0006FFRJS,"I did enjoy the new outfits and music, however they got new writers and completely different voice actors.  I don't think that they even viewed any of the original series before recording the Reload series.  The character development is significantly off.  I would not recommend this series for anyone who has viewed the original series.  As a side comment, I'm not even sure that they didn't have different voice actors for Sanzo, Hakkai, Goyjo, and Goku.",1108339200,2,456,4.9605263157894735
2182314,2,B0006FFRJS,"I too am a big fan of the first 12 disc series, so I knew it would be a hard transition listening a new English voice cast dub on this series.  I couldn't follow the story either, since the new cast have voices familiar from other series, just not this one, making dialogue spoken off camera completely unidentifiable as to who said it.  But so far the episodes seem to cover the typical ""demon assassin of the week"" story line, so I don't think we are missing much yet.

The artwork is similar, but the color pallette is brighter and more suited to a Saturday morning cartoon.  The same limited animation style.  Not as many awkward 3d CGI elements thrown in (although now I kind of miss demons exploding into triangular particles...).

There is an amusing add on of the ""ura-sai"", which are perhaps 30 second comedic bits unrelated to the story...there is one tacked on to the end of each episode.  The new theme music is edgy and rockin'.  The language seems to have been toned down a bit, but that makes the characters seem even less like themselves.  Perhaps they are aiming for the younger, Saturday morning demographic now.  If you enjoyed the original english dub, I suggest renting this one before buying it...The new cast just doesn't have enough experience with these characters yet to express the depth of personality we already know.  Perhaps I'm being charitable, but maybe it's because the translation they are given to say comes across as awkward as well.  With almost every line spoken, your mind is almost screaming ""but Sanzo wouldn't say that!"".

But if you are a Japanese/subtitle fan, you are in luck, as that cast is the same.  For me, it was easier to watch the subtitled version, so not a complete loss, but still not a winner for the new company (Geneon).  I'll be renting the rest of these.",1108252800,,1817,4.616822429906542
2182315,1,B0006FFRJS,I Loved the first season and thought it was (is) one of the best anime out there but then they go and take the heart and soul from the characters by taking away their original voices.  I watched the movie and in the extras they said it would happen but I had hoped it was some kind of a mistake.  I recognize the voices in reloaded from other anime films and in those other films their voices fit but in Saiyuki they do not.  Like others I ran out to purchase Saiyuki Reloaded and found it disapointing to the point of not being able to follow the story line.  I am re-selling this item and will purchase no more of this series.  To me Saiyuki died with the lost voices.,1108080000,3,670,4.123076923076923
2182316,3,B0006FFRJS,"The artwork was beautiful and the opening and closing songs I can probably get used to, but the voice actors are simply put, LOUSY. Especially Sanzo and Goku. I'm so used to the voice actors in the previous series that this series does not even compare. There's no personality with these voice actors. It seems as though they are reading the script without feeling or thought which makes the characters boring. I've waited so long for this series to be released only to be disappointed by the poor job done by the voice actors in this DVD. They don't hold a candle to the first series or the movie. I've got all 12 volumes of the first series and I'm in love with that particular series, but this DVD was quite a let down for me. I don't know whose idea it was to choose such unfeeling, boring voice actors, and not use the same voice actors from the first series. Geneon just ruined a very good anime series by this unjust change. I think they should give the rights to ADVfilms and let them do it right before they ruin this series beyond repair.",1107993600,8,1048,4.37948717948718
2182317,1,B0006FFRJS,"The person who posted before basically summed up my problem with the new series.  ADV put out the first two seasons, and Geneon, formerly Pioneer, put out this new season.  The new voice acting blows. I don't mean just because the characters don't sound the same, but because the voice actors just really [...]..especially Sanzo (who seems to be doing a John Wayne impersonation) and Goku. I didn't check to see, but I hope I can set the DVD up to play in the original language with subtitles, because it's probably the only way I can enjoy it. Even then,  the animation doesn't look as good either..the colors are faded or something, and  nothing seems to stand out as it did in previous episodes. Whether that's Geneons fault or not, I don't know. Either way, Geneon should either give the rights for this series back to ADV or hire better voice actors that don't make up new pronounciation for character names, or, if possible, get the old voice actors to do it. It'd be a shame for Geneon to screw up one of the best anime series just because they wanted to have it. And if not, there's always bootlegs [...]",1107907200,6,1112,4.517412935323383
2182318,1,B0006FFRJS,"I've purchased all of the season one dvd's of Saiyuki and there isn't a bad one in the lot. I discovered that this season was coming out and I couldn't wait for the first volume to hit the shelves. I ran out and purchased it today, came home and put it on to watch. First thought that hit me when the first episode came on was: Who in the world is that? That is not Sanzo! All the voices are different!! That I could handle, happens quite a bit in anime. However you throw in the change of attitude, clothes and for crying out loud they mispronounce several names. Hakkai sounds a lot like Hawk-eye, can't even come up with a comparison for the way they say Kougaiji. I was so disappointed that I turned the dvd off after watching the first episode completely and scanning thru the rest of them. Not sure I'll even finish watching the one I have and it's very very unlikely that I'll purchase any more of this series.",1107820800,7,917,4.275862068965517
2182339,5,B0006FFRJS,"The soundtrack is fantastic. Some of Saiyuki episodes are hilarious and well depicted, others are darker and delve deeper into each characters mysterious - and shocking past.",1140307200,,174,5.481481481481482
2182340,5,B0006FFRJS,"Thus far the review on volume 1 has been unfair and mostly fuelled by the change in the English vocal cast. The Japanese vocal cast of the 4 protagonists is simply magnificent and why anyone wishes to watch Saiyuki in any dubbed version is beyond me. Too impatient to wait for the release of the English dub version, I have recently finished watching the rest of Reload and Gunlock (follow-up to Reload) in the Chinese sub/dub version. For those of us disappointed with the animation of Reload, be assure that the animation in Gunlock has greatly improved though I still miss the waif-like, pretty-boy lankiness of the protagonists as in the manga and the 1st series.
Reload has 25 episodes and Gunlock has 26 episodes and I am rating the total 51 episodes 5 stars. Reload is of a lighter tone and started off rather weak but Volumes 5, 6 and 7 which are faithful adaptation of the Manga volumes 6, 7,8 and 9 is very well done and a must-have. Saiyuki Gunlock started off with a relatively weak filler Episode 1, as noted by one of the reviewers. However that is the only flaw. The rest of Gunlock Episodes (2-13) are based on the Manga Reload and fillers which are not, are surprisingly very good. My favorite of the fillers is ""Snow drop"" which expresses the gentle brutality and poignancy of the same titled manga beautifully. Episodes 14 to 26 of Gunlock has a great story arc and should not be missed by any Saiyuki fan. So do yourself a favor and get Reload vol 5,6,7 and Gunlock.",1132963200,3,1486,4.5278810408921935
2182341,2,B0006FFRJS,"I loved Gensoumaden Saiyuki, especially the second season. The animation, the music, the plot, everything was perfect. But simply put, Saiyuki Reload is whack. They must have hired a completely new animation team because everything I loved about the original series is gone. What happened to the bright colors and sharp designs and artsy split-screens and overlays? The character designs have also changed for the worse. They veered away from Kazuya Minekura's stylishly lanky, angular designs, and instead we have  . . . Big Buff Sanzo and Co. What happened to the waifish, slanty-eyed bishounen we know and love?

The background music is OK, neither better nor worse than the original series, but the opening theme is just lame half-ass hard-rock-ish stuff. Overall, they seem to have tried ""shounen-izing"" the series so that it's more like your typical Saturday morning action anime.

Ultimately, the only thing that kept me watching was my desire to know what happens in terms of plot (again, I was disappointed; Saiyuki Reload is pretty much all filler) and the top-notch voice acting. A lot of people seem to have complaints about the American cast; I wouldn't know, since I firmly decided not to scar my virgin ears by watching the dub, but I'm sure it's awful, since people seem to prefer the original series' American cast and I thought they were still vastly inferior to the Japanese cast, who are utterly amazing. The hilarious Uru-sai segments only further serve to showcase the talent and impeccable ear for comedy of the Japanese voice-actors.

Overall, Saiyuki Reload is not worth buying, and only worth watching if you really, really can't get enough Saiyuki. I've started watching Gunlock (the sequel to Reload) and it doesn't seem to get any better. Me, I'll just stick to the original series, which is a masterpiece worth watching again and again.",1130889600,3,1866,5.029126213592233
2182342,1,B0006FFRJS,"I was all excited when i heard that they were going to continue the Saiyuki series. I loved the first 12 volumes and the Movie so much i couldn't wait to watch Reload

To my dissapointment, my excitment was short lived. The second i heard the characters speak i nearly fainted. It was horrible. The voice did not fit the characters at all. I don't know what they were thinking when they switched. They even changed the pronunciation of the characters names which grew irksome having known them to be something else. It's like someone giving you a new thats similar to your original one yet different.

Another thing was the grapics and the way the charaters were drawn. Characters such as Kogaji had been drawn to look much different then they did in the original episodes. They just looked odd. I am just going to try buying the manga so i don't have to listen to the characters talk.

I would seriously not advise buying this item. I think it was just a waste of my money and they ask for alot for it. You would think with the amount they ask that it would at least be diffferent. I am just going to stick with the original 13 done by good ol' ADV. I am seriously mad at Geneon for messing up this series that i loved.",1128729600,,1220,4.318777292576419
2182343,3,B0006FFRJS,"I agree with the general consensus that the new voice actors and dialogue don't fit with the characters as established with the first series.  Some of the new pronunciations make me cringe, and the ""new"" Hakkai sounds like he's positively flaming.  The character is cool enough not to need overkill!  The artwork seems to be pretty inferior at times, too.

Still, I enjoyed the opening and closing music, and the episode extras (Urasai) are hilarious.",1127001600,,451,4.973333333333334
2182344,2,B0006FFRJS,"I'm sure that I'm just going to repeat everything that others have said about Reload.  But there are a few things that really need to be said that were missed.

Whomever Geneon got to write the script must have had orders to make it Cartoon Network friendly.  They really toned down the banter between the four guys, especially Gojyo and Goku.  And the new pronounciations, there's one that everyone missed, Hawk-a-ry-u for our dear, sweet dragon/Jeep.

Now about the voices.  As someone who's nearly blind, I can't see the subtitles (and for some reason, friends and family don't like to be disturbed during the show to tell me what everyone is saying) so I rely on the American voice actors.  In the first fifty episodes and Requiem, the actors were real professionals, they were the characters and they sounded like they really were a team.  The new ones are cheap imitations.  Why Geneon would throw diamonds into the trash and replace them with glass, I'll never know.

I'm planning on buying the rest of the DVDs in the new series, just to see what happens.  But am hoping that Geneon will listen to the people that truly count in this deal and bring back the diamonds.",1126828800,,1175,4.655339805825243
2182345,3,B0006FFRJS,"Being a fan of the original series of Saiyuki, I definitely was eager to try out ""Saiyuki: Reload"" when I heard it was going to be released. I, being a fan of the ADV dubbed version, was a little wary about the new voice actors, and, as I think most everyone else who has reviewed has already established, the new voices are far below satisfactory.

As for the DVD itself, it doesn't have nearly the features the ADV DVDs had, meaning no Cultural Reference notes, Production Sketches, or cute little poster to hang up.

Turning to the episodes, the animation has changed greatly, although I wasn't very happy with the change. (A lot of people like the newer animation better, though, so it's up to you to decide.) To me it seemed like the backgrounds were much less detailed, and the characters' movements seemed to be someone choppy and short. The character's personalities seemed to have been altered slightly, as well. (Although this, too, is a matter of opinion.)

The episodes themselves weren't all that bad; the first two basically recapped what we already know, reintroducing us to the Sanzo party and the Kou-tachi, and stating their goals. The third episode involved a bunch of shikigami impersonators, and the last episode followed the story of a loner demon who was slowly being taken over by the negative aura.

All-in-all, I was definitely disappointed. If you really love the series, though, I'd keep buying the releases just to see what happens. I'm even going to watch the dubbed version, to see if any improvement is made. (And I can't concentrate as much when I'm scanning subtitles the whole episode.) Just keep in mind that it's nowhere near as good as the original Saiyuki series.",1114646400,,1702,4.798634812286689
2182346,3,B0006FFRJS,"I wish that I could give different ratings for this DVD. The episodes themselves were great and if you're a Saiyuki fan like me, it was good to see this refreshed view of the characters. Those of us who watched the original series would be the first to admit that the animation was nothing to write home about. Thankfully the animation seemed better this time around, with more attention paid to detail (like Goyjo's haircolor - finally it's proper blood-red). The action was tight and the re-introduction of all the characters went smoothly.

The storylines at first were mostly rehashing of what we'd seen in previous eposides, but they quickly improved for Episodes 3 & 4. There were quite a few humorous moments (like when Goku, Hakkai and Goyjo broke off from battle just for the chance to beat on Sanzo's dopleganger), and hopefully the plotline with continue to tighten up.

I can't critique the American voice actors since I never watch the dubbed verious, but the Japanese voice actors seemed to be the same from the original serious and the subtitles were accurate.

As for the DVD itself, it was more than dissapointing. I never heard of Geneon Entertainment before, but there were none of the extras that we were accustomed to seeing on the original series DVDs. I really missed the cultural notes and fold-outs that came with each DVD. For those who don't have a strong background in Asian mythology and the original text of the Journey West, the notes were very helpful in explaining some of the stuff going on and why certain things were important. The Urasai bits at the end of each episode were serious giggles, but not enough to make up for the loss of the other extras.",1110240000,7,1688,4.715254237288136

When I learned that Geneon had taken over the next two seasons of Saiyuki I knew they would use different actors for the roles of Sanzo and the gang. However, I didn't think they would massacre it like they have. Hakkai sounds a little too feminine, Sanzo's voice is too deep making him sound to  mean instead of sarcastic, Gojyo doesn't sound like a player he sounds like he's trying to sound seductive, and goku just doesn't sound like goku. The minor characters aren't given justice either.  Geneon screwed up big time and I have never had a problem with their releases. Geneon should have left the Saiyuki license alone and let ADV have it. Anyway, I probably will watch the rest of the series but only in Japanese. I don't know if I will continue to buy the series, but unless something changes that's up in the air. I still like the series because of the art work and the storylines so I am giving it three stars also because the Japanese actors salvaged the series for me.

Only a real fan would understand why they changed the voice actors at the second and third season-hello they're maturing as the episodes progress towards the end. You don't really expect to have the same voice when you age do you? It's realistic how they did it and I absolutely love the collection as well as the mangas. This is something i would definitely camp outside of a movie theater to see its big premiere (if there was one) lol! Enjoy the series and seek for understanding!

8041218,5,B0006FFRJS,Saiyuki Reload may not be as good as the original Saiyuki series but if you love the original Saiyuki you would definitely enjoy this one. The characters still go on their long journey to the west and the comedy is back with a whole new segment in every episode called Ura-Sai which is like a behind the scenes of the Saiyuki characters(not the voice actors)and its just a quick 1 to 2 minute extra on every episode that is always funny and can give you a good laugh. The action is also back and better then ever. The new music for this series is pretty good especially the opening song and the 2nd ending song. Highly recommended to any Saiyuki fan.,1215216000,,650,4.380165289256198

It's like the Geneon ""party"" read a review and started from there instead of watching the previous series and reading the support details.  I mean I thought it was funny the way Sanzo was always threatening to kill his cohorts and POINTED his gun at them.  Reload seems to be a watered down version of of the first two seasons.  Perhaps for US sales?

In all fairness, as the series progresses, Geneon does try to repair these mistakes in thier poor planing in subsequent volumes and the series get better and is worth buying.

I paid $39.95 for an English dubbed perfect collection.  I wouldn't want to have paid more though.  I hope Gunlock is better because I plan to buy it too.  Why?

The show changed director from Hayato Date(now on Naruto) to Tetsuya Endo (storyboard/Boogiepop Phantom, Director/Hikaru No Go) & he shifted the feel to our heroes as celebrities-we even first spy them in shades doing the low-profile thing. The Ura-Sai are possibly the best thing about a couple of the eps, but the title gets its sea legs by the mid-way point so the Kami arc works well.

The voices. Get over it. Anyone who listened to the commentary on Requiem heard David Matranga moved to New York & was flown in for that last commentary, but even had ADV kept Saiyuki, we'd have had a new Sanzo. Playing audio-track pop-over, Bang Zoom, as usual, did a much better job matching the dub voices to their original (In what universe does David Matranga sound like Toshihiko Seki? I love Greg Ayres, but he doesn't sound like Souichiro Hoshi. Same for Illich Guardiola/Hiroaki Hirata-picked to dub Captain Jack Sparrow in Kingdom Hearts 2-I can see there is a similarity to Johnny Depp's voice). And when I first heard ""Hawk-eye"" I did the audio track pop-over again. Yep, Souichiro Hoshi does sound like he's saying Hawk-eye. It took a bit to get familiar with the new voices, but since I usually watch Saiyuki twice(for each audio track), I can see the new dub is much closer to the original. The thing I love about Bang Zoom is they seem to pay more attention to the dub. Anyone who watched the Magic Knight Rayearth commentaries has to remember Lex Lang (Sanzo, also Sano/Rurouni Kenshin, Lantis\Zagato/MKR, King of En/12 Kingdoms, Crim/.hack//sign) discussing the cast sitting around listening to the original audio track to see how the Japanese cast played it. As much as I enjoy the usual ADV dub, they are one of the studios known to play it a bit fast & loose with the dub script (Kimera was played by Nobuo Tobita originally while ADV's dub played the character as a chick). As someone who regularly watches the English dub with the Japanese subtitles up to see how close the dub script ran, I regularly noticed ADV kept the spirit of the dub far more than a close translation.

On the Japanese side-either ADV mis-translated the name, or we have a different Dokugakuji-this time out Geneon is crediting Jurouta Kosugi(Zagato/Lantis/MKR).

My daughter did notice an improvement in the background characters. Date has said in interviews the studio cut it's teeth on computer animation with the first Saiyuki title & that's part of why the color-change on Goyjo's hair--red is a common background color so he preferred to steer clear of using it for one of the leads.

The only reason this is a star shy of perfect is the director's taking so long to figure out which direction to take the series. Once he decided to slip into the prior title's mode, it works well. If you really hate the dub, just listen to the original audio since Japan usually seems to pay far more attention to the vocal casting of the characters than America does.",1146355200,2,3182,4.673214285714286
8041222,4,B0006FFRJS,"Boxed set of what? 1 DVD & extras do NOT make a SET. I thought it was the whole series. I got season 1 from Hong-Kong; dual language, tri-language subtitling, excelent quality, entire series for $60 or less new. For the dubb the voices weren't bad, BUT it takes Sanzo's & Hakkai's voice actors a good 10 episodes to get a good FEEL for the personalities. In the first few episodes, Hakkai will use 'vulger' language & Sanzo will just sound 'wrong,' but when the actors effeminate Hakkai's tone & manners & deepen & soften Sanzo's tone it's just right.",1145404800,,551,4.52
8041223,3,B0006FFRJS,"Initially when I purchased this item I thought I was getting the series of Saiyuki Reload, thus was disappointed when I didn't (I guess I didn't investigate it thoroughly). I would recommend purchasing Volume 1 with the series box ONLY if you are a fan and know you want to collect the rest of the series. Also, for those who have not seen Saiyuki Reload, expect a shock when hearing the voices of Sanzo and Hakkai:  both have new actors voicing them and Sanzo now comes across far more gruff (and aged)while Hakkai reminds me of Data from Star Trek.  Overall,I am now glad that I purchased this as I do enjoy having a box to put the series in.  I plan to purchase the box for Saiyuki Gunlock when it is released.",1142467200,,713,4.345864661654136
