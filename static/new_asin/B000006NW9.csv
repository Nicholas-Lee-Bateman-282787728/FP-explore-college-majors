1196026,3,B000006NW9,"Firstly, I agree that Norma is 'not in the same league' as Aida, Rigoletto or Carmen. It is in a league ABOVE any of these except perhaps Carmen! Norma is a true, fully-sung, lyrical opera. Bellini stands alone in being capable of such a creation, and musically is rather more akin to Chopin than any opera composer. If only he had lived longer, and if only we had an early Callas performance on DVD!

I would like to add a few more words for this recording. While Dame Joan's once stupendously glorious voice is obviously in decline here (I should say worse than Callas in 1960 EMI), she's still much better off than many of our current Normas, and her dramatization has improved over the years. She fared better in the duets than in her painful opening recitative and aria, which she had to sing transposed, unlike in the past.

Although I've always preferred a soprano in this role, Troyanos was a fantastic Adalgisa, much more real than the campy performances of her rival Cossotto, and with a voice that is at once moving, rich and young similar to Christa Ludwig in the 1960 EMI.

Ortiz is a respectable Pollione, and not just because he hit the high 'C'. Diaz is also a good Oroveso.

But Bonynge's conducting leaves much to be desired. I was horrified by his cavalier direction and was left wondering what's this guy doing up there at all in the first place! He rushed through Oroveso's aria in a pace that ruined its beauty completely, and poor Diaz had a hard time trying to catch-up. The same thing happened over Adalgisa's lone musings which were rudely rushed over. And Pollion's aria. And the chorus Norma viene. He also took liberties to cut the orchestratal passages, and to interrupt the music to allow applause for Sutherland and Troyanos.

I regret how poor Dame Joan was deprived of a chance to work with great conductors such as Serafin. It would have helped improve her interpretation over what we have today. As it is this is a video made too late for her, and poorly conducted. If only she had done it with Abbado, Karajan, Bernstein or even Muti, a decade earlier!",1032220800,7,2089,4.589812332439679
1196027,2,B000006NW9,"This Opera may be considered among the better ones. Not in the league of Aida, or Rigoletto, or Carmen. However, well sung and presented, it can be made to exude magical qualities. With Joan Sutherland (JS) as Norma, and Tatiana Troyanos (TT) as Adalgisa, I expected a thoroughly satisfying experience. I had never before heard of Francisco Ortiz (FO, - as Pollione), but then this Opera is mainly for the lead female singers.
What do you have instead?
First of all, mono sound! Yes a mono recording made in 1981! Did not stereo recordings become standard in the `50's or `60's? Do the sound engineers (assuming there were any) at the Canadian Opera Company (COC), having failed to record in stereo, not heard of enhancing mono sound for stereo, without any loss in quality. Poor marks for this!
Then the lighting! Could the  COC not afford to pay their energy bills in the period preceding this presentation? As it is, there appears to be only one spotlight, and that shines brightly on the front and center stage. All else is dark and murky, and depressing. I cannot comment on the stage props or the costumes of almost all of the supporting performers, as they can barely be seen in the all-pervading shadows.
Then the performance! It might as well be a series of still photographs, with some movement in the lips to confirm that the performers were all alive and not cardboard cutouts. Was this really why the lighting was turned down? Even so, why were all the shots made from a static position? Did they have cameramen of average competence, to pan the cameras a bit, to put some life in the shots?
By the way, both JS and TT were supposed to be temple virgins, but they played what they were at the time - stogy middle-aged. women. FO deservedly did not go very far in the opera world. In that, justice was subsequently done.
No libretto was supplied, and this has become standard for DVD presentations. It is needed in this case however, as the English sub-titles (which incidentally, cannot be turned off), are very sparing. A lot of the nuances in the singing were therefore lost.
The opera did end eventually, or I should really say, expire. This presentation, which lacked dynamic energy and was quite boring at times, simply fizzled out an the end
Then why do I still give it two stars? Simply because JS's singing was generally superb, and so to a lesser extent, was TT's. Viewed as a presentation of arias, and not as a whole opera, there were redeeming moments.
Please avoid this DVD, which certainly does not deserve a premium price. Buy something else instead, and wait for another presentation to do some justice to Bellini's good composition.",996451200,32,2662,4.688034188034188
1196028,3,B000006NW9,"Things, as W.B. Yeats famously observed, fall apart.  Here in this vale of tears, there is certainly no shortage of reminders, memento mori, that ""the center cannot hold.""  This DVD is, among other things, such a reminder.  By 1981, Sutherland's voice had clearly begun its journey south.  This performance, with the Canadian Opera Company, betrays an instrument that, while still agile and capable above the staff, is frankly painful to listen to below it.  The first 15 minutes or so, then, including the excruciatingly aweful ""Casta Diva"" should simply be skipped, except by the morbidly curious.  Toward the end of Act I, however, Sutherland has warmed up, and there are moments, most notably in the great ensemble pieces, and her opening second act scene, where this recording more than justifies its flawed existence.
That said, there will be too much to forgive for some viewers:  impresario Bonynge's pedestrian conducting, the frankly amateur chorus and supporting singers, the Pollione of Fransisco Ortiz, who has nice legs but who may never have had a single musical thought, and the dreadful quality of the videography. Sometimes a night at the opera is as much an act of loyalty as pleasure, and very few singers have as fair a claim to such loyalty as does Sutherland.  Buying a video might also be such an act, but no one should be fooled into believing that this video is an exemplary document.  It is not.
Of course afficionados will want it anyway, and there is still much to recommend it.  First, every time Troyanos took the stage, everything about the production, including Dame Joan's voice, improved.  Thus, the vocal highlights of this DVD are certainly the great Norma/Adalgisa duets.  Second, even though Sutherland's voice is half-gone (and I can't stress enough how truly painful the ""Casta Diva"" is on this DVD), in 1981, she still had remarkable chops in the fioritura department.  Third, and not least, although there is another Sutherland *Norma* floating around out there on VHS, I believe it's out of print, and it was fairly distressing in its own right anyway.  That means that this is the only available video performance of this greatest of all non-Verdi Italian operas.
This DVD gets three stars for one reason only:  Troyanos, who lit up my life every moment of this performance in which she appeared, and who coaxed what greatness was left from La Stupenda in the duets.  That means you'll probably want to have it despite its flaws.  But forewarned is forearmed: If your expectations aren't too high, you'll probably enjoy the virtues of this recording, even while enduring its faults.",992044800,31,2627,4.974828375286041
1196029,4,B000006NW9,"This recent release from VAI of Bellini's Norma with Joan Sutherland is a must have for any serious opera video collector. The performance from Toronto on May 4, 1981 features, along with Sutherland, the Adalgisa of Tatiana Troyanos, the Oroveso of Justino Diaz and the Pollione of Francisco Ortiz.  Richard Bonynge conducts.  The production is traditional (a relief in these days of ghastly, updated, Star Wars/Eurotrash productions), with rocks, spears, robes, Druid warriors in animal skins, with helmets and even horns!  But the most important reason to own this video is the pairing of Joan Sutherland and Tatiana Troyanos.  There are many wonderful documentations of the Sutherland/Horne duets -- and they are unforgettable, but this rarer coupling is quite exciting because the duets are taken in the original key and at the end of the second duet, Troyanos matches Sutherland on an exultant High C that brings the house down. Watching this and her other videos of Les Troyens, Cavalleria, Don Carlo, and Rosenkavalier from the MET just highlights what a tragic loss her early passing was to the musicworld.  Sutherland is in fine voice, warming up as the evening progresses.  Her authority and ability to convey the many moods of this heroine silence the critics who say she could not act -- simply look at the expressions on her face when learning of Pollione's betrayal and her subsequent  confrontation with him.  Ortiz gives a solid performance, though
not a memorable one in the class of Domingo or Carrerras.  He is a handsome Pollione and his legs are on show most of the evening.  Richard Bonynge's conducting is stylish and idiomatic, always giving the singers enough room for expression and rubato. The subtitles are not removable and there is an intrussive  announcer between scenes and at the curtain calls.  Video quality is fine (much improved over the ""pirate"" Beta and VHS tapes which have floated around for years.  This performance comes highly recommended although there is no region code listed on the box or on the enclosed and very minimal chapter sheet. Also try and find the ANNA BOLENA which has been released  along with this NORMA -- that IS truly a classic with the young James Morris and Judith Forst joining Sutherland with fireworks of their own.",988329600,35,2285,5.01058201058201

7904573,4,B000006NW9,"Norma has become my all time favorite opera, over Boheme, Carmen and Traviata.  I love melody!  That's Donizetti.  I've been collecting Norma DVD's/  This one is well worth owning.  There are problems.  Mostly in the filming and recording.
But thinking Toronto and not the Met or Milan it is better than I expected.

And as for Norma of course I'm a Callas devotee.  But this is also Sutherland's role too.  I'm just not a Sutherland fan.  However, saying that I did thoroughly enjoy her performance.  And the duets between her and Troyanos were worth listening to again and again.  They really put it together delightfully.  I happen to also find Ortiz as Pollione especially convincing.  Both his signing and his acting and as handsome a man as he is, perfect for the role of a lkoverboy who'd carry away two lovely ladies.

The conductor seemed to me gained in his enthusasm by the second act.  And I kind of love seeing conductors do their thing.  I am a fond devotee of Levine at the Met even in his wheelchair.  So this conductor has his competition with me.

I think the critics of this DVD are aficionados who are so critical ought to stop showing off their erudition, sit back and enjoy with the rest of us.",1510272000,,1216,4.546296296296297

I did not know who Francisco Ortiz was, but his matinee idol looks (think Christopher Reeves) led to an internet search, and he is indeed an very important Spanish tenor, just not so well known on this side of the great divide (like my beloved Giacomo Aragall).  A traditional, at times refreshinghly stodgy production.  Bonynge, his usual energetic self.  Did Sutherland record with anyone else?  Vocally, I found nothing to nitpick about.

7904578,3,B000006NW9,"I must agree with many of the reviews that the Casta Diva is less than a success.  Sutherland had a cold during the run of this production and the Casta Diva coming early in the opera showed the limitations this imposed on her singing.  It seems she could not get enough breath to support and long phrases required of the piece.

In the early years she would have managed her voice with a lot more aplomb.  Here she simply runs out of air.  Whenever Sutherland was ill it was her lower register that was affected first.

Her voice did warm up as the opera progressed as was customary with Sutherland and her duets with Troyanos were quite special.  Troyanos really knew her voice and how to use it.

I saw Sutherland later in her career when there was a lot of transposing going on but her voice even in later years sounded better much of the time than it does here.  Unfortunate timing for a cold.",1239235200,,898,4.36144578313253
7904579,2,B000006NW9,"""Norma"" is an opera fanatic's battleground, for so few singers can actually stand up and SING it.  And, if you are a rabid Callas fan

there is only one Norma:  La Divina herself.  That said, that

Sutherland in 1981 could even approximate the role speaks volume for her technique and will.  What is unforgivable about this production is her Halloween costuming and the conducting of Bonynge: his self indulgent hand waving pushes the tempi into

carnival music, and he seems to NEVER phrase or let the singers

breathe.  Those of us spoiled to Seraphin have trouble forgiving him.

Sutherland seems to warm into the role, and dramatically catches fire only at the end of the opera, although vocally one can hear her (valiant) struggle in the lower register. Ultimately she won me over,

and I was prepared to hate her, and everything she did after the

""Casta Diva"".

The triumph of this video, one thing that makes it worth having

and watching is the work of Troyanos. Watching her is a study

in Italian vocal technique, with squillo to burn.",1128902400,9,1046,4.733333333333333
7904580,4,B000006NW9,"I find the reviews a real puzzle. It seems that there are two distinct dvds of this Canadian opera production: I have one version and nearly everyone else has another. Sutherland's ""casta diva"" is not ugly. It is finely sung. There is no strain. The timber is rich as always Forte singing is full, rarely on the edge and always movingly sung. When she joins Troyanos in the duets the singing does become greater. Soft notes are beautiful to  hear. If Ortiz as  Pollione is not the best, he deserves much more credit  than he gets for the good singing that he does deliver. He doesn't sound under parted to me. If a reviewer has to compare him to Corelli or Del Monaco that's their loss. Few can match either of them. Troyanos triumphs as most reviewers agree. Her loss will never be replaced for its sincerity, integrity, beauty of timber and the radiance of her personality. Diaz and the rest of the cast are also fine. I think Bonynge does a really good job with the orchestra. He has often been under-appreciated and unjustly maligned. The overture is a little fast but in general everyone does themselves credit. The four stars I give is with reluctance, it deserves five, but the sound and picture quality are distracting  at time. The packaging is up roar. The video is dedicated  the memory of Tatiana Troyanos which I thought was a very professional touch.  This dvd deserves to be seen and  heard. You may not buy it but I don't think you'll regret having heard it either.  The Caballe Norma is extraordinary.. Tat l'Orange  performance is immortal.  Comparisons make us partisans not lovers of beautiful music beautifully sung. I am very happy to have this dvd in my collection.",1121644800,32,1688,4.653198653198653
7904581,3,B000006NW9,"Troyanos is the most exciting presence and singer in this production. Both Norma  (Sutherland) and Pollione are not great, but they are more exciting when Troyanos is on stage. Sutherland must have been history by the time this was made. I have heard her on cd's and I know her voice was tremendous. This DVD does not convey at all why she became  famous and was called ""La Stupenda."" Not at all.
The only thing I can say about Pollione is he looks pretty good in short armour, remembering he's supposed to be a warrior (therefore solid looking); his singing did not interest me.
The production itself is not so great: the sound vanishes periodically (during arias!) and the sub-titles are erratic at best, vanishing for  whole chunks of time. I would not buy another disc from this company unless I were certain that production values (and subtitles) were better and the star singers in better form.",1034640000,7,900,4.719745222929936
