8219858,5,B000TXY2E8,"Incredible performance, concept and singing.",1514073600,,44,8.0
8219859,3,B000TXY2E8,"I bought this DVD two months ago despite the perceptive and helpful observations of others. I thank you, and should have been forewarned, but I wanted a performance by Vladimir Galuzin as Gherman. This was the only one around. I watched this DVD twice straight through, and I'm sure I won't look at the whole thing again. It should be reserved for old opera hands with strong stomachs and a high tolerance for cognitive dissonance. It should NOT be one's first or only experience of a wonderful opera.

Just a couple of points to add to criticism already made. Little is gained by Lev Dodin's ""new dramaturgy"" and a lot is taken away. Pushkin's original story only ends in the mental hospital - it is mentioned in the last lines of the novella - and the story is not framed as the hero's retrospective reenactment of past life and delusions.  The few interesting changes - having Lisa ""read"" her letter to Gherman in Act III; redistributing the Pastoral so that Gherman, Liza and the Countess take part, increasing the singing load on the leads, but adding nothing to understanding [now Gherman must choose between the rich countess and sincere Liza, as the shepherdess Prilepa originally decides between the poor shepherd and the rich Zlatogor] -- seem random. Gone is the St. Petersburg presence. No Embankment in the asylum, no Summer Garden, no wine, no pistols - well, just leave it out or rewrite the text!!

""Creative"" directors should remember that Tchaikovsky needed the libretto his brother Modest finally gave him.  He could not get his head around composing a treatment of Pushkin's dry, elegant novella. He wanted the Petersburg setting, the impoverished hero whose sincere passion leads him to fatally transgress the moral/social/economic order to make marriage to a noblewoman possible; the gradual descent into obsession, murder, madness, and finally, suicide.  Tchaikovsky's opera has as much of the early ""romantic"" Dostoevsky - an ""insulted and injured"" ""little person"" challenges an impregnable social order and perishes - as it does Pushkin. Directors should respect the composer and the text. If a director wants an opera of Pushkin's QUEEN OF SPADES, he should write a new libretto and commission appropriate new music. Otherwise, he deserves a visit from Tchaikovsky's vengeful ghost....

Atypical for a Russian opera, PIKOVAYA DAMA belongs to the lead tenor; he sings in every scene over a three hour stretch. At present, Vladimir Galuzin owns this role. He has stamina and endurance in addition to a huge voice, and plays well with others. He has the acting chops and psychological acuity to limn Gherman's devolution from passion-obsessed romantic lover to gambling-obsessed suicidal murderer. Though not conventionally pretty and beginning to show his age(50ish), Galuzin has commanding charisma onstage. Obviously, he can even pull off Gherman in a bathrobe and grungy pjs, but does he have to?

In looking for a watchable, more traditional performance than Dodin's, I was able to find a ""limited edition"" DVD of the current Mariinsky production by Alexander Galibin, conducted by Valery Gergiev, broadcast by the BBC in February, 2007. The cast partially overlaps Dodin's: Galuzin is Gherman, with Putilin and Bogacheva; Tatiana Borodina sings Liza and Vladimir Moroz, Yeletsky.  It is a minimalist staging: an 1830s St Petersburg is barely suggested, principals are dressed in neutral colors, while the ball scene/ballet/gambling house are garish and psychedelic. There is some unnecessary stage business with non-singing extras. Characters are herded on and offstage by giant black and white scrims that represent their inner states - an annoying and unnecessary effect, but not fatal. Most important, the music and text are respected, and the staging keeps out of the singers' way. (Nothing here for the Eurotrash Hall of Shame.)  It's a wild ride in which Gergiev directs a strong cast, masterfully ratcheting up tension from beginning to end. You can actually look at and listen to a riveting performance without disgust. For now, this will have to do.

If you want a handsome, traditional Petersburg production from DVDs now available, and don't mind bad acting, the Gergiev/Kirov with Gregorian/Guleghina looks and sounds fine; or you can get the CDs and just listen.  The Glyndbourne DVD is interestingly staged and acted, but marred fatally, I feel, by Yuri Marusin's hollow, reedy singing and  bizarre acting.

My hypothetical ""desert island DVD"" would be a Mariinsky/Kirov ""traditional"" staging - St Petersburg in Catherine II's time or the 1830s. Galuzin sings Gherman, Gergiev conducts; Putilin, Bogacheva, and other Mariinsky stalwarts would provide fine support. I'd like to see Karita Mattila as Liza, a big voice, with passion and acting ability to match Galuzin's. The ideal Yeletsky would combine a glorious voice for his big Act II aria with the heft to cope with the Act I duet (with/against the tenor) and quintet, and the final showdown- Hvorostovsky, Chernov, Ludovic Tezier would all be fine.  When????

If you like Galuzin, you might want to locate his other performances. The spelling he uses on his websites is ""Galouzine"" (for Francophones, so they pronounce it approximately correctly, since he lives and works often in France). ""Galuzin"" is the direct Cyrillic-to-English transcription, pronounced with the stress on the second syllable. You may also find him listed as ""Galusin,"" so research all three.

A principal at the Mariinsky/Kirov since 1990, Galuzin is in the ensembles for their Philips CD releases: SADKO, KHOVANSHCHINA, INVISIBLE CITY OF KITEZH, GAMBLER (another signature role for him) et al. He also appears in recent Western DVDs of PAGLIACCI and KHOVANSHCHINA. Excerpts performances of PIKOVAYA DAMA and other operas are posted at Galuzin's websites, on YouTube, and at the website of the Paris music study center Nouvel Opera, where he has taught master classes.",1219968000,9,5941,5.224789915966387
8219860,1,B000TXY2E8,"I have almost nothing to add to what other reviewers said, except that I also don't like musical performance - Rozhdestvensky's tempi are ""strange""... Just want to put 1 star to bring the average grade down. Also, adding to the discussion about good DVD recordings of this opera - check 1992 Glyndebourne production (Andrew Davis conducting). If you can agree, that Herman/Yuri Marusin is very impressive even despite he cannot sing (or maybe exactly because of that) - you'll love it! If you don't like this kind of singing - you may still like this performance, because all others (especially Tomsky/Sergey Leiferkus) are magnificent.",1210809600,2,636,5.125
8219861,2,B000TXY2E8,"I purchased this video on the heels of having seen and heard Vladimir Galouzine sing performances of this opera with the Kirov Opera in Washington. (He's to this role what Lauritz Melchior was to Wagner, and I don't say that lightly.)  As others have said so well, this production is a nightmare.  Can any concept be more clichd than staging this in an asylum with a character who admitted GOES mad already mad from the get-go?  The more modern stagings you have seen, the more of the visuals you will recognize quoted here.

The singing is superb.  Galouzine's impressiveness is a given, but I was pleasantly surprised by how wonderful Pappian's Liza is -- fully ""in the picture"" in a way one might not expect from her Normas.

I wish I could say that just listening and not watching made this a satisfactory production.  Even if you do not find the conducting sluggish, there are inexcusable cuts and alterations, presumably at the whim of the director's concept.  In the first act, for example, the choral episode is missing from the storm scene. In the embankment scene, Liza sings extensively altered text to compensate for the fact that German is right under her nose when the original would require her to say that there is no sign of him.

Galouzine's final number in the gambling scene is perfect -- it almost makes up for everything else on the video.  But what a pity that this and not the Kirov's current production is preserved on DVD!",1200355200,6,1448,4.665354330708661
8219862,3,B000TXY2E8,"The quotation that forms my review's title is from Hermann, the opera's protagonist, but could just as well be from stage director Lev Dodin, who has imposed on Tchaikovsky's opera a concept at first puzzling, then increasingly tedious, and finally ruinous. Hermann is floridly psychotic throughout, and the action is staged in an asylum. For the greater portion of the 180-minute running time, we stare at green walls and an institutional bed in an otherwise empty room. At first it seems that the scenes staged are Hermann's remembrances of the events that drove him mad. The other characters are trotted out on a catwalk running the length of the rear wall, and they wear non-institutional clothing of the type we would see in a typical period production of PIKOVAYA DAMA. But at other points, characters from Hermann's past seem also to be fellow patients (two burly orderlies deliver Chekalinsky in time for him to get Act II rolling), and characters weave in and out of Hermann's asylum and non-asylum existences. The mezzo who breaks up Lisa's party in Act I Scene 2 seems to work part time as what she was in the libretto (Lisa's governess) and part time as the head nurse of the institution.

The viewer who manages to endure all three hours of this static muddle will be left with many questions, and a regret that the production is not arresting enough to make anyone spend more than a minute pursuing their answers. Is Lisa (who does not commit suicide here, but survives the opera) supposed to be visiting Hermann at the institution in the ""present day"" in some of these scenes (like the one in which the nurse/governess chats with her while taking Hermann's pulse and making notations on his bed chart)? Or is Hermann merely remembering his and Lisa's previous encounters and superimposing his present milieu on them, in cooperation with the bargain-basement minimalism favored by Dodin? One begins to wonder if everything in Dodin's production is the delusional imaginings of the mental patient. Probably closer to the mark is a suspicion that Dodin is using the psychosis of his Hermann as a dramatic crutch for an inchoate and dramatically unstable production; he believes it has liberated him from consistency. As is typical of directors of our era, especially those active in Europe, his disdain for the banality of a ""straight"" presentation of what the composer and librettist provided is such that he prefers to spend hours hammering the square pegs of an opera's dramatic situations into the round hole of a directorial conceit that should have been aborted within minutes of conception.

It is also worth mention that lines of the libretto are added, subtracted, and reassigned with unusual audacity. As if we needed an additional prompt that this Hermann is insane, he has been given jarring new dialogue in the first scene: he rants and shouts in an attempt to get the attention of the little boys playing soldier games, and they respond by looking contemptuous and repulsed (hallucinated children are better heard than seen, I guess). The role of the Major Domo has been eliminated, it having no place in Dodin's reimagining. In one of the few good alterations (though one likely still to offend staunchest sensibilities), Dodin has the Countess appear to speak/sing her lines in Tomsky's Act I narration. He repeats the gimmick with Lisa's lines at the beginning of Act III, which in the libretto belonged to Hermann as he read aloud from Lisa's letter. The intermezzo with the ""Dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses"" is also at odds with the institutional milieu, so we get choristers dressed as mental patients, blindfolding each other and staggering around. Confusingly, Lisa and the Countess also participate. The roles of Prilepa and Milovzor in the vocal portion of the divertissement are not assigned to singers brought in for the occasion, but are performed by the portrayers of Lisa and Hermann. One expects, then, the baritone singing Yeletsky to play the third member of the triangle, Zlatogor, with his temptations of the heroine with ""mountains of gold and precious stones."" Surprisingly, and of mild dramaturgical interest, this part is assumed instead by the Countess. There are unsuccessful attempts to make the production seem more cinematic with awkward interpolations of stock gambling footage (hands holding cards, chips falling, and the like).

If it is difficult for me to imagine any devotee of this opera willingly watching the DVD more than once, it is equally difficult for me to imagine anyone only wanting to hear the performance once. Conductor Gennadi Rozhdestvensky leads the forces of the Paris Opera in a  sympathetic and often thrilling traversal of the colorful score, and his cast is without true weak link. The tireless Vladimir Galouzine justifies his solidifying reputation as one of the greatest Hermanns vocally, and he is an energetic actor who does what he can to realize Dodin's ideas. He often seems to be channeling Geoffrey Rush as David Helfgott, though in the scene with the spurning of Lisa, there is a brief detour into Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance. Stocky and coarse-featured, he is not physically ideal for what he is asked to portray. To be really touched by this Hermann, especially in this close-up format, we would need a physical type not often found among men who can sing the role -- someone more delicate and inward. Hasmik Papian excels at looks of grave concern, and her dignified and mature Lisa is a winning assumption in spite of edginess at the top of a big voice. Irina Bogatcheva's Countess, pace descriptions of other characters, is no old crone, either physically or vocally. One senses that she could have brought more ambiguity to her earlier scenes in a better-thought-through production, but she makes the most of her almost director-proof reverie in Act II. As she wistfully recalls her youth, her slow, graceful dance in white nightgown, long hair loosened, provides the production's one indelible image. Baritones Nikolai Putilin and Ludovic Tezier, as Tomsky and Yeletsky respectively, provide capable support, the former overcoming an early tendency to begin in the vicinity of a note and slither up or down to specification. Christianne Stotijn's Polina, warm and genial where Papian's Lisa is circumspect and wary, makes a vivid impression in her brief time on stage, and sings beautifully.

This superb audio recording of an irresistible Romantic opera, weighed down with unpleasant and futile pictorial baggage, is virtually an advertisement for a DVD audio-ripping program. I leave you to do what you will with that qualified recommendation, just as I leave this production's Hermann to thrash about in his sleep at the asylum, perhaps dreaming of a topsy-turvy alternate reality in which his chaotic mind and severed acquaintance with logic and reason would qualify him not for institutionalization but for a career as a stage director.",1198368000,4,6951,5.06195462478185
8219863,4,B000TXY2E8,"I was attracted to this DVD because of the mostly Russian cast, Papian is from Armenia when it was part of the Soviet Empire and would speak Russian witht the fluency of a native speaker.  As regards the singing I can only speak with high praise.  Galouzine has aged since he appeared in the Sadko, but the voice is still thrilling.  I heard his Otello from the Met and was not impressed.  He is much more at home in his native language and he gives a performance of his lifetime.  Papian also would appear much more at home in this role than the one she is currently singing at the Met--Norma (I know she has made two or three DVD's in this role but that doesn't make it right!).  Ludovic Tezier is French, but I assume the first name would indicate a slav somewhere in the family tree.  The role of Yeletsky is a step above that of a comprimario, but he has one of the most beautiful baritone arias ever written and he sings it beautifully, almost on a par with Lisitsian who remains the benchmark for this role.  Bogatcheva is excellent as the Countess.  Indeed I have no problem with the singing.  But the rub.  The production by Lev Dodin is hopeless.  He sets it in an asylum; Gherman is mad from the getgo and his costumes have no period while others have a vague period flavor. He favors the now du riguer black overcoat for many of the scenes.  Since it makes no sense for an asylum to be the locale for the Countess' bedroom a few props are moved in but the overall effect is pointless.  Bogatcheva is able to convey the power of her great scene and is almost as effectie as Resnick was when I saw her in San Francisco in the mid seventies but it is an uphill battle that she and the rest of the cast shouldn't have to fight.

So what to make of the whole thing?  The options are small.  The only other ""live"" performance is the Gergiev production which is stodgy and old fashioned.  Gergiam is hardly a romantic figure and his singing is stentorian and lacks nuance.  Ghuligina at the beginning of her career is more at home in her native repertoire, but she is a crude and unfinished singer. If the Met ever releases its version with Domingo and Gorchakova options become greater and more difficult. In Russian opera I would prefer to hear native speakers. The style is illusive but not impossible for foreign singers to master.  This new TDK performance is valuble for the singing and I am glad to have it in my collection. Alas because of the production I now feel it is necessary to supplement it with a more specific (18th century Russia)sense of locale.",1195603200,6,2570,4.393234672304439
8219864,2,B000TXY2E8,"Visually, this production is a disaster. The director simply destroyed the charm of Tchaikovsky's creation in a twisted way. This is really frustrating, because musically this is an excellent production. Listen with your TV closed...",1193011200,10,233,5.685714285714286
8219865,4,B000TXY2E8,"Tchaikovsky wrote this masterful setting of Pushkin's eerie blend of the supernatural and overweening human obsession while living in Florence during 44 days of frenzied creation early in 1890. The libretto was written by his brother Modest. Although Tchaikovsky was originally reluctant to write this opera, upon its completion he was convinced it was his masterpiece. It is certainly a splendid match of beautiful music and inspired story telling.

But you lose much of that superb fit in this puzzling production. Director Lev Dodin has ""reimagined"" the story, which now takes place entirely in the protagonist's mentally unbalanced mind as he is confined to a psychiatric hospital in St. Petersburg. As Hermann lies in a grungy, bare hospital bed in an otherwise empty ward, the stage is horizontally split into a second level, where much of the action of the opera now takes place. Since the ""reimagined"" opera occurs in Hermann's maddened brain, characters are paraded along the (metaphorical) split level in their very own grungy dressing gowns as if they, too, are psychiatric inmates. This is, quite simply, not what Tchaikovsky wrote.

Also, this production is essentially monochromatic. There are no real, substantive changes of sets or scenery. Whatever small changes do occur keep the same visual line, are devoid of color and are essentially an abstraction. The scenery is predominantly that single hospital bed and one long institutional wall with a catwalk attached. For what it's worth, the loss of color and beauty doesn't work for me in this case (it has in abstract productions of different operas). After all, this is Pique Dame by Tchaikovsky and not Wozzeck by Alban Berg.

Of course, if this opera were poorly sung or conducted it wouldn't matter all that much. But it isn't. All of the singers are splendid. Conductor Gennadi Rozhdestvensky does an exemplary job with the Opera national de Paris. Vladimir Galouzine sings a splendid Hermann. Irina Bogatcheva is an excellent Countess. Hasmik Papian is a good Lisa. The entire musical production is excellent. The video production is equally good. Sound in DD 5.1, DTS 5.1 and PCM stereo is clear and well recorded. It is the director's vision that I find lacking. And this is endemic to modern European productions generally. To quote Tolstoy: ""What is to be done?""

If you think you can deal with this dreary setting, you will gain a well sung, beautifully played Pique Dame. Though you might be more forgiving than I, nevertheless, caveat emptor. Be aware of what has been done to this beautiful opera. If you're in doubt, you probably should pass it by.
