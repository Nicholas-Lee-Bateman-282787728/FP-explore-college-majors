It's a gritty, action-packed film, which is just the way I like them. Justin Lazard is an extremely underrated actor, in my opinion. He carries the film on his shoulders all the way through, making it a very believable character. Too bad that he didn't get the breaks he should have gotten after this film. Species 2 was the only major movie he managed to star in. Too bad. For the life of me, I don't understand why so many people dislike Dead Center. Oh well. To each their own, I suppose.",1338854400,,638,4.237704918032787

It is not about disappointments, since I knew what I was letting myself into when I watched it, but then again B movies are an interesting genre in themselves and can be quite entertaining in a sort of 'empty your mind and just go with the flow' way..But there is a difference between B and A as in Awful. But then again Golan is as I mentioned renowned for making cheap films without any artistic value whatsoever. This is done with three easy steps,
Firstly, get bad actors whose abilities and talents will not cause De Niro or Pacino any sleepless nights.
Secondly, use the same screenplay from other movies and just if possible change the names and locations.
And thirdly,just throw your lot in the video market hoping that the attraction of the Ramboesque ideals and values are still alive and kicking with some viewers.
Dead Center has all these elements and more..it is  simply too boring for words,(with the exception of the gorgeous and sexy Rachel York who is a good actress and singer in her own right, and whose talent is totally wasted here).
The ending of the film is probably the lamest and most ridiculous one I have ever seen (with the sole exception of a Brazilian film called Giselle where everyone sleeps with everyone else and when the filmmakers got stuck they ended their movie just suddenly and with no prior warning or background with a nuclear holocaust).
So I strongly advise you to avoid this film at all costs, not that I hope many will be interested anyway..",1082246400,,1701,4.651162790697675
