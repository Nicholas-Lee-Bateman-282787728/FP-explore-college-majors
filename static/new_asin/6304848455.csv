It may be speculative fiction of a sort, but it's based on premises all Shakespeare fans have thought about at length.  The first tape was good, but by the end of the third tape, it had me completely.  VHS quality bothered me far more than the made-for-tv production values.  MANY good performances in this, IMHO.  BTW, I'm not a Curry zealot, I've never even seen Rocky Horror.",1221350400,8,457,4.6625
7878566,1,6304848455,"Well, with all due respect to the brilliant actors associated with this production I must heartily disagree with the previous good reviews, evidently penned by rabid Tim Curry fans, of this disenchanting mini-series.  I felt Ian McShane, in particular, was totally wasted in his role and although Tim Curry did the best that could be done, with the sub par material, he was altogether forgettable in the lead.  The ambling, misguided, largely fictional account of William Shakespeare's life was aided somewhat by adequate production values, but was not worthy of being aired on primetime TV, in the US.  In fact the ABC network considered showing it, at one time, but was rightfully disappointed with its clumsy, substandard contents.  View it if you must, Tim Curry aficionados, but everyone else, I just thought you should be warned...",1209600000,16,837,5.132352941176471
7878567,5,6304848455,"This production is a masterpiece, and Tim Curry is as good an actor as ... well... Tim Curry can only be!

Brilliantly written and acted, with marvelous costumes, this is a must for any lover of history, the stage ... and, in case I didn't mention -- Tim Curry!",1196380800,18,261,4.326530612244898
