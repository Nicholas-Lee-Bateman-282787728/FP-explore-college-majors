2875823,5,B000RW3Z1W,"Donnie Yen has an impressive body of work.
Some of his films are good,some not.
This collection is not his very best but they all are decent films.
High Voltage is probably the best of the bunch and Satan Returns has the least action. It's more of a horror/thriller but it shows Donnie Yen can act in a non martial arts films.
Circus Kids is old school action with Yuen Biao in the lead.
Donnie has a fight scene with Bey Logan from Dragon Dynasty so any of you who even wanted to see him get his butt beat get the chance to do so.
Cinema of Vengeance is a documentary which is the best made on the genre.
It's all action with some great interviews including Donnie. Some great clips of him from his Tiger Cage films too.
Quality on all prints is very good.
All are english except for Satan Returns which is subtitles.",1191024000,6,818,4.25
8202701,2,B000RW3Z1W,Video source appears to be from VCD's.  Dark City looks to be a VCD put on VHS and then on DVD. One movie you have two audio channels that play together. I checked Videoasia's webpage and did not see this collection listed. I think this may be a bootleg and not worth the money at all. I added some screenshots from each movie to show you the quality.,1449100800,2,351,4.161764705882353

8202708,1,B000RW3Z1W,"Videoasia/Panmedia is notorious for taking public access movies and re-release them to rip fan off. These are the exact transfers from old vhs tapes, being so lazy High Voltage does not even have the right audio (Japanese instead of Cantonese). Back in 2001, 2002 where you have to grab everything you can find if you are a big fan, this might be a healthy welcome. However at this day and age, vhs transfers? really?

If you want this so bad, go to youtube, youtube is enlarging their collection with public access stuff, i'm sure you can find them somewhere.

This is so bad I wish amazon allows me to rate 0 star. This is a review from someone who has bought this package and forever regret.",1283126400,30,694,4.5
