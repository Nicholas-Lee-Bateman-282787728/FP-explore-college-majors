Because of a battle with their mortal enemies of the planet Plundar, the only ship that makes it through is that of the nobles, the Thundercats. Due to the damage from the battle they must choose a new world to carry on the legacy of Thundra, a familar planet called Third Earth.
Man I loved this show as a kid! The writting was first rate and.. the memories, I had every toy there was.
But did you ever wonder why Lion-O grew into adulthood during their voyage but Willy Kitt and Katt did not? And why didn't the others grow older like Jaga did?
I don't really want an answer, but I can wonder.
And another thing, I guess that Jaga is supposed to be a jaguar(like Lion-o is a lion and Panthro is a panther etc..) but did you ever notice that he was the only Thundercat that didn't look like a cat at all?",1070668800,2,896,4.245614035087719
7803876,4,6300154459,"I love the thunder cats!! I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it only has one episode instead of two. In this Episode: ""Panthro is spreading destruction across Third Earth. Good ol' Panthro?!? Well, it's not really him... but a deadly clone Mumm-Ra has created. But where's the real McCoy? Trapped in the Bottomless Chasm, Panthro soon has to face ""himself"" in a battle to the death!"" I highly recommend you buy this video and others if you can. They're only out on VHS and are really hard to find.",1054771200,,506,4.451612903225806
7803877,5,6300154459,"This is the episode that is a tale of how wise Jaga helps his loyal ThunderCats find a new home after thier beloved Thundera explodes. This is the first episode in which we meet and become familiar with a great bunch of characters. In this episode, we meet a young boy named Lion-O and he must quickly learn how to become a great leader. You start to feel worried about him because he looses his home, his mentor, {Jaga} and evil Mutants want to destroy him. He has great friends and allies though. Panthro, Tygra, the Wylli Kids, Cheetara, and a loyal nursemaid Snarf will help young Lion-O grow into the Lord of the Thundercats. We also get to see the power of the ""Eye of Thundera"" which is the ThunderCat's power source. Join in the adventures of the Thundercats....
