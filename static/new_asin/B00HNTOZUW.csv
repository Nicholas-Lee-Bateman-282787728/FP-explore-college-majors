8633857,5,B00HNTOZUW,"Poppy Cat Birthday Treasure and Other Adventures is an exciting, funny, and adventurous series of animated films for preschoolers. They are based on the best-selling books by Lara Jones. They have a lot of bright colors and friendly characters throughout the film which will keep kids entertained for a long time.

This DVD is a collection of seven animated films. In the main episode, Poppy Cat is celebrating her birthday. She receives a lot of presents from her friends including a treasure map. Poppy and her friends journey to the Mystery Jungle to find the treasure.

Each episode on this DVD takes you on a different adventure and they all are really cute. The characters are friendly and treat each other nicely, which is good for preschoolers to see.  Each episode only lasts for eleven minutes so it is a good length for young children whose attention span is pretty short. The episodes are full of bright colors that are very appealing and I think young children will really like. The music is very pleasant too. My favorite episode is Marshmallow Mines because one of my favorite characters, Rocket Cat, is in it. Rocket Cat is brave and thankful throughout the episode, which I really appreciate and I know parents will too. Another great thing about this DVD is that it made my imagination fly. I immediately wanted to create boots that had magnets in them so that I could walk on walls, just like Rocket Cat.

What I like best about Poppy Cat Birthday Treasure and Other Adventures is that each episode teaches an important lesson about friendship and teamwork. At the end of each segment, Poppy Cats owner explains the message and gives examples.
I give this DVD 5 out of 5 stars because it is educational, adventurous and funny. I recommend it for kids ages 2 to 5, especially for kids who like animals, music and bright colors.  I think young kids will really enjoy the friendly and silly characters.
