Great show except for the hollywood endings",1252972800,,136,4.074074074074074
3590774,5,B001G0MFKQ,"I don't have time for much tv but nothing keeps me from Criminal Minds.  The character development, the stories, the actors, everything about it is fantastic.
There is graphic and suggestive violence, and some of the subject matter is very disturbing, very disturbing.  Definitely not for children.
This particular season was at the series peak.  I can't wait to buy the season.  For that matter, I am having trouble waiting for the new season to start.  After all,.....dark screen, BANG!",1251849600,4,488,5.05
3590775,5,B001G0MFKQ,"Season 4 was awesome. Can't wait to see on DVD so i can re watch all my favourite episodes... Pact with action, thrilling and team dynamics - I am sure all fans will enjoy deeply... Sept 8 is not soon enough!

Must have for all fans",1251417600,7,232,4.043478260869565
3590776,4,B001G0MFKQ,"Of the four seasons, this season may be the best.  With more dark storylines, the series follow Rossi, Hotchner, Prentiss, Morgan, Reid, Jareau, and Garcia as they deal with the evil side of human nature and more of their own personal stories, connections, and demons.

The fourth season fleshes out these characters and their interdependence on each other.  An excellent team takes time to build and bond.  The season brings this to full circle, especially in the last few episodes where the plots begin to build toward an explosive climax in the season finale.

The promise of new life with Jennifer Jareau's baby boy is a subplot.  As Jareau deals with motherhood, she faces her emotions and fears, especially as she contemplates her child and what the future may hold.

Some of the best episodes are-Minimal Loss with Luke Perry; Instincts and Memoriam which features Dr. Reid's memories of a murder from his childhood, Masterpiece with Jason Alexander,  Soul Mates which gives love your neighbor a sinister twist; Roadkill which is a taut thriller with a surprise; Amplification features an analytical lecture from Reid as he is exposed to a deadly substance; and  To Hell...And Back is the season finale with enough horror, disgust and death for a whole season.  Death takes no holiday in this episode.  Unfortunately, you will never look at that Christmas ham the same way after watching this episode.

This series is for mature minds.  It is definitely not for younger children.",1250812800,39,1486,4.991869918699187
3590777,5,B001G0MFKQ,OMG the Season Four finale was fantastic. I am an absolute avid fan of Criminal Minds. I have Seasons 1-3 on DVD. I can't wait for Season Four to come out. I can't tell you why if you haven't watched this season I don't want to ruin anything for you. I am already excited about Season Five. If you like FBI/Profiler type searies then this one is by far the best and a must have for any serious collector. If you are a new collector or have been living in a cave somewhere and never heard of Criminal Minds please see Seasons 1-3 don't just watch Season Four they must all be watched to fully appreciate the chracters and the plots.,1244246400,30,631,4.223140495867769
3590778,5,B001G0MFKQ,"Criminal Minds is an outstanding TV show, it has a mesmerizing effect on me as a viewer, every season it simply gets better and better, it is brilliantly written, acted and directed.  Can't wait for season 4 to be released on dvd.  This show has a huge fan base down here in Costa Rica, Central America.  Viva Criminal Minds!",1243728000,3,325,4.47457627118644

3590780,5,B001G0MFKQ,"I am an avid watcher and fan of ""Criminal Minds."" The 4th season is phenomenal. Every season I say to myself, ""It can't get any better than this,"" and every season it goes above and beyond the previous one. Hard to believe, but true. The season finale this time was shocking!!!! It is worth it just to get the 4th season to see the final episode!!!",1243209600,16,348,4.287878787878788
3590781,5,B001G0MFKQ,"I am an avid watcher of the Criminal Minds series and I would have to say that this is the best season yet and it isn't even over with.  It is not very often that one can say that every single episode was absolutely amazing.  Although there was one episode which didn't meet up to the standards of the rest.
As for the rest of the season, thanks to amazing writers and directors, this show has managed to show me things I never thought possible.  For example, I am used to seeing James Alexander as creepy, I think that was the whole point of George on Seinfield.  But the character that Jason Alexander played was truly amazing, creepy in just the right way, but truly an unsub worthy of the team.
One shadow I do have about this season was the appearance of the character Jordan.  At her first appearance and initial interaction with Morgan you believe that this character could uphold the standard that J.J., actress A.J. Cook, carries out in her performance.  But sadly after the first spark, her performance is quite a disappoint.  In fact, I usually watched the episode in hopes of avoiding her character all together.  Perphaps I am just to fond of J.J.'s character and thought biasedly at seeing her go.  But I don't doubt the relief I felt as seeing her return.
I can't wait to see the final shows of the season and I already plan on purchasing the DVD when it comes availble.  I hightly recommend it to those looking for intrigue, humor and drama all in one show.",1240963200,59,1473,4.462686567164179

3590850,3,B001G0MFKQ,"Entertaining, yes.  Typical Hollywood BS, yes.  Over all an enjoyable show to watch.  I think one of the main reasons I like it is because there isn't a bunch of nutty stunts every episode.  I mean that is really refreshing when it seems so many shows rely on over the top stunts or plots.  Plus the over all concept pulls you in.  When they focus on this material, it is always more interesting.  As far as my little beefs, they are minor, its just you see them in every episode, so they wear on me.  Garcia is a joke.  What she does is a joke, her character is a joke. And maybe that is the joke?  They should have killed her when they had the chance.  BAU always on they scene when the catch the unsub.  I mean its like the other cops don't even exist.  They always solve the case quickly.  It would be nice, to have a few not get solved.  Finally, four seasons and five team members have been directly involved with the cases.  Its a bit much.  I get why they do these things (except Garcia), but for me, none of them work for how often it happens.

Again, over all entertaining.  Also, I think Thomas Gibson's character is top-notch.  His no nonsense approach is great.  Clearly the strongest one in the group.  Plus he isn't a walking talking cliche like Mark Harmon in NCIS.",1495929600,,1281,4.2719665271966525

3590905,5,B001G0MFKQ,"I have been watching this show since it's beginning and there is absolutely nothing I don't like about it. This arrived nicely packaged and brand new. I have two favs on this show as does my wife. We both like JJ as she is the one that is the spirit of the team. I also like Hotchner as he leads his team by example and stay true to the ideals of the job even though he may be falling apart inside. The show is brilliant as it shows you their emotions as well as their toughness. Even though you know their acting, most of the time they put you right their with them and that to me is more than acting.",1477872000,,602,3.9834710743801653
3590916,3,B001G0MFKQ,"Episode was well done. I watched it because of my interest in Dissociative Identity Disorder as depicted by a character in the episode.
Of course this was just another sensationalized characterization of a victim of a mental illness being criminalized which in reality is rare. The majority of people diagnosed with Dissociative Disorders are victims of crimes and not the perpetrators. How I wish the writers would at least once portray those suffering mental illness as victims they are. Sad and inacurate portrayal, but full of suspense.",1477526400,,540,5.218390804597701

The season was good, and JJ gave birth! Adorable baby and I love that JJ gets more into the family aspect of things and breaks the rules. And Reid gets schooled in how to flirt with girls by Derek! :D",1444780800,,640,3.8931297709923665

3591236,5,B001G0MFKQ,"When there is a serious case involving serial killers, serial rapists, pedophiles and serial child abductors the local authorities call for help. Who do they call, BAU, the behavioral analysis unit of the FBI. They come in, create a profile that leads them to the unknown subject (Unsub) committing the crimes. Season 4, sees some interesting changes. JJ gets pregnant, and a new person temporally takes her place on the team. There is an amazing yet disturbing episode involving a terrorist attack with a particularly deadly form of anthrax. The scariest part or most disturbing, is that this could happen right here in our back yard. If you've seen prior seasons, you might find this season a little less disturbing then past seasons. Either that, or after watching 4 seasons in a row, this stuff is less disturbing to me. Maybe, I have become desensitized to it. Either way, it's a great season, with a lot of plot twists, a lot of action and a great ending to the season 3 cliffhanger. There is a wonderful 2 part episode in which Reed has to reconcile something that happened during with his childhood. Jane Lynch returns as his mother, once again proving what a great actress she really is.

If you are a fan, I highly recommend this season. If not, check it out, you might like it. Though if you are not fan, why are you reading this?

The plots are very real, and giving Grubber freedom to write and direct episodes was a genius move, he is an excellent writer and director.  TOO excellent for me, however.  While I said the plots are excellent and real - they became so real I had to stop watching the series.

3591391,5,B001G0MFKQ,I love Criminal Minds although the situations are sometimes bloody they depict what happens at the scene very well. I like how they can profile the killers too. Also showing the investigators have feelings too makes for a great show.,1389139200,,233,4.85
3591392,5,B001G0MFKQ,"If you like these types of shows anyway, you're in for a bigger treat with Criminal Minds. It's exciting; it's fascinating.

3591432,5,B001G0MFKQ,"As we all know Prentiss comes and goes because of her ""other job"" so we won't see much of her in this season.  J.J. is back in full, thank the Lord, and this pretty much is like all other seasons, excellent.  While there is no real REAPER type character in this season, you get a TON of episodes, far more than 99% of good shows out there (2X-3X the amount of Dexter season episodes) and almost all are well written.

You just have to own all the seasons of this show.  If you like SVU you will realize how much you missed out wasting your time watching that show over this - and I was a SUV addict.  Far better acting, far more interesting shows, but the only downside is the CLEARANCE RATE.

The one thing I have always disliked about Criminal Minds is how many UNSUBS they catch, and quickly.  The odds of solving a homicide are about 60% nationwide.  Additionally, the BAU or BSU of the FBI does not handle half the cases they actually depict here.  Sure they give the obligatory ""we've been invited"" tagline, but most jurisdictions do not want the FBI handling their cases, especially within 24 hours.

""Wheels up in Thirty"" - as a former federal investigator, I can assure you that they do not have a private jet, they fly coach - and cheap.  The FBI does not have a private landing strip for the BAU and to have a plane ready, with pilot and gas at the ready, would be impossible.  At best they arrive next day.  They never show anyone packing, just the stuff on their backs???

But those nit picky things aside, great show and it will me missed when off the air.  The X-Files of the 2000's.",1382400000,,1598,4.315436241610739

At the time of their air date did not really know who he was.  Learned more about him when I became more interested in the show ""Southland"" that he was on.  He is going to be on Criminal Minds again this season, so went back to watch and refresh my memory.  He was also in s5 Faceless/Nameless and 100.  Am now a huge fan of his.

3591559,5,B001G0MFKQ,Great entertainment if you are into the thought processes that could possibly be used by a criminal and how they use crisis or life changing events to change their lives and of course end up making poor choices.

Thisd only measns a matte rof time, and a lot of Unsubs leave snow because of that. The thing is thtat this unsub is not part of the FBI plans and, after the things that happened in the begining, who wants to blame them. Whle - rwally.

I have seen the way love intersects with the jobs and there have been no cases of it contributing to people with passed experience. While this might have bothered others it made hims feel like the people ar eon to something snd the ripper would be. We kno w what that means and then some.

This all has family problems and it makes the family feel like they were out of their element when they played this game. The Ripperis not a plaything, he his someone that is derrange that needs to be caught. It is only a matter of time. Still, he did know something they didn't know - something private. It had to do with how often thos eB.A.U. individuals had to scream in shock.

The one thing out of all of this is the last two seasons, where Hotch finds himself looking into the horrors and where he things he understands. He has two brothers into conflict and those two are not the brightest tools in the shed. Death happens, too, making the people not feel like they could carry one. It is hell when it falls apart and you cannoth answer,

I hate what happens to Hiotch but i know nothing will be the same as well. He is in charage of this and he will want results. This means that the world might not have lost and that the tickets were not cheap. It seemed to be idealic.

Who knows what these people have gotten themsevles into. Please minimize the pain he feels when he casts that line.

I found it exceptionally entertaining. The story plot was exceptional and the acting and drama as well. However several things were disturbing if the series is supposed to convince the average person that a group working in secret and going about investigating people based on profiling are smart enough to do it without public oversight.

1. All the supposedly criminals died so there was never a trial
2. Only the word of the agents was used to explain what happened.
3. They could say anything they wanted regardless whether or not it was true.

From Hill Street Blues, to Law & Order, to NYPD Blue, I've always found them compelling.  Now with influx of CSI and the science driven genre of investigative police work, there is one show that I think stands alone - Criminal Minds.

Any fan of psychological thrillers like the Hannibal Lector movies, Mr. Brooks, or any number of other movies that raise the hair on your neck, will appreciate this series.  Not only does it delve into the minds of the killer to explain how ""monsters"" are created, but also into the minds of the FBI BAU (Behavior Analysis Unit) team members that track them down and bring them to justice.  The series is emotional, personal, and always intriguing in it's exploration into human nature and the goods and evils it is capable of.  Top notch acting and original writing drive this series with excellent performances by Thomas Gibson as SSU Aaron Hotchner ""Hotch"" as the deeply introspective team leader, former soap opera star Shemar Moore, showing surprising range as an actor, as SSU Agent Morgan, and Joe Mantegna as the legendary SSU Agent, Joe Rossi, returning to slay the demons of his past failures.

3591952,4,B001G0MFKQ,"After a riveting cliff hanger for season three, ""Criminal Minds"" returns delivering on what was promised in the 3rd season.

Hotch(Thomas Gibson) and his team tackle a variety of compelling cases including a serial rapist/murderer who mysteriously begins claiming new victims leaving his DNA behind AFTER his death (""Angel Maker"")and Reid (Matthew Gaye Gublur)begins to suspect that his father may have something to do with the unsolved abduction of a boy that he played little leage with years before in Las Vegas.

There have been a number of reviews suggesting that ""Criminal Minds"" became predictable during the 4th season. I'd disagree as I found the writers/producers willing to tackle difficult multi-part stories with unusual twists that were the equal of earlier seasons. Having watched the 4th season randomly with the second and third, I found the quality of the writing/production/acting to be as high as the previous seasons.

I did find the last two episodes of the 4th season to have a great set up but I found it implausable (I don't want to spoil it for you but there were too many inconsistencies. If you PM me I'll gladly discuss them)but the conclusion did set up a nice cliffhanger for season 5 which was nicely resolved. There were a couple of episodes that also left threads hanging (for example ""Demonology"" never properly tied together how the death of a priest in Spain was truly tied into the three deaths in the U.S. unless I missed something)but I suspect it probably had to do with material cut for time constraints (I didn't look at the deleted scene for this episode so perhaps the info is there)and life often has loose ends. The rest of the episodes are taunt, well written and resolve the major issues nicely so one or two stumbles can be forgiven particularly on a show that is this tightly plotted.

The extras include a number of featurettes including ""Working the Scene"" that gives us a lot of behind-the-scenes information on 11 episodes. We also get deleted scenes, profiles and a gag reel. My only other complaint is that this doesn't have subtitles (although it is close captioned so those with devices that can decode the close captioning can enjoy them)for English that you can access while watching the episodes (handy when there are distractions in the background).

3592008,5,B001G0MFKQ,"Criminal Minds - Season 4.

It is fantastic, just like the first 3. I was shocked and upset at the disappearance of Gideon, and im still coming to terms, but even as season 4 started.. Jason who?
The show is brilliant and by far the best crime show around. I have collected plenty of TV series, but this is my favourite by far.",1257033600,,327,4.190476190476191

3592011,5,B001G0MFKQ,"Another fantastic season, JJ has the baby, Hotch is still 'moody' at best, Spencer Reid manages to get an admirer! Storylines are gripping, well filmed and I've found myself staying up later than I should to watch the next exciting episode :o)  Well worth every penny spent.",1256256000,,274,4.829787234042553

3592014,5,B001G0MFKQ,I have all 4 seasons of Criminal Minds Its the best investment that i have done. I enjoy watching the seasons over and over agian with out commercial and the price is less then in the stores. the picture is perfect and so is the sound. Can not go wrong if you purchased this product. Igive it 5 stars for video and sound.,1255305600,,321,4.111111111111111
3592084,5,B001G0MFKQ,"Wonderful show and I am totally hooked. It is the only show we watch as a family and I am thrilled that the FBI actually has profilers to solve crimes. I read ""Mindhunters"" by John Douglas about how the BAU was started and it was fascinating and when you realize that serial killers are expert profilers on their victims, it is wonderful that the good guys turned it around on them.",1255219200,4,382,4.394366197183099
3592085,4,B001G0MFKQ,"In the product description it says it's SUBTITLED. It's not!!! And then you are faced with all this harassment to change the product, and they don't replace it because it's not Amazon's fault but it's a product fault and they only refund it if/when you return it of course! To cut the long story short, the product is in many ways defective if it's not subtitled because if your hearing is impaired or if English is not your primary language ...then you have a problem.

My comment has to do with subtitles only. The stories, as usual, are excellent!",1254960000,,550,4.555555555555555
3592086,5,B001G0MFKQ,"Excellent Season much better with Dave Rossi in it. (joe mantegna)
Enjoyed the fourth Criminal Minds very much.
The Team work much more together as a team should.",1254873600,,162,4.821428571428571
3592087,5,B001G0MFKQ,I absolutely love Criminal Minds.  This is one of the best shows on.  The DVD's for the fourth season came in on the day it came out and got it for a great price.  It was a lot easier getting it from Amazon than to have to go out and get it right now.  Amazon is great for getting these.,1254787200,,287,3.7333333333333334
3592088,5,B001G0MFKQ,"I am addicted to the Criminal Minds series. Love the profiling aspects. Intense characters. Own all 4 seasons and will  probably purchase any further season series as they become available.

I highly recommend this series for anyone who is a puzzle solver.",1254700800,,256,5.071428571428571
3592089,5,B001G0MFKQ,I love this program and see that they come up with new and interesting subjects every week.  The characters are very believable and make the show the success that it is.  Look forward to watching season 5,1254528000,,204,4.486486486486487
3592090,5,B001G0MFKQ,"love to review it , love to see it ,but as it is still making its way to the uk I can't , i think it must be in a boat with a man rowing as it is taking so long, but as i don't want to sound like a moaning brit, and we brits have plenty to moan about, (The pound, Gordon Brown) i will shut up. I am sure when it arrives it will be great, but I am desperate as we missed 2 episodes when we were on holiday in Greece (yes I know i tried to sound hard done by, but we have to get away from UK)",1254528000,,490,3.3839285714285716
3592091,5,B001G0MFKQ,"Criminal minds season 4 has to be the best season yet i don't think that it had a hollywood ending i think that it had a great ending with a surprise twist. i thought they had some really creepy performances from some of tv's best actors--like jason alexander, luke perry, c thomas howell who gave such a brilliant performance as the boston reaper. i hope that the writers of the show continue to have a wonderful story plots. i heard that they are going to do a some great stories like the austalian kidnapping where that girl was in a shelter for years and had the father kids and a rocker who moonlights as a serial killer. so there are some interesting stories to check out for this season. i am very excited about the new season which starts on sept 23-9pm. so i would say buy this dvd set but at a cheap price its a great show but now worth 30 to  50 dollars. wait till you buy  this season at a very cheap price. when you do get it know that its worth it because you will brilliant performances from it cast especially from thomas gibson he was so good this season. you will love the criminals they go after like the boston reaper, the canadian serial killers, you will see bio tech killers, and you will even see cult killers, genius killers, female killers, partners in crime killers, they got it all in this.
so the point i am saying is you will love the show....buy it but wait till it a price you can afford.",1253145600,8,1420,4.2555555555555555
3592092,5,B001G0MFKQ,"Practically hanging to the edge of my seat to see what will happen. Kinda had a sneaking feeling that the season would end as it did but that didn't make me feel any better! Can't wait for Season 5...it is an intelligent show that does not dumb down concepts for their viewers. I love that we get to know each character well but there is definitely still an air of mystery to each of them.  This show is simply amazing. If you haven't started watching it, you really should :)",1253145600,2,476,4.288888888888889
