6445108,5,B00KSEAMT2,"I received this DVD in the mail today September 17, 2014. This DVD s amazing. Anyone interesting in the history of the royal families of Europe will love this DVD. Anyone that loves history will love this DVD. This is a high class documentary. It is a DVD that I can watch many times to absorb all the details. Anyone that likes the history of World War I will love this DVD. This is one of the best documentaries that I have ever seen. I am going to order a second copy of this DVD. I like it that much.",1410912000,32,504,4.05
6445109,5,B00KSEAMT2,"The war is WWI. Though two cousins are shown on the DVD package photo, Tzar Nicholas II and King George V, there are three cousins integral to the story. The third, of course, is Kaiser Wilhelm II of Prussia. His mother, Vicky, was Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, making Wilhelm Victoria's grandson. King George V of England was, of course, Queen Victoria's grandson, and his mother was Princess Alexandra from Denmark. Alexandra's sister, Dagmar, was the mother of Tzar Nicholas II, being the wife of his father Tzar Alexander III.  And Nicholas married Alix, who was also a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, through her 2nd daughter, Alice.

Got that?  The family dynamics were probably no different than many other families, but all was magnified 10,000% because of who they were and the power they wielded. We may have a cousin whom no one really wants to invite to the reunion because he is bombastic and attention-seeking. But we don't have to worry about his country invading our wife's homeland, either, as is what happened to George and Nicholas when Prussia invaded Denmark (while Wilhelm's father was Kaiser).

This documentary is not primarily about WWI itself. There is no description of battles fought, etc. The emphasis of this documentary is the personal. It excellently illustrates ""what'ifs"". War may have seemed unavoidable after Arch Duke Ferdinand was assassinated. But ""what if"" Wilhelm's disability had been accepted and supported by his mother?  ""What if"" Bismark had left Denmark alone, and the two sisters didn't make it their mission to ostracize Prussia in the family. ""What if"" Edward VII (George's father, ""Bertie"", Victoria's son) had not had a surfeit of diplomatic magic - or maybe it's what if Victoria had lived even longer, keeping the family together by force of personality? ""What if"" the tzarevich had not had hemophilia? ""What if"" Nicholas had responded to the bread riots with something other than barbaric force?

And, at the very end, something I had not known about: ""What if"" England had not refused asylum to the last of the Romanovs? This, of course, is after the war is over. But, as I wrote, this is not so much about the specifics of WWI, but of the royal cousins to whom the war belonged, in one way or another. Did you know that Kaiser Wilhelm was exiled to Holland and lived there in luxury for 20 years after losing WWI?

This is a fabulous 2-hour documentary. I was lucky enough to see it in a theater just this afternoon - the BBC is testing sending shows to America to be seen in theaters, generally more ""art"" theaters, and admission was free.

""Royal Cousins at War"" is just one of the shows the BBC produced  to commemorate the centenary of the start of WWI. It originally aired on TV in England in April, 2014, in two parts. ""Royal Cousins at War"" has extraordinary illustrations. They include many photos and early movies, including home movies made by the doomed Romanovs.
[Edited to add:] I now have my 1-disc DVD of ""Royal Cousins at War"". English subtitles are available on both the DVD and BluRay. The show  is presented in 16:9 in stereo. The two episodes total 120 minutes of riveting viewing. There are no DVD/BluRay bonus extras.

Highly recommended!
After you've watched ""Royal Cousins at War"", watch another of BBC's centenary shows, the excellent docu-drama
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/37-Days/dp/B00KSEAMAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">37 Days</a>.
I was fortunate to see this in the theater, too. It has a totally different emphasis, and illustrates the diplomatic machinations that took place in the 37 days between the assassination of ArchDuke Ferdinand and the start of WWI. It is longer, 2 1/2 hours, and riveting, because it brings up a whole different set of ""what ifs"".

6445148,5,B00KSEAMT2,"This documentary really explains the personalities and the families of the royal cousins in the years from 1870-1918.  We see how there interfamily relationships change and evolve. How each leader is the result of their situations as well.  The Kaiser is far more of a intricate personality than one would expect too. He's trying to be ubermacho and yet he's very sensistive and loves jewelry and designing clothes. This doesn't whitewash these men at all. Even King George is rather mundane and not very impressive , but he does what he must mostly in a admirable way.  It's a very detailed 3 hour story here. With lots of good footage and great interviews from several excellent biographers.  We all know the basic story of these people , now you can get a far more in depth view of them.  This doesn't really cover the other royal houses of Europe at the time though , most of them were related to these three cousins.  And The war ended not only the german monarchy, and Russian Monarchies,  but also Austria hungaries,  the Ottoman empires, and others even if some of them fell a few years later .  The war doomed them.  The dvd is from the BBC which has always done excellent historical documentaries and this is no exception. This one moves along very well and is filled with really great insight into the characters involved in this important story.  And the interviews which are done quickly are filled with spot on analyses.  Each interview is done quickly in a minute or so , before we get back to the basic narration of what happened and why.  Which is why these documentaries move so quickly and don't bog down.  This format has been used for quite a while of course. You will learn a lot here and be entertained as well,.",1436054400,,1735,4.572815533980583

6445156,4,B00KSEAMT2,"This is a well produced documentary about the leading royal families in Europe before WWI.  European royalty has been interconnected for many decades.  King George V of England, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.  We learn their back grounds and what happened to make them become the men they were and what lead them to war.  World War one change how royal families functioned in Europe.  The old film footage shown is of good quality.  Various historians add story bits to create whole story and bring the past to life.  I have always enjoyed history and the history of the world wars.  World War one saw the end of the Romanov's, some family members survived, but the end of the Tsar was brutal and bloody.

6445175,5,B00KSEAMT2,This is a remarkable and historic telling of the 2 cousins and the path fate took them to during their time as Royals. Both were not supposed to be the Monarch. They both had older Brothers who both died before they could be made King. This has happened before. King Henry the V111 also was the second son AS was Richard 111. I hate the Welsh Tudors reign which was a long one and dominates English history for their bloody reign and the change from Catholic to Anglican Church. This DVD covers much of the time these 2 men reigned the highs and the lows. At the conclusion of WW1 the world would see new Country Borders. The Hapsburgs of Austria/Hungary would reign no more. This affected their first cousin Keiser Wilhelm who was a complete Nutter. The Balkins split. This showed maps of Europe and I thought that fascinating. If you are interested in History I suggest you add this one to your collection. You can not separate Monarchy with Battle. George V could have saved his Russian Cousins but chose not to with worry the populace would turn against them too.,1419724800,,1067,4.533678756476684

6445188,3,B00KSEAMT2,"Not what I expected.  I thought it would chronicle Nicholas II and George V during World War I.  The program focused heavily on Kaiser Wilhelm, who is not pictured on the front of the case.  Nicholas II was given minimal time, with more focus on his abdication and execution (which has already been covered in a multitude of books, films and dvd's)  than his upbringing and involvement in World War I.  A great deal of time was spent covering these topics on the other two monarchs.",1416441600,8,482,4.558139534883721

The insightful narration and the abundance of rare archival footage and photography are expertly woven together to create a very gripping and extremely interesting BBC documentary. It provides a great education on the family dynamics and dysfunctions of the British, German and Russian monarchies at the time, and how the perfect storm of events came together as The Great War (which laid the foundations for WWII and much of the political instability we see in the world today).",1416096000,4,690,5.06140350877193

6445196,4,B00KSEAMT2,I thought the DVD was very interesting. It is hard to imagine a more dysfunctional family. They all seemed to be very insecure individualls and the Kaiser came across as a childish nitwit. They could have done more to avoid the outbreak of WWI but aside from Nicholas had very little power. It also seemed that Nicholas and George V didn't really want to rule at all. I thought the DVD did a good job at explaining the rivalries of the three royal cousins. However I thought it was a little biased but after all it was from a British point of view. Over all it was jolly good.,1414627200,3,576,4.293577981651376

THE BEGINNING: As this documentary puts it, how did traditional allies Germany and England become estranged with England fighting alongside historical enemy Russia in WWI?  It is one of the great puzzles of the 20th century.  To be fair, this documentary does not lay it all at the feet of the three royal cousins and Queen Victoria (with offspring on the thrones of at least 10 countries in Europe).  However, their part in the affair is the focus of this amazing documentary that begins long before WWI.  You see, Queen Victoria's house is German in origin.  However, Danish princesses (and sisters) Alex and Dagmar marry Queen Victoria's son Bertie and Russian Alexander III respectively.  Queen Victoria's oldest daughter Vicky is already married to Fritz in pre-unified Germany.  These are the three families that produce the main players (and cousins) in our story:

King George V of England --- son of -- Bertie (Edward VII) & Alex
Tsar Nicholas II of Russia --- son of -- Alexander III & Dagmar
Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany --- son of -- Vicky & Fritz

Just one year after the marriage of English Bertie and Danish Alex, the German state of Prussia invaded Denmark, completing the annexation of duchies Schleswig and Holstein.  This while General Bismarck went about unifying all of the German states.  This created a new enmity or distance within the younger members of the royal family between the German branch and the other two with Danish wives, Russia and England.

CREATION OF KAISER WILHELM: As the children grow and family tensions arise, Royals of Europe vacation at a family palace in Denmark.  However, the enmity spawned by the Prussian annexations means the German Royals are not invited and the estrangement continues.  A little back story, young Wilhelm was breach born and his arm deformed in the process.  The show oversimplifies a bit, but Wilhelm's deformity causes disappointment in his mother and a strained relationship.  Perhaps in response, Wilhelm develops a childish, petulant, garish personality with some truly disturbing Freudian overtones.  These personality flaws make him less than popular, all politics aside.  As the other families grow close, Wilhelm is left out.  This is just a hint of things to come and the show demonstrates how these rivalries and motivations continue into adulthood.

I really enjoyed the background of the two Danish princesses, particularly Alex who was the ""Dianna"" of her day.  The documentary does explain that public sentiment was changing in England at the time (against Germany) and that rivalries in the Royal family itself could not have caused WWI on their own.  But it's only a slight mention.  The movie footage and photos of the royal families playing together were amazing.  It was incredible to see Tsar Nicholas' family moving and breathing, a sad shaft of light in a cloud of things soon to come.  Queen Victoria comes across a bit angry as they mainly quote her railing to her children against Russia, reminding them they ARE German! The narration can be a little unpolished compared to the glitz of some new documentary styles, but that's just fine.  There was one secondary narrator or historian that I found a little annoying.  These are small nitpicks in a production that really is extraordinary and well worth owning.  One of my favorites!",1414108800,42,3840,5.25615763546798

6445204,5,B00KSEAMT2,"As someone who is totally fascinated with both European history and royalty, I was completely absorbed by this BBC documentary that looks at the intersection of family dynamics among royals before and during World War I. Don't expect any gruesome battle scenes. Instead, this is an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at the impact family relationships (with rivalries and personality conflicts) had on world politics, simply because this family was royal.

In this two-part, two-hour documentary, rich with historical footage and private family photos I'd never seen, I got a much clearer understanding of how personal relations among Queen Victoria's grandchildren figured into the lead-up to World War I. Czar Nicolas II of Russia, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and King George V of England were first cousins with complex relationships that shifted over the decades. Their individual beliefs about and commitment to the power of monarchy played a significant role in the events that led to The Great War. And by watching this documentary, you will get a better understanding of why George V was the only one to keep his throne when World War I ended.

Here's an intro to the relationships.
 England's Queen Victoria > mother to Princess Victoria ""Vicky"" (who marries heir to German Empire) > becomes mother of Kaiser Wilhelm II
 England's Queen Victoria > mother to King Edward VII > father to King George V
 England's Queen Victoria > mother to Princess Alice, who marries Prince Louis of Hesse > mother to Princess Alexandra, who becomes wife to Tsar Nicholas II
 Danish King Christian IV > father to Princess Alexandra, who becomes wife to King Edward VII > mother of King George V
 Danish King Christian IV > father to Princess Dagmar, who becomes wife to Tsar Alexander III > mother of Tsar Nicholas II",1414108800,60,1808,5.026755852842809

The entangling alliances and spread of international rivalries caused by long simmering personal conflicts, leader after leader sharing family connections through the United Kingdom's Queen Victoria, wound up tearing apart the lives of millions. This fascinating documentary takes a detailed look at the complex, often contradictory lives of Europe's royal families up to and during the war.

It's hard to deny how much family squabbling wound up making things far, far worse than they'd otherwise have been, even with the jockeying for political power typical of the age. The only real flaw is that the film focuses a great deal on the psychoanalysis of various figures, particularly that of the partially disabled Kaiser and his issues, to the expense of looking at other factors. On the whole, though, the movie's still well worth watching.",1528502400,,933,5.22
