8381331,5,B002UNMWTM,"This 20/20 special, which aired the night that Farrah Fawcett passed away is definitely a must-have for life long fans and those who are interested in an overview of her rise to superstardom and her brave final days fighting for her life.  Barbara Walters flew to Los Angeles the week before Fawcett succumbed to cancer to interview longtime love Ryan O'Neal, fellow ""Angel"" and lifelong friend Jaclyn Smith, ""Charlie's Angels"" co-creator Leonard Goldberg, Hollywood hairstylist Jose Eber, best friend Alana Stewart and Fawcett's primary physician in Los Angeles, Dr. Laurence Piro.  Each interview is personal, revealing, and sometimes quite emotional (particularly O'Neal and Smith).  Along with these interviews, Barbara also looks back at two original interviews she had with Fawcett in 1980 and 1984.  There is a striking difference in Farrah during this 4 year span.  A bit nervous and unsure of herself in the 1980 talk, she is very calm, confident and self assured during the 1984 chat (she was also 6 months pregnant with Redmond at this time).  Some have questioned Ryan's love and intentions regarding Farrah's passing, and have accused Alana of ""cashing in"" on her much more famous friend.  I don't know how I feel.  Ryan obviously loves the attention and is, after all, an actor who adores the spotlight.  I do believe he loved Farrah dearly.  Their 30 year affair proves that.  If Alana is cashing in on Farrah's battle (she also wrote a book which I enjoyed), I am thankful to her for being there for Farrah and providing us with the moving documentary ""Farrah's Story"" which she was instrumental in the filming of).  Once again, this is the most moving tribute I have found (on dvd) of Farrah Fawcett and I will view it often when I think of her.",1262995200,10,1762,4.895622895622895
