7282232,5,B00ZGPZDLU,"This review is for the double bill BBC set.

The five star rating is strictly for the second DVD on the set: Fleming The Man Who Would Be Bond, as riveting and as slick and fun as any 007 feature youve ever enjoyed.

 The first DVD, Copenhagen, (cashing in on David Craigs present box office allure) is based on a stage play of ideas that should have stayed a play. As a film, Im afraid this gabby bore about which side was developing the A-Bomb in WWII left me cold. Wonderful acting, and commendable intentions, but as a film its a snoozer from beginning to end. Its interesting only to watch Craig prove his serious side besides his physique and charisma. This first DVD I would rate with only 2 stars, as in E for Effort.

Instead,  I recommend you buy this set just for the second feature about Ian Fleming. You won't regret it. This  real movie has great production vales, wonderful locales, lots of suspense and adventure, and Dominic Cooper makes a very dashing and believable Fleming. It should have been released by itself, but then I guess not everyone is familiar with the leading actor - a pity.",1451088000,11,1108,4.487562189054726
7282233,3,B00ZGPZDLU,Tedious. Three person plays adapted to the screen often need more characters to be believable. No servants in this big house (not believable). The movie version of Equus bored me also. Beautifual acted and filmed.,1450915200,2,213,5.114285714285714

7282235,4,B00ZGPZDLU,"Good films overall. Entertaining.
Fleming film tends to focus on his gratuitous sex life and drinking. It was historically inaccurate at times.
Copenhagen is based on Tony award winning play and examines the wartime meeting of Niels Bohr and German atomic physist Werner Heisenberg in 1941. It is a dramatic recreation of this meeting and stars current Bond  007 Daniel Craig as Heisenberg. The film discusses the German atomic weapons project during the Second World War and speculates what might have been revealed to Bohr about it at this meeting.",1447718400,11,550,5.111111111111111

7282243,5,B00ZGPZDLU,"You wouldn't think that the ghosts of two world famous physicists, with a wife along to kibitz and add perspective, would be anything but a snooze fest. But Copenhagen looks back at a mysterious and well known incident from World War II. Former friends and colleagues, Niles Bohr, a Dane, and Werner Heisenberg, a German, who had worked together to create the entire field of quantum mechanics some decades before, come together at Bohr's home in conquered Denmark for reasons still not completely clear. And what happened at that meeting has become a legendary mystery in the scientific world. Was Heisenberg trying to pick Bohr's brain for secrets that would help Germany create an atomic bomb? Or was it to explain his efforts to prevent that effort.

Although it requires strict attention, as significant concepts get presented rapidly and in some volume, it is underneath a deeply human story, about relationships and the distance that must always exist between individuals, no matter how close.

And, of course, the entire cast (all three of them) are superb. If nothing else it proves Daniel Craig is one heck of an actor.

Plus it will make you sound really smart when you start explaining it to your friends.

Trust me.",1462492800,6,1228,4.917874396135265

7282245,5,B00ZGPZDLU,"There is a very simple question. Did Heisenberg save the West through denying Hitler the atomic bomb? Or was it simply because he made a calculation error? The usual answer is that his math was wrong and he thought you needed more Uranium than could be produced. This script poses the more reasonable hypothesis that Heisenberg, one of the greatest physicists that ever lived, knew and refused to let it happen. But,
his contemporaries, Bohr, Oppenheimer, etc. did produce the atomic bomb and unleashed hell upon humanity.  The logic is slowly and carefully presented to Bohr for his judgement of an anguished Heisenberg (Daniel Craig) following the end of World War II.  And furthermore, the story is
based on an actual meeting between Heisenberg and Bohr.  Is it correct? We will never know. But, Heisenberg was denied the Nobel Prize that was his due for his critical contribution to modern particle physics because he was judged to be a collaborator for the Nazis.

After watching the intellectual masterpiece of Copenhagen, Fleming comes off very badly. I stopped watching the movie in disgust. Maybe if
it were watched on its own merits.  But, why watch it when you can go back and listen to Craig's bravura performance in Copenhagen.?",1458950400,12,1241,4.947115384615385

8720252,3,B00ZGPZDLU,"Warning:  don't confuse this movie with the romantic comedy which is also called ""Copenhagen.""

Copenhagen:  2 Stars.  Pretentious, frustrating, and boring.  20 minutes of story/plot stretched into 90 minutes by repeating what happened & who said what only to ultimately arrive at an inconclusive mystery of Heisenberg's version versus Bohr's version of their meeting in September 1941 in NAZI-occupied Copenhagen, Denmark.

The movie is obviously an adaptation of a play which rarely works except for some Shakespeare because plays are so artificial.

It seems obvious to me that the play was meant to make the audience justify having been bored for 70 of 90 minutes (and probably spent a small fortune on tickets) by making them feel they had learned something highly intelligent about the usually incomprehensible quantum mechanics and nuclear physics.  Instead, the audience just learned a little more about the relationship between Bohr, the mentor, and Heisenberg, the disciple, and how WWII got in the way of that collaboration.

Great acting by Daniel Craig, Stephen Rhea, and Francesca Annis.  Being dazzled by the actors soon wears off -- I just wanted them to do something interesting & wondered when this would ever end.

Documentary:  4 Stars.  I found the included documentary about Heisenberg & Bohr to be be far more interesting & enlightening than the movie.

Fleming:  The Man who would be James Bond.  4.5 Stars.  Enlivening & Invigorating Journey through the highlights of Ian Fleming's life between 1938 and 1952:  his forays in Austria with his already famous writer brother before WWII, London before & during WWII failing at being a stockbroker then succeeding at Naval Intelligence, a glimpse at his vices including womanizing & being reckless, then writing Casino Royale in Jamaica.

The movie led me to believe that Ian Fleming's family consisted only of him, his brother, and their dragon lady mother with a passing reference of an illegitimate daughter their mother had though she was a widow.  In reality there were also two younger brothers, including one who died in 1940.  Also, while in this movie Ian Fleming does smoke & drink alcohol, I wouldn't characterize it as ""heavy,"" certainly not to the point that it eventually killed him in the 1960s.  Maybe that would have made this Ian a less beguiling rake.",1497225600,5,2341,5.121372031662269
