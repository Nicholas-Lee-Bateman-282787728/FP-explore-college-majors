3682818,5,B001LAGDJ0,This is a great deal on 2 great movies.  If you buy this combo from a Best Buy you will be paying $34.99 and only available online.  Two great classic comedies for a low price!,1231891200,3,176,4.0

8317757,4,B001LAGDJ0,"John Landis collaboration with Eddie Murphy resulted in these two movies which are gathered in a single Blu-Ray release, They are both worth it for anyone who has not, by any chance, seen them. They are not masterpieces, mind you, but they hold very well as comedies whose focus in centred on social issues. In my opinion, I like Trading Places best, and Aykroyd and Jamie Curtis, not Murphy, steal the show with a well balanced interpretation of their roles.",1346544000,,459,4.75
8317758,5,B001LAGDJ0,"What a perfect combo Blu. I would have to say that time has not been kind to these films but the transfer is overall god. The picture quality is so good in fact that when you see Zamunda for the first time you will notice that everyone is a fake painting in front of a fake painted wall. I guess that is the price we pay for advanced technology placated on older films that were at the height of their quality when made. As for Trading Places, I love that movie and it is a true classic that can be enjoyed no matter how perfect or not perfect the transfer is.",1330387200,,560,4.054054054054054
8317759,5,B001LAGDJ0,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.

Both movies have a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, and last just under 2 hours.  I watched ""Coming to America"" first, and thought the video quality was very good to great - about 8.8 - 9.0 on a 10.0 scale.  I watched ""Trading Places"" immedidately following, and thought the video quality was slightly better - about 9.0 - 9.2 (even though there was distortion in a close up scene looking up at the World Trade Center twin towers).

Both movies are very entertaining.  This was a very worthwhile Blu-Ray purchase.",1325030400,2,631,4.63963963963964
8317760,5,B001LAGDJ0,I was looking for this in BD format and Amazon had it in a combo pack. Great flick. Great Deal. Definitely what i was looking for.,1318032000,,130,4.038461538461538
8317761,4,B001LAGDJ0,"I was really surprised by the superb video quality of these 2 movies on bluray. Clarity and colors get a huge boost compared to the old DVDs. Granted it will never equal the glossy transfers of newer films on bluray but taking into account these films were from the 80s, these are the best they will ever get to look for quite some time to come. And the nude scene of Jamie Lee Curtis in her prime in total HD glory---worth every cent I paid.;)",1304553600,3,444,4.235294117647059
8317762,4,B001LAGDJ0,these are two classic movies that i wanted and for the price for blu-ray it was perfect. dvd's works great. Coming to america dvd was rattling around in the case before i opened it which sucks but dvd works perfect no issues. classic movies  a must have,1297987200,,253,4.382978723404255
8317763,5,B001LAGDJ0,"I just picked this up at Best Buy on sale for $12.99 reduced from $16.99-with tax it came to $7 each bluray, last one they had too. What a deal on two great movies-absolutely Eddie Murphys 2 best movies!.",1296172800,2,204,4.256410256410256
8317764,5,B001LAGDJ0,Shipment was timely and outstanding. It is great to have this method to purchase Blue ray DVDs and books.,1278892800,,105,4.578947368421052
8317765,5,B001LAGDJ0,"This is a fantastic deal on these two Bluray discs.  You'll save a bundle (currently about $15 as of 1-24-09) compared to buying them individually.

I'm not going to review the movies themselves; however, I will tell you that as of today (1-24-09), Amazon's technical details for this two-pack are incorrect.  The aspect ratio is incorrectly listed as 1.33:1.  Those of us geeky enough to care about aspect ratios know that Blu-ray does not release 1.33:1 (or ""pan-and-scan"") movies, unless this was their original release format.  Luckily both of these movies are presented in 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  This is truly a double-pack of each individual Blu-ray movie.

If you're interested in the extras or the visual aspects of the Blu-ray editions, go ahead and check out the individual reviews for each disc.  I just wanted to clarify what this double-pack is...as Amazon's poor description led me to purchase it only when I found it at a local brick & mortar (to double check it).",1232755200,11,978,4.920731707317073
