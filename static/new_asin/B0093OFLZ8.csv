5256363,2,B0093OFLZ8,"Bad acting but I gave it a chance and watched all the way through for possible good skating. It did not improve. Main actor couldn't skate or act, you would think there's a skater out there to cast that can also act.",1467676800,,216,4.166666666666667
5256364,5,B0093OFLZ8,Liked this one. The sport of skateboarding was entertaining and the acting was much better than most made for TV movies. I have watched this two times and enjoyed it more the second time. Recommend to young adults also.,1467676800,,219,4.641025641025641
5256365,5,B0093OFLZ8,Great inspirational movie. I'd like to see more movies like this.,1467590400,,65,5.0
5256366,1,B0093OFLZ8,"The general synopsis for the story is great, Caleb and his parents are great actors, and the camera used for filming is of great quality. With that said, everything else about this movie was terrible. I haven't watched a movie juggle so many things around at once, leaving so many plot holes in its wake it will make you want to wince until I watched this one. One minute Caleb's father is dating a young girl, but too busy for her, the next Caleb's mother is the love of his life (which we never see an interaction between the two). One minute Caleb's father has fired his right hand man, the next he's standing in his office ready for a meeting - his return being very briefly mentioned. Caleb doesn't seem to know people - such as a homeless man - the next he knows him by name. Same thing seems to happen with the guy who is a stalker he doesn't seem to know, but somehow this guy gets Caleb's number? And this movie seems to push religion even more than it pushes the idea of family, which doesn't help its case. The list goes on and seems endless. Same main three actors, same idea for the story, same camera, but change everything else? A potential five star movie.",1466985600,,1172,4.331818181818182
5256367,5,B0093OFLZ8,Very good movie. Love how the homeless man was a big part of it and his message! Didn't like how mean the son was to his mother and very sad he caused her coma.,1466899200,,160,3.735294117647059

5256382,2,B0093OFLZ8,"Bleh... it's ok. If you like skateboarding, you may like it. Seems the story is more about how much anger he has about his father leaving he and his mom when he was younger.",1465776000,,173,4.117647058823529

5256385,4,B0093OFLZ8,"Good family movie, somewhat sad but has a great ending.  Mom has raised her son alone and the movie starts as he is a rebellious, spoiled teenager.  She is very ill with a terminal illness but he doesn't realize how sick she is or what a terrific mother he has been blessed with.  He is an excellent skate boarder and wants to make it into a career so, unbeknownst to his mother, he has been just putting his college applications in a drawer.  When his mother passes away he finds a small box of letters in her closet that show his father's address.  His father is super rich and super shallow.  The son visits him and discovers this and doesn't want anything to do with him but doesn't know how to live on his own in his mother's house.  His father gets him out of trouble and eventually saves his life when he intentionally over doses.  Its at that point that the father wakes up to what is really important in life.  I'll let you watch it to see what happens in the end.",1465344000,,973,4.244565217391305

5256416,4,B0093OFLZ8,"It's a really good movie with lessons on forgiveness.  I will probably watch it again.  However, I picked up this movie because Rosanna Arquette is on the cover.  She really isn't in much of it.",1454112000,,194,4.485714285714286

5256422,3,B0093OFLZ8,"Not a bad movie, just not great.  Lots of dramatic scenes throughout the movie where acting seemed straight out of a high school play - lines read with over-played expressions and body movements.",1451865600,,195,4.909090909090909
5256423,4,B0093OFLZ8,"Good positive movie with a clear message of the gospel in a subtle, not ""preachy"" way. It deals with real issues like death, absent father, suicide, alcohol an drug use so perhaps not suitable for young children. Skateboarding was good and suited the plot. If you're looking for a movie about skateboarding solely, there are probably more advanced You-Tubes to watch, but that's not the point. The movie ends without specific resolutions, but the future is clearly implied by the action so it isn't necessary for everything to be stated point blank. A feel good movie without candy coating. The acting was good and flowed smoothly. I'm not sure what some mean by the sound situation needing adjusting - I never had trouble with it myself.",1449273600,,738,4.865079365079365
5256424,5,B0093OFLZ8,"Other than the fact that I thought he was going to do a backflip on his skateboard at some point, I really enjoyed this movie!  This movie realistically portrayed some of the difficult moments in life - illness, broken promises, broken dreams, death, suicide, drugs/addiction, workaholism, loneliness, etc. and managed to make it clear that all these things can pass away and new life still emerge through the power of forgiveness and faith.  The acting was also very good for all of the main characters.  Well worth my time.",1448668800,,525,4.876404494382022

5256427,5,B0093OFLZ8,"Really great movie.  It had moments of both tears and joy.  I liked that the message of God and faith was woven into the story-but not overly done at all.  It took a while for me to even realize this was a faith based movie, but it was clear in the end.  The acting was decent and the story line was believable.  As a former skater (in my younger years) I also liked the action of seeing the skating scenes.  I do wish the ending would have been more concrete and seeing the relationship between Caleb and his father grow- but overall a great movie for family entertainment.",1447027200,2,574,4.268518518518518

5256434,5,B0093OFLZ8,"Great inspirational film about family and abandonment. The main character struggles with faith, abandonment and anger with his mother.

5256435,5,B0093OFLZ8,"Hardflip is a very inspirational movie. It shows you that even in the darkest of times someone is watching out for you. The distances between relatives can be broken and fragmented but with forgiveness and God in the equation, love wins.",1436313600,,237,4.804878048780488

5256440,2,B0093OFLZ8,"A poorly done movie.  It was slow moving and the plot was boring until near the end, which was better.
Whenever the skateboarding started, which was most of the film, annoying rhythm/noise was used--no music in the background.
The skateboard scenes became tiring to watch.  I had to fast forward the dvd to get through them.
The ending was touching, but the rest of the film is not worth seeing.",1424390400,,395,4.628571428571429

I especially liked the whole story of not knowing your real father plot. I liked it when men aren't afraid of crying. After all, crying relieves emotional pain. Like the good Lord says ""For when I am weak, then I am strong"" 2 Corinthians 12:10 and God does not lie because He's perfect.",1410739200,,445,4.186046511627907

5256463,2,B0093OFLZ8,"I loved To Save A Life.
I hated this movie.

It just didn't make sense. At all. In the beginning, the film doesn't give enough of a sense of how desperate the Caleb's situation is, how his life ""sucks""... he lives in a nice apartment/area, he smokes pot like every other teen, his mom overworks and drinks. So? Give me some more grit that will excuse his completely unlikeable character, build some more emotional or situational stress. The movie doesn't show enough redeeming qualities for us to buy into this kid for feature length movie. Only later, as the plot moves on, I could accept acting out then...

Plus this skate crew is complete BS. All I can do is laugh at them. Is this supposed to be the Fast and Furious of skateboarding? There isn't any bite behind their threats.

This movie just jumps from scene to scene. ""How did we get here so abruptly?""

And maybe this movie is intentionally vague, not giving us the specific location of the area. It doesn't work for me. I don't feel grounded. Just make up a city name or county if you have to!

Dialogue sucks. There are three moments I do like. Homeless, hamburger, and the doctor at the house.

This mnovie doesn't do enough showing. Too much telling. And certain scenes just aren't rational... just don't make sense.

I still don't understand Afable's character (Joey) in this movie. Too weakly developed.

Anyway. This review sucks. But I am so disappointed by this movie. I was hoping for another one to show my youth group, but I can't subject them to this.

And skatedown.... sounds lame. I do like most of the skate scenes. But storytelling, script -- those should have been prioritized.

But I can't completely throw this movie away, because there are a few (very few) good scenes.",1370131200,2,1751,4.619354838709677
5256464,5,B0093OFLZ8,"If your a John Schneider fan than you'll love this DVD

5256465,2,B0093OFLZ8,"This movie could have been wonderful if it would have tied off loose ends. Add an extra ten minutes to the movie and show a resolve to the issues please! Well, too late, this movie is an hour and about 50 minutes and does not end with a very great tie over. Why?

#1- Did the son ever forgive the father? it doesn't show
#2- Did the father ever drop his girlfriend, or did she drop him?
#3- Did the young asian boy ever stand up and get away from the bully that always wanted to compete with the main character?
#4- Did the main character ever get accepted into college, as was his mother's wish?
#5- Did the boy ever get the skating scholarship that kept being brought up?
#6- Did the homeless man ever forgive himself and start picking up the pieces of his life again?

These are some of the main things that were acted out in the movie, but no sufficient ending to tie up the loose ends. I am sorry, i have to give it a two for that reason. And more reasonable sites like Netflix, and Imdb actually give it a two out of five due to poor execution.

Not to mention, you have to modulate the sound the whole movie. Unless you like loud rock music, it is too loud when the background music (not really back ground) comes on, and then too low when the vocals of the actors in the movie come in....",1364083200,15,1296,4.134920634920635

5256470,4,B0093OFLZ8,"If you're into the skateboarding scene, you might be in for a treat here. Or you might be in for a laugh fest, if the movie failed to portray the world of skateboards realistically. Since I grew up in the era of roller skates, the ones with the keys to tighten the skates down over the shoes, I have no knowledge of boarding and I'll just give the benefit of the doubt to the director/writers here. John Schneider, who seems to be getting typecast as a father figure for hurting young people does his usual stellar job. Randy Wayne is excellent as the troubled, but very likeable, skateboarder. Baby faced Wayne is still playing kid's roles even though he will turn 32 this year. The conflict in this film was fairly intense, keeping the viewer's interest, even for non-skateboarding fans to see this through to the climax. My main issue, which prevented me from assigning five stars, is that the message of Christianity was a bit watered down, potentially leading some to believe all we have to do is ride a skateboard that has the name or picture of Jesus on it and our ride through life will be a victorious one. All this movie needed to earn that fifth star was a hint of a follow up conversation that would take place after the competition where the message that Jesus asked us to take up our crosses, not our skateboards, would be shared with the boy.",1357776000,8,1357,4.497975708502024

Highly recommended.",1357257600,,353,5.418181818181818
5256472,4,B0093OFLZ8,"I received this film prior to its release to review from the vendor.
This film follows a young character as he seeks to find who he is.
Skate boarding is where he finds his relief, yet his mother wants to see him 'do something with his life'.

His mother, while preaching at him on one side, is an alcoholic and can't hardly pay the bills.
To top it all off our main character has never met nor knows who his father is.

Through an accident he finds information on his father and this begins the crux of the film.
A Rich father, a poor mother, one who wants him, another who never cared.

This story is great for teens and adults.
To me the key characters voice and the scripting he was given were not 'true to the character' yet even though they are slightly off it doesn't remove the message or distract from the film.",1356912000,4,820,4.243589743589744

Above all the one lesson I learned is that holding grudges against someone isn't worth it, because resentment often causes anger. Anger in turn triggers the adrenaline that causes us to lose the concentration we require in order to pursue our goals and dreams. Likewise in this story Caleb learns how to overcome all of his obstacles that prevent him from becoming a sponsored skater through the simple act of forgiveness.",1353628800,3,519,5.046511627906977
