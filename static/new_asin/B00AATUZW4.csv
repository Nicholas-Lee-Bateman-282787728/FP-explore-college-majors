5407797,5,B00AATUZW4,"The film industry today is absolutely exploding with homages to the storied tradition of grindhouse cinema. Grindhouse cinema, a tradition focusing on sleazy, exploitative films with low-budget production values, gritty visual styles, and tendencies towards camp, schlock, gore, and sexual imagery that often borders on pornography, has a universal appeal towards the prurient interest which has been tapped into in increasing volumes over recent years, spurred on by releases such as the Tarantino/Rodriguez anthology film, appropriately titled ""Grindhouse."" Since then, films such as Father's Day, The Taint and now, Doomsday County, have capitalized on this revived interest in low-budget exploitation films to great success.

Doomsday County, a film directed by Art Brainard, Shawn Haran, Joe Badiali and Steven Shea, and released by Troma Entertainment in 2012, is yet another in a current rash of fairly excellent modern grindhouse films. It concerns a town overrun by zombies, vampires and aliens, and the effort of a few sane people to try and maintain order amongst all the chaos. It's every bit as campy as it sounds, and barring a few minor flaws (occasional technical issues mostly, including less-than-ideal sound production and the obvious downfalls of shooting on a shoestring budget,) it's a whole lot of fun. It has an appealing look and feel, updating the aesthetic of classic grindhouse films with sharp production and plenty of  modern touches that, still, never feel too slick. It has some great practical effects, and is an excellent addition to the modern trend of grindhouse revivalism.

It would be enough if the feature itself was merely this entertaining, but in addition to that the release also has a high volume of very entertaining special features. Amongst these are several trailers for films by the creators of Doomsday County (three in total, not including the trailer for Doomsday County itself,) a handful of Troma-related extras, and outtakes from the feature. The quality of this extra content is high, and the special features, along with the main film, are more than enough to make this one worth a purchase. In addition, the release is very polished overall--the menus are clean and well put together, the box art is appealing, and everything fits together very well. Troma has gone above and beyond on this release and should be commended for its high quality.

In conclusion, Doomsday County is a better-than-average exercise in grindhouse revivalism that plays with the tropes of several genres, deconstructing and reinventing them along the way. It is fun, funny, fast-paced and consistently easy to watch, and it comes packaged with a good amount of high-quality special features that really make this release a valuable addition to any film buff's collection.",1372809600,6,2807,5.301123595505618

5407799,5,B00AATUZW4,"I am proud to say that I have seen this wonderful gem of a film. Four stories in one all centered around a tiny area called Doomsday County, this movie throws punches and takes no names. If you are a fan of fun and love Troma, I highly suggest you enjoy this with a big bowl of popcorn and some Woodchuck ciders with a green apple Twizzler as the straw. You'll laugh. You just might cry. A good time is sure to be had by seeing this movie. But beware; if you are prone to fun-times induced heart attacks or good-times abdominale cramps, then you are in trouble my friend.

In six words: Let's party with John Archer Lundgren.",1359763200,4,625,4.2521008403361344
