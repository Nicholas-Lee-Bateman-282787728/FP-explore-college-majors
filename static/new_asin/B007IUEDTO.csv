5089774,5,B007IUEDTO,"This is the second season of the PBS  ""genealogy"" series ""executive produced"" by actress Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.. I reviewed the first season here on Amazon when it was released. This second season is similar to the first  (which was titled ""Faces of America"")- but with a different array of celebrities searching for their ancestry.

Like all reality TV shows, once one becomes a hit there are copycat shows. I'm not sure which came first (and it really doesn't matter) but there is a similar show that aired on NBC titled ""Who Do You Think You Are?"". I've been watching both second season DVDs and enjoying both. I thought I'd point out the differences in both of my reviews.

Since ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" (WDYTYA) is on a commercial network, it obviously had commercials. With those deleted for the DVD, each episode runs only 42 minutes. And, because the producers want you to remember what happened before each commercial break (short-term memory loss? <g>), they rehash what came earlier after each of the six commercial breaks. As you will see by other reviews of both seasons, this is the biggest gripe both others and myself have with this series. The PBS series have no commercials so each episode is 58 minutes long with no breaks.

While the NBC show used it's funder, the commercial website Ancestry.com, to start the research and the celebrity not only does the research - with some guidance - but travels the country, and the globe, to visit the sites where their ancestors lived, Gates uses outside researchers to do the leg work and compiles the results into an ""album: which he reviews with the celebrity subject. And Gates uses DNA, as well as documentary files and census records to search the heredity trail.

The NBC series focuses on one individual for each episode. Gates takes a different tactic and groups two or three celebrities in each episode. I actually like that idea best. My favorite episode the one where two young New Orleans musicians (Branford Maraslis and Harry Connick Jr - who grew up as friends together in the multi-ethnic neighborhoods of NOLa) discover how their ""roots"" crossed. The other was the episode on husband-wife actors Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgewick. Having known Bacon's family in Philadelphia where he was raised, I found this one of particular interest. You, of course, will find your own.

Other reviewers have listed the celebrities covered in this season and so there is no reason to repeat those here.

Because these are exactly as shown on PBS, you will be subject to the ""supporter commercials"" at the beginning and the end of each episode, but that's a minor inconvenience.

Both series are interesting and take different approaches. And, while the concept of researching your family history may be sparked by watching theses series, a lot has to do with the ""celebrity-ness"" of the stories.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5089775,4,B007IUEDTO,"Ostensibly a continuation to his 2010 series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Faces-of-America/dp/B0033XUH9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Faces of America</a>&nbsp;Dr. Gates continues to serve up genealogies on fairly well known individuals whose family histories more often then not are fascinating and captivating.  It's all quite enjoyable and makes for great storytelling, but as a genealogist myself I can't help but wish Dr. Gates would show the actual effort that goes on behind the scenes to create these family histories.  I'm certain he must have quite a retinue of researchers working diligently to find all of this information as surely a tremendous amount of effort must go into gathering all of this information.  I likewise can't help but wonder what if he has an individual whose family history is rather dull and unexciting?  Are they cut?  Does he just go with different family branches until he finds something dishy?  These are never really answered and I really wish he would do a behind the scenes episode to show how hard genealogists have to work to find this sort of information.  That's minor quibbling however as the family histories Dr. Gates selected genuinely help tell the story of not only that individual but of our nation's collective history, researching a broad array of people representative of who we are as Americans.  The result is endlessly fascinating.

Certain stories certainly pop more than others and I was particularly taken by the story of Angela Warnick Buchdahl on episode 5.  Even though I'm neither Korean nor Jewish I found her own story absolutely fascinating not to mention her truly unique heritage and she's a person I'm truly interested in learning more about.  As a southerner I was also intrigued by episode 7 with Samuel Jackson, Condoleeza Rice and Ruth Simmons, and again it was so interesting to hear how the Civil Rights era had impacted them and spurred them to reach to heights unimagined by their parents and grandparents.  The use of DNA to trace their ancestry was also quite fascinating as it gave glimpses of where in Africa their ancestors came from.  Granted this is used in every episode and the use of DNA not only answers some questions but raises other questions that simply cannot be answered; something I delight in seeing as it points out what genealogists frequently run into.  Episode 8 was particularly stunning as I was amazed at the depth of record keeping in both India and Korea as records went back hundreds and hundreds of years.  I was also struck by how haphazardly records are stored and am praying that they have been digitized although I have my doubts.  My personal favorite was episode 9 with comedienne Wanda Sykes as she is not only so funny, but her family's history is simply astonishing.  I don't want to spoil it for those interested in watching, but suffice to say your jaw will drop when you hear certain aspects of her family's history as it truly tells things about our country's history that you simply will NOT learn from textbooks.

There certainly will be some who do not like Dr. Gates or who will critique seemingly everything he does.  I found the multiculturalism throughout the series to be  refreshing and certainly many people in the series found some surprising results during the DNA section that they didn't expect, pointing out how we truly are a melting pot of peoples.  The DNA testing adds a fascinating new aspect to traditional genealogical research that should be utilized as a tool by researchers.  Granted it cannot answer some questions and may raise new ones that similarly cannot be answered.  In the whole ""Finding Your Roots"" is fascinating television even for those not interested in genealogy and family history.  Like another series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sarah-Jessica-Parker/dp/B003B2VRJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sarah Jessica Parker</a>&nbsp;it does have a tendency to focus on famous people over average people so as to draw in viewers.  Unfortunately some of those viewers may be lulled into thinking genealogical research is easy and when confronted with the reality of it will drop it like a bad habit.  That would be a shame and in that respect I think shows of this nature can do the genealogical community a disservice even as it brings in new interest.",1342915200,9,4396,5.235378031383737

5089803,4,B007IUEDTO,"I've spent the last two months watching episodes of Who Do You Think You Are?, so when I heard there was another genealogical series put out by PBS, I wanted to give it a try. My family purchased the series for me off of Amazon, and I sat down to watch seasons 1 & 2 in marathon fashion. I enjoyed the narrator Henry Louis Gates, Jr. However, about five episodes in, I started noticing a heavy handed slavery theme. It seems to me there is a definite political message that is over portrayed in each person's family tree. Gates wanted to track down any ancestor of each guest that owned slaves or participated in the civil war. At first, it was interesting, but then it got to be too much. Particularly political for me was the episode with Kyra Sedgwick and Kevin Bacon. On previous shows, many ordinary black citizens volunteered to have their ethnicity tested by 23and me. They were each asked in advance how African American, Native American or European they really are. In this instance, the show took the results into a High School classroom. Then Gates proceeded to teach the students about the founding fathers and how they owned slaves.  I was not happy about the indoctrination and revisionist history theme, as well as having minors participate in discussing DNA testing in front of their peers at school. This was way over the top. I was watching the series with my family and as a mother, I would not want this happening in an every day classroom in America. There is a strong message of ""things are not what they seem"" and color lines are blurry. Good message, but very persistent delivery. Overall, interesting look at paper trail and genetic genealogy, but I would not recommend watching the discs back to back.

It does, however, show the use of DNA studies (done through 23andme) in the research of family history.  Too bad it doesn't also use autosomal DNA results.",1404604800,,464,5.315068493150685

5089823,1,B007IUEDTO,"While there is much well made and interesting content here I will not give those elements the stars it would otherwise get due to one massive issue that should not be ignored.

Whenever talking about American Indian roots and about Indians in what is now Latin America
there is a blatant rancid air of constant intellectual censorship that maintains the US media and political culture unrelenting policy of Holocaust Denial in a country that is obsessed with the European Holocaust but insists on total denial of the Americas and or American Holocaust.
There is more here about Spaniards killing Jews in Spain much welcomed by the official doctrine of American TV than at the same time avoiding the 60 million Indians who were exterminated by the Conquistadors. Then later the English-Speaking Protestants killed another 30 million in North America.

In this show they manage once again to maintain American and British TVs obsession with all things Jewish while insisting on an editorial line that avoids the America Holocaust and the extermination of at least 90 million native peoples of the New World. I also strongly question the show's DNA classification of MIDDLE EASTERN for Jewish as this is very confused and not clarified...does Middle Eastern in this American parlance also include North Africa a common distortion of the already colonial phrase Middle East which in fact is West Asia. Spanish Jews were often from North Africa while others from many other places a term like Middle Eastern proves nothing. In the USA it is presumed European Jews come from the so-called Middle East but there is no inclusion here of Arab ethnicity. Americans inparticular are taught not to know the concept of Arab Jews and that they are the only Jews who come from West Asia and Spanish Jews are the most likely to have links with them. While the overwhelming majority of Jews such as myself have ancestory in Central Asia NOT West Asia  a fact that American Zionists and the Israel lobby does not want Americans to know and thus cowardly PBS would not go anywhere near. Linda Chavez will still not think she has Arab DNA which if the classification of MIDDLE EASTERN is honest is far more likely to be the true meaning of that DNA as being Jewish is not the same thing as ethnicity. For example if you did DNA testing on a broad cross section of Israeli Jews that includes both Russians and Ethiopians they will not share the same marker.

There is one moment when Henry Louis Gates after describing actions by the Spanish upon Indians in New Mexico that was clearly an example of their genocidal conduct merely brushes it off with a shallow remark about a war for survival...so in other words it was okay then
there was no genocide or holocaust in the Americas it was just a mere ""clash of cultures""
clearly Mr Gates took to his Yale ""Uncle Tom"" indoctrination with relish for flag, empire and embedded denialism. Appropriate for Yale a university that invites major war criminals
to teach that indoctrination to its students.",1363564800,3,3025,4.833976833976834
5089824,5,B007IUEDTO,"Finding Your Roots features 25 famous people on three disks and totals ten hours. European immigrants like Martha Stewart can usually be identified from written records, but there is the problem that many immigrants change their names in order to Americanize their European names.
For Africans who are descended from slaves there is the problem of European blood that is difficult to pin down (in many cases it comes from the master). The records of slaves in the southern states list their value as property on slaveholder records that also list the value of their cows, hogs and chickens. Those lists only have a single name for a slave.
In order to find an African tribe as a place of origin it is necessary to use DNA analysis. It cannot be assumed that a slave came from West Africa because many came from North and East African countries. In fact, it has been discovered that the blues originated in North Africa, not in the Mississippi Delta.
Finally, I'd like to lodge a complaint. Why does PBS have to put advertising on their DVDs? Are the tea party folks trying to do to PBS what they did to the post office? Willard Mitt Romney said that if our kids want to see Big Bird they will have to watch lots of commercials, but he lost. This is ridiculous!",1358985600,2,1260,4.5550660792951545

So, you know the premise, celebrated guests' family trees are researched and their DNA is tested.  I found that even when I didn't really know much (or anything) about a guest, the program was still often really interesting.  There was one Africa American guest who discovered that her ancestors weren't slaves--they were free before the American Revolution.  Another guest had free ancestors who were kidnapped in Ohio and re-enslaved.  There were so many interesting stories.  Along with revealing his guests' stories host Henry Louis Gates gives us some history lessons.  Often times people who emigrated to America were fleeing events happening in their home country.  Gates discusses those events.  If you are lucky you will find one of the guests has a similar background to yours, and you can learn something about your own roots.  For instance, one of the guests had German ancestors who came to Pennsylvania in the 1740s, which is just like my ancestors.  I learned they were escaping the 30 years war.  This series is well worth watching.  So glad my library has this series.",1469664000,2,1510,5.215767634854772
