Don't get discouraged, do your best, hit rewind until you get it, and have a blast!  I know I probably look like a fool, but I feel like a dancer!",1121126400,2,270,4.36
8178158,2,B00004WZ50,This video was disappointing as it was very fast with little explanation of difficult moves. I have taken a lot of dance classes and found it frustrating to keep up with even after several viewings. Many of the moves are accomplished while turning repeatedly. The instructor is irritating at best as she giggles throughout and gives no information on proper alignment. The background dancers are bored.,998870400,2,402,5.106060606060606
