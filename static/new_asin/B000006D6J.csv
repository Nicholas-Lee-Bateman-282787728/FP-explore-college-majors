7904034,5,B000006D6J,"Understated, organic and tender, these two films are the perfect primer for Ross McElwee's magnum opus: ""Sherman's March"".  In ""Backyard"" we are presented with a bemused study of class distinctions, and in ""Charleen"" we meet the Earth godess going about her multple enterprises with a rag tag group of singers and musicians.  She dispenses her tutelage with wit, graciousnes and verve.  God bless Ross McElwee.",994204800,6,410,5.276923076923077
