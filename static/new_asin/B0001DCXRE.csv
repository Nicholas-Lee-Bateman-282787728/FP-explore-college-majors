1990264,5,B0001DCXRE,"This is so addective. Its alot better then sailor moon, cardcaptor sakura and saint tail. There are 6episodes per dvd.
This deserves 10stars.",1079654400,,141,5.173913043478261
1990265,4,B0001DCXRE,"There are three series that I have always wanted to see released in the US:

1. Saint Tail, which was released by Tokyopop and remains one of my all-time favorite anime.

2. Hime-chan no Ribon, my other favorite Mahou Shoujo series, which I still hope will someday be licensed.

3. Wedding Peach, the title you are currently looking at.

It's easy to judge Wedding Peach. After following on Sailor Moon's heels as one of the first Mahou Shoujo anime to feature combat, Wedding Peach appears to have nothing original to offer. But Wedding Peach not only equals it's predecessor, Sailor Moon--it rises above and beyond it. Whereas Sailor Moon would often (tragically) sucuumb to it's own sentai-inspired ""monster-per-day"" formula, Wedding Peach provides a much faster-paced and far more detailed plot line. Taking inspiration from Shakespeare, Christianity and Roman Mythology, Wedding Peach interweaves heartfelt, touching romance and a battle of epic proportions. It also features beautiful character designs by Kazuko Tadano, who also character designed Sailor Moon. Wedding Peach's visuals, however, far outdo Sailor Moon's--as a look at the box will tell you. Wedding Peach, of course, features it's own share of filler episodes, silly quirks and light comedy, but even these episodes shine above most of Sailor Moon's equivalents.

Wedding Peach is an absolute must-have for fans of the mahou shoujo genre, or fans of romantic anime at all. This is one series that--though it starts slow--is sure not to disappoint.",1076284800,,1519,5.286307053941909
8010461,5,B0001DCXRE,"I lost a disk prior so I decided to buy another and it came with this cool box that fit all 3 boxes in it (the new one and the two complete series), also came with a cool beach ball!",1424304000,,182,3.575
8010462,5,B0001DCXRE,"I LOVE this series. It has rapidly become my favorite anime series, I even went so far to seek out the soundtrack for it which was quite difficult as Wedding Peach isn't very popular here in America. Basic plotline is evident. Momoko is a fairly average school girl, she has the hots for the captain of the school soccer team, she is a member of the journalism club at her school and then one day she finds out that she is a love angel, destined to protect the world against devils who wish to destrol all love and loving hearts from the world. I first thought this series was going to be so stupid, but I started watching it and I couldn't stop! As the characters develop they start become more important especially the relationship between Momoko and Yousuke, a member of the soccer team that she first hated and then begins to fall in love with. There were times when there would be scenes so dramatic and deep that I would stop and have to reevaluate my perception of the series. It's a comedy series yet it has action and major drama and romance. I also happen to like the English voices; it's an older dubbing which is a shame because I'm not sure those voice actors are even still in the buisness. I think it's actually some of the best dubbing I've come across so far, though if you don't like it, you can always watch it in Japanese with the subtitles.",1128643200,3,1361,4.362204724409449
8010463,4,B0001DCXRE,I wish this how had some profanity and sexually situations if their going to have girls were skimpy clothes. Like Sailor Moon these girls can do magic. What pissed me off is when Momoko the junior high student wouldn't let Aphrodite's lieutenant Limone and Reine Devilla's servant Pluie fight each other that's what anime is all about. I don't want to see people get along but she have to step in and do her love magic which is so care bear style.,1118534400,,447,4.463414634146342
8010464,3,B0001DCXRE,"Likely the most potent Sailor Moon clone of all time, Wedding Peach is cutesy but lacks the originality and irresitible fun of what it is trying so hard to mimic. Regardless, it does have those nice little pros which we all hate to love. With a hopelessly generic plot and a cast of cute but annoying characters, Wedding Peach plants itself firmly under the guilty pleasure section-and where is its appeal, you ask? Well, like I said, it IS cute-and its dazzling prettiness should come off as irresistible to those desperate for more Sailor Moon-esque action. Another perk is that Tomokazu Seki, possibly my favorite seiyuu, positively breathes life into his role as Ignus (whom, sadly, we don't meet until volume 5)-and his appearances are one of the brightest points of the series. A disappointment, however, is that the anime seems to have dumbed itself down a bit from the manga, which is twice as innovative. The series seems far more directed towards children than its grittier original graphic novel form-and therefore a lot of the appeal has been diminished and replaced with typical magical girl sappiness and predictability, which we've already seen way too much of. Some of the characters look shockingly different from their manga counterparts-Hinagiku and Jamapi being the most radical examples. And the dub is almost excruciating to watch, so I highly recommend the original version. If you are lucky enough to find the sweet, distinct charm that lies beneath all that predictable froth, then you may find yourself in for a treat. Missteps aside, Wedding Peach stands strong as a fluffy, frothy guilty pleasure-though it may be venomous to the brain, it is as delicious as creme brulee to the palette. So does it bring anything fantastically new to the anime world? Well, no. But you're not likely to find sweeter candy.",1105401600,,1834,4.977198697068404
8010465,5,B0001DCXRE,"About wedding peach,like all magical girl animes,is about a girl who can transform into a super heroine and fight enemies. Also later on in the series,she gets comrades to fight along with her.

At last,after it's release in 1995,they finally are releasing the series in english on DVD which should have been done several years ago.better than never i guess!

The Dvd itself was nice with an animated menu.

i have watched the dubbed version.i guess everyone had an okay voice. Momoko just had a voice that i could NOT stand (>_<). She sounds like a 3 year old (o_0)

.(almost like serena's infamous voice) it too childish and stupid. But the dialouge kept close to the original.

i prefer watching the series in it's original japanese.(with subs of course). which i think is much better ^_^

anyways if you love shoujo (girl) anime ,then get Wedding peach =)!

wedding ! oronaish!",1092268800,,881,4.756578947368421
8010466,5,B0001DCXRE,"Glad to see this out. I bought the box set and got the inflatable beach ball! Definitly worth it. The anime is very cute and if you like magical girl anime, you'll like this. There will be 10 DVDs out and i'll be getting them all!",1087776000,,230,4.021739130434782
8010467,5,B0001DCXRE,wedding peach is everything you would expect from a magical girl anime its funny sappy sweet and serious when the need arises this series so far exceds sailor moon in quality because it flows more quickly with fewer fillers and the characters have some good depth to them and they are funny to watch. if you are a fan of sailor moon ccs or tokyo mew mew wedding peach is one for you,1083628800,,382,4.2465753424657535
8010468,5,B0001DCXRE,"[I would probably give this 4 1/2 stars, if it were an option]
  At first glance, Wedding Peach seems to be a lower budget rip-off of Sailor Moon.  The main character, Momoko, or Wedding Peach, is a clutzy junior high school girl who sleeps late and likes to eat.  She uses a brooch to transform, and the transformation scenes and attacks are very reminiscent of Sailor Moon.  However...
  There is a reason why we liked Sailor Moon.  It was cute, it was quirky, it was entertaining.  Sure, we always knew what would happen...eventually, Sailor Moon would conquer the bad guys by joining together with her friends, and believing in the power of love.  But we still watched it, and we still loved it.  So why not love Wedding Peach as well?  Different characters, slightly different plot (Raindevilla is out to destroy all of the love in the world instead of collecting rainbow crystals, or finding the imperium silver crystal, or the pure heart, or whatever the fourth season was about), but it is still the formula we love!
  Although I've only seen the 1st DVD (which contains 6 episodes!!), it already seems to me that Wedding Peach will not be quite the same ""enemy of the day"" as Sailor Moon.  Or at least, the enemy doesn't seem as if it will be presented in the same way every time.  Also, the story line seems to move a little more quickly; we have already met THREE Wedding angels, seen Jama-P go from bad to good (we hope!) AND met Momoko's possible love interest.  One of the things I always thought was a bit of a down side to Sailor Moon was that there were just SO MANY episodes, and the story moved SO SLOWLY!
  All in all, if you liked Sailor Moon, or any other magical girl anime, give Wedding Peach a try.  Otherwise, this won't be up your alley at all.",1082505600,2,1771,4.457943925233645
8010469,5,B0001DCXRE,"...and attack with rings, lipstick, a watch, and a bouquet. Not your ordinary weapons, even for a magical girl series. But it's true. And actually works pretty well. But be expected to hear sap every few seconds. The heroines get their powers from the greatness of love and their dreams of getting married. The villains are demons looking to harness the power of love through the Sacred Four Somethings (which are four items that a woman is supposed to wear in a Western-type marriage--they will supposedly bring her happiness). Of course, once the demons have the Four Somethings, then they plan to destroy them and wipe out love altogether. Wedding Peach and her pals plan to stop that.
The colors in this are bright and cheery, and the dialogue can get rather childish and goofy at some points. Not that this is a bad thing--these girls are still in junior high, so they are making the transition out of childhood. The designs for the wedding dresses and the 'armored' outfits are top notch and gorgous to look at, which is a definite plus.
There are six episodes on this dvd; this is a bonus considering that many dvds only have two or three episodes for the same price. And while there are not many extras, just the usual clean opening/closing animation, I still felt I got my money's worth with this dvd.
I saw these episodes a few years back on fansub, and loved them. I had always thought that there must be more to the story, since the girls had not had a chance to do anything (and I knew that another heroine was coming), but the video store only had the two tapes. Imagine my excitement when I found out that there are other volumes after this one! So I am eagerly awaiting the second dvd, not just because it has new episodes I've never seen, but in the hopes that my favorite character will (finally) arrive....
I have also read the translated manga, and I recommend that as well.
All in all, I suggest you get this dvd if you are into shows like Sailor Moon, Revolutionary Girl Utena, or any other type of magical girl show. You will not be disappointed. Both the dub and sub versions of Wedding Peach are good, though I tend to watch the Japanese version cause its what I saw first and think is better. But you can make your own decision.",1080086400,2,2254,4.48661800486618
