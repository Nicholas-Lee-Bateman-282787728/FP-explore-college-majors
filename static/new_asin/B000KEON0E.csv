2688669,4,B000KEON0E,"I love Turbo Jam Cardio Party Mix 1, so I thought I would try Cardio Party Mix 2 as well.  Instructor Charlene Johnson leads a large class of mostly the same participants from CP1, with Mindy and AnnaRita again showing lower-impact modifications. Those who have not yet done one of Chalene's workouts will find her cueing to be a bit lacking, but if you are already familiar with Turbo Jam and Chalene's ""11 Elite Moves,"" you should have no problems following along.

The 4-minute CP2 warm-up is very similar to CP1: Chalene begins with a few shoulder rolls, reviews each of the punches (jab, cross, hook, and upper), and then goes into the same series of stretches. The first cardio segment is about 7 minutes long, and it begins with 4 jabs to the front. Chalene adds on the turbo twist (jab-cross-jab-knee) and eventually incorporates uppercuts as well to form a little combo. After completing the combo to the one side, you do jab-knees plus a pump with a jab, then go back and repeat the original combo on the other side.

The second cardio segment is 6 minutes long, and Chalene says at the beginning that she's going to bring down the intensity (unlike in CP1, which seemed to get increasingly intense up until the turbo). She starts with a march (one-two-three-knee), eventually changing the knee lifts to front and back push kicks, then adding repeater knees to form a combo. The second combo consists of 1) a speed bag with a crunch to either side followed by uppercuts, and then 2) a knee up with one punch diagonally up, one punch diagonally down. You then repeat the first combo to the other side.

The pace picks up a bit in the third cardio segment, also about 7 minutes long. Standing in horse stance, you'll do 4 cross punches with a zig-zag knee, eventually adding on a single-single-double punch. The next combination includes a turbo jab (a side shuffle with 3 jabs and then a cross) and clockwork (jab-cross-jab-cross to the side, then repeated to the front). After repeating to the other side, you're ready for the turbo: a 1.5 minute high intensity segment. Here, Charlene begins with a jump squat, moves into fast punches and jab-knees, and ends with both fast and high jogs.

Following the turbo, there is the usual 30-second water break, and then a 7-minute ""dance recovery"" segment (which I didn't find to be very dance-y at all). In this segment, you'll combine a step front/side kick-step back/speed bag with a knee/side push to either side. For some reason, this sequence felt very awkward to me, and I found myself frequently off the beat. The second combo consists of a side shuffle with 6 side jabs, a punch up/punch down, and squat/claps in-between. The 4.5 minute finale is very similar to CP1 except that the order is reversed: you'll start with high-low jabs to the side, then do quick crosses to the front with a knee, eventually adding a single-single-double cross. However, I thought that this segment did not have the same revved up feel as the CP1 finale.

Finally, you'll begin lowering your heart rate with finesse, a 3-minute segment of slow steps and kicks. The moves are a bit more complex here than in the finesse segment of CP1, yet they are performed slowly enough that they're easy to pick up quickly. The 2-minute cool-down consists of about 1 minute Tai Chi moves and 1 minute of brief stretches, bringing the entire workout time in at just under 43 minutes.

Overall, I did enjoy this workout, but not as much as CP1 for several reasons. First of all, whereas I thought the music in CP1 was a lot of fun and I recognized several of the tunes, this wasn't the case here (at the end of the DVD, I saw that ""Baby Got Back"" was listed, and although I know this song, I didn't notice it either of the two times I did the workout!). Secondly, I found that my heart rate varied more during this workout than with CP1; I had to make a conscious effort to keep the intensity level up. Third, Chalene's instruction was more subdued in this workout, which kind of decreased the overall energy level and took away some of the fun factor for me. Finally, I simply found the individual exercises and combinations in CP2 to be less enjoyable, especially given that there was less kicking. In addition to finding the dance party segment to be awkward, I also found the side shuffles (used in both the 3rd cardio segment and the dance recovery) to be repetitive as well as difficult given my limited room to move side-to-side in my exercise space.

In summary, though, like CP1, this is a still a solid, fun, and fairly intense cardio workout, and so I think that most people who enjoy CP1 (and other Turbo Jam workouts) would enjoy this as well.",1193702400,9,4683,4.6201923076923075
2688670,5,B000KEON0E,"I own nearly all the Turbo Jam videos, and Cardio Party Mix 2 is by far my favorite.  The energy from the Turbo Jam cast is infectious (everyone seems to be truly enjoying themselves, which is a stark contrast to other subdued videos), which makes this work out so much fun.  And by having so much fun, you'll forget you're even working out and the time just flies by!  Personally, I really enjoy the dancier moves in this, as compared to the other TJ videos, because it really burns off a lot of steam for me.  Like the other reviewer said, the moves might be tricky if you're not familiar with Turbo Jam, but once you do it a few times, they should come naturally.  I highly recommend this video!",1176163200,19,698,4.338461538461538
2688671,4,B000KEON0E,"Cardio Party Mix 2 is the second Turbo Jam video I have tried; the other is Cardio Party Mix 1, so I'll be comparing and contrasting the two in this review.

2688692,5,B000KEON0E,"I think this is my favorite Turbo Jam workout so far.  It definitely takes it up a notch from cardio party 1.  I felt like I hit a plateau and needed to change up my workout.  I tried the fat blaster one and really disliked it.  So I decided to try cardio party 2 and after a week saw a difference in tone.  The workouts are similar so if you're upgrading from 1, it will take a little getting used to.  I find myself reverting back to cardio 1 sometimes because the moves and music are very close.  All in all I'm really liking the moves and the music is great.  I recommend giving it a shot.",1443744000,,593,4.0085470085470085
2688693,5,B000KEON0E,Absolutely love turbo. This dvd kicked it up just a notched from the first.!! Perfect for anyone who loves to Turbo!!!!,1441152000,,119,4.714285714285714
2688694,1,B000KEON0E,"I love turbo jam, and have searched for this specific video for 2 years now. I understand now why it is so hard to get ahold of, they obviously did not make many of them because the work out is so lame! I was quite bored with this workout even before midway thru. The other turbo jams I will do over and over and love, this one left much to be desired!",1424649600,9,352,3.9027777777777777
2688695,5,B000KEON0E,I enjoyed the work out.  It wasn't boring.  Since I am a senior; I am also recommend it to seniors.,1409788800,,99,3.9
2688696,5,B000KEON0E,"After I got Turbo Jam Cardio Party Mix 2, I tried it out right away and fell in love with it. It makes you sweat and your whole body starts to ache. It's worth it for those who like intense cardio, but for those who like it a bit mild you could try to find something else. Me? I just love the feeling I have after I work hard on a long workout. It's satisfying. I love the adrenalin that comes with it too.",1405123200,,406,3.8452380952380953
2688697,4,B000KEON0E,"This Cardio Party was hard for me to like at first, because CP1 was so fun for me. For some reason, Cardio Party 2 seems slower. To make up for the perceived slowness, I added heavier hand weights. I usually use the 1.5 lb set that came with my TJ kit, but for this one, I use a 3 lb set. That solved the ""easy"" factor and I enjoy the DVD more now. Each Cardio Party has a different feel to it, and I guess I just wasn't ready for that. I do think that this one is a great introduction to the Fat Burning Elite set, as it has some new moves introduced at an easier pace. Some of those same moves are in Punch, Kick, and Jam at a much faster pace! All in all, a good workout if you work to up the challenge a little bit (added weight/gloves, higher-impact moves).",1384473600,3,762,3.9545454545454546
2688698,5,B000KEON0E,"I love this workout - the moves are great, the music a little old-school but helps keep the tempo moving. I have several TurboJam workouts, and always liked this one the best so just had to replace it when my original copy got too scratched to use anymore. There are jumping off points for a 10-15min quick workout, or do the whole 45min as time allows, so you can tailor it to your liking. Also the amount of activity you do during the workout can be individualized as well - some mornings I'm into it and others not so much, but any kind of movement is burning calories and shaping and toning, so this is a great all-over workout. I highly recommend it, and have, for many years now.",1381708800,2,685,4.317829457364341

I gets my party on early in the am with Turbo Jams and it just set me up with a great day after this workout,1378771200,,272,3.857142857142857

2688704,4,B000KEON0E,"I tried this for the first time today, and I enjoyed it, worked up a good sweat... But it seemed a little slow. That could be because I have been using Turbo Fire, which is a much higher intensity, but then again it could be the workout itself. Either way, mission accomplished!",1375315200,,278,4.365384615384615
2688705,5,B000KEON0E,I love the turbo jam series.  This workout dvd is so much fun.  I really appreciate that all of Chalene Johnson's turbo dvd's have a couple of people in her video's doing a modified workout.,1372377600,,190,4.4

2688707,5,B000KEON0E,Really like Chalene and her turbo exercises.  Will keep doing until I am too old to do anymore.  Added benefit for me is that these exercises really help my back.  Did not expect that.  This is my favorite of the cardio party dvds.,1366934400,,231,4.3023255813953485
2688708,4,B000KEON0E,"I have two other Turbo Jams and just wanted another to add to variety.  I actually liked the music in this one better than the others, but the exercises are pretty much the same type as the others.  It just adds variety.",1366675200,,220,4.214285714285714
2688709,5,B000KEON0E,"Cardio Party Mix 2 is my favorite of the 3 Cardio Party videos.  The music is great, right on target with the moves and it seems like the team is having so much fun.  I also really like the Finesse Cool Down at the end.  I would say that if you liked Cardio Party Mix 1 you will like this one too.  There are a lot of similar moves.  Have fun!",1366588800,,343,3.7746478873239435
2688710,4,B000KEON0E,"I love Turbo Jam and continue to build my collection. Cardio Mix 2 is a little tricky at first, there are some new moves, but once you get the hang of it it is a blast. This DVD only has one workout, which runs approximently 43 minutes, this includes a warm up and cool down. After buying the first Turbo Jam, a two disc set with five different workouts, I was a little bummed and had perhaps expected a little more for the money. Otherwise, Turbo Jam as a whole is my favorite series of cardio workout and I recommend it every chance I get.",1364860800,,541,4.161904761904762

2688714,5,B000KEON0E,"I love all of the Turbos... TurboJam,  Cardio Party 1, 2 and 3, and TurboFire. These are great workouts for both intensity and for burning off that stubborn fat. Saddle bags, muffin top, and fat inside of the thigh will be zapped away with these Turbo workouts. If you are just starting a workout routine, then start with TurboJam.. TurboFire is highly intense, so work your way up if you are thinking about doing the Turbo Series. I cant recommend the Turbo Series enough!

It works totally different muscles then the first one and I feel that the 2 workouts complement each other well. The only negative thing I have to say about this one is that the music is quieter than she is sooooo if you turn it up to get the music louder she is also louder but it isn't too bad just something worth mentioning! I would defiantly recommend this dvd to anyone, especially if you have the first one and want to mix it up a little!!",1315094400,,542,4.027777777777778

2688726,4,B000KEON0E,"I really liked this video workout, but you have to get the first Cardio Party mix with the moves explanation. I had bought the first dvd of ""5 Rockin Workouts"" and had it for several years before I really got into it. Its a great workout, but takes a while to get the moves before you actually feel like you know what you are doing.",1313539200,4,332,4.123076923076923
2688727,5,B000KEON0E,"The product was obviously shipped immediately as I received it 2 days after I ordered it.  Great service!!  I love the CD, the music is great and I like the interval training on this one.  I have 1 and 2 and will be ordering 3 soon.  I have limited time because I work a lot but I also want to stay fit and keep my weight under control.  I feel that I get a lot out of doing Charlenes CD even just twice a week, it definately makes me sweat.  I would definately recommend this product.",1311552000,,485,4.0
2688728,3,B000KEON0E,"I was hooked on turbo jam after Cardio Party 1 (the one that comes with the Maximum Results Kit) due to the amazing music, which included songs that I knew (i.e. ""Goodies"" by Ciara, ""Blame it on the boogie"" by Jackson 5, ""Mama said knock you out"" by LL Cool J). I often felt like I was dancing during Cardio Party 1 and it felt like fun and not exercise...and according to my heart rate monitor, I burned 470 calories in 45 minutes.

Well, you will not get that with Cardio Party 2 or Cardio Party 3. Neither video has recognizable songs that you just want to dance to. Each workout will, however, give you awesome cardio workouts, and leave you feeling great, as Chalene always does...however they are just NOT as fun and actually do feel like exercise, since you don't have those songs you just want to groove to! So if that music from cardio Party 1 is what got you excited about turbo jam, then you might not want to purchase Cardio Party 2 and 3, because unfortunately you won't find it.",1309651200,9,992,4.3621621621621625
2688729,4,B000KEON0E,Loved the video.  Fun music and a motivating host.  Seems a bit silly at times but I just go with it and have fun.,1309564800,,114,3.7083333333333335
2688730,5,B000KEON0E,"This was the finale TJ Cardio Party that I purchased.  I bought the Cardio Party 1 with the 5 workouts 1st and then purchased Cardio Party 3.  As the Cardio Party ""final"" addition to my collection, I have to say, initially I was turned off the first time I did this video.  I felt like I did not get near the intensity and ""sweat factor"" of this one compared to 1 and 3.  However, I gave it another chance and have to say that I have changed my mind and really like it.  I was able to really turn up the intensity the 2nd go around and felt like I sweated way more and was more out of breath than the first run through.  Definately a satisfied purchase and addition to my collection.  The moves and music make it just as fun as the other two Cardio Party workouts and I love Chalene so you can't go wrong buying this DVD.  I am an intermediate exerciser, who does 50 min - 1 hr/ 6 days a week exercises and felt like I really got a good workout from this video both aerobically as well as building muscle throughout my body.",1291593600,12,1024,4.085
2688731,4,B000KEON0E,"I really liked Turbo Jam 1 and got this just in order to have some variety. But it's as if they took all the most fun moves and combined them here, so I enjoy this one quite a lot more. You really work up a sweat - it's genuine exercise - and I love the variety and the music. The time segments are just long enough so they carry you smoothly through the routine and you don't get bored. My only complaint is that Chalene is quite inept with her verbal cuing about what move is coming next - so you basically have to memorize the routine in order to avoid confusion. When she does the cuing right, like one musical measure before the change of step, it is great because you can truly relax into what you are doing. But at least half the time she announces the change right as it's happening, or even a bit after the fact. Irritating! But I do recommend the DVD.",1279670400,,861,4.130952380952381
2688732,5,B000KEON0E,"This is a great workout and I love the new music!
Major sweating involved once you learn all the new moves. It seems there is more punching in this one than cardio 1. My body is killing me from the new moves.

I recommend getting this one!!!",1278892800,,241,4.127659574468085
2688733,5,B000KEON0E,"I LOVE this workout. I already owned the first turbo, and was pretty much hooked, and this one is just as great as the others. I plan to get the rest.",1265587200,,150,3.870967741935484
2688734,5,B000KEON0E,"The first time I did this workout did not like it all. I could not follow the moves and just did not enjoy it  That was way back last year when I first started TJ.  After doing Cardio party 1 and Punch, kick and Jam for months, I decided to try Cardio Party 2 again.  I loved it!  And after the first time, I started to look forward to doing it and thinking about it every day!  Love the music, love the moves.  May not be good for a beginner but once you get used to Chalene's moves, you'll be fine. Definitely a great addition to your home workout collection!",1261180800,,561,4.054545454545455
2688735,5,B000KEON0E,I love Charlene and Turbo Jam.  This was the perfect addition to my Turbo Jam collection.  I wasn't sure I would like it as much as the 1st one from a couple of reviews saying she wasn't as upbeat...I don't think so at all!!!,1259539200,3,225,4.090909090909091
2688736,4,B000KEON0E,"This is a great way to get a wonderful workout and have fun at the same time.  The DVD is about 45 minutes long, but you don't even notice the time.  I own several Turbo Jam DVDs, and this is one of my favorites.",1258329600,,212,3.7954545454545454
2688737,5,B000KEON0E,Turbo Jam 2 is my favorite I think.  I love doing turbo jam.  It has gotten me is fabulous shape.  I love Chalean.  She is such and inspiration.  Thanks Turbo Jam for a fun workout routine.  Don't hesitate... BUY IT!  Good for beginner... Better for moderate to advanced fitness levels.,1256256000,,286,4.6
2688738,5,B000KEON0E,"Charlene motivates me.  The music makes me eager to get up in the morning (5:30 am, before work) and ""jam"".  The crew have believable before/after pictures and stories.  The moves are easy and fun.  You forget you're working out.",1254355200,,229,4.794871794871795
2688739,5,B000KEON0E,Lots of fun and a nice change since I only had Mix 1 for a while.,1252886400,,65,3.125
2688740,5,B000KEON0E,"I really like the turbo jam workouts....the music IS great.  I'm 46 years old....and the music is what really motivates you...well, along with Charlene, of coarse!  Can't wait to try the live workout!",1237420800,,200,5.03030303030303
2688741,3,B000KEON0E,"The workout itself is pretty good.  Lots of kicks and it gets your blood pumping pretty quickly however, do not buy this if you have not tried any of the turbo jam videos before.  There are no instructions available on how to do the moves. She just goes right into the timed workout. It is kind of disappointing, as it took me a while to make sure I was doing them correctly.",1235433600,,375,4.194444444444445
2688742,5,B000KEON0E,My family absolutely loves this Video.  Chalene Johnson makes exercising so much fun!  The music is fun and funky but it is Chalene and her crew that really make the tape enjoyable.  We look forward to buying all of her videos/D.V.D's in the near future.  I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to have fun and break a sweat!,1234828800,,335,4.442622950819672
2688743,5,B000KEON0E,This is the most fun Turbo Jam cardio DVD there IS! I've done this one over and over again because the moves are just so much fun and they don't get old. This one is very much worth the money.,1228089600,10,192,3.825
2688744,5,B000KEON0E,"Cardio Party Mix 2 is really great! The music is awesome and really gets you motivated. I love the routines, it is a great mix and blends really well with the music she has chosen. I love how her routines are 2-3 minutes in length, then change to a different one, then move on to the opposite side. Chalene really makes working out fun, and this DVD is a must to add to your collection! One of my favorites, also I recommend Cardio Party 3, that one is just as good. I find it is good to have lots of variety, so I have all her DVD's. This one to me is one of the best though, everything in it is fabulous!",1226361600,3,606,3.9754098360655736
2688745,5,B000KEON0E,"I don't care for this particular Cardio Party Mix 2 DVD. It's not bad, it's just I couldn't get into the music like I did in the Cardio Party Mixes 1 & 3. Still a great workout.",1221004800,,177,3.810810810810811
2688746,5,B000KEON0E,"Great GREAT music in this one. Love the sequence of the routine. Love the inspirational energy. Fun and challenging as usual. LOVE THIS ONE like I do Cardio Party 1 and Punch, Kick and Jam. Way better than Cardio Party 3 as well. Just skip cardio party 3 and get this one...",1217894400,2,274,4.288461538461538
2688747,5,B000KEON0E,"I purchased this after buying the 5 workout DVD to begin my Turbo Jam workouts.  I loved them so much, I had to have more!  I do these workouts 5 days a week, and have done them for almost 2 years now.  I never get tired of these!  Chalene Johnson is a hoot!  She and the other Turbo Jammers keep you motivated and entertained, too!  Chalene will also give instructions prior to each new move, so it's pretty easy to follow, even if you haven't tried the instructional video.",1212624000,,475,4.280898876404494
2688748,5,B000KEON0E,"I got this DVD last week and picked up all the moves the second time I watched it.  It's a lot of fun and simple to follow!  I combine this with the Turbo Sculpt workout for a good sweat, plus I use the weighted gloves to up my intensity.  I don't think it's incredibly challenging, but it does leave you feeling like you worked out and wanting more.  I think I like this workout more than the cardio party mix 1, although both are just as enjoyable!  I'm still trying to catch on to Cardio Mix 3...",1200009600,3,499,4.103092783505154
