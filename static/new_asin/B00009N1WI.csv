1886632,5,B00009N1WI,"TNT's Western Epic ""Monte Walsh"" replaces ""Tombstone"" as the best western film yet made. A stellar cast and gripping story prove once again that the western is still alive! Grade: A+",1055635200,14,182,4.903225806451613
1886633,5,B00009N1WI,"This movie has just premiered on cable TV in the UK, and I've no hesitation in rating it as one of the best westerns I've ever seen: beautifully shot, scripted and acted, and much less pessimistic than the original Lee Marvin vehicle.  Yet again, Simon Wincer proves himself a western director in the tradition of John Ford, and in Tom Selleck he has found a leading man to surpass even John Wayne.  I've just advance-ordered my DVD copy, and I can't wait!",1055030400,21,456,4.548780487804878
1886634,5,B00009N1WI,"The cowboys portrayed in this Tom Selleck western performed a disservice for all of the people today who think government assistance is the only means of improving your life.  Why, they didn't appear to need the government at all!  This, in the thinking of many Americans, is highly unpatriotic.
These cowboys simply endured terrible working conditions, being outdoors in all weathers, without whining; an episode during the early part of the film shows Walsh (Selleck) driving through a terrible winter storm, all on his own, giving no thought whatever to this hazardous workplace situation or complaining to a union representative.
The movie opens with numerous cowboys unemployed due to modernization and corporate expansion into the cattle industry.  They foolishly continued traveling about, in search of work, rather than appealing to the government for welfare assistance -- the implication being they were rather independent sorts given to earning their subsistence rather than begging or demanding it from the state.
These unfortunate men obviously had no labor union representation whatever, and could be fired/hired based on the judgment of employers.  This in UnAmerican, as about half of us today (per a survey conducted November 2000) believe that a worker's need for his paycheck has priority over his employer's ability to provide it, since all employers are evil and rich.
These cowboys were subject to egregious workplace harassment, as when they drove a herd to a railhead only to see it spooked by an insensitive engineer who considered it ""fun"" to blow the whistle and spook the herd.  The cowboys, rather than squealing to Human Resources or filing charges with the National Labor Relations Board, then horribly vandalized the train.  Because the train was owned by a large greedy corporation, that really wasn't a problem -- but the action constituted reverse harassment against the train personnel who had participated in the hostile whistle prank, as they felt scared and threatened in this hostile working environment.
There was no sort of Federal Lunch Program, and the cowboys were forced to eat food cooked in obviously unregulated circumstances, vulnerable to the cook's sabotage.  (The dinner incident constituted additional harassment, but the cowboys again did not file any sort of complaint.)
The big evil greedy cattle companies provided no sort of retirement programs.  It was required, after your trade usefulness had expired, for you to ride your horse over a cliff.
Finally, these American cowboys didn't appear to understand the need for lawyers, as they simply took the law into their own hands and did what they thought was correct (but their thinking obviously was flawed -- see the seven paragraphs above).  They probably would have just shot a lawyer, had any lawyer on Earth possessed sufficient merit to be in the presence of men like this.",1054771200,23,2887,5.245119305856833

1886667,5,B00009N1WI,How sad when true freedom is lost; stomped out of existence by progress. Sometimes simpler is better. Too bad in most instances we come to realize that far too late. Tom Selleck did a fine job in this remake of a Lee Marvin film. It was poignant with too many loses but in the end pride remained and that's all anyone can ask; that dignity endures in the face of all that's designed to take it away. See this movie. I recommend it. So says SurlyPoet from Twitter and Gab.,1490227200,,471,4.2444444444444445

1886727,5,B00009N1WI,"I saw this recently for the first time. It is a very good movie. A good character development film that just plain tells a good story. It doesn't need to fill every scene with action because it has a great cast that can work a script and everyone does their jobs to our delight. I have not read the book or seen the original with Lee Marvin. Tom Selleck just looks so natural in these cowboy roles, he is truly enjoyable. Isabella Rossellini is a pure joy at whatever role she plays, she is one of my favorite all time actress and she brings so much depth and joy to a role that would be wasted in a lesser actress' hands. Keith and Robert Carradine are great as always. George Eads is great as Shorty. William DeVane, Jack Palance, Wallace Shawn, James Gammon all great. The scenery is magnificent. Beautifully shot.",1468800000,,817,4.417218543046357

1886732,2,B00009N1WI,"I'm a big Tom Selleck fan - especially from his recent Jesse Stone movies and, if it weren't for him  - this movie would be a total loss.  As usual, Selleck creates a likeable character but the story, dialog and production value is subpar.

About 30 minutes into the movie you'd have no idea what the story is about unless you read the synopsis.  Despite the promise of sporadic humor in the beginning, the movie is not necessarily uplifting or rewarding at the end.  I'd never watch it again, but it's a fine way to kill a couple of hours rather than doing taxes or something.",1465948800,,577,4.40566037735849

1886735,4,B00009N1WI,"Watched MONTE WALSH - the Tom Selleck version - a couple nights ago on TV. It's a stunningly beautiful film - the color and cinematography -  and the story is a good one too, about the inevitable changes to ranching and cowboy-ing toward the end of the 19th century. Selleck and Carradine are great as a couple middle-aged cowboys trying to cope with their shrinking profession and the rapid impersonal changes brought on by corporate ranches. And Isabel Rossellini is perfect as a 'professional woman' and Selleck's love interest. (And it is positively spooky how much she now looks like her mother, Ingrid Bergman.)

I have never seen the earlier Lee Marvin version of MONTE WALSH, but now I'd kinda like to watch that one, just to compare. And I'd like to read the book too, by Jack Schaefer. I've read his most famous book, SHANE, of course, but never this one. This film is a damn good one. Highly recommended.",1465603200,,915,4.6770186335403725

1886737,5,B00009N1WI,Everything about this film is topnotch.  Tom Selleck is superb in the role of Monte Walsh.  This story can make your heart ache for the Old West and the death of a way of life that fed the free spirit of the men and women who lived it.  You don't expect people to cry when watching a Western.  But this one can do that to you.  Five stars is too low a rating for a film like this one!,1465084800,2,384,3.810126582278481

It is an awesome cowboy movie with all of the necessary elements.  The movie is a lamentation on change.  Selleck is a premiere actor who doesn't always need dialogue to communicate.  He is the best of these times in a category at the top with Duval and Hanks.  However, I am not pleased with the company from which I ordered these movies.  They did not treat me fairly.

1886760,2,B00009N1WI,Not Selleck's best roll by any stretch of the imagination. This story is so messed up you don't even see Monte Walsh as a hero or even just a good guy character.

1886784,4,B00009N1WI,"Released in 2003, Monte Walsh chronicles the mundane adventures the title character (Tom Selleck) & Chet Rollins (Keith Carradine) and other itinerant cowhands in remote Wyoming in 1892-93, with an epilogue taking place in 1900. Times are a changing as Easterners with capital are making conglomerates of the big ranches and theres not enough work for cowhands to go around. Can these old cowboys adapt to the new century? Isabella Rossellini plays Montes romantic interest while George Eads and William Devane play Shorty and Brennan respectively.

Being made-for-cable (TNT), this newer version of Jack Schaefers novel lacks the sheen of, say, 2003s Open Range, but its not far off in overall quality and shows that a superlative Western can be made on a TV-budget. Ive seen the 1970 version, but it was so long ago that I cant compare the two.

The movie starts out dull as it shows the everyday life of the cowhands, but I caught a grip with the realistic vibe and was fully immersed into the story by the second half where the story perks up. Besides the realism, I liked the palpable love displayed between Monte and his babe, as well as the subplot of desperate men doing foolish things in desperate times. Monte makes a big mistake when he lets a certain character go when hes caught rustling. He shouldve made sure he got his just deserts. The story is nigh elegiac in tone as we witness the limited opportunities for these tough Westerners as their way of life is stifled by progress. Monte Walsh is akin to similar Westerns like 1967s Will Penny, which was hampered by its subplot of cartoony villains. Monte Walsh has no such flaw.

The film runs 117 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada.

Even the way this movie starts, with Monte Walsh (Tom Selleck) sitting on the front porch of a general store eating peaches, and sitting back and stirring up trouble just for his own entertainment, is just delightful and sets the tone for this movie.  It's a great story, one of the last real cowboys and the dying out of an era.  Tom Selleck plays this role so well and this is just a great, different kind of cowboy movie.  The real cowboy, who can't settle town, can't turn in his spurs.  A very cool story and really well done.  I also loved the twist of the love story with Isabella Rossellini, who loves this big rough cowboy, but she just can't tame him because he is like the wild prairies he rides.",1421971200,,721,4.343283582089552

Tom Selleck plays an aging cowboy who loves his profession. He tells his pal, what other job lets you drive from Texas to Canada and pays you for it. He even enjoys the freezing weather and rain when caught in it so long as he can do his work on a horse. But it is 1901 and times have changed. Land is being fenced in, trains move cattle, and there is no need for cowboys. Most of Selleck's friends are put out of work. One sweeps floors. One commits suicide. Another turns to crime and murder. Selleck is offered a job in a carnival but cannot do anything else but be a cowboy. He is even unable to marry a prostitute he enjoys being with, but doesn't love, for the only thing he loves is being a cowboy. There is a heavy brooding nature to this film and little action, but it is nevertheless very good.",1417996800,,951,4.202185792349726

The visual composition of each setup is extremely pleasing. Simon Wincer, who directed this film when he was 60, has the eye and the skills of a fine artist.

1886933,2,B00009N1WI,"There were some stellar performers in this movie such as Tom Selleck, William Devane, and Isabella Rosellini but the script just fell flat in my opinion.  This could've been a good story because it was true at the time, which was the late 1890s.  As ranchers fell on hard times, bad weather, etc. they ended up selling out to a corporate entity which promptly let go a lot of the cowhands who historically drove cattle to markets or better grazing areas.  Then came the railroad, later motorized vehicles, and the cowboy's job went away.  How they coped with this loss is what this film tried to get across.  Monte(Tom Selleck) is the one they kept.  The other cowboys in the movie 1. Got married and was in business with his wife 2. Committed suicide because he got tired of ""riding fence"" 3. Committed armed robbery in order to survive. As a result of all of these careers by default a lot of people got killed.  The movie lasted almost two hours, yet there were many scenes that were rushed.  An example:  they are camped during a snow storm and then presto! it's spring.  Also sometimes it was hard to hear the dialogue.  Isabella Rosellini's role was never clear.  Was she the mistress of Monte and a kept woman?  Or did she work in the saloon?  Or was she once a prostitute?  Her role seemed to be that she was always waiting for Monte.  None of these characters really developed.  They were all shallow and one-sided.  I found this film to be a disappointement.",1364774400,3,1468,4.517110266159696

Here the stars are Tom Selleck as Monte Walsh and Keith Carradine as his cowboy buddy Chester `Chet' Rollins. Our heroes are very contented with their lives as cowboys spending most of their day in the saddle. But the 20th century is dawning with its automobiles and locomotives and this is threatening the life they love to lead. This is not a western about a greedy cattle baron wanting to run settlers off their land but a very human story about how difficult it is to adapt to change once you are settled into a particular lifestyle that you enjoy. One of the group, Frank `Shorty' Austin (George Eads), even loses his job and has to turn to rustling cattle for a living. The love interest in Monte's life is provided by `Countess' Martine Bernard (Isabella Rossellini) that Monte can never quite get around to marrying - until it's too late. Barry Corbin has a character part as Bob the storekeeper. This is not a great western but it is unusual and thereby entertaining.",1352505600,2,1067,4.591623036649215

Monte Walsh (Tom Selleck) is a lifelong cowboy who doesn't embrace the idea of investors buying up land and turning it into a business enterprise. Selleck once again performs well in his role, and carries most of the weight of the film. However, while there is old west nostalgia and traditional scenes that are the norm for westerns, the plot never seems to thicken, and at times the movie is predictable. In a lot of ways, this movie reminds me of Little House on the Prairie; it has that 'anemic' pace and passivity to it.

I found it much slower than many westerns but still almost as interesting. What was best was the cast. It fascinated me, especially being a regular viewer of the CSI shows. There are two actors whom I've gotten to know well from those shows and they have roles in here: George Eads having a major part while Rex Linn is in a lesser role. Tom Selleck as ""Monte Walsh"" is a natural for these westerns. He, like Sam Elliott, has that rugged cowboy appearance that make him look genuine. Isabella Rossellini is past her exotic days but she's always interesting as are the following: Keith Carradine, William Devane, James Gammon, Barry Corbin and Wallace Shawn. Yup, this is a very deep and diverse cast.

You also get one of the better directors doing this made-for-cable TV movie in Australian Simon Wincer, who directed ""Lonesome Dove."" Plus, the film is based on a book from Jack Schaefer (who wrote ""Shane."")

1887006,5,B00009N1WI,"This movie takes place at the end of the 1880s and captures with a resonance of realism, how the American West in the time when horses were the means of transportation, and moving stock and cattle, as well as the Frontier...passed into history.  Monte Walsh (Tome Sellect)is a stubborn old ""cowboy"" used to driving herds up North and into Canada on a horseback.  The trouble is, the 20th Century
was approaching, and there were fewer assignments to drive live cattle across vast reaches for pay.  Corporate America was making inroads into the Frontier, and all was changing rapidly for the worse. Monte Walsh is so stubborn, he can not see the Woman in front of him, portrayed by the lovely Issabella Rossellini-who makes like a  Lady of Pleasure, but comes across as a Dame waiting for the right Man to marry her- and Walsh wastes the relationship by having dinners and intimacy with this lovely Lady who wants to be his Wife, but he resists throughout the movie.  Walsh attends  his best friends' wedding, cognizant that he really should be having his own wedding with Rossellini.  Walsh misses and wastes that opportunity.  By the time, he rides of for another adventure, his best friend is murdered in a General Store hold up gone terrible- murdered by a one time friend who panicked at the trigger- and thereafter,Walsh rides out to his Lady, when alerted by an old friend that ""she's in a bad way..."".  Sadly...she has passed away ...from consumption, and Walsh arrives in time to see the Doctor confirm her death, and the scene where Monte Walsh mourns for her while she lays in her bed, is really moving... heart wrenching. This scene alone is so touching, it reminded me how we take so much for granted in life, and it will do the same to you.
The movie does not glamorize violence, and that is quite prevalent in this film.  the violences shown is a product of the circumstances as they present themselves.  The movie reminds us of what we lost by 1980 and thereafter, when the Indians were decimated and excluded from this Land that was theirs, (although it never even shows an Indian on horse back),and the horse culture was pushed out of the way for cars.  We lost a vast, beautiful Frontier, a pristine prairie, we decimated the American Indians to our great detriment, lament, and we almost killed the Buffalo into extinction, and these days, we have lost everything, even our manners!
I'm reminded by this movie, how great we were as a Frontier Nation, but how hollow and shallow we have become as the manner-less, rude, selfish , unfeeling, uncaring Americans that we are today!  Monte Walsh is a movie for all time, and conveys the message that as Americans, we have stopped caring, and protecting the things that really matter in life.  We've become emotionless, manner-less creeps, I am sorry to say, and God does not reside in us anymore.  How sad!  This is a must-see movie for all.",1198368000,2,2904,4.6982248520710055

1887023,4,B00009N1WI,"This is not a shoot-em-up Western. If that is what you are after, stop reading right here. What this is, is a real heartfelt tribute to the cowboy. The genuine article cowboy. In particular, it charts a group of cowboys through the decline of the golden age of the cowboy, near the end of the 19th Century. Almost the whole of the first half of the movie, there is no plot to speak of, just character exposition building up the picture of the life and character that these men had. Nothing is rushed, and yet it is never dull, thanks to an intelligent script. There are humorous moments and great lines, but plenty of pathos and melancholy too, as the characters all deal with the end of an era in their own ways. We see the cowboy-turned-outlaw, the cowboy-turned-storekeeper, the cowboy-turned-floor sweeper... but most of all we see the cowboy turned into legend. As the plot kicks in, there is nothing contrived about it, but it all feeds into the central idea of examining what men do when their purpose is taken away from them.

The movie benefits from some great performances from some classic character actors such as William Devane and Barry Corbin, as well as a brilliant star turn from Tom Selleck who has never been better. It also benefits from the stunning scenery - ironically not in Wyoming as the movie suggests, but shot in Canada. The sweeping vistas, free of any trace of civilization, set against a backdrop of the Rockies, are stunning and superbly photographed.

What pulls this above it's TV-movie-of-the-week origins is the sincerity poured into it by all concerned, and not least by the prolific director Simon Wincer (Lonesome Dove, Quigley Down Under... and Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles! ) and executive producer Tom Selleck. This fills the movie with those little, almost subliminal moments which make it feel real.

The result is no classic big screen film, but a perfectly judged and understated homage to a bygone era. It leaves us with the notion, that though the golden age is over, there will always be real cowboys.",1172361600,14,2054,4.780281690140845

It seemed to be just a pleasent story of one who fights progress but never resolves an answer for himself.

1887025,5,B00009N1WI,"As another man said, the plot has been explained by others pretty thoroughly, and as I went through these reviews a gentleman from Nevada put a different spin on his particular review; as a third generation cowboy he used this film to teach a city boy why he his the way he his. I didn't do that. Well, sorta.

I am a fourth generation rancher and cowhunter in Florida (used to be a top five beeve cattle state) and will be the last. Not because I lack children, but rather because in less than two decades my county has turned form ranchland to suburbs and native Crackers and cowhunters such as myself have become a small and declining minority in our own land. I have become Monte Walsh, as has just about everyone I grew up with.

I caught this film on TNT and actually welled up a little. When it came out I snatched it up and took it down to the local drinking hole on ""John Wayne Night"" (we watch a Western and toast the Duke) and convinced the bartender to put it on. She's a sucker for Selleck. I had also invited a batch of my Snowbird (PC for Yankees) pals to sit in. When the movie was over the place was real quiet, then a old timer stood up and said ""A toast to all us fence riders!"" It was a dang good toast. It was kinda quiet for the rest of the night, but everyone congratulated the choice; it summed us all up. We may be dying out, a bit bitter about it, but by God we'll go out with dignity.  As for my Northern pal's reactions, well as the Nevadan's boss said: ""Now I get it.""",1166400000,12,1497,4.11986301369863
1887026,5,B00009N1WI,"This 2003 remake of ""Monte Walsh"" was Tom Selleck's third (but hopefully not last) Western for TNT, and it is probably the most stirring film tribute to the end of the Old West and the cowboy way of life. This is saying quite a bit as some fine Westerns like ""The Wild Bunch"", ""The Shootist"", and (even more recently) ""Open Range"" as well as other movies have dealt with the changes resulting from progress as the U.S. was about to enter the twentieth century.

Other reviewers have covered the plot line in great detail already, so I won't retread that ground. Suffice it to say that, while Selleck's Monte Walsh is the hero of the picture, he is portrayed with character flaws intact as well. Montelius Walsh loves three things in life: horses, women, and drinking (and the order of these things changes at different times in his life). He is stubborn, afraid to commit to Martine (his favorite prostitute whom he does seem to love), and refuses to change. He is also hard-working and loyal to his friends, especially his best buddy Chet (played by Keith Carradine), and these qualities are what make his character heroic and the storyline affecting.

I'm convinced that if Selleck had starred primarily in Westerns throughout his film career, then his movie success would have dwarfed his ""Magnum P.I."" role. The TNT Westerns, along with his three previous Westerns dating back to 1979's ""The Sacketts"", establish him as a premier cowboy actor. ""Monte Walsh"" is the finest of those efforts to date, and it is to be hoped that Selleck will 'saddle up' again soon; perhaps he'll even reunite with Sam Elliott with whom he starred in his first two made-for-TV Westerns and who has also made some first-rate Westerns for TNT.

Watch this one. It's an elegiac tribute to the passing of the Old West and the American cowboy. May both continue to live on in films!",1162512000,4,1860,4.734567901234568

1887031,4,B00009N1WI,"Directed by Simon Wincer (LONESOME DOVE, QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER, CROSSFIRE TRAIL, INTO THE WEST), MONTE WALSH, which won the 2004 Bronze Wrangler Award for Outstanding Television Feature Film, didn't even register as a faint blip on my radar when it was first released. I'm glad that I've since come across it.

Tom Selleck, in the title role, is an aging cowboy at the turn of the 19th century. Arriving back in town after wintering on the range minding a cattle herd, Monte and his trail pardner, Chet Rollins (Keith Carradine), learn that the hard season has broken the backs of the local ranch owners and their spreads are being bought up by a consortium of Eastern dudes. Jobs are scarce, but Walsh and Rollins are hired by Cal Brennan (William Devane), a former owner now managing the consortium's local holding. Cowboys are a dying breed and, as Monte and Chet soon discover, times only get tougher as even the distant bosses can't show a profit.

Ostensibly in Wyoming but actually filmed in the gorgeous Canadian Rockies, MONTE WALSH is a bittersweet tale of a man, supremely talented in a very narrow niche, finding himself outliving his best friend (Chet), his long-time lover, the aging saloon whore ""Countess"" Martine (Isabella Rossellini), and his own ability to earn a living in the only craft he's ever known.

Except for Selleck, Carradine, and Devane, the film is populated by actors that you may not recognize, though it's good to see again Barry Corbin (Deputy Roscoe Brown in LONESOME DOVE) as Bob the Storekeeper and William Sanderson (Lippy in LONESOME DOVE, E.B Farnum in DEADWOOD, and Larry of NEWHART) as the odiferous ranch cook, Skimpy.

Perhaps the most poignant and tragic scene involves a cowboy nicknamed ""Fightin' Joe Hooker"" (James Gammon), who, at the end of his career, is relegated to ""riding fence"", i.e. stringing barbed wire to a line of fence posts stretching endlessly across the landscape - the most hated of ranch jobs. Joe got his moniker from having ridden alongside the real General ""Fightin' Joe"" Hooker at the Battle of Missionary Ridge back in '64. Now, his spirit crushed by age and lack of prospects, Joe deliberately races his mount over a precipice to their deaths. Only after his demise do the other ranch hands, while going though his meager belongings, learn that his real name was simply Albert Miller.

MONTE WALSH isn't a great film, but I enjoyed it immensely for its perspicacity regarding the end of an era in general, and the challenge confronting the individual at life's useful end in particular. At some point, I suspect, we're all faced with ""riding fence"".",1141948800,55,2621,4.8941441441441444
1887032,4,B00009N1WI,"*Spoilers*  What I learned after viewing Monte Walsh

 I believe that the movie, Monte Walsh tells me to strive for my desires and dreams because in the movie, Monte continues doing his job as a cowboy even though he lost his close friends and he continues even with technology taking his job away. However, at one point he has second thought on whether he is doing the right thing to leave his passion for being a cowboy.

I saw this movie at my father's house on DVD on September 25th 2005. I never saw or knew that this was a TV special, so the first time I saw it was on DVD. At one point I never had an intention of seeing this movie until my father recommended it, so I decided to watch it.

In the movie, it shows Monte and his friends enjoying their jobs as cowboys. However, at a point he loses his closest friends Shorty and Chip. He lost Shorty because out of all the cowboys he had the least experience in the group, so he was fired. Chip, however, left because he wanted to have a better living, so he became a hardware shop owner. This reminds me of my passion for the Japanese language. I have lost many friends who have gone on to do much better things because they thought there wasn't much work that involve the language. They might be right, but I plan on staying on track and hope to use it in my career.

Technology had put a big burden on Monte's job. With automobiles making horse obsolete and trains doing the job of moving animals much faster; the need for cowboys was decreasing. Monte didn't even like fences being built because they prevented him from going places and he wanted to travel all over the country. Even with these advancements he still continued doing his job. This was Monte's biggest difficulty to overcome, but he made it over in the end. I have also had a difficulty in my life and it was my ability to socialize. This had been a problem for me since I was really young and I wasn't able to make many friends because of it. Recently, I have been getting more social and this difficulty is starting to disappear.

When Monte lost all his friends; he had second thoughts on whether to continue his job or not. He was considering marriage and even considered an alternative job. He was worried about this decision to change, so he talked with his fiance, Martine and she told him that she would love him regardless of what job he had. After this conversation he decided that he would continue his job as a cowboy. I, too, have had second thoughts like when I was moving from my mother's house to my father's. I was constantly wondering ""is this the right choice"" and ""will I be happier over there"". In the end I made a good choice and I am glad I made the choice to live with my father.

  I believe that many people have desires that they want to go after and once they watch this film they will want to go after those dreams.",1134604800,5,2869,4.3061224489795915

I'm not usually into westerns, but I admit I watched it mainly to see him in this and I was actually glad in the end I did see it. Not too bad. Probably a very underated movie because the acting was actually fairly good.  If you like westerns and even if you don't you'll probably like this one too.",1125273600,,348,4.1940298507462686
1887035,5,B00009N1WI,"Tom Selleck portrays Monte Walsh an aging cowboy in the declining days of the Old West.  We see him face the threat to his way of life from big cattle business, railroads, and death.  All through this he is unwilling to leave or abandon the life he knows.  Having been familiar with the 70's film with Lee Marvin and Jack Palance, I was interested in watching the differences  between the two films.  There are minor differences but nothing very radical.  In some ways this version is much better than the old one.  I really enjoyed the way each film treats the relationship that Monte has with Martine. Each portrayed the love that they had together and the loss that Monte felt in her passing.  All in all a good film.  I just kept waiting for Mama Cass to sing...'The Good Times are Coming'.",1122336000,9,794,4.496503496503497
1887036,5,B00009N1WI,"One of Tom Selleck's finest pieces.  This was America as it was for the soon to be turn of the century cowboy. The west was quickly being partitioned and bought up and the railroad saw to that. Not sure what the unionist was getting at in the previous review, but this was just how it evolved, good, bad or indifferent.  Isabella Roselini still sends shivers up my spine.  So well cast and played as the lovelorn ""countess"" as Monte referred to her.  I loved her line about not having anyone to play with in the snow.  Down and dirty, real life transition of the old to new west.  Monte Walsh will allways be a favorite.",1113868800,8,620,4.3478260869565215

This is the story of Monte Walsh, last of the cowboys.  ""If I was starvin' I wouldn't rustle,"" says Monte.  But, ""This is the twentieth century"" it was explained to him, and cowboyin' for a livin' is on its way out.  Monte is in love with a little French girl, a ""Lady of the Evening"" who has tuberculosis, often fatal in those days.  Offered a job in a Wild West Show, under a pseudonym, he refuses.  ""I ain't spittin' on my whole life,"" says Monte.

This is a wonderful movie, with a deep sense of realism.  It's about the age-old story of men outliving their vocation, which happens just about every generation to some group.

One of the best films I've ever seen.

1887038,3,B00009N1WI,"This remake of the 1970 movie of the same name starring Tom Selleck is not immediately what you are likely to expect, after about 15 mins into the picture. Set at the turn of the 19th century, Selleck plays the title role as a true cowboy, slowly realising that he is rapidly becoming an anachronism, to the ever evolving world around him. Unhappy with what he sees more and more, he comes to take a stand against the faceless Eastern companies threatening the very fabric of his World, in heroic, but not typical fashion, and this essentially sets up our story. Hardly action packed, and more than a few dry screen moments mean however, that Selleck really has to work hard to maintain the flow of the story, but he does so with a depth of character and credibility that is accomplished to say the least. This is probably not a movie you will sit around and talk about for hours, and will ceratinly be more popular with dedictaed fans of the genre, rather than a more mainstream audience. All that aside, this is a good movie, with some great acting. that unfortunately that just misses the mark.",1083801600,6,1097,4.545454545454546
1887049,5,B00009N1WI,"I hate cowboys movies, but I felt in love with this movie. TOm Selleck plays a real cowboy, the last cowboy who doesn't change when everything around him is changing.
It has a great views and some really funny moments also, but what I really most liked about this movie is the way the love is in it.
You must see this movie.... Selleck's finest hour.",1079568000,9,350,4.318181818181818
1887050,5,B00009N1WI,"I start this by telling the reader that, if it is a western, I'll most likely watch it.  If it is a western staring Tom Seleck or John Wayne, let me at it.  Just so you know my bias.
This movie was not nearly as good as the book that fostered it.  ""Monte Walsh"" by Mr. Jack Schaefer is no less than a monument to the American Cowboy.  His characters are timeless.  When you finsh the book, you will feel that you have lived for a bit in those wonderful times.
Mr. Seleck and crew did a laudable job in presenting the story of Monte.  Due to the very limitation of the film industry, they could not present the book.  But, they did well.  The clothing and gear that they used was spot on.  Seleck caught the essence of Monte so very well.  Mr Carradine did the same as Chet Rollins, Monte's long time friend.  Were I able to, I would stand each to a drink.
This movie and the book that spawned it touts the best in mankind; individuality, decency, a sense of fairness, loyalty, and friendship.  If people don't like this movie for some picky reason, well, you just can't believe how much I don't care.",1078963200,11,1100,4.235576923076923
1887051,4,B00009N1WI,"Then you must watch the original 1970 Movie staring Lee Marvin and Jack Palance. I am a big Selleck fan..and love almost all of his Westerns. An old timer told me that the original was his favorite Western of all time....and he was a bit miffed that Selleck had gone and remade it. We agreed to swap versions. And I must say I do like the old version. Sellecks was very true to the first one..and the theme and atmosphere come across in both. I am awaiting the review from the other end..but I am more certain he will find it does justice to a great story.
The Lee Marvin Monte is only available in tape...at least I have not seen it released in DVD yet.

1887053,4,B00009N1WI,"Tom Selleck has made his living with western films lately and this is a nice addition.  Selleck is a believable cowboy and may one day be remembered best for roles like this
Monte Walsh, a cowboy's cowboy!  He's the guy all of us boys wanted to be.  The best of Bronc Busters.  Witty and intelligent. Tough as nails.  Fast and accurate with a gun.  Loyal to his friends.
Monte's goal in life was simple.  He wanted to drive cows from Texas to Canada and get paid for it, if at all possible.  Unfortunately for Monte and the other range riders, the modern era is fast upon them.  Eastern corporations have begun to buy up the range and jobs are scarce.  Bespectacled, bowler topped accountants assume they know how to manage the cow business, while the likes of Monte, Chet, and Shorty swallow dust day to day.
There is an interesting story line here and its fairly easy to follow.  There is a little unnecessary language and some suggestive adult relationships to take away any opportunity to make this a good family film, but altogether tame compared to most. The show is nicely photographed and vivid in every way.  If the truth is told, the story isn't nearly as important as the acting and the portrayal of the West we've dreamed about.",1070236800,9,1240,4.5610859728506785

1887055,5,B00009N1WI,"Such a rarity to see a story told with with respect. It was a joy viewing this movie and not having your intelligence or heritage insulted, with insane anti-Western P.C. foul scenes and lines added, for no reason other than for Bolshevik anti-Western reasons.. This movie was worth every one of my hard earned dollars I spent on it. I do not have cable because of what is on it to me is so sophomoric,and in my opinion is damaging to family and Western Cilvilization. I want to thank Tom Selleck for telling a story that entertained, and also caused one to ponder lifes serious side too, yet had some laughs and smiles, that is so needed in these times. No I am not connected to this movie or the movie business in any way, these are my honest opinions, but if your like me and only buy a very few movies in year, and hate being ripped off, here is a DVD movie you will feel good about and reflective about the story too, this one is worth the purchase. Tom Selleck also did this movie out his own pocket too, from what I read. He is a good man.. Enjoy this one friends..",1063152000,37,1071,4.229268292682927
1887056,4,B00009N1WI,"This remake of the all time great ""future shock"" western is very good but the original with Lee Marvin and Jack Palance was better.  The original movie had Momma Cass Eliot on the soundtrack with the haunting melody ""The good times are coming"" which played well in the story line.  Why doesn't someone put the original out on DVD remastered for quality?  Still, especially if you haven't seen the original, Selleck plays the lead role well albeit the ending, which deviates radically from the original, is a bit corny.",1060819200,2,518,4.797752808988764

There is a delightful mix of realism and moments of laughter amongst the grittiness of life in the saddle. This movie is an excellent opportunity for a writer of westerns to get a feel of the times.
