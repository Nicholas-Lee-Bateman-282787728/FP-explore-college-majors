8410830,5,B003ZSI6RI,"It helped me to understand how best to support a loved one with bipolar.  Dr. Jay is amazing.  Real, honest, open and he cuts to the quick.  His 8 hour seminar was reduced to two sentences.  Powerful and full of information.  The dance reveals the emotions and the song from the sister was heartfelt.",1427328000,,300,4.481481481481482

8410834,4,B003ZSI6RI,"Dr. Carter helps us all to remember that bipolar disease is not about us, is not a choice and is worth thinking about. It helped me thinking about and working with both patients and family members.",1375228800,,197,4.5
8410835,5,B003ZSI6RI,Purchased this video after renting and watching so I could watch it again whenever I want to. Very Informative and down to earth approach. Recommend for anyone trying to understand bipolar disorder.  All the latest best expert scientific information doesn't help anyone unless it gets to them in a understandable usable way. This seminar does it. Found myself laughing out loud at this guy - yes he's smart and funny and an expert on bipolar disorder. The bipolar monster can wreak havoc in people's lives but laughter's great medicine too. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because that's as high as it goes! Watch it!,1367193600,,622,4.7592592592592595
8410836,4,B003ZSI6RI,"This is an excellent, thorough and comprehensive summary of a condition that can be devastating to people that love people with bi-polar disorder.

The information is presented well and throughout the content you just keep saying ""yes, that's what it's like"" or Oh, now that explains something else that happens.

The knowledge brings comfort in that you aren't completely dealing with so many ""unknowns"" anymore.  Wonderful to have this insight.",1348185600,,446,5.3428571428571425
8410837,5,B003ZSI6RI,"Jay Carter enlightens the viewers about what bipolar disorder is and how it looks in patients through an informative and ""easy to understand"" lecture. He also utilizes the talents of a dancer to display mania and depression and a young woman who sang a song she composed related to her experiences with a family member with bipolar disorder. He was able to educate and entertain an audience and speaking for myself, shed light on this disorder while challenging some myths. Very well done, I would highly recommend it for my own patients, their families and anyone who is interested in this topic.",1282608000,2,597,4.862745098039215
