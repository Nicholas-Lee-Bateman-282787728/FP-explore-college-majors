8183044,5,B000HDZJWE,"I watched this movie today with my girlfriend, and we had sex twice during the movie! Good sign! It means that it was very appealing to both of us, there are few movies that really turn us on (toghether), this is one! There are no actual XXX scenes but the movie is very well made and we didn't miss the XXX action (which we usually do miss in an erotic movie). The story is good, the actresses and the actor very attractive, the sex scenes turned in a very intense way, the acting is really good (apart from some supporting actresses, but who cares?), not to much pubic & other hair (being the 70's), I highly recommend it!
The only thing that bothered us was the ""shhhhh"" backroung noise, but you can live with it, just keep the TV remote handy to adjust the volume...",1215734400,5,770,4.317241379310345
8183045,3,B000HDZJWE,"I was tired of nobody reviewing this movie, so I bought it for the sole reason to watch it and write a review.  I was intrigued by the ""X"" rating.  I thought to myself ""X means porn, but Amazon doesn't sell porn"".  After hearing about Rebecca Brooke's performance in ""The Image"" I thought she might be more of the hardcore type.  And the cover art looks inticing, to say the least.  Sadly if you're watching this movie to see the good stuff you might be disapointed.  The women in this film are beautiful, even by today's standards.  One even looks just like Ashley Simpson (the one that can't sing).  My favorite is the brunette on the cover who plays the lover for the main male and female characters.  The sex in this film is real.  I watched the interview with the director to confirm.  There were scenes of lesbianism, as well as real man-humps-chick action.  The problem is that when the action starts the camera moves above the waist.  The director says it's more erotic to show the sex without really showing the sex.  In the end it'll leave you wanting to see more, and I must say I think some of the previews were hotter to watch.  And that's my review.",1174262400,47,1163,4.419811320754717
