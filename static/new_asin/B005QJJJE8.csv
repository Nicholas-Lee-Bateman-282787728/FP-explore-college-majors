8483449,1,B005QJJJE8,"I had seen the movie when it was first released and was looking forward to seeing it again.  Story and acting are just as good as I remembered.  However, the quality of the DVD was extremely poor.  The sound was so bad we were lucky to understand more than one or two words in a sentence.  Also, the picture quality was terrible -- pixels dancing around.  We watched it all the way through hoping it would improve, and it did for about the last 15 to 20 minutes.  I haven't contacted the secondary seller as it just arrived the end of last week, and we watched it last night.",1390780800,,575,4.229357798165138

8483451,4,B005QJJJE8,This movie was based on Ernest K. Gann's book of the same title I believe this was the first of his books to made into a film.  Worth watching story line is pretty much like the book.,1377302400,,183,3.945945945945946
8483452,3,B005QJJJE8,"blaze of noon is one my favorite ernie gann books. the movie could have been much better,considering it was directed by john farrow and starred William holden,ann baxter,william bendix,and sterling hayden. the flying by paul mantz is awesome.many movies filmed before 1950 have been lost forever due to the degredation of nitrocellulose film.this movie has a notable fuzzy look and the audio quality is less than ideal,however,i am happy that it still exists and I have a copy",1374537600,,476,5.115384615384615
8483453,4,B005QJJJE8,"Anybody who reads about aviation has read books by Earnest K. Gann. And the reader understands flight just a bit better after each story, whether a licensed pilot or not. Any story by Ernie Gann is worth the reading. And Hollywood thinks a lot of his books are worth making a movie from...a very big movie with lots of publicity...usually. ""Fate Is the Hunter"","" Island In the Sky"",""The High and the Mighty"" are three that fill this description. Blaze of Noon also.  became a film, but didn't get the great hype of the other three...it was made in 1947, in a world that was a bit weary of war movies and no national TV publicity yet, so it did not garner a great publicity program. The studio did commission Paul Mantz to paint Blaze of Noon on the fuselage of his Bendix Air Race Red and white P-51 for the 1947 race. And there were movie billboards and radio interviews with principal stars Bill Holden, Sonny Tufts, and Sterling Hayden. The movie was good, but never went into re-release. It went to TV in the late 1950s through the 1970s, the disappeared. Too bad. I find it to be a great little story...perhaps that's the problem, it's a little story, not on a grand scale like the other Gann efforts.
 The story is of the birth and developmental growth of commercial aviation in the 1920s, through the life stories of the four MacDonald Brothers, barnstormers who find their audiences dwindling and dangers in the show growing. They decide to take jobs as pilots for a small commercial air line trying to introduce flying as a business to a growing and modernizing nation. Marriages, crash injuries, recklessness outgrown, and fatal accidents take the brothers out of the picture as the story of the slow success of the commercial aviation industry go forward. Aside from the reality of the history, there is solid acting from Holden and Hayden, good acting by Tufts, and the usual by William Bendix, a character inserted for comic relief, I guess.
 The aircraft used in the film are, if not the actual correct type, a credible replica or a good process shot model for flying scenes, by 1947 special effects standards. The B&W copy quality is sharp, making me wonder how it would have looked in Technicolor had their budget allowed. The dialog and historic placement and location of events is spot on for the era. I had the great fortune of finding an original first edition book of this story, and it's almost a word for word, scene for scene transformation from print to motion picture image.
 If you like airplanes, aviation and historical fiction and literature, and any of the stars, this is for you.",1370563200,2,2611,4.6695652173913045
