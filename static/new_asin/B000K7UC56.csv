8154931,2,B000K7UC56,"This is a review for the DVD, not the drummer. I do enjoy Sorum's style and I like the music G&R put out and his contribution to the band.

However this DVD is very weak, and has no direction. I feel it is important to hit the target audience for a program like this. If it is intended for beginners, then speak on their level, or more advanced drummers, speak on that level. Sorum brings in his drum tech and they go over drum set up, tuning and mic placements, which are important, but they do not go in depth enough for a beginner to really understand, and it really is not a necessary topic for a seasoned player.

Another weak moment is Sorum is explaining about building a groove around the quarter note (which is very important for any drummer of any skill level) But he just counts it off and starts playing, standard time, half time, and double time, WITHOUT A CLICK TRACK! How can you say play with a click, and demonstrate it without the click?! Weak! (and his time was off in the double time groove)

The next section is ""left hand free"" as he calls it. He is showing how to use the left hand (for right handed players) for more than just the back beat on the snare. Again, great topic, however he just shows how to move the left foot to play the hi hat and bass (double pedal) and then plays a groove with his left hand moving around the set. No real explanation or break down for beginners, and no real depth for advanced drummers.

Again, nothing against Matt Sorum as a drummer, but not the best DVD to learn anything from or grow as a drummer or musician.",1350691200,3,1572,4.26510067114094
