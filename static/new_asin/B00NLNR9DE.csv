6667073,5,B00NLNR9DE,"This documentary blows the ""Report of the 9/11 Commission"" right into the trash can, where it belongs.  The 9/11 Commission was a multi-million dollar farce, and this video shows how the federal government was the ""only"" entity that had the means, the opportunity, and the motive to destroy the Twin Towers, bomb the Pentagon, and blame it on Osama Bin laden.  Why?  To rain havock on the USA and invoke the Patriot Act!",1415836800,21,420,4.726027397260274

I'm givng it to all my family and friends as a
Christmas gift.
  There is one woman here in Eugene, Oregon
that is giving out the dvd to all our elected officials

theaters (an independent one.)
  You cannot watch this documentary and have
any doubts that 9/11 was an inside job.",1413244800,28,365,4.246376811594203
6667075,5,B00NLNR9DE,"As one who has read extensively about 911 and have known since 2004 that it was conceived, planned and perpetrated by individuals within the Bush administration, I did not learn anything new about those terrible events. Having said that, I strongly recommend it. David Hooper shares his agonizing reappraisal of his world view by detailing how he was forced to confront the overwhelming evidence that the official explanation of the events of 911 is an infantile fairy story. I believe it is this intensely personal aspect that is the chief strength of the documentary. It is to be hoped that a great many people who just couldn't bring themselves to accept the evidence will be helped over this enormous emotional hurdle by David Hooper's film.

The implications of 911 are every bit as disturbing as the events themselves. Not least is the fact that we are routinely lied to by our 'free' media. Most shocking for me has been the pernicious role of the BBC in actively attempting, by its 'conspiracy files', to maintain the control of what we think we know. George Orwell was indeed a prophet.

For anyone who has any lingering doubts or wishes to know more, I highly recommend the 3-DVD set ""September 11:  The New Pearl Harbor"" by Massimo Mazzucco, also available at Amazon. In 5 hours, it thoroughly eviscerates the official story and reveals the corporate media to be actively complicit in the cover-up of mass murder.",1412553600,31,1424,4.851851851851852
6667076,5,B00NLNR9DE,"I am a New Yorker and an American. I could not figure out why those kooks said that 9/11 was an inside job. My mind couldn't wrap itself around that for one second. This movie challenged everything I believe:  it is shown not just in words, but with images that told me undeniably that it was time for me to update my beliefs. The filmmaker looked for and found key footage that challenges what I learned in school, what I read in the papers, what I have seen on the news everyday. I'm not afraid of a challenge, and after watching this documentary, I'm better for having done it. The most important documentary I have ever witnessed.",1412208000,49,634,4.418803418803419
8678894,5,B00NLNR9DE,"As a physicist it was obvious to me what happened the day it happened, and in fact the news was speculating along the same obvious lines too...many Americans are familiar with what a demolition looks like, so the news could be related to by many.  The very next day, however, the news changed dramatically with some nonsensical idea about fire being responsible for these hugely massive steel and concrete buildings turned into thousands of tons of truck-length pieces of structural steel and millions of yards of concrete into dust.  Amazing how people have accepted such ridiculous trash, where to have enough sense to disagree somehow means one is a ""conspiracy nut""?!?
There are many good documentaries on the truth behind these demolitions, but they are either fragmented or too dry to the layperson.  This film has a true, human story line that is effectively used to introduce the various concepts along the way to a coherent picture at the end.  This is not a pleasant subject, and many people avoid it.  You owe it to yourself to know some truth of this most important event of the 21st century so far, especially in light of all the deception and warfare that has happened ever since.

8678895,5,B00NLNR9DE,"There are LOTS of videos on youtube of eyewitnesses talking ON CAMERA about hearing/feeling EXPLOSIONS. Yet NIST was like 'Nah, we don't need to look into the possibility that explosions were used. Even though three buildings -- one NOT hit by a plane -- came down exactly like controlled demolitions -- and even though terrorists DID drive a BOMB into the WTC once before to try and take it down!!!""  David Hooper is only ONE voice in many, many voices saying they smell a rat. So if HIS video is wrong/misleading -- then so are LOTS of other videos.

8678897,4,B00NLNR9DE,"Good starter film for those who have preferred to keep their head buried in the sands of the official story of events, out of fear of understanding that the government has preferred to cover up, rather than unearth the truth. This film doesn't provide all the answers. Those, we may never know. It does, however, ask some of the right questions, look at some of the evidence, and inquire why official investigators neglected a more scientific and forensic approach to the crime scene and witness testimony. The film questions without shocking those sensitive souls who've hoped and wanted to believe in American ideals, while slowly opening their eyes to the fact that it is always good to question and question more. In the words of I-don't-know-who, 'Read everything, believe nothing', 'Not all experts will tell you the truth', and I.F.Stone 'All governments lie', as does most of the Press. Once more and more people wake up to these basic premises, they will still be manipulated, but maybe less so. It's time to stop all the deceptions.",1491264000,4,1042,4.926136363636363
8678898,4,B00NLNR9DE,"A powerful, highly personal look at one person's journey away from the official 9/11 story.

8678902,1,B00NLNR9DE,"I found ""The Anatomy of a Great Deception"" to be very interesting indeed. On the one hand, David Hooper recognizes that, on 9/11/2001, the World Trade Center towers were struck by airliners hijacked by Islamic extremists. The back story of Hooper's struggle to understand inconsistencies in the official narrative regarding the terrorist attack is very compelling, and his asking of an innocent question is, in fact, very likely the way that many began their quest for truth about the events of that day. On the other hand, while Hooper comes across as a sincere seeker of truth, much of what he says is scientifically inaccurate and much of the evidence he cites is either grossly exaggerated, intentionally misrepresented, contradicted by evidence he conceals or, in a few cases, materially altered in an attempt to deceive his audience. Following are a few examples of what I am referring to:

David Hooper claims that pre-planted demolition charges, suspiciously not mentioned in the official government reports, were present in the World Trade Center buildings and somehow set to explode as the airliners impacted. As evidence, he presents an audio recording made by a Ginny Carr, who was recording a business meeting in another building near the Trade Center on the morning of September 11, 2001. In the recording there can be heard two distinct crashing sounds approximately nine seconds apart, the second of which is considerably louder than the first. David Hooper tells us that the first crashing sound is a bomb going off in the basement of the WTC North Tower and the second is the plane crash. However, in the original recording (available at 9/11 Internet archive sites), the first crashing sound is actually somewhat louder than the second, and the scream of approaching jet engines can be heard before the first crash sound. It is clear, therefore, that the filmmaker cut off the beginning of the recording so as to conceal the sound of the approaching airplane, and tampered with the sound levels so as to make the second crashing sound louder giving the false impression that it was the plane impact. Based on the height at which Flight 11 impacted the building and the nine-second delay, the second crashing sound was most likely from elevator equipment, building rubble and/or aircraft wreckage falling and impacting the bottom of elevator shafts.

In another example of misrepresentation of evidence, a NIST computer simulation of the collapse of Building 7 is shown where the building facade appears to crumple like tissue paper as it collapses rather than remain relatively intact, as seen in the video record. However, NIST conducted two global collapse simulations for Building 7, one that included damage due to debris impact from the collapse of the WTC North Tower, and one that did not include such damage. The simulation with debris impact damage closely resembles the actual recorded collapse event. The simulation shown in the film is the other one that differs significantly from actual events. David Hooper presents the wrong collapse simulation thereby giving the false impression that NIST scientists are either incompetent or trying to pull a fast one.

David Hooper also misleads his audience by concealing evidence that contradicts his theories. For example, the falling of the east mechanical penthouse of WTC Building 7 is shown only once in the film, but the seven second delay before the start of global collapse is not shown. In fact, virtually every depiction of the collapse of Building 7 in the film starts at the beginning of global collapse, when the north facade begins its descent, and is presented without a soundtrack. The reason for this is obvious. The falling of the east penthouse, the seven second delay before the start of global collapse, and the utter absence of explosion sounds are contraindicative of intentional demolition, and completely consistent with the official explanation of the collapse mechanics.

It can also be irrefutably proven that video and photographic evidence is systematically misrepresented in the film. A prime example of this is when the filmmaker presents a still photo credited to the NYPD, that appears to show smoke emanating from the south side of the lobby level of the WTC South Tower. Hooper snidely informs the audience that the photo was obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology under the Freedom of Information Act (as if to infer it was only released reluctantly) and that it shows an unreported explosion in the lobby that occurred after the airliner crashed into the building. However, other photos taken on the same roll of film and part of the same FOIA release, clearly show that the smoke was actually coming from a white van parked on Liberty Street in front of the Marriott Hotel more than 200 feet from the South Tower. The van was one of several vehicles damaged or set ablaze by falling wreckage and/or burning jet fuel from Flight 175. The filmmaker had judiciously selected and chose to present the one photo from the film roll where the burning van is concealed behind a pedestrian bridge and where the smoke appears to be coming from the World Trade Center building in the background. Incidentally, photos on the NYPD film roll also show an undamaged (and not burning) South Tower lobby. A slideshow of all photos in the FOIA release can be viewed on YouTube by searching for ""NIST FOIA 09-42 Release 4 / 42A0003-3of3 - 1/2"" and ""NIST FOIA 09-42 Release 4 / 42A0003-3of3 - 2/2"".

There can be no excuse for distortions and fabrications such as those described above in a supposed documentary presented by an individual who claims to be seeking justice for the families of the 9/11 victims and who insinuates that the United States Government is responsible for their suffering. If I were one of the many financial backers listed in the closing credits, I would demand my money be returned and then quickly distance myself from those responsible for this mockery.",1441929600,8,6001,5.021084337349397
