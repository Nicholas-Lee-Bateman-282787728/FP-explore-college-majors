8255863,5,B0014IZT8U,"Great series by one of the world's best BJJ practitioners to date. Translated and easy to understand, Marcelo does a great job at starting with a base technique, and then working from that position to transition to others. One of the best BJJ instructional DVDs that I've ever seen. Worth the $.",1461110400,,295,4.6923076923076925
