8150954,5,B000JJRYCO,He's back!!! The Maryland Muscle Machine (M3)!!! This video is both informative and funny. I enjoy watching Mr. Levrone and his training partner showing how they work each body part while having fun. Bodybuilding doesn't have to be painful and boring. The end credits are even funny. It's great seeing M3 back in the day and today.,1479686400,,331,4.824561403508772

8150956,1,B000JJRYCO,"Imagine one person saying to their best freind, ""Here's a video camera.  Shoot me doing what I do in a typical day.""  This DVD felt like that.  It had an amateurish quality.  It is meant for viewers who really want to get buff, not for domain-mastering viewers.  Levrone shows that his name has three syllables, in true Italian style.  He shows off his huge arms, but never once appears shirtless or in a posing strap.  In Jay Cutler's DVDs, his wife is all over the place; Levrone thanks his wife in the credits, but she is never shown.  Levrone visits his mother's grave and it reminded me of when Madonna visited her mother's grave in ""Truth or Dare.""  Every sentence out of Levrone's and his buddy's mouths ends ""baby"" and ""bro.""  Levrone does mentoring work with children, which I love.  However, I am gravely concerned that few children of color seemed to be around to benefit from this mentor or color.",1263340800,2,909,4.583850931677019
