8410777,1,B003ZSHMC8,"Well, I have tried to play it on Christmas, and found out that our DVD player wouldn't accept it. We tried to make it eligible for the player, but my brother said it couldn't be done! I'll just have to find a different way to get Mr. Bean's Christmas on DVD because it is one of my favorite movies of Christmas time.",1438905600,,316,4.112903225806452

8410779,3,B003ZSHMC8,"I LOVE Mr. Bean, but be careful when buying this from the UK... I couldn't get it to work on my DVD player.  I had to change the country code settings on my computer in order to watch it, and the computer warned me that I can only change the settings back and forth 5 times before they are set for good.  The DVD was fine one I got it to play, but I'm pretty bummed that I will only be able to watch it a couple of times!",1421020800,,421,3.7191011235955056
