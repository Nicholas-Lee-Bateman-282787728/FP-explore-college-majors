3622383,3,B001GZWPMO,"The 2 DVD set of attending birth is a helpful resource for natural childbirth educators and families considering homebirth. My favorite part was Luna- a short video, set to music, of an underwater birth.

The other parts are helpful, but perhaps a bit slow at times.",1233705600,,266,4.782608695652174
3622384,4,B001GZWPMO,"This is a set of 2 dvds, one which is about the evdience of homebirth being safer than hospital, along with some extra birth footage. The other dvd is all about homebirth, and explores the edivence and scientific facts of birth outcomes, experts, mothers and birth professionals comment about home birth. Very lovely...although the footage coul be more entertaining with better editing and perhaps more music. Over all great informational films. Would recommend to all people expecting a child, or considering a homebirth. Peace on Earth begins with birth!",1226016000,,556,5.258426966292135
8307566,4,B001GZWPMO,"Great video for people having their first baby and not sure which road to take ie home birth/natural birth/hospital or centre birth. This film covers everything from dangers of medical intervention through to benefits of skin to skin and reasons why we need to feel pain in labour. It was really gently worded and was not anti hospital or obstetricians but said they have their place in an emergency circumstance only. Midwives were highly praised in this film as the most appropriate health professional to be with a woman through labour. There were about 4 actual births shown but with music or talking over them so it was not intense, two births has children present. It would be an appropriate film to show to siblings expecting a baby,b with supervision and explanations of course.
All up this was a really nice film about the normality of birth and its place in the natural order of life!",1286928000,,894,4.737179487179487
8307567,5,B001GZWPMO,"Watching this made me want to have a kid despite the fact that I am not expecting one...yet.

There is so much information out there for women,,n for men too....about home birth that America has not heard of! there are some interesting stats in here that prove that we really do need to change how we think about birth... Some things that I had questions about with regards to home birth were answered here, and I thank God I've gotten t watch this before having my own children.

True to say, my fear of home birth is gone now! and I can't wait to bring my little ones into this world! The VERY NATURAL way..  :)",1277424000,,613,4.267241379310345
8307568,5,B001GZWPMO,"Birth is the most sacred and wonderful miracle of life, attending it is the greatest honor and privilege anyone can have.
Too bad many rush to hospitals and fear not going through it except with the presence of a doctor and an obstetrician. Not to lessen their importance, not at all, we need them very much, especially during complications and high risk births. But it is a shame most women don't just stay at home in their natural cozy environment with their beloved families and a well trained midwife and/or doula.

They talk about mortality rates and dangers, well, statistics prove that it is so much safer to bring a healthy baby to this world at home naturally.
Fearing labor pains and insisting on useless epidurals make things worse. It slows the labor and then there are needs for other drugs to re-accelerate it making contractions even much more painful.
There are so many other benefits for homebirths and disadvantages of hospital births, I advise all to watch this amazing documentary to discover them; I cannot impose my opinion but you can hear what people who experienced it would tell you and even watch breathtaking images of couples in waterbirth scenes and realize how much happier and safer these mothers are.

Some women also feel better during waterbirth, and ever since Igor Charkovsky introduced it in the 60s, it is used more and more often.  It's a perfect way to relax in labor.
There are discussions whether it is better to use a regular cheap kiddy pool or rent a special expensive birth pool or in a bath tub or in the ocean or so on.  Well, as long as the water is warm enough, and as long as the valiant laboring mother is comfortable and moving at her ease comforted by her beloved husband and family who try their best to sooth her pains and encourage her, it will work and is safe in any case.
Many boil water and dip a piece of cloth or towel in it to put it on the dilating vagina to reduce the pains a bit, or some use some other ancient but effective and secure methods. Being in water leads to the same results and it also reduces some back pains because the lower body is submerged.

Even if it sounds a bit strange, a cow trough can be used!
It is some sort of tub which can be filled with water and can be accommodated so that the women can be comfortable in it.  So why not also use it if you want to?

Thanks for the mothers allowing us to attend, even if not personally, their wonderful births.
It is so inspiring to watch them, all expecting mothers will surely be encouraged by this video.",1239580800,,2541,4.451612903225806
8307569,5,B001GZWPMO,"A must for pregnant woman.  If you want a natural birth in a hospital you have to have an advocate with you these days or the ""professionals"" take over and you have a typical institutional birth, with a 38% chance of cesaerean.  This explores other possibilities and helps you take control of your birth.",1239235200,,304,4.611111111111111
8307570,5,B001GZWPMO,"""Attending Birth"" is really several separate videos.  Each segment is different, but collectively they dispel the mystery surrounding birth and remove the fear and popular myths and cultural stereotypes our society seems to attach to birth.  Each segment is refreshing in its own way.  The interview with Jenine Tgettis is perhaps my favorite -- her calm and ingenuous description of giving birth, 3 days earlier, to the daughter she is nursing as she speaks, is simply arresting.  ""Evidence-Based Childbirth"" is a welcome breath of common sense, and Dr. Marsden Wagner is a kick!  For anyone interested in birth, ""Attending Birth"" is a ""must"" see.",1238630400,,648,5.1923076923076925
8307571,5,B001GZWPMO,"As a 21 year old, I was really surprised to learn about the facts on the birth practices in the United States. It made me think a lot about birth and how most women of my age are scared of birth, but with this film and others, I realized that birth isn't a scary event. I'm also from the St. Louis area and know many kids who were delivered by Dr. Duhart, who's interviewed in the film. I learned this last week that Dr. Duhart passed away, and so I hope that his practices aren't lost. Thank goodness Dr. Duhart is documented here.  (He's on the ""Home Birth:  The Spirit, The Science, The Mother"" disc). Overall, I'm just like wow, at the whole film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1238457600,,666,4.362903225806452
8307572,5,B001GZWPMO,"As an educator, I like to come to a subject from many different angles.  This is the perfect video for entertaining different views about homebirth.  There are six short but complete chapters on two discs.  My favorite is LUNA which is only 7 minutes and shows an absolutely elegant waterbirth.  Thank you for making this wonderful video available.  Every doula, childbirth educator and midwife should have at least one copy.",1238457600,,425,5.014285714285714
8307573,1,B001GZWPMO,"Am I ever sorry I took the word of earlier reviewers and spent scarce resources on this unfortunate effort by people who didn't know they didn't know how to make a good documentary.  The qualities they saw had to be in their eyes only.  There's way too much talking by the ""experts"". It's repetitious, contradictory, hyperbolic, self-serving and numbing overall.

There's hardly any footage of actual birthing and some super-amateurish moments like a woman baring her pregnant form against a background that prominently features a toilet, and an unknown woman on half the screen jabbering about her unassisted births, above a background of crashing waves, as the credits zip by on the other half of the screen.  Even the relatively short ""Cow Trough"", meant to be amusing, is too drawn out (and stupid).

None of the content is really bad (except the toilet scene and the physician categorically proclaiming that naturally birthed babies are pink when they emerge).  Skillful editing to reduce the overall viewing time by half might turn this material into something worthwhile.  As it is, this two DVD set gets a zero from me because I can't use any of it or recommend it to anyone.

A much better DVD that covers the same ground with grace, accessibility and inspiration is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orgasmic-Birth/dp/B001NY6YPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orgasmic Birth</a>.",1236729600,,1426,5.509174311926605
8307574,3,B001GZWPMO,"Attending Birth should be seen by all childbirth educators, providers and moms to be. The birth stories and videos of the moms giving birth are beautiful, amazing, and show clearly the way birth was and is created to be. The birth professionals and experts, Dr. Wagner, Robbie Davis Floyd give personal experiences with birth and information that somehow the Western world chooses to forget regarding the creation of life.
This should not be missed.

Yes, Love Delivers and we should let women birth their babies with loving support, all our help and happiness.
