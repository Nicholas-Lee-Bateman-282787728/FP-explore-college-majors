8421099,3,B004AXJ9H8,It's Tina and that makes it OK. The concert is from a television special and has been butchered to fit the allotted time. There are several other great releases of Tina in concert that allow you to experience what a Tina Turner concert should be.,1417996800,,246,4.488888888888889

8421101,1,B004AXJ9H8,I was going to purchase this DVD but not after reading Brandon's comment about this not being the original concert but a remake of someone filming it.. I would like the original concert on DVD if it ever becomes available.. Thanks,1366761600,,230,4.634146341463414
8421102,1,B004AXJ9H8,"I jumped on this video anticipating a new remaster of the Private Dancer Live Tour Concert of 1985 (which is the program actually presented on this video) but received what appeared to be a DVD copy of an old VHS tape.  I already had a somewhat sharper copy of this concert on a laser disc (the large optical format that died out some years ago) but I was hoping for a much better rendition on a new DVD.  This concert was shot on film rather than video, and the original elements have high resolution that could support a high definition video disc if somebody would just put it all together.  The original audio recording of this concert was also quite good.  The concert itself featured Tina when she was really on fire at the beginning of her comeback, and a high definition remastering of that event would beautifully present one of the best stage performers of all time at her absolute peak.  Is anybody with access to the original film and audio elements listening?",1308528000,10,972,4.563218390804598
