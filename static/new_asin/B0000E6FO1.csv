8002113,2,B0000E6FO1,"The booklet would be just fine. I mean the exercises are perfectly fine.

But, first: the DVD starts with one of those long-winded show-off displays of instructor abilities that are not tabbed at all and, because of this, remain absolutely useless. This is very picky of me but just at the beginning he says something like: this first exercise has three parts which must be done for 1.5 minutes each. It then makes a total of 6 minutes. I thought 3 times 1.5 was 4.5. Mmmm. Not too bad though, I can live with that.

Second, I've only gone through the first module of practice and although the exercises are all good, the DVD technology is overtly ignored. Which means: you don't get the chance to loop the very exercise and must painfully listen to the instructor telling you how strong your fingers are going to get and other encouraging stuff again and again (not too many useful explanations there). You usually get two speeds for practice: one is unusable(only PART of the exercise is played so as to give an idea, not as something you can practice over)and the other sppeed is utterly unusable because of how fast the instructor plays (he's probably been through these routines for decades).

The booklet itself (a few printed pages) and a few explanations would achieve even better effects than the whole DVD.

Exercises like these are all over the Net. If you need this kind of show-off to believe in your instructor or are too overwhelmed to start practicing with strength exercises from the Internet, this DVD is for you",1160092800,7,1530,4.697761194029851

It's one of a number of Rock House Method DVD's I own and it has been very helpful in building my speed, strength and stretching abilities.",1139356800,3,286,4.314814814814815
