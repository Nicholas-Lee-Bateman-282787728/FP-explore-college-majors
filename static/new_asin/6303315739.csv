Kinda reminds me of the Highlander TV series with all those flashbacks, which are mostly in Scotland.",1035936000,3,273,4.891304347826087
625801,5,6303315739,"This is the best series that Walt Disney produced in years
this was only cartoon that I made the time to watch when I
was a kid. It seemed to be more of a adult cartoon then a typhical
disney cartoon. And Johnthan Freaks done a great job with the
villian Xantos. And this had great FX with the animation. I had
not seen a cartoon this good since the GI.JOE days..........",1027641600,,371,4.166666666666667

I am  sad to say to all those out there reading this that the series hasn't played on T.V since I was in high school. The movie is worth everyones wild. If your into mid-evil times, mythology, and action/ adventure, you will love this movie. I hope someday disney would re-release the gargoyles t.v series. Till then, you better just buy this movie, I really recomend it.",1019433600,2,438,4.615384615384615
625803,5,6303315739,"Gargoyles is the best cartoon i have watched ever. They did good storylines to make the episodes funny and keep you on the edge of your seats. It is be far the best cartoon ever made. Don't think they could have  gotten a better cast. Strange and wierd that a majority of them are from  ""Star Trek"".
It's dissapointing that Disney stopped producing  it. It would have been worth while if they could have kept it going another  2-3 seasons.
Amazon doesn't have anymore of ""Gargoyles, The Movie:  The Heroes Awaken"" in stock so If anyone knows somewhere else i can  get it, could you drop me a line. I would really appreciate it",940464000,6,626,4.447368421052632
625804,5,6303315739,This movie if far better then any disney movie I have every seen. The storyline is excellent I would recommend it two every one.  If kids are watching this i would recommend that an adult be present,940377600,,198,4.351351351351352
625805,5,6303315739,"This movie is really the opening episodes of the Gargoyles animated series, with some content editied out for length reasons I imagine.  Anyone who has ever enjoyed a ""serious cartoon"" will fall in love with  Gargoyles instantly.  The episodes which compose this movie begin a saga  which is incredibly rich and well-crafted.  Gargoyles is quite a departure  from the standard Disney fare.  I don't possess the words to recommend  this animated series strongly enough!",932342400,5,468,5.22972972972973

7843657,5,6303315739,Now I marked this 5 stars but in reality I'd give the tape itself about 3. Let me first say that Gargoyles is a beautifully animated serise with a very good and well written story. It's a bit like batman accept more interesting. I wish Disney would promote this a bit more now by giving it a special DVD release or a theatrical movie. Now the only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the fact that this isn't actually a movie. This is merely the first 5 episodes you saw on T.V. with less footage. The end result is a story that's too fast paced and unbalenced. I wish they had actually made a movie or used all of the footage rather than just cutting the footage up. Some very entertaining scenes have been cut. One of which is a very funny scene where the Gargoyles see a kitchen for the first time and mess it up. I believe the scenes were cut to make room for the game at the end of the tape which was completley worthless. I still however recomend this movie because the story is so interesting as is the rest of the series. I would really like to see this on DVD digitally remastered and with the cut scenes restored so that the true beauty of this series can be realized.,1078790400,3,1177,4.18942731277533
7843658,5,6303315739,"This video is actually the first three episodes of the first season in the ""Gargoyles"" saga and let me say that this was and still is a really breathtaking three part video of the greatest cartoon series that Disney has ever created.
Forget ""Rescue Rangers"", ""Darkwing Duck"" and even ""Goof Troop"", those are great cartoon series but ""Gargoyles"" to me throws all of those right into orbit around the earth in every category. This series took Disney by storm with a very deep and mystical storyline that blended the fantasy folklore of gargoyles and merged fantasy with real-life history in the series timeline.
In this episode entitled ""The Awakening"" the Gargoyles exist as a clan in Castle Wyvern in northern Scotland where they co-existed quite well, if a bit on the shakily, with humanity in the castle and protected the citizens from rule-breakers and/or enemy armies who would attack them. The Clan is lead by a young but extremely strong gargoyle named Goliath along with his second in command, his mate Demona. The clan however are attacked by a huge Viking army one night in the year A.D. 994 and most of the original clan are destroyed and only seven of them survive the horrible attack that night.
During a botch spell attack, the clan are put into a stone sleep with a spell that won't be broken until the 'castle rises above the clouds' and only then would the gargoyles be reawakened from their stone sleep. A multi-billionaire businessman named David Xanatos retrieves the castle by disassembling it and transports the gargoyles in their stone forms to atop his headquarters which dwarves every other building in New York City. The spell is broken and the Gargoyles awaken to a totally different world from the one they remembered from a whole millenium before.
The Gargoyles clan are no safer in their new world than they were in their old world from a millenia before then. Humans are unaware of their existance and there's the danger of what humans may do if they encounter a gargoyle. Would they be met with caution or shunned with hate and hostility? The Gargoyles will be learning a lot that the modern world is full of enemies even more formidable than the ones from a millenium ago and some of them come from unlikely places too.
This show is to me the greatest achievement that Disney Studios has ever accomplished even today. The Animation is absolutely stunning and original like nothing I had ever seen up to this point in my life. The animation alone isn't the best thing about the series. As it is now as a grown up, the best thing about ""Gargoyles"" is it's absolutely powerful message of what prejudice and bigoty may lead to if not dealt with by the heros of the world. The ""X-Men"" cartoon series from the 1990s is another cartoon series that sheds light on this.
It's absolutely a tragedy that this show lasted only a little over two years before the show was cancelled because of the third season. Just about every other Disney Cartoon series after this one seem to revert back into forgettable generic pap with little memorability and predictable animation and bland figures.
This VHS edition of the gargoyles ""Awakening Parts I, II, and III"" is rather dissapointing in some ways. If you have seen the TV series counterpart, you will notice that the VHS edition leaves out several crucial scenes. The picture quality is also rather questionable but that may have to do with a degraded copy I got from a store a while back. The game at the ending is almost useless and almost nothing but clutter to me.
It's a great thing that at least some of the Gargoyles episodes are available on VHS but I feel that this whole series should be released onto two DVD Box Sets. One should containing all 78 episodes of ""Gargoyles"" three seasons including ""The Goliath Chronicles"" and the other should just have the first two seasons for those who disliked the third season. They should also release the three seasons separately on DVD because the picture quality of the VHS editions of the available videos is desperately calling for a picture remastering!

I give this video a five star any just because this is a great cartoon series. There will never be a cartoon series that impacted cartoon watching the way ""Gargoyles"" did and it's a shame that cartoon studios have never tried to create something as powerful and rich like ""Gargoyles"" or ""X-men"" from the 1990s and instead reverted back into predictable and forgettable animation and bland picture cartoon quality.",1078012800,23,4490,4.7650834403080875
