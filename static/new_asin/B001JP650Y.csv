8313394,4,B001JP650Y,"Well done TV Western with well known character actors in supporting roles. Clint Walker is his usual stoic self and his scenes with Kathryn Hays and young Miguel Alejandro (from ""Popi"") sets up a pilot for a  possible TV series that never happened. Ted Post keeps things moving quite well.  Not the boring, talky TV Western that so many of the Westerns made during the heyday of TV movies were.",1455580800,,394,4.614285714285714
