5000429,5,B006K1PNIM,Have all the Durham County DVD's  . . . Once you watch one you have to get the rest to see what is going to happen.  I am also a BIG Hugh Dillon Fan . . . He needs to make more movies and be in more shows . . . He is excellent in Dramas . . .,1334534400,3,242,3.0847457627118646
5000430,2,B006K1PNIM,"Loved season one and season two struggled but season 3 fell from the sky. If you did not view the first two seasons, go straight to season three and you will know as much as the rest of us. What happened? It had to be a different writer and we deserve a refund for season three or better yet they should offer viewers compensation for watching!",1424736000,,344,4.2272727272727275
5000431,4,B006K1PNIM,Wow,1409788800,,3,3.0
5000432,2,B006K1PNIM,"Often hard to look at and way too many dream / hallucenigenic sequences that never work for me. But some of the actors are great, especially the young ones.",1405987200,,156,4.413793103448276
5000433,5,B006K1PNIM,"Love this series.  Season two and three were not available for us Cox viewers in AZ, so the next best thing?  Bought them from Amazon.  Good acting, good plots, great intrigue, etc.",1394409600,,181,4.59375
5000434,4,B006K1PNIM,"Dark, realistic, great character development. Excellent acting, like that each season focused on a specific crime. Didn't want it to end",1390867200,,136,5.523809523809524
5000435,4,B006K1PNIM,"Complicated characters, all flawed in significant ways (not their acting, their essence as a character). Not for the weak at heart, often gritty, much sexual overtones and tensions, hateful destructive (self and others) behavior. will keep you wondering what's next. Yup, I liked it and recommendcontinued with the series and saw all of them.",1388707200,,342,5.351851851851852
5000436,5,B006K1PNIM,Loved it! Wish they were still making the series. I really like the characters and all of the actors were great!,1384387200,,112,4.380952380952381
5000437,1,B006K1PNIM,I viewed on Series 1 and 1/2 of Series 2 on Netflix but all three parts of the series were taken down before I finished.  Therefore I purchased last few episodes of Series 2 and all of Series 3 from Amazon. Series 1 was pretty good. Series two was a little disappointing and Series 3 was AWFUL!. If I could have I would have gotten my money back.,1382659200,2,346,4.088235294117647
5000438,4,B006K1PNIM,"My wife and I were sufficiently hooked by this series to stream the last few episodes from Amazon when Netflix dropped the series (without warning! Grr!) after we'd watched seasons 1, 2, and some of 3. As a rule we don't purchase individual content.

Excellent writing and characterization. Overall, we'd rate this series as very good - we'd  have raced through it just a couple of days faster than the 3 weeks or so we stretched it out over, had we known Netflix was going to drop it and quite a bit of other content when we were so close to the end!

It isn't quite Silence of the Lambs' level - but very few movies/series are. About on a par with The Killing.",1378771200,,662,4.32258064516129
5000439,5,B006K1PNIM,"Durham County is a terrific series, hate it that this is the last one...(Season3)...if you like The Killing, Luther and series of this type, I think you'll really like this one.  I'm looking for more like this one!",1376438400,3,214,4.631578947368421
8499981,2,B006K1PNIM,Season 1 & 2 were Thrilling. This was predictable & disappointing.,1493769600,,66,5.090909090909091
8499982,4,B006K1PNIM,"Weird show, but good.",1484697600,,21,4.5
8499983,5,B006K1PNIM,loved this crazy story but you get addicted to it:),1475107200,,51,4.2

8499985,5,B006K1PNIM,Loved it,1463616000,,8,3.5
8499986,5,B006K1PNIM,"Everyone that's seen this mentions The Killing - and rightly so. They are both terrific thrillers. Good actors, great characters, interesting twists and turns in the plot. One of my favorite things was the inclusion of the landscape. The ominous, overbearing electrical wires, the barren, flat landscape adds to the visual backdrop of this series. There is a lot that's dark and brooding, but it keeps you guessing what the characters are going to do, what their decisions will be, and if they can come to terms with their decisions. There has to be more like this! And yes, sure wish they would extend this series, they is surely enough material to do so.",1439856000,,656,4.7631578947368425
8499987,3,B006K1PNIM,"Did not live up to the first two seasons.  Very anticlimactic.  Buy it if you just want to complete your set, otherwise drive on.",1438214400,,129,4.333333333333333
8499988,5,B006K1PNIM,"BEST PRICE FOR THIS DVD SET.
WOULD BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.",1437264000,,62,4.25
8499989,3,B006K1PNIM,"One of my favorite series however it requires closed captions as much of the dialog is simply muffled in every season, but much worse on this season. I am sure I missed at least 75% of the plot due to this fault. Sure, we can get the gist of what is happening but it is very disappointing not to have every word clarified. Otherwise, with closed captioning, I would purchase the entire three seasons. There are other TV series that lack subtitles, such as The Killing, but in Net flix streaming closed captioning is available.  Too bad Netflix has stopped  streaming Durham County.",1432080000,,581,4.631067961165049
