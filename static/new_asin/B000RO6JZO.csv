2869863,2,B000RO6JZO,"i LOVE Family Guy, it really is a laugh out loud comedy. My only problem with them is this, 1/2 a season per DVD set? Sure, other shows release singles like that, but not for +30$. Until they stop trying to screw us with half a product, i'll have to halt my purchases of these sets... afterall, still have P2P.",1183248000,20,310,4.183333333333334
2869864,4,B000RO6JZO,Yes I am extremely glad that Family Guy is releasing volume 5 of their smash hit show. My major disappointment is that they decided to release only the first 13 episodes of Season 5 instead of releasing the entire season all at once. But I still can't wait for this DVD set to come out.,1182470400,60,286,4.218181818181818

2869913,2,B000RO6JZO,i looked before i purchased this dvd and i was led to believe it contained a 'chicken scene' and 'mother theresa' and that was not the case. and i felt that the information about creating family guy is fine as long as it doesn't use precious space for promised scenes that were no where to be found.,1362787200,,299,4.2631578947368425

2869917,5,B000RO6JZO,"Man, what can I say Family Guy is amazing!:) But I have to say, this is probably my favorite volume of family guy out (as of now). The new episodes are pretty damn good though. I'd definitely reccomend this volume to anyone!",1355011200,,224,4.357142857142857
2869918,5,B000RO6JZO,"This DVD contains all of the episodes from Family Guy season 5. This DVD is great for true Family Guy fans! It includes full uncensored episodes, which make them even more funny! Also, the DVD includes various bonus features including deleted scenes, extra clips, and other Family Guy related content. The episodes never get old and this DVD is perfect for a gift or to add to your own personal collection! Strongly recommended!",1348272000,,428,4.876712328767123
2869919,5,B000RO6JZO,This is a very funny movie that i think many will enjoy over 18 years old. I like that Bill Clinton is in the movie as well.,1331424000,,124,3.6296296296296298
2869920,4,B000RO6JZO,"The episodes on volume five still make me laugh after seeing them over and over, and I am a family guy nerd (although I do think the show has lost its consistency recently... they do still come out with some good episodes, but the ratio is more like 3 good episodes to every 2 bad ones, whereas it was a rarity that you ever had a subpar episode around this time).
The only problem is that this is deceiving for a 3 disc box set... only 2 discs contain episodes, the third disc is just special features. I think a lot of the Family Guy box sets are slight rip offs, but the seasons are the best values, compared to the insulting additional F.G. DVDs.... including the separation of the star wars episodes on three different dvds, Stewie Griffin the Untold Story (the DVD that started the shameless ripping off of the fans) which is 2 episodes played off as a movie, Partial Terms of Endearment - ONE unaired episode with a few cheapo special features...)
Anyway, back to season five... a must own season despite the fact that it's really a two disc box set. One of the best collections of F.G. episodes ever!",1329868800,3,1108,4.409756097560976
2869921,5,B000RO6JZO,I gave this as a Christmas gift to my son. He was very pleased. Just what he wanted. I find it strange that half-seasons are put on a disk and the other half on another. Would liked to have known exactly what episodes of season 5 are contained on the Part 1 of Season 5 disk. Had to do some research into that.,1325289600,,310,3.9365079365079363
2869922,5,B000RO6JZO,Shipping was fast and the dvds and case were just as described. Have not watched them yet but the dvds are scratch free.

2869923,5,B000RO6JZO,"Family Guy keeps getting better all the time.  This volume has some of my favorite episodes though.  ""Hell Comes to Quahog"" is a must watch for any fellow haters of Wallyworld (Wal-Mart).  The end of ""Saving Private Brian"" will have you in tears, holding your sides, laughing.  ""Road to Rupert"" is a great Stewie and Brian musical comedy.  All the rest are great also so if you're a fan of Family Guy then this is a great buy.",1317772800,,426,4.410256410256411
2869924,1,B000RO6JZO,"As a consumer, I would like to think I was getting the ""Whole Series"" as they aired. I was most disappointed when I got this.  Whoever is responsible for not including the rest of the series, please, do it.",1305676800,,206,4.282051282051282
2869925,1,B000RO6JZO,"I wish they would release the ""Family Guy"" spisodes by Seasons instead of of Volumes. What happened to Season 5, Part 2? I can't find it on here.
My guess is that they will eventually release the shows by Seasons, turning this show into a real cash cow for Seth McFarlane. It is cheesy to do and will tick off everyone who have already bought the ""Volumes"". I think it is a way to really pull the dollars from the public who love the show, but it is nasty to do that to true fans. They just should have released the episodes by Seasons in the first place like EVERY OTHER show does. Sheesh! I would love to buy the show, but I think I will wait for a while and see if they do eventually release the Seasons on DVD. That way I won't waste all my money on these ""Volumes"" that do NOT contain every episode aired anyway.

My tip to others who love this show, is to wait if you can. If you need the fix really badly for a specific episode, buy the ""Volumes"". I can wait, as I have no burning need to buy it now, because we have two episodes  per night in re-runs on the tube. So I get my fix for the show and I will wait. If they never do release the Season pkgs, (yeah, right.) I guess then I will have to buy the Volumes. But not yet. I think they will eventually release them as each Season's DVD, because people really want it that way and it is so much more money in their pockets.",1302912000,3,1382,4.003623188405797

The animatic episodes are great because you can see how the episode was really going to look like and see the changes they made. I wonder why they didn't put all of season five it on this DVD? Oh well enjoy the DVD. By the way it has now been two years since I wrote my first review. I know most people don't make a big deal out of it but to it's special.,1279152000,2,489,3.9
2869931,5,B000RO6JZO,"PLEASE READ: This will have two different reviews - One for the old Boxed Set you used to recieve, and the new slim cover that resembles volumes 7 and 8.

BOXED SET:
The Volume Five boxed set contains the first 13 episodes of Season Five. The front cover has a picture of the Griffin family singing. Meg on Piano. Chris on Clarinet. Peter, Lois, Stewie, and Brian all singing. They are performing infront of an audience (if you look cloesely) of different Family Guy Characters: Herbert, Loretta, Cleveland to name a few. The back cover has the usual set description with a list of features. It also has an alternate picture of Stewie on the back.
Inside there are three plastice cases for the discs. If you set them all in order on a table or floor, it makes one whole chaotic scene with memorable moments from the fifth volume. Disc One contains the first 6 episodes of this volume. Disc Two has the remaining 7. And disc three is all bonus material.

SLIM SET:
The artwork for this slim set is the same as the original set. The inside is much like the new ""story book"" styled sets. Which are pretty much just regular DVD cases with an extra spot for a third disc. The case is clear plastic. Instead of episode descriptions, you just get the disc number with an episode/feature list.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
If you would prefer getting a boxed set. I would suggest heading to ebay, or another website like [...].
If you really don't mind and just want the content, just go ahead and order this set (which is what you now get from Amazon).

THANKS FOR READING!!
I rate the boxed set 5 out of 5.
I rate the Slim Set 3 out of 5 for cheap packaging.",1277424000,,1640,4.384868421052632

Also, where are the widescreen versions?  I'm sure Seth McFarland creates the originals in widescreen, then P&S's them down to 4:3. Is this another way to get the fans to shell out more $$$ for the Blu-Ray versions???  (I see volume 1 is due to be released in the DB format).  Seth, without us the loyal fans, you wouldnt have a hit show, so why stick it to us by releasing half seasons and then once we've purchased those, then you release the High Def widescreen editions....",1239580800,,648,4.4033613445378155

THere's enough negative crap in the world as it is.  Sure every show and movie out there has flaws.  Nobody is perfect.  You know there is a button  on your t.v. remote that says on/off you know.  Stewie is my fave character!  I got the family guy bendable set and a Stewie plush animated doll.  HILARIOUS!!!  SOmeone always comments on it when new people come over.  You know they should make a movie: ""Chucky vs. Stewie""!  That would've been better I believe than the ""Seed of CHucky"".  THink about it, there both bout the same size and both have overalls.  Hmmmm. What you all think? Just a idea. I got a few Chucky dolls from 12"" to 30"" too.  That Stewie Halloween costume is cool too!",1224633600,,858,4.314465408805032

2869945,3,B000RO6JZO,"I've been a big Family Guy fan ever since I first saw the show back in 1999 during the original run of the show & was still a fan through the syndication runs on TBS & Cartoon Network, the DVD releases all the way to it's uncancellation on Fox (I didn't buy the CD's or books though...I don't have that much money to spend).  However, this was the DVD volume (since it's not the whole season) where I felt the show honestly started taking a turn for the worst and ""jumped the shark"" as I bought this the first day it came out & after watching it, had it sit around collecting dust for months as this volume just isn't as funny as the previous ones.  Sure Family Guy had some ""hit & miss"" episodes like any other TV show that's been on long term but this was just more misses than hits.  Eventhough the key to Family Guy is it's shock value & cutaway jokes...in the previous seasons/volumes, they had a good storyline to go along with it but this time, they rely more on the shock value of being ""uncensored"" on 11 of the 13 episodes & cut away jokes than just having a good plot based episode which wears off after watching this 2-3 times at the most.  They also tried doing things different that I honestly didn't think worked like the joke where they cutaway to the county music singer or during the ""Road To Rupert"" episode where they had Stewie replacing Jerry The Mouse dancing in a scene from an old movie...they just weren't funny & didn't do anything for me.  And eventhough your paying for 3 disc, the first two are the 13 episodes while the third one is just the deleted scenes, a short segement about how to draw Peter, 3 animatic episodes (which don't interest me at all), and another feature of all the Family Guy toys (which didn't interest me either).  So I would say this was the weakest volume released yet & it's not something I would recommend for those who aren't die hard fans of the show.",1216512000,6,1910,4.32122905027933
2869951,5,B000RO6JZO,"Hey people, you don't like the price you'll have to pay for half a season? No problem, do what I do, check in on your local pawn shops or thrift stores now and then. I got this DVD set DIRT CHEAP!!! On to the review.....

I love Family Guy. I also love Futurama and King of the Hill. All three shows have a different way of giving me the chuckles and laugh outs that I so desperately need. What I love about Family Guy is the ongoing gag of some off the wall reference, showing a crazy clip, and then back to the story.

There are some great episodes here and whoever thinks this show is getting old, well, I disagree. I laugh as much now as I did the first season. The only real change to the show is that Stewie is not trying so much to kill his mother as he is struggling with his sexuality. He 'marries' his old flame, but then dresses up like a woman for a blind date with Cris. Not only that, but when he tries to act gay with Brian to get out of the army and Iraq, he invites the gay officer for a make out session. I love that eposode in particular when Lois says ""Oh Cris you don't want to join the army, now the MARINES, those are the guys you want to ****"" As an active duty Marine for 18 years, thatline had me rolling on the ground with laughter as my wife's jaw dropped.

I for one hope Family Guy is around for a long long long time. Season 5 shows to me at least that this show is nowhere near running out of steam.",1213574400,,1431,3.9618055555555554

This is just another FOX, Inc. Rupert Murdoch screw you good for your money ploy.

You are not getting the full season. You are getting half a season. Just like they did with Season 4. Two different DVD sets, 2 huge prices.

I do not blame anyone behind Family Guy, this is a real ripoff tactic by the scumbag Rupert Murdoch himself and his Fox executives (evil minions).

I will not buy this until I find it on sale at a drastically lower price. Of course, there is always NETFLIX!",1213488000,10,621,4.282051282051282

I am a devoted fan and would definitely reccomend this to anyone. :)",1212710400,,366,4.6461538461538465
2869954,4,B000RO6JZO,"Family Guy is one of my favorite cartoon shows and I always look to buy them when they come out. The show right has reached just above 100 episodes and (in my opinion) still goin strong. Seth has a knack for creating humor and his impressions are always an automatic laugh for me. The DVD is good but not compared to the first three seasons. First of all there aren't enough episodes to be selling a box set like this, might as well have waited until the season is fully complete. The Extras are decent enough including a lot of Deleted Scenes and also pretty good commentary by Seth and the crew. I got it for $17.99 which is not bad, cuz I heard people were getting it for $29.99 for this which is most definetly not worth it, most of the negative reviews for this DVD was because of the price being to high but I guess there is no need to complain anymore.

The series itself is always funny but it can get repetitive a lot of times like for example the ""Chicken Fights"" was great the first 2 or 3 times but now it is just an annoyance and not even entertaining anymore, they should really stop wasting time animating them because the fights are actually one of the most complicated to animate. Also, while some jokes may be hilarious, some feel like Deja Vu to me, especially the parodies they do which is way too predictable. So the rate the series is going right now it probably has 2 seasons left in em, but if they fix the problems it could run endlessly. So to the Family Guy staff, keep things freakin fresh.",1207699200,,1518,4.289198606271777

Unfortunately, the problems with Family Guy become more frequent in this season and the show loses some quality.

2869957,1,B000RO6JZO,"*sigh*... Family Guy used to be my favorite show. I own seasons 1-4 on DVD and they are JEWELS. They are seasons I will trasure forever.

I had missed all the eps on TV so I bought this, even though it was half the season. Now watching the season, I noticed:

1). There's more Chicken Fights in the first 5 episodes than ANY OF THE OTHER SEASONS COMBINED! Why did they need to increase the amout of chicken fights? That's like having 5 episodes on one disc and then calling it a full season.

2. At this point in the show, the show's title should have been changed to ""A Show With Brian and Stewie"". Seriously, more than half the episodes are set on Stewie and Brian alone. I could tell they weren't interesed in any of the other characters.

3. Every episode, the show just keeps getting more and more repetitive. I found it pretty depressing that my favorite show turned into The Simpsons. Once a second rate Simpsons, always a second rate Simpsons!

4. The jokes just keep getting more and more forced. Almost all the jokes refrence Pop Culture, and then there's a flashback/parody of a famous people and popculture. I could swear the show's becoming a cash in now. It's time they stopped the show here.

In short, this series needs to stop here. It's crap now. And it really makes me sad as a Family Guy lover to be typing this review up.",1205107200,9,1342,4.391129032258065
2869958,3,B000RO6JZO,"I love this show! Especially the early seasons and the ""Stewie Griffen: The Untold Story"" movie. After it returned from being cancelled, however, it gradually got less and less funny. This season still made me laugh quite a bit but none of the episodes kept me laughing long enough to make my face hurt, which to me is what a really great comedy should do.  Everything considered, if you are a fan of this series as I am, you will want to own this half season DVD for your collection, but if you don't already own the other seasons I would recommend getting the ""Family Guy Freakin' Party Pack"" which includes the complete series, the movie, a bonus disc with special features and a crapload of cool family guy stuff(playing cards, etc.)",1204243200,3,737,4.583333333333333

(Obviously, I bought season 5 vol. 1, didn't I) But, it is far too much money to spend on 2 disks, and an extra disk of nothing. This is no way to treat your fans, that saved you from cancellation.

2869963,4,B000RO6JZO,"The reason for the full price for half a season is simple. When Fox realized they made a mistake when they cancelled it, they basically begged the creator to come back. The show was already picked up by Cartoon Network, so McFarlane raked Fox over the coals to get as much money as possible. And I don't blame him a bit. In an effort to recoup some of their losses, Fox decided to split the seasons to double their profits. Why do you think the first 3 seasons were NOT broken up?

He had four years when Family Guy was off the air to come up with ideas for new episodes. The man is not distracted. I'm sure he has dozens of more ideas already on the shelf.

This one only had episodes on two discs. The third disc was just lame special features.

i do like American Dad. Yes, i do! cast your judgment as you will, i know i did. But American Dad seems to be more old school FG i would say and it's not as annoying or and random as FG is today.

This is an unacceptable format and is just one little screw you that the target audience of the show (college age - 35 year old males) will put up with for awhile.  This will and has inspired resentment in friends of mine and has caused them to view recent seasons more harshly.  This is still a great show, but when half a season costs $39.99, the listed price, that means the price of a full season would be 80$.  With other shows, such as the simpsons, selling COMPLETE seasons for 20$ it makes it dificult to shell out cash for another half season of Family Guy.  The goodwill the show has built up with its hilarity won't last much longer when it continually screws its fans.  Either release full seasons or sell the half seasons at $20 or less.

In summary buy this DVD if you love Family Guy, which I do, but beware that your only getting half a season.  You may want to buy some Simpsons seasons instead and get twice the length of entertainment.",1194825600,76,1089,4.383084577114428

2870063,4,B000RO6JZO,"Another fun, watched many times over, Family Guy DVD.  This time just with two DVDs of 13 total episodes (the third disc is bonus material).  I don't like some of these episodes as well as the others in the Family Guy series, but I still watched these discs 4 times already, so who am I to knock them.  If you are wondering about the blue limited edition version, I have that one and I like it mostly because it's ultra thin and doesn't take up much room in my expanding DVD cabinet.  The bonus booklet isn't that great.  It is just pictures of some of the main characters sitting at a bar.  I only got one storyboard with my set which is just a card with sketches from a scene.  The box advertised 5 storyboards so, I'm not sure if there were 5 made and you will get one of the five or if I got ripped off.  If you want to keep your collection looking consistent on your shelf, I would just get the standard release as you won't be missing much.

Disc 1:
""Stewie Loves Lois""--Peter has a prostate exam and thinks he was raped (Lois's reaction:  ""[snicker, snicker] What?"")  Meanwhile, after Lois saves Rupert's life, Stewie smothers her--but this time with love.
""Mother Tucker""--Ha, ha, that title sounds like something else, huh?  Anyway, Peter's mom gets a divorce and starts dating anchorman Tom Tucker and Peter reverts to childhood with Tucker being his new daddy.  Also, Brian tries to host an intellectual radio program on the same station that features ""Weenie and the Butt.""  My favorite part is the Peanuts reunion where Charlie Brown mourns the drug-related death of his best friend, ""I don't give a cr*p about Woodstock, but SNOOPY!""
""Hell Comes to Quahog""--Meg wants a car so Peter gets her a tank which will later prove to be useful.  To earn money for a more practical vehicle, Meg gets a job at the Super Megastore much to Brian's chagrin (as Lois said when Brian turned off the air conditioning due to its damaging effect on the OZone, ""Save your hippie cr*p for the winter months"").
""Saving Private Brian""--The army recruiters start influencing Chris so Peter gets him to join a rock band as a distraction.  Meanwhile, Brian takes Stewie to the recruiting office to complain and they end up enlisting.  Thankfully, in this episode, Stewie finally kills those annoying Vaudeville guys.  Marilyn Manson makes his or her appearance (well, in animated form--no guest voice).
""Whistle While Your Wife Works""--Peter blows off his fingers in a firework mishap so Lois takes over his job while Peter just wants to screw around in the office.  We meet Brian's airheaded girlfriend Jillian who's hilarious (""I was watching something on TV about this guy named Hitler...Somebody should stop him!"")  I'm bummed they broke up this past season.
""Prick Up Your Ears""--Lois is concerned that there is no sex ed at the high school so she teaches the class herself but angers the conservatives who only want her to teach abstinence.  When the school takes over sex ed, the students (including Meg) start practicing a peculiar type of safe sex (leading to this brilliant line by Tom Tucker: ""Once you go black, you go deaf."").  Meanwhile, Stewie is paranoid about the tooth fairy.

Disc 2:
""Chick Cancer""--One of my favorite episodes in this set.  Lois forces Peter to watch a chick flick, and he is very moved (emotionally) by it and decides to make his own.  Meanwhile, Stewie is reunited with former musical theatre partner Olivia.
""Barely Legal""--Brian goes to the prom with a suicidal Meg who becomes obsessed with him.  Also, Mayor West sends the entire Quahog police force to South America and Peter and the gang enter the police academy and blacks feel safe to dance in the streets.
""Road to Rupert""--Lois totally disses the ""Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story"" DVD at the beginning of this one (""It's a middle finger to the fans"").  Brian unknowingly sells Stewie's beloved teddy bear at a yard sale and they go on a trek to Aspen, Colorado following the family who bought it (what was in that box that fell out of that moving van, anyway?).  When Peter gets his driver's license suspended, he develops a new-found appreciation for his chaufeur, Meg.  That dancing number with Gene Kelly and Stewie taking the role of Jerry the Mouse in Anchors Away really goes on.
""Peter's Two Dads""--After Peter's father dies, he finds out he was not his biological dad.  His real father lives in Ireland and bears a striking resemblance.  In the meantime, Stewie becomes attached to Lois after she struck him (I don't think there was any real closure to this part of the story).
""The Tan Aquatic with Steve Zissou""--A day spent on the golf course without sunscreen has Stewie deciding to adopt a tan lifestyle but, after a tanning bed mishap, fears he's developed skin cancer.  Also, after beating up a 13-year-old, Peter sees how much fun can be had being a bully.
""Airport '07""--Peter decides to become a redneck (my favorite part of this whole set is Carl Sagan's Cosmos edited for Rednecks) and that somehow leads to him syphoning off jet fuel causing Quagmire to crash his plane and get fired.  The gang tries to get Glen's job back with some Airplane II-influenced ideas (one of the greatest movies of all time).
""Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey""--Lois is concerned about Peter's wild friendship with Bill Clinton so she, uh, tries to put the relationship to bed.  Meanwhile, Brian is pressured to potty train.

Disc 3:
All bonus material, my favorite of which are the deleted scenes.  It also includes Drawing Peter featurette, Toys, Toys Galore featurette, 3 animatic episodes with optional commentary: ""Stewie Loves Lois,"" ""Prick Up Your Ears,"" and ""Chick Cancer.""  There is also commentary on all the episodes on the other two discs.",1192838400,4,5737,4.770242914979757

They really need to start paying attention to the consumer because they are going to lose big if they keep cutting these shows in half. Just read some of the reviews. It's not the show that people are unhappy with, it's the fact that they are being split up & the cost of half of a season that's the problem.

Since Family Guy came back, the jokes have been horrible. The episode where Peter's dad dies is just awful. That was fine, I can deal with some subpar episodes, but how much is this DVD for that amount of episodes?

Eric Cartman was right. Family Guy must be stopped. Wait...Lets just place the blame on Fox. They cancelled 3 great shows in their prime...Arrested Development, Futurama, and Family Guy. Plus they charge up these DVDs...Fox is just a horribly run network.",1192665600,14,564,4.519607843137255

3) It is kind of a rip off to have only half of the season in this disk set, but you don't have to buy it if you don't want to.  I bought it to finish my collection (I have every other Family Guy DVD).

2870095,3,B000RO6JZO,"Let me first say this, I basically agree with everything that has been said about the last two Family Guy sets being half seasons.  It IS a rip-off to pay full season price for half a season.  That is my only gripe...the pricing.

On the other hand the first half, Volume 4, was released before the season was actually over.  Understandably, they released the second half (which, again, had not been aired when Volume 4 was release) in a Volume 5.  They COULD have waited for the season to end, but were greedy enough to rush the 1st half to market to catch the show's hype being reaired after a few year's of cancellation.

I'll also echo that Season 4 (volumes 4 & 5) haven't quite lived up to the quality seen in 1 - 3 (2&3 being especially good).  A number of the jokes are forced, there are a number of inside jokes that fall flat (the Chicken fight I'll never tire of though), and a number of those drawn out moments that draw out too long.

Here's to hoping Family Guy finds it's groove again in Season 5, and here's to hoping 20th Century Fox is patient and releases it as 1 Volume when it comes to DVD.",1191369600,3,1111,4.257142857142857

2870100,3,B000RO6JZO,"Okay, first of all, everyone stop defending Fox splitting the seasons into two boxed sets.  If you can buy an entire season of American Dad in one set, I don't see any reason why you can't do the same with Family Guy.  It's greedy and the notion someone keeps asserting that ""Fox only wants the box set numbers to catch up with the seasons!!!"" is ridiculous.  I'm sure there aren't any Fox execs losing sleep at night worrying about whether the Family Guy box volume numbers match the seasons of the show.  Now onto the review...

  This season (or this HALF) is really strange.  The show killed off four regular guest characters (thank GOD one of them was Peter's father) and had some truly unfunny moments (did ANYONE laugh at ""Prom night dumpster babies""?  Anyone?).  The show also seemed to get a bit more lowbrow this season too relying on profanity too much to make the show funny.  My 15-year-old stepson got a kick out of hearing the F-bomb at least once an episode but it takes more than that to make me laugh.  If I sound like I'm complaining, it's just that I've always felt that Family Guy broke taboos but did it in an intelligent way.  Now it just seems to be aiming at the least common denominator.  That's not to say this set was entirely unfunny because there were some laugh out loud moments.  It almost seems like the show is at a turning point or that they're trying to dust off and reset.  I hope that's the case.",1190764800,6,1434,4.416030534351145

2870122,1,B000RO6JZO,"When this series first came out, it was hard to convert me. I wasn't a fan of Stewie's act/character. I didn't get it, too rebellious and obnoxious to me, but eventually I was won over. I have the 4 volumes, and couldn't wait to add this one to my collection since I never caught the new episodes on TV, but even the one and only TV show I watch has shown some wear and tear. They've ran out of punchlines. Most of the punchlines and humor seems forced. Some of it revolves around a skit that may have appeared in a previous episode. A lot of the skits seen in the new ones kinda ""kick the dead horse."" Gratuitous dropping of the 'f' bomb, nudity, and desperate, overshot attempts at a humorous scene are exactly the opposite of what the other episodes used to be. I know The Simpsons is the longest running TV show ever, and that if Seth MacFarlane would've announced the end of this series after just four seasons fans would've been shocked, but it would've been quitting while he was ahead. I'm honestly truly disappointed, and can't believe I'm stuck with three discs that I have very little use for. I actually found myself feeling awkward when I came in the house with this, brand new, turned it on, and sat in a quiet room with the rest of my family.

My main question would be this: Where is the funny?

Seriously, who the hell is this funny to other than the writers? I laughed exactly 6 times for the entire DVD set. It was AWFUL. This is supposed to be a comedy cartoon right?

The show has gone down hill a bit after Seth created American Dad. I learned something after Family Guy, Vol. 4 (Season 4 Part 2) was released. When I first saw the episodes on tv, I thought they went downhill very fast. Then I watched them on dvd and I loved them. I don't know why but it was much funnier on dvd. I do hate how they run a new season for about three weeks and then stop new shows for awhile.  I watched this epsiodes and they have added a few scenes in a couple shows. Its probably some of the funniest shows they've ever done. I love when Peter runs thru the park naked and Adam West looks at him in disguist and says get a tan. I also loved Stewie hi-jacking the car.

Ill never figure out people who release tv shows on dvd. Some shows can have 10 shows per season and they spread it on three dvds or more then charge you at least 30 dollars for the set. I was very unhappy with the third dvd being bonus features because Family Guy never has any good bonus material. They have dvds that hold up to 6 hours or more now. You can fit a whole season into less then two dvds. I guess the companys wants to give you a flashy package and expects you to pay top dollar for it.",1190419200,3,1318,3.9511278195488724

IT WAS NOT

This scene elicited this response from the lady of the house: ""That's enough! I'm through!"" My response? 'press Eject, return DVD to case, and hide the box set. The decision now is whether to throw it in the trash or find someone who might enjoy it. Unfortunately, I would be embarassed to give this to anyone, so it will probably be $30 down the toilet.

Beyond the issue of offering fans an ""uncensored"" option, it is interesting that when one selects the ""CENSORED"" option, the f-word is bleeped, but words like G-D*mit and SOB are not. Note too that ""uncensored"" is the default setting, and further, selecting ""censored"" only pertains to the audio, NOT the shots of Peter Griffin's private parts, or the multiple scenes of vomiting (wasn't one enough for this season?), or the shots of heads exploding (wasn't one enough for the whole series?), or severed fingers, children on fire, and children being beat up.

But then, why were any of these words deemed necessary to the shows to begin with? Why spend the money to give the audience and ""uncensored"" option? What possible benefit is there in doing it? It is truly mind-boggling.

Knowing what I know now, would I have spent the $150 or so for all these box sets had I known that McFarlane was really this crude and unmindful of who his paying customers are? Maybe, maybe not.

One cannot take away the fact that the first three volumes of FG are very good. I suppose I should have followed my instincts with Volume 4, which towards its end, showed signs of the serie's decline. Still though, who knew it would just fall off the cliff as it did with Volume 5?!

If you have made it this far, you'll notice no mention of this volume's funny and memorable shows (there were a few good gags). That is because ALL of its good points are overwhelmed by this reviewer's sense of abandon by this series.

There is another reviewer on here that compared multiple DVD sets at a price per minute ratio. I will go one better and spell out the price per minute with all of the Family Guy box sets. Instead of focusing on number of episodes, season number, or how it's split, wrap your little brain-pans around this:

Family Guy, V. 1. Run Time 632 Minutes Price $35 = 5.5 cents a minute
Family Guy, V. 2. Run Time 495 Minutes Price $35 = 7.0 cents a minute
Family Guy, V. 3. Run Time 292 Minutes Price $28 = 9.5 cents a minute
Family Guy, V. 4. Run Time 314 Minutes Price $25 = 7.9 cents a minute
Family Guy, V. 5. Run Time 379 Minutes Price $26 = 6.9 cents a minute

So except for the first DVD release, this is the CHEAPEST DVD set they have released. No one was complaining about Vol. 3 at almost 10 cents a minute. The most expensive season. Get over it people. Don't look at it as a 'by episode' or a 'by season', look at it for what you're actually getting. Trust me, you're getting more for your money with this set than you have in the past. The numbers don't lie.",1189036800,25,1194,4.076595744680851
2870222,3,B000RO6JZO,"...and Family Guy Vol 5 is 13 episodes by roughly 20 minutes each, running time is about 4 hours and 20 minutes. SO, when it comes to value, the $25 price is actually a bargain.

3 Stars - Still funny but I didn't enjoy these shows as much as the previous seasons.

However, I can understand the emotions rising from the split of the seasons. Just charge us more and give us the whole season at once.

I know and can sympathize with all of the folks who are complaining about this. The people who publish and make the decisions for the DVD sets of The Simpsons are awesome...each episode with commentary and a episode index booklet...Well, all except for those dang ""Collectable"" dust collecting ""Head"" boxes.

On the other hand, I picked up pone of the best shows on television the other day....Friday Night Lights....$19.99 for the WHOLE first season....That's 22 episodes at 42 minutes each! Now, that's a bargain we can all live with. (And...check out Friday Night Lights...one of the best shows on television right now, along with ""Dexter"", ""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""Flight of the Conchords""...

But don't tell me that it costs too much.  I don't disagree that the price is high, but hello, I still remember when all forms of media were a lot cheaper than this.  If you expect things to just remain at the same price as they always have, you have a lot of realizing to do.  Remember when a gallon of gas was under 1 dollar?  The economy is not static, and you wouldn't want it to be.  It costs 10+ bucks to go see a movie!  We're not talking about a shift in ""Family Guy"" prices as if they are rising in a vacuum.  Why not compare it to other highly popular shows, not other cartoons?  I mean, all TV show DVDs are ridiculously expensive...but of course they would be...if you're watching a DVD of a TV show, you're not watching TV.  If you're not watching TV, TV is losing viewers...if TV loses viewers, it loses ad revenue, etc.  These DVD releases are highly valuable to show producers and should be for you, too.

If you believe your money is better invested elsewhere, don't buy it.  But don't give the content of the material a bad review because you disagree with the price.  That's not the point of the product review!  And also...complaining about it on Amazon is really rather unproductive.  You think Seth MacFarlane or any of the producers/distributors of this DVD are sitting around at home reading Amazon reviews?  I highly doubt it.

Price point out of the equation, just the frustration of not being able to buy full seasons at the same time is getting old. I've bought the first four volumes when I could catch them at a discount, but looks like from here on out it's just me and the Philips DVD Recorder. Face it, the commentaries are usually without value and other so-called ""extras"" just don't justify purchasing the sets.

Some of the more mathematically challenged reviewers have argued that $26 bucks is somehow a ripoff for this show.  For their benefit I've included some price/running time comparisons with other comedy shows.

Family Guy, V. 5.  Run Time 379 Minutes  Price $26 =  6.9 cents a minute
Harvey Birdman, V. 3.  Run Time 159 Minutes  Price $23 = 14.5 cents a minute

South Park, V. 10  Run Time 308 Minutes  Price $35 = 11.4 cents a minute

As you can see, Family Guy Volume 5 is a bargain compared to many if not most comedy box sets.

When CreepShow season 1 with only 8 episodes goes for 30, and any anime has 4 or 5 and goes for 50, you can't single out Family Guy for anything.
  That being said, Family Guy is of course still side-splitting to fans, and ""selling out"" to all the people that like to think they're cool for liking it ""first."" If you're one of the insecure latter, this probably isn't the dvd set for you. If you're a fan, like myself, then this is GREAT! like all the others.

The episode where Peter has a prostate exam and thinks he is a victim of sexual harrassment as a result is one of the funniest episodes Family Guy ever had. This one also ranks at the top and is worth the price.

2870285,3,B000RO6JZO,"I have been waiting for this DVD to come out since the day after Volume four was released, to be honest :-)
Therefore, I was all the more disappointed to find out that there were only going to be less than 15 episodes on a set that fans have anticipated for almost a year!
I haven't seen all the the individual episodes yet (although the ones I did see were hilarious, as usual) and couldn't wait to finally watch them and now they do this half-season nonsense.

This is a huge and expensive blow for us fans, consdidering that volume one still had a whole 28 episodes on it and cost just about the same.
Dare I say I will be purchasing Season 10 of ""The Simpsons"" instead?",1186531200,8,673,4.2578125
2870286,5,B000RO6JZO,"I have preordered Volume 5 because I am guaranteed the best price available from Amazon.  You can't lose!  Many complain about the volumes not being complete seasons, but can you honestly say that you don't get $25 worth of joy from each DVD set?  Really looking forward to release date.  Love the show!!!!",1186444800,7,306,4.716981132075472
2870287,1,B000RO6JZO,"Family guy is a great show, but when you go from fitting eight episodes on a dixc to putting only five episodes on a disk, it's a rip off.  Season four(Volumes 3 and 4) COULD HAVE been put into one set, but they weren't.  Why? Two words.  RIP OFF.  Did i buy them, yes, but hearing that there are only 20 episodes in this season, and they are going to put them out in two volumes?!?!  You know damn good and well that they COULD HAVE put them onto one volume if they really wanted to.

I love the show, but if what i hear is true, doing this is nothing more than ripping off the consumers, and fans of the show.

I love the show, but i will not be buying this.",1186272000,20,660,3.917293233082707
2870288,1,B000RO6JZO,"Wow, it was good for a while but Fox really never should have brought this show back from the dead. The jokes are lame and drag on forever, the non-sequiter cutaways are more obsecure (the parody of them on South Park was dead on) and the plots are running very thin, even for Family Guy standards. After five seasons this show has already run its course and is no longer fresh, which amazes me because after eighteen seasons The Simpsons is still sharp and funny, maybe not as much as it use to be but definetly much more so than Family Guy. By the way, for all you people that haven't caught on yet, this show IS a huge rip off of The Simpsons, admit it. The family is modeled after The Simpsons and entire segments are just ripped off of them as well. Please put this dead dog to rest and cancel Family Guy for good this time.",1185926400,15,829,4.220125786163522
2870289,4,B000RO6JZO,"Since Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy was brought back from the dead by Fox a few years back, the show has remained a hit thanks to it's brand of out of nowhere references and humor.  However, as some episodes in this collection will tell you, the comedy is starting to get stale.  The jokes and visual gags just aren't as funny as they used to be, and I'm sorry for pointing this out and even mentioning it, but since South Park's ""Cartoon Wars"", the show just doesn't provide the laugh out loud hilarity for me that it used to.  Despite that though, the episodes found here are winners, including Brian and Stewie joining the military and going to Iraq, Peter sues his doctor for sexual harassment and later gets a job at the Wal-Mart-esque superstore that is destroying Quahog, and Meg falls in love with Brian (yes, you read that right).  The voice cast still does great work, and despite the flaws (the Brian and Stewie interplay is really downplayed, the Marilyn Manson gag isn't half as funny or clever as it thinks it is), this first part of the fifth season of Family Guy succeeds.  And yes, as previous reviews have already stated, this is only half a season and we are being milked for our money, but considering the DVD market over the past few years, should we really be surprised?  If you're a die hard fan of the series, you'll be picking this up regardless.",1185408000,46,1370,4.526315789473684
2870290,1,B000RO6JZO,"I love Family Guy.  I own every season on DVD.  But I will not be buying this volume.

It was understandable that they split Season 4 into two separate volumes--it made the season numbers and the volume numbers identical.

But splitting Season 5 into two separate volumes and charging more for one volume than a previous entire season costs is just greedy.

You will not be getting any more money from me!",1185235200,58,405,4.569444444444445
2870291,5,B000RO6JZO,"They are releasing only half a season because they released the first two seasons in volume 1. So now season 3 is volume 2 and season 4 is volume 3. It confuses people. So by releasing the first half of season five in voulume 4, they can release the second half of season 5 in volume 5, and correct the error.
Plus it was a big season with many episodes.",1184284800,11,354,4.071428571428571
