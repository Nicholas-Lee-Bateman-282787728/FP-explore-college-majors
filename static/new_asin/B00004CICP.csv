1338897,5,B00004CICP,"The Box of Delights is a fantastic television programme.  As a little girl, I remember watching the programme every christmas in Britain and was a childhood tradition. In Canada, however, it is not available.  The show is brilliant, full of magic and myth.  Both parents and children will love this programme, I definitely recommend The Box of Delights for anyone who enjoys Arthurian Legend or British/Celtic mythology.",1070841600,18,420,5.2388059701492535

1338900,5,B00004CICP,"Absolutely one of the best Christmas movies of all time .  Taped it in 1984 from the Wonderworks tv series on PBS, and have been waiting ever since for a region 1 dvd to be made available .  Hopefully before my vhs degrades much further .",1386806400,,238,4.1521739130434785
1338901,5,B00004CICP,This one always comes out for Xmas . It has been produced very close to the book and thats what I like .,1379894400,,104,3.5652173913043477
1338902,5,B00004CICP,"I think I first saw this on PBS Wonderworks when I was young, I bought it on VHS but by then we had no VCR.We used the internet to find the code to make our DVD player region free and FINALLY, I could watch my movie! Yes, the special effects are dated (like BBC Lion, Witch and Wardrobe) but still I love it. The book (by John Masefield is wonderful as well)",1364428800,,358,3.986111111111111
1338903,5,B00004CICP,I am still waiting for this to come out in Region 1 DVD version. Too bad. The folks in the US would love it.,1357603200,,108,3.5416666666666665
1338904,5,B00004CICP,"THE BOX OF DELIGHTS features Patrick Troughton, who played the second Doctor Who, in this magical BBC Christmas fantasy. If you enjoy good fantasy, the BBC version of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, or classic Doctor Who, you will enjoy this wonderful film. PLEASE NOTE: the Simon and Schuster edition is only 120 minutes long and has been cut by 43 minutes. Get the BBC Classics version which is 163 minutes (see the blue cover in ""other images"" for this item.",1252281600,8,467,4.63855421686747
1338905,5,B00004CICP,"""The Box of Delights"" is based on a childrens' novel by John Masefield. This BBC production was shown in the US decades ago. I managed to catch a few episodes then and was mightily intrigued. Recently I got my hands on a recording and saw it all.

While the production quality is good, the special effects are rather old-fashioned. No CGI here; fantastic creatures are either costumes, or cel animation superimposed into the live action. But it holds up, and kids won't mind.

As for the story . . . it's a about a boy whose holiday vacation is complicated by a plot by a evil magician to muck up the Christmas festivities at a local cathedral. In the first of the six half-hour episodes the young hero meets up with werewolves disguised as clergymen, a 1000 year old Punch & Judy man (Patrick Troughton, ""Dr. Who"" number 2), a pagan witch, a shapeshifting ancient warrior, and a phoenix. What's not to like?",1202256000,3,908,4.564417177914111
1338906,5,B00004CICP,"When I was growing up, I always looked forward to them playing this on wonderworks. When I grew up and wonderworks was no longer around I would go to the library and borrow it. I am hoping to eventually be able to own this movie.  If you enjoy magical movies this is definately one to watch!",1171324800,2,291,4.196428571428571
1338907,5,B00004CICP,"I taped this mini series off tv in 1984, and every Christmas season my family and I love to watch this.  (I bought newer better copies when they became available.)  Set in the English country in the early 1930's, it is very charming.  A young boy's magical experiences and how he saves everyone, including the town's 1000th Christmas celebration in the Tatchster Cathedral.  It's alot like an early Harry Potter, but with the snow and Christmas music.  I have found 3 different versions of this movie---depending on how much they edit and shorten it.  I prefer the long version, 165 minutes, with all the details, quirky characters, quaint scenery and settings, and lots of charm.",1164326400,16,680,4.869565217391305
1338908,5,B00004CICP,"Not widely known in the USA, BOD is a fantastical piece that revolves around a boy entrusted with the Box of Delights vs. a mob of villans. This series is traditional viewing in England. Anyone seeing it when young still looks forward to it's viewing each year, essentially, the US equivelent of A Charlie Brown Christmas or Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer in popularity. For it's time the VFX were of notable production value.",1132012800,7,426,4.8493150684931505

7919715,5,B00004CICP,"Thrilled that a childhood favorite is now in our own home to watch at Christmastime (or whenever). Benefit of this UK version is that it is the entire production, not the edited version for US release. NOTE: This is a UK disc, so must be played on a region-free or PAL DVD player in North America.",1491609600,,297,4.321428571428571

So glad I found it!",1439596800,,38,4.571428571428571
7919721,5,B00004CICP,"This is a family favorite that we taped off TV twice, then purchased the DVD. We now have grandchildren who look forward to seeing it. This is such a part of Christmas at our house that we bought a Region 2 DVD player just to watch this DVD! I guess that I am not recommending that you buy a player, but if you have a Region 2 capable player I am recommending that you buy this DVD. We hope that it is released digitally at some point.",1419552000,,435,4.011494252873563
7919722,5,B00004CICP,Loved this when my family lived in the UK in the 80's!  But now back in the US.  Does anyone know if the the DVDs offered here on Amazon can be played in the US?  Is it different from the old videos which couldn't go from Britain to US?  Thanks! :),1417478400,,248,3.803921568627451
7919723,5,B00004CICP,"Robert Stephenss portrayal of Abner Brown is deliciously evil in its rendering. Add to the mix the rather spooky opening credits and the very good supporting cast of actors including the enigmatic Patrick Troughton. The resultant childrens show was one of the best of the 1980s. The use of live action and early use of Quantel Paintbox, a specialist computer graphics programme gave the show an imaginative look  which for todays audiences may seem dated. For what it is worth I found the show suspenseful and highly entertaining and I cannot understand some of the rather negative reviews about this show, such as a Mother and her children saying that they found the programme boring!? If you're unsure about purchasing this DVD then at least rent it.",1389916800,2,752,4.921259842519685
