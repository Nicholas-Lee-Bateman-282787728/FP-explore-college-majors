8159558,4,B000KWZ3E6,"This is a DVD on Boeing 777 aircraft flown by Varig Brazil, most of which is concentrated on a round trip between Sao Paulo and Madrid, Spain, with a couple other short flights thrown in.  It's recent video, so good quality, but not up to the recent stuff.

Most of the flying sequences are average, and if you are interested in the piloting, or in seeing Brazil from the air, there are better videos.  You also will have to watch long discussions about the personal histories of the pilots, which I did not enjoy.

Why you should own this one is that a pilot who is quite good in his explanations takes  you down into the equipment bay of the 777.  Ever wondered what it looks like, or what the computers that run the 777 look like?  Here's your answer.  Fascinating is the best word I have for it.  The same pilot also takes us through the access computer on the flight deck.  Neither of these is in any other video I know of.

There is a lengthy instrument discussion, but the United 777 video, for one, is better at that.  There is also a lot of paperwork, which has been replaced in newer versions of the aircraft by the electronic flight bag.  Fun to watch it here and then compare the same process on the Air Canada Blu-Ray 777 presentations.

Worth buying this one, but bring your remote control for the second viewing.",1333670400,,1327,4.385245901639344
8159559,4,B000KWZ3E6,"Again, another detailed video about the B777-200 from Just Planes (World Air Routes). I strongly recommend this DVD as it will give you a walkthrough about the interior and exterior of the B777-200 (exterior check, interior flight insturments, flight crew rest room, how flight crew oxygen masks works, and many more features.) In addition to that the flight crew's personality are great. It would be a shame to miss watching this show.",1217030400,,436,5.069444444444445
