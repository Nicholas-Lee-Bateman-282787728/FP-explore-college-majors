8560736,4,B00B1FXLNQ,"This was a very enlightening DVD...don Schmitt really knows his stuff, & it was nice to hear fresh information about an old subject. This isn't a flashy movie, but it is very worthwhile.",1374969600,,186,4.666666666666667
8560737,4,B00B1FXLNQ,Roswell UFO Crash treats Roswell as a criminal investigation. Killer concept for sure. My ufo collection is pretty big and this definitely a stand out. If you have friends who are doubters throw this on.,1374710400,,203,4.828571428571428
8560738,1,B00B1FXLNQ,"I find this topic fascinating BUT.....the entire 2 hours is Don Schmidt talking to a sleepy audience at some poorly attended convention.  And he surely LOVES to hear himself talk!  No interviews with key individuals.  No footage of any kind.  No production value of any kind.  No new information.  A very disappointing, boring waste of money.",1369872000,3,342,5.017857142857143
8560739,4,B00B1FXLNQ,I wasn't sure it was possible to breathe more life into the Roswell case but this video does it. Lots of fresh info and a unique approach to the whole incident and it's aftermath. A must for the ufo freaks like me.,1362700800,2,214,4.119047619047619
