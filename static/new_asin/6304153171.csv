807401,4,6304153171,"When a ship sailing for America catches fire and sinks, very few passengers survive. Michael Taylor (Gary Cooper) takes command of the only surviving lifeboat and makes some tough decisions to expell some of its occupants for survival. Once he is rescued, he is brought to trial for murdering the men he kicked out of the boat. Fortunately, the entire story is allowed to be told. Michael and his friend Powdah (George Raft) are in the slave ship business, although Michael has secret dealings with the authorities. His rival Stanley Tarryton (Henry Wilcoxon) is secretly involved in the trade although it is his job to abolish it. To complicate matters, Michael falls in love with Tarryton's sister Margaret (Frances Dee). They all end up together on the fatal ship to America.

Souls at Sea is based on real events, although the story has been made up to avoid making any accusations. The bulk of the story involves the rivalry between Michael and Stanley, the friendship between Powdah and Micahel, and the love story between Margaret and Michael. Cooper truly carries the story, and he does it well, especially in his romantic scenes. He was known for being a quiet man, but he is able to tell a great deal simply in his facial expressions. Consequently, the images are more memorable than the dialogue.",1219708800,5,1307,4.860986547085202
807402,3,6304153171,"Cooper and Raft are well cast as buddies on the seas of the 1850s, fighting the slave trade.  There's a sinking ship climax reminiscent of TITANIC on a small scale and a court drama where Cooper is accused of  wanton murder in rescuing some but not all from the wreck.  Impeccably  restored black and white print and well directed with good solid  performances.  Oscar nommed for Art Direction, Score and Assistant  Director.",933206400,13,425,4.819444444444445

7864564,5,6304153171,"A wonderful, overlooked film from the Thirties.  So much to say about the sets, the authenticity of featuring deck actions with Sea Chanteys, even the repeated bawdy one that the two sailor/heroes use to quip and banter with one another.  However, the most important aspect of this story is the fact of the ban on international slave trading that the UK established in 1807.  All other European countries except Portugal signed on.  The U.S. also passed its own ban the same year.  Most Americans have no idea that America had done this so early in its history.  The ban was serious; it got a $300.00 fine for every smuggled slave.  The active blockade that Britain kept up off the African coast, along with U.S. patrols on our eastern seaboard and Caribbean led to the development of faster sailing ships for blockade running, which is an entire history by itself.  The inclusion in this film of a display of a map of the active British blockade and other aspects of it make this an educational film today!  Credit ought to be given to Western Civilization and all  the nations and peoples who fought and died to end slavery everywhere.  Only Western Civilization ever dreamt, tried, and mostly succeed.  This history is suppressed because it would blunt the current social justice industry which must demonize the West and white people in general in order to continue.  That is one of the great, hidden evils of our time.

7864566,3,6304153171,"What is it that would make an editor of the compact disc (DVD) version of Souls at Sea replace one of the best, most beautiful, sensitive movie
scenes with a crude, mundane, relatively uninteresting and childish optional is, to me, a mystery that will never be explained.
It can never be explained because there is probably no one living who can explain why it was done.
Of course, what was available to the DVD editor, I do not know. But i do know the replacement scene replaced one of the most beautiful,
touching scenes of any I had seen up to that time, and for years afterward. So, for me, who had seen this movie on the big screen at a ""last run""
movie theatre the year it came out (The Harrison theatre, !937).
The scene involved George Raft (then, a well known ""movie star"" and Olympe Branda, an unknown. Mr. Raft and Miss Branda (Babsie) met in the process of boarding the ship they were sailing. It became quite clear, as the movie progressed that Mr. Raft's character(Sailor friend of G. Cooper) was determined to properly meet Babsie in a situation that would result in the developing a friendship that would develop in a romantic friendship.
In the 1937 theatre movie, she, looking for the beautiful lady she was working for, knoked on Raft's cabin door. Mr. Raft, with a deck of cards in his hand, opened the door to her knocking. She was told there was a mistake; that was not her Women's room. They talked in a very friendly manner for s few minutes. He showed her a card trick, in which a card she picked would Identify her. She picked a card he manipulted, so that it would be the
card that would help bring about the development of the friendship he was hoping for. She picked the card. The camera caught the card in full screne. We, the audience, saw the queen of hearts. He then was able to tell Babsie that (to him) she was the Queen of Hearts. ""The queen of
Hearts! That's You! The movie audience understood She understood. And I, a seven year old boy, not at that time having experienced anything
like a love experience, left the Harrison theatre on corner of Harrison and Kedzie, in Chicago; and walking home, I realized, probably for the first time in my life, the beautiful feeling of being in love.
Why someone  involved in creating  the ""Souls at Sea DVD"" chose a much cruder version of the same scene (I assume they, when they made the
theatre version of the movie, made an optional ""meeting scene"" that someone thought was ""better"" But I doubt that anyone seeing that scene in the
""Soul at Sea""  in the now-available DVDs would feel the beautiful emotions projected in the big screen 1937 version.
Note: Unfortunately, I believe the beautiful 1937 version of that scene is nowhere to be found on the planet Earth. And that makes me feel a
bit sad. George Raft and Olympe Bradna did a wonderful job. But the beauty of that scene might be lost to the human race forever.",1457136000,2,2899,4.486742424242424

7864568,3,6304153171,"""Souls at Sea"" is a riveting historical drama set among the slave trade of the 19th Century.  The film was Paramount's response to MGM's blockbuster ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and it's a worthy competitor. It has all the right elements - an interesting story based on enough facts to give it realism, a handsome leading man in Gary Cooper, who is less mannered than usual, a buddy side-kick in George Raft, who really performs in this film and creates a great character, a story-book heroine in Frances Dee, whose beauty would melt your heart, a worthy baddy in Henry Wilcoxen etc etc.  Henry Hathaway masterfully directs and there are some great scenes, not the least being the sinking of the ship at the climax.

The film has been issued in the TCM vault series and the print is excellent. There are some trivial advertising bits and a good essay from the TCM website but, like many of the DVD's in this series, the disk is faulty, jumping from reel to reel with no particular logic.  It took me 4 attempts to see the film without interruption.  TCM need to address their quality control.",1422230400,3,1086,4.606217616580311

7864571,4,6304153171,"Extremely nice print of the somewhat forgotten Cooper/Raft/Dee seafaring drama set in the 1850s.
As the tag informs us, it's licensed from Universal (holders of the Paramount library)to Eureka so
the quality is as good or better than other Universal/Paramounts of this vintage (1937. The fact it's not
available in US in this format says a great deal about what the majors are now thinking about some of their older
and less well-known films. But then,vintage film fans are getting used to trawling around Amazon.world sites to find
all sorts of US films from official studio sources popping up in England, Spain, Italy, Germany and Australia.
Henry Hathaway delivers his usual solid direction, and Gary Cooper and George Raft work surprisingly well together.
This was no Paramount B film, but an A production and comes highly recommended.",1343606400,,839,5.131386861313868
