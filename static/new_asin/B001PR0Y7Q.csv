3757413,5,B001PR0Y7Q,"The movie ""Astro Boy"" is a delight to the eye, mind and heart. The production design is especially enjoyable; from the futuristic Art Deco architecture of the floating Metro City to the open, expressive innocence of Astro's face, the film gives the viewer a pleasing visual palette unsurpassed even by Pixar. The action sequences are top-notch and inspire excitement and exhilaration, especially when Astro takes his first flight into open sky. The voice actors were well-chosen and give moving performances: in particular, Nick Cage as the grieving, conflicted Dr. Tenma and Freddie Highmore as the courageous, put-upon misfit Astro are standouts, while Kristen Bell as Astro's human friend Cora lends the character the perfect balance between tough and tender; as a happy result, Cora's confusion when she discovers her new friend is a robot, and her eventual resolve to love him just the same, are emotional highlights of the film. But ""Astro Boy""'s most significant achievement is the movie's ability to wring the hearts of its viewers. Astro inspires our sympathies with his struggles, and our cheers when he finally proves his worth. He is easily the successor to another wronged cinematic hero, Simba of The Lion King. Suffice it to say, this film deserved far more attention and praise than it got; it's easily one of the best animated films of 2009. I've seen it at the theater several times; seen, over and over, the delighted reaction to the film from children and their parents; and I would willingly see it again. And I can't wait to buy it on DVD.",1261612800,10,1561,4.961832061068702
3757414,4,B001PR0Y7Q,"While owing much to the themes presented in films like ""WALL-E,"" ""Pinocchio,"" and ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"" (the last two essentially being the same thing), ""Astro Boy"" is nonetheless an exhilarating, mature, emotional, and visually splendid animated film, successfully relying on a basic plot with heroes, villains, and morals. Its target audience is children, although I suspect they won't get much out of the social and political subtexts - save, maybe, for the idea that everyone should be treated equally even if some of them aren't human. They will, however, respond to the film's look, especially during the action scenes. They may also enjoy a few select moments of comedy relief, such as when the title character realizes that he has machine guns built into his rear end.

Adapted from the Japanese manga series created by Osamu Tezuka, ""Astro Boy"" begins with a pleasant-sounding public service announcement (provided by Charlize Theron) for Metro City, a floating futuristic metropolis where robots do all the menial things people no longer want to do. Far below them, Earth has become a wasteland of discarded robot parts, some of which are still quite usable. Living contentedly in Metro City is Toby Tenma (voiced by Freddie Highmore), a teenage genius who understands advanced physics and can rewire robots in a snap. His father, the equally brilliant Dr. Tenma (voiced by Nicholas Cage), has discovered two powerful sources of energy, one a blue core that thrives on good energy, the other a red core that thrives on evil energy. (The political implications of this are none too subtle, but it's probably best to not get into that.)

When Toby is vaporized in a demonstration gone wrong, Dr. Tenma takes it upon himself build a super advanced robotic replica, made possible thanks to a single strand of hair, a databank of Toby's memories, and the blue core of positive energy. When the new Toby activates, he discovers that his feet are equipped with rocket boosters, which enables him to fly majestically through over, around, and below Metro City. He also faces both the rejection of Dr. Tenma, who can't get past the fact that the real Toby is dead, and the wrath of President Stone (voiced by Donald Sutherland), a power hungry warmonger whose chances of being reelected depend on the blue core implanted in Toby's chest.

Both factors bring Toby to the Earth's surface, where he meets a group of lost children led by the duplicitous Hamegg (voiced by Nathan Lane), a character not at all unlike Fagin from ""Oliver Twist."" On Earth, it seems, robots are enslaved and forced to participate in brutal death matches. And much like the Flesh Fair audience in ""A.I.,"" no one really cares what happens to the robots because they're not actual people and only programmed to exhibit emotions. This, of course, is true, yet we're meant to see Toby in the same light as little David, or more fittingly, Pinocchio - a miraculously living being in search of his destiny. The thing is, Pinocchio's birth was the result of magic, not technology, so it's much easier to regard him as a sympathetic character. In retrospect, it seems a bit strange that Toby could have relatable thoughts and feelings.

But if there's one thing movies like this are good at, it's making the audience see past such things. In the moment, we're distracted by the innate desire for the good guy to win and the bad guy to lose, and in spite of his mechanical abilities, Toby is obviously the good guy here. Another thing movies like this are good at is making the action scenes spectacular; select moments are as visually creative as a well-made summer blockbuster, with high-flying camera angles, intense stunts, and stunning special effects, all of which are exciting yet not so loud or fast paced that they become assaulting. I especially enjoyed a shot of Toby digging his way underground with lightning-quick movements of his arms. In order to see, his eyes essentially become flashlights.

The general look of the film is extraordinary. Metro City in particular reminded me of the magnificent City of Tomorrow settings seen on the covers of old time pulp magazines. The characters look more or less like drawings from a manga graphic novel, especially the title character, whose expressive eyes and distinctive two spikes of hair are wonderfully cartoonish.

It just becomes a matter of story, which in this case isn't bad but also isn't particularly original. I was, however, taken by certain individual scenes, such as when Toby and his new friend, Cora (Kristen Bell), look up at the stars while straining to have an honest conversation. I also greatly enjoyed appearances by a trio of robots who operate a kind of radical civil rights organization, one that reminded me, strangely enough, of the Judean People's Front from ""Monty Python's Life of Brian."" And while the more emotional moments between Toby and Dr. Tenma are hardly groundbreaking, they're also undeniably touching. ""Astro Boy"" is by no means an unaccomplished film, but given the complexity typically exhibited in robot stories, I guess I expected it to accomplish even more.",1257811200,24,5140,4.984848484848484

3757555,5,B001PR0Y7Q,"This movie is, and always will be, my absolute favorite movie of all time.  It's an incredibly unique movie because it combines ""kiddie"" style animation and a young looking protagonist with a mature, dark story.  The beauty of this film is in the psychological/emotional heart of this film, which sadly, most kids won't be able to appreciate.  That's why this movie didn't do well in the box office - it was too mature for kids, and too kiddie-looking for teenagers/adults.  But it's SUCH A GOOD MOVIE!  Seriously!!  Watching the incredibly sweet, mature protagonist face various characters that all deal with their own serious flaws and who break his heart one by one, but who continues to go above and beyond loving these people, is really heart-wrenching but also inspiring.  My favorite part is the story arc concerning the relationship between Astro and his dad.  I find it faaaar more touching and sweet than any chick-flick movie most girls my age like swooning over.  Also, there's a bucket-load of thought-provoking subject matter that makes you think about stuff like rejection/acceptance, what makes someone ""human"", unconditional love, judgement vs mercy, peer-pressure, the human desire to be loved, the desire for meaning and purpose in life, power used to control vs power used to serve, abortion (yes, this movie has creepily similar parallels to abortion and why its wrong no matter what, a message I believe the creators didn't even realize they had inserted), and sacrifice.  And that's only the topics I can think up right now off the top of my head.
Please give this movie a chance and watch it.  Even if you don't care for the plot or animation or whatever, the main character alone is so lovable that he makes this movie worth watching.  And if you don't like Astro....well, then sir....YOU DON'T HAVE A SOULLLLL.
I give this movie ten stars out of five.",1481932800,,1877,4.905063291139241

When a boy finds out he is a robot copy of his fathers original son, he must go on the run from an evil mastermind who wants to use the blue energy inside him for a weapon. Astro soon finds himself among the misfit humans of society. But what will happen if they find out he is nothing more than a very powerful machine?",1471305600,,389,4.064935064935065
3757688,2,B001PR0Y7Q,"I think everyone can see that there is a political agenda, so I'm going to skip that part. The 2 stars is based just on the epic holes in the plot.
Toby dies because he was ""sucked"" into a robot who was powered by a negative red core. Later in the movie, President Stone is also sucked into the red core robot, but somehow comes out alive.
Metro City (a floating city) is continuously making more robots, but they never go to the surface. So where are they getting the materials to build all these things?
Astro Boy is supposedly this wonderful robot. He saves one of the villains and said villains stares at him in amazement and says, ""what kind of robot are you?"" Astro Boy is just like every other robot. Many times in the movie they refer to ""the laws of robotics."" Basically all robots have a program that prevents them from harming a human, or allowing harm to come to them. Astro isn't special- not even a little.
While Astro may protect humans, he doesn't care about robots at all. He accidentally crushes a robot (with a bigger robot) and doesn't bat an eye.  Then he gets offended to see that on the surface people force robots to fight to the ""death"".
Bottom line, it's a terrible movie. The plot isn't consistent. The story line is weird.",1470873600,,1250,4.411255411255412

3758454,4,B001PR0Y7Q,"Astroboy is a remake of an old, very popular, black and white TV show in Japan.

The movie does a decent job of re-creating the atmosphere of those shows, but more importantly, stands on it's own two feet in it's own right.

It's fast paced, full of action, and has a decent story. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it suffers from the same problems the original did. It has a very simplistic approach to very real, and complex, problems.

Warning! The following contains spoilers!

In a future where pollution and climate change have driven humanity from Earth's surface to a single city floating above the clouds, a scientist with his priorities out of whack works to create the most powerful weapon of war ever built for an unstable and unerringly stupid politician, and because of it, his precocious son, Toby, is vaporized during the first weapons test. Inconsolable, the scientist thinks he can build a 'perfect' duplicate of Toby: a robot that not only looks and sounds like the boy, but has all of his memories. Inevitably, the scientist eventually realizes that this new Toby is not a perfect duplicate, and is only a constant reminder of his catastrophic failure as a father, and rejects the 'boy' asking his superior ""Dr. Elephant"" to shut down and disassemble 'Toby'. Confused, betrayed and in fear for his 'life', Toby runs away, and escaping to the surface, which has become the ultimate landfill for the city above. There he get's his 'real' name, Astroboy, after befriending the broken robots and other beings inhabiting the littered surface.",1467849600,,1572,4.83271375464684

That's where it stops being interesting and becomes a soft propaganda device for liberal biased.

Displaying the conservative scientist has only out to save the world from the red matter.
But without regard to the danger presented to the global stability he hands the red matter over to the scientist to create a robot with the latest "" defensive capabilities"".
I almost laughed myself silly with this liberal hypocrisy. So at the end when he's firing missiles at the robot the viewers supposed to believe that a defensive mechanism?",1466553600,,648,5.240384615384615

3759325,2,B001PR0Y7Q,"Genre: Anime Super-hero
Stars: 2.5

Pros:
-Animation is good
-Voice acting is mainly good

Cons:
-Cookie cutter plot (unfortunately, it is all too common nowadays)
-The Beginning almost made me turn it off, it was that ridiculous (I know, it is anime and fantasy, but really ""I am a genius boy who can infiltrated top secret government test and killed by a government secret destroying robot...really?)
-Nicholas Cage's voice acting (it is not convincing and distracts from the movie)

I was thinking that something with such a rich history couldn't be too bad.  I was wrong.  A day or two after I watched this movie I looked up the original storyline...not surprisingly, the movies origin was completely different from the this re-boot (it sounded a lot better and more believable).  Absolutely predictable and the fight scenes were nothing special.  It was so poorly executed that I all the emotional ups and downs didn't move me at all.

It was of course a modern version over packed with horrific violence really over done for a childrens movie. Constant explosions, fires, and poor Astro boy being whooped over & over. It basically sucked. At least he had honor and courage, they kept that the same. It felt like sitting in a room listening to someone bang pots, pans, & cymbals for over an hour while lights flashed in your face. Quite annoying.",1462838400,,481,4.415730337078652

3759664,3,B001PR0Y7Q,"The birth of a hero story. Those of us who grew up a long time ago remember Astro Boy. This is the origin story retold, and it starts off hopefully enough, the main plot of the story and characters' intentions and hearts in full view, so no mystery about who is the ""good guy"" and who is the ""bad guy"". Okay, sometimes just getting to the point is not such a bad thing.

As to the story itself, this is one that flows predictably enough and holds no real surprises. For fans of animation, it is very stylized and beautifully rendered CGI. And sometimes you just want a fun story that looks really great. This delivers.

It does set up for sequels, which seem to have failed to materialize. I suppose it is safe to say we should not hold our breath. Doesn't look promising... for now.",1461801600,,783,4.319727891156463

My 6 y.o son loved this movie. I was hesitant to show him the movie due to the comments about the way the child dies, but it didn't upset him very much. Dr. Tenma tried to open the door but was unable to do so. One of the comments made it seem like he allowed the boy to die, but that wasn't the case.  My son understands death is a part of life so he was overall ok when it happened. I was put off by the way Dr. Tenma rejects Astroboy because he's not an exact replica of his son, but he realizes his mistake later on.

It's a good movie, and not too disturbing for young kids.  My son is in an adventure stage with regard to movies, so it was a blast for him.",1455235200,,672,3.847826086956522

I know this is based off a comic/anime/cartoon (which I have not seen or read), but there were a few times that certain things didn't make sense to me. My husband's explanation usually started with him saying ""In the comic/anime/cartoon ..."" and then explaining how it connects to the cartoon. Nicholas Cage's character just seemed so bleh to me and I never really connected with him.

I don't understand the negative reviews about traumatizing your children??? If your kids are so sensitive that this movie traumatized them, then I think they need to be toughened up a little. I guess they will just be the next generation of being offended and butt-hurt over everything.

""It has 4.5 stars! It has to get better!""

I wish I had looked for online reviews first: It's a solid 2.5/5. Just enough to make you go ""meh."" But I have to give it a single star, so I can maybe save other people the waste of a night.",1452988800,4,573,4.153153153153153

I am not sure that there was an adequate amount of guidance with grief for the child audience. I think that the death scene was both sudden and impactful, that it never really resolves with children by the end of the movie.

3760623,3,B001PR0Y7Q,"The voice acting by Nicholas Cage and Donald Sutherland leave something to be desired, and some of that may also be due to the deadpan expressions their animated depictions wear through most of the movie.  Similarly, Dr. Elefun, voiced by Bill Nighy, is weirdly overwrought with paternal angst, and doesn't even seem to be a scientist in this film.  The character of Toby/Astro was one of the better ones, relatively speaking, although the script kinda simplified the challenges he faced, probably to make it more relatable to a young viewer.  All in all it was pleasant but not particularly compelling or engrossing like a Pixar or Ghibli film...",1448409600,2,647,4.972222222222222

3760672,5,B001PR0Y7Q,"Knowing how badly this movie did at the box office, I was expecting something really horrible. But, it was pretty darn good. It has great animation, art direction, and a story full of ethos. There are definitely some emotional parts that might overwhelm some children. I even got misty at certain moments. Being a father, I'm always looking for things to watch with my son. He's going through an Avenger's phase at the moment. I'm a big old school Marvel fan myself, growing up collecting comic books and trading cards. This movie is way better than some of the animation that have come out recently for Marvel.

The more old school cartoons that came out in 90s were much better dealing with more realistic or darker themes. The recent ones are very superficial. Characters being emotionally flat and under-developed. (I dread watching them with my son, often falling asleep.) It could be criticized that Astro Boy doesn't change much himself, being forever wide-eyed and idealistic, however, the characters around him do change dealing with themes like prejudice, segregation, militarism, and class-warfare. Some of the character arcs are unearned, but in comparison to even some adult films, they do earn it.

And this movie definitely earns a view. Not everyone will like it, but many more will. I recommend watching the first twenty minutes and making a decision for yourself. ""Onward and upward...""",1447977600,,1404,5.047413793103448

This one exceeded all our expectations.  The ""superhero actions"" were mixed in with the dramas.  Good triumphed over evil.  The language was clean.  The violence was mostly destructions of buildings and stuff.

[Spoiler alert!]  There was one dead, but it was implied, and it was the whole premise of Astro Boy's existence.  The controversy of attempting to create human in the movie may cause some uneasiness to some people.  Parental guidance is needed in that aspect.

I watched it with my college-age children, and they loved it.  I watched it with my little nephews and nieces, they all loved it, too.",1446940800,,793,4.757352941176471

I like the analogy that it has between the island that the more privileged citizens live on while the low class live on the filthy earth in comparison to today's standard of living, and how classes are treated differently. It does give me a Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" feel, for the father created an image of his son which he loves, but shorty after regrets his decision and thinks that he has to dismantle/destroy his ""son."" There is a story of love for life and what it means to be alive. I would highly recommend this movie to friends.",1424390400,,560,4.5

Later the father rejects the robot version he made of this son and is planning to dismantle him. My 5 and 7 year-old children were so upset by these scenes. As a parent, you might want to pre-watch that opening scene so you can skip that part.  Overall its much too an emotional a story line for children. I cannot fathom what the writers were thinking - they must not have young children.

3761017,5,B001PR0Y7Q,"I had always loved astroboy as a kid and here they made a movie. I saw it when it came out in the theatre and again when I bought the DVD a few years ago. I keep watching, as it holds up over repeat viewings. I understand critics hated this film. It is a bit old fashioned, but still a great animated cartoon. It shows Astro as a warm caring creature, a hero, and a boy who finds the world a wonderful place. The city shown is beautiful and unusual, perched way up in the clouds. The film made some points about social stratification with the outlaws and non-conformists confined to the surface, a comment on elitism. It was willing to show that a technocratic future was no necessarily a perfect place. The scientists portrayed in the film were self-absorbed and often uncaring, but the scientist voiced by Nicholas Cage eventually learns better and be more accepting of differences in people. Nathan Lane's scientist was just a villain, who at first seemed compassionate but turned not to be so. I like villains who show more than one side, but Lane's scientist didn't quite make it.

3761022,4,B001PR0Y7Q,"Astro Boy (David Bowers, 2009)

I have no idea why it has taken me so long to get round to writing a few words about Astro Boy, which I watched a while back and quite enjoyed; I should mention right up front that I haven't read the manga on which the film is based, so I can't give you an exhaustive list of differences or anything like that. I just took it as a stand-alone movie, and a pretty darned cute one at that.

Bowers (Flushed Away) gives us a far-future tale where Earth has become a wasteland, and the surviving humans live in Metro City, a tamed asteroid that revolves moon-like around the planet's surface. As we open, Dr. Tenma (voice of Nicolas Cage), a well-respected, but slightly cracked, scientist (and, as a side note, the protagonist of Osamu Tezuka's smash hit manga Monster), is living in Metro City with his son Toby (voice of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Freddie Highmore). After Toby loses his life in an accident with a Tenma-created mech gone rogue, Tenma deovtes his talents to creating an android version of Toby. Long story short: he succeeds, but he cannot bring himself to think of the android as his son, so he asks his associate Dr. Elefun (voice of Hot Fuzz' Bill Nighy) to shut Toby downjust after Toby has discovered a whack of superhuman powers that have also brought him to the attention of the military. Toby, trying to avoid all comers, finds himself on Earth, an unwitting mediator between a group of outcast children who work as part-scavengers in the mountainous scrap-heaps of robot parts that now dot the earth's surface, and a group of misfit mechs who call themselves the Robot Revolutionary Front. The two groups are at odds over the kids' employer, Hamegg. The RRF claim Hamegg destroys robots, while Hamegg claims he's sending the kids out to scavenge parts so he can make robots whole again. And then there's Cora (voice of Pulse's Kristen Bell), the head of Hamegg's group of scavengers, who keeps trying to contact her family in Metro City...

It's cute, it's very well-animated, it's got a top-notch voice cast (including eleven words from Samuel L. Jackson). How can you go wrong? Of course, I could probably answer that question by reading the manga, but for what it is, I found it very enjoyable. You probably missed this in the theatersit was considered a flop, making only half of its $40 mil budget back on the big screenso give it a go now.

3761068,2,B001PR0Y7Q,"If you are a real fan of Tezuka and are into the deeper meanings embedded in his works, this movie will probably annoy you.

First, I always fail to understand how they can spend all this money on high end computers and CG and still get the art wrong. I miss Tenma's ""rooster"" hairdo and Astro's eyes were the wrong shape. Ham Egg was also much fatter than usual, but they may have done that intentionally to make him look more like his voice actor Nathan Lane (which by the way was one of the highlights of the movie as he made a very good Ham Egg).

Tenma, on the other hand, voiced by Nicholas Cage, was what I feared it would be, a non-emotional, uninspiring performance where he used the same voice inflection for every line, every situation, no matter how bad or good the action on screen was. I prefer the Tenma (Dr. Boyton) of the 1960's American Astro Boy dub over this performance; at least he got upset when his son died and actually conveyed the ""mad"" part of Tenma well. Tenma, was pretty much a boring, middle of the road kind of character and I didn't particularly care for him one way or another. I simply could not connect to him or relate to him on the level I should have. Tenma could have gotten hit by a bus and that really would not have made me feel bad for him.

Ochanomizu (Dr. Elephun in this one) wasn't bad. I think he more or less was what I would have expected him to be. Ochanomizu is generally a ""good scientist"" in Osamu Tezuka's world and he was pretty much that. Concerned with the environment, understanding and the voice of reason, I think Tezuka would have liked this version of Ochanomizu. However, you completely lose the good/chaotic mix between the two scientists with Tenma's sub-par performance.

For those who are familiar with the Tezuka Star System, the movie fell short of a chance at awesomeness by making President Stone, an almost Duke Red clone, but not actually Duke Red. If they had Duke Red play President Stone, I think this movie would have gotten a bit more interesting. However, as it stands, President Stone pretty much only shares a nose with Duke Red and lacks Duke Red's multi-dimensional personality and cunning. So, I suppose it is just as well that they did not go with a full blown Duke Red part, as Duke Red is so much cooler than that.

NOTE: the rest of this going to focus on plot points. Anyone who is familiar to the Astro Boy series will not likely be spoiled but if you prefer to see the movie yourself before I nitpick it, then you may want to stop.
__________________________________________________________

The story wasn't as horrible as it could have been, but it left out some of the subtleties that Tezuka worked into his manga and other previous installments of the Astro Boy universe. I half expected Keenan Ivory Wayans to jump up and scream ""MESSAGE!"" every time there was some lesson to be learned a la ""Don't Be a Menace to South Central..."" They didn't leave anything up to the viewer to figure out for themselves, they spelled out pretty much everything.

One example comes to us when Tenma straight out says to ""Elephun"" that he may have made a mistake and that the robot Toby is not his real son, and merely a ""replacement."" Osamu Tezuka respected the reader/viewer's intelligence enough to use the ""robot boys cannot grow"" metaphor to convey this same fact. In the original story Tenma rejects Astro because he ""cannot grow"" when in reality if the viewer digs a LITTLE deeper they can infer that this is the point when the ""mad Dr. Tenma"" has realized that Astro is not his son, and you cannot replace a human being. But apparently, that would be too much work for your average American audience and God forbid we let parents debate any plot points with curious children. So, instead they spell it out for you.  But since Cage made such a poor Tenma who never REALLY reached the classic Tenma madness breaking point, I suppose it is just as well, as such an emotional plot point would have been hard to glean from that performance.

Cage's performance also reflected poorly on the plot in general. In this version of the story Toby is vaporized by a giant, ""peace keeping"" robot, in a military experiment gone wrong at the Ministry of Science. Tenma didn't seem NEARLY as upset about this as he SHOULD have been. I mean 1) his son just got VAPORIZED and 2) it was HIS robot that vaporized him! It just didn't sit well with me at all. The choppy animation of the 1960's Astro Boy ""car wreck scene"" was more emotional and Tenma's ensuing madness made more sense. (Though admittedly the whole vaporization thing was problematic as it is anti-climatic by nature. You're here one minute then ""poof"" you're gone, not much room for drama and not much closure in that. I assume this move was made to make it less traumatizing for kids but it also made it less ""real."")

Tenma does not seem that upset while he spends, about oh... maybe a week making his new robot son (it took a year in the manga and other versions of the story which just emphasized how obsessed he really was).

This story also touched on Osamu Tezuka's environmental messages. The story begins in Metro City, a floating city in the sky which was raised to escape the garbage pile they created on earth. Metro City is shiny, new, clean, and is maintained largely by servant robots. This also felt a little like Wall-e in that respect. Ochanomizu has a dream of cleaning up the pollution they left behind on the ground below and returning to their old life.

The people dwelling on the surface, at least in the immediate area, seem to spend most of their time sifting through Metro City's trash that they throw out of the city quite literally. They never really explain why there are so many ORPHANS on the surface. Ham Egg has a collection of these orphans who he sends out in search of robots and robot parts that can be salvaged and rebuilt into working robots. (It is later revealed that he does this to win money at the ""Robot Games"" which are similar to the ""Robotting"" tournaments from the manga).

This is where some of the robot right's elements of the Astro Boy story start to play out, but do not make much progress in this movie. On the Earth's surface, Astro encounters a rag-tag band of 3 robots calling themselves the ""Robot Revolutionary Front"" (RRF). This band of communist-worker-party style revolutionaries who have posters of Lenin and Trotsky's name glued all over their hideout, are hardly likely leaders in a movement to win robots the right to be free from human ownership. In fact, they were so idiotic I'd be hesitant to give them the freedom they were fighting for, and I love robots.

This freedom from ownership is granted relatively early in the original Astro Boy narrative, partly due to Ochanomizu's efforts. However, in this movie the robots are granted little more than a brief show of appreciation at the very end of the film. As readers of the manga know, granting one's freedom is not the solution to the problem.  What really needs to change are the minds and hearts of humans. So, perhaps they decided that this was a bit too much information (or too much thinking) for your average viewer of PG rated movies.

They also used the RRF to briefly mention Asimov's laws of robotics, and there was a minor suggestion that Astro may be free of those laws due to his human memories. But other than that, they didn't go much beyond referencing the first law and avoided the complexities and issues that the other laws suggest.

One final thing that was somewhat annoying was the fact that Astro ""gives his life"" to save the city, and is promptly revived, which made the whole self-sacrifice thing a bit pointless... I also could have done without the stupid random alien attack at the end to further ram home the point that the world needs Astro and he's a !HERO!.",1332115200,4,7851,4.568585643212509

3761072,5,B001PR0Y7Q,"I didn't know much about Astro Boy when I added this title to my Netflix queue. I'm a big Mega Man fan, and I knew that Astro Boy was one of the inspirations for the video game character. Another MM fan recommended this movie, so I decided to give it a try.

After reading some other reviews and some background on the character, I will say that if you go into this expecting it to slavishly adhere to the background of the character from the TV shows or manga, you're going to be disappointed.

Dr. Tenma is the head of the Ministry of Science on a futuristic floating city-state in the clouds. He has a smart boy named Toby who he doesn't spend enough time with. Tenma and his partner Dr. Elefun are testing two opposing sources of energy housed in separate cores. The blue core is constructive energy, while the red core is destructive. Toby comes to the presentation with the President against his father's wishes, and ends up getting killed by a robot powered by the red core. Tenma blames himself for Toby's death and builds Astro as a replacement. He installs the blue core in Astro as a power source.

At first Tenma thinks he can have another chance at being a good father, but he soon finds that even though he's programmed the robot boy with all of the real boy's personality and memories, Astro is a different individual and not the same as Toby. At this point, Astro thinks he is Toby, and is hurt and confused as to why he can't seem to please his father. In his guilt and grief, Tenma pushes Astro away and tells him he doesn't want him anymore. Astro leaves feeling crushed and abandoned. In the meantime, the President has discovered the blue core wasn't destroyed as the doctors told him and sends the military to capture Astro. During the ensuing fight, Astro falls over the edge and down to the surface, where he meets some of the surface dwellers the President is trying to start a war with.

The rest of the story is Astro coming to terms with the fact that he's a robot in a world where robots are seen as mindless machines to be used and thrown away, and Tenma coming to terms with the fact that even though his son is dead, he now has another son who also needs him. Eventually the military manages to capture Astro, and Tenma has to decide whether to remove the core, essentially killing Astro.

The film has some real emotional moments. I rarely cry at animated movies, but the scene where Tenma turns his back on Astro is a real tear jerker. There are some humorous moments as well. The part where one of the secondary characters produces a feather had me laughing.

The story is well paced, and I can only think of one or two scenes that I thought dragged on too long. The action scenes are exciting, and the animation and art style is well suited to the film's setting.

There are a few things I thought could have been done better.

We only have a few minutes of scene time with Toby before he gets vaporized. And I do mean vaporized. All that is left of him is his hat. It's not gruesome since there is no blood or body, but there's no getting around the fact that he dies and he stays dead. That's kind of heavy stuff for a kid's film. The fact that he dies isn't my problem. My problem is there's not really enough time to get attached to him, which makes his death a bit less meaningful to the audience, if not to Dr. Tenma.

The film ends on a cliffhanger, which was introduced in the last minute or two of screen time will probably never get resolved due to its poor performance at the box office. I really would have preferred they had left it out.

Overall, I enjoyed Astro Boy immensely, and I'll be buying a copy for myself.",1326412800,,3665,4.35285505124451

3761076,1,B001PR0Y7Q,"How about a controversial, passionate and contradictory opinion for a change?

I always get annoyed at ""purists"" who never want to see anything altered or changed for a new generation.

In the case of Astro Boy--this box-office failure--is the best example of why America studios are not ready to embrace anime and the purists, and in this case--Tezuka's heirs--should hang on to their works and not let anyone touch them (with the exception of Urasawa).

1. Story--It takes 5 minutes of reading the original manga or watching the old anime to fall in love with Astro Boy. His eyes! His smile! The beautiful drawings--in glorious 2D!--capture our imaginations immediately.

The plot is universal. It's a humanistic/individualistic view of man, technology and life's wonderful possibilities. It's moralistic in the right way. And it's a wonderful universe for a child or young adult to live, and imagine within.

In Tezuka's anime, there are no immediate jabs at Republicans/Bush/Right Wingers/US military (although Tezuka was extremely sympathetic to many aspects of Marxism). In the film version, we are bombarded with silly, ineffectual knocks at one whole half of the American political spectrum, and while I am not personally on either side of that debate--it is damn annoying when I'm trying to get into the film. I don't care about George Bush for these 2 hours. I care about seeing Astro Boy come to life once more. Now that's he out of office, the film is even more useless in this way.

The politcal metaphors are central to the story--and have nothing to do with the original Astro. Again, Tezuka was very left of center and yet his stories WORK because anyone can enjoy them, and he was fair to both sides of all polticial viewpoints. He took his enemies at their best...even in his manga/anime--of which I own ALL english translations. (some were extremely political, but NOT astro boy)

2. Animation--Simple. 2D works for anime. That's why it's a MULTI-BILLION dollar industry world-f-ing-wide! We don't need 3D renditions of a 2D masterpiece. The form follows the function. Remember Howard Roark? The function here is not to showcase American Pixar-copy-cat crap. It's to introduce Americans to THE Japanese icon in a big way.

Astro Boy is ATOMIC. Nuclear actually. Imagine, a country is bombed using Nukes. Tezuka loses friends and family. And what does he do? He takes that technology and makes a hero out of it. That's the untold story here. And one that the true name of this anime - MIGHTY ATOM - stands for. That's the heroic spirit of the Japanese--and one that American media can't understand because it speaks to quality over quantity. Thinking over emotion.

More than this, how economically suicidal was it for the merchandisers to ignore 50 years of Astro Boy drawings/products/memorabilia and redesign the character to look..plain...un-emotional...oh and clothed!

The character designs have lost much of what made them beautiful, particularly the landscapes and robots--out of Tezuka's world.

3. This film could easily have been the beginning of something huge in re-boots of Anime classics. But until Americans bother to read and watch, more than a synopsis of what made these hits so popular throughout the world, they will keep outputting crap, and getting the voice talent to match it - Nic Cage...

In a sentence, a politically charged, emotionally impotent re-boot of something that the directors/writers neither understood nor cared for.

They got what they deserved which was... nothing...",1316995200,8,3527,5.134380453752182

3761082,5,B001PR0Y7Q,"Astro Boy may be old, but the true believers just won't let Tezuka's work die with him. Just as Lion King and Jungle Emperor Leo set hardcore animation nuts wondering just who was ripping off who, likewise many will take notice of the tributes, homages, maybe even stolen material in Astro Boy and think it's a second-rate animated flick not worthy of their attention. They couldn't be more wrong. Astro Boy was not only the best animated film of the year, but quite possibly the best FILM released that year (for a variety of reasons).

The people who ran Imagi like so many people fighting to achieve greatness, seemed to be totally clueless to the fact that no one would notice their films without a gargantuan amount of marketing when Disney and DreamWorks are around, and went right ahead and make a first-rate triple A animated film.

For the voice cast (among others) we have Freddie Highmore (gaining more of my respect with each role since August Rush), Donald Sutherland (a villain for a change), Nathan Lane (to whom I should really write a letter thanking him for all the awesome voice-acting since Titan A.E. and the Lion King movies) as the intriguing Ham-Egg (gotta love that name), Kristen Bell as the teen girl Cora, and a few other surprises (Samuel L Jackson? Oh yeah!) as well as the obvious Nicholas Cage (whose career seems to only have gone downhill from here. All of the voice acting is EXCELLENT.

The animation and art is simplistic, but beautiful, and at times, even breath-taking. Metro City is spartan, but the flying scenes have all of the energy and chair-gripping exhilaration they ought to. The world below has the lived-in mechanical wasteland motifs you would expect, while never becoming depressingly so. Bright colors are used through-out, and the overall quality to me seems JUST shy of Disney quality. Everything also has a wonderfully retro design with the elongated faces and occasional hooked noses that Tezuka is famous for. If you are a fan of old-school animation as well as CGI animation you will love the look of this movie.

The sound design is home theater demonstration quality, having a realistic aspect missing from a lot of modern animated films. And of course, John Ottman's (Super Returns) score is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. Not good. Best soundtrack of the year (this coming from me, the person who has written letter to the Prague Orchestra and has hundreds of orchestral recordings that he listens to daily). In fact, I would go so far as to say that like Tron:Legacy, the music pushes the film to new heights, greatly increasing the drama, exhilaration, and heart-warming of it's best scenes.

Personally I hate it a film wastes time explaining EVERYTHING through the course of the film. Other than the opening where you are given a short history of Metro City and the use of robots (and blue core and red core attributes) the movie lets its world and characters explain themselves (there is no explanation of ""The Three Laws""). It all feels very natural, and leaves a lot open to interpretation. Personally I love that, but I'm sure those who have gotten used to Western-style spoon-fed plot may not not like this. For instance, (spoiler alert) after the death of Tobey, Dr. Tenma says that ""he's strange"". Pay close attention. The film never says WHY Astro is unlike Tobey and leaves it up to you to figure out, but if you notice the subtle things that Astro does (still thinking he is Tobey) like telling a robot not to call him master, and the interests of Tobey before (he was fascinated with weapons) it is quite obvious. The blue core energy made Astro COMPLETELY good. He has no selfishness, no anger, no competitiveness, and no malice. Tobey was just a normal kid with the usual mix of good and bad nature. But again, this never spelled-out for you. The film is loaded with these sorts of subtle points for you to think over.

Some of the more obvious references in Astro Boy can of course be taken (as they obviously are) as pot-shots at real-world elements that run counter to the ideals of the film (A War-Mongering Politician Whose Re-election Hinges on Starting a War anyone?), but to strip the film of any references to known tropes and real world elements would likely take away some of the very things that make it such a solid piece of entertainment.

I will be honest. I'm an animation nut. I've been following animation since I could talk, and my dedication has only grown over the years. I went to see this film in the theater BY MYSELF, and I know I was the only adult who went to see it alone because of my love of old-school anime. I don't profess to be any kind of Tezuka expert, but I love the themes I have found in all the works produced from his source material (I've seen the anime Metropolis, own Jungle Emperor Leo, and love the Gameboy Advance Astro Boy). The people in that audience had all the great sci-fi and retro ideas go right over their heads, but I was thrilled right out of my skin. I saw in the theater as the End Credits rolled, soaking in the AMAZING musical score, saying to myself ""THIS is why I go to see movies in the theater and am a fan of animation.""

At the end of Astro Boy (spoiler alert) when Astro prepares to make a heroic sacrifice, I knew that the entire movie was a formulaic tribute to the ideals of Tezuka, a re-imagining went through the motions with a smile and a hug, a fan-letter to people who love all the things it embraces. I knew that there was nothing new about this movie. But I'll tell you what....I was MOVED by this film. My eyes were tearing up. And watching the phenomenal Blu Ray with it's amazing picture and sound on my 42 inch plasma at home, once again the same thing happened. If you consider yourself ANY kind of anime or animation fan you owe it to yourself to see Astro Boy. The only thing that's missing....is a Japanese Dub of the film on the Blu Ray. :)

With PDI (Ice Age, Madagascar) and Pixar (Cars, Up) fighting tooth and nail for the hearts, minds, and (especially) wallets of film-going families everywhere under the umbrella of Dreamworks and Disney, it truly warms my heart to know that despite all the hype, marketing, merchandising, and corporate meddling, an animated film that is actually GOOD can still be made. Imagi Animation Studios, established in 2000 and closed down on February 7, 2010 sought (according to Wikipedia) ""to create high-quality CG-animated feature films with superhero themes to entertain global audiences, which the company achieves by combining Hollywood storytelling with computer animation done in Hong Kong."" Anyone who saw the excellent TMNT and the wonderful Astro Boy knows that they accomplished that goal. TMNT and Astro Boy had not only great animation, voice-acting, and story-telling, but all the heart and soul that has been lacking from Western animation in the past few years. Tezuka would be proud.",1306713600,,6895,4.701158940397351

Among recent animated features, ""Astro Boy"" can seem a bit like the runt of the litter - but like most runts, it has a kind of underdog charm that makes one want to root for it.  This is particularly the case since the series - which debuted on American television in 1963 - was an important forerunner of Japanese anime, an art form that would come to its fullest flower a few decades later.

Now fully clothed and bathed in sparkling CGI color, this modern version of Astro Boy is, like his more primitive cell-drawn, black-and-white predecessor, the robotic invention of a grieving father.  When his son, Toby (Freddy Highmore), is killed in a freak accident, famed inventor Dr. Bill Tenma (Nicholas Cage) designs a robot facsimile to take the boy's place.  But Tenma soon discovers that a cybernetic creation is no substitute for the real thing, so he kicks Astro Boy out of his house, leaving him to make his own way in the world.  Thus, the adorable tyke with the rocket-fueled feet and the enviable ability to soar to great heights, dig through solid ground and lift impossibly heavy objects faces life in a society not always known for treating its robots too well.

This version of ""Astro Boy"" - sans, I might add, its catchy and familiar theme song - is not particularly impressive on a technical level; its backgrounds are mundane and its computer-animation merely adequate, but the story hits all the right buttons emotionally, allowing kids in the audience to identify with a little boy who's just been rejected by his own father and who finds that the world can be a mighty cruel place to anyone who's in any way ""different"" from the others around him.

There are evil characters aplenty - the election-obsessed President of the country (Donald Sutherland), an unscrupulous carnival barker (Nathan Lane) who promotes fight-to-the-death, gladiatorial games for robots - to keep the little guy on his toes, but it's Astro Boy's resourcefulness and sweetness that make him a fine role model for kids.  And that boy sure can fly!",1304294400,2,2047,4.8091168091168095

Both of us were bored to tears even though this film has a fair amount of action. The story is meandering first of all. Come on people, even in a cartoon/animated feature you need a coherent story. So many films such as How to Train Your Dragon, Wall.e, etc. etc. manage this. This film has no idea of where it is going. Also, here's a concept for this filmmakers, figure out the ""foreshadowing"". Even kids need this. So much is introduced with very little rhyme or reason that you loose you place. The action too is pretty standard & even tedious at times. A very similar, and slightly better film, is Monsters vs. Aliens (if you had to make a choice).

3761089,5,B001PR0Y7Q,"When you think of robot-based computer generated features, Pixar's Wall-E and Blue Sky's Robots are probably the first two to come to mind.  However, amidst the tidal waves of hype surrounding those motion pictures, Imagi Animation Studios (the guys responsible for 2007's TMNT) quietly brought Astro Boy on the scene in 2009.  It was a big budget CG incarnation of the long-running Japanese series of the same name and, in this reviewer's opinion, perhaps the best the genre has to offer.

Astro Boy, for those who don't already know, first appeared in a manga way back in 1952! There have been a whole plethora of anime incarnations throughout the subsequent decades of varying degrees of success but this CG piece has been well over a decade in the making itself; beginning back in 1999 when Sony purchased the film rights to Astro Boy from Osamu Tezuka Productions.  The plan then was to create a CG/ live action hybrid for a Holiday of 2000 release (under Jim Henson Productions).  Obviously, that plan fell to the wayside and alternate ambitions surfaces multiple times (at one point nearly securing Pixar's Brad Bird as director).

In the end Astro Boy came into fruition under the direction of Flushed Away's David Bowers for an estimated $50-million budget (that sadly recovered only about half that amount at present).  It hit Japanese theaters October 10, 2009, then made its USA debut very shortly thereafter on October 23, 2009 and finally crossed the pond once more to the UK on February 5, 2010.  It earned a stateside DVD & Blu-Ray release on March 16, 2010 by Summit Entertainment.

The story goes something like this: In the future earth's polluted, overpopulated mess leads to one city's decision to go skyward- literally.  Metro City, the metropolis surrounding Mount Sofia, a land dependent upon robots to handle day-to-day existence, uses powerful repelling technology to literally float in the clouds high above the mess that earth has become.

The viewer is introduced to Toby Tenma (voiced by Freddie Highmore) fairly early on, son of the famous Dr. Tenma (voiced by Nicolas Cage).  A prodigal child, the young boy rarely gets to spend time with his father.  Toby visits his father's workplace, the Ministry of Science to witness President Stone's (voiced by Donald Sutherland) debut of the Peacekeeper, a robot sentry that is the culmination of adaptive technology in combat applications.

An accident on the scene results in Toby's untimely demise and the heartbroken Dr. Tenma begins an ambitious undertaking like none before; he builds a robotic chassis and implants it with the memories of deceased child, taken from a DNA sample within Toby's hair.

Tragically it doesn't take long for Tenma to realize his robot son is not an exact duplicate of the boy he lost.  Convinced the only thing left to do would be to shut the robot down permanently, Tenma inadvertently crushes the robot's will and causes his decision to run away from home.

Only after ending up on the junk-pile surface of the planet and being taken in by a ragtag group of young humans can Toby discover the true capabilities of his new body and the potential within that transforms him from the mere memory of Toby Tenma into the hero Astro.

The scope of the film is marvelous through and through with direction that captures the subtle tragedy on which this franchise is based without discounting the action-heavy segments laced throughout.  Legit comparisons can be made to tales like Edward Scissorhands and Pinocchio in terms of emotional depth/ connection without ever sacrificing its own originality.

Some fans of the earlier animated efforts have voiced concern over deviations made from the source material but I am a subscriber to the theory that it's almost requisite to view this piece as a stand-alone effort as the vast majority of today's movie going target audience would be too young to remember earlier incarnations, not to mention the writers have had to condense a tale some 58-years in the making into 94-minutes.  All factors considering, Imagi does a wonderful job in capturing the charm and timelessness of the franchise.

About my only complaint to report in an otherwise glowing review, would be that Astro Boy may actually be a bit too emotionally demanding for the younger kids who are usually drawn into this type of animated film.  Make no mistake; even the death of the title character is handled completely without violence or gore (going as far as to have Toby vaporized here opposed to dying in a car wreck like the original), there is still some more heart-heavy themes here than a lot of what comes out of Pixar or DreamWorks.

The vocal cast deserves praise as well, perhaps most noteworthy being Freddie Highmore's delivery as Astro and Bill Nighy's near subliminally smooth portrayal of the good-hearted Dr. Elefun.  Although Charlize Theron, Kristen Bell, Donald Sutherland, and Eugene Levy are no slouches either! I can't even complain about the usually drab Nicolas Cage's interpretation of Toby's despondent father.

In all to say I was surprised about Astro Boy's charm would be putting it very lightly.  Summit Entertainment has nowhere near the promotional pull of Disney, DreamWorks, Sony or Universal so it's quite unlikely Astro Boy will never receive the publicity it deserves.  However, the few members of the populous who do experience this one are bound to come away impressed.",1290384000,4,5428,5.001111111111111
3761090,5,B001PR0Y7Q,"This review is a little late given that I saw this over the summer on OnDemand, but I never got around to reviewing it. I've noticed some of my favorite animated movies this decade are based off superheros (The incredibles). Astroboy was simply stunning!

 First off I'm gonna confess. I'm not too familiar with the Astroboy series. I have vague memories of a black and white anime of Astroboy (I know its way before the 80's) came on cartoon network when I was a kid (I'm a 90's baby). I didn't really get into it. Another series came on. This one was in color and I was surprised to find myself actually engrossed in it, but I still didn't know the origin or backstory of the character himself. This movie is that origin story, but not at the same time (I'll explain later).

 The story takes place in an apocalyptic future where humans live on a floating island called Metro city. While humans on the surface world live in a polluted and dangerous world, the civillians of Metro city live a comfortable and carefree lifestyle while thier robot sla-er-companions do the jobs humans no longer desire to do (because we're lazy bastards). Toby Temna the son of famous scientist Dr. Tenma (who to my surprise is voiced by Nicolas Cage) is livin life as a child star. Dispite his fame young Tobi is sad and lonely because his father often neglects him due to his work. In order to at least get a little closer to his dad Tobi reprograms the family robot Orrin and goes to the Ministry of science (Damn! Is science a religion now?). Tobi's dad isn't particular fond of his sons sudden arrival, expecially given that President Stone (dictator of the city) is visiting the lab to test out a peacekeeper robot. Tobi unknowingly make the dictator mad and is locked in a closet. To make things short. Things turn dark fast and in the end the so called ""peacekeeper"" kills Tobi and his dad looses his mind and tries to bring him back(O_O) Thus creating astroboy.

 Thats just the beginning of the movie folks. I know some people are gonna claim the makers of the movie chickened out when they didn't show a body when Tobi died, but I actually think the fact that they didn't show a body makes it all the more f-up a situation. I mean theres nothing but a speck of dust for the father to hold onto and nothing to bury. I think the fact they even killed tobi is ballsy given that not too many animated films today would even go THAT far. I have to agree with one reviewer though about Tenmas emotions when Tobi died. I think it could have been a better performance and more convincing, but I think his denial and the scenes where he loses it trying to make Astroboy makes up for it. One thing I REAAAALLLY have to agree on though is that it would have been great if they developed Tobi's character more. The audience barely gets to know him before he dies makin his death tragic to the dad, but less tragic for me.

 One thing I really need to comment on is how this movie looks. It has some of the most human lookin characters I've seen in a long time and hollycow does the scenery-o look amazing. I'm usually against anything being in 3d but I can't imagine how kicka** this movie looks in theatres. You know whats even better? This would have been extremely popular in IMax. Them flying scenes look cool and exciting enough on a high definition flat screen TV, how about that x500 in an IMax theatre?!

 Not only did I love the look but the story. Its really dark how Astroboy is brought into the world only to have his dad say ""get the **** out"" (he doesn't really say that, but he might as well have). Not only that, but seek to destroy him. Who says kids movies can't be more mature? Its interesting seeing Astro strive to find a place where he can fit in. That one dude who takes care of the orphanage children, man did they give him a twist I didn't see comin. I love how it's not only dark, but its not afraid to add twists that makes the main characters situation worse. Not sinse Secret of NIHM and Plague Dogs have I watched a kids movie where everything that could go wrong with a main character does go wrong.

 Remember earlier where I said this is an origin story, but not at the same time? Well it came to my attention that Astroboy also had a manga series (japenese comic) that is apparently different from the origin story of the movie. I understand how anyone whos read the original source material will be disappointed with this movie (I've had similar experiencesXD), but you must give it credit. It made those who knew nothing about the original material curious enough to at least research or look up the character and have it be wider known. Plus they did it in a way that didn't butcher the original source material to the bone (coughlastairbendercough)

  Its hard to believe this movie isn't more known. I guess it was bad marketing ploys. I recall rarely seeing commercials for this and really I don't think I saw much advertisement for it period. Astroboy is no doubt one of my top ten CGI animated movies. I recommend it to all.",1289865600,3,5047,4.423491379310345

This film just doesn't capture the feel of that show and even though the animation isn't bad, it also isn't all that great. I don't mind remakes when handled with care, but this one seems uninspired and almost pointless. Sure I want to see Astro Boy with all the advances made to animation, but lets do it with an inspired story and people who give a hoot. It's actually a boring movie, which should never be the case when you're talking about an animated film....or any film for that matter! Astro Boy bombs away? Yep!..

3761100,3,B001PR0Y7Q,"First of all, I'm a huge Astroboy fan, so make sure you are relaxed, are enjoying a cup of tea or coffee and would like some interesting reading to stimulate you, as you read this review. I'm in no rush, as I write it. I have all the anime's in my library, including many of the Japanese VHS tapes and have watched them allot over the years, even though I've not been a boy in over 4 1/2 decades. They still are great fun to watch at any age!

Now you already have the current summary write-up given by Amazon.com on what the film is about. I think it is ridiculous to re-hash a story summary already supplied by the seller, when I write a review on Amazon.com. Rehashing the summary should not be the purpose from those of us who write these reviews and have seen a film or read a book being offered. Who needs the repetition? How boring! However, here are some things I would have liked to have seen happen in this film that never did happened.

Second of all, the plain fact about this film is that it failed at the box office level: Something that should not have happened. A friend of mine said it would have done better, if it had been released in early summer, not when the kids went back to school. I don't fully share his view, although that MAY have helped box office sales some. Before I begin, I want it said that I think there are allot of pluses to the story David Bowers scripted out. It is still a fun film to watch, in spite of what I'm about to say about it.

When I get in touch with the side of me that is still a boy, still alive under all the worlds ""crap"", after living in an aging body over half a century old, while asking that boy why it failed at the box office; I think that boy has some interesting things to say about this film and what disappointed him the most in his expectations. I also don't think it was the use of CGI graphics that took away from the charm of this motion picture either. I think everything was beautifully handled with the computer graphics, for the most part, in high praise to the artisans who did all the rendering work. It was a job well done for the most part. There is also allot going for this film in praise to David Bowers work, BUT the initial spiritual premise of this film hits a pitfall right from the start.

To start this review, I have to look back to when we were kids in the 1960's. Many of us; who watched and loved Astro, wanted to be Astro: I myself use to day dream, as a boy, about being born as Tobio and then being transferred into the Astroboy body, while preserving my human experiences in that transfer. I know, I was weird, but then I even remember things I knew before I was born back in those days. I suppose my dream of becoming Astroboy sounds a little like Robocop the movie, where a human head is preserved and attached to a robot body. That was an ugly approach to me. I'm acknowledging the existence of the soul and taking all focus off the flesh in my day dreams as a boy. I've always been a spiritually minded person, since the day I was born, which had nothing to do with my upbringing either in the Catholic Church.

Anyway, always Osamu Tezuka alluded to the idea of the soul of Tobio being transferred into the Astroboy body throughout his work, even though he borrowed story themes from western novels when he wrote his own stories. I suppose he borrowed story themes like he did simply to say; ""why reinvent the wheel when it has already been invented?"" Also, this idea of soul transference was directly addressed in the 2004 anime series in a number of the episodes, but not clearly made evident, as the series developed except at the end.

I've been a scholar of the arts, sciences and religions of the world all my life. Anyone who knows past Japanese and Chinese history knows there is heavy influence from Buddhist teachings in these cultures. All of this originates from the Vedic teachings of India, like the Upanishads, as those teachings migrated into China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Tibet over the centuries. This was before Japan became heavily westernized over my life time, which was not so when I was a boy. As Japanese and Chinese technology invaded the Americas back in the 1960's, so did the teachings of Zen Buddhism.

The singing group, known as ""The Beatles""; also helped bring these Vedic cultural influences into the Americas of that day and my generation. When you know this about the history, it is clear that the idea of ""reincarnation"", which is taboo in the western cultures, has had a heavy influence on those other cultures. The subject of reincarnation is taboo in the Western cultures, because of the heavy ""fundamental Christian"" influence in the West. It was especially so, back in my day as a boy, but without it, you lose a needed, logical avenue; that makes it possible for kids to empathically connect to characters they saw on the ""big screen"" back in those days. These inflected spiritual truths were further alluded to in television series like ""Lost in Space"" and Irwin Allen's ""The Time Tunnel"", with ""The Time Tunnel"" being a very sophisticated show for its time. Forth dimensional math was not something an audience raised in the 1940's and 1950's was ready for, but my generation was. The same is true with Stanley Kubrick's  ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" where the film ends showing the infamous ""star child"" in the birth sack; indicative of reincarnation of the soul. Allot of people always blow it in understanding that ending, because they do not take the time to understand the writer and what influenced his writing. I'm talking about Vedic teachings like the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita.

You learn that even Jewish mysticism, as revealed in the Sepher Yitzerah, Zohar and Kabbalah, teaches reincarnation and so does the Christian Bible in the Passage taken from Matthew 17:10-13 where we learn that John the Baptist is the reincarnation of Elijah the Prophet. Naturally, you don't hear Christian fundamentalists teach from this text, because they feel it is directly in opposition to the idea of all of us being resurrected one day into the same body we were born in.  I love what Thomas Melin Benedict revealed when he died from cancer for 90 minutes, as he toured the Universe after death and how he was shown that reincarnation is part of the deal. He also asked the reader the question; ""What do you think was going on with souls before Adam and Eve were created and before God took on the name of Jesus for mankind?"" Betty Eadie makes it clear in her book; we were all around when this world was first created billions of years ago. In my own life's review, with my first death encounter at age 25, I was shown by our Lord that I am a very, very old soul. What I was exposed to gets lost in the translation of trying to put it all into our own language you should know. Death has to be experienced to be fully appreciated and understood.

Well, regardless of each person's spiritual influences as they grew up, I don't think there is one boy I knew, when I was a boy, who loved Astro, who didn't want to be born as Tobio, only to wake up one day as Astroboy and as such would fantasize about being the famed robot hero. These other cultural and spiritual influences helped make for a mind set that could accept such fantasy roles, which is why I bring it all up in this review. You had to have been alive back then to know what I'm talking about. Same goes for the girls who loved Astrogirl.

These days, we seem to be a world that is getting more and more caught up with our empty material creations, which have no life in them and are moving more and more away from our true spiritual origins in my view. This will only lead to the destruction of our civilized cities. Bowers makes this point clear in this movie, as he shows the earth all used up from man's pollution.

""Our bodies are on loan"": This idea was heavily promoted in the 1960's and 1970's when Eastern teachings started to penetrate into western thinking; which made those time periods, not only magical in their revelation discourse of the human spirit, but because they appealed to the soul-side of man, which made product merchandising successful as well. The more flesh minded this world gets, especially with sex, the more merchants fail at the retail store level with moral toy products; simply because they are not appealing to the spirit side of man; in line with truths that are far above even the fundamental Christian beliefs these days. This line of insight is what defines the true definition of decadence, like we see in the great empires of the past that finally failed, the most predominant being the old Roman Empire.

The more this current generation departs from this premise of our eternal existence, the more the world steeps into more and more darkness and more emptiness, even in the merchandising side of the equation. Too much affluence leads to a lack of imagination in any society when you review history and the United States is becoming guiltier of this sin against the imagination as we age as a nation. This sin against the imagination is what also contributed to the box office failure of this film. We simply have lost that generation with the great imaginations we had in the 1970's, which was my generation, who would have loved films like this one. I'm becoming a dying breed at my age: Just about extinct as I write this. Even recent films like ""The Last Mimsy"" fail to capture the audiences of today that would have been captured in the 1970's, simply because people are more interested in shopping till they drop, than they are searching out the deeper truths of the Universe; like it was in my day, as a young boy and teenager.

Kids need to EARN the answers taught in their story books, not have it spoon fed to them by a computer. So while sci-fi books and comic books are great in teaching the lessons, children still need an active playing field where they can play out the variables, which is more non-existent these days with this current generation. These days, with computers and their designers doing everything for us, people have forgotten how to think and create for themselves all the more, which is sending our nation into decline, as a result. Perhaps when we finally fully collapse financially, as a nation, all of those old ways will be re-birthed among all of us. Nothing is earned anymore by the individual, except a high credit card debt for all the junk they buy over a life time. In spite of the debts we create for ourselves, we still wind up empty, spiritually, as we age, having lost the real lessons of life in the loving and understanding of each other. Bower's film would have scored big points in the 1970's when you can see all of this, but these days it appeals to a generation who has forgotten or abandoned the high spiritual values that helped make America great.

With all that said, I think Bower's script would have gone much better, if David Bowers had reviewed the 1960's anime version more, concerning Osama Tezuka's work and had gotten more into the ""spirit"" of his work; literally. Understand; I'm not knocking Bowers. He's a fine director and his years of lesson learning show on his slightly care-worn face, when you see him interviewed.

However, in the scene, in Bowers Astroboy movie; where the Peacekeeper robot obviously absorbs Tobio, before Dr. Elefun uses the blue core cable to shut down the Peacekeeper robot, which also kills Tobio in the bargain, I would have written that scene a little differently; even as a boy. A better scene would have found us seeing Tobio running to the back of the warehouse, at his father's beckoning, to escape the power of the Peacekeeper, when the explosion takes place. From there, we would learn that Tobio is badly hurt and barely alive. We would then see his father, Dr. Tenma, taking his nearly dead boy into his lab where he has been working on the new Astroboy body, having modelled it after his own son.

This issue of transferring the soul into a robot body was brought out in the 2004 anime series, but like I said, it needed more development. The avenues available in the script, once you take that route, as the writer, are intriguing; to say the least, especially with sequels. I would have then written into the story, ahead of time, a brief discussion between Dr. Elefun and Dr. Tenma, that Tenma had been working on the ability to transfer the human soul into a perfect robot body, with Astroboy about to be his crowning achievement to mimic the work of God with a fully synthetic body that could carry a living spirit in it. If I were in the spiritual realm, I would have volunteered for the role as Tobio you should know. What an experience! Dr. Tenma's ability to do this was certainly brought out in the 2004 anime series near the end of the entire series of episodes where Tenma talks with Shadow, telling Shadow that he created Shadow, so that Shadow would transfer Tenma's soul into the body of a robot, so he might ""serve by the side of his son over the earth forever as father and son"". Buy the 2004 anime series, if you want to learn more about what I'm talking about.

So why was the premise of soul to body technology ignored in this full length feature CGI film? Bowers and his CGI team could have continued their good story line, now turned great, just about as is, but with the twist where we, the audience, have watched Tobio actually become Astroboy! His film would have made more sense, as the story progressed! This would have followed the spirit of the Pinocchio premise also, where Pinocchio goes from a puppet to a real boy, while always being himself spiritually, at the soul level, regardless of the body he was in. This would have captured more, the hearts of Bower's young audience; if Bowers had caught the vision of this correctly from the start. I was especially fascinated by the transformation of Pinocchio, from a wooden puppet to a real boy, when I was a boy. Why not the reverse with equal fascination? This is how kids think.

Even the three times the ""blue fairy"" appears in the story of Pinocchio, you have to be blind not to see how those three appearances come from Christian culture? The blue fairy represents three transitions of consciousness Pinocchio must go through to prove himself worthy of being a ""real boy"" in the flesh. The first transition is from lifeless matter to live matter with a flesh conscience apart from soulish conscience. Read the work of Teilhard Chardin to understand what I'm talking about here. The second transition is his deliverance from his sin with Stromboli and the temptation to embrace all manner of lies told to him by Honest John, the fox. The third is the test of whether he will give his life for another, in this case for his father at the end, to prove the noble nature of man. Like the good fairy said to him; ""Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish and one day you may be a real boy"".

In each case the blue fairy represents first; the Father who gives life in the first appearance, defining Pinocchio's bravery and courage to take on life; second, the Son of God who takes away sin defining Pinocchio's truthful side and third, the ""Holy Spirit"", the great helper, in her third appearance as a dove where Pinocchio must prove himself unselfish, as he gives his life to save his father's life.

When you see this, you can see the writer was heavily influenced by Christian teaching when the story was written and this is why the book remains an all time classic, because it embraces the Biblical teachings as well as it does, with a waiting audience back in my day and even before the 1950's. Since Astro is also based off of the Pinocchio formula, to break away from that perfected formula of success in the selling of the story; is asking for trouble from any audience and I think this is where Bowers blew it in writing the story line with his script. In the end, face it, kids want to be Astroboy or Astrogirl when they watch Astroboy. Not to see this is to be blind to what goes on inside the minds of children when they fantasize. This is also true of those who like Batman, Superman, Spiderman and so forth from American culture.

What I have in mind would have required a very simple rewrite of the master script Bower's wrote. Otherwise you could just leave the rest of the script the way it was written for the most part. The mythology of good vs. evil; where evil becomes this Peacekeeper robot, bloated with too much of itself, consuming everything in sight to satisfy itself; while good becomes this dwarfed, all giving, but powerful, humble force, is a universal message in all the religions of the world. It also makes for good screen action at the end in the battle scenes. I enjoyed all of that very much: Very predicable at my age, but loads of fun to watch; regardless. Also the story works pretty much in accord with the standard hero's journey format.

In every hero's journey; the hero always walks into his or her destiny, not even wanting the journey or even seeing it coming to change his or her life. In this case, the hero's journey begins where Tobio dies. In that death, which is a physical death; he spiritually awakes to a new and more powerful body, ready to explore his great powers. In this case, each thing thrown at Astro from then on, though brutal to watch, makes him realize his incredible physical powers, but also awakens him to an inner wisdom of kindness and love toward all that he meets. This marks the true good of any hero. This is not only the ""testing in fire"" each hero goes through in all the Greek tragedy stories, as well as the stories of the Bible, before he or she has to fulfil their divine purpose in life; but it also serves as a spiritual revelator the hero must past through, if he or she is to recognize their destiny, which Astro finally does in the end. Bowers has done his homework well, for the most part, with the way he wrote the story. It's a good story line, but not great, for the sake of the missing premise I'm sighting in this review.

Finally, Astro is rejected by his creator, Dr. Tenma, who is disillusioned at first by his own robot creation, only to realize later that his creation is truly good and worthy of his love. So, Dr. Tenma ""grows up"" along the way, as well, in his role as a ""god-type"" figure: A lesson man needs to learn, should he one day succeed to this level of ability in perfecting AI technology. With current day technology advancing like it is, a real Astroboy could be walking around on this earth one day, even if that is a hundred years from now. We won't see it in my generation, as to what the realities of AI could become one day, but it could happen.

It's all a good moral message on the subject of what defines life too, whether your body is synthetically made or organically made. Anyway, in Bower's movie, after Astro is rejected by his dad, he is further tested to make him face his physical powers, while President Stone is busy trying to capture the ""rogue"" robot named Astroboy. Then when Astro falls to the earth, after enduring a horrendous near nuclear explosion to destroy him, in President Stones efforts to claim back the ""blue core"" (Astro's soul); Astro learns true humility being with other outcasts, like himself, to help perfect his loving nature. I very much loved this transition in the story line: Great teaching tool for the young to learn from. We also see Astro demonstrate his love toward all life along the way, whether that life be organic based or synthetic based. All sentient life is respected by Astro; that is unless his own existence is threatened along the way by other robots, until he learns the ultimate sacrifice in the end where he gives up his own life to take out the Peacekeeper robot to save Metro City.

Once Astro has finished his sojourn on the surface of the earth, he is brought back to his home to be executed and experiences his first ""death and resurrection"" in obedience to his father's will, when Dr. Tenma has to take away his blue core, the source of his existence. Funny too, Edgar Casey said the soul of each of us is located in the center of the chest, when you read Casey's readings recorded by Dr. Lammers and his team from the 1940's. What we think is a ""heart ache"" is really a ""soul ache"" when we feel emotional pain in the center of our chest in other words. So when I watch Dr. Tenma take the blue core out of Astro's chest to give it to President Stone, with that in mind, it's like God taking away the soul from the body.

In all, Tobio dies three times and is three times ""resurrected"" in this movie which connects us again to the Bible and the significance to the number three, oddly enough, represents the trinity taught in the Holy Bible. This also tells me Bowers is being influenced in his writing by some exposure to Christian teaching, more than he may be aware of, as a writer. Pinocchio certainly had that influence in its structure when you study the structure of the story. Still, the first resurrection is a disconnected one in Bower's script, because Tobio dies in Bowers film with only his strand of hair making it possible to preserve Tobio's memory. In my version of the script, we would have seen Tobio's soul transferred into the Astroboy body, thus putting more sense to the three resurrections in the film's story premise, in parallel to the storyline of Pinocchio.

We also learn that Astro can break his wrist restraints any time he wants, after he is captured, but stays in strict obedience to his father's will, even to the point of death. We are reminded of Jesus going to the cross, in obedience to His father, to the point of death, only to be raised again by His father, once he has proven His obedience in this scene. Astro then rises, in a ""second"" resurrection, given by his father, only to do final battle with the one Dr. Tenma was to give Astro's soul to, President Stone; who we finally learn is an evil man, ""absorbed"" with his own self glory and not the welfare of the people who he is suppose to rule over. I suppose you could define this as the ""Devil in the mix"" needed to create the final tension in the end which makes for good screen action in the final battle of the story.

I do love the old plot lines being re-embodied in this storyline I might add. It's the old, ""battle it out to the end, good vs. evil plot line, and blow everything to hell, until good wins"" scenario. Even at my age, I enjoy it in spite of its predictability and the gags thrown in, to move it along.

Bowers has a good sense of humor, in my view, with many of his gags. My favourite gag is the part where Astro uses a huge I-beam that weighs tons, to hit over the head; of the way too big Peacekeeper robot and gets the response; ""That all ya got?"" while the Peacekeeper spits out a tooth from the blow he took. Way too funny a scene! I couldn't stop laughing with that one. Then Astro clenches his fists, as if to say; ""No, that's not all I got. I'm going to beat the heck out of your chin!"" which is about all he can do; given how big the Peacekeeper robot has become, as it becomes too full of itself, which pure evil always does.

Like I said earlier, Astroboy was a take off of the old Pinocchio story plot line where a wooden puppet becomes a real boy. Alan Ladd, key animator of the old 1960's animes, tells this, if you ever buy the old anime series from the 1960's. In Astro, we have kind of the reverse, where a real boy becomes a puppet boy, or a ""robot boy"" in this case, only to find that it is not the body that defines him, but that Tobio has been given a chance to learn his high spiritual side more, which is what defines the true heart of man's existence. This message is lost to some degree, in my opinion, because the idea of Tobio becoming Astro has not been established early on in the film. The idea that Dr. Tenma uses a strand of his son's hair to re-create the memories of Tobio, did nothing for me: That's not even good science, even though the cells of each organic body on the planet has the DNA to recreate the entire body, if needed. However, our memories are not stored in the DNA, only the replication of our body is stored. Too much bad science and not enough of the spirit side of the Universe was introduced to balance this thing out. This was a major mistake, in my view, Bowers made when building the premise early on with the story line.

Take any of these great truths away from the Astroboy script and you get the reason why this thing failed at the box office like it did. Even if you compare this to Pinocchio, at all times Pinocchio was always himself, whether in his puppet body or his real boy body. That consistency was lost in this film and it killed the spirit of the film in a big way as a result. Too bad too, because when films like this fail in this way, we don't get the fun of watching successful selling sequels made and I would have enjoyed seeing this made into sequels, which obviously won't happen now, simply because it didn't even break even at the box office.

Remember, you have to think the way a 2 to 7 year old is going to think, having never seen these plot lines before. Too often I think kids have more sense in separating good and evil in their minds than adults do. Anyway, to these young kids, it's all new when it comes to life's plot lines. To old scholars like me, its old news. Films like this are always made for the young generation and not old fogies like me. Still, the kid I once was is still alive inside me, which helps me to enjoy these films when they come out, even at my current age.

In the end, Astro is faced with the greatest sacrifice of all. First he must subject himself in obedience to his father's will to win over his father's love and then in the end he must sacrifice himself, to the point of death, to save Metro city and clear it of the evil Peacekeeper robot. Again, we see allot of the Bible in this story writing. So we have two deaths and two resurrections in this film script concerning Astro's climb to ascended mastery, minus the one death of Tobio with vague reference to a resurrection in order to become Astro in the beginning of the film.

Following the plot line of Pinocchio, we see Astro birthed from a real boy, the reverse we see in Pinocchio; where Astro's father gives him life, unlike the blue fairy in Pinocchio who represented the spiritual realm. Kind of a sign of the times indicating we live in a more secular humanistic world vs. a more spiritually minded way of looking at things over half a century ago.

Astro then shows divine love, toward his father, to help his creator understand His creation's worth. This results in a second death and resurrection happening to Tobio, who should have also been Astro, to prove Astro has learned full obedience to his creator's will which fully touches the heart of his father-creator, Dr. Tenma. He is then rewarded with a second resurrection, because of his pure goodness. When he finally sacrifices himself for the good of mankind in Metro City at the end of the film, Astro experiences a third death and resurrection. So we are reminded of the good fairy's words; ""Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish..."" This draws us back to the old story of Pinocchio again, as Astro proves himself ""unselfish"" in the scheme of things. The mythology is very good in this movie for the most part. We even witness Astro's ""life's review"" which you hear talked about in most Near Death Experiences these days, as Astro dies inside the Peacekeeper's red core near the end of the film, in order to destroy pure evil with his pure goodness. We see his short life was a life devoted to real love, no matter how badly he was treated.

So while Astro's life appears to be ""short"" when he gives his life to save Metro City, he is raised yet a third time to an even higher level of understanding with his third resurrection in the film. Astro has become even more loving and grateful for the gift of life when this happens, just like Pinocchio was when he finally became a real boy. The great messages sent to kids about bravery, self sacrifice, righteousness and divine love are all taught in this film, which makes this a wholesome family entertainment product worth watching many times. It also makes for good discussion afterwards, with your kids, who view the movie and the story it tells.

There are about a dozen technical glitches throughout the CGI rendition of the movie you may not catch with the first viewing. The most obvious is which side Astro's forward spike is located. At one moment it may be above his right eye and in the next scene, it is above the left eye. Apparently there were two production teams who failed to talk to each other involved in the making of this film, when this was all being rendered. (chuckling)  It makes for a humorous, if not the annoying, constant shifting of the spike on the top of Astro's head, once you catch the error in the production side of the film.

Other minor flaws would be when President Stone sends the ""Spirit of Freedom"" rockets at Astro to try and destroy him to collect the ""blue core"" in Astro's chest for Stone's own agenda to be re-elected as President of Metro City: Where Astro's clothes should be burned off his body in this scene, they stay neat and in tact through the scene. I would have preferred his clothes be burned off when the missiles hit him, so we can see him in his black leotards, green belt and red power boots, the way we all remembered him in the old anime's. This was a perfect time to ""undress him"" and show his memorable side from the past, in other words. This also would have avoided the other error that comes when Astro has to use the machine guns from his butt later on. Normally, when those guns appear, they should have torn right through his jeans, but instead the animators have his pocket flaps neatly fold up and down when the guns appear and retract. In real life, the reality is the guns would have torn right through his pants, leaving holes. If he had shed his clothes earlier, then everything would have been prepared for Astro when he has to use his machine guns on the Peacekeeper robot. I'm sure Bowers kept Astro in his civilian attire to get Astro through the scene when he meets Hamegg and his other friends, who think Astro is a real boy. Still, there were opportunities to develop these areas better to capture more what real life would be, given how well the CGI graphics were done to mimic real life throughout the story.

Another blunder in the script is where we see Tobio absorbed by the Peacekepper robot as a human, only to be killed when the blue and red core come together, but in the case of President Stone, who was also absorbed by the Peacekeeper robot, he doesn't get killed when the blue and red core come together at the end. Talk about inconsistency with this one! I guess you can sum this up in the words; ""While you can't keep a good bad guy down, the good always die young"".

Here's another interesting observation as well, thanks to a talk I was having with an old college friend of mine; who saw the movie. The old laser recorders on the market use a red laser light vs. the new ""blue ray"" laser light now in the market. So it is clear Bowers was being influenced, as a writer, by today's technology and captured it in his writing; hence the ""red core"" and ""blue core"" orbs used in the film; with the blue core becoming the soul of Astro in the end.

I would have loved to have given this five stars. The production quality is certainly worth the five stars, but the main weaknesses in the script, I talk about, is a major weakness that my inner boy just didn't like. Tell a boy he can't wear those rocket powered boots, have machine guns come out of his butt or turn his arms into cannon powered lasers and right there you've lost your major audience of dreamers who long to be Astro. (chuckling) You also blow it at the merchandising level at the same time. Makes sense doesn't it? But only if you are in touch with your forgotten boyhood it seems.

I still would purchase this film for its overall message and action content. I may not live long enough to see a live action version of the movie, but I hope that whoever gets that job, will finally realize; young boys and girls want to be these characters and only when you incarnate Tobio into the body of Astro, will the writer finally get the premise right. Whoever finally gets that right, will make a killing at the box office, providing the other issues of the hero's journey are properly addressed in the script writing.

3761113,1,B001PR0Y7Q,"When I purchased this movie, I had it in mind to watch it with my 3-year-old son, which I did. My son liked it ok, but I was put off by it. The coldness of the characters (especially the human characters) brings a whole new meaning to the term ""uncanny valley,"" which traditionally means something intended to look like a human, but falls short in such a way that looks creepy. In this case, it applies to the emotional aspects of the characters, rather than the physical.

(The following paragraphs contain SPOILERS for early scenes in the movie).

You never really get to know Toby before he dies, so it's easy to emotionally detach yourself from his death. My son was not so disturbed by it as he is too young to understand much of the plot. Despite the cold, detached way the movie portrayed these scenes, I was disturbed. Not because of the death of Toby, mind you. I was disturbed as a father whose greatest fears are portrayed in this movie in a way I can't empathize with. It made me feel uncomfortable to be so detached. Add to that the fact that the writer/director chickens out on Toby's death and makes him just disappear, literally in a flash of light, so that it takes a few moments to understand that he died. Toby's father, Dr. Tenma (a very blah Nicholas Cage) doesn't react to Toby's death in a way that makes the death (let alone his reaction to it) seem believable. All you get from him is, ""Where's my son? Where's Toby,"" spoken in a tone that reminds me of Willy Wonka's, ""Don't. Stop. Come back."" Then he forces himself to whimper over Toby's hat. There is no funeral; no semblance of actual grieving before Dr. Tenma is seen creating a robotic replacement some days later.

After a couple of short scenes with Dr. Tenma and Astro Boy at home (not spending much time with eachother, though), and with no further character development, Dr. Tenma rejects Astro Boy for not being like Toby. His explanation being that something is different about him -- he's not Toby.

What the heck?! They seemed the same to me! There was no way to know what was so different about Astro Boy that he could just throw him out like that. He was the same kid! Sure, he was modified with rockets for feet and machine guns that stick out of his butt so that he can escape death, but otherwise, Astro Boy seemed just as human and boy-like as Toby or any other boy in this celluloid universe. These characters have no soul.

In the original comic book, Dr. Tenma was more harsh toward Astro Boy and chased him away with a shovel. I think I would have preferred that, because then you at least have some semblance of REAL EMOTION. When compared to coldly telling him ""I don't want you,"" the comic book showed Dr. Tenma as a human who is suffering from his failed attempt to cope.

In the movie, the characters merely react to their emotions, but do not express them in a way that makes their actions seem genuine.

If you ask me what was good about this movie, it's the fact that my son loved the robots, the Astro Boy character, and I can't say he was distressed about any of the events in the movie. Ham Egg (Nathan Lane) was one of two characters that I felt had substance. He reminded me a bit of Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars. The other character of substance was Dr. Elefun, who seemed to be the only person with any real emotion or conscience, but no guts. There are also a couple of impressive scenes that exhibit the environment, as well as Astro Boy's powers, but other than that, the movie was just a dud.",1274054400,7,3516,4.416666666666667
3761114,5,B001PR0Y7Q,"In a cinematic world of direct to video cheap SciFi, god awful horror remakes, or mindless schlock winning this year's Oscar, it's nice to see that something like Astro Boy gets made. Once in a blue moon a picture will be released and because of lousy promotion its out of the theater before you know it. After having bought the DVD, I could not believe how good this movie really is. Even though this movie is 3D animated and aimed at kids, it has a maturity all its own to appeal to adults. Don't get me wrong, it extremely tame possessing only very mild violence and no offensive language.
The story is simple. A professor's son dies and he makes a robot boy to replace him. Because the professor wanted to recreate his own son, Astro is eventually rejected by him due to the fact that he really isn't his son. That's when the story takes off and we follow along with Astro Boy's adventures. It ends with a confrontation with a big evil robot controlled by an overly ambitious politician after Astro Boy's technology. Certainly, the story is predictable in nature, but its pacing, characters, and light hearted sentiments make an interesting enjoyable journey.
These days 3D rendered movies are standard kids fare. In this case, the subjects of the film are transcended into a techno fairytale that is beautiful to watch. Originally, Astro Boy was an animation adapted from Japanese Comics that came over with the likes of Kimba, Speed Racer, and Gigantor. Maybe its poor peformance in the theater had something to do with that connection to Speed Racer that was adapted to one of the worst movies made this century. Astro Boy is not anything like the Speed Racer movie and is like a shiney silver dollar that you never knew you had. Check out this wonderful gem of a picture!!",1273276800,8,1780,4.653968253968254

3761118,1,B001PR0Y7Q,"Astro Boy is a contrived, incongruous, muddled pile of steaming drek. I'd add sanctimonious too, but before you can have sanctimony, the movie would need a coherent message. Mr David Bowers, you not only owe me the 90 minutes of my life spent watching this vapid drivel, but the countless hours I will no doubt have to spend un-sticking the residue of your movie from my child's world view.

It isn't just the moral confusion of this film, but the overall shallowness therein. I read now that this is an adaptation from a Japanese Manga series. That makes sense, because this movie acted like it was trying to pack a novel into a 90 minute montage. At the end of the film, the writers expected you to care about characters who've had all of 3 lines and pretty much no development. Perhaps intriguing messages are given the barest (often contradictory) treatment.

Somewhere buried in the cardboard performances of Nick Cage, Donald Sutherland and even Samuel Jackson (who plays a bit part) I'm sure there was an attempt at a message. Perhaps it is ""Be good to the environment"" because the movie starts off explaining to us that the world was long abused by humans, some of whom escaped to a utopian floating city where they live a life of paradise on the backs of Robots. But then, we never follow up from that initial message. Indeed, later as the movie progresses, we see that the surface is full of rolling green fields and bright sunny days.

So maybe the message is, ""Treat everyone equally."" We see that the robots of this world are mistreated and discarded like so much trash. And yet, I can't see how the writers expected us to feel sorry for the robots, since 90% of the comic relief comes from slapstick ""Robot gets smashed"" routines. So we go through scene after scene laughing at the wanton dismemberment of hilarious robot victims, only to then be told that the mistreatment is horrible...followed by another dozen scenes of hilarious robot explosions?

Maybe its that Communism wasn't such a bad thing after all. The Robot Revolutionary Front is a lighthearted trio of robotic misfits that repeatedly call our attention to the plight of Robots. Their headquarters is filled with posters lauding Trotsky and Lenin, and they courageously attempt to help the hero at every turn. Of course, the message seems to be that these guys are benign incompetents (as every such attempt ends unsuccessfully) which, if their intention, is an outright atrocious misrepresentation of Communism (you know, that system of government that killed 100 million+ people over the last 100 years?) on the part of the writers.

Indeed, part of me wonders if this movie is just an attempt to say humans are worthless blights on the face of creation. A dad cannot show his son love, and then throws away the robot he made as a shallow substitution. A one dimensional politician is obsessed with starting wars so he can get re-elected. The cast out tinkerer is actually a robot sadist. The audience is despicable for laughing at robots' pain and even the writers are indecent for exploiting them. Even the one ""decent"" human (Doctor Elefun) is so passive and spineless that he does more to enable evil than stop it. The hero of our film is a robot, energized by some alien star-stuff that makes him un-acceptable to his own father.

I don't think it was an active decision of David Bowers (writer, director) to give this message. Rather, I think he just let his own personal self loathing seep into the film at every point- his first instinct when confronted with a human to be shame, avarice or naked capitulation.

So there you go. A movie with sub-standard acting, shallow and cliche characters, contrived plot, and a message as incoherent as it is self-loathing. How anyone could give this more than two stars is beyond me. I give it one because it didn't look horrible.",1271980800,6,3859,4.759342301943199

3761120,5,B001PR0Y7Q,"At the beginning of the animated film ""Astro Boy"" (2009) he's just a regular kid (the voice of Freddie Highmore)who has trouble getting much attention from his father (Nicholas Cage) who is the head of the scientific research department in a very modernistic city state. His department has invented two energy forces, a blue one and a red. The red is destructive, aggressive, and militaristic while the blue is peaceful, non-aggressive and a force for good in the world. The work in the country is done by robots who are essentially slaves.
 Disobeying his father's injunctives, the boy sneaks into the lab where the malignant President (Donald Sutherland) is trying to convince the father and chief scientist to release the red force and energize a giant robot with the force.
 The boy gets trapped in a chamber with the destructive robot armed with the red force and is annihilated. The father recreates the boy's DNA into a robot that looks like his son and is energized by the blue force. The father soon finds that the robot cannot be his true son, and he rejects him. That's when Astro Boy is born, a robot who looks like a boy but has superhuman powers.
 The president forces the father to release the energy in the red core and put it to use to further his political ends.
 The boy finds the robot dump, and there he meets a number of different characters. There is a Fagin-like character, almost out of ""Oliver Twist,"" named Hamegg who looks exactly like and talks like Nathan Lane, and who is, in fact, played by Lane. He has special powers and can repair robots, but he's an evil presence who has robots battle monster robots in a Coliseum-like setting. He becomes Astro Boy's enemy.
 There are plenty of action sequences, tenderness when Astro Boy meets a girl, and a lot to keep viewers busy. Our hero has to win back his father and make the dad think he's worthy of being loved. A worthwhile flick with good animation, interesting characters, and a strong story.",1271635200,3,1976,4.666666666666667
3761121,3,B001PR0Y7Q,"I'm 20 years old and I wasn't into Astro Boy until 3 years ago. I watched most of the 60s series, all of the 80s, and all of the 2003-2004 series. I just love the concept behind Astro Boy and his innocent character so I went to see this film in cinemas with much anticipation. What I found made me very disappointed.

1. The core plot stays true to the original series: Toby dies and his father Dr. Tenma builds a robot to replace his son. I was glad about that.

2. The plot was boring, predictable, and overused. There were a few moments that pulled at my sympathy like Astro's face when Dr. Tenma rejected him, or Dr. Tenma's struggle to grasp that it was his lack of parental stamina that caused his son to die.

3. The characters were stripped of originality. It seemed this movie tried to mature Astro above his ""age"" (or intended audience age). Dr. Tenma's roll was marginalized and he appeared at all those ""just at the right moment"" phases like making stage entrances when I was wondering, ""where did he come from?"" The end scene where Astro is revived is one of those. The president was pathetic and they made him out to be stupid. I guess that was supposed to be funny but it made the film harder to watch. Dr. Elephan (sp?) was also shoved to the back. Instead they brought in several new characters? I guess that was supposed to appeal to children too.

4. I'm tired of children's films being saturated with political undertones. This movie hardly attempted to hide the undertones and I felt that, regardless of my political stance, I wouldn't want my child watching this because of the undertones. This was the most disappointing part: to turn Astro Boy into an excuse to sell a point of view. How insulting. How belittling of the series.

The animation was well done for the most part, the action scenes were pretty good, and the special effects I thought were flashy and exciting. If you watch this movie mentally prepared for the defects, it's not so bad. I bought it purely because I'm an Astro Boy memorabelia collector.",1271203200,3,2039,4.514905149051491
3761122,1,B001PR0Y7Q,"I wish I would have read the spoilers and reviews before we watched this.  I rented it today for my 3-year-old son and we were taken by surprise by the scene of the boy dying and then the part where the father rejects Astro Boy.  I had to look at my 3-yr-old and tell him that his father and I would NEVER reject him and that we'll always love him...and that he's irreplaceable!  I think the father ""coldly,"" rejecting the son was WAY over the line.

Nicolas Cage (as well as his character) is ""blah...""  Even Toby (Astro Boy) is blah.  If your father tells you out of the blue that he doesn't love you or want you I think you'd be a bit more distressed!  If they are going to add some horrific situation, like they did, then the acting should have been in line with that.

The film doesn't form strong relationships.  They're all too short-lived and filled with gaps, so you never get to fall in love with the characters. The sad parts don't give the viewer enough time to connect with the emotion, so you end up not really caring that the boy died or later abandoned/rejected.

And it's not funny at all.  The script is lame.

3761125,3,B001PR0Y7Q,"While its been statistically proven that there is little love for Osamu Tezuka out here in the States, the God Of Manga is still big with old school otaku. Hell, if it weren't for him, we wouldn't even have anime out here in the way that we do. For a little quick history, Tezuka created this as a manga in the early 50s titled Tetsuwan Atom(""Mighty Atom""), and made into an anime series in early 60s, which was the first anime to be shown on American TV. It was later remade in the 1980, and then again in 2003, both of which have also been played out here on TV, although only with minimal success. The original was so popular because of how groundbreaking it was, and was the first real taste us gaijin got of anime. One of the most appealing things about it was Tezuka's take on the old Walt Disney style of character designs, as it pretty evident with Astro's two hair-horns homaging Mickey Mouse's ears. So anyway, trying to latch on to a bit of nostalgia like a ton of other movies have been doing lately(Alvin & The Chipmunks, G.I. Joe,  A-Team, Clash Of The Titans), the crew from the ill-fated Imagi Studios(TMNT)decided to give a shot at doing a feature film based on the American version.

Set in the very distant future, most of the Earth is covered with garbage(think Wall-E), but a century ago some scientists raised a city up from the rubish to live out their lives in a waste-free enviroment, and called it Metro City. They created robots with slightly advanced A.I.'s to do all their work, and toss all their garbage on to the ground below. One of the main minds behind this is Dr. Tenma, but his eagerness to impress the corrupt President with a new military robot causes his son Toby to be killed. Distraught, Tenma makes a robot duplicate of him, but fits him with incredible strength, rocket feet, and a huge arsenal all powered by special energy source from space called Blue Core. The robot Toby figures out he's not really human much to his suprise after listening to some maintenance-bots chatting, and then going on a scenic flight through the city. After being dejected by his creator/father who realizes he's not a perfect replacement for his original son, Toby leaves, but is hunted down by the President's forces to use the Blue Core in their Peacemaker droid. Toby gets shot down to the surface, where he befriends some children scrounging in the junk for robot parts. Although he was quickly accosted by the ""Robot Revolutionary Front"" and given the new name Astro, he goes off with Cora and the other kids to the tinkerer Hamegg who rebuilds robots and takes care of orphens. Astro tries to hide the fact that he's really a robot from the others, although Hamegg figures it out, and exposes him when they go to the Robot Games which is like a mecha gladiator fight. Hamegg corners Astro into battling a bunch of Mega Man-baddies, and almost has to fight Zog, a large construction bot that Astro brought back online, but refuses to fight Astro. The President locates Astro, and forces him back to Metro City. He has Tenma take the Blue Core out of Astro, but Tenma has a change of heart, and Astro flies away. In spite of this, the President uses the unstable Red Core(the ""evil"" version of the Blue Core)to activate the Peacemaker, which absorbs him into it, and now the President is in its body. The Peacemaker starts absorbing half the city, and fights Astro in a stupendous battle. This causes Metro City to fall to the ground, which Astro manages soften the landing of. He then runs head on into the Peacemaker, and his energy cancels it out. Althought depleted of power, Zog shows up to lend him some of his excess Blue Core energy to reactive him. Astro is then viewed as a hero by the people, although he gets to pull one real routine right out of the old show at the finale.

Imagi pulled off a very impressive production in this, managing to pull together some of the great action of The Incredibles with the family comedy of Robots. It's unfortunate that it wasn't met with more success at the box office, even to the point of Imagi having to close down their American studios. They were planning on doing film versions of Gigantor and Battle Of The Planets, but no yet word if their Asian branch will complete them. Perhaps it might have done better financially if it had been done exclusively for Japanese audiences first as an adaptation of the original anime instead of the American edition, so they could've gotten most of their production money back. The movie itself is well animated, maybe not totally on the level with most American studios like Dreamworks or Pixar, but definately above your average made-for-video/TV animation. It also features an all-star English cast like Nicolas Cage, Kristen Bell, Charlize Theron, and Samuel L. Jackson. However, the ones who really stood out where Nathan Lane, Bill Nighy, and Donald Sutherland. The DVD/Blu-Ray features two impressive original animated shorts too. Very much worth at least a solid rental for superhero fanatics, and unlike a certain other comic book movie, this one actually had a giant alien squid in it!",1270166400,4,5118,4.65929203539823

The lines were pretty bad, and the president had to repeat around 10 times he wanted to be reelected. How dumb do we have to be to keep having it drilled in our brains? The movie seems to be going well until Nicolas Cage voice appears. It definitely doesn't seem like he is trying hard, but he practically ruins the moment due to you thinking its just Nicolas Cage and not a caring father. I watched the film with my roommates and they had no idea what the movie was about, but did not feel anything when poor Tobi kicked the bucket, Or when his father abandoned him.  Both are very crucial parts that include Nicolas Cage's voice over to carry the emotional toll. Furthermore, Tobi's death is a little bit too ambiguous. The action scenes is what saves this movie. Some minor adjustments in the script could of made this a classic. Some bad voices and script make this an average movie.

He sets out on an epic journey that brings him face to face with an underworld army of robots and some of the strangest creatures ever to walk the Earth, and along the way learns to experience human feelings and emotions. ""Astro Boy"" is well produced and is very entertaining. There was plenty of comedy to keep the movie light and lots of action to keep things moving. There are many endearing characters in this movie and interesting villains also. All in all, well and cleverly done. I recommend this to anyone who wants some light-hearted entertainment.",1269043200,4,839,4.793103448275862

Astro Boy does a fairly good job of bringing Osamu Tezuka's iconic creation -- now almost 60 years old -- into the 21st Century and putting it in front of a new generation of fans. Die-hard fans will surely bristle at some of the changes, but certain liberties were taken for this American production, such as slightly altering Astro's face and modifying some of the names (Professor Ochanomizu becomes Elefun), but the look of the main characters are more or less faithful. The producers also gave Toby/Astro clothes because going topless nowadays in a film would just be weird for modern audiences.

Storywise, the plot is very average and well-trodden, but it's aimed at kids, who may not care much about originality. A predictably ego-maniacal politician, President Stone, seizes a new scientific discovery (meteor power core) to power a military robot called ""The Peacekeeper"" in order to bolster his popularity for an upcoming election. Things go wrong, as they inevitably do with the ill-conceived plans of villains, then Astro (Mighty Atom in the original Japanese) comes to save the day. In the middle is a stretch of plot about Toby becoming an outcast and leaving the floating metropolis Metro City to discover his destiny amidst the rubbish, castaways, and orphaned kids of the surface world.

The voice cast turns in a decent performance, with the exception of Donald Sutherland as Stone, who is leaden and monotone.

If you're willing to let yourself go and take in the gorgeous CGI and beautifully rendered artwork, you might enjoy this animation. Visually, the film looks amazing, and you should really see it in hi-def instead of DVD. Produced by a HK-based animation studio, the sets are lavishly-detailed and the film just looks stunning. Overall, not a bad film and certainly enjoyable by kids and adults alike.",1268870400,4,3040,6.616541353383458

3761135,5,B001PR0Y7Q,"Astroboy is an interesting movie.  I went and saw this movie a few days after it released in theatres.  I kinda remember the cartoon as a kid and this helped to relive those memories.  Astroboy is a robot that has superpowers and uses them to save people and the world.

Astroboy is a character that dates back to the 1950's when it was created by Osamu Tezuka.  Astro is really well known in Japan and there were several of the cartoon series came here to the United States.

The movie follows the story pretty well but at the same time adds a few new things here and there to not just be a copy and paste kind of story.

There are some spoilers ahead:.......

In the manga (or comic) and now Movie is a boy named Toby who dies in an accident and his father Dr. Tenma builds a robot to be just like Toby.  The scene may scare some children that are really young but personally they did it tastefully and there are no gory scenes or anything.  (For the parents you see a bright flash and his hat is lying on the ground).  Alot of parents were upset by this however many movies made by Disney and so forth have had characters die in their movies constantly but people still praise them.

I suppose since it is a young boy they feel that it should not occur but the producers of the film wanted to keep the orgin of Astro as close as possible.

The movie was pretty well done.  There's some drama in along with action and that was pretty good.  It helped lead into the action sequences instead of being non-stop action or drama. I liked this film since it was something everyone could enjoy.  I went with my mom, dad, and 7 year old niece.  She really enjoyed it and the whole family wants it on DVD and blu-ray.  I do not remember any bad language as well.
I feel that if people gave Astroboy a chance they will enjoy it.  We've watched many kids films like Kung Fu Panda, Monsters Vs Aliens, and so on recently and this was one we all could watch no problem.

The movie looks great but in this day and age it is hard to compete with kids films since many come along on a constant basis.  I really enjoy the Pixar films like the Incredibles, Toy Story, etc and I put Astroboy on par with them.  I feel that this movie was definitely better than some of the recent kid films.

I also would encourage people if they are interested to check out the cartoons.  They are actually pretty good.  I bought them since I barely remember them as a kid and I am glad I did.  The 80's set is really good.  It covers some serious topics while still having that cute appeal for kids.  They are on amazon and really inexpensive as well.

I'll attempt to break it down for people.

Pros:  1. Based on a popular character in Japan
2.  Something both adults and children can enjoy
3.  No bad language and little potty humor (if any)
4.  Pretty good voice actors as well.

Cons:  1.  Fans of the old cartoons may not like the new look

Hope everyone has a great day!",1264636800,39,2945,4.211469534050179
3761136,3,B001PR0Y7Q,"Although kids are likely only to remember the 90% good parts of the movie, do be aware there are two scenes that are likely to be frightening and question-provoking.  #1  The scientist's child dies in the first few moments - killed by the peackeeper robot.  #2  After creating the AstroBoy (to replace the dead child), the same scientist rejects Astroboy and says he doesn't want him around anymore and sends him away.",1264204800,12,418,4.763888888888889

What I really hated: not a boring moment !

FINALLY !!! After 57 years of waiting, Astro Boy FINALLY hit the big screen with a BANG !!! The movie not only amused astro boy die-hard fans, it's for everyone ! It not only explore the humanity among us, how simple things can be left neglected & be regreted later, how a young astro boy can go all the way out to help the needy without a thought of being selfish. This movie emcompasses everything....fun-filled actions, touching storyline, good humours & last but not least, marvellous soundtrack from John Ottman. A MOVIE REALLY WORTH WAITING FOR !!! As what Astro Boy quoted ""This is it. This is what I was created for. This is my destiny. "" A destiny to care for the others, the needy !

3761138,4,B001PR0Y7Q,"One of the most famous manga/anime characters in Japan, Astro Boy is now made into a computer animated film. Though the film was not a commercial success (in US and Japan alike), the new ""Astro Boy"" film is not as bad as the rather disappointing box office performance suggests. Perhaps the fans of the original TV series would disagree (not without good reason), but the animation is fairly entertaining with some nice action sequences.

The story is set in the futuristic city, a metropolis floating in the sky called ""Metro City."" There, to replace his lost son Toby, a genius scientist Dr. Tenma (voice by Nicholas Cage) creates a specially designed humanoid robot (voiced by Freddie Highmore). The robot not only looks the same externally as the beloved Toby; it is the pinnacle of the most advanced technologies as the new ""Toby"" or ""Astro Boy"" can speak, think, and even feel like Toby. However, the doctor soon realizes that something is not quite right. After all, he is not his son.

To make matters worse, President Stone (voice by Donald Sutherland) attempts to use Astro Boy's energy sources for military purposes so that he would be re-elected next term. Chased by the military police, Astro Boy falls overboard from the City and finds himself on the Earth's surface, where he befriends a jolly guy named Hamegg (voice by Nathan Lane) and a group of his ""children,"" including the leader, Artful Dodger-like girl Cora (voice by Kristen Bell).

The film's storyline, loosely based on Tezuka's original manga/anime, is not very compelling and some part of the plot is clearly borrowed from two famous novels (by Carlo Collodi and Charles Dickens). Though the robot hero is likable, some characters are insufficiently fleshed out. Fortunately the computer graphics are surprisingly good, and the action set-pieces are engaging and well-done, so please be patient a while and wait for them to start.

The film is produced by the Hong-Kong based company Imagi International Holdings Limited (responsible for ""TMNT"" (""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles""). The director is David Bowers, known for ""Flushed Away"" co-directed by Sam Fell. Other voice actors include Charlize Theron, Samuel L. Jackson, Bill Nighy, Eugene Levy and Matt Lucas, but their roles are mostly small.

You may not know his name, but Osamu Tezuka (1928-89), creator of Astro Boy or ""Tetsuwan Atomu"" (meaning Mighty Atom), is probably the most influential manga artist in Japan. The robot Astro Boy first appeared in his comic in 1951, and since then made into TV animation three times (1963-66) (1980-81) (2003-04). Some of you who have seen these animations on TV like me will find that the design of Astro Boy is ""modernized.""

The 2009 ""Astro Boy"" is not a masterpiece and its animation is just acceptable, not outstanding. Still the film is pretty enjoyable.",1262304000,4,2834,5.031982942430703
3761139,5,B001PR0Y7Q,"When the movie was first released in theaters, I didn't bother to go to it until I realized there were only a couple of showings left and it would probably be gone in a week or two.  Sure enough, 10 days later it was gone, but in that time I ended up seeing it 4 times.

I loved this movie!  It has the same animation quality as The Incredibles, and while I love anime, I never watched the Astro Boy cartoon, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the story.  It's simply the journey of a super boy trying to find his place in the world.  Not really original, like one other review said, but as children's movie or an anime fan, it was perfect.  Astro Boy was just an endearing character for me.

I liked the English voice acting a lot, nothing wrong with the dialogue.  There were a couple of minor parts that didn't quite make sense to me afterward, but they were small things that didn't affect the plot at all.  I also wished they explained some things about the other characters at the end of the movie, but again, they were minor enough that it didn't ruin it for me.

I definitely look forward to getting this on blu-ray, glad they finally set a date for it.",1261872000,6,1164,4.226244343891403
