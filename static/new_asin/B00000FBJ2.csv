I loved the minimalist, claustrophobic feel to the movie- the sustained suspense and dread. Too bad Mr. Bava didn't do more non-period-piece movies.",1501027200,,259,5.5
7907502,5,B00000FBJ2,"I often say that La maschera del demonio (Black Sunday) is my favorite film. If I make an inventory of what I remember that I have seen in 66 years, it would probably be ousted by something else, but it was definitely the movie that made the first big impact on my mind. So excuse me, but I will first make a brief summary about its director. Mario Bava was extremely skilled at narrative, visual and budget economy. A master of cinematography, he saved more than one film by directing additional scenes of unfinished projects under the orders of Riccardo Freda, Raoul Walsh, Sergio Leone, Jacques Tourneur and others, for which --as a ""prize""-- he was given the opportunity to direct the first film of his own. The result was the classic Italian horror film La maschera del demonio in 1960. Thirteen years later, after directing more classics (The Three Faces of Fear, The Whip and the Body, Diabolik) and cult movies (Hercules at the Center of the Earth, The Girl Who Knew Too Much, Terror in Space) and contributing to the emergence of the ""giallo"" genre (6 Women for the Murderer, The Red Sign of Madness, 5 Dolls for an August Moon) that influenced the careers of his son Lamberto, Dario Argento and Quentin Tarantino, Bava went into decline and in 1973 set out to win again his place with this motion picture in which he would demonstrate that he was able to adjust to the times and make an effective police film, following the scheme of a road movie, according to the story ""Man and Boy"" by Michael J. Carroll. Unfortunately Bava faced great obstacles. The budget was so low that he also had to assume the cinematography, its producer went bankrupt and the courts seized the footage. When Bava died in 1980, the film was still incomplete and was not released until March 1996, at the Brussels Festival of Fantasy Films, thanks to the effort made by actress Lea Lander, Lamberto Bava and producer Alfredo Leone. I did not expect much, but believe me, what a good movie this is! As it has been written, it is a true journey to hell: a tense, cruel, violent, disturbing, repellent, virulent story of a brutal robbery in which the savage assailants take for hostages a man with a car, his sick son who needs urgent medical attention and a woman who went shopping. The number of dead and the humiliation of the hostages increase as the films advances guided by the firm hand of Bava, who introduces humor in the midst of the terror, until he leads us to a surprise ending. There are at least six versions of the film, but certainly the best is the one close to the original screenplay, also known as Semaforo rosso. Mind you, do not let anyone ruin the end. This is without question one of Mario Bava best films. 4.5",1492905600,,2718,4.560327198364008
7907503,4,B00000FBJ2,"Many have seen this film as finished by Bava's son, re-titled 'Kidnapped'. But almost all Bava fans and professional critics prefer the rougher edged, less polished original; 'Rabid Dogs'.

--vague possible mild spoilers ahead --

It's a film that is saved by the rare truly successful twist ending, that changes everything you thought you saw. The acting is less than great, and the film has a definite misogynistic tone (although everyone in it is pretty awful on the humanity scale).

On the other hand, there's effectively high tension, as 3 murderous robbers take two innocent people and a baby hostage. Especially impressive that it never feels talky or visually dull, despite taking place almost entirely inside a car.

The over-acting and clunky dubbing (and writing) hurt.  But then the end came and I was suddenly ready to forgive a lot.",1449273600,,847,5.021428571428571

7907505,3,B00000FBJ2,"Being a huge Bava fan, I was eagerly awaiting this departure from horror and fantasy. It was the master's attempt at making a film about the real world and the people in it. After viewing, I think Bava nearly succeeded. Probably the best acting I've seen in a Bava film, this could be due to the fact that it wasn't dubbed. Also, the film shocked me with some incredibly brutal scenes, especially when one kidnapper forces a woman to urinate in front of him, and she DOES!!!. The twist ending was incredible and unexpected. The only real problem I had with the film are all of the little cliches that make me so irritated. For example, the kidnappers are about to fill up the gas tank to their captured car. They're about to get away and then, out of nowhere, a hitch hiker appears desperately needing a ride. And they give her one!!!

 All in all, if you can handle the annoyances, and the ultra-small subtitles, I think you'll enjoy this ""lost"" treasure.",1155859200,5,956,4.520231213872832
