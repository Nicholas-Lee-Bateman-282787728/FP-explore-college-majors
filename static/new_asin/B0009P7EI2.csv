2308103,5,B0009P7EI2,"I saw this movie during my highschool course in 2000. I had no iead what the story was about, nor did I realize that I would be quickly falling in love with this movie. Im not going to say much because it will destroy the ""out come"" behind both movies.

This is seriously a movie for the ages-- ""warning- young children should probably not wtch the first 15 min of the second part"".

I encourage everyone to place this hard to find movie in ther collection- Im sure it will be selling in the 100's once again it is locked in the MGM volt.",1183766400,6,538,4.163461538461538
2308104,5,B0009P7EI2,"These two movies combined are the most beautiful I have ever seen in every respect.  Gerard Depardieu has long since established himself in many genres, but as the poor guy who takes all the hard knocks and keeps on getting back up again, he's as good as they get. Emanuelle Beart is absolutely gorgeous as (adult) Manon, the scenery of the Luberon is amazing, and when I was offered a chance to visit that area by friends in France I jumped at it purely based on the wonderful memories of this movie experience. I had been hoping to get a copy on dvd for as long as dvds have been an option and have had the book for many years now. I am a true fan of this very special story which surely could not be depicted any more beautifully than it is here.",1178582400,15,749,4.201388888888889
2308105,5,B0009P7EI2,"Jean de Florette

This film is in two parts (the second called Manon des Sources) but it is best seen as one film running over 230m. It tells of the tragedy overtaking two families over three generations in Provence during and after the first world war, all because of a lost love letter. Because he thinks he's lost the love of his life Cesar pins all his hopes on his only relative, and feels hatred for Florette's son by another man. He ruins him, only to find too late he's made a terrible mistake. It's a story of love turning to bitterness and spite, which leads in the end to self destruction.

Both films benefit from three of the greatest performances in French cinema, from Daniel Auteuil, Gerard Depardieu and Yves Montand.

The first film, Jean de Florette,  suffers however from some major defects. The plot lurches on from unlikely coincidence to unlikely coincidence (we are asked to believe that the conspirators accidentally kill not one but two owners of the land they covert). At the end we see Manon just happening to come upon them as they just happen to unblock the spring, and understanding all - in the second film, Manon des Sources, Manon seems to have forgotten this, as she is upset when she just happens to overhear two poachers expounding the plot to one another about midway through that film. And pacing flags in the first film as we see Jean exhausting himself trying to deal with the drought, with lots of close ups of his suffering face while dramatic music swells from the soundtrack. We wonder why he's the only one affected by this drought, as all the other farmers seem to spend their time gambling and drinking in the pub. Some of these idlers do mention they might lose crops, but apparently aren't prepared to do anything much about it.

Regarded as a separate film, Jean de Florette can plausibly be accused of exploitative melodrama to an excessive degree (and very effectively done too). Seen as part of a longer film however the slowness and even the excesses add to the cumulative force of the denouement, as the story of what happened all those years ago is gradually revealed. The direction in the second part of the film (Manon des Sources) is much surer, as Berri, freed from the need to establish character, brings the tragedy to a devastating climax. Even if you cavil at the likelihood of a French peasant girl in the 20s or 30s dancing naked in the fields (her mother has abandoned her to go off and be an opera singer) or object to the clumsiness of a comedic treatment of an expert sent to advise on the drought who baffles the villages by spouting geological technicalities, there is no denying the skill with which Provincial farming life is depicted. Anybody who sees the film will understand how its people fall in love with this landscape, and will very likely do so themselves.  It is perhaps important to reflect that this is a tragedy, with implications for all walks of life, and not just a story of meanness and double dealing among French farmers.",1176595200,14,3015,4.6367041198501875

Immediately in the theater, during the previews, I felt assaulted by the audio, blaring in Dolby version X.X., the senses overwhelmed and over stimulated.  The content of the movies seemed to follow suit, decked out with special effects, the bigger and more fiery the explosion, the more bone rattling the surround sound, the better, apparently.

This movie - and most other good foreign movies - is different.  Here we have a masterpiece of the human soul.  This movie is dramatic in the beauty of the landscape, and explosive for the emotional power in the workings of fate.  It is seemingly quiet but its impact is powerful.

2308192,5,B0009P7EI2,"Jean de Florette and Manon of the Spring are more closely related than an original and sequel; they are really parts 1 and 2 of the same film, and in fact were filmed back to back.

Set in Provence around 1920 (most people still use horses, donkeys and mules, but there are a few autos around; telephones exist but are rare, the mayor is very proud to have one), the first film tells of Jean de Florette (Gerard Depardieu,) a rather intellectual bourgeois civil servant from the city who, having inherited a farm in Provence, moves his wife Aimee ( lisabeth Depardieu, Gerard Depardieu s real life wife at the time) and ten year old daughter Manon there, with the intention of applying scientific principles to raise vegetables and rabbits.  But in the arid climate of Provence, everything depends on water: there is a plentiful spring on the property but Jean doesn't know it because his neighbors, local worthy Cesar ""Le Papet"" (""Gramps"") Soubeyran (Yves Montand) and his rather dim nephew Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil)  have blocked it up, hoping that the lack of water will cause the farm to fail, so they can buy it cheap.  This tactic has tragic consequences for Jean's family.  The second film recounts how ten years later Manon, now a beautiful young woman, finds both the spring and a way of revenge for what was done to her family.  In the end, everyone gets more or less their just desserts.

The films have an interesting history.  French writer and director Marcel Pagnol, whose play Marius was latter turned into the French film trilogy Marius/Csar/Fanny, which was itself remade into the 1962 Hollywood film Fanny with Leslie Caron and other big stars, made a film in 1953, Manon des Sources, telling the second part of the story; his final cut of over four hours was so drastically cut by the distributor that Pagnol disowned it, and later redid the same story as a novel, adding a prequel novel,  Jean de Florette; these two books together became the basis for these films.

Jean de Florette and Manon of the Spring were a huge success both commercially and critically, and its easy to see why.  The Provencal settings are meticulously detailed and the landscape photography luscious. The acting is all around excellent: Gerard Depardieu and Yves Montand especially are as good as theyve ever been.

These films are not perfect works of art:  they are not free of sentimentality, some viewers may occasionally be confused about exactly who some of the minor characters are, and the surprise ending ties together all the loose ends so neatly that it may see rather artificial.  But these are minor flaws. All in all, this is a production that I think everyone will like: its one of those rare films that leave you with memories that seem to be of people and places youve experienced rather than seen on a screen.

Both films are available from MGM as a set of excellent quality on standard and Blu-Ray DVD.",1465603200,,2916,4.735177865612648

This is a film about character and irony and theme, not action-packed adventure.

2308289,5,B0009P7EI2,"This two part film, Jean de Florette and Manon of the Spring, is such a richly textured character study that I found myself wishing it would never end.  Its odd when you watch a lengthy film and feel as though time is passing so swiftly that its over before you know it and you are left wanting more, but not in a bad way.  It is not as if the story had more to say, or was lacking, even though I would love to have the story continue on.  Its just that, at nearly five hours collectively, this is such an engrossing watch that it could have lasted all day and I would have been happy.

This reminds me of the experience I had while watching Mysteries of Lisbon.

Jean de Florette starts the story, introducing us to Cesar and Ugolin, the last of the Soubeyran family living in France.  Cesar is an aged bachelor with a large bank account and no one to leave it to but his dimwitted nephew, Ugolin.  Ugolin is in his thirties and lacking any motivation to seek a wife, but he does have big dreams to start a carnation farm.  The problem is, he needs more land.  Through a series of distasteful actions, Cesar and Ugolin attempt to attain this land, which means actively working to rid the land of its new owners, a hunchback from Crespin named Jean.

As the first part of this story ends, Ugolin is in possession of the land and Jeans family is sent back to Crespin a shell of what they were before.  Then begins Manon of the Spring, which takes place ten years later when Jeans daughter, Manon, returns to exact revenge against the men that cheated her father.

I don't want to explain too much, because there is so much to be gained from going in blind.

This is a truly remarkable technical achievement, as well as a narrative one.  The cinematography and score are particularly marvelous.  The acting is also top notch, with Daniel Auteuil (who won a Cesar and a BAFTA for his performance) and Yves Montand building such beautifully well-rounded characters.

It still is one of the best of artistic works that manages to not only encapsulate the human condition but is also such an aesthetically pleasing film to just look at.
One difference in my attitude is that while I still find the Soubeyrans' actions deplorable, much of the character Jean's problem is that he tries to have it both ways: he looks to science to help him figure out the best ways to manage his farm yet he looks to his God so he can still indulge his excesses and naive hopes.",1379376000,,716,4.350746268656716

In part 1 ,a  family moves to a remote farm from the city to try a different life, but soon find out that farming is very hard with little water and a drought. This part ends sadly when the young girl's father loses his life trying to find a spring with explosives . She later finds some neighbors, who knew the spring's location, digging it up after her father's death. In part 2, It's hard to believe a spring, which is the only source of water for the village, could make a big impact, when it's stopped by a beautiful blond French woman, getting revenge against her neighbors , who had kept the secret. . The drama begins when a man stalks this beautiful woman, trying to get the courage to ask her for marriage. But the woman remembers him from part 1 of the series, and how he and his uncle , who knew the location of the spring, dug it up. There's no love at all, and she hates this man for that very reason.

2308344,5,B0009P7EI2,"""Jean de Florette"" is a rich, complex story you can really get your teeth into, but I caution you from the get-go: Have ""Manon of the Spring"" sitting beside your video player! Watching the first story but having to wait to see the conclusion of this saga is cruel and unnecessary.

The cast is flawless: Gerard Depardeau (""Les Comperes"" and ""Les Miserables""); Yves Montand (""Is Paris Burning?"" and ""On a Clear Day""); Daniel Auteuil (""The Closet"" and ""Cache""); along with an armload of other French actors and actresses playing authentically provincial characters. Both movies are shot in a single area in an interesting, rocky, semi-arid part of France, although the dialogue is sometimes in French and sometimes in Italian, so it clearly is supposed to be near the border. The story begins immediately after WWI and the second part (""Manon"") takes place ten years later.

Gerard Depardeau is an ebullient hunchback, happily moving his cherished little family, a former opera-singer wife and their pre-teen daughter, Manon, into the area. He inherited the farm from a relative and is eager to leave his tax-collector job in the city and pursue an ""authentic"" life in the pure country air. He has many textbook-based theories on farming and animal husbandry, most of which his closest neighbors, Montand and Auteuil find amusing. Montand is a wealthy bachelor farmer from a family which has been prominent in the area for decades. Auteuil is his homely dim-witted nephew who only wants to grow carnations.

Montand's clever character very much wants to buy the adjacent land but does NOT want to pay very much for it. He sees his plots to run off the increasingly desperate little family as a kindness, ""They would be so much happier in the city and a hunchback makes a better tax collector than a farmer!"" He and his nephew, as a preemptive strike, had stopped up and concealed a spring that was conveniently close to the farmhouse, even before our family has a chance to move in. In addition, they create a bias against the newcomers in the nearby village. A summer drought forces the three to carry water on foot and by mule, as they know nothing of the spring, and an empty cistern threatens to derail Depardeau's optimistic plans.

Both films taken together create the complete story. Montand does most of the heavy lifting, particularly near the end of the second film...and he is WONDERFUL!...although Auteuil is convincingly daft and Depardeau shows a sunny disposition I don't think I've ever seen him display before. Both films were shot in 1986 and have been treasured for decades. Amazon sells both of them as a set...sorta like having your own mini-series.",1364256000,,2668,4.9222222222222225

Having seen these movies when they came out in theaters in the 1980s, these were the first VHS tapes I ever purchased. Back then, videotapes were very expensive, but they were worth it. I had searched for a good dvd copy a couple times, but those available were purportedly knock-offs or pirated copies, and the recommendation was to stay away. I finally saw this on Amazon, with good quality reviews, and I took a chance. I watched them both as soon as they arrived. They did not disappoint.

Great story and great acting by Yves Montand and Daniel Auteil. Gerard Depardieu is also outstanding.  Emmanuelle Beart is perfect in her role as a quiet traumatized child who saw her father throughout her childhood suffer and being ridiculed.

If you plan to watch these two movies, please make sure you watch them in French and wait all the way to the end of the second movie to understand what is really going on. You will be in tears. The punishment of Yves Montand for his nastiness and poor behavior in his life is huge and severe. This is French literature at its best. You may not appreciate ""l'accent du sud"" that Yves Montand has throughout the movie but when they speak is like a song for French speaking people. Really!

For French teachers, please show these movies to your students. Make sure they put their iPod with their junk music away first. That used to be the real France ""a la campagne"". That is the real life and the REAL people according to Marcel Pagnol. Unfortunately, this type of culture is close to disappearing in France.

Take four hours of your life and immerse yourself into the treat offered to you by Marcel Pagnol and Yves Montand. You can watch these movies again, and again, and again...You will not regret.",1343001600,4,1417,4.48062015503876

2308403,5,B0009P7EI2,"Jean de Florette,"" (1986), and its sequel (although, really, it's simply a continuation of the story), MANON OF THE SPRING, constitute a singular French drama, a mouth-watering, award-winning color film.  It is set apparently, in the early 20th century, in Provence, in the gorgeous, fertile south of France, and tells a bittersweet tale of life among the peasantry of the time. It is based on a novel, with which I am not familiar, by the noted French author Marcel Pagnol, with whose work, I regret, I am also not familiar, although I believe the author was also a screenwriter of note. It was adapted for the screen and directed by Claude Berri. The original score was written, and performed by Jean-Claude Petit and his orchestra; there are musical snatches throughout of the opera La forza del destino by Guiseppi Verdi.

Central to the tale are the schemings of Cesar Soubeyran, known as ""Le Papet"" locally, wealthy, almost last survivor of a dynasty of hard-working, successful peasants, and treated with great respect in the village. As played by the magnetic, older Yves Montand, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wages-of-Fear-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780021932/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wages of Fear (The Criterion Collection)</a>), he is as hard a man as his long life has made him. Then, his possibly not all there nephew Ugolin, played by Daniel Auteil, always so successful at playing not particularly bright characters (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Closet/dp/B00005OSLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Closet</a>&nbsp;[DVD] [2001]) comes home from his stint in the army. The older man is anxious to see his nephew married, with children, settled locally, and making a living before his illnesses end his life. Accordingly, Cesar has his eye on a plot of land that adjoins his holdings, and several healthy looking girls in the village.

But the land the Soubeyran family covets is sold to an outsider, a tax collector civil servant, a luckless hunchback played by the magnificent Gerard Depardieu, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Card/dp/B00008977F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Card</a>&nbsp;[1991])who comes bearing some regulation outsiders' French name, and a family to support. However, if Jean had been called by the name he should have been in the village, had they known who he really was, he would have been known locally as Jean de Florette, the title character. At any rate, the Soubeyrons, Cesar and Ugolin, pretend to befriend and help the naive and generous hunchback, who is inexperienced in farming, but has many ambitious plans, some of which are entirely unsuited for the location. Nevertheless,the Soubeyrons secretly work against the would-be farmer, most importantly by depriving him of water.

Greedy, cruel behavior to be sure, with tragic consequences.  MANON picks up the story of the Soubeyran family, as a tale of revenge.  . We begin ""Manon"" with a glimpse of the title character, the daughter of Jean de Florette., in the person of the beautiful Emmanuelle Beart(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nathalie/dp/B000ENC73G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nathalie</a>[2003]). After the death of her father, which she believes was caused by the Soubeyrans, she has grown up largely on her own, as her mother has had to seek work elsewhere. Manon is rather an uneducated wild child as a result: she has kept herself alive by being a shepherdess, in addition hunting small birds for sale. She decides to take revenge against the village that allowed the Soubeyrans to behave as they did, and deprives the village of its water, causing great chaos and consternation. Ugolin is deeply in love with her, but she, of course, will have nothing to do with him: she rather fancies the handsome young local schoolteacher, who is, however, miles above her in the village's social order.

The film(s) are moving, powered by the work of their stars, as these characters work out their destinies, and reach a somewhat surprising conclusion: not the one for which Cesar had hoped, but one he can appreciate. Their visual leitmotif, the red carnations, will stick in your mind long afterwards.  JEAN was nominated for a Golden Globe, and won several other awards. The films may be thought to have dated a bit, to be a bit too reliant on coincidence. Still, they seem to me grounded in reality. We watch the first telephones and automobiles creep into town, the appearance of new styles of dress. And I believe that French peasants, any peasants really, have historically wanted only certain things: land, with water on it; real gold, not paper scrip, and the success and survival of their families.

The films have such a stellar French cast: Yves Montand, Gerard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil and Emmanuelle Beart.

The first film is the story of Jean Cadoret (Gerard Depardieu) who inherits a farm in Provence from his mother. He is, however, unaware that his neighbor, Cesar Doubeyran (Yves Montand) covets his farm for his godson (Daniel Auteuil) and plots to steal it from him no matter the cost.

Manon of the Spring picks up the story 10 years later with Jean Cadoret's daughter (Emmanuelle Beart) realizing that Cesar was directly responsible for her father's death and then plots her revenge.

But the rural town doesn't take well to outsiders and when he runs into trouble. And when he runs they don't help, even though they could have. Manon of the spring is the story of Monon, the daughter of Jean who is now grows up into beautiful women.

2308424,5,B0009P7EI2,"Claude Berri's two seminal films of Marcel Pagnol's literary classic need to be seen as one single piece of work. In sheer breadth of thematic scope and in their exploration of the unintended long-term consequences of human actions through generations, these fine works are right up there in the top ten best films of all time, in any language. Unfolding like a Shakespearean tragedy, the story reveals how a lost letter combined with deceitful, selfish actions from ultimately non-malign motives eventually bring catastrophe on an extended family and a whole community. When the audience learns a vital piece of information missing from the history at the same time as one of the principal characters (played by the excellent Yves Montand in his final cinematic role) some part-redemption is earned when the scale of the personal tragedy is fully realised in the final reel, but it's still epic tragedy and poignant beyond almost anything else in world cinema. ""As ye sow, so shall ye reap"" is the message, but it's far from simplistic moralising: these characters are deep, complex with many shades of grey, and in no way ""good guy/bad guy"" caricatures. They are real people, like you and me, and their tragic story is that of the human condition.

 ""Jean"" and ""Manon"" form one continuous story with a 10-year time gap. You absolutely must see them both, and in the correct order. On no account should you see ""Manon"" before seeing ""Jean"" first. Ideally, the films should be paced over two nights, but at the end of ""Jean"" you might be unable to contain your burning curiosity about what happens in the sequel, ""Manon"", so may choose to see both films back-to-back in a single four-hour sitting. The films are best watched in the original French so as to keep the subtleties and nuances of the original dialogue; the script is not over-wordy and the English subtitling is (with a few minor niggles) mostly accurate to the original.

The cinematography and the Provencal locations: breathtaking. The storyline: absorbing, deep, slow-paced, gripping. Acting: absolutely first-class from Gerard Depardieu, Yves Montand, Daniel Auteuil (an oscar-worthy performance playing brilliantly out of character), Emanuelle Beart (though playing a solitary and barely literate shepherdess she has few lines, the sheer power of her presence dominates ""Manon"") and the rest of the cast. Script: word-perfect, nothing superfluous. Soundtrack: languid, appropriate, mood-setting perfection. Direction: career-defining; an object lesson to young directors of how to reveal a story through novelistic character development in the cinematic medium.

These films teach us something about ourselves: to what consequences our actions may lead, how we may not know what we think we know, and what a difference it might make if we did; people are complex, a mix of good and not-so-good; nothing is black-and-white, and sometimes only in the long-term can the truth be seen.

Caution: there are no explosions, car chases, cartoon violence or sex scenes (though there is one scene in ""Manon"" of the stunningly beautiful Emanuelle Beart cavorting outside in the buff, which is absolutely essential to the story); no profane language. But watching these films will be one of the greatest cinematic experiences of your life, so savour the occasion and view it as special, because it will be.",1284422400,31,3362,5.184162062615101

In MOTS,Daniel Auteuil plays a feculent dolt who becomes obsessed with the Emmanuelle Bart character, who rejects him soundly.
In UCEH, the tables are turned as the soul of the Auteuil character has incarnated into a new life as a finely tuned, though emotionally reserved, artist and craftsman.

Very well written, very well played and very well set; it has many profound life lessons in it.  Very emotionally provoking, you see how the love of money is the root of all evil.  You see the truth of how when one digs a pit for another, he falls in it himself.  You see the sovereignty of God in the affairs of men.  Also, you see that life is truly not always fair.  One gets to see how small minded people can be, and how closed and hard one can become because of darkness of thought and selfishness of heart.

Others have pointed out shortcomings that I agree with, but overall I am very happy with this version. I will scrap both Korean versions, and not regret my added expense.",1256601600,2,523,4.954545454545454

In fact, when ""Jean De Florette"" ended, I was so ""into"" the story line that I insisted on watching ""Manon"" immediately after.  The ending was, for me, a total surprise, which just added to the pleasure I received from watching it.

These are WONDERFUL films.  I've been wanting to add them to my DVD collection, and found these on Amazon at a great price for the pair.

I was so bummed when I watched them because the sub-titling was HORRIBLE!!  I believe they must have used a failing first-semester high school French student to write the sub-titles.  Only 30% of the dialog was written, and not well.  Person 'A' askes Person 'B' a question.. only you would only see the first 3 words of the question... then tons of dialog on the screen, then Person 'B' would answer the question, and if you were lucky, they would answer in such a way that you may be able to figure out what the question must have been.

I'm convinced that if it was not for the fact that I was very familiar with both stories, I would have been completely lost... someone who was not familiar with them, would have absolutely no clue what was going on.

If you are familiar with the stories, by all means, purchase the DVD's.. the price is great and you'll be able to watch and enjoy.  If you have never seen these films before...

We waited with anticipation for Manon of the Spring.  We liked both so much that we brought copies.  The DVD set is very nice.  The color and clarity are excellent.

The story is a wonderful morality play and shows quite well how small town country folks often react when people apparently come from outside the community.  The films are visually stunning and well acted.  The characters seem so real that you quickly become absorbed.  If you like French movies, these are a must see!

We noticed for the first time an apparent falling tombstone blooper on the far right of the screen in the second film when Manon visits the cemetery in the rain.  We never noticed that before, so this version must show more of the image width than we saw before.",1231632000,2,900,4.5

Other reviewers have had conflicting comments about the translation; my French friends have told me that I can't use this film to improve my use of the French language because it's not the French of current, common usage.",1228867200,6,450,4.6125

If you don't speak French the subtitles are pretty much 100% accurate.

Each story can stand on its own -- I actually saw Manon of the Spring first -- but they belong together and Jean de Florette sets up the backstory of Manon.  You have to wait for the conclusion of Manon, however, to understand fully the story of Jean de Florette.

The performances are stunning, the stories are powerful, and I challenge anyone to be unmoved by the end of either film.  I saw these two during my freshman year in college and was amazed and stunned, and after seeing them I couldn't get enough of foreign cinema, catching every new release at our local arthouse theater.

2308501,5,B0009P7EI2,"Movie is set in a small rurul village in southeast France in the 1920's.  Water is scarce and the earth is parched.  Cesar and Ugolin scheme to acquire neighboring land that has access to precious spring water in order to feed a new carnation growing business.  An outsider, Jean, a city dweller, a former tax collector and a Hunchback, inherits the farm.  Jean settles in the property and begins farming the land and raising rabbits with his wife, and daughter Manon.  They struggle to battle the drought and also unbeknownst to them, are working against Cesar and Ugolin.

Beautiful cinematography showing the French countryside landscape.  Terrific acting by Gerard Depardieu (Jean the Hunchback), Yves Montand (playing Cesar) and Daniel Auteuil (playing Ugolin).  Depardieu is particularly good in his role as Hunchback who is an eternal optimist, dreamer and a genuinely good person.  Movie can be slow in parts but the story is engaging and holds your interest right until the end.  You live and feel the anguish of the major characters in the movie.

2308515,5,B0009P7EI2,"I had been impressed that I was getting 2 films on the same DVD for the price of one.  It wasn't until I watched them both that I realized how essential each one was to the other.  ""Jean De Florette"" very ably sets the table while ""Manon of the Spring"" delivers the feast.  Together they comprise 4 hours of film excellence (which is probably why they are listed as seperate movies).

The plot is the age-old story of greed.  In this case a childless man welcomes home his nephew from his military service.  They both have plans in this rural mountainous part of France (near the Pyrennes?).  What they need to make their plans come through is the next farm over with its' adequate spring water.  It turns out to be necessary to ""arrange"" for the farm to become available but an heir to the farm turns up to gladly become a transplanted farmer with all the books to show him how to do it.  The uncle and nephew conspire to make ""arrangements"" with the new owner in order to make the farm available to them (they plugged the spring so the farm wouldn't seem worth so much).  Something major happens that brings the first film to an end.  We pick it up 10 years (or so) later and, it seemed to me, the best of the two movies had come and gone.  However, the second movie slowly and deliberately comes to an elaborate series of events and information that left me in a sort of awesome sadness and appreciation.  A personal note about the final 15 or so minutes of the movie.  I discovered that my Tivo could not play a DVD and record off the TV at the same time.  All of a sudden, I lost the movie I was watching and started watching the lesser movie that I had set up to reco (I'm always challenged when my TV does things I didn't think it should do).  I mention this because just before that happened, ""The End"" appeared on ""Manon of the Spring"".  I assumed all I was missing was the cast and credits so I went to bed.  The next morning I played out the end only to discover there was more to the movie; much more.  The movie I thought had ended rather simplisticly evolved into a dramaticly powerful crescendo of emotion.  It changed my whole impression of the two-movie experience.

The two movies together make as powerful a statement as I have viewed on film of the concept that we are our brother's keepers; that every man or woman whom we meet as a stranger ought to depart as a friend.  The universal responsibility to do unto others as we would have them do unto us is brilliantly told in this movie duet.  Oddly, I don't even thing the main character leaves the movie with this knowledge.  He probably only realized that he erred only in failing to reach out to one person and his family.  However, I think the audience comes away with the big picture.  I know I did.",1205798400,2,2775,4.319148936170213
2308516,5,B0009P7EI2,"These magnificent films, two distinct parts forming a single epic story arc, represent French director Claude Berri's crowning achievement. The story takes place in the French countryside, with Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil starring as a well-to-do landowner and his nephew, whose greed and avarice cause toil and trouble for an altruistic hunchback (Gerard Depardieu) and his family, big-city transplants who inherit a neighboring farm. A tragic, lyrical fable with one of the most emotionally shattering final acts that you will likely ever experience at the movies.  Adapted from the novels by Marcel Pagnol.

Those who saw these movies previously *want* them for their collections for a reason; the acting is top-rate, the story is a classic, and the presentation (i.e. cinematography) is skilled and artistic (which is a rare combination). I suppose that the lack of ""remastering"" of the actual picture is due to the ""bargain"" nature of the release. Still, it's a small flaw in an otherwise excellent pair of films... and I didn't have *either* of them in *any* quality, VHS or otherwise, before this release.

The major drawback, as others have said, is the packaging--specifically the lack of any accompanying material, even a simple two-page (i.e. one fold) insert with a scene selection listing and brief discussion of the importance of the films for French (and world) cinema would have been appreciated. I don't know what the obstacles to a Criterion Collection release would be, but that would be what I would demand if I were going to purchase these movies on DVD again. Perhaps that will be done in the next format (Blue-ray or HD-DVD), though if it were to come out on current DVD in such an edition I'd be likely to get it.

Like the Marcel Pagnol novel upon which they are based, these two films are greatly enhanced when treated as a proper storytelling whole.

That storytelling is masterful from start to finish, and the acting -- including that of every minor character -- superb. The same goes for the settings, cinematography, and music. Wonderful in every way.

These are among the greatest adaptations of book-based storytelling to the screen. After the magnificent lead performance by the Depardieu in ""Jean,"" ""Manon"" carries on flawlessly with the continued brilliant performances of Montand and Auteuil, enhanced by the new leading role of Bart. As with engaging novels, these films offer a perfect balance of suspense and surprise as the tale is told.

Regarding the earlier review which stated

""warning- young children should probably not wtch [sic] the first 15 min of the second part"" :

It is true on the one hand that brief nudity early in ""Manon"" can be seen as an unfortunate flaw, rendering what could have been a ""perfect"" G-rated family film into a ""PG-rated"" film. Before this latest American MGM re-release, one frequently saw a ""cleaned up""(censored) South-Korean version of ""Manon"" for sale, a viable option for those with objections to the nudity.

On the other hand, ""Manon"" is a rare instance in which film nudity does not seem blatantly salacious but rather natural and beautiful. Parents of young children know that some ""PG"" films are really ""G"" films, while others are more accurately PG-13 (or worse). Of equal if not greater concern in this regard is a potentially unsettling use of needle and thread and an associated bloody wound, not so long after the aforementioned nudity in ""Manon."" This probably has more to do with the ""PG"" rating than nudity.

Despite considering myself hyper-vigilant about what films my children can watch (from early childhood through teen years), I decided that ages seven and up in my family could watch those two potentially objectionable scenes. No great discourse was required other than helping to explain the character's state of mind and/or emotion in the second scene.",1190160000,5,2366,5.11139896373057

There are no extras, but I don't feel I need them - the films speak for themselves.  You must select the subtitles - each time I stopped the film I had to reset them - a minor bother.

2308536,5,B0009P7EI2,"For those who haven't seen these films originally released in the 80s, I give them my highest review.  They're well worth seeing and everything from the story to the characters to the beautiful cinematography in the French village and countryside is exceptional.  Another reviewer pointed out that the translation is a bit off in the subtitles.  I've watched these films many times over the years both with and without subtitles and while there are obvious differences, I don't have a problem with them to the extent that the other reviewer did.  Examples of differences that I picked up are quoting lengths in inches (presumably for an American audience) rather than the original centimeters.  Several slang terms and phrases are also not translated literally sometimes eliminating little jokes and so on, but I don't think that detracts from the film at all.

Now as for the packaging, this new release is bare bones.  Technically the picture, and sound are improved over previous releases in my opinion.  It's presented in widescreen though not in an HD format.  Refer to the other reviews for the technical mumbo-jumbo, but it looked great to me.  The two subtitling choices are English and Spanish.  Jean de Florette is on one side of the disc and the sequel on the other.  That's it.  There's nothing else.  They could certainly have dome more here, but for the price, who's complaining?

Highly recommended!!!!!  (one exclamation point for each star)",1186531200,81,1457,5.008333333333334
2308537,4,B0009P7EI2,"Two big steps forward, and one 1/2 step back. Contrary to the impression from the disc specs on the back of the jacket, the new MGM/Fox double feature disc DOES present the films  16:9 enhanced. They are also, surprisingly a big step up from the earlier R2 PAL discs , which for the longest time were the only way to satisfyingly watch these on a widescreen display or front projector.
Unfortunately they still aren't a home run.  The picture in general consistently looks a little too 'hot' - contrast is jacked up which blows out the details in the highlights in many shots- also there is an at times over bearing yellow tint to the image in the countryside exteriors. Some EE and ringing are also  visible in a few shots. Fine detail on the other hand is much improved over the PAL disc and artifacts related to  compression are a monumental improvment over the first MGM release.
These should have been color timed a bit cooler- but on the whole, this new release easily represents the most watchable versions of these two classics yet (at least, not counting the widescreen Image laserdisc set that is now long out of print).

Its a shame that this release is so close, and yet still misses the mark. At least this one will suffice for a few years until the film are (hopefully) properly presented on one or both of the High Def formats.
The films themselves get 5 stars easy- the new disc gets 3.5 for PQ and AQ.",1185580800,90,1418,4.48062015503876
2308538,5,B0009P7EI2,Just wanted to write a quick review to let people know that these are anamorphic and the picture looks great. I was almost scared off from buying this by all the reviews from people who obviously hadn't seen this disc yet but decided to write a review anyway claiming it was not anamorphic.,1185580800,5,290,4.490566037735849
2308539,5,B0009P7EI2,"I'm editing my review. In my case, I'm an obsessive fan of these movies, and maybe nothing would've met my expectations. If you haven't seen these films, buy this DVD IMMEDIATELY! You will not be sorry, and more than likely you'll find my criticisms baseless and nit-picky.

I wrote the original after skipping around the discs and being extremely disappointed by what I saw. Since then, I've sat down and watched both movies on this disc and my opinion has changed somewhat. The problem was my expectations, not the actual product.

On the whole, these films DO look fantastic when compared to every other DVD release available (MGM and the R2 Pathe discs from France). However, they don't look nearly as good as I believe possible. I think this film deserves the royal treatment, an all new, high definition transfer by seriously skilled people.

Unfortunately, while the resolution is good, it is anamorphic, and appears to be a straight NTSC transfer (and not a PAL-to-NTSC conversion as I previously thought), there is just something not right. The colors are way too hot when compared to the actual film, and there just seems to be a layer of fuzz or blur over the whole thing that is not present on the big screen.

I give it 5 stars because the films are fantastic. The two greatest foreign films I've ever seen. I've watched them each about 15 times, and never grow tired of them. I pretty much learned French watching these movies.

However, this DVD seriously lacks. This movie is in dire need of a new and improved subtitle translation. While the subtitles make sense on the whole, I've studied the French script, and there is a great deal missing in the translation.

There are no special features.

For YEARS, these films have been out of print in America, the originals going for upwards of $50 a piece on ebay. Clearly someone was paying attention and realized there's enough people who enjoy this movie to make it available again. But slapping this set together, while allowing new viewers the opportunity to see the films, is an insult to fans who've waited a LOOOONG time for a proper American release. But a cheap release is better than none at all.

Caveat: Perhaps if enough people buy this DVD, MGM will wake up and release a proper special edition. For $14, it's a great deal for two masterpieces, but we could've done better than this.",1185408000,211,2360,4.711165048543689

I wanted to buy the new release - if not better, at least I could let friends borrow two of my favorite movies for long periods of time. Yes - the 2 movies are on separate sides of the same DVD yet I still deem this superior to the original DVDs due to:
1 - Anamorphic Image
2 - Smaller, less annoying SUBTITLES (the original releases used huge letters for the subtitles).",1185321600,3,445,4.247058823529412

You don't have to speak French (or read the English subtitles, for that matter) to understand this movie. It is that perfect. I don't remember when I first saw this movie. I consider it one movie in two sequels with each sequel standing on its own as a complete cinematic drama. The acting is superb. At the climax of the drama, in Manon des Sources, the realization of the horrible truth on Cesar's (Yves Montand) face and in his eyes needed no words and had none. For me, everything that Gerard Depardieu has done pales to his portrayal of the happy but unlucky Jean De Florette.  Daniel Auteuil is nearly unrecognizable in his protrayal of Galinette.  This is a classic. Insular, provincial Provence provides the perfect backdrop for this drama spanning generations. We are all flawed, imperfect beings capable, through our actions, of terrible things that have horrible consequences.  Every time I watch it I see something new.
