I liked it mainly because it copied real life situations and solved them by outsmarting the situation, excellent morals to be taught. Was delivered quickly and in tact.",1296950400,,291,4.615384615384615
8371550,5,B002JPF89M,"I saw this movie with my kids in the 1990's for the first time. It was recorded on a vcr tape that we had acquired. It was fantastic and very entertaining. I didn't see it again for many years and decided to see if Amazon had it. They did, I ordered it and it is still fantastic. Ever bit as funny as I recall. Yes, I recommend it! My kids liked it as well. We used to watch it over and over. (Which is why the tape wore out.) I ordered the English version which has a great British accent voice over. And done well, although I've never seen the French version.",1293494400,,561,4.017857142857143
8371551,5,B002JPF89M,"What a great movie!
I had seen it as a kid in the 80's then several times growing up: it has always been a family favourite. What a pleasure to find it here as a Zone 1 DVD! And it is great that both English and French versions (no subtitles) are available on the same DVD.
The story itself has not aged a bit and the ""house that drives you mad"" will delight anybody who ever had to deal with administrations! Everything is appropriate for both young children and adults, who will all be entertained. Of course, the images could be refreshed a little but it doesn't take anything off this Asterix classic.

On the DVD:
Film in French
Film in English
No bonus- No language or set-up options.

More than recommended: a must-have family classic!!!",1283904000,3,744,4.463235294117647

I was afraid when I first opened it that I had mistakenly ordered the french version, especially since it is packaged and looks so french and even came from french Canada! But it was the same voices that I remember growing up with! This film isn't for those who are looking for a serious subject matter! It is very uncouth and definetely not designed for accuracy! My kids love it same as I did and have each chosen their favorite tasks. My oldest son loves it when obelix eats the huge meal. I personally love the ""place that sends you mad""! But it is all fabulous. From geriatrix the old guy, to brutus playing with a knife and cutting his finger, and even the women on the isle of pleasure who are sirens and then become fish wives! It is simply hysterical! And I usually don't go in for this type of humor, but it isn't over the top. The dvd looks wonderful too! It transfered very well to this medium! Definately WORTH the price! But make sure if you are english speaking you get the english cover vesion!",1272844800,10,1103,4.333333333333333
