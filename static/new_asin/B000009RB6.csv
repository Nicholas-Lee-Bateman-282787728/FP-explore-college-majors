7905642,5,B000009RB6,"In IGOR AND THE LUNATICS (1985), a Manson family-like cult of drug-addled hippies, led by a man in a bad wig, named Paul (T.J. Michaels), terrorizes a small, rural town. Fed up, the law moves in, rounding up and arresting the group. All, except for a baby. Sixteen years later, Paul is released from prison. Now, w/ the squeaky, ranting, homicidal Igor (Joe Niola), and others of his cult, Paul, in his real hair, sets out for vengeance on the townspeople he holds responsible for his incarceration. Bloody, gory nonsense ensues, while Igor raves, howls, and squawks. Igor is one of the most absurd, laughable characters in horror movie history! He's Squiggy from LAVERNE AND SHIRLEY, Jerry Lewis, the Tasmanian Devil, and a hamster, all in one economical package! And! He's!! Cra-Zeee!!! While all of the characters in IATL are godawful, Igor wins the ""most convincing case of living brain death"" award, hands -and feet- down! His screeching is matched only by his two facial expressions, rocketing between stunned idiocy and a cackling jack-o-lantern. Paul wins the ""most annoyingly nonthreatening cult leader"" award. Dismal, dreadful, and dumber than a boulder w/ ears, this movie must be seen, as no human could possibly describe its imbecilic charms properly! As w/ most supra-schlock of this caliber, it's difficult to rate. It's either a one or a five star ""film"", depending on the mood the viewer might be in at the time. I was in a jolly mood, and guffawed all the way through! The sounds of punches and strikes w/ heavy or sharp objects are like the noises made by sides of beef hitting a barn door! SMACKKKK! Still, this is better than the melon-headed dialogue or ""acting""! Yes, this is indeed a TROMA production. EXTRA POINTS: For learning the Igor yowl- Hrrrhh-Aaaahh-Yaaa!...  P.S.- Be sure to stick around for Igor's final ""after-death"" appearance! It's a screaming fit from hell, and a divine experience!... P.P.S.- Paul's death is even funnier!...",1506297600,,1965,4.990853658536586

7905646,1,B000009RB6,"This is an early Troma attempt at making bad films that we like. The production modestly opens up with ""Troma, movies of the future."" The film starts off with Sara (Constance Rodgers) getting her topped ripped off and then tied down and sawed in half with the proverbial buzz saw. Don't worry if you missed the scene, they need to show it a few more times to fill up the 82 minutes of the movie.

The film is in part told as a confusing flashback with a woman reading a diary of past events to explain things to her, although she is part of those events and know what is going on. Film editors shouldn't do drugs. Paul is a religious cult leader. Tom leaves the cult and when Sara wants to leave, we get to see the opening scene again. The cult goes to prison, then when they get out, they go on a killing spree, with Tom as one of the targets...I think that is what it is about.

Troma has not yet perfected its body organ effects as yet and concentrates more on blood than guts and head rolls. Product placement and women getting their blouses ripped open are the highlights of this production.

The DVD extras are basically the ones included with all Troma films.

7905647,3,B000009RB6,"In the late 60's, a former murderous hippie cult leader named Igor and his maniacs caused terror in the town of Tromaville. Luckily the town's folk had him locked up in prison only that 16 years later he is a reformed man, his gang unites with him so they can get revenge on those that sent him to prison.

Not too shabby effort from Troma inspired by the crimes of Charles Manson but not based on them. It's a little slow at times but really gets going on some of the gore and torture sequences like a chick being sawed in half by a buzzsaw machine or the climatic fight scene, there is some nice nudity thrown into the movie. This is one of Troma's weakest movies only saved by a few redeeming qualities.

This DVD contains an ok DVD Transfer and some nifty extras like an interactive tour of the Troma building, The Troma Intelligence Test, Production stills, trailers to this and other Troma movies, Troma's Edge TV episodes, Aroma Du Troma, special message from Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Hertz, Gyno Talk bit, and more.",1196899200,,1024,4.5
7905648,2,B000009RB6,"And the fact that this one is so confusing does most definitely work against it. I had a lot of trouble following the plotline of this film. Further, it is not really very frightening at all, being instead rather  tedious. The story is about a serial killer who leads a cult of hippies  (gee, I wonder where they got this idea from). The lead character is not  even the one named Igor! In the movie Igor is just a member of this  murderous group.  This is one that you can skip. Even the added  features on the DVD aren't worth the time.",962236800,3,537,4.215686274509804
