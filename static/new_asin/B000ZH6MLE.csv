8235426,2,B000ZH6MLE,"The movie version of the anime is pretty good for a live action movie...

The only problem is the subtitles are horribly done. It's almost like the directors tried to use an online translator. A jumble of english words are thrown together.

You should be able to speak fluent Japanese if you want to watch this movie and understand.

That, or watch the anime so religiously that you don't need subtitles to enjoy the movie.",1256774400,3,423,4.613333333333333
8235427,4,B000ZH6MLE,"Silver-haired and mysterious, he wanders through Japan helping people who are plagued with mushi -- mysterious supernatural creatures.

And while most live action movies adapted from anime/manga are tepid CGI-heavy affairs, ""Mushi-Shi: The Movie"" is an ethereal, atmosphere-soaked piece of work that shows the brilliant Katsushiro Otomo at his best. The storyline is kind of fragmented as it explains the protagonists' history, but the eerie plot and hauntingly lush backdrop of medieval Japan make this an exquisite piece of work, with a subtle tinge of horror.

A silver-haired wanderer -- a ""mushi-shi"" or ""bugmaster"" -- named Ginko (Joe Odagin) takes shelter in a small village, where the local matriarch asks him to help with some problems. One is that some of the villagers have gone deaf in one ear; the other is that her granddaughter is hearing bizarre things that aren't there, and grown a pair of strange horns from her forehead. With his know-how and an assortment of herbs, Ginko manages to deal with the problems.

While all this is going on, we see a silver-haired woman named Nui (Makiko Esumi) adopt a child whose mother died in a landslide. She urges him to go in case the local mushi affect him, but she grows fond of the boy -- leading to a magical and horrifying transformation for them both.

But new problems arise when Ginko travels to the Tanyuu household, home of a bizarre hereditary mushi and a vast store of mushi-related information. The mistress of the house (Y Aoi) has become mysteriously ill, and information about a kind of mushi called the Tokoyami stirs old memories in Ginko. And as he tries to seal away the mushi that threaten to swarm through the mansion, he comes face-to-face with a tormented soul from his past...

""Mushi-Shi: The Movie"" reminds me a little of ""Dororo,"" only with lovelier landscapes and less messy monster-slaying. The only real problem with this movie is the fragmented storyline, especially since the first half is a series of interconnected vignettes and flashbacks -- half is backstory, and half is about Ginko's ability to seek out mushi and deal with them.

But Otomo manages to keep the plot threads of past and present woven into a shimmering web, and the second half is a beautiful, painful expanse full of danger, blood and past pain. And we see how deadly the mushi can be, rather than the minor pests and nebulous dangers in the first.

It's a beautiful piece of work, roaming languidly through lush leafy forests, pale misty light, and deep woodland ponds fringed with trees -- it's utterly gorgeous. One particularly haunting moment is when we see of Nui and the boy Yoki ""flying"" in deep pondwater, murmuring to each other as they drift. And the beauty of most of it makes the horrific parts (including a piece of clothing slowly filling itself with swarming darkness) even darker and more ghastly.

Joe Odagin (with a headful of silver dye) does a pretty good job as the perpetually mellow Ginko, who gradually seems to awaken emotionally when a crisis arises that he can't immediately fix. Makiko Esumi is absolutely brilliant as Nui, Nao Omori has a good supporting role as Ginko's rainbow-hunting sidekick, and Aoi has an excellent small role as a legendary mushi-shi who is infected with one herself (and deals with it by writing about them).

""Mushi-shi: The Movie"" is a visually lush, slow-moving piece of fantasy, relying on subtlety and a strange brand of ""bugs"" that can only be dead with by a mushishi. It requires some patience, but it's a beautiful piece of work.",1245110400,,3553,4.87893864013267
8235428,4,B000ZH6MLE,"Got this on E-Bay after viewing the trailer on Twitch.  The subs are so unintelligible that the viewing is max-cool mind-boggling, actually. (""Dororo"" subs are equally as mangled/cryptic.)  This is good looking, hyper stylized live action version of the comic.  There is lots of stuff about insects invading ear drums and gooey/floating stuff.  Not much insect-fu or mystic-fu, but a lot of great scenery.  Impossible to really comment on or understand what is happening here until a different translation is attached to this flic.  Still, I'm intrigued enough by this disc, as is,  to maybe re-buy after a N. American release is (if ever) marketed.",1204934400,5,649,5.123809523809523
