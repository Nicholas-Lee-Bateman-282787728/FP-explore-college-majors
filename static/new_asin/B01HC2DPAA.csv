8764925,5,B01HC2DPAA,If you are not a perfectionist then you will like this. I played with a drummer that would get upset if we were playing the live version vs the studio version or vice versa of certain songs. I really did not care as long as it sounded good and I believe most people listening feel the same way. I have a couple of these DVD's in the series and I find it a shortcut to breaking down the songs yourself and good enough to get you up to speed for your next gig. If you are a pure Ozzy Cover Band you may want more detail in my opinion. If you are a beginner and you want to work at it don't expect to learn overnight but a nice step over tablature and a cd as you can see one guitarists way to get to the notes you need to sound like Ozzy's guitarist at a particular time. So many guitarists so many interpretations.,1520294400,,813,3.9634146341463414
