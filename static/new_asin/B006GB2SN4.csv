8497460,4,B006GB2SN4,"This 1978 documentary called UFO Journals was yet another one of those strings of low-budget UFO documentaries that surfaced in the 1970s, along the lines of Overlords of the UFO, Mysteries from Beyond Earth, and similar documentaries, even In Search Of... with Leonard Nimoy whenever UFOs are covered (like UFOs in 1976 or UFO Captives in 1978). UFO Journals starts off with strange electronic music, a bible quote from Genesis, and the intro theme song, which I thought was a cool piece of electronic music. Almost consistently throughout the movie you get treated with eerie sound effects. The narrator go on about various UFO sightings. They talk about some California businessman named Brian Scott who claims he's channeling an alien named Voltair and how he got a tattoo of a spider while traveling to South America. There's mention of Kirlean photography (where the narrator mispronounces it as ""Kirillean""), and there's Dr. Elan Neev who, for some strange reason, plays a ""Healing song from the Holy Land"", which sounds to me like a klezmer song played on his harmonica. He talks to the lady about her chakras, and uses this devices with a crystal attached to it. You even have Ruth Norman of the Unarius Academy of Science who claimed a UFO would land and bring world peace soon. It never happened. This is one of the more far-out 1970s UFO documentaries I have ever seen. It helps that the strange creepy electronic sound effects are used throughout, not to mention you really can't believe what's being presented here, since it's not convincing. But why would I rate it so high? Because I love these type of often poorly researched, low budget UFO documentaries. This is right up your alley if you enjoyed Overlords of the UFO.",1383868800,2,1738,4.875
