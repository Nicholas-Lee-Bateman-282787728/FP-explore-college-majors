4312633,4,B004AYMY92,"Okay so this film throughout was absolutely fantastic to watch, it did live up to its expectations for the time period and the location where it was shot. Valeria Solarino, Isabella Ragonese and the directors have done their homework! The scenes of lovemaking have you falling all over yourself, though visually the first scene was a bit dark it can be handled.
Solarino takes her character to a whole other level with her drive and determination.
This has definately ranked in my top 10 Lesbian films, and trust me, that's a hard list to make.
This film is a must watch!",1320105600,50,571,4.663366336633663
4312634,4,B004AYMY92,This story is a inserting one. You have to watch to find out. Over all the story is really cutie and sad at the same time. Watching this film just reinforces some common themes that always go along with story such as these.,1319155200,,223,4.209302325581396
4312635,3,B004AYMY92,"Not sure about this movie. I found it dark and depressing. Artful, probably, but I had trouble getting beyond the cruelty of the father. The few shared moments of joy were not enough to overcome the darkness for me.",1317340800,6,215,4.538461538461538

4312637,4,B004AYMY92,"This is another lesbian movie that shows us what a hetero-patriarchal society is like. I know this story happens in a different time period but yet we can still see many similarities with some foreign countries of our own time, how they view women in general and lesbians in particular. Angela, one of the leading characters, is quite an unusual woman, very brave and determined. It must have been hard to face all that rejection just for being authentic, and true to herself and others. There are many unexpected twists and turns along the movie, and some even border on the absurd. But, who knows how far one could go to be happy. I don't want to give away much information lest I take away the surprise factor out of it. Anyway, it's not a masterpiece, but it's a good foreign movie if you want to have a good time.",1314921600,3,818,4.46
4312638,4,B004AYMY92,"Well I have to say I really enjoyed this film. If you can't handle subtitles then don't bother. It was quite different than most lady love films I have seen. Very interesting and unexpected twists and turns. What some of the woman endure is beyond me. Fighting back a  violent patriarchal rule, and pursuing happiness. Is it ever attainable? Nothing is as it seems. The emotion these actors portray is painful and raw.. Amazing !!  Four stars because I love Foreign films. If your looking for a silly American love film this is not it. The depth of love these woman have one could only dream about. Serious film watchers only. In my view well,well worth the time. Vague yes, but I don't want to give it away.",1314316800,12,708,4.5234375

4312641,4,B004AYMY92,"This romantic drama set in the past on a picturesque Italian island is memorable and moving.  The story of two girlhood friends who fall in love is very well done.  The film  is well directed and the production is professional and quite lyrical.  The movie like many European movies moves at a leisurely pace while the story background is set-up.  The period is depicted realistically and the performances are strong.  The woman Angela and Sara are utterly convincing as the lovers whose devotion to each other is sweetly conveyed.
The other characters arn't as realistic, especially Angela's father who is portrayed as a sterotypical villain and her weak mother both come across as annoying.
Overall this is an good period film with great performances from the two gorgeous women who rebel against the restrictions placed upon their love.",1301961600,45,839,5.043478260869565

The father is very abusive... but actually was the reason why Angela could disguise herself as a man... Very interesting movie, well written, and very well acted.

4312665,4,B004AYMY92,"I will start off by saying that I really liked this film and will certainly watch it more than once.  The actresses have a natural chemistry and devotion, and are very sweet togetherand Valeria Solarino is one of the most beautiful women that I have ever seen (sorry honey).  The fact that this film is based on a true story makes it even more interesting.

Other reviewers have said that some of the scenes are poorly lit and consequently very dark. They weren't kidding. Would it have been too much trouble for the filmmakers to have dredged up another light bulb or two before filming?  Instead of dialog subtitles for those scenes, it would have been more helpful to have had subtitles explaining what was going on.

The movie is also dark in other ways. Angelas father is an abusive monster and a few scenes are difficult to watch. If you have PTSD around this issue, this is probably not the movie for you.

It does have that choppiness common to Italian films (think Rossellini). You are in one place and then bam somewhere else for no apparent reason - and then boom somewhere else again. A little disorienting but you get used to it.  The movie was filmed in Sicily so there are naturally a lot of rocks, cliffs and hills - but it is still very lovely and the turbulent sea is frequently the back drop.

With all of that said, I found the strength and resiliency of these characters (particularly Angela) very appealing, the story interesting and the love scenes were love scenes, not sex scenes.  A welcome and refreshing change.",1431043200,,1539,4.587591240875913

I am also one who hates it when I see a film that has people who are playing lovers but don't seem connected or into it but this film did not disappoint.,1428710400,,426,3.797752808988764

I really think it jumped the shark when the father of one of the main characters locked up his daughter in a cellar because she was ""perverted"" and then was convinced by his wife later to let her live as a man.  It didn't make any sense to me but then again, I was fast forwarding through chunks by this time so maybe I missed something (but I doubt it).  Oh so happy ending when one of the main characters dies giving birth.  That seemed a bit predictable as well.

**** Italian with English subtitles ****

This was surprisingly very good.  The leads are beautiful and have some amazing chemistry.

Set in 19th century Sicily, a friendship between two women turns to passion when Angela (the brunette) declares her love for her best friend.  Angela is the unwanted daughter of an abusive father (he wanted a boy) who is also an important man as the local quarry foreman. Sara is her childhood friend who left the island but returns in adulthood as a servant to the island's all-powerful Baron.  Their friendship is rekindled and a passionate affair ensues.  When an arranged marriage lurks on the horizon, Angela shamelessly declares her love for Sara, setting off a chain of dark and unexpected events.  The circumstances in which Angela is led to pass as a man is more than a little odd... if the story hadn't been inspired by true events, I might even call it a bit crazy and silly.

I loved these leads together.  Very emotional and rang true.  Even though Angela had a bit of a handsome face... I just about cried when she began to transition into a man... she was too sexy-beautiful and I loved all that wild long hair!  There was no way I thought she'd pass for a dude.  But my goodness... she was something.  Strikingly sexy and boyish... she is filmed just so with the right lighting and at the right angles to look oh so deliciously androgynous.  I was attracted to her all over again... so wonderfully confusing, lol.  Love it.  So I was very, very impressed with this aspect of the story.

Soon Angela/Angelo's new identity forces her to be her father's son and to take responsibilities at work for him.  These challenges frighten her but she soon enough adapts and develops her male identity.  Despite the challenges... she gets plenty of man perks, including her Sara.

Really just loved all of these characters.  Sara was very VERY appealing in her own right... just the kind of woman you wanna marry, indeed. And the flirty Baron's wife was a wonderful little perk to the storyline, lol.

And just when I thought this would be one of the best lez-themed films I've ever seen.... the ending horrified me.  Ack.  I couldn't give it 5 stars for depressing me in the end.  I still loved it, but damn.  I don't even care if that was true.  I'd of preferred a happier ending.  Other shortcomings were that some of these scenes are just way too dark and hard to see... and the flashforwards make much more sense on a second viewing.  There is also some abusive and disturbing behavior by Angela's father which is unsettling to watch, but not over the top. Overall, I still loved it.  I wanted it to be a TV series where we watched their lives carry on and on...

There is nudity and graphic f/f sex and one graphic m/f sex scene.  All tastefully done. The f/f scenes were done so beautifully... again, just those perfectly choreographed shots where Angela/Angelo looks so boyish and is contrasted appealingly with Sara's womanly figure.  Nicely done.",1414713600,2,3005,4.660952380952381

According to the commentary in the movie, this fish has the ability to change its gender. And this gender bending is core to this true story of two women growing up together in a small fishing village in Sicily and falling in love. This presents a problem in a very conservative, deeply religious community but the solution is daring! It's a beautiful story. The acting is superb.

4312692,5,B004AYMY92,"In a word - wonderful.  This is now my equal favorite with Elena Undone.  I agree with one of the reviewers - too bad I can't read the book, supposedly based on a true story.  It might explain/clarify one or two of the puzzling scenes and characters (the father and the Baroness).  But must say that this film is very, very well done and that the actresses were terrific in conveying overwhelming love, tenderness and genuine passion.  I wish I understood Italian, since a couple of sub titles did not match what was really said (I understand Spanish and a little of school book Italian), so I wonder what might I have missed throughout.  These are legit actors in this film.  In fact, Maria Grazia, a top Italian actress is also - if I read the credits correctly - a producer as well as playing Agnes. The lovely music flows well with the movie and both the men and a few women were eye-candy, especially Valeria Solarino.  Quite a brave pair these two given the time period it takes place in.  In this particular case, love does conquer all.  You can't help being caught up in it and I plan to buy it.  I'm positive this film is not for everybody, but for those romantic, quixotic souls out there - yes indeed it is!  The end left me wanting to know more - does Angela/Angelo revert to her true nature as a proud woman or remain disguised as a man as she was forced to in order to obtain her Sara?  It begs an answer..............",1392940800,4,1432,4.3584905660377355

Somehow, Angela blossoms into a strong-willed, fiercely independent girl and young woman despite her father's cruelty and abuse. Her best friend is Sara, whom she loves passionately, and as a young woman, Angela falls deeply in love with her and refuses to be parted from her. Here the family takes a perverse turn. Unable to dissuade Angela from her love for Sara, they force her to live as a man and blackmail the local priest to change her birth certificate and rename her Angelo. As Angelo, she takes up work with her father in the quarry and marries Sara. Sadly, it is her intense love for Sara and her eagerness to fulfill Sara's every desire that leads to a tragic end.

4312703,4,B004AYMY92,"It's a good movie. The story is a bit farcical, hardly believable but I realize now that the lesbian story is not the main point of the movie, rather it is duplicity. Almost every character in this movie has a duplicate self, a parallel self, that comes out during the movie, sometimes with pathos, sometimes not. The storyline is about the love between two women in southern Italy sometime in the late 19th century. But the movie should not be watched for the lesbian story, rather - here is the twist - for the duplicity of all characters. The duplicity of the main character is the life she is forced to live to be able to be with the woman she loves. I do believe, however, that this is the excuse for the narrative to delve on the duplicity of life at large, something that most of us have to endure in life. Maybe this duplicity is sexual orientation, maybe it is an illicit affair, or maybe it is painful guilt  the main point of the movie IMHO is precisely to tell several stories of duplicity and how that affects our social interactions, our families, our lives.

The movie is in italian, but, as a note for those looking for italian spoken movies, it is strongly regional italian, precisely sicilian.",1390089600,,1211,4.5

4312713,5,B004AYMY92,"This is a wonderful film. I wouldn't limit it to 'gay' film and would recommend it to anyone interested in the nature of love and has even half an open mind. It touches much broader aspects of life, the transcendence of love, the female archetype, societal roles, the conflict that can arise when following one's heart and it does it in a beautiful way.  It is about two women who are very much in love. One, so very sure about love and its expressions, bearing the weight and cost of that (societal) naivete. It takes a few minutes for the other to catch up which seems natural when one is offered a possibility they didn't know existed. Sex is truly an expression of their love. It doesn't hurt they take off their clothes because it hits the societal role issues head on. It's also aesthetically beautiful and took my breath away.  The film a complex emotional story; well acted and well directed. The message: be who you are.
At first, I was a little disappointed it was a period piece but that flew out the window by the fifth minute. It is in Italian, so be prepared to read if you don't speak it.

Angela;s Father arranges for her to marry one of the men that work for him ,it is at this point Angela rebels  telling her Father she loves Sara. and will not marry the man he has chosen.

4312750,5,B004AYMY92,"On a windswept 19th century Italian island, rebellious Angela (Valeria Solarino) fears no one, not even her brutal, overbearing father. When Angela falls in love with best friend Sara (Isabella Ragonese), she wants to be with no one but her. Angela's father attempts to force her into marriage are useless; she states that she will only marry Sara. When her father's violence forces her into a basement dungeon, she chooses death rather than marry the man her father has chosen for her.

Angela's mother Lucia comes up with an ingenious solution, which involves Angela becoming the son her father had always wanted. As Lucia has information that the local priest would prefer not come to light, she blackmails him into changing Angela's sex on the birth register. Once Angela is officially Angelo, she cuts her hair, dons men's clothing, and marries her sweetheart, Sara. Life seems idyllic for the women living as husband and wife; however, there are rumblings beneath the surface of the small community.

Based on the novel Minchia di Re by Giacomo Pilati, Donatella Maiorca brings to the screen a wonderful period piece of young love and strong female characters that challenge societal norms in order to be together. The weather beaten Sicilian coast is a breathtaking backdrop for the women's growing passion and intense love scenes. This expertly woven drama is based on a true story.

The incredibly talented leads Valeria Solarino and Isabella Ragonese are both stunning. The chemistry between the women is so genuine that their ardent loves scenes appear incredibly real. Even Valeria Solarino cropped locks do nothing to diminish her statuesque beauty.

4312756,4,B004AYMY92,"Let me say first off that I really loved this movie.  Because I've seen too many lesbian movies that were just so (!!!) badly made, acted, scripted, etc.,-I went into this film with really low expectations.  However, I loved the story so much that I searched for the book to read (unfortunately it has no English version...and the book is tantalizingly based on a true story ) and actually purchased the dvd.  Something I rarely do.
Purple Sea captured the period of turn-of-the-century Italy, small village life, and the societal expectations/superstitions of and for women.  (The power of the Catholic church in small village life was especially interesting. )  Probably no surprise is that Jaguar and Aimee, (1999 German made) another very well done period (WWII) lesbian movie is also one of my all-time favorites. This movie compares pretty closely IMO.

The acting was first rate, although I didn't know any of the actors-I think the father and both lead actresses are fairly well known in Europe.  Both actresses did a fantastic job in their roles and there seemed to be plenty of chemistry between them....

I did give it four stars because there were several scenes that did not transition into the next scene smoothly.  It made the movie seem a little ""choppy"" and some scenes left questions unanswered as the film moved forward into the story.  Also, though it might be because I didn't change settings on my computer screen...many scenes were just dark.  So dark that it was hard to see what was going on.  I'll add to this review when I receive and watch the dvd on my tv.  My biggest complaint?  I really, really wish the book had an English translation.",1362787200,12,1668,4.786713286713287

A controlling male who justifies his own amoral behavior and a woman who does what is necessary to survive and to be happy.  A tragedy in the Shakespearean sense.  It's not just one tiny fish in the sea that changes from female to male (biologically and behaviorally), there are many species of fish and invertebrates that are either simultaneous or sequential hermaphrodites.  Some begin life as males, and change into females; others begin life as females, and change into males.  Some are both male and female throughout their lives!  But, we are not talking about biological changes in this story, only behavioral changes necessary for a couple to be together.  Love between people of the same gender has always existed in human populations. Denial of love between two adults, simply to conform to what society deems right and wrong is always tragic.  Thank goodness society is progressive.",1340496000,9,974,5.04375
4312766,5,B004AYMY92,"This film is beautifully tragic on a number of levels. Based on a true story, Italian beauty Angela grows up fiesty but with a very hateful father. Meanwhile her dear friend, Sara, is more reserved. Taken from one another in childhood, Angela waits for Sara's return. Sara does finally return, both are grown and the reunion is happy.
The movie is a bit fast to move Angela's feelings for Sara in some ways without showing perhaps she's always harbored romantic feelings for her.
Without giving much away, this is absolutely a wonderful watch. If you're looking for a good date night movie to get in the mood, you might want to pass. There are sexually charged moments, but again, it's very bittersweet. If you're looking to just curl up on the couch with a good flick, absolutely worth the time. For those of us who don't speak Italian, there are subtitles, but overall, who doesn't speak the language of love?
So, on the love-meter? 3.5. Good scenes, great acting, but might not land a lot of action in the boudoir.

Who can deny that to life a life that is honest is not the best way to be, what else can make you happy but putting your head down at night knowing you are at peace with yourself.  That is how this film made me feel, empowered.  Beautiful people, yes, beautiful island, undoubtedly, but the message is clear.  LIVE.",1326499200,,481,4.184782608695652

It is based on a book that was written in Italian and I wish for it in English so I can read it.  I'd like to know more about the real story that inspired the author.  The music is captivating too.  London Orchestra plays the theme and it is so beautiful.",1492473600,,422,4.073170731707317

One of the most unsettling movies to date. If this is what the writer/director was trying to accomplish, job well done. There should be at least a small pay off for all the misery, pain, and suffering the main actor sustained at the hands of her loving father.",1474848000,2,427,4.283950617283951
8421209,5,B004AYMY92,"Wow!! this film left me speechless.  Amazing plot and a story line!! The father actually became my favorite towards the end. He basically let his daughter due what ever she pleased in the second part of the film as long as she would learn the business, which was also very weird for the main character she didn't really have any interests in life except being in love of course so I thought that was very fair.  He definitely played a big roll in her character development throughout the film.  Amazing performance by both actresses and definitely very good screen chemistry between the two. :-))",1471824000,,596,4.711538461538462
