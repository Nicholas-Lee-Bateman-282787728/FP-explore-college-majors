If you've read any of my reviews on there movies and other music DVD's then you know how much I love Twins. Hailing form Hong Kong, Twins are the pop princess's of cantopop. I don't know a single word of cantonese, but there music is addictive, very catchy and fun to listen to. Not only is the music good, but both Gillian and Charlene are just so beautiful to stare at. This is a 3 disc set concert DVD in widescreen and DTS surround sound. A 3 night concert event, all captured here on this 3 disc set, totaling to almost 3 hours of concert!",1391385600,,659,4.32258064516129
