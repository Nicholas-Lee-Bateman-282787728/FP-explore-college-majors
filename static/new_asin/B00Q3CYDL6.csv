6853663,3,B00Q3CYDL6,"Can we say mixed emotions? A confused child learns to do what he must to get what he wants most... freedom.. or what he thought was freedom.. ruled by what his family wants for him and what he wants for himself, he finds himself in another country still searching for himself, his truth and his freedom. It's Okay but once was enough. Does the title suggest that the Salvation Army saves him or that he finds himself at the Salvation Army or the Salvation Army is the place to find freedom?",1429228800,,490,4.395604395604396
6853664,3,B00Q3CYDL6,"Well, I'll give it three.  I like foreign gay movies, I'm interested in Morocco, and on that level it delivers. But I like a plot to my movie, and there's just not much there.  It's gorgeous visually, but the plot is so thin that even the brief Amazon blurb reads more into it than actually happens.  It's not so much a story as an evolving grubby situation illustrated by elegant cinematic vignettes. Ending? Resolution? Not really, no, it just stops at one point with the implication that something has changed. The first reviewer had it right: see it once, maybe, don't need to see it again.

6853668,2,B00Q3CYDL6,Odd. A bunch of scenes shown in life order. Interesting to see how others live and how other lives are lived. In the end an experience I had already sadly forgotten about until the request to write this review.,1441065600,,210,4.410256410256411

6853674,3,B00Q3CYDL6,"I actually liked the film very much. The ending is abrupt and mysterious, and I don't care for it. I feel like I've heard a joke but wasn't told the punch line.  Somehow, I think it has to do with that song. If someone could tell me what those words mean, maybe I'll get it.

The story moves slow, and it should. It feels authentic to the pace of life in Morocco. There's a bit of a hole with him showing up in Geneva - almost feels like a scene was dropped.

Even with these flaws, I liked the film. The acting was great. The subtitles were mostly very good. There was the scene where he is helping his brother shampoo his hair and the brother asks for a pene (sp?) and the boy almost chokes. In Spanish that word can mean comb or penis, and by his reaction, I'm pretty sure that was intended to be so here. Anyway, the subtitles translated that as brush. Kind of missed the point.

Yes, I would watch it again.",1434067200,4,912,4.135593220338983

6853682,3,B00Q3CYDL6,"This is not a move for a cheerful evening's viewing.  Abdellah Taia's cinematic roman a clef is a gritty, unvarnished view into the life of a Moroccan family, with all of its dysfunctional aspects, and into the life of its gay son.  In addition, it portrays the dark underside of much of the Islamic world in which there is rampant homosexuality and in which the aggressive sexual attention of older men toward younger men and boys is condoned, but in which the younger men are ofttimes socially stigmatized and not culturally allowed to have genuine relationships with other men as equals.

There are very good acting performances here, particularly those of Said Mrine as the young Abdalleh, Karim Ait M'Hand as his older version, Amine Ennaji as his brother Slimane, Malik El Hamaoui as his mother (she is quite good) and Abdelhak Switah as his father.  Most of the actors are Moroccan or, at least, of Moroccan descent.

The film itself creeps along at times with little major's occurring, and Abdalleh does seem rather aimless as he progresses through it.  Filmed in large part in Casablanca, Azenmour and El Jadida, Morocco, there are shots of the Moroccan cities and homes that appear to be taken out of a still life, but instead of romantic, medieval, Orientalist figures, the people in the foreground are modern, unromantic Moroccans.

Being a fictionalized account of the life of Abdalleh Taia, this movie portrays a journey.  We see how the environment he lives in changes and molds him.  It is an incomplete journey for the movie ends with much of his life untold.  One suspects that there could be another film's waiting to be made that will tell the rest of the story. What is revealed in it is the meaning of the movie's name for those who are wondering.

One thing that a viewer can take away from this film is that anything one can do alleviate the poverty in Morocco from buying Moroccan products to travelling there and pumping money into the economy in legitimate ways is a good thing.  This movie clearly shows the cost of underdevelopment and the effects that it has on ordinary human beings.  One does feel a sympathy for most of the people portrayed.

On the DVD, once can view the trailer for this movie itself, as well as the Strand trailers for ""Futuro Beach,"" ""The Way He Looks,"" ""Lilting"" and ""Stranger by the Lake.""  (""Stranger by the Lake is a wretched film, by the way.  On the other hand, ""The Way He Looks"" is wonderful.)

The movie is in Arabic and French with the option of English subtitles.

Ron's Grade: C

Anyone interested in the state of gays in the Middle East who wants to see more may want to take a look at the following films, two fictional and two documentary, ""The String,"" ""The Road to Love,"" 'Undressing Israel"" and ""Jihad for Love.""",1430870400,11,2784,4.6796714579055445

8690149,5,B00Q3CYDL6,"The Title for this DVD is very appropriate for the message in this film.  It is a docu-drama about realities of life for a teenager in the Muslim world of Morocco.  The Arabic language is a Romance dialect, and to be educated required learning another language like French, German or English.  Abdellah the teenage boy overcame this barrier by learning French.  In Morocco, it is a society and life of chaotic contradictions for a teenage boy to grow up in.  It was unclear whether Abdellah was homosexual by choice or introduced after forced sexual encounters by older men who were predators.  Although his family was superficial about muslim homosexuality it was a fact of life to be endured by any boy.  In addition, this film really presented the unvarnished environment of austerity in living conditions and poverty endured by an average family or unprivileged individual.  In European countries there is the traditional Salvation Army facility with rooms for overnight occupancy.  However in this film the Salvation Army is symbolic of a new start in living.  I have been on military tours in Europe and the Mediterranean region and observed how many Internationals crossed over from Arab nations to look for a better life in the nations of Europe.  It is neigh to impossible not to experience a degree of compassion over their struggles.  This film reached 5-gold-stars status in the bold relief of poor working class families in Morocco.",1460937600,5,1445,5.0
