8707049,5,B00UITXH7G,"I bought this for ""The Pursued its 1 & 2"".  This was aired in 1966 shortly after I had returned from a 2 1/2 year Mormon mission to Germany.  The ""coincidence"" of having these two episodes tell the story of a 19th century Mormon, his two wives, and the persecution they endured was particularly poignant in those circumstances.  I felt like the writers gave a particularly fair rendering of that social dilemma.  My great-grandfathers lived in Utah during that very period.  None of them were called upon to practice polygamy (though they certainly were in good standing in the church), but the stories linger on.

Aside from that, having these episodes (all 17 of them) rendered just like they played in 1966 complete with the ""Living Color"" introduction and other NBC artifacts of the time is a complete nostalgia trip.  The prints are gorgeous and look to be in mint condition.  Bonanza was very central to American TV culture at the time.  It was also the reason that many people acquired their first color television sets.  It, more than any other show of that decade, defined the progress in TV programming and color production values.  A great souvenir.",1497657600,2,1160,4.808080808080808

8707052,5,B00UITXH7G,I bought this because of Eric Fleming.  I believed for some time he had more range as an actor than his role as Gil Favor.  In my opinion he was very underrated.,1462233600,,161,4.0
