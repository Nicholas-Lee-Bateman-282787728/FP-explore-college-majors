8668573,3,B00LWI3OHA,"First, the DVD will not play on my DVD player hooked to my TV. It does play on my computer. The audio is fine and, of course, Anna Netrebko and the casts are great. However, the stage lighting at the Salzburg Festspiele is very poor and DG did nothing to improve the video. Some scenes are so dark that you can barely make out what is happening on the stage. What a disappointment!!",1417132800,5,382,4.2465753424657535
