8324224,2,B0006A9FVO,"This is actually a Korean movie from 1969 called ""A Fierce Animal."" It stars Sa Mi-Ja as a blind swordswoman who is searching for her mother and uncle while being persued by a brothel owner. It has a decidedly cheap feel with poor fights and mediocre acting. This movie does not star Sonny Chiba, as has he been falsely credited on many sites.",1164240000,,343,4.4603174603174605
