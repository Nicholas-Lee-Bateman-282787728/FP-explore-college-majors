8167829,3,B000MCH1B2,"This movie starts out with what is easily a classic and hilarious Prabhu Deva dance video, ""All Day Jolly Day"".  The boy meets girl story plays out well in the beginning of this movie, and Vadivelu and Vivek make great rivals for the affection of a completely oblivious dame.  Though there is a lot of comical mischief in this movie, the plot takes a serious turn and asks a lot of hard questions.  It also asks the audience to endure the strangest set of coincidences the writer could seem to cram into half of a movie.  If you like Prabhu Deva, you will like the first half of this film.",1246060800,,589,4.327272727272727
