1256254,5,B00002VW85,This film helped my students understand what they were reading.  We viewed it in small clips after reading segments of the story.,1395446400,,129,4.863636363636363
1256255,5,B00002VW85,"A classic! Not only do we feel the bitter cold, the shock of hidden dangers, the wisdom of instinct as the dog exemplifies, but we see a common type of character: careless, assuming, foolish. We also see the result of these qualities in a tragic way.",1394928000,,250,4.456521739130435

1256257,4,B00002VW85,I purchased as a English teacher for a follow-up assignment after reading London's short story.  The movie allows students to see the harsh conditions and allows them to experience the tremendous cold.,1388102400,,201,5.28125

1256261,1,B00002VW85,"Incredibly boring movie, one of the worst I've ever seen...thankfully, less than an hour long.  Unbelievably stupid Yukon miner starts out for a walk to somewhere, with only a dog, some matches, a knife, and a few biscuits.  It's supposed to be -75 outside but he takes off anyway.  Along the way, he treats the dog more like, well, a dog, than a useful friend.  He's always slapping and kicking him and later tries to kill the dog, I guess to warm his hands a la  Luke Skywalker but he can't even do that right.  He seems amazed to discover that if you build a fire under a tree with snow-filled branches, the snow might melt and fall into the fire.  What a moron.  I came to actually hate the guy before the movie ends, he's so dumb and mean, and I'm thrilled when the dog leaves him to freeze to death and walks off on its own.  Monotone Orson Wells narrative, annoying background music, poorly photographed.  PS  I have not read the story yet, so this review is based entirely on the movie.",1345593600,,994,4.3478260869565215

I read all the reviews before purchasing this story on video, and I agree that this short film is no blockbuster, but it is a good little genre film.

My advice is to read the whole story first and if you like it, get it on film* just for fun. Like trying to appreciate opera: it is better to learn the story so you fully understand what is going on.

*DVD might be a little sharper image than the video?",1262736000,,620,4.057377049180328
1256265,4,B00002VW85,"I first saw this film in 1972 as part of our survival training in the Royal Navy -  it had a profound affect on me and i never forgot its message - one mistake can kill you.  As a transfer from cine to digital it has lost some sound quality, but the message  is as strong as ever.  The orson Welles commentary keeps the story going.

1256269,5,B00002VW85,"I've developed a viewing guide for this film which combines the narration and a ""few"" excerpts from London's short story -- thus I've spent a great deal of time studying the film and London's original narrative.

What bothers me immensely about ""many"" Amazon reviewers of films are the ""observations"" or ""criticisms"" that the ""film versions"" don't measure up to original literary works.

Why should they?

These are ""film adaptation"" and the filmmaker seldom can ""match"" the creative essence of the original literary work.

Quite often the film adaptations are ""far superior"" to original literary works in creating significant and lasting literary experiences.

In the past fifty years or so, ""electronic literary experiences"" have become the primary medium for vicarious literary experiences.

In this case -- the film adaptation of London's ""To Build A Fire"" -- the filmmaker captures the ""essence"" of the story.  The film version is a classic -- especially well done considering that the film was produced and released 39 years ago, and was never intended to be a major theatrical release.

For you ""literature teachers"" try a controlled experiment with two groups - use ""only"" the film with the one group; while using ""only"" London's story with the other group.  Be sure the two groups are comparable -- then compare and contrast.  I dare you.

Also, try such a ""controlled"" experience with recalcitrant / reluctant students in ""both"" groups.  I dare you.

If no one ultimately reads London's story it will disappear, even from the internet.",1201996800,,1545,5.156626506024097

Specal footnote, author Jack London became the best-selling, highest paid and most popular American author of his time.""The Call of the Wild"" (1903) was his biggest success. ""The Sea-Wolf"" (1904) was turned into the first full-length American movie. Later came ""The Iron Heel""(1908), a premonition of the Orwellian world, and the autobiographical ""Martin Eden"" (1909). The highest-paid writer of his time, he earned over 2 million dollars, yet he was always broke. In 1905 he bought a ranch in California, where he designed the first concrete silo in the state. His books provided operating income. He once said: ""I would write a book for no other reason than to add three or four hundred acres to my magnificent estate."" His ecological approach and effort to adapt the ideas of Asian sustainable agriculture was ahead of his time. In 1913 his Big House was ruined by a devastating fire and Jack London was financially and mentally hurt. He built a small cottage and made big plans, but he lived only 3 more years. His 1400 acre ranch is now a National Historic Landmark, named Jack London State Historic Park. The writer's cottage was preserved by his wife Charmian, who lived there until her death in 1955...London was quoted: ""I would rather be ashes than dust! I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot. I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. The proper function of man is to live, not exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them, I shall use my time."" . . . . ""A bone to the dog is not charity. Charity is the bone shared with the dog, when you are just as hungry as the dog.""

1256272,3,B00002VW85,"This 56-minute film is, according to the video, 'Jack London's short story, narrated by Orson Wells and filmed with complete fidelity to London's graphic narrative' and 'could be called a screen short story in its purest form.'  It is certain that the film follows the original story faithfully, but the effects of watching the filmed story is not the same as the feeling you might get while reading this well-known story.

The events described are identical to those in London's original.  A man is travelling among the Alaskan wilderness with his dog.  As Orson Wells's solemn voiceover suggests, this man is perhaps unprepared for the climate.  At first, things look easy, but as his toes get numb because of the temperature and the traps the nature provided, to build a fire finally becomes a matter of life and death.

The original short story is, if I remember correctly, written from the viewpoint of the man.  The sentences are about how he feels, not how he looks.  The film, on the other hand, is about how he does look on screen, and the feelings of the traveller are explained by the acting (of the actor Ian Hogg) and the narration of Orson Wells (who, as you know, scared the people by his fake announcement about the killing Martians).  His narration is very good, but you might think, if we have his good narration, why should we watch the screen?  A taperecorder will do.

I don't have complaint about the film itself, but I still cannot understand why this film should be made.  Chilly experience and the struggle for survival are here, to be true, but you must read Jack London's story (before or after watching the film) to really start to care the severe situations of this traveller.  Otherwise, you might find it pretty dull to see a middle-aged man slowly, very slowly frozen.

The film is like reading a Cliff Note; you understand what happens in the tale, but it remains true that you don't feel anything without actually reading the tale.  (By the way, does someone know anything about the film itself?  Some say it's made in 1969 while others not, and director's name on the jacket is David Cobham while the film is credited to another person at other places.  Did anyone see it in theater?)",1124064000,,2219,4.677835051546392
1256273,3,B00002VW85,"A man and his dog are walking along Henderson Creek in the high Yukon country.  It is winter, and winter in the Yukon can be unforgiving to a chechaquo, a newcomer to the land.  It's the man's first winter and he is walking on a day he should not.  The dog knows this, but the man is a newcomer. The temperature is colder than sixty-five degrees below zero.  Jack London's `To Build a Fire' is a classic tale of man against nature, London's harsh Yukon nature that was ruled by the law of club and fang. First published as a juvenile story in the magazine Youth's Companion in 1902, it was changed a bit for an adult audience and published in its final form in the Century Magazine in 1908. A little later it was anthologized in a slim volume of London short stories entitled `Lost Face' in 1910.

 TO BUILD A FIRE is a 56-minute episode from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 1981 mini-series `Jack London's Tales of the Klondike.'  Directed by David Cobham, narrated by Orson Welles and starring Ian Hogg as the man, it is a faithful adaptation.  Which, in this case, is a mixed blessing.  London wrote from inside his characters, and what happened - the action - almost always shared equal billing with the character's reaction to that action.  I mean, his masterpiece, The Call of the Wild, is written from a dog's point-of-view!  The challenge presented by works like Call of the Wild and To Build a Fire is to bring that inner voice to the surface.  This program met the challenge, with middling success, by having Welles read pertinent sentences from the story over the action.

 Remove the narration and you have an hour's worth of a man walking across the snow.  It doesn't look as cold as I've pictured it, although whoever did the make-up frosted up the man's beard right nicely.  The man and dog get along too well, too.  London's Man ruled by the club, his Dog challenged that rule with the fang, and neither party ever seemed particularly fond of the other.  There are scenes in TO BUILD A FIRE where the dog seems downright frisky and playful.  Nowhere in the program is this observation from London's story on display - ""On the other hand, there was no keen intimacy between the dog and the man. The one was the toil-slave of the other, and the only caresses it had ever received were the caresses of the whip-lash and of harsh and menacing throat-sounds that threatened the whip-lash. ""  I never thought I'd ever have occasion to offer this observation, but I think the husky Pepper was miscast.  This program needed a surly dog, and they got a Disney-cute one instead.  I haltingly recommend TO BUILD A FIRE.  It could have been much worse.  Do not under any circumstance, though, watch this before reading the story.  London's story in its entirety is readily available on the internet, and your first exposure to a story usually sets it in your mind.  If you watch this before reading the original you're likely to wonder what all the fuss is about.",1121990400,,2975,4.587121212121212
1256274,5,B00002VW85,"I was very impressed with this movie. After reading, and re-reading this wonderful Jack London short story for years, I just heard it was made into a movie and I placed an order to have it overnighted to me. I watched it as soon as FED-EX delivered it, and I was riveted to it from the beginning to the end. I loved hearing Orson Welles voice as he narrated the movie. The period dress and scenery was perfect, just as I had imagined it in my head all the years as I read the story. I watched it with my 14 year old son, and he loved it also. Those who have spent time in the wilderness and in the bitter cold as I have will identify with the movie. I give it a 5 out of 5, and I will rewatch it many times I am sure. I highly recommend !.",1108944000,,739,3.8684210526315788
1256275,1,B00002VW85,"""To Build a Fire"" was one of the most boring movies we've ever seen.  The movie was drawn out and could have been completed in fifteen minutes.  Throughout the movie, the man had a bitter and cocky attitude.  He was ungrateful to his only companion, his dog.  The dog could have helped him live longer with his nature-like instinct.  Although he built a couple of fires, they were not sufficient in temperatures that cold.  The dog could have shared its body heat with the man by lying on the man's feet after he fell into the water.  But the man's arrogance caused his own death in the end.  The dog found his way to camp with his instincts.  All and all, we give this ""flick"" two thumbs way down.",1107734400,,698,4.348837209302325
1256276,2,B00002VW85,"Building a fire under this movie would be beneficial to us all. It followed Jack London's ""To Build a Fire"" well, but showed a poor portrayl of someone in the Yukon. After reliezing the temperature was seventy-five degrees below zero, the man knew it was dangerous to be outside in such cold conditions. Falling through the frozen spring made him relieze taht he needed to build a fire as soon as possible or death would meet hi,. If the man would have paid more attention to his dog's instincts, he may have beateb the blistering weather and survived. All in all, the slow-moving pace made us want to throw the video into the fireplace!",1107043200,,637,4.5964912280701755
1256277,1,B00002VW85,"I recently read the story ""To Build A Fire,"" written by Jack London.  I found it to be interesting and eventful.  However, the movie, narrated, by Orson Wells was terrible.  It did not receive five stars in my opinion.  Many times a movie that is based on a book adds and subtracts scenes, in this movie some scenes would've been better left out.

 The story line consists of a man hiking the Yukon Trail with his dog, Pepper.  The man, who never is given a name, doesn't listen to the ""old timer"" often referred to, and decides to hike in seventy-five degrees below zero temperatures without a partner.  The man overcomes many difficulties along the trip, but doesn't survive do to the outstanding weather and his wet feet.

 The movie was uneventful.  Many times I found my mind wandering back to the story and reading it in my head instead of watching the film.  The excitement that can be read in 20 minutes isn't mean to be made into an hour movie.  The story has a wonderful plot with a lesson to be learned. However, I do not recommend this movie to anyone due to the monotonous nature of it.  Although, I give the story five stars and I hope you will take a few minutes to read it.",1106697600,,1189,4.36986301369863

  As an assignment for a Composition class, seven of my dearest classmates and I sat down to review the movie and we all agreed. Nothing beats ""To Build a Fire."" The movie tells the tale of a man (keenly resembling  Grizzly Adams) on his trip through the Yukon, on his way to camp at the Klondike gold strike.  It is a breathtaking tale indeed!  We were shocked upon finding that neither Ian Hoggs (who plays the Grizzly Adamsesque traveler) nor the dog (who plays... the dog) won oscars or any other awards; the Academy sure missed the boat on this one!  Ian Hoggs is a master of his craft, and not just anyone can pull off the Grizzly Adams look!

1256279,3,B00002VW85,"The story ""To Build a Fire"" was very intersting but the movie fell short. Costuming, scenery and special effect were all miserable. The sotry depicts a man who had a strong bond with his dog and is very knowledgeable with it comes to traveling. In the story we could picture how cold it was by the color of his amber beard from his tobacco chew and the darkness.  The movie did not depict the amber beard and the darkness.

The movie left many of these elements out.  Until the very end of the movie when his face frosted over it seemed like he was just a man walking on a normal winter day, but iwth arrogance and stupidity.",1106265600,,625,4.279661016949152

The story itself is a real tear-jerker, and I would definately consider this one of the saddest movies I've ever watched. A man is hiking through a Yukon trail in -75 weather, with a dog.  He decides to build a fire, but then it goes out.  When he tries to build another one, his fingers are frozen and he can't, so he dies a slow and agonizingly cold death.  I had a lump in my throat!

1256282,4,B00002VW85,"This ""To Build a Fire"" video can stand up to the short story. In its genre, it is just as effective. Of course, it helps to have the narration of Orson Wells! There are times when the accordian-music background can be distracting, but then again, I suppose it connotes the era of gold-prospecting in the Yukon. I am a high school English teacher who has shown this video for years as a companion piece after reading the classic tale by London, and just the other day, one of my sharp-eyed students exclaimed that he had noticed a man in the background just as the main character stumbles to his death at the video's end.
