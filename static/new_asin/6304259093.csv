815876,1,6304259093,I'm familiar with the film and have enjoyed it. I was very disappointed with the audio on this transfer. While the video seemed blu-ray quality I was surprised to find the only audio option was a stereo track. I went back and checked the listing and there is no mention of the audio options or quality. I had assumed it was Dolby Hd but unfortunately not. I would avoid.,1488326400,,370,4.3768115942028984

815884,5,6304259093,"Obviously, this is not the original ""The Crow"" movie with Brandon Lee. Yet, I found this film absolutely beautiful, but and here comes the but...if you're one of those fans who are closed-minded who only like ""The Crow"" because of Brandon Lee, then this sequel will not be given the chance it rightly deserves. Those who know me, know I adore Brandon Lee and I have painted a few portraits in his honor, with that said...please give this movie a chance. To me this movie is just as good as the original. Vincent Perez did an awesome job portraying an individual who faces a loss in his life that was traumatic. I loved how the character of Sarah kicked butt and I believe all actors, actresses and producers did a wonderful job! I actually watched it 3 times and I did not tire from watching it.

The storyline is great; avenging his son's death rather than his girlfriend is deep. Sarah is gorgeous and I enjoyed her dark sense of style. Vincent Perez is awesome and I could see has a passion for acting, I never once found him be any less. I am glad they made the choice to play Ashe.

There are some very beautiful quotes in the film too.

There really is nothing wrong with this film. I don't have the slightest clue why people hate it.

Stop criticising this movie! The Characters are different, The actors are different, the villains are different and technically the story is different, for in the first movie, It's Eric Draven's Fiance that gets murdered and the ""sequel"", It's Ashe's SON that get's murdered.

O.K. maybe i'm wrong, it more likely is a sequel. But it's not a sequel to the first crow film, it does not follow the same story, it's about a completely different person.

The message I'm trying to get through to you is: ""Stop thinking of it as a sequel. Think of it as it's own movie, THEN you'll enjoy it better."" Just give the damn movie a chance.",1455753600,2,1871,4.456140350877193

816111,1,6304259093,"Originally, City of Angels was going to be very different from the original Crow, partly to make it unique (darker and more gothic) and partly out of respect for Brandon Lee. Unfortunately, the producers' vision was rejected by the studio, and instead we get a re-edited mess which feels almost entirely like a cheapened rehash of the first film. The vast majority of scenes are copied from the first movie, but without a semblance of continuity or a sense of who these people really are (worst is Ashe himself, who outside of the obvious is not well defined and slips into and out of a Spanish accent for some reason). While the movie starts off with some promise, it gets more and more ridiculous until the final confrontation (which is a lot like the first Blade in its awful conclusion). I should also say this: There's a difference between being naturally ""cool"" and trying too hard, and in this effort it's far too obviously the latter.",1424908800,,942,4.680722891566265

Wicked Prayer however is so bad that Edward Norton starred in it.. since we can generally judge the caliber of the films he has been in after American History X by how overweight he is, it seems this one is around a 2 on that alone. The movie is unwatchable. The transfer of both seem very close to the dvd and there is allot of artifact and fallout.. oh and the sound is crap.

But thats ok.. because you cannot watch the second film anyway without feeling sorry for everyone involved and being glad that they have put the series out of its misery (so far) after that film.. and the City Of Angels is a little better in these ways.",1395360000,,747,4.297872340425532

816417,2,6304259093,"It would be a challenge to defend any of the sequels to one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm not gonna say it's an outright terrible movie because it's not. It's entertaining, the characters are decent. But it's just a rehash of the first one, too many scenes that reminded me of the original. I get the concept of the crow and what it's about but when you do a sequel that's this close in years to the original you have to bring something relatively new to the table. It's a new setting, okay fine, but it just feels like you've been there done that. The Crow is one of those movies that should be a one and done type of thing. It never should've had all these pointless sequels. The reason the original worked so well was because it was done in a unique gothic style but also there was a lot of emotion and beauty in it. Yes there is a lot of weird comic book stuff going on and it was very violent and dark and murky but that's also part of it's charm.

City of Angels just feels dirty and wrong. Let's forget for a moment that Brandon Lee died during filming and just look at the original work as it was intended to be viewed. It's clear that there was a great deal of passion and emotion put into it. Several scenes in the original still get me choked up or on the edge of my seat with excitement. City of Angels never even approachs that. It's just a fun, forgettable watch that doesn't grab me like the first one did. But it's clear that it was never meant to be as captivating as the original, which begs me to ask the question, what's the point?",1391731200,,1560,4.148514851485149

816421,5,6304259093,"The Crow: City of Angels is really a 4 star rating not a 5 but I am giving it that because the customer reviews were weak. I love the first Crow, It was a very dark adaptation of the comic which featured awesome acting and great action, and gory kills. The Crow: City of Angels was dismissed as a cash in right off the bat when it was announced, People thought it was a disgrace to the late Brandon Lee(R.I.P) which is understandable but City of Angels really is a good film. I have not seen The Crow: Salvation or The Crow: Wicked Prayer yet but I especially heard Wicked Prayer is the worst of the series.

Plot: Ashe Corven(Vincent Perez) and his Son as they witness a gang murder a guy, The gang then kills Ashe and his son and Ashe gets resurrected by a crow and becomes The Crow to get revenge on the gang that killed him and his son. Sounds almost like the first one and the plot is near the first one but it is not the same. Iggy Pop gives a good performance as one of the gang members as well as a young Thomas Jane. Vincent Perez is good as well but of course not better than the great Brandon Lee. Mia Kirshner plays a older Sarah in the film and does a good job.

DVD: Warning, Get the Collector Series DVD if you plan on buying City of Angels, Do not get the Miramax DVD released a couple of years ago or the Blu-Ray put out a couple years ago because the picture quality on the Collector Series DVD is better and it has a ton of features, The recent Miramax releases have no features.

Overall: If you do not compare City of Angels to the first one, You may enjoy it. I love this film and I know I am in the minority of that but if you go into it with an open mind, I think you will appreciate being its own film.",1386374400,,1727,4.029154518950437

816533,2,6304259093,"Coming off the original Crow film, a cult classic in which its star Brandon Lee died in a tragic on-set accident, The Crow: City of Angels had its work cut out for it. Where do you go from there?

The Crow: City of Angels (not to be confused with the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan drama City of Angels that was released a couple years later) takes the Crow story out of the darkly stylized pseudo-Detroit to a smoggy stylized pseudo-Los Angeles. Taking place at least 10 years after the original film, an adult Sarah (this time played by Mia Kirschner) has moved to L.A. and become a tattoo artist, but is plagued by dreams of the second arrival of The Crow.

But instead of Eric Draven, we get Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez), a mechanic who is resurrected from the dead with the gift of invulnerability after being killed alongside his young son by a gang headed by the local druglord Judah Earl (Richard Brooks). Judah's gang is comprised of Spider Monkey (Vincent Castellanos), Nemo (a young Thomas Jane), Kali (Thuy Trang of Power Rangers fame), and Curve (rockstar Iggy Pop). Ashe sets out to take murderous vengeance against the gang, hunting them down one by one, hoping he'll be reunited with his son's spirit in the afterlife when he's finished. But things become complicated when Ashe and Sarah fall in love, and Judah discovers Ashe's one weakness.

So first, the good things about the film: the production design. The film looks great. This polluted, smog-covered L.A. seems like its constantly cast in an jaundiced light, like the whole city is dying of liver failure from all the drugs and decadence its denizens feed itself. Its walls are covered in graffitti, its streets are littered with trash, and any sane person with enough sense would've left for another city long ago (I wonder what a Crow-ized pseudo Seattle or San Francisco would look like, but they're probably just as corrupt and polluted). The first film used Halloween and the night before, Devil's Night, as a backdrop for Eric Draven's story. But this film uses the Day of the Dead (Dio de los Muertos) in a similar way, as both celebrations share similarities. And the film make Day of the Dead look like a pretty cool party that should be observed more often outside of Mexico and L.A.

But aside from those bright spots, the film is just not very good. Unfortunately, with a story like The Crow, you often have to follow the same story beats, making the film feel derivative and uninspired. Man gets killed, a loved one is also killed in the process, man returns from the dead, man hunts down and kills his murderers one by one. Lather, rinse, repeat with each sequel. Don't believe me? Also check out The Crow: Salvation. I haven't seen The Crow: Wicked Prayer, but I'm probably not going out on a limb and assuming it's no different. But how else would movie producers attempt to recapture the success of the first film without its star? By rehashing the same story over, and over, and over, and over. This film does attempt a more melancholy tone, but it results in a film feels more slow and plodding. The film's finale feels as butchered as it actually is. The original ending forced Ashe to choose between Sarah and his son, and it's a decision that ultimately leaves him without both of them in the end. However, studio interference led to cuts that removed that choice from the plot, leaving the film with a sense of stiltedness and unresolved ambiguity.

City of Angels' script doesn't fare much better. Written by David Goyer (yes, of The Dark Knight Trilogy), the dialogue is somber and vaguely spiritual at times, repetitive at others. Ashe often repeats the last things each gang member said to him before they killed him. It's meant to be ironic, but it becomes stale and predictable really fast.

Vincent Perez is miscast as Ashe. Half the time, his dialogue is barely intelligible underneath his thick accent. And I can't even tell what kind of accent it is. Is it French? Is it Italian? Is it Spanish? Where is Ashe supposed to be from? Whatever the case, you can't make out what he's saying. And as for his acting...well, yeah. He doesn't feel very menacing, and he has baffling moments of overacting that are downright comical. There is a scene where he trashes his garage amidst flashbacks of his son, and all it amounts to is a lot of yelling, kicking shelves, and knocking things down. I've seen just about the same amount of genuine emotion in Tommy Wiseau's attempts at angst in The Room, and I can't help but chuckle now.

The rest of the cast fills out their parts no better, aside from Iggy Pop. At least Curve comes off sufficiently creepy. Richard Brooks' line delivery feels more like he's reading from a children's book instead of a script. Mia Kirschner's Sarah just doesn't seem to have much of a personality aside from being mopey and doe-eyed. Thuy Trang doesn't even seem like she can handle the film's violent content. It's like she's holding back, and not out of an actor's artistic restraint but because she really doesn't wanna be there.

The film's music is decent if not very memorable. There's an ethereal orchestral score, but no particular theme that feels iconic. The film uses the occasional source music, with songs from the likes of Hole, PJ Harvey, Filter, and yes, an Iggy Pop song made the cut. Rock band The Deftones makes an appearance at the Day of the Dead celebration. This film tries to present us with a soundtrack to match the first film's impressive music, but like most of the film as a whole, it too falls short of those lofty ambitions.

And that's ultimately what this film is, an attempt to capture the first film's success but a disappointing failure that makes you kinda wish they didn't try.",1384214400,,5734,4.680555555555555

first time this is the version of the 2nd and 4th you need.  Unfortunately of this writing only the first 'The Crow' is out on Blu-Ray and the third 'The Crow Salvation' is only available on DVD (again I've no idea why but make sure you get the Dimension Collector's Series edition of it!).

The film is absolutely beautiful, but if you're one of those closed-minded fans who only like The Crow because of Brandon Lee, you will never give this sequel a chance to prove that it could be just as good as the original.

The storyline is a good one. Avenging your son's death rather than your girlfriend's is a lot more deep. Sarah is gorgeous and has a dark sense of style. Vincent Perez was also a fine choice to play Ashe.

There are some very beautiful quotes in the film too.

There really is nothing wrong with this film. I don't have the slightest clue why people hate it.

Stop criticising this movie! The Characters are different, The actors are different, the villains are different and technically the story is different, for in the first movie, It's Eric Draven's Fiance that gets murdered and the ""sequel"", It's Ashe's SON that get's murdered.

O.K. maybe i'm wrong, it more likely is a sequel. But it's not a sequel to the first crow film, it does not follow the same story, it's about a completely different person.

The message I'm trying to get through to you is: ""Stop thinking of it as a sequel. Think of it as it's own movie, THEN you'll enjoy it better."" Just give the damn movie a chance.",1376006400,5,1280,4.425531914893617
816540,3,6304259093,"Note: I saw this film via XFinity On Demand.

The sequel to The Crow starring the late Brandon Lee was originally envisioned as a different film by writer David S. Goyer (who has since gone on to greater fame as the writer/co-screenwriter of BATMAN BEGINS & co-story writer of THE DARK KNIGHT, and now co-story writer/screenwriter of MAN OF STEEL) and director Tim Pope. I hope that the Director's Cut is released on DVD someday, so we can see what their vision for the film was, before Miramax decided to re-edit it in order to make it similar to the first movie.

As released, though, The Crow: City Of Angels is a sub-par sequel. Worth seeing only once. Vincent Perez did a good job as Ashe (his French accent and sinistrous voice were perfect for this film) and Mia Kirshner was under-used as Sarah. I wish there had been more than just a brief passing reference to Eric and Shelly. Thuy Trang was also under-used as Kali. And what was the point of Sarah befriending the little girl if the girl was going to remain on the streets?

The only thing I didn't like was the profaning of God'a Name (ie. combining the Name of God with a mild profanity).

816630,5,6304259093,"I'm a long-time fan of this film but I won't go off and say that I don't understand why people trash it. Like any film, The Crow: City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not, the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original, chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place, a different man, and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now, the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them.

 First off, there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. However, unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer: They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple, watered down versions of this story. In The Crow: City of Angels, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying.

 Ashe resurrects and seeks out his vengeance with the help of Sarah who is having psychic dreams about Ashe and his murder. Sarah (Mia Kirshner) may not seem interesting to some but she is completely enamored with Ashe. The taboo of the living making love to the dead was cut out of the film (amongst many other things) and never pursued in the ""director's cut"" or the cut you'll see on Netflix. I wish the studio didn't cut that out of the film. Still, you get the feeling that these two are passionate about each other.

 The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a pre-punisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo, the energetic and comical bad guy, Spider-monkey, Iggy Pop as Curve, along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge, Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you, Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as T-bird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film, you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve (Iggy Pop). Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected.

 I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crow-like movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut of the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor, I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them.

 What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography, lighting, coloration, production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized, strikingly visual, and mesmerizing. It just sucks that no matter which version you see you're seeing a murdered film. So much was cut out of it that made important elements make sense. The director, Tim Pope, who was most known for directing music videos was not allowed by the studio to realize his vision of this film full form. The ""director's cut"" is not the actual director's cut (from what I've read) but that's the cut I suggest you see if you're ever going to take the chance. You will not find that cut on Netflix which is the severely butchered version of an already butchered film.

 My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion. Like I said, The Crow City of Angels wasn't for everyone. Take it or leave it as you please but I'm not afraid to say this has always been one of my favorite films.",1362009600,21,5891,4.429362880886426

816771,1,6304259093,"Hi, I just want to say first off I love this movie ""The Crow:City of Angels"". This film is actually one of my favorites, and I'm one of only a few people who likes it just as much as the original Crow film.  So that being said your probably wondering if I love this movie so much why did I give it only one crappy star.  I gave it one star because this Blu-Ray was produced by the company Echo Bridge, which is known for releasing some of the worst quality Blu-Rays ever seen. Let me now explain why this Blu-Ray is so bad.  First off the Blu-Rays main menu is terrible, the menu itself has only two tabs, a very slow acting, poorly coded scene selection sub-menu, and a play button to start the film.  Secondly the information on the back of the Blu-Ray case of ""The Crow: City of Angels"" tells us that we're in store for a 1080p, 1.78:1 (from 1.85:1) framed visual tour de force. Only Instead, the AVC MPEG-4 encode is rockin' the i. As in 1080i, which is lesser quality than 1080p. Thirdly The film has a noticeable haze in a number of sequences, which often runs slightly orange.  From viewing every available resource (including samples from the regular Crow:City of Angles DVD itself, as well as online youtube trailers), there appears to be an upped, overly heated aspect to this release. Skin tones just never feel right, contrast levels are always ""off,"" unusual. Yes, the haze can obscure detail, but when the haze itself is obscured in its detail, as the video is often soft, we are left with obscured softness. It's not pretty, not one bit. There is an overall lack of fine detail damn near anywhere, as even closeups are less than impressive or sharp. There are less than a handful of actual sharp moments, and they are usually just quick flashes, like when the Ashe runs away from Sarah's dwelling, brief little moments that are hardly satisfactory!!  It's like some complete amateur was messing with the films hue/saturation and sharpness levels. If you like watching Blu-rays that have quality that goes soft, dull, soft, average, dull, soft, sharp for five seconds, dull, duller, worse than DVD, borderline VHS, dull, dull, dull!!! Then hey, Echo Bridge's Blu-Ray release of 'The Crow: City of Angels' is right up your alley! In conclusion this Echo Bridge Release of ""The Crow: City Of Angels"" is one of the worst Blu-Rays of all time.  I've seen old cheesy 1950's Sci-Fi films get better transfers/conversions to Blue-Ray. Skip the Blu-Ray version of this film and get ""The Crow - City of Angels (Collector's Series) DVD"" which was from 2001!!!!",1337040000,2,2564,4.6467991169977925

The Crow: City Of Angels

What I liked about the movie:
1. The coloring of the movie made it very dark and brooding!
2. The criminals in this movie really deserved to be punished!
3. The basic plot was good!
4. The soundtrack was (for the most part) good but not great!
5. Most of the actors tried to do a good job with their parts!
6. The end of the movie had a nice twist to it!
7. The part after the crow kills the character Spider monkey (they play
White Zombie's I'm Your Boogieman) he walks out of the fire! That was my favorite
party of the entire movie!

What I didn't like:
1. The pace was too slow!
2. The plot didn't hold the movie up enough!
3. Vincent Perez was not the best choice for the crow!
4. Mia was not the best choice for a young adult Sarah!
5. They went a little over-board with the drugs!
6. Why is the cocaine black?
7. They were showing the same flashback sequences too many times!
8. There was too much whispering!

Bottom line: They pretty much too the first crow movie's basic ideas and ruined most of them!
My grade: C or two stars!

The Crow: Wicked Prayer

Bad, bad, bad movie!
What I liked:
1. The cast was great!
2. The lighting was good!

What I didn't like:
1. The dialog made no sence!
2. The plot made no sence!

Bottom line: I did not understand anything in this movie! It was bad! I know it was a B-movie, but still The Crow: Salvation was a B-movie but you could still understand what was going on in the movie! Even The Crow: City Of Angels had heart too it! So avoid this piece of crap, hopefully the next one will be better!
One can hope...!

Overall: The Crow: City Of Angels was weird but still watchable! But avoid The Crow: Wicked Prayer!

816857,4,6304259093,"This film, in my personal opinion, was beautiful. I love The Crow more than The Crow: City of Angels, but this film still was a really good watch.

Let me preface this with: I haven't read the comics - I just love the first two movies in The Crow series (everything after, no thanks). I'm not sure how much the movies strayed from the actual comics, but that's really not my concern - so I don't care :P

Anyway, what we watch on this DVD - what we watched in theaters - what we watch on TV - is NOT the movie in its entirety. So much was cut out of the original script - key moments, scenes, actions, lines that tie the story together. Without these, it made the final product pretty confusing and seeming like there's something missing - because there is.

I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned this in the reviews on here yet - I didn't have time to read through them all - I recommend Googling: The Crow: City of Angels Second Coming. There's a Web site that explains everything and there's even a fan-edited version of the film tying the missing pieces into the movie. The scenes were either shot and cut or were never shot at all - so the actual theatrical scenes aren't in the fan-edit of the film, but the storyline itself is. Check it out and see if it changes your opinion of the movie :)",1315180800,,1297,4.242914979757085

The ending is a bit of a let down in my opinion, however still a great flick which I am happy to have in my collection.

The PQ and AQ are nothing amazing however the PQ was much better than I expected based off of some of the reviews I had been hearing. I was quite impressed with the clarity of such a low budget older film. The detail isn't enough to blow you away, however there are some great closeups of the characters faces which look great.

Video: The picture quality is a significant improvement over the latest DVD release. While far from perfect, it is crisper and the colors are more vibrant. This release also preserves the original theatrical aspect ratio opposed to the DVD release which is 1.85:1. Film imperfections are still visible and some scenes are grainy.

Audio: English 2.0. No subs. Disappointing.

Special Features: There was a considerable lack of effort put into this release. It is barebones with a below average interactive menu.

Crow: TCOA Thinking it would be a Glimpse of All the Great Things to Come from out of the Dimension/Miramax
Vault.......
Little did I know That The Studio went the cheap route and got in bed with a Secondary Company (Echo Bridge Home Entertainment)
Who's Track record with HD Transfers is not at all HQ  (Echo Bridge Home Entertainment) Should be doing work for low Budget Indie Films, High schools & Colleges
Why would Miramax put there Name on such a Poor Quality Product???

Maybe they should hook-up with Anchor Bay

I guess I'll stick it out and just wait for the 4 BR's I pre-Ordered to come But, maybe just hold on to the SD Dvd Versions too!

In the future I doubt I'll be buying to Many BR from Dimension/Miramax Until they wake up
And Respect the Consumers and put out HQ HD Products

As far as the Film
The Crow: TCOA is a very Good follow up to the Original (By far the Only Stand-out sequel) The Rest are Dreadful and barely watchable

COA in some ways wasn't given much of a Chance
It's hard to try to replicate the Original Crow
But, as long as you keep a opened mind The Film stands on it's own

Vincent Perez was a extremely good choice as  Ash
The Character is different then Eric Draven but, at the same time you see a slight mirror image

Mia Kirshner as The Adult Sarah  (Bridges the Gap between Both Films and helps the flow of the story)
-To this day Mia in hands down one of the most under-rated actresses she flies under the radar. Which is such a shame!
The villains are hit and miss
mostly cause some of them are bad Clones from The Original

Iggy Pop (Curve) , Thomas Jane (Nemo) & Vincent Castellanos  (Spider Monkey)  are Great Solid Bad Guys (Despite the other Actor's)
If any of these guys were Not in City of Angels it would suck!
You need a few good Stand out Actors to make the Film work

The Soundtrack much like the Original Crow is also a Huge Character that is very good

If you love the Original Crow and only avoided City Of Angels 'Cause you felt it was either too soon or you could never makes a better Adaption then the Original
You need to Check it out!
it's  very good & enjoyable and deserves Respect
Cause the 1st sequel could have been Garbage  (Just Avoid Salvation &  Wicked Prayer Those 2 were put out just for the sake of quick cash and using The CROW copyright license  poorly)

I give the film itself high marks The BR is yet to be seen
  8/10
the disc is missing the bonus music videos/promo videos by filter and hole

816997,1,6304259093,"As a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and the general practice of mocking bad films I can honestly say that there was no redeeming value in `The Crow: City of Angels.'  The film is just downright sloppy, and very unnecessary given the plot of the first film and how it didn't warrant a sequel in ANY way, but you know Hollywood: if one film makes a profit they need to try and repeat that film's formula and cash in again.

This movie was a low-budget film, roughly $18 million in total cost, which doesn't say anything about the quality, because Alex Proyas, with a simple $15 million managed to make the first film- one of the most visually captivating comic-based films of all time.  But what the disadvantage this film does have is that director Tim Pope has nowhere near the talent of Proyas.  In fact, 95% of this film's visual style is a carbon copy of the original film, only now most of the city is lit by bright, YELLOW lights, and it happens to be situated beside the ocean.  Other than this the style of this film is a rip-off and being a rip-off fails to captivate the mind of the audience in the same way as the first film.

Not to rip on Vincent Perez, but his performance as the new Crow was downright despicable- a pale, heartless imitation of Brandon Lee's critically acclaimed character in the first film.  This is probably more the fault of the director and scriptwriters, but regardless, this comes across more as a perversion of Brandon Lee than of a new character picking up the mantle of the Gothic anti-hero.

The script is one of the cheesiest you'll ever see.  There is literally a point where the villain kills and drinks the blood of the crow and then gets the strength of the Crow.  This makes absolutely no sense and in no way reflects ANY of the mythos in either the first film or the comic series.

The Crow is just too simple of a story to be made into an effective franchise because the formula runs like so: guy and loved one are brutally murdered, guy kills dudes who murdered him and said loved one, leaving a crow emblem at the crime scene, then when he's done he dies and joins loved one in afterlife.  This is all The Crow is.  It was good for one movie, but it just cannot be turned into a franchise.

Keep in mind, I was half asleep when this movie was on TV, and even then -the time of day when I'm most acceptable of bad movies- I still managed to hate this movie with a passion, and not because I was a fan of the original, or because I had read bad buzz surrounding the movie (I hadn't even HEARD of it before that fateful night- and for good reason!) , but because I honestly, and truly could not stand ANY aspect of this film.

If you enjoyed the first film and the James O'Barr comic book, don't do as I did: do the smart thing.  Avoid `The Crow: City of Angels' with every ounce of your being.",1246838400,,2848,4.295327102803738
817096,3,6304259093,"As a fan of Eric Proyas ""The Crow"" (1994) and James O'Barr's graphic novel I was somewhat hesitant to view the follow-up, especially since it received such poor reviews. I didn't want my enjoyment of the first film to be tarnished by a mediocre sequel, but I figured, ""what the heck"" and went ahead and rented it. While at first I considered Tim Pope's ""The Crow: City of Angels"" (1996) to be a huge disappointment, especially when one compares it to the original, in all honesty, it's not that bad of a film and it has its redeeming qualities.

The cinematography is somewhat of a mixed-bag. While the original film was dark and bleak, it was done with elegance and style, ""City of Angels,"" by contrast with its intrusive soundtrack and heavy-handed glumness, can come across as cartoonish--like a B horror movie or a Marilyn Manson/Rob Zombie video. Still, the post-apocalyptic vision of the future with its barren, hopeless, filthy  landscape is captivating.

While the plot is essentially just a rehash of the first movie, except a father/son are the murdered victims instead of a couple, the father's devotion is touching.  The gang of bad guys (with the exception of Iggy Pop) are mostly mostly faceless, although the chief bad guy, (some bald dude) with his narcissistic, psychopathic personality is kind of interesting.  The ending is somewhat confusing and disappointing, with the main villain  taking away all of the Crow's power only to be overtaken by a flock of crows? Huh? Although the last scene, with the Crow and his son going to ""a better place"" is good way to conclude the film.

As for the character of the Crow himself , while Brandon Lee's character was funny, savage and human, Vincent Perez (as Ash) in this film comes across as a soap opera actor, a good lucking guy with a wooden delivery going through the motions. Mia Kirshner, the Crow's love interest, serves no real purpose to the storyline and her death at the end is entirely pointless to the narrative.

""City of Angles"" best character is Iggy Pop, as the vile thug ""Curve"" and is easily as good as ""Tin Tin"" or ""Funboy"" from the original movie. I also enjoyed the scenes of the Crow (the actual bird, not Perez) in flight--some very cool cinematography there.

A commercial and critical failure, ""The Crow: City of Angels"" pretty much torpedoed the Crow franchise, with next few movies going straight-to-video. Still, this film isn't bad and while obviously not the original, is worth renting if you liked the fist movie.",1239494400,,2506,4.809302325581395

817098,1,6304259093,"More of a remake than a sequel, ""The Crow: City Of Angels"" attempts to capitalize on the cult phenomenon of it's predecessor by basically repeating and rehashing it's basic premise without actually adding anything new or of merit. This time around, instead of Detroit, it's a decaying Los Angeles -- populated by set-pieces that look like they could be destroyed by a stiff breeze -- and Vincent Perez is summoned from the dead to avenge the death of his son and himself at the hands of a gang, with the help of Sarah (Mia Kirshner), who may or may not be the same Sarah from the first movie. Music video director Tim Pope, who hasn't done anything worthwhile since, gives this film a definite mid-90's look. Truth be told, not only does the movie look low-budget and meant for direct-to-video release, but also looks like something you would catch on HBO at three in the morning during a weekday. As hard as the script tries -- which, come to think of it, it doesn't -- it just can't match the potency of the original. Instead of getting to know our main characters and building the required backstory with the tragic elements needed, the exposition is handled in such a careless way. It seems like they wanted to get the story out of the way so they could get straight to the violence. A father avenging the murder of his own child? Should have had a little more emotional impact than what was actually presented in the movie. The actors all pretty much ham it up, although punk icon Iggy Pop manages to keep the audience from falling asleep, while his co-star, Thuy ""Yellow Ranger"" Trang, is at the very least, an interesting presence in a movie such as this. On all accounts, ""The Crow: City Of Angels"" is and was a complete and utter failure, dooming the rest of the franchise into direct-to-video Hell.

817100,3,6304259093,"Seeing The Crow flash across the screen again was something I wasn't sure I'd be able to experience again after the tragic misfortunes of the first Crow movie.  I've heard it said that one of the crew members on the first movie actually thought it was cursed.

But this second movie, which is based around a new Crow (Vincent Perez) and the returning Sarah from the first movie (played in this one by the beautiful and dark Mia Kirshner) wasn't cursed like the first one, the curse this had was that it was a sequel to something that likely didn't need one.  Although I enjoyed the dark circumstances that surrounded the actual onscreen play, with the nod to ""La Dia De los Muertos"" (The Day Of The Dead) being my favorite, the story about a murdered father who returns to avenge his son, to me, takes away from the romantic overtones of the first movie and the Crow comic book overall.

The original story was written by James O'Barr to help him exorcize the demons he lived with after losing his first love early in life and he's made mention that in truth, the Crows story was told then, and in his eyes had been told completely.  But as with all things we find interesting or fall in love with, it was decided that there needed to be more, so they made more.

I kind of doubt Brandon Lee would have come back for the sequel if he'd lived as I'm sure he would have felt, as O'Barr did, that Eric Dravens story had been told.  I make a few leaps here, making mention of things James has said to me and maybe a little of what I hope Brandon Lee would have done had he survived the accident that took his life, but I make them with the best intentions.

I enjoyed the movie, being a comic book geek, I was sure I would.  I have to admit to having felt a little betrayed when the sequel came out, just as I was when the ensuing comic follow-ups came out, but the Crow has become an avenger of wrongs that couldn't be put right any other way, a dark hero to the masses who suffer and have no way to let that out other than to dream of a hero who would go beyond death to right their wrongs and although Eric and Shelleys story was told to completion, there are more stories to tell.  This is one of them.  There are others, there will be others, likely as many as there are people with stories of their own, because truly, who among us doesn't feel the need at some point in our lives to be avenged?

See the movie, be forewarned that it contains violence in the extreme, some nudity and a lot of what might be termed ""the darker aspects of life"", drugs, gangs, betrayels, S&M and torture.  Iggy Pop, though not great either, was a welcome touch of dark realism to the play on the screen.  If you go in with no expectations based on the first movie or the comic book, this 3 stars quickly becomes 3 1/2 or 4.",1164499200,,2806,4.220560747663551
817101,5,6304259093,"The terrible mistake most viewers make when watching a Crow movie or a reading another Crow Novel or Comic is that they compare the ""Crow"" in question to the previous Crow or Crows. You have to understand that this character isn't ""Eric"" (Crow from the first film), This isn't Motor City Detroit, This is The City Of Angels and the main characters name is Ashe this is his life, his perspective. Its not supposed to be like the first Crow they are two different people and two different stories, thats all they are just stories, they are not sequels or prequels just installments. If you could see everyones life before your eyes would they look the same? No they wouldn't. Why? Because were all different. All the folks who gave this movie bad reviews did so because they are standing to close to a big picture, step back and see the big picture. The world and the ways of the Crow aren't so narrow that they would stay limited to the confines and brooding post-gothic nature of the first film.

Most of the people giving reviews probably don't even know that James O' Barr wrote the first Crow after losing the love of his life to a drunk driver, so all that pain, frustration, and hatred went into those pages and script. You can't create pain like that you have to know it. This is why the first Crow has an unfair advantage against all the new Crow movies, you can't turn water into wine, these directors had to work it in the best way they could.

By giving such harsh critique to these movies you may alter someones judgement and cause them to miss out on a really good film. Crow:City Of Angels was a good movie and a good Crow story. I myself loved the first film the most, I even remember the trailers that played ""Big Empty"" By Stone Temple Pilots which I still listen to today.

There's a problem, though: it was really bad.

The problem, as I recall, is that we know nothing about Ashe Crowe (wow. what an original last name for this movie.): he's just some unbelievably nice father who (lives?) in a garage shop with his son, Danny.  Till guess what?  A bunch of drug-using, scummy semi-gangsters come and ruin his, uh, idyllic life by murdering his son and then him.  Vincent Perez is nowhere near Brandon Lee's level of talent as an actor, and Lee himself was no Olivier.

But Iggy Pop!  He's perfect as the badass scumbag (""nothing personal, sport..."") who puts the final shot in Perez's character on the docks.  He's so good that it's almost like he's not acting.  The best scene in this movie is when Crowe, after blasting Pop's character to nearly nothing, places two coins in his eyes and sends him floating on the scummy city river: heavy handed symbolism, yes, very striking, yes as well.

Otherwise, it sucked and strikes no comparison to the Gothic, almost believable majesty of the original.  I remember reading James O'Barr saying that he wanted nothing to do with the film before it came out and did not want his name in the credits.  Good move on his part.

The very first Crow movie is of course, the BEST.

And when I first saw City Of Angels, I was doing what everybody was and comparing it to the first with Brandon Lee.

But really, this movie is actually pretty cool in its own respect.

The visuals were great, color toned this time which is a nice variety to the first film which was more blue and bleak (which was excellent). Vincent Perez was actually not bad as the new Crow and since he's not supposed to be Eric Draven (Brandon Lee)

I can totally forgive the fact the he doesnt carry the original's trademarked personality.

MIA KIRSHNER IS BEAUTIFUL!!!!!

She plays a good roll of the now grown up version of Sarah from the first movie.

Iggy Pop is awesome and though hes no actor, he definitely plays the sleezeball a$$h@le very very well.

Judah Earl is an ok villain but not much in comparison to Top Dollar from the first film. He's not as charismatic nor really tells anything about his origin.

The horrible tragedy is good enough to push viewers with the Crow to have his revenge on the bad guys.

The ending of the movie is pretty good, but Id have made it a little more dramatic to contrast the harshness of the film.

Ashe comes back to avenge his and his sn's death. He's helped by Sarah, who i think is supposed to be the orginal Sarah from the orginal movie. Eventually, Ashe goes up against Judah, the very odd drug lord.

What i liked: Well..not a lot honestly. The look was pretty cool, and the first part had me watching. Sybil, the blind girl, was interesting. And i liked the moments with the little girl, Grace. I was glad to see Sarah was in this.

What i didn't like: the story just didn't grab me after a while. to be honest, it seemed like the screenplay writer was a bit confused as to what to do between Ashe and Sarah. you could tell had Ashe not be doomed to go back to the dead, there might have been a relationship. But that just wouldn't have fit. The bad guys were pathetic, except for Kali, she was pretty good. Even Judah. It seemed they tried to make him almost godlike, and that dosn't work very well.

Unable to make a successful escape, Ashe and Danny are captured and taken to the the harbor where they are killed and thrown into the ocean.

Meanwhile a beautiful young goth named Sarah (Mia Kirshner) is tormented by a series of bad dreams and is unable to sleep. A highly sensitive and intuitive tattoo artist and painter, she is familiar with the world of spirits and the ongoing legacy of 'The Crow.' Somehow she knows another Crow is on the way.

And so it all begins again. A new 'Crow' rises from the watery depths of Los Angeles harbor to seek revenge against the five people responsible for the death of Danny and himself. Sarah will help guide and comfort Ashe as he defines his mission.

'The Crow - City of Angels' certainly doesn't achieve the level of cult masterpiece as the original did, however few sequels ever do. With that understood put all your needs and desires to make comparisons aside and simply enjoy the second installment of 'The Crow Mythos.'

Vincent Perez is quite good as the new Crow and Mia Kirshner is absolutely beautiful as the dark, ethereal Sarah. I couldn't take my eyes off her. I also enjoyed the small but memorable role played by Thuy Trang as Kali.

I personally thought it looked amazing. Then I heard that there was a movie called The Crow which stared Brandon Lee. Most people said The Crow was an amazing movie, but when The Crow City Of Angels came out, most people said this was an awful movie.

When I was in grade 5, I watched The Crow, and man, I LOVED it. In grade 9 I watched The Crow: Salvation, and Loved it. Also in grade 9 I watched The Crow: City Of Angels... I LOVED IT. I watched The Crow: City Of Angels MORE than any other Crow movie out there. Probably because the concept was better with Romance.

People complain about how crappy it was because it's not as good as the first, but however FEW PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT WASN'T EVEN MEANT TO REPLACE THE FIRST. It was meant to give Crow fans a new chapter.

So what if it's not the first Crow movie, NO CROW movie will ever live up to the first, Nor Salvation, nor Wicked Prayer. Sure, It's not as strong as the Crow was, but guess what, it's a TOTALLY different movie.

The acting of The Crow: City Of Angels NEEDED to be worked on, because The acting isn't exactly the best. I forgive that though, because if NOT for Mia Kirshner and Iggy Pop, the movie probably would have been A LOT worse. Vincent Perez has a VERY good look as The Crow, but his acting yet, was NOT good, and also because of his swedish accent.

The story of The Crow: City Of Angels was in my opinion better than the first, because of Sarah; She falls in love with her past (her past meaning Ashe Corvin coming from the dead). Unfortunatly, they DIDN'T show the romantic scenes as people say the Uncut version did. If you watch the trailer for The Crow: City Of Angels, you can catch a glimpse of Sarah and Ashe kiss which is good.

I would say the movie focused more on Sarah and Ashe than on the adversaries that Ashe has to confront, which is why I loved it.

I noticed that people like the movie more NOW than when it first came out, probably because it got more tame over the years.

OVERALL: FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THE CROW CITY OF ANGELS, if you want to watch it and compare it to the first, you probably won't like it, but if you respect it as for what it is; A DIFFERENT MOVIE THAN THE FIRST, It's good on its own.

817253,4,6304259093,"After he and his son, Danny, are brutally murdered, Ashe Corven is resurrected by the ""mystical"" crow in order to avenge the slayings. He is transformed into ""The Crow"" by Sarah, now all grown up and living in L.A. She paints his face to match that of her first Crow, Eric Draven, and sets Ashe on his path to avenge his son and himself and reunite with Danny in death.

I'm one of the many Crow fans who actually liked the second movie. I thought the visuals were amazing. The colors of the city popped when they needed to and faded into the background when they needed to. The soundtrack was a mish-mosh of artists but the styles of all of the artists blended perfectly with the style of the movie.

Vincent Perez was great as the grieving father. Ashe wasn't supposed to be another Eric Draven, he is another character all by himself. Stop comparing him to Eric Draven and Brandon Lee!!!

Mia Kirshner was pretty good as an all grown up Sarah. Sarah had alot of crap happen to her, as we saw in the first movie. My only issue is that sometimes she has an ""I'm so goth I'm dead"" complex but that's her style of acting (check out the L-word if you don't believe me). If you read the comics it goes a little more into her character, not much, but enough.

This movie is an entirely different entity from the first movie. I love the first movie and hate that Brandon Lee will never know the acclaim he deserves for his last work, but don't hate the second movie out of principle. Watch the movie as if it was the only Crow movie to ever be made and then read the comic and you'll get a better understanding of the story as a whole as well as an appriciation for the hard job it was to create a sequel to a movie with the legacy left by the original. Plus a few plot holes and subplots may get cleared up, like that whole Ashe loves Sarah thing.

Don't listen to reviews of the movie by other people, including my own, watch the movie and make up your own mind. Remember that the movie isn't really a sequel, it's just another story in a franchise. Kind of like the comics.",1122854400,5,2071,4.246192893401015
817254,1,6304259093,"Before reading on, please note that I only give this movie 1 out of 5 stars, but Amazon won't display it correctly for some reason. Anyways, carry on.

After the huge success of ""The Crow"", one automatically assumed that a sequel would soon be in the works. However, due to the tragic death of the original film's star, Brandon Lee, there was some doubt as to whether or not a new film should be made. In the end it was decided that each new Crow film would feature an all-new character taking over the avenging mantle.

This decision didn't set well with some fans of the original. Many of them felt that continuing the series without the presence of Brandon Lee would be trampling upon the memory of his performance. Personally, even though I do agree that Brandon Lee portrayed the best version of the Crow, the idea of changing out the main character every time suited the franchise perfectly. Not to mention, the original film didn't exactly leave an open ending for the return of Eric Draven. So, even if Brandon had lived, I think this was the proper course for the series to take.

""The Crow: City of Angels"" is set in a city resembling a completely depraved version of Los Angeles. Slowly destroying this city one life at a time with a highly addictive drug is the sick and twisted Judah Earl (Richard Brooks) and his gang of deviants. One of their latest victims, a man named Ashe (Vincent Perez), who was brutally murdered along with his young son by the gang, has returned to avenge their deaths. Joined by a mysterious young woman named Sarah (Mia Kirshner) and the mystical crow, Ashe begins his mission of revenge. However, will he be strong enough to stop the evil that destroyed his life?

Despite the assurances from screenwriter David Goyer that this film would rock, while paying respect to the first film, and above all, please even those fans of the original that felt it was tantamount to sacrilege to continue the series; in the end, this sequel just does not work. So, how could this happen when it seemed that the movie had so much going in its favor?

Well, for starters the story written by David Goyer (""Batman Begins"") is even darker, more twisted, at times sadistic, and utterly weak that it can't help but pale in comparison to its predecessor. The original film was dark, and featured some undeniably twisted characters for villains, but they never reached this level of depravity. Even in that film's darkest moments I didn't get the sense that those times were simply being included gratuitously to push the envelope of edginess in film.

For instance, there were numerous occasions where rather than include some much needed character or plot development the movie opted to show more sadistic and/or perverse imagery. Typically this was done at a time when Ashe was soon to be encountering one of the gang members responsible for his murder. Obviously these scenes were to make us hate the villains even more than we already do. The problem is that these moments occur far too often in a single 90 minute movie. Plus, it was a lazy way to convey the evil inherent in a particular villain, so that when Ashe dispatches his brand of justice the audience will be completely on his side. This was unnecessary because only the coldest of viewers would not completely hate characters willing to kill a father and his son. So, to go to such extremes just to give us these extra tidbits of incentive to root for Ashe was irrelevant.

I for one don't want to be force fed in such an obvious fashion via these demented sequences that this gang and its leader are evil incarnate. Find some compelling way to tell the story, and over the course of the movie reveal these various criminal activities or dark traits to me. You don't have to beat me over the head with this crap in an almost non-stop manner for me to understand the sheer malevolence on display. I'm not so dense that I can't pick up on plot points and character development spread out over the course of a movie.

Beyond the degeneracy on display from the completely one-dimensional villains, the two ""good"" characters Ashe and Sarah were uninteresting and boring compared to any of their forebears from the original. Their moments together were intended to showcase them as star-crossed lovers, plus give us some insight into their characters. Ultimately though, there was no real spark between the two of them and I never really got to learn much more about them either. Part of me believes this is due to neither performer really giving their all in the scenes, on top of the fact that the script was paper-thin.

Honestly, if it wasn't for the obligatory flashback sequences filling us in on what happened to Ashe and his son, we really wouldn't know much about him or care. Truth be told, the only reason we even remotely root for him to succeed is because of the unbelievably heinous nature of the criminals he's hunting, which again is due to the repeated usage of disturbing imagery and the flashbacks of the murders.

As for Sarah, there were several unanswered questions surrounding her character. Such as, what exactly is her link to the mystical crow and how did it come about? Plus, is she on the run from her memories or just can't stand being in a single location for too long? Maybe her whole backstory is a combination of the two or neither. Whatever the case may be, screenwriter David Goyer managed to mishandle virtually every single aspect of this film's story from start to finish. This meant that no matter how incredible the director or actors and actresses may come across, the movie was destined to fail from the get-go.

It is due to weak points in the story such as these that led this sequel to feeling like some half-hearted, under-developed attempt at cashing in on the previous movie's success and perhaps even the memory of Brandon Lee. Thankfully, in the years since ""The Crow: City of Angels"" David Goyer appears to have fine-tuned his writing skills, and has crafted many a terrific screenplay. Perhaps it was just an off day for him when he wrote this drivel or the studio and/or director hamstringed him during the filming and editing processes. Who knows?

Speaking of the film's director, Tim Pope, this is as far as I can tell his only feature film work to date, otherwise he's typically a music video director. I will grant Tim that he was straddled with a shoddy screenplay full of sickness and disgust, so the task of making this film even remotely entertaining was daunting. Although, he is apparently a fan of rocker Iggy Pop's, who also happens to appear in this film and Iggy is one twisted individual from what I can tell. So, maybe this movie wasn't a challenge to work on after all, except for the whole ""make it entertaining"" part. Hmmm...

Anyways, I should give some credit to Tim and his crew for creating a very eerie atmosphere for the movie. Where the original film seemed to borrow heavily from Tim Burton's influence, this movie featured a distinctive tone all its own to set it apart from not only the previous movie, but any comparisons to other darker heroes as well. Beyond that, I don't have anything really good to say for Mr. Pope, because he doesn't appear to be all that talented of a director in my estimation. Every scene featuring the criminals felt repetitive, as did scenes of Ashe riding his motorcycle or talking with Sarah. Nothing about this movie's visual style, beyond the look and atmosphere, stood out or was exciting in any respect.

Finally, we arrive at the film's cast, or as I think of them, the last remaining weak links in this already fragile chain. To begin, new lead star Vincent Perez (""I Dreamed of Africa"") was a poor follow-up to Brandon Lee's superb performance as Eric Draven. Now, I didn't set out to compare the two actors' performances, but being a sequel a comparison is inevitable and in my estimation, warranted. Vincent never seemed to possess, or at least be able to convincingly convey the rage of his character the way Brandon did with Eric. With Vincent, he always seemed uneasy and when he did begin to cut loose in a possible fit of rage, he wound up looking goofy. Plus, his character seemed too effeminate much of the time, so I was never really sold on him being the avenging type, which would be the key for Vincent to really sell this character to the audience.

Portraying the only returning character from the original film, Sarah, although this movie is set several years later in her life, is actress Mia Kirshner (""The Black Dahlia""). Mia as shown in various other projects, both in film and on TV, is a very capable and talented actress. Yet her portrayal in this film, as I touched upon earlier, is incredibly disappointing and uninspired.

Maybe her reasons for not appearing as committed to the role as I felt she should be is due to her character's bizarre, unexplained traits and lame story arc. I mean, if I were in her shoes, and given a character that is exhibiting odd abilities and seems to be on the run from something in her past (which doesn't make sense given how things were looking up for her at the closing of ""The Crow""), then I would probably find it difficult to get into the role. So perhaps the blame cannot fully rest with her, but must be laid once more at the feet of David Goyer and his script, or director Tim Pope.

Rounding out the main characters of this movie are actor Richard Brooks (TV's ""Law and Order"") and rock star Iggy Pop (""Snow Day"") as the film's primary villains. Actually, I must correct myself, if you looked at the movie's screen time for the various characters, you would make the assumption that these two villains were the only main characters of the story, and that Ashe and Sarah were ancillary roles rather than the leads. Anyways, I digress.

As the leader of the gang responsible for Ashe and his son's murder, Judah Earl, is Richard Brooks. Much like Mia Kirshner, I know Richard Brooks is a capable actor in other roles, but even though his actions are despicable and steeped completely in all things evil, he as a character was never menacing. His performance just never really sold me on Judah being this man that commands the respect of all these deviants that he surrounds himself with, and that he would be in control of an apparently vast drug empire. I just don't see how he would have risen to such a powerful role compared to some of his underlings, in particular the most immoral and wicked of the gang, Curve played by Iggy Pop.

Speaking of Iggy, his portrayal of Curve was over-the-top, twisted, and had an underlying streak of insanity running throughout. Out of the entire cast, Iggy's was the only performance that was interesting, if for no other reason than that I wasn't sure what exactly he was going to do next. So at the very least he proved to be an intriguing presence, even though his character takes part in seemingly every vice conceivable by man. That being said, he also is given numerous ridiculous lines of dialogue that are so bad it's laughable, and many times he seemed to be overacting which made his performance amateurish at best. It is with those thoughts that make the fact that his was the most memorable performance of the bunch, all the more sad and pathetic.

You know, it's a shame that such an excellent movie could kick start what should be a promising franchise, only to have said franchise begin to falter with the first sequel out of the gate. But, that's what happens when your follow-up is plagued by a horrible script that is bogged down by the sickest and most twisted individuals one can conceive of, uninteresting performances for the most part, and repetitive sequences that show zero creativity or imagination. If you enjoyed the original movie, but never got around to this particular sequel, feel free to skip it. Trust me, you haven't missed anything.

If you take this one as a stand alone project, you might have a different interpretation. It is a little darker and heavier than the first. So you really have to be in to this sort of thing to watch it. Vincent Perez, who is a wonderful actor, pulls off the role rather nicely. However, I will have to agree with some of the other reviews about his character not being real sure of where he's going or what his role is. I loved the way it was shot and the color pallette that was used. It really stuck to the original in that respect. However, the big bad was pretty lame. But overall, I have to say that I enjoyed the different view and the story that was being told.

While Sarah and Gabriel make reappearances in this film, their roles are fairly trivial, leading to Sarah's death in the end.

817358,4,6304259093,"This film is a great dark vision of life and it questions our faith and trust in it that has some density only in our illusion of love. Life is nothing but a showcase that hides the real dark world of death that lurks behind the wings of the crow, the wings of the stage on which we strut like peacocks. And in those wings we could find, if we dared to go behind them, death in all its forms, in all its shapes, be it drugs, be it extreme sex, be it violence, be it torture, be it suffering. There is no escape from this unfathomable truth. This vision is a deep dive and high jump into what rots and reeks beneath the surface of our sunny world, of our rich society, of our brilliant culture. Beneath it all there is only the coming doom of the end forecast by some blind visionary, some blinded priestess, some self-blinded witch that will cast her oracle onto us when she wants, when she decides, because it is her fate to do so when her blind vision will cease or become too bright for her eternal night. What can we do against this destiny ? Nothing except maybe become as bad as all this is, and get our vengeance on the puppets who are manipulated by some evil force that they do not even know exists. Evil is eternal and bottomless. Evil is the only future we keep in our heritage from the dark centuries of the past. He who thinks God is dead is right. He who thinks Satan never existed is right. He who thinks that man is the only perpetrator of his own doom is right. The doom of humanity will not come from some transcending force but only from the rule that the supreme predator that man is will eventually destroy the whole species, and man is already at work in that direction, some men being ready to kill everyone and even the planet and life as a whole in the name of the survival of the fitter, that is to say of them who will then destroy themselves when they do not have any more preys to chase after and kill. The survival of the fittest, then, will mean the end of the whole humanity and the return of chaos, which is nature naked and brutal because chaos is a human concept to describe the natural order of the eternal cycle of life and death. And in our malediction we may keep, in the deepest and darkest layers of our mental eye, the image of a child that could not survive this hazardous providence. God bless the child. But since the child is dead who can bless hilm ?

The next movie in the Crow series (Salvation), created a sustained game of cat and mouse between the hero and the bad guys. It really created some tension. This movie, by contrast, seemed like a series of unrelated events. The episodes of revenge didn't build on each other - if they had been edited into any other order, it probably wouldn't have made much difference.

The ending seemed weak. I like some mystery, I don't need to have eveything explained, but I want a movie to follow its own internal rules. This one just seemed to make up new mysterious forces whenever the scriptwriter got confused.

The visual styling is noir grunge, and fairly effective. The majority of the movie has a nearly monochromatic color scheme in one hue or another. The last scene, in the afterlife, was dominated by blues. Cool and calm, it worked. The majority of the movie used tones of orange, though. I found the choice of color odd, and just never developed a strong response to it.

I like The Crow as a series, I like the gritty city images, and I like thoughtful use of color to set a mood. I just didn't like this.

But this film is meant to be different; in a different place, different time and with similar circumstances happening to very different people.

Vincent Perez brings his own stylings to this already overly stylish film. The use of reds and yellows to give the city a feeling of dirt, smog and an overcast of despondency works fairly well. The whole film feels much more surreal than even the first film's city did; the people here, more corrupt, violent and perverted but it's the triangle of stories that give the film the boost that pushes it out of the gutter of failed sequels.

Mia Kirshner does a fair job of playing a much older Sarah though her face reamins a bit too blank when there should be more emotion. Ashe, the new Crow and his son are, of course murdered for being in the wrong place at the wrong time and end up at the bottom of the sea. Upon the Crow's return he receives help from Sarah to begin his trail of revenge. The triangle here is that while he tries to carry out said revenge, he falls in love with Sarah at the same time, the main evil doer this time around, Judah, plots to do whatever he can to stop Ashe before he gets to him. Iggy Pop makes a wacky appearance as one of Judah's subordinates, Curve, getting to be his usual out of control self, even after all these years.

In any case, the sets, the costumes, and especially the music, definately give the same overall feel of the original- if anything it is even more gritty and extreme.
The character of Ash is not your typical macho action hero. He is decent, sensitive, average guy- who has his only son murdered in front of him.

817463,5,6304259093,"People fail to realize that Brandon Lee's character Eric Draven is not the crow but another person that is given the crow's powers. There have been many crow's before him and there will be many after. I think that this movie was great, it had a new look and feel to it that fit the story good. Its sad that Brando lost his life during the making of the first but why let a good franchise die with him. The Crow isn't a super hero that fights crime and saves the world. For a short period of time a perosn is given the powers of the crow to get revenge and once they get revenge they give up the powers and die. So what would be the point of having Brandon Lee play the Crow again if he fulfilled his mission in the first movie.
I hear they are making the 4th movie in the series titled The Crow: Wicked Prayer. I hope this one is as good as the first 2. The 3rd one was decent but not as good as the first 2.",1055808000,10,908,3.9135135135135135
817464,3,6304259093,Face the facts and realize what the whole crew went through the first Crow film. Brandon Lee was killed on set and on film! Supposedly because of a curse linked with his fathers' past and a myth of the curse of the crow the bird itself. Anyways I can't believe that this came out and I am very surprised. It's not very good but it's also not very bad. Deftones make a cameo in it... remember the deftones...they used to be good. Anyways if you liked the first crow and heard of it's terrible luck with it's history of the making of the film than check this one out. This is one of those movies that are made because The Crow story itself could have been a great franchise but with the main character literally dead and a few dead ringers who just present a thin whit line of what Brandon Lee use to present as the crow this movie is okay but could never have been better than it is!!!,1050883200,,884,4.175438596491228

Everybody always says that sequals will never be as good as the originals. In this movies case, I believe they should have stuck with only the first one.  The plot was alright, but the acting and casting, downright unworthy of the release rack.  After seeing this move I made a promise never to watch another sequal.",1048982400,,425,4.2875

well, all I can say about it is that it [stunk]. There was one fighting scene, and that really didn't live up to all the ""fighting for justice"" thing that The Crow set for the rest of them. and the follow up, trying to stay in the spotlight of the first was tacky. It was alright, but it really didn't follow the realness of The Crow. I didn't really take to Ash anyway. I could more relate to Eric.
There was also the fact of there was a bit too much information when it came to the clubs. And they really didn't have to add some of the things at the end. I didn't like it. [sorry for the spoilers there...]
It's not just because I am a major Brandon Lee fan, and I know no one can beat an original, but I know that Vincent Perez was almost there in the whole thing about walking in his shadow and succeeding, but he wasn't quite there.

817594,4,6304259093,"I realize this movie is seven years old, but I was surfing the net and happened to see that Crow City of Angels was on television, so I thought I'd put in some positive words for this film. This is like the 20th time I've watched it. First of all, you have to forget THE CROW. It has no ties to the first one, it's a completely original character and story. It goes without saying, the first one is better. THE CROW is my favorite movie of all time. This movie is not bad though. It received so many negative reviews from critics however, which is too bad, because it is a very good movie. Vincent Perez does a wonderful job portraying Ashe; a man murdered along with his son, Danny, after witnessing a murder. Sarah (the litte girl from the first movie) returns in City of Angels, played by Mia Kirshner, to look after Ashe. Judah, played by Richard Brooks, doesn't even come close to Top Dollar, who was the main villain in the first movie, but he's ok. Judah does have one of the film's best lines though, when Ashe tells him to go to hell and he says ""Already been there, and I must confess, I like what I saw.""
 The dark and dreadful mood is still wonderfully intact, which I love. The look of this film is just as good as the first. There are so many great moments in this movie that I can never forget, such as when Sarah paints Ashe's face with Danny's old paints, the part where Ash pulls Curve's body out into the water and flowers surround him in the form of a crow, and the unforgettable ending when Judah is destroyed. It's classic. Another great aspect of this movie is how Ash mocks the words of the killers - what they said just before they killed him and his son - just before he kills them.
 I think most people never even wanted to give this movie a chance because of what happened to Brandon Lee, and that's understandable but at the same time a shame because a great talent was passed over in Vincent Perez, and a great movie as well.",1044230400,2,1955,4.252688172043011

It doesnt, even if he had lived he wouldnt be in this movie. The characters are completely different people for a reason, showing that all kinds of people can come back for vengeance. The problem I had with it is that it was too much like the first, almost trying to copy it(i.e. The similarity of Brandon and Vince's look). I think Salvation did a better job by changing the victims dress, hair, etc.. No movie will ever top the first but, this one tried to, buy using the same formula, long hair, black leather clothes, and a little birdie.

So, I fail to see the reason why there should be a sequel other than to make a quick buck or two.  But that's just me.  I am not trying to change anyone's mind, and I am not trying to say that I am right about everything.  It all comes down to taste in the end.
I'll give the movie some credit: It looks spectacular.  At least it didn't lose the darkness and danger like the last two Batman movies did.  I guess the big problem for me was the story.  I don't know.  It just didn't affect me the way the first one did.  The bad guys seemed a lot more eviler and creepier as well.  (How can one not shiver at the sight of Michael Wincott?)
DVD is pretty poor as well.  No eye-popping special features on this disk.  Then again, I didn't like the movie all that much, so I guess it really doesn't matter to me.
Again, maybe it's because I'm so in love with the first movie.  I just think that ""The Crow: City of Angels"" failed to entertain me on the level the first one did.  It looked awesome, but that's the only good thing about the movie.  But, to say something positive, I will take this movie over ""Batman Forever"" or ""Batman and Robin"" any day.

When Ashe pursues Spider Monkey he calls himself ""all your worst nightmares rolled into one"".  Whatever inspired writer David Goyer to sink to 80's horror dialogue I don't know, but anyways on with the review.
This film had incredible production design, great costumes, a superior instrumental score (by Graeme Revell) and an overall gothic feel.  I'm not saying it's better than the first film, I am merely saying that if this film had not received so much hype before it's release and people had not panned it for not being Brandon so much than maybe it would have been better received.

817705,1,6304259093,"While many of the images in ""The Crow - City of Angels"" will stay with you, viewers will come away from this pretentious sequel wishing that the director's/writer's better selves had taken the helm. This murky sequel to the entertaining ""The Crow,"" starring the late Brandon Lee, has the dark gothic taste down pat. Unfortunately, images of torture, sexual orgies and sadism exploit fans of this genre lowering the series to the worst denominator.
At times laughably bad and amazingly inept, ""The Crow - City of Angels"" subtitutes style and the unique with typical and has-been. Vincent Perez certainly looks the part of the brooding anti-hero, risen from the dead to avenge the murder of his son. And Mia Kirshner makes a fine heroine, a pseudo tatoo-artist mentor who leads Perez into his predictable odyssey through a Los Angeles futuristic netherworld of drug addicts, sexual deviants and homeless children. But where this sequel loses direction is in its glorification of brutality - from prisoners of the main villain, to innocent victims in the streets of this civilization where the sun never rises.
Certainly the character of The Crow, an inspired combination of Batman, the Vampire Lestat and Ozzy Osbourne, is the stuff fueled by imaginative adolescent nightmares. This series will always have at least that going for it. Trenchcoats, motorcycles, smeared make-up, bad hair days - The Crow must rank as one of the hippest superheroes in history. And occasionaly director Tim Pope (obviously schooled at the MTV film institute) produces a strong image or two in spite of himself. The Crow lounging on the side of a building is the stuff of great blacklight posters. The Crow marching down a dark alleyway towards a retreating villain is an impressive portrait.
But for all these visions, the viewer is force-fed the typical - the wooden Iggy Pop as a mannequin villain, the unexceptional Richard Brooks as a one-note ringleader of evil, the faceless Thuy Trang as a high-kicking murderess. Undoubtedly ""The Crow - City of Angels"" has been inspired by multiple films of Japanese cinema, popularized in Western culture by the works of John Woo and mimicked by Hollywood with ""The Matrix,"" and there are times when squinting your eyes just right, you might be able to see English subtitles (I am kidding, of course).
But then comes the predictable B-Movie scenes of brutality, the obvious symbolism of the Day of the Dead celebration, and the excessive servings of faceless murder. And the final conflict of this contrived drama, where what appears to be thousands of crows fly through the soul of the main villain, is about as lazy a resolution/triumph as you will ever see in a film.
Darkness comes from a tortured soul, and it has far more depth than ""The Crow - City of Angels"" could ever hope to dream of. This film is indeed a nightmare, but for all the wrong reasons.",1022457600,3,2881,4.9300411522633745

Unlike the original Crow, City of Angels just feels flat all around.  The culprit here is the stale script and monotonous acting.  Though my opinion differs from the vast majority of reviewers, I thought the bright spot of the film was Perez.  I thought his manic portrayal of a father returned to avenge his childs death was right on the money.  The movie is a bust, but not entirely unbearable.",1014076800,,525,4.602150537634409
817707,5,6304259093,"I think that is the main reason why some people say they didn't like the film. The Crow-City of Angels is not meant to take the place of the first Crow film. It simply carries the idea to another story; a different story. Brandon Lee is not being replaced. Instead, another chapter opens with the character of Ash, played by Vincent Perez. Perez offered a very emotional performance. Unlike the first one, where the character of Eric Draven is mainly angry, the character of Ash is mainly sad. He has a vulnerability that the audience can really feel. When he and his son are murdered, Ash comes back to ""make the wrong things right while the crow shows him the way."" Instead of hunting down and immediately killing his murderers, he haunts them, offering a bittersweet revenge. The first Crow is great, however, the second offers more emotion and more complex acting. If you are a true fan of the Crow legacy, I don't see any reason why you wouldn't like this film.

The cinematography isn't bad, and the music is decent giving the film a gothic feel so long as nobody opens their mouth, but the script is best left to our friends at MST3K.  Our 'hero' is a weakling who resembles nothing of what Brandon started.  He a blubbering baby who never stops weeping, and Sarah is a character you'd just as soon read about in the obituaries.  The third installment of this series (The Crow: Salvation) is much better than City of Angels, but it remains a far cry from the original.  If you're looking for a gothic movie, check out Dark City.

As soon as it started,I knew it was impossible that this film could. The film has the wonderful Gothic look of the fist movie,and Vincent Perez looks the part too,but as soon as he is transformed into the crow his performance just did not work for me. When Brandon becomes the crow he has the menacing gracefulness,the moments of insanity and his softer side shows through when he is reunited with his friends from his former life,and he got the balance just right,sadly as perez weeps and gibbers and goes round banging on  steel drums etc it just sort of looks like a bad parody of Brandon Lees great performance. To top that we have IGGY POP as a bad guy and some other dodgy Mad Max 2 rejects with crazy haircuts running around gibbering as well,allthough the lead bad guy Judda almost hits the mark. Iggy may play the ageing hellraiser well,but he looks out of place here. The showdown with the aforementioned cheif bad guy also adds to insult as where we had a stunning shootout followed by a stunning dislay of martial arts skills inherited from his legendary father Bruce that then leads to a tense showdown in a dark gothic church in the first movie,perez climbs a tower (or tries too)and then ends up firing a flock of crows out of his chest (or something).I really do feel I could of made a better job of directing this film to make it more satisfying for fans of the first film and I have no experience in that field at all obviously else I would not be sitting here moaning about it! The only reason I would by this is to look in disbelief and say how did this happen,IT COULD OF BEEN SO MUCH BETTER!The third instalment of the franchise""Salvation"" is still no way as good as the orignal but worth more of a go than this.

817711,5,6304259093,"The Crow - City of Angels, to me, is an excellent film. It manages to be an entertaining sequel without stealing anything away from the original. The character, Ash played by Vincent Perez(I Dreamed of Africa,Swept From the Sea), is brutally murdered along with his young son and then...you know the rest...a crow will show him the way. Vincent Perez gave an excellent performance that is bursting with emotion. He manages to portray exactly what the character is feeling. The character of Ash is completely different from that of Brandon Lee's Eric Draven. What is fun to watch, however, is the physical similiarities they both share, being around the same height, lean build, and age. I liked the make-up much better in this one, not as dramatic as the first; less is definately more!
Once Ash is geared up and ready to go, he one by one hunts down those who wronged him leaving behind a symbol of how they took part in his murder. The set is gothic and dark, the special effects are well rendered, and the acting is excellent. The only complaint that people may have is that it is not Brandon Lee. All I can say is, take the movie for what it is, a different story and installment of the crow fantasy, NOT a replacement of the first. If you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend it. Although I am still a huge fan of Brandon Lee, I like this installment of the Crow just as much if not more. After seeing this film, I instantly became a fan of Perez's as well.

The weird thing about The Crow: City of Angels is that I disliked it more out of frustration then the horrible lack of any kind of quality. I actually was intrested in the idea that each movie that comes out would be unconnected to the previous movie and have it's own unique spin. I thought that was an clever way to keep, what was then a viable franchise, fresh.  Sometimes I find that the problem with sequels is that the whole movie seems forced in a way. So going into this movie, for a moment or two, I'm feeling this blank-slate start to the sequel gave the movie the potential to be better than the first Crow. Unfortunately everyone on this movie seemed to just drop the ball over and over and after the first twenty minutes any kind of momentum Goyer's story had gained disintegrates into same revenge-o-rama that was found in the first movie. And for all his luscious command of texture, Pope cut his teeth making music videos - and it shows. He pads the now-uneventful story with at least three. There's the ""Just Discovered I'm The Crow and I Think I'll Ride My Motorcycle"" video. There's the ""Here's L.A. By Night, Sort of Looks Like Blade Runner"" video (a perennial hit with many sci-fi directors). And there's the ""I Want To Fall in Love With You But I Think I'll Ride My Motorcycle Instead"" video. Despite the fact that the soundtrack includes music by Hole, Filter, Bush, White Zombie, Seven Mary Three, P.J. Harvey and N.Y. Loose, these sequences are cotton wadding for the mind. The movie, in the end, is even less - and that's a pity. The first Crow was undone by circumstances beyond anyone's control. Brandon Lee (son of Bruce, and around whom it was hoped they could build a series) was accidentally shot to death during a stunt, and the film released was pasted together from the action sequences, which were most of what they'd managed to film. Here, with Perez - visually, a virtual double for Lee- they had an opportunity to give a fascinating idea for a franchise a proper launch, and they've blown it.",982368000,6,2244,4.495098039215686
817817,4,6304259093,"Now let's set the record straight.  I like Brandon Lee as much as the next guy, but everyone say the Crow was better.  I will say this as far as the bad guys are concerned.  You have my vote on the first movie.  Crow COA's bad guys were stupid except Kalie, she was a worthy ""bad girl.""  There others were unrealistic and silly and that took away from the movie.  Now the COA's crow, Vincent Perez, lost it! As in, his elevator don't go to the top floor.  Being a parent and if I lost my son I'd lose it too.  He had a emotionless look every time he killed a bad guy.  It was like, he was this really nice guy, but after this.  He'd never be the same again.  Brandon Lee was at his best in the Crow, but he was just plain mad.  Then Brandon's character was hacked up as far as the comic book is concerned, all those who read it, knows.  Brandon has all the moves with the martial arts, but his character didn't seem too disturbed.  He was just mad that someone wizzed in his cornflakes.  In fact, he really didn't seem to act like a ghost like Perez did.  Bradon seemed like he was the same person before he died.  Perez basically haunted the bad guy before he killed him.  For example, he crashed through a skylight and says""just the corpse of a familar face.""  Then toys with him before he kills him.  Perez has a darker side than Lee does.  The COA had motorcycles in the movie.  The COA had a Ducati and a Harley.  Those who ride knows these are the two most respected bikes around.  Both sounds nice when rolling down the street.  The original Crow had to foot it all the time, unless he rode with the police,lol.  I know most people hates this movie, because Brandon Lee is not in here.  What were you expecting him to do an oncore?  Well, if you want Brandon Lee don't see this movie, but if you like the Crow as in comic book.  You'll like this one, trust me.",980899200,7,1867,4.136871508379889
817818,1,6304259093,"I held off for the longest time renting this movie for the longest time because I thought that it was a way to cash in to the success of the first.  i decided that I wanted to see it because well, I thought I was being unfare and well, it might actually have some good qualities.  Well, I was right to be apprehensive.  This movie which felt like a really long tv show just made me cringe.  I rent good movies with the bad cause I'm a movie buff.  But City of Angels actually was painful to sit through.  Not because it clearly wanted to be what the first one was and more and  ends up being a bad copy of the first.  No, what makes this one of the worst movies I've ever seen is the way that it can't stand alone to save it's life.  If you haven't seen the first you are going to be lost and think this movie REALLY STINKS.  The characters are lame and very uninteresting, if not annoying.  The story just leaves you going, ""Are they purposely trying to insult my intelligence?""  I mean, the whole wrongful death sucks but I felt nothing and I and I am very easily emotionally moved. In a nutshell, just hollywood trying to cash in on the success of something and falling on it's face.",980294400,,1186,4.1535087719298245

Given, its nowhere near as good as the first one, but the first Crow is just a classic. It can't be beaten. But this movie is still good. Its not near as emotional in the first one. In the first one, you actually felt sorry for the characters, but in City of Angels, the plot is to just kill people. Not like thats a bad thing though. The lighting effects are really cool. Los Angelas is shrouded in a badass looking green fog.

It is horrible - the acting, execution of story, and the backdrop (a  green foggy mist engulfs Los Angeles...sick).  This is an insult to Brandon Lee who poured out his heart and soul to make ""The Crow"".  Vincent Perez is terrible in this film, he has no grace or rhythm when he moves, he has terrible fight scenes, he acts wimpy, and his dialogue is bad.  Only a couple of things good about this film, the name of the movie is cool, only it doesn't fit the material, and the tribute to Brandon Lee (VHS version, maybe DVD???) at the end of the movie.  In my opinion, they should of stopped with the first one, Brandon Lee as Eric Draven will always be the best.",972432000,5,788,4.326530612244898

A lot of the scenes (particularly those with Iggy Pop) have stayed in my head for eternity. I saw this movie before I knew anything about the Crow legacy, and I instantly loved it.  Slowly, I backtracked through the story's history until I watched the original.  Suprisingly, I found that I enjoyed watching The Crow:COA more than the original.  The death of a little kid and his father in the epitome of slums meant more to me than the death of an older couple in Detroit. Finally, I'd like to address Perez's accent.  Yes, it exists, there's no denying that.  But SO WHAT!??!  It makes it seem more realistic.  Not to bash the original film, but there's more credibility in this movie than there was about a rock musican who was killed the night before his wedding.",971222400,2,925,4.4523809523809526
817921,1,6304259093,This movie is a complete insult to Brandon Lee who starred and died in the  making of The Crow.  The main character is a wimp.  He is scrawny and not  very intimidating.  This movie is a complete insult to the original and  should not even be associated with The Crow.  Do not buy it!  Do not even  bother watching it!,965952000,6,318,4.166666666666667

It was not there! It was a dark drama, but  the story just never clicked. It just seemed to be a quick rip off hoping  to bank on the cult following established by The Crow with Brandon Lee.

817927,1,6304259093,"The weird thing about this movie is that I disliked it more out of frustration then quality (which is still poor ... don't get the wrong idea).  I actually liked that idea the each movie that comes out would have  it's own unique spin.  Sometimes I find that the problem with sequels is  that the whole movie seems forced in a way.  So going into the movie, for  a moment or two, I'm feeling this sequel has the potential to be better  than the first Crow. Unfortunately everyone on this movie seemed to just  drop the ball and after the first twenty minutes any momentum Goyer's story  had gained disintegrates into same revenge-o-rama that was found in the  first movie. And for all his luscious command of texture, Pope cut his  teeth making music videos - and it shows. He pads the now-uneventful story  with at least three. There's the ""Just Discovered I'm The Crow and I  Think I'll Ride My Motorcycle"" video. There's the ""Here's L.A. By  Night, Sort of Looks Like Blade Runner"" video (a perennial hit with  many sci-fi directors). And there's the ""I Want To Fall in Love With  You But I Think I'll Ride My Motorcycle Instead"" video. Despite the  fact that the soundtrack includes music by Hole, Filter, Bush, White  Zombie, Seven Mary Three, P.J. Harvey and N.Y. Loose, these sequences are  cotton wadding for the mind.  The movie, in the end, is even less - and  that's a pity. The first Crow was undone by circumstances beyond anyone's  control. Brandon Lee (son of Bruce, and around whom it was hoped they could  build a series) was accidentally shot to death during a stunt, and the film  released was pasted together from the action sequences, which were most of  what they'd managed to film. Here, with Perez - visually, a virtual double  for Lee- they had an opportunity to give a fascinating idea for a franchise  a proper launch, and they've blown it.",955584000,,1867,4.595744680851064
817928,5,6304259093,I loved this movie. It is one of the coolest movie I've ever seen. Iggy Pop also gives a great performance as gang ring leader Curve. I loved the director's use of color distortion as well. This movie is trying hard not  to just rip off the original which must be pretty hard since a guy back  from the dead seeking revenge leaves little room for variation.,949276800,6,357,4.313432835820896

818032,4,6304259093,"the idea of the crow does not deal specifically and exclusively to the character of Eric, in the first movie.  the crow idea of bringing back a dead one who was wronged has been expanded in the this movie.  the  characters in the movie are not supposed to replace the Eric or Brandon  Lee, but rather present a different view of the love that can bring someone  back.  i think a lot of people see this movie as moving in on Brandon Lee's  territory or something, and that's simply not true.  to do that one would  have had to recreate the Eric and Shelley senerio and do it over again.  this movie has wonderfully dark cinamatography that adds to the whole auro  of the hispanic-based city scenes and a beatiful score done by graeme  revell.  a delightful return to an age old myth.",946684800,2,782,4.384615384615385

DURING THIS ONE I WAS ACTUALLY NODDING OFF!! There  is hardly any character development, if you notice the the main character  Alex managed to strike all famous poses of Eric's right down to mirroring  the firey crow with a crow shape aparently made of glass?(WHEN DID HE  GATHER ALL THAT GLASS never mind) This film was put together for high box  office.(RIGHTFULLY BOMBED).

818122,5,6304259093,"I have seen this movie-and I personally think that it was very good. I was never really dissapointed at any time during the movie. I really don't think that Vincent Perez's character was anything like Brandon's. I saw the  original,and also thought it was very good. I think that Vincent did an  excellent job,and he should be commended for it. I have purchased both CROW  1 and 2,and it think that it was money well spent. I am a very big CROW  fan,and I think that the stories for both movies were very imaginative and  creative. It could not have been very easy for Vincent to accept this role  knowing what the outcome of the first one was. I admire him for his courage  and also for the incredible talent that he constantly displayed throughout  this movie. Mia Kirshner did an exceptional job creating her role as  Sara,and the other actors did very well with their roles. I don't think  that it is fair that this European Actor should be labeled as  a""Brandon Lee wannabe"" that simply is not the case. Vincent and  Brandon are 2 different men,and although both Actors and being extremely  talented, that is the only thing they really have in common. It is really  sad what happened to Brandon-and I miss not seeing him. But-Vincent is not  Brandon's replacement,and I honestly do not believe that he even considered  that as an option when he decided to play the role of ""Ashe  Corven"".  The story is nothing like the first one-and there aren't  even any characters that are alike. I really felt for Ashe and Danny,my  heart went out to them. A young, single father raising his son,and making a  living for himself and his son,what is wrong with that? the two of them are  spending time together one night, Ashe working on his bike,and Danny laying  on the floor painting a picture-that is something you really don't see  everyday. Once Danny hears the sound of a gunshot,he gets up and runs out  the door. Ashe goes after his son only to realize that Danny has seen  something that was not very pleasant,by then it's already too late.  Ashe  had every right to be angry and do the things he did when he came back. He  was just showing the emotions of a young man who had not only lost his  life,but he lost another precious thing-his son. What parent would not want  to get revenge on the person(s) who are responsible for murdering their  child,and right in front of them. Ashe loved his son,he was everything to  him-and Danny loved his dad-you could see the special bond between them in  this movie. All they had was each other,and that was not really so bad.

I loved the girl who played the little girl from the first movie. Her eyes were beautiful especially with the red makeup she had it made her eyes stand out. I love Vincent in this movie I feel like he made this movie his own with his acting and didn't try to copy the same acting Brandon Lee did. Although, they were both revived by the crow to get revenge and justice for being killed along with their loved ones. Vincent made it different so you could tell he was someone different playing a similar character. I definitely did love the way some of the characters died and the symbolism behind it which my favorite scene was motorcycle scene and following that character's death. I think its kind of poetic how the girl with the green eyes fell in love with Vincent but they could never be together. It seemed to be like he also fell in love, but he knew he was on borrowed time. It was such a beautiful movie in my opinion. Although it did not capture the same magic like the first movie did I still have tremendous love for this movie.",1521504000,,1213,4.232758620689655
