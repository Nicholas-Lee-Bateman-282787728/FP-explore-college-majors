3726023,5,B001O2SH7Q,"this is a set of four movies with Hedy Lamarr and she is beautiful in all of them. Algiers with Charles Boyer is a great movie, some of the others are just ok. George Sanders is in one and is interesting called the Strange Woman. in Dishonored Lady with John Loder it is a film about the fashion buisness and so she was dressed beautiful. the last fim Let's Live a Little with Robert Cummings is a screwball comedy sort of. a wonderful packaged collection of films of Lamarr. this is fun for movie nights with mom and i to watch beautiful Hedy and enjoy her films...these are so much better than movies from now a days, that we can watch these together with popcorn and a blanket and a cat in my lap.",1361577600,7,700,4.231343283582089
3726024,5,B001O2SH7Q,"I bought this DVD not knowing what kind of old classic films I was getting, All I knew was that Hedy Lamarr was so damn gorgeous in all her movies my favorite ""Hedy"" movie is ""Lady of the Tropics"" seen it on TCM late one night drinking wine (Her Birthday) that's when I new I was kinda of in love with this pretty Jewish gal. Every movie in this DVD collection is GREAT, if Hedy is in it you have to love it RIGHT! This all I have too say about this Sexy dame.

PS: I also enjoy gazing at Anne Hathaway as well.",1358467200,5,511,3.9134615384615383

8328967,4,B001O2SH7Q,"Isn't she lovely?  Synergy's 'Silver Screen Legends' series Hedy Lamarr set offers a collection of four independent titles that have fallen into the public domain, each on its own fully mastered disc (no DVD-Rs here), albeit varying in terms of image and audio quality from very good to poor.  Included are:

'Algiers' (1938) - Walter Wanger's remake of French classic 'Pepe Le Moko' (1937) doesn't pack quite the punch the original does, but director John Cromwell manages to pull solid performances from a top-notch cast (including Charles Boyer, Alan Hale and Gene Lockhart) for a Hollywoodized version that compares reasonably well.  Film rates 3 1/2 stars; print is worn but watchable with clear sound-- better than most grey-market copies.

'The Strange Woman' (1946) - Sam Goldwyn's highly atmospheric period drama is a wickedly good low-budget noir in the poison-female mold.  Directed by cult favorite Edgar Ulmer and co-starring George Sanders, Louis Hayward and Gene Lockhart.  4-minus stars; sharpest print I've seen (at least as sharp as that found on the Ulmer three-disc collector's edition).

'Dishonored Lady' (1947) - Hunt Stromberg's somewhat standard crime-drama holds up well among its peers attempting to up the intellectual ante by integrating the day's pop psychology into its plotting. With Dennis O'Keefe and William Lundigan.  3-plus stars; one of the worst prints I've seen (VCI's is much better).

'Let's Live a Little' (1948) - Cute but minor entry in the screwball comedy genre is as silly as it is compulsively grin-inducing.  Featuring Robert Cummings in a strong comedic role and the much maligned Anna Sten doing a suitable job of self-parody.  3 1/2 stars; fair print with some unfortunate splicing and hissing throughout.

Content averages 3 1/2 stars, presentation 3, with the low price promoting the assemblage as a whole closer to 4 stars.",1436659200,18,1879,5.2441471571906355

Good greif, you folks at Amazon make reviewing products such a pain by requiring us to write reviews at a minimume of some many words.  I think just a Good, Excellent, or Terrible is good enough.",1374796800,,257,4.224489795918367
8328970,3,B001O2SH7Q,"With the exception of ""Algiers"" these prints are in really bad shape.  ""Let's Live a Little"" is barely watchable but it seems to be the only print available.  They are also from after she left MGM so the overall productions are not all that great either.  I would recommend this only if you are looking to fill out your Hedy collection and like the convenience of buying these titles in a set.",1372204800,8,393,4.430555555555555
