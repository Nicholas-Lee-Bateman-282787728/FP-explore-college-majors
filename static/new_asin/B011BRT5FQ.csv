7331960,5,B011BRT5FQ,great way to have all at once. love it,1463184000,,38,3.3333333333333335
7331961,1,B011BRT5FQ,VERY DISAPPOINTED!  We received this and attempted to download the digital copies to find out they only work in the UK.  ( I just now went back and saw the description mentioning this).  That was the main reason for our purchase.  I'm sure there is no way to return as it's opened already.  Not happy!!1,1458259200,11,303,4.4363636363636365

7331963,5,B011BRT5FQ,"Liked it, but it doesn't have the Road Warrior. Still great collection.",1454803200,2,71,5.0
7331964,5,B011BRT5FQ,The films look and sound good on my system. My only nitpick is that the first movie loads up with the American dub audio track but it's no hassle to change it.,1453334400,4,159,4.0

7331971,1,B011BRT5FQ,"Misrepresented, states it will play on all players but is actually region 2 and won't play on U.S. or Canada player.  Returned as defective and got charged a $6.80 restocking fee for a useless item that was falsely advertised.",1488412800,3,226,4.794871794871795

7331977,5,B011BRT5FQ,great movies,1475798400,,12,5.5
7331978,4,B011BRT5FQ,"the movies work great, was disappointed in the fact that I could not redeem the Digital versions, as this was a British version, and these can't be redeemed in the US, would have been nice to know that up front. I think these Digital codes should be universal, and it should not matter what version you have, you should be able to redeem it.",1475798400,10,341,4.34375
7331979,5,B011BRT5FQ,Excellent product!,1473897600,,18,8.5
7331980,2,B011BRT5FQ,"Beware - the difference between the non-US version (with the small circle labels in the bottom corners) and the US version is the non-US version has inferior audio quality. The non-US version makes you choose either a ""2S"" DTS-HD uncompressed, which my receiver read as a mono track, or a lossy Dolby Digital 5.1, for the first film. For the 2nd film, you have no uncompressed options - at best, 5.1 Dolby Digital lossy. The third and 4th are in uncompressed 5.1 and Atmos, respectively - no problems.

From research, the US version has uncompressed surround remixes for every film in the set. Some of you may not care about better audio, but to me it's half the point of Bluray and in my case makes a fancy speaker setup a lot less exciting -- even if you don't care for upmixes of old movies, you lose some quality in other areas like bass. More importantly, regardless of whether you care about the audio downgrade, the differences should be stated CRYSTAL clear without reading through conflicting internet forums or waiting for a copy to show up to read the back of the physical box.",1473552000,36,1088,4.608247422680412
7331981,5,B011BRT5FQ,"A fantastic price for four movies. Fury Road alone is almost worth the price. I didn't notice the discs were UK region, but that's my fault. It's clearly labeled all over the listing, I just wasn't paying attention. They play just fine on my player. Took a little fidgeting with a VPN to find out how to redeem the Ultra Violet digital download code while in the U.S. but it all works great now.",1472428800,2,395,4.351351351351352
7331982,5,B011BRT5FQ,superb,1468972800,,6,6.0
7331983,4,B011BRT5FQ,A great collection but be warned that the bonus documentary and the digital collection can only be played and accessed in the UK. I had not known this while purchasing the collection. If you do not live in the UK I would suggest buying the film's separately.,1468713600,7,258,4.51063829787234
7331984,5,B011BRT5FQ,"A staple cult classic anthology, looks and sounds perfect!",1467676800,,58,5.555555555555555

8724041,1,B011BRT5FQ,"Trashy, plotless amateur movie.  It reportedly took less than one-half million US$ to produce -- money wasted.  Brain-dead ""action"" movie with car crashes galore, but no real plot.  Mel Gibson was so young when he played in this (about 23 years old) so he can be forgiven for this total waste of time and talent.  Maybe he needed the money.  My advice is this:  Don't waste your time this way -- watch paint dry as that makes more sense.

Oh, before I forget:  I did not like the movie.",1530403200,,486,4.382022471910112
8724042,4,B011BRT5FQ,"Good audio, good video and a solid deal for this ALL regions anthology.  Bonus feature disk does NOT play in my region one player, however.  Furthermore, I could not download The Digital Downloads.

Minor squabbles, this anthology is truly an excellent deal.",1524355200,,258,5.095238095238095
8724043,5,B011BRT5FQ,Good movie's,1521849600,,12,5.5
8724044,1,B011BRT5FQ,"The review is not for the movies, but rather the UK anthology packaging. I didn't notice the call-out that the digital copy (UV) codes are only redeemable in the UK and am now stuck with something I can only watch with the disk. If that is what you want, it's still a good deal. Also be aware that the UV code I received says that it expires in 5/2018. Your mileage may vary.",1520985600,4,375,4.1506849315068495
8724045,5,B011BRT5FQ,Love the Mad Max movies - and this collection includes all and more.,1519516800,,68,4.3076923076923075
8724046,4,B011BRT5FQ,The only problem is that the first movie's audio is pretty bad. Otherwise Road Warrior is still the best of a series of good movies.,1518048000,3,132,4.32
8724047,5,B011BRT5FQ,Only wish it was Australian version instead of American.,1518048000,,56,5.333333333333333
