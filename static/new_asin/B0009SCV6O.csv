8066155,5,B0009SCV6O,I purchased the beginner DVD years ago. I dug out my jump rope and searched for more of Ropesport. I'm glad I found it on Amazon.  It's a fun workout.,1460937600,,150,4.0
8066156,1,B0009SCV6O,"I'm 6 foot 2 inches, and found when I got home that the rope is much too short for me.  i think anyone over 6 foot should avoid this product.

I wrote ropesport's customer service once a week for three weeks to inquire about how to swap for a longer rope, and finally got a reply that dared me to write poor reviews (!)

So, here I am

If you are buying this rope for anyone big, or anticipate needing customer service for anything, beware!",1265760000,2,440,4.141176470588236
8066157,4,B0009SCV6O,"This workout was a good, fun workout.  I worked up a sweat and stayed engaged throughout the whole workout.  Louis Garcia is a good instructor, encouraging and easy to listen to.  There was a lot of variety in the workout and I could feel each different style of jump requiring different things from my body.  The workout had a lot of potential to be really great if a few changes had been made.  First, I wish the actual jumping segments were longer.  I felt like more time was spent doing resting moves that jumping.  More jumping would have increased the level of intensity and made it a truly intermediate level workout.  As is, I'd say this is an advanced beginner workout.  Secondly, the workout, including warm-up and cool-down was about 30 minutes long.  Again, if it's going to be that short, there really needed to have been more jumping.  Also, I thought the warm-up should have been more movement oriented since the work-out is jumping.  Instead, Garcia went with stationary stretches.  The cool-down was a repeat of the same stretches.  I had to add additional stretches to make sure that I stretched out each part of my body.  Lastly the two ""celebrities"" are a real distraction and detract from the overall workout, especially Eric Nies.  I feel that they should not have been such a prominent part of the workout.  Nies even interjects purely superfluous commentary while Garcia is giving instructions.  The two of them are just really unnecessary but at least Kelly Packard is tolerable.

I really like this dvd series because it provided me with a repertoire of different jumping styles.  While I'm not at the point where I could put together and follow my own routine, I've learned a lot about technique and so I think if I stick with it, I will get to that point sooner than later.  Slowly, I am building endurance and coordination in jumping rope..  Overall, it's worth it to do this workout as an introduction to jumping rope for the cardio portion of your workout routine.",1263859200,3,1995,4.721739130434782
8066158,3,B0009SCV6O,"You can get a good work out with this video.  It would have been better if they would have shown the different techniques first instead of last and if they would have spent more time jump roping with each new technique.  But it is a great video to follow along, learn how to jump rope different style and you will definately work up a good sweat once you finish",1243468800,,361,4.217391304347826
8066159,2,B0009SCV6O,"Unfortunately, I cannot give this video a good or bad review.  I made the purchase thinking, ""this is going to be easy because I can jump rope"".  I actually LIKE to jump rope.  However, when I made the purchase, I wasn't thinking that there isn't space in the house to watch the video AND jump rope.  Therefore, I had to return it.  Good luck to those of you who have purchased it and have had success with it.  For those of you thinking about making this purchase, make sure you have space to actually use it.",1212278400,3,510,4.260416666666667
8066160,5,B0009SCV6O,"I am new to jump roping, I love the music and the instructors.  To me they make it interesting and fun.  The music makes me want to keep going and going.  I would recommend this as it got my heart rate up.",1202428800,5,205,3.8333333333333335
8066161,1,B0009SCV6O,"I weigh 200lbs and I am a 5'6"" female so I am not in the best cardio condition.  This Intermediate workout was a piece of cake.  You do more turning of the rope than actual jumping.  3/4 the DVD is stretching and instructional and the rest is sissy jumping.  If you are a guy or an athletic male/female looking for a challenge.  This is NOT it.

There are jumprope segments in Aerobox (with Kathy Smith + Michael Olajide) that are SOOOO much more challenging.",1192924800,14,459,4.404761904761905
8066162,4,B0009SCV6O,This is a great video which makes you sweat but I do recommend if you're new to jump roping to get the beginners first.  I'm new at it and it makes you work up a sweat.,1192579200,6,168,3.6666666666666665
8066163,5,B0009SCV6O,I've had it almost a month and I like it. My hips have trim a bit and I lost 5 pounds without any real dieting. I do it 4 times a week. With the help of this my stomach has gone back flat....I was getting a little belly and that's something I wasn't used to. About 10-15 mins into the jumps...sweat is pouring down my face and I am panting heavy. I figure I'd give it about another month...or until I can continuously do every jump before I move onto the next dvds.,1155081600,15,465,4.010752688172043
8066164,2,B0009SCV6O,"Louis Garica's video was ruined by the poseur d-list celebrities.  This video is MAD OBNOXIOUS!!!

Mr. Garcia is not bad, but the two d-listers were just AWFUL!

I can not recommend this and it's probably going into the trash, because I don't even want to re-sell it.

May I suggest AeroJump by Michael Olajide.  It's MUCH more challenging (not for the weak) and it's just Michael.",1154390400,11,381,4.712121212121212
