5170600,4,B008NNY8MW,Lara Hudson is a wonderful instructor- and I love the 10 min solution as it makes exercise accessible and easy for all. Everyone has 10 min!,1359504000,,140,4.423076923076923
5170601,4,B008NNY8MW,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the distributor.

This was only the second DVD that I have tried from instructor Lara Hudson.  (The first was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prevention-Slim-Strong-Firm/dp/B000MDH5JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prevention Slim, Strong & Firm</a>, which I did not like at all, as it felt like too much of a mish-mash of styles.)  Here, Hudson presents a Pilates DVD as part of the 10 Minute solution series.  Like all of the 10 Minute Solution videos, this DVD contains five 10-minute workouts, each of which can be used as either a stand-alone routine or combined with the other segments to provide a customizable workout experience.  The only equipment needed for these routines is the included resistance band and a yoga/Pilates mat.

The typical 10 Minute Solutions menu has been somewhat updated here, adding the menu option ""Instructions on How to Create Custom Workout.""  Otherwise, there are options to ""Play All,"" ""Play One Workout,"" or to select a custom workout routine from the following five segments:  Tightened & Toned Core, Defined Arms & Shoulders, Trim & Slim Lower Body, Total Body Toner, and Long & Lean Stretch.  For all of the routines, Hudson is exercising alone, teaching live in a well-lit studio.  I have broken down each segment below.

TIGHTENED & TONED CORE
Hudson begins lying with the band criss-crossed over and behind her shins.  From here, she performs the classic Pilates hundred move, 5 breaths in, 5 breaths out.  Keeping the band in the same position, she moves on to tick tock and then toe dips, first focusing the latter on the lower abs, then adding the arms to target the upper abs as well.  Placing the band around the feet (it has to go over the toes to remain in place), Hudson moves into seated hip rolls, adding in a rotation and then a pulsing move.  Next comes the double leg X, adding leg pulses to this.  Again keeping the band in the same position, Hudson rolls into table top and then into teaser, moving into two variations (rolling teaser and twisting teaser).  She concludes this segment with a full roll-up, adding a small backbend at the top.

TOTAL BODY TONER
Hudson states that this all-standing segment is based on standing ballet moves.  She begins with the band around her waist for hug-a-tree, adding in small arm circles, a plie, and releve.  This is followed by the spine twist with a leg kick.  Moving to a grand plie position, Hudson performs plies with a scapular rotation and then plies with a small standing backbend.  Next comes standing balance work:  placing the band under one foot, Hudson moves through bicep leg kicks, rear kicks with single arm raise, bicep curl, and back leg raise, repeating the entire series on the second side.  She concludes with a standing roll-up, adding a releve to the end of the move.

DEFINED ARMS & SHOULDERS
For this section, Hudson starts kneeling with the band under the knees for hug-a-tree and arm circles (arms front).  This is followed by chest expansion with triceps kickbacks.  Moving the band to under one knee only, Hudson does a series which includes draw the sword, shoulder press, and several moves in side plank (arm press, hip dips, hip pulse).  Returning to a standing position, Hudson moves through plie forward, releve back, and then she finishes with reverse hug-a-tree, adding in a rotation.  Although there were some nice moves in this segment, I found it to be a bit overly focused on the shoulders.

THIN & SLIM LOWER BODY
Here Hudson starts by criss-crossing the band over and behind her thighs for parallel bridge variations; she performs lifts, single leg lifts, and leg circles.  Holding the band around her thighs, Hudson transitions to a side-lying position for clam, adding a kick and leg lifts.  Next comes a turned out bridge series, again perform lifts, single leg lifts, and pulses.  This is followed by a sequence of side plank leg kicks that felt a bit awkward.  Hudson finishes this routine with a brief stretch in butterfly.  To me, it felt like Hudson tried to get a bit TOO creative with the band in this section; I missed the more traditional Pilates side kick series to work the thighs and glutes.

LONG & LEAN STRETCH
The stretch segment has more of a yoga-like than Pilates feel to it.  Using the band over one foot, Hudson begins the routine segment with a reclined leg stretch series.  Next comes a seated single leg hamstring stretch (head-to-knee pose) moving into what Hudson calls ""half lotus"" but which is actually more like firelog pose, a hip opener.  Then she does what she calls ""cat/cow with a twist,"" but this stretch is traditionally called kneeling thread the needle.  Moving into three-legged down dog, Hudson performs a hip stretch in this position (she does not use the band here).  Coming to standing, she holds the band in her hands for an around the world stretch and finishes with a shoulder stretch.

Overall, I thought that Hudson did a nice job with these workouts.  I definitely think she made better use of the band than in another 10 Minute Solution Pilates DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Slim-Sculpt-Pilates/dp/B002UQ1HPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Slim & Sculpt Pilates</a>.  However, as noted above, I thought that the arms segment focused too heavily on the shoulders and that the lower body segment didn't target the thighs and glutes as effectively as the Pilates side kick moves.  Otherwise, I did enjoy these routines, and I would recommend this DVD.

NOTE:  My only other complaint about this DVD had to do with the included band: it was a little on the thin side, and at times, it stuck to itself and bunched up, forcing me to pause in the middle of the workout.  The included instructions suggested sprinkling the band with baby/talcum, which I tried, and it helped somewhat.  However, the band still slips frequently, especially when positioned around the toes (which is not particularly comfortable for me and predisposes me to foot cramps).",1357948800,8,6118,5.038805970149253
5170602,5,B008NNY8MW,"I love Lara Hudson and all her 10 minute solution workouts.  She is really awesome and encouraging to workout with.  She does move quickly so if you are just starting out, know that.  It also can be a problem because working with the band, mine always gets jumbled up and stuck together so I have to pause the DVD to get the band back to normal.  These workouts go by really quickly and they can be as short as 10 minutes depending on your schedule.  Again, Lara is awesome.",1356652800,2,474,4.280898876404494
5170603,4,B008NNY8MW,"This video is very basic and good for beginners.  Some of the moves were a little difficult to pick up on.  The band is nice, but not the best quality.",1353715200,,151,4.0
5170604,1,B008NNY8MW,Way too complicated for a DVD instructional!!  I do enjoy the stretch workout and use it regularly.  The rest of it is overkill : ((,1352419200,,132,4.24
5170605,5,B008NNY8MW,"I just got this DVD in the mail today, and of course, I had to work out with it immediately.  The DVD includes a purple latex resistance band.  Nothing on the DVD tells you what level of resistance the band is, but my best guess is that is light resistance.  The only other thing you will need for this workout is a mat.

First impressions:

1) This is a difficult but enjoyable workout.  There is a lot of balance work, and the use of the resistance band added challenge and interest throughout.  One of the great things about Lara Hudson is that her workouts reward your effort.  The better your form gets, the tougher they get (and the better your results.)  The workouts literally grow with you.

2) Her cuing is excellent and her instructions on how to position the resistance band were spot on.  Despite this, I needed to go twice through the first segment, ""tightened and toned core"" to get the moves down.  I think that this is a good thing -- learning new moves is part of the reason I work out with Lara Hudson -- but if you haven't done a lot of balance work you might want to try another ten minutes solution pilates DVD first.  Suzanne Bowen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Slim-Sculpt-Pilates/dp/B002UQ1HPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Slim & Sculpt Pilates</a>&nbsp;may be an easier pilates plus resistance band workout for you, or if you are a total pilates beginner Lara Hudson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Pilates-for-Beginners/dp/B003QLEAQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Pilates for Beginners</a>&nbsp;will acquaint you with Pilates basics.

3) This, more than any other of Hudson's pilates DVDs, is a fusion workout.  She includes lots of moves from ballet, classic strength building and yoga.  So much so, that after the first segment, I was uncertain of how much of the workout was really derived from pilates.  However, pilates loves to borrow and adapt from other traditions.  What was important was that the workout was interesting, challenging and effective.  My muscles felt this workout all over my body.

4) Like the other Ten Minute Solutions Pilates DVDs, you can get a great workout from a single ten minute segment, but you'll probably enjoy it enough that you'll choose to do more.

TIGHTENED & TONED CORE:

This segment had more traditional pilates moves than the others.  It included classic moves like the hundreds and teasers done with the resistance band, as well as a number of moves that I had not seen before.  This was not only a core workout, but it also worked the arms heavily.  There was a lot of balance work and twists.  One of the things that I liked about this workout was that the resistance band not only provided resistance, but also helped me with the balance work and going deeper into the moves.

DEFINED ARMS & SHOULDERS; TRIM & SLIM LOWER BODY; TOTAL BODY TONER

These three segments blend classic strength building with toning moves derived from ballet and yoga.  Lara Hudson works multiple body parts throughout each of the segments.  For example, while the focus of the ""Defined Arms & Shoulders"" is upper body, it also worked the legs and core.  I found that I got a great arm workout and a decent lower body one no matter which segment I chose.

LONG & LEAN STRETCH

I liked how this section pushed my flexibility, but it was not easy.  The resistance band allowed me to work deeper into many stretches than I normally could go.",1349481600,56,3558,5.109185441941075
5170606,5,B008NNY8MW,"As a predominantly video exerciser, I have all of Lara Hudson's 10 Minute Solution DVDs. I think her DVDs are among the best of my collection of over 70 titles spanning 10 years. Each one is terrific with precise and clear cuing. She always manages to come up with innovative ways to present and than sequence her exercise segments. As a 50 year old with some neck and lower back issues, I find her DVDs to be safe and doable yet challenging and varied.  Her warmth, expertise, experience and devotion to Pilates and fitness shines through on every one of her DVDs. I have just purchased her 10 Minute Solution Pilates for Beginners, which I really like. (I would add that it is more an intermediate level DVD though) When this one comes out, I will purchase it without hesitation.",1344038400,5,781,4.578571428571428

She does a good job on showing, telling how to do the movements and what body parts it helps to tone up.
Once you do the Dvd a few times you'll get the routine down.
This perfect to do anytime of the day",1455840000,,227,3.75

5170618,2,B008NNY8MW,"I didn't feel like the band was used well to 'target' the parts it says it is. I would do a leg section but my arms were burning, etc. I love all the other 10 min solutions I've tried, but this one was not for me.",1444867200,,213,3.652173913043478
5170619,4,B008NNY8MW,Lara Hudson's workout is challenging and offers new ways to work the muscles from other pilates exercise DVDs I have tried. You really can feel the burn.  My only complaint is that the resistance band was not included with the DVD.,1442016000,2,231,4.634146341463414
5170620,2,B008NNY8MW,"By the time there was a warm up and cool down, there was actually only about one exercise per 10 minute segment. I love pilates and appreciate the attention to detail in the classes and longer DVDs, but I didn't feel like it fit well in a 10 minute format. Even if I did a few segments, each segment acted like a new one with warm up and cool down, so I would either have to do it or find a remote and that was a hassle.",1440806400,,420,3.839080459770115
5170621,5,B008NNY8MW,"Wow, what a great workout. The five sections feel more like 5 minutes each (an intense 5 minutes) than 10 minutes. I actually had to check the time. The bands really help with form and flexibility along with providing a fantastic resistance workout.

The band is light low resistance and is latex. I'll be replacing it soon but it's good enough for a start. Lara Hudson moves fluidly through all the moves with good instruction but at a pace that required me to pause a couple times to get the moves and use the band with correct form.

This is not for beginners, more for someone with intermediate or higher Pilates experience. I'd recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Pilates-for-Beginners/dp/B003QLEAQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Pilates for Beginners</a>&nbsp;as a good starting place. You can work your way up at your own pace.",1440806400,,919,5.75
5170622,5,B008NNY8MW,"I enjoy doing this cd daily. There's lots of pilates and toning in 10 minute segments. It's mostly done lying down or sitting on the mat. I use small weights instead of the band. The technology could last longer, so I'm thinking of eventually switching over to watching the digital copy.",1440633600,,287,4.647058823529412
5170623,5,B008NNY8MW,Who doesn't have 10 minute chunks of time for a quick workout? I love that you can do them individually or combine them. They seem simple and quick but it's definitely effective (if sore muscles the next day are any indication!).

5170624,5,B008NNY8MW,Great dvd I have never used a band before and was surprised at the resistance it creates if you don't have a lot of time it is very effective in a short period of time.,1439856000,,168,3.8285714285714287
5170625,5,B008NNY8MW,"This is a great DVD, especially for a beginner.  I like that the sections are only 10 minutes and I can do as many or as few as I want to.  The short segments makes it ideal for trying to get in a work out with kids running around!",1438214400,,231,3.693877551020408
5170626,5,B008NNY8MW,"I'm an intermediate/advanced exerciser, so I appreciate a challenge. This is my 3rd 10-min solution dvd from Lara, and I was pleasantly surprised at the intensity of this band workout. I thought, how hard can it be? Muscles ached in places that don't usually ache! I love the 10-min format so I can take a breath and reset. Lara's delivery is perfect. None of that sappy Pilates speak. I had a few issues with the band but I'm sure it'll ease up with repetition. Way to go Lara!",1436054400,2,478,4.443181818181818

5170630,5,B008NNY8MW,"I am a fan of Lara Hudson. I love her style of teaching pilates. This new video does not disappoint. Its easy to follow, yet tough and you get a great workout in a short amount of time. Pilates has been the only exercise i have ever been able to stick with and it really does shape and tone the body.

5170635,5,B008NNY8MW,I love the workout and have gone through three resistance bands and each time have had to buy the complete new DVD.  Is it possible to simply order a few of these bands.  The flex and length are specific to this routine.,1407369600,,220,4.214285714285714

SOOOOO disappointing!",1400803200,,152,4.8076923076923075
5170639,5,B008NNY8MW,I bought this video looking to bring my workout up a notch and boy did I get what I was looking for.  The band adds a great deal of intensity and her infusion of ballet with pilates created a unique spin making it unlike any of my other dvds.  If you looking for a total body burn that challenges your entire body press play for all five 10 minute sessions.  Some of the moves are pretty hard to do correctly so I would recommend watching the workout through before doing them for the first time. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.,1398902400,,538,4.203883495145631

5170641,3,B008NNY8MW,Cheap resistance band combined with awkward positions = FRUSTRATION. I'm sure the workouts would be better with a resistance band more like the one she is using. But even with that said the positions requiring to wrap it around your feet are nearly impossible with this trash resistance band. More frustrated at the end of this rather than the usual high I get from a good workout. Disappointed and dissatisfied.,1396396800,2,412,4.9
5170642,5,B008NNY8MW,Lara always has been one of my faves....this is an excellent DVD that's works you out...o love the band even though it can give you troubles at times,1394582400,,149,4.357142857142857
5170643,4,B008NNY8MW,"When I started working out again about three years ago, the first video I did regularly was the ""10 Minute Solution: Slim and Sculpt Pilates with Pilates Band"" starring Suzanne Bowen. I really enjoyed the 5 segment format, each segment focusing on a different area of the body, (i.e. abs/core, arms/upper, legs/lower, full body, stretch) and I love using the resistance band. The band is a great low-impact way to workout, and I noticed increased muscle tone/definition quickly, especially in my arms. Plus it's fun - kind of like playing with a toy while you're working out, and keeps me from getting bored. I've got an array of workout videos now, but I still go back to that one fairly regularly.

So, on to ""10 Minute Solution: Tighten & Tone Pilates"". I was familiar with Lara Hudson from a previous video, ""10 Minute Solution: Pilates"" (not too perky, she's definitely got a dancer's background and her transitions are very smooth) and was excited to see that this one incorporates the band (scarcer than regular pilates/yoga videos). I have a few workouts that use resistance bands, and I have a few bands of varying strengths that I rotate around. For this video, I started off using my medium-strength resistance band.

**NOTE: I did not order the actual DVD. I streamed this workout via Amazon Instant Video and used bands that I already had. So I have no opinion regarding the band that is included with the DVD. However, the bands that I use the most are ones that came with DVDs, so I feel safe in assuming that the one that comes with this workout is similar and of fine quality.

The medium band worked fine through the abs segment (stronger bands give extra support during ab work) but pretty soon after starting the second segment (legs/lower body) I switched to my least-resistant band. A lot of Lara's moves in this video are more complicated than most of the band exercises that I was used to or had done before. The majority of the moves (regardless of what segment you're doing) are full-body, where all four limbs use the band at the same time, instead of just your arm or just your leg. I really liked learning new ways to use the band, it was refreshing as well as challening - It's not a cardio workout by any means, but my heart rate was elevated throughout the four exercise segments.

However, there is definitely more opportunity for injury if you haven't used the resistance band much before. When I first started doing band workouts, I often strained the muscles in my neck, sometimes badly enough to where I couldn't turn my head one way or the other without sharp pain for a few days. It doesn't happen very much anymore, mainly because my abs are stronger than when I started and I've learned to use my core muscles to support my neck. But in this video almost every move involves doubling up on the band - holding both ends in your hands instead of one - which is good because it helps with stability, but it also means doubling the band resistance, and this makes arm moves particularly hard, and that's when it is easiest to strain your neck. There's also a lot of balance required for many movements, which without a base level of core strength would be difficult and possibly injurious. Therefore, I would not recommend this particular video for a resistance band rookie.

However, if you're familiar with pilates and with bands and are looking for another workout to add to your rotation then I this one is great. Like I said, I have a handful of resistance band workouts (10 Minute: Tone Trouble Zones with Amy Bento, Pilates Bodyband Challange with Ana Caban) and the individual exercises are really quite similar if not identical. But Lara has a lot of really fun moves that I had never done before. I just finished the whole video for the first time, so I will have to wait and see if and where I'll be sore tomorrow, but I definitely woke up some muscles that I hadn't been using that way before.",1391731200,17,3942,4.60968660968661
5170644,5,B008NNY8MW,"I use this DVD to start up my day. It is 5 diffrent workouts to chose from or do them all at once. I do 10 min. each day to start of. The workout it good and well explained how to do, so everyone can do it.",1391472000,,206,3.404255319148936
5170665,3,B008NNY8MW,While this DVD I believe will give you a good solid Pilates workout I did not enjoy it. I felt the band placement/use was awkward and I ended the workout frustrated which is not a feeling I'm used to when exercising. It just isn't worth it to me. I couldn't seem to keep the band in a good spot during the bridge series and having the band would around my ribs during a pli sequence was just uncomfortable. There are other better Pilates with the band workouts like Suzanne Bowens that I enjoy more.,1390348800,,499,4.319148936170213
5170666,2,B008NNY8MW,"I love Laura Hudson's 10 minute Solutions DVD's, but this one is not one of my favorites.  The Resistance band gets all bunched up and practically cuts off my circulation... her other DVD's are so much better. Don't waste your time on this one.",1389830400,,244,4.545454545454546
5170667,4,B008NNY8MW,"This is my first exercise experience with 10 Minute Solution and the workouts will make you sweat and leave your muscles sore. The band took some trial and error and kept slipping out of my hands at first. Once I got the hang of it, it is the best resistance and can even replace small hand weights. The timed segments are very convenient.",1386892800,2,339,4.396825396825397
5170668,5,B008NNY8MW,"I used to have pilates VHS tapes, so it's been awhile, and I am just now getting back into it with this DVD.  I like Lara Hudson, she very soothing, elegant and a great teacher.  I never really got into working with bands before (I always preferred weights) but I have to tell you that this workout with the band is challenging and I feel muscles working that I may not get fully with weights.  I'm thinking it has to do with the fluid movements and pulling the band to the full extent of each range of movement while stretching or twisting.

I did one of the Taebo 10 minute express workouts, the Abs, and then in the evening I did the tighten & tone the core section, I believe it was, and wow did it hurt on the teaser exercise I think it was called.  I must say that I hurt in places more internally within my ab muscles that I don't normally feel when I did the two on the same day.  I like to mix up my exercises so I am working different muscles and to keep from getting stagnated.  This is good stuff and I highly recommend this one with the band, it really does increase the toning benefits.  I will definitely be looking for another pilates dvd with a band workout.",1383696000,3,1175,4.168141592920354
5170669,4,B008NNY8MW,"I am a woman, but still a kid, and again, I have to say using the bands rather than dumbells for strength, legs, & abs has shown quicker results & is easier on the body.  I like parts of all of the 10 minute solutions I've bought overtime.  Mainly, for my abs, legs, & arms.  I find the dvd's, that focus on these 3 areas, & put together 6-10min. workouts(pick & choose workouts), (usually from 2 dvd's=60mins.). Do this 4 times a week, (break in middle of week, 1 day), than I do them for a month than switch to 2 new dvd's, repeating this 3 times = 90 days than start all over again w/ the 1st one.  I'm just starting on my 2nd 90 days (starting all over again).  We'll see what happens?  Happy so far;)",1379808000,2,705,4.072463768115942
5170670,5,B008NNY8MW,Excellent choice for people who need to exercise but don't have a lot of time. I personally like all of the 10 minute solution DVD  series because I like to customize my own workout or at least do  a segment or two when I don't really feel like working out I can at least do something. This DVD came with a resistance band included and the instructor is excellent and knowledgable .Excellent for Pilates lovers but this is not for beginners.,1377475200,2,441,4.432098765432099
5170671,5,B008NNY8MW,This Pilates DVD definitely did not disappoint! I started feeling the workout the next day. For only 10 minute workouts you definitely begin to feel the workout. I highly recommend this to any and all Pilates lovers out there.,1369785600,2,226,4.82051282051282
5170672,5,B008NNY8MW,"I love the 10 minute solution pilates DVDs so i was chuffed when this one came out. I thoroughly enjoyed the workouts and the fact the resistance band came with it was a bonus. Unfortunately the band snapped within a month of buying the DVD and I am unable to buy another that is long enough for the exercises on the DVD. So now the DVD is gathering dust, which is a great shame.",1367280000,3,379,4.135135135135135
5170673,5,B008NNY8MW,"This DVD is certainly not for beginners, but if you're familiar with Pilates moves and are looking for a challenge- I highly recommend this video. I've been doing a few of Laura Hudson's other 10 Minute Solution Pilates and Yoga DVD's regularly (4-5 times per week) for a little over a month, and this DVD was still a major challenge, my first attempt at doing the exercises I was not able to do all reps. With regular practice, I expect to see great results from this DVD- I felt the burn in most segments within the first 5 minutes.",1366934400,5,534,4.404040404040404
5170674,5,B008NNY8MW,"it is easy to follow,and it makes you workout harder using the band. i highly recommend it for all ages and levels.",1365638400,,115,4.2727272727272725
8529152,4,B008NNY8MW,Great pilates exercise DVD. Love the band that comes with it. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners.,1524960000,,100,4.9411764705882355

8529154,5,B008NNY8MW,"I have four other ""10 Minute Solution Pilates"" DVDs, two of which are with Lara Hudson. This is the most challenging Pilates DVD I own, in a great way! Lara is a great instructor and is easy to follow. I have one other Pilates DVD that uses a band and it was not my favorite just because I found it cumbersome at times to try to keep up while using the band. The first time I did this DVD I felt a little behind because obviously all the moves were new and it was slightly time consuming to adjust the band in time with Lara. But I anticipate after doing this a few times I will have no problem keeping up. I am very happy I purchased this DVD, it has renewed my confidence in being able to do Pilates with a band.

The ""total body"" segment in this DVD is particularly challenging and fun. It has mostly standing exercises which are my favorite total body workouts.

If you are on the fence about this DVD or Pilates in general, I highly recommend trying it! You will love Lara's instruction and notice a physical difference after only a few weeks of doing these exercises.",1513296000,,1073,4.254901960784314
8529155,5,B008NNY8MW,"I love this instructor, she explains everything so methodically and keeps you moving.  I would say it is for all levels.",1493942400,,120,4.714285714285714

8529157,5,B008NNY8MW,All  (5) of them are great easy to keep up with  seems to help the body tone and trim down  in every way this dvd is made for people of all ages stick with it long enough and you also will become flexible.,1486339200,,205,3.7209302325581395
8529158,5,B008NNY8MW,Very effective workout. Tires my arms but in a good way.,1482364800,,56,4.181818181818182
8529159,4,B008NNY8MW,"These workouts move quickly, so if you have a problem working with the band - if it sticks or slips - you'll miss a bit of the workout.  Other than that, it's definitely worth the time in the morning.  I appreciate the ability to design your own workout by selecting any of the sessions, in any order you decide.",1474243200,,312,4.271186440677966
8529160,3,B008NNY8MW,"This is definitely NOT a beginner DVD and she goes so fast that you don't even have time to properly set up the band and position before she is moving on. I also feel that some of her moves are so quick that she puts you in danger of injuring yourself. While a good, tough workout, she is trying to cram so much that you really need to be careful.",1473292800,,347,3.9714285714285715
8529161,5,B008NNY8MW,"Great, challenging workout. The resistance bands definately give you both support, and make the muscles you are targeting, work!",1472774400,,128,5.7894736842105265
