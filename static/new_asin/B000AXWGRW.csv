8080240,5,B000AXWGRW,One of my favorite stories about how perseverance with a gentle hand succeeds in the end.  Amy Madigan is wonderful as the patient mother.  A peek into a wife's role (once upon a time) without making her look pathetic or bitter.,1445644800,,228,4.536585365853658

8080243,3,B000AXWGRW,"Adam Penn is only concerned about increasing his livestock, making sure the farm chores are done and that his new barn is built. He loves his wife Sarah but she is only a woman. He has to do her thinking for her. He is after all the father, provider and man of the house who will take care all of her needs.
  For nineteen years, Sarah has been the uncomplaining wife and mother. She had Adam's children, milked their cows and watched as he built the various sheds and barns on their land while the space in their house got smaller and smaller. When Adam decides to build a barn without consulting her and then deliberately dismisses her wishes when she tries to talk with him something begins to snap.
  Mary Freeman's dramatized story, The Revolt of Mother, shows what happens when two wills clash. Set in the late nineteenth century, the story focuses on the relationship of a farm couple who have their own separate needs. When one always dominates another two things may happen. The other spouse may become more submissive or resentful. Adam and Sarah's relationship plays itself out as we see what happens when their desires come into conflict.
  From a cinematic and acting point of view, The Revolt of Mother, ranks as average. You will not be overwhelmed by the scenery nor enthralled over the acting. This is an average movie to be enjoyed at home. Thus the actors give an average performance. The strength of the movie lies in the message of the story itself which is a mirror of all to many one sided relationships. To witness this happening in another time period further sheds light on how a husband and wife should treat one another and how men and women should relate to each other. In such a case this brief film and story is a winner in touching our hearts and souls.",1024704000,3,1785,4.545171339563863
