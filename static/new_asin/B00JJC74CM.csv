Not only does she clearly explain the lovely prop that is the fan, Madame Onca shows great technique, tips on conveying the emotion behind the prop and a fun combinations of movements to create a short choreography. I also really liked the interview and performance at the end of the DVD! It was filmed in a new way that I found refreshing in an instructional DVD.
