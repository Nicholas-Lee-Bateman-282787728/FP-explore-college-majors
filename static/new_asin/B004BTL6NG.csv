4320550,4,B004BTL6NG,"I have, throughout my life, treasured the true story of Elsa, the Adamson's and of the offspring Elsa never got to raise.  I even skipped school to see the movie, daily, in our city for 2 weeks.
Many people never seem to realize the fight or struggles that the Adamson's endured with their plight in preserving wildlife and more so the challenge of getting Elsa back into her free heritage.  George's murder, like Dian Fossey years later, depicted the ruthless diplomatic and political controversies they were challenged with as well as with the tribes who had yet other ulterior motives.
Bill Travers, who depicted George Adamson in the movies 'Born Free' and 'Living Free', son is an honorary chair to the BORN FREE USA Foundation which is trying to keep wildlife where it belongs......in the wilds and not in zoos; circuses;
research labs and heaven forbid, our own back yard. site can be found at: [...] Free USA.com
For everyone who has never seen Elsa....I would recommend getting all the titles and bring her, her cubs and the Adamson's into your lives.  I know there was, or is still another edition of the 'Free' collection...Forever Free as I saw it in my teen years in book format, I believe. Along with the Adamson's, 'Born Free', 'Living Free', Bill Travers can also be seen in 'Ring of Bright Water'; and you can also view Dian Fossey's fight over the mountain gorillas in 'Gorilla's in the Mist'
Yes, Elsa.....thank you for the memories, the tears and joys we encountered but your return to the wilds would set the stage for many years to come...",1297123200,12,1561,4.731617647058823
4320551,5,B004BTL6NG,"As the eldest son of Virginia McKenna and the late Bill Travers - and as CEO of Born Free USA and The Born Free Foundation - I found it hard to watch Elsa's Legacy: The Born Free Story since it touched on so many issues that lie close to my heart. The footage of the old days, the extracts from George's diaries, clips from the movie (Born Free), all these resonated terrifically with me as I recalled the year spend in Kenya while my parents (who portrayed Joy and George) worked on the film. The legacy of those days, so wonderfully told in the PBS show, is a profound message - that wild animals do not belong in zoos but should be permitted to live wild and free. Today, this lies at the heart of what Born Free does all around the world. The deprivation and suffering imposed on wild animals in so many zoos, the crude animal exploitation of the circus, the (frankly) madness of keeping wild animals as 'pets', are issues that we must challenge, expose and bring to an end with every ounce of our compassionate soul. Joy, George, Virginia and Bill have set our moral compass for the future when it comes to our relationship with wild animals. We must do all in our power - supported by growing numbers of compassionate people all around the world - to concentrate our efforts, our money and our dedication on protecting wild animals in wild places for, without them, we shall end up with zoos - perhaps we'll call them 'living museums' - where a few hundred carefully-selected species will exist to remind us of what we once had and what we lost. The wild is the conservation front line. It is where we must take a stand. Elsa's Legacy is the change of mind-set that Born Free (the book, the film, the Nature TV show and now the two organisations I have the honour to serve) have brought into sharp focus. I invite everyone who cares to join us by going to the Born Free USA website and  becoming part of the next chapter in this amazing story. Thank you. Will",1295222400,84,1965,4.398351648351649
4320552,1,B004BTL6NG,"Last year, the BBC produced an excellent 60-minute show titled, ""The Born Free Legacy"". It was an excellent look at George and Joy Adamson and their pioneering work with animals, most notably (of course) Elsa the lioness. It lived up to its title of describing the world-changing effects ""Born Free"" has had. One of the most striking visual examples was of pictures children sent to Dr. Desmond Morris--before Born Free, children saw lions as creatures behind bars, unhappy and fierce. After Born Free, they started drawing lions as happy animals living on vast plains. (None of this is in the 50-minute, completely altered PBS version of this show titled Elsa's Legacy.)

I have serious doubts about whether whoever scripted the PBS show ever read the book Born Free, or saw the movie. Repeatedly throughout the show, Born Free is referred to as a ""fairy tale"" and a ""myth"". What is going on here?

The PBS show also has a fascination with death, spending a long time on Virginia McKenna visiting Elsa's grave, and on an emotional re-telling of George Adamson's murder and funeral. But what's most amazing is that PBS's version says practically nothing about the ""legacy"" mentioned in the title.

The BBC show, ""The Born Free Legacy"", not only does not have these faults, it is overall a more realistic and compelling telling of the events that began over 50 years ago and continue to shape the world today.

If the BBC ever releases ""The Born Free Legacy"" on DVD, THAT is the version of this show that is worth watching.",1294790400,43,1522,4.797709923664122
4320553,5,B004BTL6NG,"This is a most fascinating glimpse into the lives of George and Joy Adamson after Elsa came into their lives.  The highlights are actual film footage of Elsa that the Adamsons shot at various stages of Elsa's life, including after her return to the wild.  This is a must have, especially if you own the Born Free DVD.

It's an hour filled with laughter and tears.",1294704000,23,363,4.46969696969697
4320554,5,B004BTL6NG,"This is the Blue Ray version of the documentary which is worth every penny. A documentary that brings the reality that wildlife has lost ground to humans and will lose ground as time passes. Humans need for space will leave this BLUE PLANET an emptiness that I wonder if life would worth living without wildlife in the next century.

Born Free was FIRST a book __sold 25 million copies in first year, printed in 25 languages__ and then SECOND a film that changed forever the way we think about wildlife. You will witness the real story of the Adamson's' life with Elsa (1956-1961), the lioness cub, one of three cubs when George had to kill their mother lion in self defense.  Their diaries, home movies and detailed records reveal an intimate look into their pioneering work and unique relationship with lions and leave US with a new appreciation for the world of animals we never knew until Elsa and Born Free opened our eyes in 1966. Since then 90% of the lions have disappeared due to human activities. You will see Africa like it meant to be, wild and free which makes this documentary a must see if you have any appreciation for caring humans, wildlife and BLUE PLANET. This is the real deal; the movie is not since it does not portray the real relationship of Adamsons. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1442966400,,1297,4.6103896103896105

4320559,5,B004BTL6NG,"If you are familiar with ""Born Free"", whether you read the book, saw the movie or both, this documentary will finally close the last chapter on this fascinating story. Even the re-enactments are flawless (and I'm not a big fan of them). But the original film footage and stills of the Adamsons and the lions is mesmerizing. The fact that Virginia McKenna (Joy Adamson in the movie) narrates and stars in this documentary is what really makes it worthwhile. Her personal perspective and involvement with this story is what makes it so special. The quality of the Blu-ray is as good as it gets. I've watched it three times since I purchased it. Now I'm waiting for ""Born Free"" to be released in Blu-ray as well.",1402358400,4,709,4.634920634920635

4320563,5,B004BTL6NG,"How I cried when Born Free came out in the movie theaters!  I have always thought animals were so much more than we gave them credit.  Our Creator doesn't make junk!!  Such a beautiful story about the love of Elsa for Joy and George and vice versa!  Animals are sooo wonderful and intelligent and can teach us so much if we would only stop abusing them and killing them out of greed and our sick sense of being above all creation!  We are NOT!  As the Native American teaches us...we are all connected to earth and to each other.  We are small compared to the whole of life and we must make room for all creatures and respect and learn about them.  I love all creatures and have all of my life!  God bless all people like Joy and George Adamson who love them, too, and help us learn just how special Creator made them all!!  we have no right to destroy that which we did not create!",1365206400,,882,4.196428571428571
