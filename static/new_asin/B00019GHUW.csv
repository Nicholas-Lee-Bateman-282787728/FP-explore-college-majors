8008665,3,B00019GHUW,"Transfer quality of ECHO BRIDGE 4 movie sets is quite good, although film stock is not always in the best of condition. A bargain price also makes these small collections attractive. All titles are contained on a single disc.

This edition offers the best ""mad doctor"" assistant since Frankenstein's Fritz, plus a young Jack Nicholson clashing with an old Boris Karloff in a creepy castle, backwoods Georgia zombies, and Chris Lee's last go-round as the famous vampire.

SYNOPSES for ""Horror Classics V.9""--

DEAD MEN WALK--  George Zucco plays twin brother physicians-- one good, one evil. The sinister one returns from the grave as a vampire out for revenge on the sibling responsible for his demise. This doctor's creepy assistant is played by Dwight Frye. He performed a similar role in the 1931 classic, FRANKENSTEIN. Silent film comedian Al St. John has a cameo as the man who finds Kate's body.

MUTANT--  Two brothers discover that toxic waste is transforming the residents of a backwater Georgia town into night prowling carnivorous zombies.

THE SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA--  This last of several Lee/Cushing Dracula movies is set in present-day (1970's) London, where the immortal vampire has plans to unleash a deadly virus on the world. For this go-round, Mrs. Van Helsing is played by leggy Joanna Lumley, of AVENGERS and AB/FAB fame.

THE TERROR--  Roger Corman partly directed this nightmarish and somewhat confusing tale of a French Army officer who follows a beautiful woman to a creepy castle owned by a creepier old Baron. Does the girl really transform into a raven? Is the Baron exactly who he says he is? Are the eccentric villagers misleading our curious lieutenant, and why isn't he with his men?  Wouldn't YOU like to know!

8008666,4,B00019GHUW,"To Me, the transfer of ""Satinic rites..."" is great.  It seems to be really letterboxed.  There is no hiss.  The colors are vibrant.  There are no artifacts.  Compared to an Alpha copy I had this is a ten.

Many people think this is a weak Hammer film.  I disagree.  It is very entertaining.",1103587200,,290,4.339622641509434
