1922159,4,B0000DBJ9P,"Suffice to say, I have seen many and varied ""rock"" concerts in my 41 years.  This, however, was MY best!  This despite the fact that we had upper balcony seats.  The only reason I did not give this DVD a 5 star rating is that there was not enough prolonged footage of the full stage.  You miss some of the pleasure of watching the simultaneous  interaction of the performers.  For example, The green silhouetted AOL-ish type figures, in and amongst the band, during The Current were amazing when seen as a whole, from the audiences point of view.  Also, the line of percussionists were mesmerizing to watch as they pummeled their kits.  Especially when the parts of a song featured their playing in almost choreographed unison.  I am generally not a fan of showy guitarist, but these three guys genuinely and unpretensiously rocked!  The overall energy of the entire band was an evening constant and was awe inspiring.  We had bought tickets for my  Mom & Dad (for his b-day) several months in advance.  I new little of the BMG and was not really thrilled to be going the night of this (I believe) the last show of the tour, in Grand Prarie.  I was merely expecting some mild ""performance art"" entertainment and nothing more.  We dutifully arrived on time, but the horrendous parking situation caused us to miss the opening acts (Venus Hum & Tracy Bonham).  When the show started I immediately began smiling and could tell this was going to be an enchanted evening indeed!  When the show concluded, I turned to M'Lady and declared that it was the best concert I had ever seen to date.  The DVD captures the show almost perfectly.  I do regret that White Rabbit was not able to be included (I wonder why?).  I guess I'll have to get the Compex CD for that one.  As for Piano Smasher, we at least get to see a lttle smashin' during Baba O'Riley.  Overall, highly recommended.",1072569600,,1873,4.578313253012048
1922160,5,B0000DBJ9P,"This DVD does a great job of capturing The Complex Tour.  I saw two shows on the tour, both in LA.  The only drawback is that Piano Smasher and White Rabbit had to be cut from the DVD because they didn't come out well on camera.
On the techical side of things... The menus are very creative.  The 5.1 surround mix samples on side B of the disc sound great.  It has both Dolbly Digital and DTS.  The concert itself is in stereo and Dolbly Digital.  A small complaint is that the DVD is aimed at the standard 4:3 TV viewers.  The concert appears to be widescreen, but it is technically just a letterboxed fullscreen, instead of anamorphic widescreen.",1070668800,2,648,4.394957983193278
1922161,5,B0000DBJ9P,"I got tickets for my husband as an early Christmas present, and since he wouldn't want to go alone, for myself too.  The show was incredible.  This DVD is our souvenier and we were transported in time to the concert when we watched it.  My ONLY complaints are that it didn't sound as good as the live show even through a really good stereo system with subwoofer - BUT it was still very good if you like a lot of bass.  It seemed the bass was good and the vocals but you don't notice the great guitar work in the background as much.  It still sounds great though.  My other complaint is that the people at the Texas concert where the DVD was filmed may have gotten ripped off, there is a song on the Complex album (which is phenomenal!!!) called Piano Smasher.  It wasn't on the DVD but it is my husband's favorite and we really enjoyed it live.  The cover of White Rabbit was also not on the DVD.  If they performed it at the Texas concert, then it must have been left off the DVD because of time constraints.  There are 5 videos on the DVD.  One is with Dave Matthews, same as the vocals on the album.  I'm a fan of DMB but my husband is NOT.  Peter Moore is the vocalist in the concert and I thought he did a much better job on the song than Dave Matthews did.  Peter Moore did many of the songs and he is great.  Tracy Bonham was fantastic too.  She is a tiny thing with an enormous voice.  There is another video called Exhibit 13 that is a haunting tribute to Sept 11.  Very nicely done.  There are 5 songs on it that are in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround.  There will be a re-release in 2004 of the Complex album in 5.1 also.  We will be owning that too!  This is my favorite concert DVD, for the music, the visual and dancing!  My 4 yr old and 8 month old daughters love the music and visual of it.  They are the toughest critics too.",1070668800,11,1837,4.095505617977528
1922162,5,B0000DBJ9P,"I saw this show in person; this DVD is very true to the production we saw live, which is to say nothing but the best.  If you're curious about BMG, and you're too much of a tightwad to go see them in Vegas (drool), consider grabbing this DVD.",1070582400,3,242,4.041666666666667
1922163,5,B0000DBJ9P,"I received my copy of this yesterday and didn't leave my TV for quite a while. Everyone should buy this DVD. I have seen Blue Man Group twice. Once in Boston in a small venue, very intimate and an enormous amount of fun and this past summer I was fortunate to see them at the Mann Music Center, an open air theatre in Philadelphia doing this tour.
I had been raving about Blue Man since I saw them in Boston some 7 years ago and managed to talk my wife and a family friend into going. They were not disappointed in any way and my wife even commented how it was the best show she had been too since she saw King Crimson back in the 80's.
After seeing the original show in Boston, I was somewhat curious how they were going to translate it into a much larger production, but they did it. When I saw the DVD out there, I was curious how they would be able to transfer the incredible thing I had seen live onto a DVD format for a small screen but they did that too!
If you were not fortunate (or in contact with your real self... ) enough to have caught this tour, this is an excellent way to see who and what Blue Man Group are. This DVD is amazingly entertaining and great for the whole family. Tons of sight gags (the Blue Men don't speak), interesting instruments made of PVC pipe, not to mention the piano smash (a piano shell with a few tuned strings inside they hit with a large mallet), day glo and in some cases lighted costumes (Venus Hum wears a dress that flashes different colors), an incredible stage show, no less than 4 percussionists as well as the Blue Men themselves... this DVD takes multimedia to a level not seen yet. Those who know the Blue men from  other venues will also see some staples of the Blue Man show such as the flourescent paints in the toms on either side of the stage and of curse, the exploratory antics of the Blue Men who seem as though they are just discovering everything.
The music is some of the best industrial type stuff I've heard period. And yes, that's a real anvil.
I highly recommend this DVD if you haven't figured that out. This will be one of my prize ones.",1070323200,6,2108,4.217821782178218
1922164,5,B0000DBJ9P,"This was such an amazing show live that I have already secured the DVD. The Energy, Movements, Presence on stage make these performers a true pleasure to see! You will not be let down at all. You are part of the show and they make sure that you know it! The percussion made a large part of the show but the Blue Men sealed the deal.
Buy It, Watch it, Enjoy it",1069200000,,359,4.0
1922165,5,B0000DBJ9P,"This DVD will get ""Your Attention"" completely. The show has been amazing, having been to several performances of their Complex Rock tour, I have truly been blown away. The amount of energy and music made during the show can barely be captured on film, but this DVD does an amazing job. If you missed the biggest Rock tour of 2003 pick up this DVD, you won't regret it.",1067558400,7,368,4.426470588235294
1922166,5,B0000DBJ9P,"Having seen the stage show twice in Las Vegas (each was a trip!), seeing the live concert show was on par with the Vegas show.  Visually stimulating and sonically overwhelming.  I traveled 3 hrs to see this show (and I NEVER do that) and was not disappointed. I think that everyone should see a Blue Man Group performance of some type. This tour was brilliant.",1067472000,,360,4.523076923076923
1922167,5,B0000DBJ9P,"If this dvd is anything like the concert itself. It will be the best purchase you have ever made in music and entertainment. The Blue Man Group is a must see show with Theater, Comedy, Music, Creative, and Audience participation that you is out of this world.

1922198,3,B0000DBJ9P,"I really like the Album version of The Complex, which I have on DVD-Audio.  The music is infectious and the sound quality and surround sound are superb.  I bought the DVD of the rock tour live version because I wanted to see more and looked forward to a different performance.  The concert DVD is a lot of fun.  But the sound quality is bad enough that watching it once is enough--I will go back to the DVD-Audio disc for future listening.  The image quality is OK, decent DVD quality video of of a live performance, live to video.  But I have to believe that the sound recording quality is a lot better than what is available on the DVD, which sounds like mp3--but then that is mostly what you get for DVD sound quality.

I would immediately buy this again if it were issued again on blu-ray if the sound quality were upgraded.  High resolution blu ray soundtracks can be every bit as good as DVD-Audio or SACD and much better than CD.  Even if the video image quality were not improved at all, with a good high definition soundtrack, a blu ray of this concert performance would be on my immediate ""MUST BUY"" list.",1478390400,,1115,4.4

1922224,5,B0000DBJ9P,"I had no idea it was going to be a rock concert when I went. How pleased I was. This was the best thing I had seen since 1984 when Zappa last toured with an 18 piece band. Everything was top notch, the music, the lyrics, the performance, the humor. I took my 9 year old daughter and she was floored. The light show alone must have cost over 2 million dollars. Everything about it was brilliant. I want to go again, but I have been able to minimize the craving by watching the DVD.

If you're after a flat recording of what they can do, this is the disc for you. Big drums - don't sound big. The dynamic range is as near zero as you can get and still have sound.

1922238,3,B0000DBJ9P,"I really like Blue Man Group, having seen them live twice.  This DVD, while entertaining, is disappointing in terms of the picture and sound quality.  The editing also leaves something to be desired.  You see the Blue Men and the performers doing things that are not in sync with the music.  Yeah, I know; that's a pretty nit-picky knock against this DVD, but it really does take away from the whole experience.  I would highly recommend that anyone thinking about buying this video rent it first -- and you may also want to rent ""Blue Man Group -- How to Be a Megastar Live"" before you buy.  That video is a lot better IMHO.  For those who have never seen Blue Man Group, you should know that this DVD is not the typical Blue Man Group show.  There are no funny skits in this video -- it's all about music, percussion, and the Blue Men learning how to create the ultimate rock concert experience.  There are some bright spots in this video that are not in the Blu-Ray though, like the guest appearances of Helen Bonham and Venus Hum.  It's just too bad they couldn't have pressed this performance to Blu-Ray...",1444003200,,1111,4.482587064676617

The sound quality is excellent, the creativity is off the charts and the music rocks!  This is the one Blue Man Group DVD that you must have - I've bought others but they don't approach this one from a musical creativity standpoint.  These guys are true artists in every sense of the word.  It's hard to choose a favorite from all of the songs on this, but ""The Current"" hits on all cylinders: artistic presentation, lyrics & meaning, lighting, delivery ... everything.  New viewers at our place will often argue with us about whether the stick figure guys that are lit up in some of the songs are computer animations or actual people.  Watch closely and you'll see they're actual people - on stage anyway!  When they climb the ladders back up from the ""underground"" they may in fact be something else.

The video isn't bad if you have never seen the BMG before and wonder who, what they are and what they do. For that purpose the video is quite watchable.

1922320,5,B0000DBJ9P,"Friends know of my love of music, so when it comes to birthdays or Christmas I commonly get CDs or music DVDs as presents. This Christmas brought a Blue Man Group DVD: ""The Complex Rock Tour LIVE."" I've enjoyed it  a couple times already.

The Blue Man Group, if you haven't already heard (and who hasn't?), consists of three guys with shiny blue plastic-looking heads, except for the white eyes and teeth. Basically, they're quite good percussionists and they dance and play a variety of very strange percussion instruments, including a piano turned over on it's side (it's played with a large sledge-hammer-like mallet). I've seen them a couple times on TV, but it's been a long time ago. In this live DVD performance, the Blue Man group is up front and facing a large audience (perhaps 10,000 or so) with a backing band to their rear. The band consists of about three or four guitar/bass guitar players, perhaps three or four drummers/percussionists, two keyboards players and at least four singers. The backup band is on an elaborate highly lighted upraised stage. The band and singers are quite excellent, together with the stunning light show, and are worthwhile watching in themselves. I'd almost say that Annette Stean's version of the song ""I Feel Love"" is worth the price of the DVD. What a set of pipes that young lady has! Meanwhile, the Blue Man Group are vigorously playing their percussion instruments in the foreground. Both the Blue Man Group and the band are highly animated and quite excellent at the 14 songs they present. It's a pleasant concert. The live audience obviously enjoyed it immensely and DVD viewers should enjoy it likewise. The sound is excellent and comes out quite well on a good stereo system (turn it up!).

The concert itself is arranged around a set of instructions as to how to give/enjoy a successful rock concert. Some of the suggestions are quite humorous, and some tongue in cheek. As the concert proceeds, the instructions are unfolded in between songs. Interesting concept and well staged. It's a fine concert. It's loaded with very good music played by very capable musicians and with an elaborate visual scene. Bravo!

Great visuals and awesome rock!",1316131200,,132,4.5
1922322,3,B0000DBJ9P,"Whenever I've seen the Blue Man Group before - several times on TV and once in person - I've always been impressed by their whimsicality, creativity, humor, and kinetic motion.  Any group that can get my 76 year old mother to take some of the toilet paper that streamed from the rafters and wear it around her head like a bandana must have a live show that rocks!

THE GOOD
As always, it's fun to see the Blue Man Group themselves, and their percussion on a bunch of tubes is always enjoyable.  Their self-referential parody of rock concerts in general is a very clever idea, and the audience participation, even on DVD is infectious.  They had a number of sequences (the cell phone bit, the tribute to music, the list of obligatory rock moves, etc.) that had the whole family moving and laughing.

THE BAD
I saw this same Complex Rock Tour live in London in 2006, and it was much, much better than this DVD.  Maybe after 4 years they'd had a chance to perfect the show more.  The main problem with this DVD version is that there is much, too much of the back up band and guest singers, and much too little of the Blue Man Group themselves.

The music itself, for the most part, was very repetitive and not very interesting.  What most of us want to see is the Blue Man Group themselves.  Every time the spotlight was on them, and not the humongous backup band or guest singer, we all paid more attention and enjoyed the show a lot more.  I wish the show had featured the Blue Man Group more.

Some of the best bits from the live show I saw in 2007 weren't even on this DVD.  In their place was, you guessed it, more head banging music from the backup band.

All in all, the family enjoyed it, but not nearly as much as I thought we would.  Live tickets are kind of pricey - but they're definitely worth it!",1302220800,,1807,4.289085545722714

Watching the concert in HD is such an improvement. The light show is far superior, the music tighter and more refined. Sound is slightly better. Their new female vocalist Adrian Hartley projects her outstanding voice better than the Complexes guest vocalists. Megastar also has a Ace of a cut playing Pink Floyd's One Of These Days. It is one awesome over the top rocker that might make you say, Blue Floyd Rocks, Pink who?
Last comment, HD TV is like looking out a clean window, while the old tv is like looking out a very dirty window. If you can afford one buy it. Blue Man Group Rocks! Megastar 5 Stars The Complex 4 Stars.",1223337600,,759,4.270833333333333
1922357,5,B0000DBJ9P,"Blue Man Group is a strange experience, I suppose. It's as much theater as rock band, but then what great band isn't as much theater as rock?

This DVD shows a concert tour the group did, rather than a Las Vegas show. So, it's a performance from band to audience, and not so much a comedy and audience involvement show as they would do in Sin City or elsewhere. As such, it's a lot of fun to watch and listen to, and is not likely to grow old with repeated watching.

I'm not going to dwell on each song or particular aspects of the show, other than to say that their performance of Baba O'Reilly is one of the best rock performances recorded, ever, by anyone. That cut alone is worth the price of the DVD. It will astonish you that they can pull it off live. It will rock you from head to toe. I would have bought just that song on a DVD and been perfectly satisfied. It's that good.

The Complex-Rock Tour LIve by the Blue Man Group is an admirable attempt at bringing their terrific live experience to the VERY small screen.  These incredibly talented people show why they fill up venues all over the USA.

I noticed that some of the story seems to be absent.  I have been to only one Blue Man Group concert, and there was a very definite tale being told with musical interludes.  Those story line fill parts seem to be missing on the DVD, which makes it a little more like JUST a concert, rather then the artful, multi-media experience of the live show.

Also the rock concert habit of focusing on a single musician really detracts from the show.  Arguably one of their best and most well received songs is ""I Feel Love"" and we barely get to see the high speed percussion ""switch off"" that is occuring with the Blue Men, since the camera is focused mostly on the singer.

Still as an intro or a reminder of a Blue Man show it is an impressive effort, I would just like to see some more of their ingenuity applied to the DVD.",1168300800,,1087,4.4

But if you're expecting more of the whimsical, connected kind of humor you got from the Andrew Wyeth painting sketch (Remember? the one with the Twinkies?), you can forget it.  The ""Rock Star"" program is very light on blue men and extremely long on group.  The blue guys showed up this time just to front an overly loud band in a long program of sound-alike car crash impressions.  And they abdicate nearly a third of the show to clever but pointless video animations that seem to go on forever.

There are a couple of redeeming moments.  The blue heads in the TV monitors for the bit about escaping Planet Earth is classic Blue Man.  But save yourself some money and a lot of ear pain by searching for it online and watching it on your computer.

However, if you have not seen BMG Live, and you are looking for a representation of a performance that made this group famous, do not buy this DVD.  Please put your money towards seeing them live in one of their non-musical performances, which I wish were available on DVD, but is not likely to happen until they are unable to draw large crowds to see them live. Don't hold your breath. They are awesome live. I am not happy with the artistic expansion in to the ""music"" area, I suppose because the performances that made them famous are just pure artistic genius.  This IMHO is quite commercial

I'd be better able to review the DVD if I'd seen a performance of The Complex Rock Tour in person; I suspect there's an impact to the experience the DVD can only hint at. That being said, I found the DVD engrossing if slightly schizoid - and I don't meant that last in a bad way.

BMG forces an audience to suspend expectations - you can never be sure what BMG is doing, or how it will turn out. But, along the way they provide moments of magic, wonder, and even some thumping good tunes. Exhibit 13, one of the scenes from the DVD, is incredibly poignant.

1922528,5,B0000DBJ9P,"Confound your audience. Ready. Go. The seemingly crazed offspring of a Mime troupe, Kraftwerk, and Pink Floyd, the Blue Man Group presents a dazzling combination of childlike innocence, cute `n' cuddly wackiness, vaguely unsettling weirdness, and pretty damn fine rock music!

For instance, the two guitarists in the touring band have the Pete Townsend ""windmill"" completely nailed for their incendiary rendition of The Who's ""Baba O'Reiley"" (aka Teenage Wasteland) - I wouldn't have been in the least surprised to have seen them smash said axes to pieces at the end! - and they may even have invented a new musical genre, Metal Disco, with their killer take on Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love;"" vocals courtesy of Venus Hum.

But like Floyd you go to ""see,"" and not just listen to, the Blue Men, and in this respect they definitely do NOT disappoint! Over the years I've been to some of the biggest, most complex - no pun intended! - rock shows ever staged; performances by Floyd, Genesis, and Yes spring to mind. And while you can always pile on more lasers, more smoke, build a wall, and even crash a plane onto the stage, the sheer joyous inventiveness of the Blue Men's show takes some beating!

Consider the concept; ""The Complex Rock Tour"" is presented to us as an instructional, interactive seminar on how to be a ""Rock Star,"" with us, the audience, being both in on, and the butt of, the joke! You simply can't help but smile as you see the Blue's react with childlike wonder upon discovering a fiber optic camera hidden inside the guts of their signature, ""tubular,"" instrument stack, then seeing themselves live on the screen behind the band. Watching their bemused expressions as the audience goes nuts watching them trying to follow the ""instructions"" and become fully-fledged ""Rock Stars"" also induces fits of laughter, and rueful head shaking.

The satirical commentary on the modern music business is scathing, such as telling them that they can overcome any shortcomings in singing or instrument playing by simply concentrating on their hip-swiveling choreography! Similarly, once they've made it as ""Rock Stars"" they're informed that they should knock out a couple of tribute numbers to previous rockers, that way the fans won't realize what a bunch of ""callous and delusional asses"" they've become!!! Oh my goodness, how many so-called ""Stars"" do those two particular pieces of advice remind you of?!?!?! LOL!!!

The visual presentation of the show is breathtaking, but don't worry, musically, the Blue Men deliver the goods in spectacular fashion. Highlights for me are the opening instrumental ""Above,"" the bouncy and subversive ""Sing Along,"" ""The Current,"" used in ""Terminator 3"" - and as I mentioned above - the incendiary ""Teenage Wasteland"" and killer ""I Feel Love,"" as well as the haunting minimalism of ""Exhibit 13.""

As other reviewers have said, the production of this DVD is not perfect, it is an amalgam of two separate performances after all, but what you have here certainly captures the spirit of the Blue Men, albeit in a different format to their established shows. I simply can't recommend this highly enough... a unique production, it certainly makes me want to rush off to Vegas to see them ASAP! And two final pieces of advice; listen to this very L O U D, and do watch the ""About the DVD"" chapter... it's a hoot! Thank You Good Night.",1119916800,3,3371,4.936507936507937

Then, after hearing the DTS 5.1 mixes of three songs from the studio album ""The Complex"", I went out and bought the DVD-Audio versions of ""The Complex"" and ""Audio"". (Both of these are compatable with DVD-Video systems!!)  If you've never heard music in full 5.1 Surround you are in for a treat!

The BMG are nothing short of addictive - and this DVD ROCKS.  You will laugh very hard, you will find yourself dancing (I dare anyone to keep up RM #3 for long) and your mouth will drop at some of the AMAZING performances during this show by both guests and the BMG.

From a journey that explores our isolation in office cubes and society in general to a beautiful tribute to 9/11 to short comic skits (the rock manual encourages the blue men to do something to make their appearances stand out, LOL) to an intense performance of The Who's Baba O'Reily - with Tracy Bonham practically burning up her violin - you will witness a concert like no other.

It's nothing like a show you'd see in one of the regular venues - but it is nonetheless intense as they explore the ""Rock Movements"" so cliche' with any touring rock band.

The critic from Uruguay is wrong in his claim that it's not sophisticated. In his defense it is easy to get caught up in the novelty and comedy of the show and miss things--much like the audience members who shout out inappropriately at the end of ""Exhibit 13""--a moving albeit not fully credited tribute to the victims of September 11.  Sure, Blue Man Group can be enjoyed just for their wackiness and some good rock music played by a terrific band.  But they are so much more than just grown-up Smurfs--the Complex Rock Tour is a real emotional voyage, and the Blue Men, for all their strangeness, are us.  They're lost and perplexed in a complex (!) world, and as they make their way through it, they become exhilirated at their discoveries and take joy in their creativity.  While much of the Blue Man Group's mischief in the regular shows is missing here--the Complex Rock Tour is exactly that, and omits most of the clowning--the Rock Tour seems to be more cohesive than the shows, and to me more emotionally satisfying.

Our Uruguay critic is wildy and totally wrong that the instruments used by BMG are ""completely non-functional"".  They are fully functional, new instruments; BMG give some details in one of their CDs but unfortunately there's nothing here except the video of those instruments in use.  Anyone who has gone to a BMG event knows well that the performers are very fine percussionists and this is NOT just ""lip-synching"" for drums.  The imagination that has gone into the creation of these instruments is awe inspiring.  My son was so taken with Blue Man Group that he built his own tubulum--the PVC marimba-like instrument--and his own drumbone, even though he isn't a percussionist.

The DVD does have some terrific extras, though, including three music videos (one with Dave Matthews and Blue Man Group doing a very creepy version of ""Sing Along"") and a flip side of the DVD with tracks especially mixed for 5 speaker surround sound.  This package is a real treat--I've bought one for my college library, I own one, and I'm getting one each for my son and brother.  You should get one, too!",1094256000,10,2269,4.81701030927835

Plus, this DVD gives you a feel for a Blue Man Group show, although the non-touring show that I went to seemed more impressive than the tour, but that's just my opinion.",1091318400,2,438,4.395061728395062

1922556,5,B0000DBJ9P,"Driving into Las Vegas I saw the billboards for the Blue Man Group show at Mandalay Bay.  As far as I could tell, the whole schtick of the show is that there are three guys and, well, they're blue.  Now that I have watched some of their videos over the internet, I can give a more nuanced review of this show:
If Laurie Anderson were to spend five years sniffing model glue and  then hire some male models to appear in her place, you would have Blue Man Group.  Yes, the whole schtick of it is that they're blue.  No, the ""concepts"" invoked in their shows are not sophisticated, unless you consider it the height of performance art sophistication for there to be a screen behind the band flashing the words, ""If you are paying attention, please yell"" and for the basic entertainment value of the blue men to be that they are blue and that they look around and at one another with quizzical expressions while pretending to play ""instruments"" which are completely non-functional and are in fact just large white pvc fittings assembled in ""organic""-looking ways vaguely reminiscent of the alien space ships and alien from the movie... alien.
I would suggest a better title for this DVD is Compost Rock.

1922560,5,B0000DBJ9P,"The first time I ever saw the BMG, it was in Las Vegas in July of 2000.  That's when I fell in love with them!  I even went to go see the Vegas show for a second time in December of 2001.  When I heard that BMG was coming to my home town of Calgary AB, I was sooo excited.  I went to see the Complex show live and LOVED it.  That's why I was quite excited to buy the DVD.  Let me just say that I was NOT disappointed.  The DVD sure did capture the mood and fun of the actual Live show.  The music is incredible and sounds great if you have a good stereo system with surround sound.  Although I did watch the DVD on my portable DVD player for a second time, with just an ordinary set of earphones and even then, it still sounded great. The footage they chose was excellent and sure did bring back lots of good Blue Man memories. The bonus videos are also quite good.  I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and recommend it to any BMG fan or even those that do not know much about BMG but are curious to see what the hype is....you won't be disappointed!  GO GET THIS DVD...or at least borrow it from someone willing to let it go for a few days!",1082332800,3,1135,3.9559471365638768
1922561,4,B0000DBJ9P,"I saw the ""freeview"" of this show on DirectTV, and ordered the DVD based on my enjoyment of that. I did not look closely at the DVD spec.'s when I ordered it, and was rather disappointed upon playing it that it is only viewable in 4:3 screen size (even though it was obviously shot in 16:9) and that the only sound option is Dolby Surround (no 5.1 or DTS digital sound). There are 3 bonus tracks on the flip side in 5.1 sound, but I just find it hard to imagine why anyone would produce a new DVD these days that does not support HDTV presentation and 5.1 or better digital sound.
Other than that, I still really enjoyed the show and feel it's a worthwhile purchase for anyone who enjoys the BMG's creativity, fun, and sense of parody/satire. It is an entertaining show, and some of the music is quite good on its own (i.e.: I can enjoy it without the theatrical elements). Perhaps, if we're lucky, the 3 ""bonus"" 5.1 audio tracks on the flipside are a precursor to a full-fledged 16:9 video and digital audio ""enhanced"" DVD-to-come?",1081900800,9,1032,4.436842105263158

But in the interest of brevity, all I can say is you'll have never seen anything like this before and you'll never see anything like this again.  Sometimes, luck lets you live in a period of existence where you see something truly new and truly spectacular and in that moment, the sensation is realized.  This is the experience of BMG.",1081468800,,446,4.55

These guys are without a doubt the most original band I have ever seen! You can't compare them to anybody! Buy this DVD! You WILL NOT BE SORRY!!!!!!",1079481600,2,295,3.933333333333333
1922565,5,B0000DBJ9P,"Man, I can't believe some of these reviews! Ask yourself a question, people: ""Were you entertained?"" If you answer ""yes,"" and you must, then it seems this alone should be worth the price of the DVD. Anyway, I don't want to get too negative about what others write, so I'll get on with my review.
I can remember when BMG was on Johnny Carson. I always thought they were amazing, getting wild sounds out of the most unusual, yet common things. I filed this away as fun entertainment, but thought there would be no way could I sit through too much of it.
Fast forward a few years and I find myself married to a great girl who loves to watch concerts on DVDs. She REALLY loves BMG. So I bought this DVD for her, thinking I could take it if it got a bit stale. Man, this DVD blew me away!!! We had the TV turned up to 11!!!
These guys are so talented, funny, intelligent, innovative ... I just can't find the adjectives to describe it all. This DVD is an absolute BLAST to watch! You'll see Tracy Bonham, Venus Hum (two days later, I still can't get this great old tune out of my head!), and Dave Matthews in a bonus video, to name a few celebs.
""Exhibit 13"" is a song and bonus video about 9/11 (although there is no reference to it specifically). Typically for BMG, it is a rather chilling, if odd, look at what all those little bits of paper represented on that awful day. It is simply a different look at a day that has been burned into the mind of the world. It was refreshing, though, if just for that reason.
Trust me, your entertainment dollar is well-spent with this DVD.",1078099200,26,1575,4.253333333333333
1922566,4,B0000DBJ9P,"I read some review here and almost didn't buy this because some were disappointed that the footage is not of one of their main shows.  I saw their Vegas show last summer and absolutely loved it.  They obviously are not going to sell their show video to keep it exclusive (probably to make us go to the Luxor in Vegas and drop a few bills in the casino).  Their Vegas show is about 50% comedy and 50% music.  This DVD (Complex Tour) is about 90% music and 10% comedy.  The Blue Men still have their trademark personality in this video.  Noticed that Venus Hum is lip-synching.  Wonder if anything else is faked?  This DVD isn't very expensive and I highly recommend it if you are a fan.  And yes, spring the money and go see them live.  The show is a sarcasm on our high-tech generic society.",1076803200,4,791,4.319727891156463
1922567,5,B0000DBJ9P,"I love everything about Blue Man Group: the concept; the music; the humor; and, of course, the weirdness. This DVD is NOT of one of the typical BMG shows from New York, Boston, Chicago, or Las Vegas, rather, it is a concert from their recent 'Complex Rock Tour', which is totally different materiel. The DVD was actually taken from two shows, one in Dallas, and one in Minneapolis. I was fortunate enough to be at the Minneapolis show that this DVD is partially taken from, and watching this is almost as good as being there.
The musical performances, showmanship, sound quality, and cinematography on the DVD are breathtaking, and make me want to go see BMG again as soon as possible. There are standout performances by guest vocalists Tracy Bonham and Venus Hum (in the greatest dress I have ever seen anywhere on anyone.) I would have liked to see the Bonham opening set (especially the Led Zeppelin violin recital), but unfortunately the producers didn't accommodate my desires.  Here both vocalists are used to excellent effect.
The music itself is potently addictive (I have the soundtrack CD in my car) and intriguing. Of course BMG is known for percussion (which I adore), and that is spotlighted to excellent effect on the DVD. The whole band is wonderful, and provides an excellent, and often whimsical, backdrop for the antics of the three Blue Men. Particular standouts for me are ""Above"", ""Time to Start"", ""Up On The Roof"", and the beautiful, haunting tribute to September 11 victims, ""Exhibit 13."" Also of note are the comedic links used in which an offstage recorded voice gives instructions in 'Rock Star Movements' which the Blue Men then teach the audience (my personal favorites are Numbers 4 and 237.)
The DVD has a couple of extras, including the music videos for ""Sing Along"" (featuring a dazed looking Dave Matthews), ""The Current"", and the magnificently minimalist ""Exhibit 13."" Be sure to watch these, as they give a totally different perspective on the songs. You also want to catch the DVD credits. I won't say why, but trust me on this one.
All told, this is an excellent introduction to the eccentricity that is Blue Man Group, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in music, comedy, or general oddity.",1075507200,223,2240,4.848563968668407
1922568,5,B0000DBJ9P,"First of all, the facts. Blue Man Group (BMG), the Complex Rock Tour Live, is NOT a DVD of a typical BMG show, such as the one I experienced at the Luxor in Las Vegas. If you want a DVD of that show and would be disappointed in anything else, then do not buy this one. However, if you've seen the fabulous Men in Blue, with their unique, theatrical perspective on what it means to live in the 21st century, and would like to see what a rock concert staged by them would look like, then get it by all means! Basically, Complex Rock Tour is a parody of every rock concert you've ever attended, right down to the audience participation. As always, the Blue Men never speak; they merely hold up signs, play prerecorded announcements, or use grand gestures to indicate what the audience is to do next, sing along, yell, raise fists, whatever. The percussion and guitar heavy backup band is a killer, and guest vocalists Tracy Bonham and Venus Hum are wonderful. The Blue Men do some of their famous bits, such as pipe percussion (you have to see it to belive it; it's great!), but mostly act as postmodern emcees and react to the strange phenomenon of a rock concert taking place all around them. If you've never experienced BMG before, I know that after reading the above, you are probably still confused as to what takes place during this or any other BMG show. I'm sorry, I've done my best, but the truth is that a BMG show simply defies description. There is only one thing in common: Everyone who goes to see a BMG show LOVES IT!! Children love the blue painted faces and all the cool visuals. Thinkers love the philosophical approach, a kind of Jung on acid experience. Non-English speakers also seem to relish their shows; a BMG experience is so captivating, so utterly overwhelming that even if you don't understand it all, you can sit back and enjoy a masterfully produced show. So, get Complex Rock Tour Live ASAP, watch it over and over, then attend the closest BMG show. Trust me, it's an experience you won't soon forget!!!",1075075200,13,2031,4.521739130434782
1922569,4,B0000DBJ9P,"I've been to the Blue Man Group's theatrical productions in Chicago and Vegas, and enjoyed both very much, and managed to see the last show of the tour, but the first experience is always the one that stands out.  I knew the Rock Concert Tour was something the BMG was trying to attempt for some time, and the Complex Tour was a great effort.
Some of the vocalists on the CD did not tour with BMG, but contrary to another review, a few of the vocalists did.  Tracy Bonham sang ""Up to the Roof"" on the CD, and helped out with other songs on the tour.  Venus Hum was there for ""I Feel Love"", an awesome Donna Sommer cover (and no, I'm not a Donna Sommer fan).
What you get on this DVD is a compilation of 2 shows.  As a result, some of what you see isn't always in synch with what you hear.  But it's close.  To the average viewer, it won't even be noticed.  You also get a few music videos that have been played on VH-1.  On the flip side of the DVD are 3 songs in 5.1 and DTS.  A full 5.1/DTS Audio-DVD will be released later this year.
As far as a Blue Man Group experience... that really can only be had experiencing them live.
What you don't get on this DVD are the cool opening sets by Tracy Bonham and Venus Hum.  Every headliner needs an opening act, right?  They alternated as opening acts for BMG during the tour.
You don't get the ""White Rabbit"" Jefferson Airplane cover, and you don't get the purported spontaneous playing of ""Freebird"" when someone in the audience yells out the request.
As far as concert DVD's go, this is one of the best.  For someone who's never seen them, and lives too far to see one of their theatrical productions, this DVD will help bridge the gap.",1073347200,61,1684,4.228125
1922570,4,B0000DBJ9P,"Well, since there were no reviews about the DVD before I ordered it, I was sorta disappointed.  I have been wanting to get ahold of a BMG video forever, and when this came out, I felt slighted that they had almost no footage of the cool stuff these guys do onstage.  If you're planning to buy this DVD, hoping to see all kinds of stuff flying around, shot into the audience, psychidelic stuff, things hanging from the ceiling, and other crazy stuff like they do, be forewarned.  This is basically a rock concert.  They have some of their tubes and stuff, but really, it's a rock concert.
Having said that, it was really great.  The performance definitely makes it a worthwhile purchase, and as others have said, the band is top-notch.  The DVD mix is okay, but it could have been better.  It's obvious at some points that some of the stuff isn't live, like the blue guys playing the drumbone- the playing and sliding doesn't completely match the music, kinda like lip-synching.  Also, I'm a big 5.1 surround fan, so I was hoping more would be recorded in 5.1, but only 3 songs on the flipside of the DVD were 5.1, and those were videos, not concert footage.

They perform their songs,they do what they do, and,it's ""kind of/sort of"" like you are actually at one of their performances.
