3646076,5,B001HZXYDC,"It's all over. Bummer.

BSG in it's latest iteration carried those poor survivors a heck of a lot farther than the original series (there are still die-hard fans of the original series out there, who absolutely HATE this series, but theirs is a minority, I believe).

For a series that had only three well-known actors surrounded by fresh new Canadian, Australian, English and American actors, The talent pool they were taken from is rich indeed, and it showed in their performances. I believe we will be seeing much more of these young people in the future. Of course, they wouldn't be as good without quality writing and directing, either. This series had it all! For once, the network heads decided to let BSG run WITHOUT too much network interference, which ALWAYS destroys the show in question.

I have to give kudos to Edward J. Olmos, Mary McDonnell, Dean Stockwell and all those relative unknowns they acted beside, and the Writers and Directors, as well as the crew for bringing such a quality program to Network TV. Now, I may be just a little bit biased, but I have to say that BSG was (is?) the best show I have seen in the 55+ years I've been exposed to TV. The fact that we have a drama in space turns off some folk, but believe me when I say that I would rather watch a GREAT space drama than a crappy show on Earth that is predictable and boring, with performances on par with a 7th grade reading class!

With all the extras and websites devoted to this series out there, including SciFi Channel, the storyline is now complete, but boy, was it ever difficult to predict what was going to happen next! In four years of predictions, I was right only ONCE, and that came at the end! Ron Moore and David Eick are the next wave in QUALITY storytelling. There seems to be TWO new series coming soon on SciFi Channel that are tie-ins to BSG. One is called ""Caprica"", and the other is ""Battlestar Galactica, The Plan"". I believe that these two new series will tie up most, if not all (hopefully)of the plot holes and apparent dead ends seen in the new BSG series. If Ron Moore and David Eick have a hand in them, I'll be watching!

My hope is that ""Hollyweird"" finally gives breathing room for those forward thinking folk like Moore and Eick, and other Writers and Directors who are well past the ""status quo"" of Hollywood storytelling, which has grown old, fat, and not without the ubiquitous olfactory signal to let you know how bad what you're watching REALLY is!

BSG broke the mold, so all you Hollyweird knuckleheads are on notice!",1237680000,65,2545,4.533769063180828
3646077,5,B001HZXYDC,Thank you Ronald Moore and David Eick (and everyone else associated with them) for the past six years with some of the best story telling that has ever been produced.,1237680000,5,166,4.566666666666666
3646078,5,B001HZXYDC,"I won't leave a spoiler in here but... when Kara blew up at the end of season 3 I cried and tonight was way worse it all came together and freaked me out... they better get this out on DVD ASAP and wait till fall when we get the Cylons side of the story!

3646079,4,B001HZXYDC,"I agree that partial season are BS.  However, if you wait for the full season 4 to be released it will be very cold in Hades before you are able to buy a unified Season 4.  Its called marketing and it is a great way for them to make us spend more money.  Do I like it? Absolutely not.  do I expect  them to change? Absolutely not.

BTW, this is the final season of BSG so enjoy it while you can!",1236124800,4,395,3.814814814814815
3646080,3,B001HZXYDC,"Sure, we've all been victimised by the writer's strike (and they had every right to it, IMO), but why postpone the inevitable complete series box?

The rating would of course be higher if it had been the full series. Asides from that, up to this point (4.14) the quality has gone down IMO. Personally I dislike the infighting and would vastly prefer to continue with the storyline proper. But hope springs eternal :)

From a commercial perspective it's a nice thought to get rid of the 4.0 boxes by creating a 4.5 but let's get real: anyone with a semblance of common sense will wait for the entire series.",1234051200,11,606,4.5504587155963305
3646081,5,B001HZXYDC,"why must they break it in half then only sell it one half at a time?
do they do this to torment us???

they torment me...and i think its on purpose.

3646082,5,B001HZXYDC,I have been a loyal Battlestar Galactica fan since the season started way back when.  I am convinced that the series has great potential and am looking forward to the future seasons.  I prefer seeing further aditions to the series,1231718400,4,230,4.725

3646091,4,B001HZXYDC,"I was a bit hesitant to order this last set of the series after reading some reviews saying there was a problem with the last disk. I did not experience any issues with playback. It may be certain DVD/Blu-ray players that have an issue. I've run across that before myself. Last time I had an issue I ran a firmware update to my Blu-ray player and everything works fine since.

I'm not going to review the BSG series itself other than to say that I love it. But I will say that I have not been entirely happy with the DVD sets. This one in particular annoyed me with only having two episodes on each disk. Instead of moving on to the next episode they instead include unaired/uncut/extended versions of the episode you just watched. Why is it annoying? Because I just watched that and now you tell me there is a 'bettter' version of it on the next menu screen? Why would I watch again? A better idea would be to put the regular and the unaired/uncut/extended on the same screen and let me choose which one I want to see. Kind of felt like they were padding the DVDs so you don't feel cheated buying half a season.

I won't say that I would not recommend this or any of the other DVD sets for the series. I've enjoyed watching them all. It is a great show and I found the characters engaging and the stories well written. Unlike most SyFy shows I actually wanted to watch it. My only issue is with the DVD menus and the fact that both seasons 2 and 4 were released in two parts. I'm kind of interested in watching Caprica which suffers from the same issue as well.",1491782400,,1562,4.255892255892256

3646105,4,B001HZXYDC,I love this show and own all the disks (DVD). My experience with season 4.5 is that the finale on the last disk seems to have a manufacturing issue that causes small freezes and skips. I returned the set to Amazon and they replaced it with another new set with the same problem. I then bought a used set in excellent condition from a book store and it was even worse. I tested the disks in more than one DVD player. I have not had this problem with any other ep in any of the other season disks. I was disappointed to have to watch the finale (both regular and extended) with these freezes and skips. I can only find one reference to this problem on the web....a guy who reviewed this set for Walmart said that the last disk had problems. I can only surmise that a recent manufacturing run has resulted in this issue because it doesn't seem like anyone else has had problems.,1470009600,2,875,4.27710843373494

3646122,3,B001HZXYDC,"I had problems with the final disk playing, it would just stop and I'd have to fast forward to get it going again.  Also, on some of the episode, some strange letterings would appear on the screen and I'd have to eject disc and then reinsert it to make them go away.  Also, on one episode, it is like some bad editing or something, on one statement a character says something, I just can't understand what they are saying.  Had to initiate the closed captioning to see what they said.

So I returned the box set and get a new one.  Same problems existed on the new set, so it must be this issue.

By the way, did the writers start taking crack somewhere mid-way through season 4?",1445644800,,679,4.265625

3646167,5,B001HZXYDC,"When Science Fiction became stale and the television landscape filled with the reality nonsense this show appeared to push the envelope of science fiction and drama. Turning a cheesy 70's sci-fi show into one of the greatest remakes ever to be produced.

The creators of this masterpiece were able to take something that was so memorable in the 70's and flip it until it only resembled the past, but turn it into something even more memorable and relevant today. By taking modern issues and creating allegories for us to study and learn by, this show pushed our imagination and allowed us for a brief moment to submit to the possibility of greatness.

Each hour of this show is a non-stop critique of our own weaknesses, with a lesson to be hopeful. In the years since this show went off the air, I have hoped for something great to come back to Syfy, sadly though in that time nothing approaches what this show achieved, instead we are left with the cheesy movie of the week and WWE wrestling.

If you have never seen this show, I highly recommend picking up all four seasons of this and watching them multiple times over, as its as much intellectually stimulating as it is action-based.",1419292800,,1188,4.647619047619048

3646195,5,B001HZXYDC,"I understand now why this series was considered a classic in the genre of Science Fiction; however, at the same time, it was very real in its portrayal of the emotions we experience every day. Somehow, the producers and actors were able to get the bigger points across about humanity and its struggles and disappointments, its hopes and dreams.  I was anxious as to how this series would end without leaving unanswered questions; I was afraid it would be another LOST.  Although bittersweet, the ending was done with compassion and clarity. I found the entire series to be much more than just another Sci-Fi story one watches solely for  entertainment.  I think I would not have been as impressed had I watched the series on TV with a little of the story each week. There was a deeper story involved, and I think unless you watch the entire 4 years one after the other, you miss that.",1394668800,,884,4.611464968152866

3646200,5,B001HZXYDC,Am finally watching Season 4 now. As a hardcore Battlestar Galactica fan I slowly acquired all four seasons. I tend to watch these during the winter months spending more time indoors. I have enjoyed the series and look forward to the conclusion in Season 4. Fortunately I have no spoilers yet as friends who have seen the series have been quiet about how it ends.,1387929600,,363,4.6
3646201,5,B001HZXYDC,I really loved the show when it aired on scy fy Chanel . I think it was a great conclusion to the series. The bluray has a lot of extras and makes the space battles that much better.,1386979200,,182,3.8157894736842106
3646202,5,B001HZXYDC,"This is one of those, ""I can't believe this deal!"" purchases.  I bought this for under $7, with free shipping because of Amazon Prime.  I have seasons 1 through 4.0 on DVD and was looking to complete my set.  This is one of the most incredible deals I've ever gotten.

As far as the series itself go, I had previously watched this season on DVD (I rented), and the contrast between the two are amazing.  The clarity of the Blu-ray almost defeated the producers aim of filming in HD but trying to make it look aged.

This, in my opinion, is one of the greatest series ever developed for TV.  I remembered watching and enjoying the original when I was a kid, but this series aren't exactly for kids.  I don't believe in spoilers, however, the ending of this series is truly thought provoking and can be a continuation series on its own.

I am glad this series was remade, and the way in which it was.  Now if someone can only remake ""Buck Rogers"" and ""The Greatest American Hero"" in the same way.",1386547200,,994,4.353260869565218

3646207,3,B001HZXYDC,This product I am upset with.  I purchased 4.5 Battlestar and this 4.0 Battlestar.  It is a waste of money because in the 4.0 is 4.5 and you do not have too buy 4.5.

3646209,5,B001HZXYDC,"The final season of ""Battlestar Galactica"" concludes in fiery fashion worthy of the great epics.  Season 4.0 showed the Colonials, and their Cylon allies, standing upon the surface of the irradiated wasteland of planet Earth.  It seems that, 2000 years earlier, there had been another nuclear holocaust involving the Cylons.  Sam Anders, Chief Tyrol, Tory Foster and Colonel Tigh were all there, and the visions of that tragedy comes flashing back as they try to come to terms with what the bitter disappointment of Earth means.  It now gives clear definition to the oft-repeated phrase, ""this has all happened before.  It will all happen again.""

  Four years of running for their lives and hoping to find salvation, only to find nothing of the sort, proves to be the breaking point for much of the fleet.  Some cannot deal with the overwhelming sadness and take their own lives.  Others feel betrayed by Admiral Adama and President Roslin and lead an uprising that results in countless more senseless deaths.

  In the midst of all this horror and depression, there still remains a sliver of hope that a livable planet can be found and the war can be ended.  The final showdown with the Cylons is a truly epic space battle, made even greater as you come to realize the stakes.

  The series finale, derided by some and praised by others, is able to make you feel both melancholy and satisfied at the same time.  The battle is fought and characters' histories and final destinies find clarity.  Some felt the final episode was a cop out.  I disagree, because I feel that it remained honest and truthful the characters and the larger ideological quest.

  Even after having gone through the entire series a third time, the story remains to the forefront in my mind long after I have finished watching.  To me, that is the defining characteristic of a great series.",1374796800,,1864,4.789308176100629
3646210,5,B001HZXYDC,"I'm working out of town and this DVD set is a life saver when I go home to an empty Hotel room.  Fills my evenings.

3646211,5,B001HZXYDC,"This is how to do a blu-ray set for a sci-fi TV show! The Battlestar Galactica blu-ray comes loaded with extras. There commentaries for each episode, sometimes more than one. These aren't just fluff or useless trivia about special effects. Rather, the writers take care to explain their inspiration for the episodes, some of the challenges they faced, editing decisions, and even some of their disappointments. I'd recommend these commentaries for anybody interested in writing dramatic fiction. Almost every episode has deleted scenes.

The whole series out on blu-ray now, so obviously don't buy this unless you only want the second half of season 4. That said, season 4 had its ups and downs. I thought the first half was a bit lost and aimless, but the second half has some of the most dramatic episodes of the series as the characters struggle with the repercussions of finding ""Earth"" and the alliance with the Cylons. There are some truly shocking moments. One of the best things about this show is how far it's willing to go in torturing its characters.

Definitely recommended. 4.5 stars.",1371859200,,1097,4.956521739130435
3646212,5,B001HZXYDC,"When I heard that Battle Star Gallactica was being re-done I had mixed feelings about it because I enjoyed the original series and was afraid of the changes I was reading about. Watching the mini series I liked the production values, the excellent acting, etc.,.....but something seemed to be missing. There was a starkness and dark quality that bothered me. But overall, it was well made. I wondered if I would warm up to the new show as time progressed.
As the characters developed and the story progressed I liked how everything evolved, something the original series did not get a chance to do. Over time I warmed up to the new cast and enjoyed the stories. Like many science fiction shows they take time to develope and BSG was no different. The final 2 years I thought were outstanding and I apprecicated the way in which some acknowledgement to the original show was made in the form of props, older model Cylons, and music. The final 2 shows were terrific and I loved Adama's final walk through the battle worn Gallactica and leaving in his old fighter with original theme music playing. Finding a new home on a young planet and Rossline's character dying while Adama flys her around showing her their new home was touching, I felt his grief and loss knowing he could not build a life with her. Yes, this is soap opera in space, but its very well done and will be remembered as one of the very best shows and series.",1370822400,,1424,4.544747081712062

3646218,5,B001HZXYDC,"The entire ""reimagined"" Battlestar Galactica series is one, if not the best, soap opera ever made for TV. The topics woven into the fabric of this series are extremely timely in our modern world. But you really have to start with season 1 episode 1 and watch them in sequence all the way through all 76 episodes. The plots are too dependent on the viewer knowing what's happened before to simply watch single episodes like in a conventional TV series.",1362268800,,451,4.65

3646226,3,B001HZXYDC,"Ron Moore, one of the brains behind Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, took his darker view of sci-fi to the new Battlestar Galactica series with generally positive results. This isn't Star Trek by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it's tough to compare BSG to any other sci-fi show. It combines an in-depth story arc, top-notch acting, realistic special effects, and a pseudo-documentary cinematic style to create a unique experience.

Unlike Star Trek, BSG tries to depict a gritty, realistic vision of humanity's future. In the first few episodes, a race of evil robots called the Cylons attack 12 human colonies, leaving only a few tens of thousands of humans left in the galaxy. The humans band together in a convey of ships to search for Earth.

I loved the first season of BSG, liked many episodes from season 2, liked a few episodes from season 3, and... started to despise season 4. Season 4 focuses almost exclusively on the pseudo-religious plot with Gaius Baltar as a sort of Christlike figure. I have nothing against religion, but the use of religious metaphors in BSG was always a bit too on the nose. Oddly, the show doesn't use religion to talk about morality, in the way that Star Trek was often a series of morality plays, but rather as plot devices.

I've never liked the Cylons much as villains, but season 4 takes them to an all new low. First, there's a civil war within the Cylons. A civil war, among machines? Really? Then, it turns out that human-Cylon hybrids run all of the ships. The show uses them as babbling oracles. Again, this seemed to come out of left field.

Overall, I love individual episodes of BSG, but I don't like the larger story or the Cylons. Individual episodes can have great character moments or engage in deep moral questions. However, when character and morals take a backseat, the series flounders. Still, it's definitely must-see television for sci-fi fans. I wish season 4 had focused less on plot and more on smaller character moments. As it is, I found myself losing interest and almost stopped watching the series entirely.",1356998400,,2079,4.766666666666667
3646227,5,B001HZXYDC,The last set I needed to complete the series.  This show was a great ride!  Very good and thought provoking ending.,1356480000,,115,4.428571428571429

3646230,5,B001HZXYDC,"This is the end of the great journey for the Galactica. The colonists finally put an end to the Cylon threat, and find their new home. As epic a series as Galactica is, it's hard to imagine a conclusion that could do it justice. This series has an amazing and very satisfying ending. It definitely does not disappoint. You have to check it out.",1351382400,,344,4.390625
3646231,1,B001HZXYDC,"I love the series so far but why was a season 4.5 released if season 4 contains what would be classified as Season 4, 4.5 PLUS Razor?

3646232,5,B001HZXYDC,Loved it. They could have ended it a few different ways but I thought this was an acceptable option. They have conflict with religion in the whole show and this ending seemed to me like it sided on the religion part. Thats ok with me and they do a great job closing it up but what could have made it better is if it had a huge twist thrown in at the end to completely throw the audience off. That is what I like. I wasn't expecting this ending so it still got me but there was probably another way they could have done it with an even bigger effect. This petty much plays it safe while still being good. Be careful when reading the reviews because there are spoilers in them without warning. The overall series is one of the best i have ever seen.,1348876800,,747,4.123287671232877

3646234,3,B001HZXYDC,"the remade BSG started out so strong in the beginning, but as the years went on it became clear the writers never had a clear understanding of their own story and instead were ""winging it"" the whole time..... this isolated viewers who stopped watching and left the ending only 75% complete and feeling overall tepid.

season 4.5 is ok, they wrapped together the disparate storylines as best they could.  BSG's ending is a solid 3 of 5 stars, you'll remember it in a positive light and respect it but it's nothing to love.

the unfortunate blowback to the BSG universe is that the flat ending is most likely what killed the proposed prequel series (Blood & Chrome) and the potential movie before they ever got started.",1342656000,,717,4.674603174603175
3646235,1,B001HZXYDC,"I think most of us got hooked on BSG with Season 1, and continued our elation through Season 2.  Beginning with Season 3, it got sort of 50/50 BSG vs. ""Soap Opera"".  Well, in my opinion, the transition to Soap Opera became complete in Season 4.0, and especially 4.5.  David Eick was now gone, off to his next project, ""Bionic Woman"".  There came to be as many Executive Producers, Producers, Assistant Producers and Operating Producers as there were cast members.  They even let Edward James Olmos direct an episode.  The video blogs revealed that there had been many, many major rewrites.  It appears to me that, other than having sketched out a few major ending themes (and that's a ""maybe""), the only purpose to Season 4.0 and 4.5 was to give us ""and ending.""  And I don't think they knew what that ending was going to be.  That much seemed clear in Collection 4.0. But in Collection 4.5, it was complete.  The fact is, it was now, to me, episode after episode of ""filler""...just to complete the series.  Unless you're someone who feels a need to complete your ""collection"", I advise you to stop at Season 3, and just know that they find Earth, it isn't what they thought it would be, and the rest is just mashed potatoes.  Enjoy Seasons 1-3, be glad we finally got a *serious* BSG for those 3 years, and let it go at that.  Season 4 is an orphan.",1337817600,,1350,4.461224489795918

3646238,5,B001HZXYDC,"I can hardly find words to state my admiration for the new Battlestar Galactica as a whole - and it is even harder for me to correctly describe the ending, which I loved and hated in the same time. But even if I absolutely HATED one (and only one) thing in the last episode, as a whole I rate this final season five stars without a moment of hesitation.

If you watched the previous seasons, you will probably understand how addictive and irresistible those series were. I swallowed all the seasons as if I was an alcoholic and if they were old scotch - gulping, slurping, crying and moaning, forgetting anything and everything else. If you did not watch the previous seasons, do it immediately! As a whole the new Battlestar Galactica is an incredible show, operating at a level much above the usual TV series - in my modest opinion, only two other shows, ""The Shield"" and ""The Wire"", reached the same level of perfection.

There are many sad and heartbreaking moments in those series - I do not want to provide too much spoilers, but twice I almost cried. Death and suffering are everywhere and the story becomes even darker and more desperate that in the beginning miniseries. It would seem that it is very hard to do something darker and more desperate than a nuclear war and extermination of humanity - well, as you will see, it can be done. Some much beloved characters will not make it until the final credits.

In those final episodes three are even more outstanding, reaching a quality that I simply can not describe with words. Two of them, ""Oath"" and ""Blood on the scales"", describe a short but extremely vicious and bloody civil war erupting in the human fleet. They are absolutely exceptional and I will not say anything more about them - you deserve to discover them yourself.

And then arrives the very last episode, ""Daybreak, part 2"", which is twice as long than usual. I believe that the first 40 minutes of it are possibly the best TV science fiction I have ever seen and in fact I consider them as good as ""Star Wars"" (and this is a HUGE compliment coming from me). The only thing I will say here is that most of those 40 minutes are a battle... and WHAT a battle it is!

Then comes the part I hated with my whole heart because it was SO INCREDIBLY STUPID and politically correct that I could hardly believe my eyes! If you really need to know what I am talking about, there is enough spoilers in other reviews here (especially the ones giving one star). I will just say that the final decision of humans and Cylons of the fleet defies reason and logic and guarantees to them and their descendants an endless supply of back breaking labor, inescapable misery, heartbreaking suffering and return to the most obscure savagery - provided that they survive at all (and in my modest opinion they would not).

Many reviewers strongly objected to the Christian messages in those last episodes of Battlestar Galactica and it is clear that they are very strongly present. Being a Christian I rather appreciated it - but for atheists this final season can be indeed very upsetting.

All in all, I loved the whole series and I loved the final season as much as the rest - even if there was ONE politically correct, New Age inspired and galactically stupid black spot, which made me howl with anger and disgust in the last 30 minutes of the last episode. But then, the VERY final punch line in the last seconds of the last episode made me immediately forget that bad moment...

I recommend those series and this final season with my whole heart - I spend wonderful moments watching the new Battlestar Galactica and I think you will too.",1336435200,,3644,4.552671755725191

3646241,5,B001HZXYDC,"Have now watched series in its entirety twice( once in television viewing and again in dvd format).Absolutely the most in depth and  refreshing science fiction ever created. Series does take a shift when new caprica is found and some viewers I see bashed series for this change. Granted some episodes in season 4.5 ( not so much 4) were a bit questionable but as a whole package it does deliver. To those that think that some things were not explained you weren't paying attention. Amazing how the whole story was put together and explained. From the destruction of earth and the final five being created. The end of the war 40 yrs prior to the destruction of caprica. One things I am slightly perplexed by is that John( cylon) states he can never forgive the humans for enslaving the centerions) yet they are doing the exact same thing. Granted when centerions  become aware and see that higher brain function is being reversed they rebel but still john stating his hatred of humanity (one of them anyway) due to this is a bit odd. Also starbuck vanishing takes some belief in religious  belief rather than science fiction explaination. Otherwise all is explained well. The resurrection hub being destroyed and the cyclon/human kid being essential to the cylons survival was very well done

I am not sure how a different plot selection could have been better. If the final five ,mutiny and earth plot lines weren't taken what alse could have been done? Maybe more space action ar another civilization could have been found ?Would have ruined the show imo. It would have started to look like star trek instead of the amazing storyline being told. The only plot twist at the very end that would have been interesting would have been to see an advanced society. But after seeing such a thing how could the show possibly have gone on from that point? What the crew blends into modern day society? Or backtrack to the cylons before colony is detroyed and both the cylons and humans find a race even more advanced and evil than the cylons( or some of them anyway) .Actually the time to do such a thing would have been when the pegaus arrived ( prior to the direcion the show took with the final five,earths destruction etc).

Well done show,sad it is over. Do not look forward to Blood and Crome as much( if it ever arrives).Will be too much backstory. A new series with new ideas would be best. Perhaps a competant retelling of the original battlestar series that is as well done as this version was? This show is over though it has been told and it is time to let it rest. I would give it 4 stars !",1325894400,,2595,4.572043010752688

3646244,5,B001HZXYDC,"One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'
and 'Breaking Bad'.

Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,
not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like a
great novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.

Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich' world of the cop
show to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'Battlestar
Galactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robot
wars the same way.

This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,
or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to be
a human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,
fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recent
politics and real world situations.

My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we tore
through 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.

The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members are
remarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity and
contradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters to
change and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seemingly
inexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -
but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they've
taken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,
even if they're not really why you watch this show.

It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've ever
seen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out and
blown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad to
finish a great book.

I haven't bought it in other forms, so I can't compare, but generally
the blu-ray set (the non-Cylon box) is quite complete, and well packaged.
However, I have read accounts that quality control was a bit of a problem
and I didn't escape the bugs. On a couple of my discs there was
a slight 'pulse' to the image at times. At first I thought perhaps
it was a strange, but intentional, lighting effect, but looking at it carefully
it seemed more a reproduction problem.

This isn't just the intentionally added grain, a look I don't love, but accept
as an artistic decision.

Since then, I've read similar comments from others, so I'm not crazy
(or at least not in this case!). So, if you do order this, you might want
to make sure it's returnable, and try to do a quick quality check the best
you can. Of course, if the problem is intermittent, and mostly in the later
discs, as was in my case, by the time I saw it it was way too late
to ask for an exchange.

None-the-less, for me, the quality of the content way over-rode the
occasional image problems (and I'm a perfectionist - my wife
never noticed the pulsing until I pointed it out.).

As for season 4.5, the ending, the one let down for me in the series
was the very last episode. Certainly no disaster, but for perhaps the only time,
some of the answers felt disappointingly flat and simplistic.

But that wasn't enough to take away from the tremendous esteem with
which I hold the show. One that is surely worth your time, from begining
to end.

As far as getting the individual seasons on blu-ray, it looks as though
you can do better buying the box set, although prices fluctuate
quickly here on Amazon and elsewhere, so I'd advise you do the math
and figure out the most reasonable way to own the complete set.

Also, Amazon UK currently has a region-free complete blu-ray box set for
about $100 with shipping.  It seems to have all the same extras as the US box set.
Well worth considering as long as the price holds up.",1320796800,3,3723,4.519345238095238

I don't agree personally that BSG ended in season III as others have said, but then I happened to like the psycho-dramatic facet of 4.5. A lot. That's just me..a sentimental romantic who loves sci-fi. HOWEVER.  Season 4.5 began with a roar for me and ended with a extremely weak and disappointingly pitiful whimper. For the gods' sake, what  the FRAK  were the writers  thinking? To leave the mystery of Kara (my personal fave character)Thrace's death ,her equally mysterious resurrection (or WAS it? if not,just WHAT or who was that in Kara's form?) and mysterious significance in determining the fate of all  that's left of mankind  unanswered or even HINTED at belies understanding. Furthermore, (SPOILER ALERT),  for the BSG crew to come to a practically neanderthal world and then destroy all their weapons, tools,and technology so that they , too, can live like cave-men, because, you know, it's just so much more RIGHTEOUS and responsible and won't ever, ever lead to a world of corrupt mentality in which humans misuse their knowledge and power. As it inevitably will  anyway?  (Or is Hera,  in some way that , thanks to the writers and Mr. Olmos, remains unexplained to date,  the reason it won't happen again?)

My final words on  BSG 4.5:  The writers added a heaping dose of insult to our intelligence with the lethal injury of a cop-out non-resolution in the series finale of this otherwise excellent series .",1314662400,,1612,4.810909090909091
3646248,3,B001HZXYDC,"Battlestar Galactica was one of my favorite TV series ever.  Was...

  The concept was excellent: To have a flawed and very human crew of a space ship almost being killed by cylons (and each other).  While we all remember characters like Adama, Roselin, and Starbuck, it was the flawed people such as Tom Zarek, Col. Tigh, and Gaius Baltar that gave the series its spark.  Unfortunately, after several seasons, the standard episodes consisting of either fighting cylons or political infighting were getting stale.  This led to several concepts that provided short term benefit, but in the long term proved to be a problem.

 WARNING: SPOILERS!

  Chief among these ideas was the concept of the final five.  This concept made very little sense.  There was no attempt to explain who they were, where they came from, what their motivations were, why they didn't remember being cylons, and why they were in the fleet.  These questions are partially explained, but many of the answers feel rushed and hollow.  Also, there are still countless glaring plot holes.  We see several memories and flashbacks showing Adama with Colonel Tigh during the first war.  Apparently they served together.  However, we find out in 4.5 that Tigh didn't even arrive to that region of space at the tail end of the war, and spent all of his time with the cylons until just before they nuked the colonies.  I find it unlikely that the cylons brainwashed groups of people to become friends and family members and created false records of their existence.  If they could do all of that, then they could have just put a nuke into Galactica and blown it up in the miniseries.  Also it is established that the final five were in contact with the cylons and created the ""skin jobs"".  Why then did the cylons not recognize the final five when they came into contact with them?  It is unlikely that they were all pretending not to recognize them.  This is the quintessential mystery that is left to be solved in 4.5.  While BSG did at least attempt to resolve these questions, the solutions feel rushed and incomplete.

  Fortunately, however, the mysteries had to wait until the last several episodes.  In the first few episodes we get a lot of crying, but we also see the suicide of a major character.  This is emotional and they play off of it very well.  After this, however, comes all three stars that I am giving this review.  A likable member of the crew teams up with Tom Zarek to stage a coup against Roselin and Adama.  This is brilliantly done, especially because you can almost sympathize with the crew member's feelings (Zarek is deliciously evil and manipulative).  This ark is very well done and could be the best episode of the series in my opinion.

  Afterwards, however, comes several episodes of backtracking to explain many of the various mysteries that the series has left.  Finally, the evil cylons kidnap Hera, the half cylon baby.  Apparently Hera is the key to everyone's survival.  What doesn't make sense here is that Hera is not unique: Tigh and Caprica Six had a kid too and while Six miscarried, this still proves that other cylon babies are possible.  A superior strategy for the cylons would have been to un-box the one chick cylon still under their control and get busy.  It is also never shown how Hera is important to the humans apart from a vague reference to her being n ancestor of our present species.  Rally, Hera is just used as a plot device to get Adama to take the Galactica on a suicide mission to rescue her.  All of the important characters come along, including some for whom it goes against character and some who were completely useless in the battle.  We do get to see a nice battle with some nice action.  This is also one of the few times that Galactica's guns actually get to shoot at things.  There is some fun action and a weak attempt to explain the ""Opera House"" visions that were in fact pointless as they simply described some action in a battle that amounted to picking up a child in no immediate danger and carrying them to the room next door.

  Finally you end up with all of the cylons dead and the entire cast alive.  The Galactica then jumps to our earth (~10,000 years ago) where they decide that they will abandon all of their technology and live with the cave men.  All the plot lines are wrapped up, some people die, there is lots of crying, and the Galactica with all of their advanced medical supplies is remote piloted into the sun.  9,000 years later the Black Death killed half of the world's population.

  While BSG deserves kudos for at least attempting to wrap up all of their mysteries, the result feels incoherent and incomplete.  The only saving grace this season has are the episodes about the coup.",1312502400,,4750,4.640625

As a middle-aged adult, I had every expectation of this show being strictly a geek-fodder, lowbrow CGI fest. But this show is something else entirely.  But the storyline is actually ridiculously compelling, especially as you move through the series and get into season 3 and start to explore the Cylon perspective. The analogs to contemporary America are thought-provoking and frequently alarming. The characters sometimes drift into cut-out caricatures, but then some new revelation drops and the entire frame of reference for these characters shifts radically into something orders of magnitude removed from workaday sci-fi action figures. The art direction is spectacular: the shots of the various ships moving in space are really quite beautiful, the way the ships move seems entirely realistic and true to motion in zero-gravity environments.

3646255,4,B001HZXYDC,"I was bracing for disappointment after a slew of less than stellar reviews of BSG's closing season. However I seem to be in the minority of those not let down by its finale. Like most made for TV science fiction series, the suspension of disbelief needs to be deep but I feel they acted in good faith in producing a resolution. Some of the numerous themes remained unresolved but others had quite intriguing answers. I feel that, running on adrenalin and emboldened by success, BSG had somewhat painted itself into a corner. Earlier on, the mystery of the final five, while unexpected felt like they simply drew names out of a hat and it didn't seem to fit into the framework previously erected for the reveal and thankfully the whole mystical setting was abandoned. It was as if a better concept had been pasted in place. The conclusion to that mystery was satisfying if one puts the earlier dead end out of ones mind. There are a number of other threads that one should not pull too hard on least they unravel, but the series was quite an achievement. The CGI was far above average, in fact, for my money-outstripped films like the dreadful Avatar released after it. The acting was unexpectedly good with some standout performances and first class casting.
The series does take on a surreal hue towards the end when `the song' starts to infiltrate into the soundtrack and BSG almost goes down the path of that iconic British series finale `The Prisoner'. Like the Prisoner, where one begins to question everything so much that a kind of feedback loop sends you spinning into infinity, that element for me is quite welcome and leaves an ambient glow to series.
Considering the ultimate plot twist at the end, one of a few one can anticipate, how that song is known to them is another thread not explained, but I file that in the same cabinet as why are they speaking English: with regional and national dialects at that. It's a convention that we have agreed to turn a blind eye to for the sake of convenience.
If you got this far through the series I expect there is no turning back and if you favor the surreal over quasi-religious you might very well excuse the unresolved threads and embrace a sincere attempt at closure to an engaging and often surprising journey.",1296432000,,2270,4.635235732009925

3646258,2,B001HZXYDC,"BSG is a dark series, and that's part of what makes it great. But when the darkness becomes predictable, that's a different story.

In its final act, BSG falls prey to predictability and things that just plain don't make sense.

This has become a series where if two  former lovers are reunited and share a tender moment, you know that  one of them is about to  die an abrupt and horrible death.

Early on in this season, that's exactly what happens and it's no surprise when it does.

And there's the final episode itself, that contains a few cryptic, and unnecessary moves.  For example, Admiral Adama rides away in an air craft with a dying president Laura Roslyn, as his son watches them depart for some unknown destination on their new found home planet.

""He's not coming back this time,"" bemoans the Adama sibling.

""Neither am I,"" says the mysterious Kara Thrace, who simply vanishes.

Why was this necessary? Why does Adama not return to live with his people? Why does Kara Thrace simply vanish?

Presumably, it's because the show's creators insist on keeping a bleak tone to the very end, which means Starbuck and Lee Adama can't live happily ever after.

But again, the worst thing about Lee and Starbuck not getting together in the end is not that it's unhappy. No, the problem is that it's predictable.

The truth is, this entire season just feels tacked on, created simply because season 4.0 left loose ends that had to be cleared up. In truth, the series had the chance to end  on a much better note in season 4.0.

3646261,1,B001HZXYDC,"I started watching BG during the third season and I found it to be very entertaining. I have since watched both the first and second season, which, again, I thought were great. If you are looking for some creative TV storytelling, look no further, BG seasons 1-3 fit the bill nicely. The only catch is that, after awhile, you will begin to notice that there are a number of loose-ends piling up. These are the result of some serious flaws in the plot and subplots. Unfortunately, by the time you get to season 4.5, the show has gone completely off the rails and is, in my opinion, unwatchable, (I tried to give it NO stars but Amazon won't let me). It's sad really but to be expected given the implausibility of the storyline. Don't get me wrong, implausibility is not a 'bad' thing but it will come back to haunt you if you don't deal with it properly, or, you don't respect its ability to ruin a good story. That's kinda what happens here. In my opinion BG ""jumped the shark"" sometime in the season 4, (around the time when Starbuck comes back to life). Afterward, like all good shows gone bad, the story deteriorates rapidly, along with our patience. I couldn't get through episode one of 4.5. For three days I tried to finish it and I just couldn't do it. The characters are all caricatures of themselves, like warped reflections in a funhouse mirror, but in this case, the results are not funny. Like I said, it's sad, especially when one considers the quality of talent that is on the screen. In any case, my advice is to avoid this and season 4 at all costs. That way you your appreciation for BG 1-3 will remain, safely, in tact, and you won't have any regrets.",1287792000,2,1669,4.4397394136807815

When it's bad, it's ugly.

I never discovered this series until 3 weeks ago, and the reason I stayed away was the title: it was so geeky-sci-fi-stereotype-laden that I cringed and never got past the cover. However, upon hearing that Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer) unequivocally declared ""Battlestar Galactica"" as the BEST show on TV, I decided to check it out.

From the first 3 hr miniseries, I was obsessed. I fell in love with the dialogue, which was inspired. It's smart without being ""clever"" and real without being boring. The characters took a bit more time, but it wasn't long before I was thinking that Starbuck was one of the most grippingly worthwhile characters I have ever seen on TV--she maintains a real presence in my mind to this day. I couldn't quite put my finger on WHY it was so compelling to me at first--all I know is that I spent every free minute zooming through so that I finished it all in under 2 weeks. I was even a little depressed at the end because I knew there was no show I could go to next that would satisfy. (SPOILER ALERT!)

However.

The way Kara Thrace/Starbuck was put out to pasture at the end is the single most unsatisfactory element in my entire viewership of Battlestar Galactica. Yes, I understand that she was an angel whose destiny was to lead her fleet to present-day Earth. Yes, I understand that her relationship to Lee started out as ill-fated. Yes, I even understand (from what Ron Moore has said in several interviews) that her death was the one thing she had been running away from and would, therefore, be the one thing that she needed to conquer in order to be that great hero that she truly is. BUT. The fact that the writers felt the need to have her return as an angel, REGARDLESS OF THE REASONS FOR IT, was an underhanded thing to do. It was their having their cake and eating it too. They got to capitalize on Starbuck's overwhelming popularity, a popularity that's commanded by her LIVING, NON-ANGEL persona, and forced us to accept a deliberately unsatisfactory ending for her as payment for bringing her back. It's like Ayn Rand's second-raters holding the John Galts of the world hostage by their very own integrity. When did this become a writer-vs-viewer rivalry? Did the writers feel the need to outstrip their previous creative geniuses by zeroing in on the one area that they KNEW to be inviolate, and then proceeding to violate it? Was it really the overarching story that required her fake-death-return-but-not-real-return, or was it a case of being too clever for their own good? I honestly feel that it was a case of ""let's kill her off"" first and buyer's remorse later--and only after, when the episodes had already aired, does the writers' integrity kick in and they give the only dignified ending they could with the corner they'd painted themselves into. I think Ron Moore's stated claim of needing to kill off Starbuck to have her conquer her one overriding fear is also disingenuous; if you look at her progress through the series, you might observe that the one overriding fear she has is of trusting in her love for Lee and going for it. It makes sense when you layer it with her abusive mother's effect on her--more than the fear of death or ""being forgotten"". So, an ending where Lee and Kara get to be together in a real, human-human way would NOT be the syrupy ending that maybe Ron Moore disdained to associate his relentlessly dark series with: it would be Kara conquering that one overriding fear to fully be that hero.

I just had to get that off my chest. All the other trifling inconsistencies and unanswered questions--they come with the territory. This was damage done at the soul--the one thing that stuck in my craw.

My petition is this, should it ever reach the eyes or ears of the show's creators: if you ever see the truth in my words, would you pledge to remake the end of the show to reflect those changes?

DVD CONFUSION
-------------------------------------------------------
The show is incredible. However, the whole DVD thing has been a disaster. They released it in the worst way possible (see below), Amazon compounded the problem by lumping together reviews for DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, and the DVD manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some products. I cannot imagine how someone who is not deeply familiar with it is supposed to purchase this wonderful show. Certainly, they would hesitate to give it as a gift! Let's hope this solves your problem.

In one sentence, I can say that here is what you want to get: Seasons 1, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4.0, 4.5, and The Plan. I have links to them below. If you get these, then you will be sure to have it all.

========================================

OPTIONS FOR PURCHASING THEM ALL TOGETHER: BAD TO GOOD
-------------------------------------------------------
-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON). Not recommended. I do not own this, but according to the reviews, it is packaged poorly WITHOUT AN EPISODE LIST. That seems like a horrible idea for four seasons of a tv show. Apparently, it contains the same DVDs as the ones sold separately (explained above).
-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (the one in the GRAY BOX). *Recommended*. I do not own this. Good reviews of it so far. Packaging problems were fixed. According to a comment from Leif Sheppard, it does include The Plan.
-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON) [BLU-RAY] or the gray box [BLU-RAY] set. *Recommended*. I do not own this. Seems to include some extras, but not significant. It also has an episode list, according to the reviews. It might be worth buying if you wanted to get everything together.

BOTTOM LINE:
-------------------------------------------------------
As far as I can tell from the reviews, ONLY the Blu-Ray version contains everything you need. So, I think there are two choices:
(1) Buy the Blu-Ray set or the Gray DVD set.
(2) Purchase everything separately (make sure to get all of the stuff mentioned above).

NOTE:

-The ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes (episodes shown only online) have not been made available for purchase in any of the sets as far as I can tell. What a shame!

3646270,2,B001HZXYDC,"I wholeheartedly agree with fellow Amazon reviewer Nathan Beauchamp's assessment of Battlestar Galactica's fourth and final season-- a great disappointment in light of the promise this one stellar series once held in its initial season.

However, I felt compelled to write my own review to provide a more dispassionate response to Season Four than Beauchamp wrote so that I may provide a more clear-headed account as to why this final season was such a great disappointment to a not insignificant number of fans.

This review will contain many plot spoilers.  Be forewarned.

Firstly, the show always operated on a core principle of human survival.  At all costs, the human race must go on, even if it means sacrificing the innocent.  This concept was highlighted in Season 1 when President Laura Roslin ordered the civilian fleet capable of FTL to jump and abandon other civilian ships who were incapable of FTL jump to an imminent Cylon attack.  That moment encapsulated the show-- that human beings, who are moral creatures, must make terrible decisions that strongly contradict their moral conscience for the sake of survival.

Admiral William Adama violated this core principle significantly in the opener of Season Two, when he told his son Lee that ""..the price is too high."" to leave everyone behind in New Caprica, especially his love Laura Roslin.  That is a logically and emotionally acceptable exception clause to the hard and fast rule mentioned earlier about survival at all cost.  If the one person you care about in the entire universe is being held prisoner by the enemy, and over half of the human population is with them, you might wish to risk imminent death to save all of them.

However, Admiral Adama made the same decision again to violate the hard and fast rule of survival at all cost in the series finale of Season Four's ""Daybreak"" when he made the decision to rescue the cylon-hybrid Hera from enemy hands.  However, the justification he used to violate the hard and fast rule is weak and defies plausibility.  Given the logic and structure of the show [survival at all cost], not to mention common sense, there is no good reason to risk the lives of all of those men and women, nearly a third of the crew of Galactica, to rescue one child.  That decision, which acts as a catalyst for all of remaining action of the final episode, is deeply flawed from not just a storytelling point of view, but it seems to me from all points of views.  Thus, the strength of final episode is deeply hampered by this flawed decision which acts as an impetus for the rest of the episode.

Secondly, when Cavil holds Hera at gunpoint in the CIC of Galactica, Saul Tigh offers the Number One resurrection technology in exchange for the life of the child.  And Adama agrees.  I tried to hold back my own implosion of disbelief, but this drastically violated the hard and fast rule of survival.  Why would you allow an enemy that destroyed your entire race to the point of extinction access to their most feared technology, their ability to resurrect?  Ever since their escape from Cylon forces after the attack on Caprica at the very beginning of the series, the human fleet's most stirring victories have been the destruction of resurrection hubs which ultimately culminated in the destruction the resurrection central nexus itself.  And to erase all those hard worn victories now, all for the life of one child whose 'importance' is esoteric with no concrete proof at best?

As I watched this series conclude, I sympathize with Feelix Gaeta.  The world is upside down.  If I was one of the writers for Battlestar Galatica, I would have likewised mutinied much like Officer Gaeta and court marshaled BSG creator Ronald Moore for crimes against humanity.  The initial principles of the series when it first began were abandoned and betrayed in these pivotal scenes in the series finale.

There are many more gripes to say.  Kara Thrace-- who is she, how did she come back?  The show doesn't have an answer.  This is a terrible decision, to establish such a large question for such a central character and never resolve it-- akin to having an entire story arc be merely a 'dream' by a character in the 70's show ""Dallas"".

And yes-- absconding technology, technology capable of FTL travel, to settle a world that is warm and sunny until the food supplies runs out, is a startling decision.  And the 100% agreement of 300,000 people to all elect to become farmers.  Again, the absurdity is too obvious to warrant additional comments.

Lastly, and perhaps also equally disappointing than the violation of the survival rule, is the resolution of the ""angels"", the apparitions Caprica Six and Gaius Baltar see.  Gaius' angel said that he would lead humanity to their destruction:  that never came to pass.  And if God does indeed plant angels in our midst to help guide our destiny along, then what is his agenda or purpose?  Baltar said that God is not a moral entity so much as a force of nature; if that were true, then why send angels in our midst to direct the course of human history?

Too many internal logistical errors that crumble this once promising series.  I will choose to remember Battlestar Galactica for what it once was, and what it showed to be every now and then:  the great Season One and Two.  The arrival of Pegasus and how, even amidst annihilation, humans are still prone to infighting.  The prison escape of Season 3.  The mutiny of Season 4.

How, when the writing is good, it's damn good.  It's a no-nonsense kind of writing, the kind that is skeptical and scornful of esoteric and flowery speech, but at the same time so attuned and eloquent when ascertaining the nature of God [until Baltar claims God is a force of nature, which is erroneous even by the show's own internal logic.]  It's good writing, the kind that scorns Lee's ""I feel the weight of my guilt every time I look at my wife's face."" with Kara's quip, ""We don't have time for you to be poetical.""  The kind of writing that has Cavil saying, ""The hybrid is suppose to navigate the ship, not vomit metaphysics.""

That sentiment is exactly how I feel about how BSG turned out.  It was supposed to be a gritty, meat and potatoes kind of show, but with a soft heart that desperately sought out the nature of God.  What we got in the end is one that vomits metaphysics.  But, I will choose to remember BSG in her finer moments.  Like Adama said when the Chief was besmirching Callie's funeral, ""Don't do this to a memory.""  We should honor the memory of BSg when it was at its brilliance.",1272153600,4,6582,4.708041958041958
3646271,3,B001HZXYDC,"These final episodes were good (for the new series that is). I never cared much for Moore's version of the show, but every now and then a spark of good comes out of his version. Still not as good as the original, but worth buying if you've already got the other seasons on DVD or Blue-Ray.

The show's finale was a two-parter with part one being an hour long episode and part two being two hours long. Not much to offer in part one, but part two for the most part is excellent. The humans have their final battle with the Cylons, which is no doubt the best action-packed moments of the entire series, and finally find Earth. The show comes to a great conclusion.

3646272,5,B001HZXYDC,"One of the trends pioneered by America is the sanctifying of TV shows as national events.  First were the major sporting events such as the World Series games.  Then we had politics, such as the McCarthy hearings & the Nixon - Kennedy presidential debates.  This was soon followed by televised concerts; who can forget the Beatles first live performance in the US on national TV.  Finally, we get around to made for TV shows.  The groundbreaker here was I Love Lucy, with some of the more famous episodes being major milestones in TV history.  In the past 10 years, many cable/satellite shows have become major events also, with one of the biggest ones being the SciFi channel's incarnation of Battlestar Galactica.  Fans of the original show waited 3 decades for something like this, but got a lot more than expected.  Battlestar Galactica became one of the best TV serials of all time, and probably the best ever in the science fiction genre; handily beating out all the Star Trek incarnations, all the WB network creations, and probably besting Firefly.  Hence nothing was so awaited as the series finale.  All the themes were tied together, all the plot lines were finished.  Yes the humans reach earth, yes the battle with the cyclons is resolved, all mixed in with major characters being killed off along the way; something the original show never had the chutzpah to do.  And of course we have great battle scenes, both in space and hand-to-hand combat.  All told, a great series.  And as any good DVD set does, this set offers extended and deleted scenes that are worth watching.",1271289600,3,1587,4.786764705882353
3646273,5,B001HZXYDC,This was the last part to the Battlestar series from Sci Fi and it was sad to see it go.  Definitely a show that transitioned well from the original and made it cool again.

3646274,3,B001HZXYDC,"Battlestar Glaactica had been one of the best shows recently. the writing acting and directing was spectacular, plus it was a Sci-Fi series! Seasons 2 and 3 had been incredibly strong and a lot was expected from this final season which kind of got drawm out into two halves. The second half is somewhat of a let down. Way too much time is spent on the emotions of the characters, their conflicts and so on. While this was a strenght when there was a stronger basic story-line, here it becomes somewhat too much as the story is no longer completely clear. Let's say: they search for their hoome planet only to find it barren and then finally manage to find finally another one which is the real Earth. here the whole thing slightly unravels and one would have wanted a stronger ending. Also the fact that there are many ""movements"" among the Cylons, some of which are siding with the humans, even Cennturions, really stretches the imagination beyond what is possible. OK it is a Sci-Fi show so it is not allways entirely realistic but the do stretch it a bit. Globally technically the series remaion solid on all points except the conclusiona dn final story-line which have weakened. Probably this is to be expected when any series becomes unexpectedly popular and has trouble keeping up the quality until the end.",1270252800,2,1313,4.688311688311688

3646276,3,B001HZXYDC,"I have been a fan of Battlestar Galactica since the miniseries aired on Scifi. It has been a groundbreaking show with extraordinary quality in almost every aspect - including the intelligence and depth of the writing. In fact, I would likely give each and every season set before this one a five star rating. But I'm sure I'm not alone when I state that parts of season 4 (in particular Daybreak) are not the show's shining moments by any means.

Allow me to reduce the scope of this review to the specifics of 4.5. It starts out with the brilliant opening episode, which is an extremely dark and haunting elegy for our beloved Colonial Fleet. This one really almost assaults your psyche in its complete, crushing despair. The next three episodes are perhaps some of the best in the entire series. The mutiny arc, while perhaps a bit rushed, was absolutely brilliant. We find the same pulse-pounding action, moral relativity, and amazing production that we've come to know and love from this series. And while the next five episodes are nowhere near as good as this quartet of jewels, they do serve their purpose in answering questions and even occasionally producing Eureka moments (Someone To Watch Over Me, in particular).

Then we get to the final episode, Daybreak. Before I carefully explain how disappointing it was, let me lay some foundation. Since late in the first season, we've been treated not only to intriguing mysteries but also to arcane metaphysical hints to those mysteries in the form of hybrid monologues and scriptures. I personally spent a good deal of time after an episode analyzing these brilliantly written  passages for meaning, and I think it's safe to say that I found quite a bit of meaning. These aren't completely arbitrary messages, after all. Here, take a look at part of the monologue from Razor:

""The denial of the one true path, played out on a world not their own, will end soon enough. Soon there will be four, glorious in awakening, the pain of revelation bringing new clarity...and the fifth, still in shadow, will claw toward the light, hungering for redemption that will only come in the howl of terrible suffering. ""

Now, knowing what you know from past events, doesn't that sound like he's talking about New Caprica and the Final Five? Sure does to me. And if you examine the words of each hybrid you see on the show, you'll find their words similarly significant, albeit a little more difficult to decipher. But the main point I'm trying to get across here is that the show expended a significant amount of effort creating this web of complexity that it wanted its viewers to try and solve...and also that it promised to ""reveal"" on a regular basis. What did we get instead? One of the biggest Deus Ex Machinas I've ever seen! I feel like I've been Rick Rolled! I mean yes, the story is about the characters (as Ronald D. Moore's ridiculous epiphany states), but that's not all it's been about. The show has also been about politics, war, religion, terrorism, culture, society, morality, prophecy...all kinds of things. It is inexcusable for someone who wrote the pilot and has overseen the development of every script to use a false epiphany as an excuse to not deal with resolving the cans of worms that have been opened. We get a great big ""god did it!"" as our explanation. How enlightening. This show had more intelligence than that. That is why I say Daybreak is not a good example of the show I know and love. Sure, the writers threw in random mysteries like the Opera House without knowing themselves what it meant (and the effect was brilliant!)...but even when you have no plan, you can still manage to come up with a reasonable ending if you just set aside your laziness and think about what you've written so far.

To clarify, I've never had a problem with the religion in the show, nor have I had a problem with the insinuation that there was something to these prophecies and scriptures and ""head characters."" But with all of the complicated hints and theories that seemed to be floating around, I was convinced that a far more interesting explanation was awaiting us at the end of the show. But sadly, most of the fans came up with a better ending than RDM. I even wrote my own script for the last episode, and it was better than his. That's pretty sad.

Now Deus Ex Machina isn't the only thing that angered me. We're also treated with a preachy, overbearing message similar to the one I received when I went to see Avatar...only maybe a little worse. I can't stand preachy in any kind of writing, because the writer should have the good sense to cloak it in at least a little bit of subtlety. But of course, this is more personal taste than anything else.

Then there were the awful character resolutions. And of course the worst is that Starbuck just up and disappears. That's it. We have no idea where she went, why she disappeared (other than the fact that she ""completed her mission"" and is some sort of ""angel""). The characters did not behave the way that I expected them to, nor were the conclusions of their arcs satisfying in any way - dramatically, emotionally, intellectually...

The only good thing I can say about Daybreak (other than the things that remain completely consistent throughout the series: good scoring, acting, directing, editing, and cinematography) is that the battle was pretty well done, but even that suffered from lack of funds, from the looks of some of the shots.

So, bottom-line for this set: great start, horrible finish. But, I guess if you've made it this far, why not go all the way, right?",1268697600,4,5595,4.688391038696538

Most know what happens being that the series is almost a year over, so I won't go into details about it. My review is simply on the price of a half season. Like others paying a price of a full season and only getting a half season makes no sense. I like others were waiting for the price to come down at Amazon. A few different times it did and I missed out. Last night it was priced right around $24, which is better than before. A family issue arose that needed attending to so I postponed the online shopping until the next day. The price jumped back up to $40. So I went with a competitor that was still in the $24 range. Oh well. Lesson of the story---shop for the best price and be loyal to no one but yourself. Consumers are what make businesses work. Not the other way around.

The good.
The acting is very good as is the directing.
The writing is decent.
The characters become well developed and mostly believeable.
Best of all, dispite some crazy convoluted sub-plots, there is a story being told that has a beginning, a middle, and an ending.

The bad.
Often the show can`t seem to decide if it is space opera or soap opera. Then throw in a bunch of metaphysical gunk to really gum up
the works. All too often it seems that it`s the story line that is wondering in the wilderness instead of the characters.
While the over all story and the main plot line are not bad, it is rather drawn out. It could have been told better in half the

The acting is great, direction is fine, cinematography is beautiful, but these don't make up for an atrocious story line. I feel cheated after watching season 4.5. What I thought was a Sci-fi show turned out to be a show advocating religion. Everything, I mean everything is supposed to be God's plan, a plan that has no reason or logic and cannot be questioned.

Sure the Cylons spoke of their God all the time in previous seasons, but I thought those were the writers/narrators' commentary on religion, not to be taken literally. Now to my horror Season 4.5 made it clear the narrators/writers actually meant it when they spoke of god through the cylons. After season 4.5 when I revisit previous dialogues on god, they took on new meaning. And we are to believe the ""ghosts"" of Baltar and Six we saw throughout the show were literally angels, along with Starbuck. This puts a religious undertone on all previous seasons and RUINED THEM ALL for me.

Then there's the obligatory bashing of technology when a writer runs out of original ideas. These liberal art majors, while reaping the rewards of advances in technology, they never understand technology, never worked for it, yet somehow they think they've got the licence to bash it.

No real insight or wisdom about life or the universe. Just some drivel of some religious nuts. Pity. Lame.",1262995200,6,1359,4.819742489270387

3646294,1,B001HZXYDC,"This season promised to be the best, most gripping, of all in the saga of the ""Old Man"" & the Cylons.  And it was, UNTIL the very last episodes.  I do not want to spoil it but, after a pivotal mutiny took place in Galactica, it all went downhill for me: I couldn't believe what some characters did in these episodes, turning a sharp 180 degrees on all of what they were suppossed to be - then, I just didn't care, really!  Can't go into specificks but, suffice to say that the humans showed their true colours, especially Adama, who lost ALL credibility - his words & actions sounding so hollow & hypocritical from then on - spewing forth ""righteous anger"" & stances about ""honour.""  What a poseur!  To put it mildly, I wanted him (& all his cronies), to die in every second of airtime he had afterwards, just to get rid of the bastard.  I just couldn't watch it anymore; the show made me ill with anger, to say the least... And I just did because I wanted just to see if that pr*ck & the rest of his lobotomised/hypocritical minions got their comeuppance... Well, it seems that this series really portrays humans as the petty, servile & loathsome creatures they can become, betraying all their vaunted ""ideals"" for the next big, shiny ""thing,"" breaking all their ""honorable"" codes/modifying their paradigms & values at the drop of a hat.

Also, after Starbuck wanted to pick a fight with a cripple (after insulting him & humilliating him), my hatred of her knew no bounds.  Her ""ending"" was absolutely unsatisfying - it's ""mystery"" only served to infuriate me more at the writers whom couldn't come up with a satisfying finale for her (even a mediocre finale).  It reminded me of hacks with no talent.  I guess they thought it was ""cooler"" this way, thus treating Galactica's audience like morons.

Even worse, the end episode was FULL of the usual bad scifi clichs - the very things Galactica was supposed to get rid of.  All of it's ""twists"" & ""surprises"" could be seen coming from miles away.  By the time the last scene finished I was zzzzsleeping.  It's beyond me why did they dropped the ball so badly in the ""4.5 season""... Maybe they just didn't care since they got their paychecks, I don't know.  It reminded me of a very trite & awful Space Opera - even campy (like Episodes 1, 2, 3 of Star Wars)!  If you're a fan, please stop watching when the Pegasus makes it's entrance...

3646297,4,B001HZXYDC,"With all the shows that tend to last well beyond their creative peak, I think it was refreshing that a show chose to end a mere four seasons into its run.  The trouble with ending so early, is everyone is expecting a conclusion that perfectly wraps up eveything.  So, when you're in the last ten episodes of 4.5, every episode is expected to provide more clarity and conclude the mysteries we've all wanted solved for so long.  Sadly this did not happen.  Certain mysteries were resolved, while other were not.  This led to a strong divide amongst the fans as to the merits of the last ten episodes.  The reality is, if they are judged on their own, and not merely as a conclusion, it is still very strong.  The mutiny story worked very well, as did the very very dark reactions to finding ""earth.""  Sadly, there were a few episodes toward the end where nothing happened, either being answered or in terms of story.  Ordinarly this would be just the same old BSG, but the audience wanted a conclusion.  So, as conclusion, the last ten episodes were a disapointment, leaving many stories hanging, but as a show on its own merits, they were very good (mostly) and are worth watching.",1259107200,,1181,4.5545023696682465
3646298,1,B001HZXYDC,"Not much to say that others haven't said already.  This began as a great series and ended as a maudlin soap opera.  J.D. Salinger described sentimentality as (I'm paraphrasing) loving a character more than God loves him; that seems to sum up much of what went wrong with this series.  The creators apparently believe that every little pang of angst their characters feel deserves an episode's (well, many, in fact) worth of development.  Turning Starbuck into an angel is an extreme example of this.  Clearly, the show's creators love her, but she is a selfish, maladjusted annoying character from the second season to the very end.  Struggling through the series, I found myself time and again groaning inwardly, thinking, ""Oh no.  Starbuck's emoting again.""

The ending could not be more implausible. They finally reach a planet that isn't earth (which of course has been destroyed) but which they call earth.  They abandon all their technology--just like that--all their medicine, tools, and so on, to live like the natives.  They have no apparent skills that will allow them to adopt a stone-age existence, but we are led to believe they do.  Furthermore, instead of sticking together to rely on one another and perhaps protect themselves against natives that might or might not be hostile, they scatter.  Sorry, folks, but intelligent people would not do this.

I kept watching this series hoping that it would regain some of its original glory. (Also, frankly, I wanted to know how it ended.)  When BSG started, the writers/creators maintained the right balance between personal drama and action.

i think this is the best show ever on TV.the writing remained strong , creative, and thought provoking the entire series. the political and metaphysical questions it posed are without a doubt the most adventurous ever put to the small screen. the characters were given traits that made us love and hate them. there was little black or white in the questions this show raised or with its characters. we learned much and questioned much about the human, and or cylon race as we watched. which one did WE come from anyway?
  many of the shows and their production values exceed anything we see in the theater these days. the last episode, watch the entire disc as one, is probably the greatest single endeavor ever on tv. i am sorry to see it over, but it ended as it should.
i highly suggest you buy this entire series and watch it from beginning to end. question YOUR humanity while the crew tries to keep theirs. the noble acts and the atrocities...we are capable of it all.

  I was so excited to see BG on BluRay, I was disappointed I had already purchased too many seasons on DVD to justify getting the entire series on Bluray, so this was my only option to get a season I didn't have. (Although other seasons look GREAT when the DVD version is Upscaled!!)
  Oh my God I was so disappointed with the BluRay :( I don't know where to start.
  The beginning...I put the first Disk in the player and waited with anticipation for the splash screen. It came up..Crystal clear digital lettering, a nice interface. But in the side window, the worst, ugliest video played. It was like looking at 2 different standards.  I thought, ""My God its like watching a TV station from 100 miles away"". The picture was grainy, the colors washed out, it had static. Is this the look they were going for? It made no sense.
  I tried playing an episode.
Oh Great, every time you play an episode, Moore has to pop his head up again giving you his 10 minute dissertation on how great this is going to look. HE is digitally clear, bright and the color saturation is perfect!
  Then the episode starts. GRAINY, WASHED OUT, TINTED. I tried it in the BluRay and the PS3...Same thing. I wanted to give Moore a slap on his face for the incessant boasting!
  I decided there must be a problem with my setup. So I took it to BestBuy.  They told me it had to be my $5 HDMI cable. But it looked exactly the same on their $50 Dynex cable (who pays $50 for Dynex anything?) Even their better cables, same thing! Even they had to admit, it wasn't pretty! I thpought he was joking in the commentary, but now I think it actaully was shot with a Retail Store cam.
  That is just part of the problem. As I mentioned before this irritating intro by Moore comes up every time you do something with the disk. And its like he is laughing at you for being a sucker and paying the extra 10 bucks or more. He should be apologizing!
  Also, when you are watching an episode and you realize you have seen this one already, you can't exit to the main menu. I had to reboot the disk on the Sharp player and the PS3. You are trapped in the episode! Sometimes it just goes blank at the end of the episode and the player can't even shut down. I never had that happen with any other BluRay.
  With all this, I won't even go into his wife's babbling and child worship on the commentary track. That one kid of their's should be named PatPat (I swear its the kid version of the guy from Sat. Night Live. Somebody get this kid a nutritionist...please!). And I don't have much appreciation for Moore's cursing on the commentary either. Just doesn't add anything to the content for me.

3646303,4,B001HZXYDC,"Spoilers dead ahead!!

Sure, we'd like to know why Hera was so important; if Kara already knew the notes and the jump coordinates, why would she need them from Hera?  and if Hera is part Cylon, wouldn't it show up if the archaeologists 150,000 years hence did an exam of her skeleton?  If Kara was said to be the harbinger of death, what came of that?  How did she just disappear into thin air?  Does Bill Adama really want to live out his life in a cabin all alone with Laura's grave nearby?  If you had some tech, would you really want to abandon it and live primitively when you don't need to?  And why would the primitive tribesmen want to mingle with you at all unless it was to kill you?

You can put the above aside, to a degree, however, and enjoy the most unpredictable, questioning, darkest, most daring series that's been on TV in quite some time.  The cast is superb, with James  Callis, McDonnell, and Olmos standing out the most.  The ship is realistically breaking up and dying of age and damage instead of magically being put back together again as it would have been in Trek or other series.  The producers and writers also will not let people just ride off happily into the sunset; the fact is that what we seek isn't always what we had hoped we would find; sometimes things do not work out in the end; and you have to wonder if the human species really deserves to survive at all.",1256515200,,1399,4.338461538461538

3646307,3,B001HZXYDC,"After the greatest dissapointment of Season Three (in my humble opinion), I decided to not watch Season Four. But, heck, I could not resits the curiosity and bought both halves of the season.

First of all, I'd like to say that, no matter what TV show it is, it's simply not possible for the producers to release masterpiece after masterpiece episode. It just doesn't work that way. Time schedule is unbeliavable tight, the ratings pressure everybody all the time, there can be internal negotiations for cast and crew salaries, etc, etc, etc... So, the producers simply aim for the best. But there's no guaranteee that it will be the best. Otherwise, we coould not voice our opinions that ""seasons 3 and 4 of that show are the best""

That said, even acknoledging that Ronald Mooore, Jane Espenson (from Buffy)and team tried their best, there are some plot decisions that make you think: ""this is simple arrogance"". Meaning: the producers start to think: ""We can make any twists and write anything we want, because our show is brilliant and flawless. People will love it"". Wrong.

This happened with Galactica. From  a breathtaking sci-fi/drama TV show, packed with mind-numbing action and tension, without forgetting about character development, it turned into a unbashed space soap opera. Up until the middle of this season, things had potential. The mutiny episodes were nail-bitting, the demise of lovely Gaeta (although reasonably fair by military standards) was a shock, things were going well.

Then, suddenly, we enter into full soap opera mode. Yes, I agree, Ellen as the fifth cylon was lame, lame, lame, lame. If they did not have spent all the first half of the season saying ""one is to be revealed"", it was ok. But they build such a hype, that the disclosure, no matter how good it could have been, was a let down. Then we have the ""Hera"" situation, again an old plot used all around in sitcoms.

But the real, real sin was: by explaining everything (well, almost everything) due to sobrenatural reasons (God), the show made us feel like fools. A lot, (I mean, a LOT) of things that happened in apst episodes were rendered useless. It practically turned the last seasons impossible to watch again.

Anyway, I prefer to remember this show as a great one, where Edward James Olmos clearly had the role of his life and gave his best. Sure, Seasons 3 and 4 had a lot of bad moments, but a lto of great ones also and, in the long run, it was something very special.",1253318400,,2472,4.734883720930233

Ever since the the mini series, where the Humanoid Cylon copies marched in with Boomer at the end, I have been anticipating every single episode. Of course, not all are top-notch in the story. Certainly the third season has some weak moments, as the procuders wanted to have more stand-alone episodes. Luckely they've abandonned that idea in the fourth season and continued with the story arc as is should be.

The DVD contains a number of extra's, some docu-type stuff but most notably a few extended episodes. That alone makes the price worthwhile!

Warning...spoilers ahead!

Seriously, don't read ahead unless you've already seen it.

Fairly warned be ye!

I'll admit that I watched season 4.5 just to see how this incredibly intense and well acted series would end.  Other than the series finale, I think the most memorable episodes involved the mutiny and the retaking of the ship. And, the rebel cylons and humans slowly learning to work together to build a new community of survivors out of two previously warring civilizations gave me hope that Galactica would end on a really profound and inspiring note.

Wow, was I wrong!

Now, the acting was first rate, as were the visual effects.  Obviously there were some very talented and committed people working on this show, and I suppose that's why I stayed around to the bitter end.  But in the end I was the bitter one because of the way the story ended, not because of the talent involved in bringing the story to the screen.

""There must be some kind of way out of here"" seems to be the theme song for the people who wrote the end to this saga.  So, how do we wrap this up?

How about having one of the most important characters during the entire series simply vanish?  Problem solved!

How about the cylon drones, who have never shown any hint of genuine independent thought through the entire series, just take that cylon base ship for themsleves to discover their own destiny?  Since when does a cylon drone trooper care about a destiny anyway?

And, to be fair, I figured the president would die, and I thought that was well done.

And what about Jimi Hendrix anyway?  Now that we know the whole saga happened 150,000 years ago, what was his music doing reverberating around the galaxy back then?  Now, someone might say that Galactica went 150,000 years into the past when it light up the FTL at the wormhole, but the rest of the fleet didn't go through the wormhole, so it must have all happened 150,000 years ago, so what was Hendrix's music doing back there?  I suppose his music really is timeless!  I remember when that started happening earlier in the series and remembering how I thought, ""Oh no, it's going to get really dumb.""  And, it did.

But above all, it was the brain-dead nihilistic message the story ended on that really disappointed me.  So, the humans and ""human cylons"" decide to ""end the cycle of violence"" by giving the cylons that are farthest from human the most advanced technology, sending them on their way, and then reverting to subsistance agriculture.  Did Adama and his crew make this decision when they were sober or drunk?

Technology is our problem, folks.  It's ""run amok"".  If we just gave it up and went back to farming everything would be great and we'd all be wonderful people, right?  There is no good or evil, just a ""cycle of violence"" that would end if we just reverted back to a pre-industrial society where half of our children died in their first few years of life and we were constantly fighting with nature for survival.  Why didn't they just play John Lennon's ""Imagine"" as they flew the fleet into the sun?

Personally, I'll take the technology and the risks that come with it.  I would have set up a single city called New New Caprica and put those cylon drone troopers to work raising crops, and kept that cylon base ship in orbit for research and protection.  But that's just me.  I'm not one of the enlightened Politically Correct elite that are so civilized that they don't value civilization anymore.

The real message of this reimagined Battlestar Galactica is not that our technology is ahead of our morals.  They had to actually tell us that in the script.  But what seems obvious to me, and what they said implicitely, is that entertainment technology has outstripped the ability of writers to create an inspiring story.",1252800000,5,4164,4.697513812154696

3646317,3,B001HZXYDC,This is a great series but it could have been condensed into one season.  Most of the dialog is circular and the theme repetitive.  It is clear that the producers preyed on the loyalty of the scifi fans to milk 4 seasons out of a simple plot.  The most obvious defect is the prolonged dialog with the characters and lack of significant action.  Action is what scifi fans like most.  I did rate this 3 stars as a die hard scifi fan and respect for the origional series which by the way was great.  If you think this is a 5 star series then you have ignored the hours of dry dialog that has nothing to do with the lost souls in pursuit of their home.,1252713600,2,648,4.103174603174603

I wish they could have continued it. For me, four years was not enough. And, selling the split seasons - made each year, relative to other series available on DVD, pretty expensive.

3646323,4,B001HZXYDC,"Like many BSG Re-imagined fans, part of my growing-up was watching the original TV series (1978-79) as that story line developed, lurched around, rresumed (1980), and then came to a grinding halt; never fully satisfied with the end game.  Initially, the BSG Miniseries (2003) and then Season 1 (2004) seemed just weird and unfaithful to the original, but with repeated showings on SciFi (now SyFy) it became an acquired taste, and then eventually an addiction.  Friday Nights became planned around BSG airings.  Eventually Seasons 1 through 4.0 became available on DVD editions as the only available near-HD format for collecting - until Season 4.5 became available.  This presented a bit of an irritating dilemma for Season 4.5: buy it in DVD format to physically match the previous seasons, or buy it in Blu Ray to get the latest HiDef version.  I chose the Blu Ray edition.

Unfortunately the packaging for the Blu-Ray BSG discs is rather bizarre.  The DVDs came in nice, orderly, single-disc individual cases packaged in a boxed set, around 5 discs cases per box - nice and organized.  The 4.5 Blu-Ray discs came in a single folding case with 3 discs mounted on spindles, and Disc 3 is sort of offset but underneath Disc 2, so you have to remove Disc 2 and set it aside to get to Disc 3.  It gets my vote for Worst Packaging Ever - very inconvenient to use, at least relative to the orderly DVD box sets.  It makes me wish i had chosen the DVD version of 4.5, which (presumably) nicely matches in style and packaging format with the other DVDs.

The Blu-Ray discs play just fine, meeting all expectations of the HD Blu Ray format.  The previous season DVDs also play very nicely on a high quality Blu Ray player which does the proper upscaling.  I do not see any significant and compelling advantages in replacing previous BSG DVDs with Blu Ray versions.  Again - I am 50-50 on purchasing Season 4.5 as a stand-alone Blu Ray edition.  I would have been much happier if the disc packaging had matched the form and convenience of the DVD sets.  If I had not been purchasing the DVDs all along in previous seasons, I might have held off and gotten all of them in the Blu Ray format when that became an option after Season 4.5.

As far as content - if you were happy with the re-imagined BSG series and finale, then you will be happy with either the DVDs or the Blu Ray discs themselves.  Mix and Matching though (as I did) is not very optimal, and I strongly prefer the convenience of the original DVD set packaging over the complexity and inconvenience of the newer Season 4.5 Blu Ray disc packaging.  How hard would it have been to match?

Nitpicking at the inconvenient packaging aside, the re-imagined BSG series is epic, and the Blu ray edition is crystal clear (notwithstanding the production itself, which was always notable for sometimes grainy, shifty camera angles and such for a dynamic, ""live"" effect), and occasionally stunning, particularly when watching massive explosions and such frame-by-frame in ""war scenes"".",1252713600,2,3029,4.722433460076045

I'm sure the fear that there would be no further episodes pushed the team to find a degree of closure in finding Earth in a hurry and by writing things like Mr. Gaeta's line, ""known constellations are a match."" Combine that with referring to actual names for the constellations (i.e. Sagittarius instead of Sagittarion) as their ""ancient names"" in the tomb of Athena in Season 2, killing off your heroine without a concrete plan to explain her return, and pigeonholing the writers into finding a planet to call Earth at the series end, and the result of trying to end the show a second time without the plan that guided Mr. Moore thus far may as well include Fonzie water-skiing.

These abundant, but individually forgivable issues turn into major plot holes when the second Earth, our Earth that we are standing on now, is not the one they were referring to all along. They chose to show that the second Earth was truly ours with our continents, and even our Times Square... but apparently our real constellations are something of a paradox as both planets wouldn't have the same view of them. The names of the colonials' ancient constellations of the past somehow was to spring up again to become terms from our ancient past rather than their modernized versions of the words. By placing them 150,000 years in the past, we guarantee that absolutely no one from the fleet will successfully teach mankind living on Earth anything about civilization, language, or culture, as the sloppy time-line is set about 100,000 years too early for that to be a possibility. Not even Hera/mitochondrial Eve gets a happy ending as her life ended quite young according to National Geographic. Most of the continents that the 30,000 spaceship-dwelling survivors would have dispersed between were devoid of humans or protection, yet they chose to leave every trace of their technology and conveniences on a collision course with the Sun. If it is not the logic or minutiae of these incongruous events that should give a viewer pause, than it is the abandonment of the ultra-realistic characters' personalities and souls that should concern us.

Admiral Adama chose to leave his only surviving family member behind for good after spending the last 4 years trying to keep him close; his son is left alone to ""explore"" the globe on foot after his soul-mate turns out to be no different than Harvey the pooka, vanishing into thin air.

Albeit the first go at finding Earth left us with empty stomachs, but at least it retained a semblance of dignity for the exceptional staff that tirelessly worked on BSG for almost 5 years.

Let me make this clear: I love Battlestar Galactica. It had an incredible run, which included countless moments of brilliance and art from its amazing actors, inspired directors, and visionary writers. Unfortunately, as BSG has told us on numerous occasions through its plot lines, those visionaries can be wrong; can let us down. Ultimately, it is up to us to carry on and decide what makes sense for ourselves rather than listening to those who would rather drop the ball at the finish line rather than following Starbuck's mantra of ""fight 'em until we can't.""

3646328,2,B001HZXYDC,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. Don't read it if you have not watched the final season.

IT ALSO CONTAINS CYNICISM BORN OF CRUSHED EXPECTATIONS. If you don't like cynicism in general, take a pass.

IF YOU DON'T LIKE READING REVIEWS FROM PEOPLE YOU DISAGREE WITH (assuming you loved the ending) skip it entirely.

TO ALL OTHERS: READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

TO THOSE WHO AGREE THAT THE SHOW ENDED IN DISASTER: my heart goes out to you. It really does.

Remember the first season of Battlestar? When the Cylons were truly menacing? Inhuman enough to snap a baby's neck, resolved enough to nuke countless worlds into oblivion, and coldly calculating enough to track the Galactica across vast swathes of space, showing up with robotic precision exactly every 33 minutes? Remember how compellingly frightening they were, an antagonist that was easy to hate, to fear, to even dread? I remember watching that first season and being immeasurably impressed with the quality of the show, with the compelling characters, with the sci-fi elements, with everything that was Other about the Cylons, and the promise of a show that entered the spiritual and hard science fiction realms with deft ease. I remember the promise of the show: the potential to be THE BEST science fiction tv show ever created.

4 years later, is that what those who fell in love with the show received? Did the promise of Battlestar come to fruition? Tragically the answer is no. Not just no but NOT EVEN CLOSE.

Over a few seasons the show progressed away from excellence and originality and toward a banality and insignificance epitomized by the conclusion--if you can call it that since many things were never properly concluded. Cylons became humans, humans became Cylons, and all that made them distinct and interesting as parallels of one another or opposite sides of a spectrum, or beautifully constructed antagonists was lost in the process. I'm reminded of a story of the worst trade in baseball history in which a minor league team traded all of its players to another team for all of their players. The other team was their arch rivals, and it left all of their fans unsure if they should be cheering for the players that they had come to love, or for their team which was now comprised of players they had loved to hate...

Essentially this is what Batlestar delivered, a blurring of the lines to the point of causing this viewer to ask, ""who cares?"" Honestly, who cares if the humans/Cylons/humans/hybrids survive? Haven't they all just become the same thing anyway? Who cares about Cavel and his petty obsessional sadism? Who cares about Adama and all his rage over Saul or Kara, or anyone else for that matter? There is nothing left to care about except individual characters 'tempest in a tea cup' emotional outbursts and petty infighting. The show lost its way in Season III and never recovered--you can only care about your protagonists in the light of their antagonists, and when those two things stop being distinct, the wheels fall off. This is a concept known to storytellers of all generations, and it amazes this viewer that the writers could get this so painfully, ineptly wrong.

And to add insult to injury, all that was built into most of the characters that we DID care deeply about, all that made Kara Thrace who she is and was, all the questions about what it meant that she returned, that she came back from the dead, the implications of that were all swept away in probably the single most unfulfilling moment in the show. Why did she paint the future as a child and as an adult? Why did she return from death? How does she find the real location of earth using a song that her father taught her and that Anders is able to help decode? What does it all mean? We never get to know because... Kara vanishes. Poof. End of line.

The fleet finds Earth, and what do they decide to do? Destroy all their ships and technology? Please. I hope they all realized they now get to be subsistence dirt farmers without the aid of modern tools (or even ancient tools since I doubt that useful things like animal husbandry, crop cultivation and specialization, basic meteorology, navigation, and a whole host of other essentials to even ancient civilizations are skill sets of a space faring race that has just spent a few years scurrying across the galaxy). I hope the massive number of thugs that resided on some of the ships were all good boys and girls and turned in their fire arms or we all know how this will end. Honestly the idea that you can get 30,000+ people to 100% to agree on ANYTHING is just stupid and especially something that catastrophically life changing. Did anyone bother to keep a still or two, because it not there are going to be some VERY unhappy residents. Like Saul. Or his godawful wife.

The 30,000+ survivors of humanity's near total destruction also decide that separating into small groups and each taking a continent is a good plan? I guess being isolated from larger society in the confines of a ship convinced them that what they really wanted once the war was over was to stay separated? Adama so much so that he decides to live the life of a hermit, ignoring the first chance he's had to spend quality time with his son Lee?

Is this really what these guys were fighting so hard to survive for? Giving up all they knew and spending several hundred thousand years living lives that Hobbes might describe as ""nasty, brutish, and short""? All their culture, society, inventions, science, history, all swept away in a reactionary decision that was never even explained in the show? The engineers and scientist and teachers and historians and even the priests/priestesses told to drop everything and pursue survival (a full time job absent any real technology)?

New Earth turns out to be our Earth. We get a preachy message about robots and climate change. We learn that Hera is the mitochondrial mother of all the humans (in fact hybrids) that presently live on Earth. She was so important, so essential, so... disappointing? Does this cheap cop-out please anyone? Because if it does, I want to hear what your theories were when you were watching the show for the first time. Why was Hera so important? What about the prophecies about her, the shared vision of Kara, The President, Athena, etc... Were any of your theories that she would prove to be the mitochondrial mother of all humanity? I would be willing to bet that ANY of the things you thought up would have been a better resolution that what we were offered. Because it JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENSE. We were led to believe over 4 seasons that she was ESSENTIAL and VERY IMPORTANT and in-fact a lynch-pin around which anchored the show. Instead she became a silly foot note strapped on as the show breathed its last shuddering breaths and collapsed in on itself.

BSG is over. All our time and energy spent watching it, talking about it, thinking about it.

We feel, what exactly? Elated at the brilliance of the answers to the show's myriad questions? Fired up because against all odds the fleet made it to Earth? Introspective as we consider the profoundness of show's deeper subtexts?

Or are we wishing for that gun Cavel used to off himself so we can end the painful headache we've developed from asking the same question over and over and over again?

Why. Why did it have to end like this?

Remember when?",1252368000,62,7373,4.706749418153607
3646329,5,B001HZXYDC,"Okay, once again, I did not see BSG's final season on broadcast TV; I did see all the way through season 3 and then saw nothing afterward, until buying the whole series, which I watched from the beginning to get caught up, reminded and prepared for the final season. I review 4.0 elsewhere...

The second half of the final season picks up where we left off and continues the final arc of the story to Earth with an unexpected twist (no spoilers here). The revelations continue and many are not predicable, which I like. And they weren't stupid either, which I really like.

Without giving anything away, the final resolution did not take me by surprise as I had long ago surmised the way they would ""end"" the story, which is the only way it really could have been done.

After finishing, I thought back to some of the situations in previous episodes and seasons and saw the ""clues"", which were often hidden in plain sight. It's been a few weeks since I wrapped up watching the series and while at first it was a rather satisfying ending, now I find it left me a little wanting. Perhaps that is what they wanted. I can't say. But it was really the best ending possible.

The epilogue at the very end was unexpected and added a very interesting question to the whole cycle of events.

There is a bit of a hint of an upcoming movie ""The Plan"" that revisits the tag line in the opening, ""... and they have a plan..."" The producers admit it meant nothing at the outset, but became important as the series progressed. They realized the ominous tag line actually came back to bite them and they had to follow through. In the series, we learn of it in a way, but the film is supposed to flesh that out. And now that we know most everything we need to know, I'm sure there will be further surprises introduced as part of the ""back story""...

Think Asimov's Foundation Series books four, five and six. The Foundation Trilogy stood alone, but the added trilogy of books gave us more depth and understanding in retrospective fashion - we already knew the principles, now we learn more of their motivations, and what spurred them to do the thing they did.

If the production values hold up, it should be a good addition.",1252281600,3,2207,4.461538461538462
3646330,2,B001HZXYDC,"I have a theory that near the end of a successful show these days, the ""money producers"" pull all the more talented writers onto new projects and leave ""stock"" writers to finish up the show (that already has an insured audience) in any plodding, insipid way they see fit. BSG Seasons 4 and 4.5 serve as strong evidence for this unfortunate practice.

The first episodes of ""Caprica,"" or whatever other projects the ""good"" writers were redirected to, will be good television. I've had quite enough though, won't be fooled again, and won't be watching. It will be a long time before I spend time following another television show, as this treatment has killed many of my favorites over the last several years.

As I trudged through these final BSG shows on DVD, the distress of the actors at being shortchanged of good material was visible and palpable in their performances, as most of the beloved characters became paper-thin, uninteresting fractions of their previous charm. Unlike any of the previous seasons, I found myself watching most of 4 and 4.5 on high speed, and still yawned.

The edgy intelligent plots and plot devices are replaced with the most superficial tabloid level metaphysics imaginable in the final episodes, are we really watching BSG? or a rehash of ""Touched by an Angel?"" Truly a thumb in the eye to the faithful who gave this series its popularity through word-of-mouth raving over the first two seasons. As the audience, we have a vote in these matters, just avoid any further product generated by these people.

Already witnessed the untimely demise of what I had begun considering my absolute ALL TIME FAVORITE SHOW, bar none.  And like that it all changed.  Were this a show that didn't depend on a conclusion I would delude myself into thinking the series finale never happened.  But because the whole show leads up to what happens in the finale, its impossible to ignore.  Impossible to overlook the pimp slap so nonchalantly laid upon the faces of each and every Battlestar Galactica viewer.  Never forgive.  Never forget.

3646342,5,B001HZXYDC,"Not everyone watches the show when it airs, and if you're one of those people or if you'd just like to know what's on the discs, then this review is for you.

First, let me just say that I absolutely loved the finale. I also believe that the final half of season four was perhaps the strongest of the series (definitely the bleakest). This show had always been a drama with a scifi setting, and while some folks didn't like the fact that it became much more dialogue driven and less focused on action, I loved it. There are ten episodes (finale being a three-parter, but aired as two episodes, so you could say 11 episodes) spread across 3 discs. Here's a breakdown of the EXTRAS on each disc with my opinion of what's useful and what could have been airlocked.

Disc One:
""The Journey Ends: The Arrival"" is a look back at the series with the cast and crew. Worth watching.
""What the Frak is Going On With Battlestar Galactica"" is a quick 8-minute summary of the show through the first 3 seasons. It's concise and hilarious.
""A Disquiet Follows My Soul Unaired Extended Episode."" Better than the broadcast version, and definitely the version I'd recommend.
""Evolution of a Cue"" is a behind-the-scenes look at composer Bear McCreary's creation of music for a specific scene (with Roslin). It's incredibly detailed and if you're a fan of the music on BSG, I couldn't recommend this one enough. Actually, even if you're not a fan of the music it's still very interesting.

Disc Two:
""David Eick's Video Blogs"" is a collection of 11 3-5 minute video diaries with the cast and crew covering a range of topics. Some are funny and some are just fun to watch. Definitely worth watching.
""Islanded in a Stream of Stars Unaired Extended Episode."" Much better than the broadcast version. I wasn't a huge fan of this episode when it originally aired, but this extended version definitely fleshes out the story a lot better and also fills in a few gaps.

Disc Three:
""A Look Back"" is another collection of videos(6) with the cast and crew. Not repetitive in the least, this is also well worth watching.
""...And They Have A Plan"" is a quick 4-5 minute sneak peek at what the upcoming movie, ""The Plan"" is all about.
""The Musicians Behind Daybreak."" Bear McCreary is again on-hand to discuss what went into creating the epic score for the finale. Even better, we're introduced to the various musicians (and their instruments) who have worked on the score from the very beginning. And once again, this one comes HIGHLY recommended.
""Daybreak Unaired Extended Episode."" The finale the way it was meant to be seen. This contains all three parts, and along with extra scenes, it was also re-edited a bit. I highly recommend watching this and forgoing the broadcast version.

Across all discs you'll find deleted scenes (some are very interesting while some are just filler that should have been deleted, and they are presented in SD), audio and podcast commentaries (they're all worth a listen), along with U-Control. U-Control is an interactive feature that offers little facts about the show/characters which you can access as you watch an episode. Frankly, I found it completely useless. I haven't tried the BD-Live content as yet.

It should be noted that you should watch the entire series before watching any of the extras because they do contain massive spoilers.

There is, however, one glaring omission from this box-set: ""The Face Of The Enemy"" webisodes. While they are available elsewhere online, they should have been included in this set. They answer a question or two (from season 3) and greatly flesh out a certain character's motivations in these final episodes. I'd recommend finding and watching them before watching the episode, ""The Oath."" While this exclusion is noteworthy, the strength of the rest of the content in this set more than makes up for it. And perhaps we could see them available through BD-Live one day?

Visually, BSG looks gorgeous on Blu. You do notice the intentional grain a bit more at times, but colors pop and lines are well defined (CGI looks better as well). On the audio side, the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is simply fantastic. Technically, this set is remarkable.

If you've come along for the ride this far, there's absolutely no reason to not pick up this final half-season to see how this story ends. However, as to be expected, the finale won't please everyone. Whether or not you like it, at least we were given a proper conclusion, which is a rarity in today's television landscape. They told the story they wanted to tell, and left it up to their audience to decide...and that's exactly what I did.

A wonderful conclusion to the best show to ever grace our television screens.",1251417600,24,4718,4.770833333333333
3646343,4,B001HZXYDC,"After watching this season I was able to understand what was going on> I was pleased to see the writers put a good ending to a long story that I had enjoyed.
So many shows donot have an ending or are cut before a proper ending is shown.

3646344,5,B001HZXYDC,"OK, I'll admit to it, I REALLY like this show.  BSG has for the last 4 seasons, NEVER failed to deliver excellent dialog, First rate acting, GREAT Special FX, and an always interesting and plausible plot line.  For a Sci-Fi kinda show, plot line plausibility is as important as the acting, as they are both needed to produce excellence in this type of entertainment.  The good news for all of you interested in buying the finial 10 shows of the series is that all of this is here in the DVDs and Blu-Ray version of the shows.  Plus, the producers have added a great deal of behind-the-scenes, and added footage to make the purchase even more worthwhile.

I will add that no matter how terrific these last 10 shows may be, they don't take away the sadness that comes from missing any NEW production along the plot lines already established.

Buy BSG 4.5, you will NOT be disappointed in your decision.  I've all of the seasons from the ""Mini-Series"" & Season One Combo Pack, all the way through this last BSG 4.5.  This is the kind of show you can watch several times over and find something new and interesting each and every time you view the seasons.",1251072000,2,1152,4.5048076923076925
3646345,5,B001HZXYDC,"The writers, producers, directors, etc did a wonderful job building up to the series finale and the delivered when it counted. The entire series is beautifully filmed, even on board a mostly colorless warship, and the series finale is no exception. The final three episodes benefits from the creativity of flashbacks we've seen before and some flashbacks we haven't that provide new insights into primary characters. Some people will be upset by a few issues that aren't resolved definitively (Starbuck - but I loved it!) or the cheesy ""moral of the story"" ending, but too much is well told and well presented for that to matter.",1250985600,2,629,4.943396226415095
3646346,2,B001HZXYDC,"Okay where is the science in this show? It is suppose to be a science fiction show? It looked to me, more like a war story. Surely the producers could have hired a scientist to help them out and put some in.

At the start the series showed promise and I was hoping once it warned up it would get better like B5 did but instead this one went worse.

Like many stories, this one failed with the writers. The acting is quite good. I thought that Mary McDonnell played well as did Edward James Olmos. Also I liked the special effects too.

In 4.5, many scenes that were clearly suppose to move me did not. Several seemed a repeat of earlier ones in the show.

Nor did the ending make sense. No way would an advanced civilization allow itself to collapse back to pre-stone age. Why destroy the ships?",1250985600,4,795,4.28
3646347,5,B001HZXYDC,"Okay, so the question of Season 4.0 was ""who is the final cylon?""  Don't worry, you find out.  You're never going to guess who it is.

They're on Earth and trying to figure out how Earth is going to save them and yet it doesn't look like it.  We end up getting into a lot of development with characters, especially The Final Five and the Cylons.  We learn about their destinies and how it all fits and locks into Earth.

The ending to this series was amazing (though its not quite the end with Caprica and The Plan coming out).  I didn't see any of it coming and it had me in tears (and I'm not one to cry often).  It's heartbreaking, yet beautiful.  It leaves you feeling like BSG is over and yet there are possibilities still.  The ending also gives you the idea that maybe we're heading for the same destruction and future.  It's definitely something that makes you think.",1250899200,3,875,4.339506172839506
3646348,5,B001HZXYDC,"A serious sci-fi storytelling epic complimented by wizard special effects and complex character development enters its wind down to green pastures and still waters. And Gods afoot all along.  There are some shocking events and swashbuckling twists.  And the last leap is a real zinger.

I can understand some of the complaints about this last season.  Much of the story really is slow and visits some near-soap opera realm, committed to finishing out long storylines.  But the care given to guiding this adventure to its optimistic conclusion is as well crafted as all that has come before.  Hopefully, it can happen again as various spinoffs come to Galactica fans in the future.

I loved the magnificant, clear view of the dark continent before the reunited fleet, the bold assertion of classical gods playing in human affairs, the justice for former mechanical slaves and perhaps also the epic's concluding message for our modern age to cast off the great accumulation of things (material and cultural)--and simplify, simplify.",1250812800,3,1030,5.168674698795181
3646349,5,B001HZXYDC,"I missed the first 2 seasons of the show aside from the occasional one I caught when it aired, but never got into it, until the DVDs came out.

the story is well-executed and and the entire series plays out like a very long movie.

One thing I look for in TV or a movie is whether or not I can buy into the environment the producers are creating and with BSG I bought into it right away with the miniseries.

the writing is excellent, as is the acting, music, and special effects.
yeah, you can nitppick, but you can do that with any show.

with a few exceptions, I always appreciated the spiritual and philosophical aspects of the show and the fact that it leaves open a few questions for the audience to answer.

Season 4.5 picks up from the devastating cliffhanger that ended season 4.0 and gives us background into Cylon history for the most part and deals with the 5 final cylons and their reactions to knowing who and what they are. Incidents from past seasons come back bear on events in this season, sometimes with devastating results.

Apart from Daybreak, ""Islanded in a Stream of Stars"" is expanded as well as ""A Disquiet Follows My Soul.""

""The Oath"" and it's companion piece ""Blood on the Scales"" are full of riveting action and completes a couple character arcs and propels us to the end events of the series.

""Someone to Watch Over Me"" fleshes out Starbuck's destiny, but also gives us a nice, emotionally gripping piece with Boomer and Tyrol.

""Daybreak,"" the episode that ends the season is presented in the 2 part version that aired on TV, but it also presented as one 3 hour long cut, with footage added that goes a little deeper into character.  Daybreak features some of the most arresting TV ever done I think.

the show makes no apologies for what it is and I appreciated that.  Very good entertainment. with plenty of extras on the DVD to keep you occupied if you find yourself bored, including various commentaries.  :-)

the only gripe is that the DVD producers forgot to include the 2nd series of webisodes.

3646351,4,B001HZXYDC,"It is with much trepidation that I find myself writing this review after watching the last episode of season 4.5 last night.  I never watched BSG until last April when season 1 on DVD was loaned to me from a friend.  I was instantly hooked and have been blessed to pretty much watch the entire show all the way through in a matter of a few months.  I have just loved this show from the start.

But I must be honest and say that season 4.5 did not meet my expectations for how I thought this show would end and hence my trepidation in writing this review and giving it 4 stars.  As many reviewers have already pointed out - there have been a lot of questions left unanswered or the answers to some questions given simply were too simplistic if not kryptic.

To put it bluntly - the writers dropped the ball.  But I find I cannot give season 4.5 less than a 4 star review simply because the writing was the only issue I had with the show.  The acting talent/abilities of all involved is enough to give it a high review - particularly the talents of Mike Hogan (Col Saul Tigh) whom I thought was brilliant.  I had never heard of the guy before watching this show and from the beginning I have been extremely impressed with him and he peaks in season 4.5.  I truly believed Hogan was the best of the bunch and the bunch was really good.  Edward James Olmos (Adm Adama) was also incredible switching from the role of a strong almost untouchable leader to a man who privately gives in to his own emotion and feelings.  Olmos does an esxcellent job of playing the part.  I could go on and on and rave about all of the actors in this show - they all just blew me away.

Additionally the show's special effects and production were excellent.  The space battle scenes were breathtaking - particularly Galactica's last hora.  Everything looked believable - even the robotic cylons looked better in season 4.5 than they did at the beginning.

So despite the less than spectacular ending to this excellent series - I highly recommend it never-the-less.",1249776000,3,2039,4.438172043010753
3646352,1,B001HZXYDC,"This is something I posted over on the BSG: Complete Series Blu-Ray page, but I think it applies equally to the Season 4.5 page, as Universal made the same omission in both sets.

I was all set to buy the Battlestar Galactica: Complete Series Blu-Ray release, even though the thing is so expensive I was practically going to have to take out a second mortgage on my house to afford it. But for whatever reason, Universal has chosen not to include the Face of the Enemy webisodes on the Blu-Ray or DVD releases of Battlestar Galactica: Series 4.5 or Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series. Since I want a complete story, not just the parts Universal arbitrarily feels like sharing at the moment, I no longer intend to purchase the set. While this turn of events is actually to my financial advantage, I am disappointed nonetheless, as I was really looking forward to owning this show on Blu-Ray.

I know some would argue that the webisodes are still available online and I can watch them there. While that's true, why should I have to pay hundreds of dollars for a high-def Blu-Ray product that I'm going to watch on a large, flat-screen TV only to have to watch what is a (to some more than others) critical part of the story via a low-def YouTube clip on a tiny computer monitor? That seems to sort of miss the mark...

And to those who would say that the webisodes were not part of the series and therefore Universal isn't required to include them in a Complete Series release, you are technically correct; Universal can still slide by with calling this a ""Complete Series"" without the webisodes, since it includes every episode of the TV series proper. But that doesn't make it a complete story, which is what I'm looking for. Note that a few years ago, when Twin Peaks: Season 1 was released without the pilot movie (which was unavailable due to some really bizarre international licensing issues and not technically part of the first season), the set's packaging and promo materials were up-front about the pilot's absence; Universal has made no such concession, as they clearly want folks to be suckered into buying this without knowing that they are missing what equates to about a full episode's worth of story and some rather critical information about a character (particularly as it relates to actions that character takes later in the series, which some argue seem a bit out-of-character without the context of the webisodes).

So, Universal, thanks for saving me all that money, but maybe next time, instead of using so much of your own money to come up with that ridiculous disc packaging that so many people on here seem to despise, you'll put some of it towards overcoming whatever (I'm guessing) minor obstacles arose that precluded from including the webisodes and giving fans a complete story.

Just sayin'.

(P.S. I've heard rumblings that Universal plans to make the Face of the Enemy webisodes avaible via another means. I remain skeptical since the correct time for them to release this part of the story was with the Complete Series and 4.5 sets, and they've given no concrete evidence that they are really going to do this; if they were too lazy to do it when people were paying hundreds of dollars for a Complete Series set release, why would they do it for anything else? However, if Universal really does find a way to provide those who purchased these sets with Blu-Ray copies of the webisodes, I may change my opinion.)",1249776000,6,3452,4.735440931780366

BSG ended the way it had to end.  The travelers become our seeds.  The angst of the journey is secondary to the planting.  The personal stories were interesting but inconsequential to the big picture - the getting to Earth and being the trigger of intelligence.  Many religious philosophies were introduced and explored with no real answers.  God?  Gods?  A cosmic dice game?  Social issues hinging on personal diversity shaded each season but the end game just scattered the travelers to distant continents continuing the isolation of tribes.  The migratory tracing of the mitochondrial DNA of Eve that many of us have been following via the National Geographic Genome Project counters the premise set forth in the final episode.  But then, this is fiction. Sometimes while watching the series I forget.  That's how good BSG is as a whole.

Season 4 was a half season too long.  The producers and writers had to get from a strong Season 3 to the end and there was just not enough story line so too many hours were filled with battles and shoot'm ups.  There was too much back story in bars that added nothing to the overall account.  There was too much fluid running from Adama's mouth - did he have to brush his teeth twice in one episode and we won't mention the alley scene - it added nothing.

Brevity would have helped this final season but all in all it was a great series that all others should strive to emulate.  I admire the actors, the writing, the cinematography and the music will never be equaled.  Even the worst season of BSG (which 4.5 is) is better than most of what we see on the tube.

Now I never watched BSG while it was on tv. Kids and family make a set tv time hard for me. A friend told me to watch it after he had watched the last season. So I bought the pilot and watched it. I was hooked. Within a few weeks I had watched EVERY episode. I had to wait for a few months for season 4.5 to come out to see the end. It was worth it. This is one of the best character driven shows of all time and it is mixed with Sci Fi to boot. Yet it added just enough grit that I like in my Science fiction to make it all seem real. No miracle technology cures for every problem. Just good old human (sometimes Cylon) know how. I have told several people to watch this. They usually say, ""I don't like Sci Fi."" My response is, ""Yes, I know, that is why I am telling you to watch it."" I do not get the controversy over the ending. I thought it was perfect. I was devestated when they found Earth and it was a charred wreck. Little did I know that it wasn't our Earth. Everything, and I mean everything, worked out to a nice ending and I am usually left with some kind of buyers remorse when a show ends, not this one.

3646357,4,B001HZXYDC,"BLU-RAY vs HDTV vs DVD vs TV

It's true. I've seen it with my own balls. The picture quality of the blu-ray is the best way to experience the show. The blacks are deeper, richer, the colors more vibriant, everything is sharper. I watch on a 50"" panasonic plasma G10. The emotion on the actors faces, is more rich, more immediate, more human. On TV and HDTV the image is compressed, on DVD the image is soft. On blu-ray the image is as good as possible. It's not perfect. There's a lot of film grain in some shots. But most of the time the blu-ray advantage is absolutely worth it. It's not AAA, like Sin City or The Dark Knight, but it's a quality HD transfer.

THE STORYTELLING

Without spoilers, here's what I wished I would have known about this series before I started watching it. It has a master story arc, the plan, the heroes journey, etc... But I would guess that only about 25% of the episodes advance the story in a significant way. 75% of the episodes are almost stand-alone character dramas, set inside the world. If you expect every episode to advance the master plot, a lot of the episodes can feel too slow. If you know going in, expecting lots of side stories in an interesting hard-sciencce-fiction universe, then its easier to appreciate the character stories more, instead of just waiting for the next major revelation.",1249430400,2,1339,4.547717842323651

3646360,5,B001HZXYDC,"The absolute best television has to offer it's ever-gazing couch-potatoes.. I have never been more happy and heart-broken @ the same time.. @ least not with a tv show.. It broke so many boundaries.. and genres.. The story was enthralling.. dramatic, epic, nerve-wrecking & melancholic.. It encompasses past, present & future.. It's a post-apocalyptic militaristic cyberpunk space-opera testing the morality and logic of an age of fear.. and whether the human race deserves to survive.. I have never cared for characters in a story as much as I care for the characters of BSG.. Each character evolves and grows so much from beginning to end... Some of them discover who they really are.. Others can never go back to who they were.. The story ends so epically tragic, yet with a complete sense of closure.. and peace..

I feel like one of the only fans who really appreciated the way the differences between human and cylon were slowly peeled away in the ""soap opera' episodes that make up most of season 4.5.. The show has always been about the characters.. The cg'd space battles have always been top notch but that's not why you're watching.. The show has never been a flashy or glamorous everyday space-chase saga.. with sexy aliens and tazer gunz.. It's not star trek/wars.. It set out from the start.. dirty, raw and spartan.. but above all.. melodramatic.. Had the last season been all battle scenes and explosions.. I don't think BSG would have the same emotional resonance that it has.. The characters have always done more soul searching then space traveling.. It's always been an adventure of exhaustion.. not exhilaration.. Their journey into the universe ends within themselves.. and that's how it needed to end..

The negative reviews just irk me really.. I think, for those disappointed in the spiritual aspects of the shows finale.. It's important to remember this show has often been centered around faith.. They spent almost the entire series, putting all their hopes and dreams into the prophesies of a 2000 yr old religion(imagine that).  All the negative reviews spend a lot of time on the 'god' aspect.. but the show was never been subtle about religion.. NEVER.. So what were people expecting??.. Had they given us some finite explanation for everything.. it would have taken away from one of the major focal points of BSG.. faith.

Some think that the 'god aspect' was a cheap way to finish the story.  I just don't agree.

Best show ever... BSG will be missed..",1249257600,4,2484,4.902380952380953
3646361,1,B001HZXYDC,"I've had a chance to re-watch the entire series on DVD. Season 4.0 and 4.5 was a cornucopia of tedium.

The downward spiral began with the first hint of ""final five cylons"" in Season 3. As Season 4 develops, it becomes clear that the ""final five"" actors have to go back to their improv training days to get through this incredibly weak material. There is so much, silly, useless and incoherent standing around and emoting at each other by the Five, that I felt bad for these excellent actors. In the end, that's about all it turned out to be, a lot of standing around, staring at each other and not moving the narrative along. What was the point? How the heck, did the Final Five resurrect through the years, without the knowledge of the main body of cylons? As I watched Season 4, I found the answer to all my Final Five questions- it didn't matter, just filler. The significance of Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower""? I dunno, best guess, it was playing in the writers room, so stick it in there.

Character development was abandoned in Season 4.0/4.5. Plots were concluded with heavy handed devices, drawn from prior sci-fi and pop Eastern religions. It was a draining experience watching a great series fizzle.",1249171200,18,1214,4.641860465116279
3646362,2,B001HZXYDC,"I really enjoyed BSG, the unexpected plot developments, the philosophical issues involved in the metanarrative, the fighting, and even some of the romantic elements which I felt were not overdone.  Most of the individual story arcs were good, there were a few episodes that dragged however.  The character development was good.

Now for the bad:  Why would EVERYONE have decided to abandon technology?  And even if they had abandoned technology why abandon civilization?  It took them over 100,000 years to become civilized again?  Absurd.  There should still have been writing and basic craftsmanship, and yet, even with the most biased and liberal methods for deriving dates no one has pinned a date that old on any written document.  It does not square with anyone's idea of written history.  While I was glad the Agathons survived, I don't understand why Hera's Mitochondrial DNA would have become dominant to the point of her being declared Mitochondrial Eve.  And as to the Agathons settling in the area of Tanzania, there are no white or mongoloid (Asian) races or civilizations indigenous to sub-Saharan Africa.

When I first started watching the series I supposed when they mentioned they were looking for earth that they would reach modern earth.  At that point they would either assimilate and live at a more primitive level or perhaps have a conflict with modern man.  I assumed that assimilation was what would occur.  That was the obvious conclusion when they said they were looking for earth.  I was relieved when they found earth and it was destroyed because I assumed they would move onto higher things.  That assumption was based on the mystery surrounding the final cylons, the prophecies, and the visions.  The visions of the opera house were dismissed in a sloppy and anti-climactic fashion.  It did not involve a mysterious setting, reveal any secrets, or involve any action on the part of the final five.  The prophecies were left unaddressed, and ultimately the human and cylon civilizations were destroyed.  What was the point in that?  So instead of ending on a high note, it was almost like they just blew off writing an ending.  The series ends with thousands of years of barbarism and because of the barbarism none of the lessons were learned.  They reverted back to writing in the obvious ending, which was done in a sloppy and uninspired way.  The series ended with a whimper rather than a bang.  When they showed earth from space I almost felt sick and nearly turned it off, but the character development in previous seasons was done so well that I wanted to see what happened to the characters I had come to like.  The Agathons and Gaias Baltar were my favorites, so obviously I was pleased that they lived, although the pleasure was blunted by the fact that they would be lost in a sea of barbarism.

They never did reveal the source of the cylon religion, which they had when they were still metal robots.  They never said why the 13th tribe was nuked.  They implied that they nuked themselves but never stated why or how.  Why was Starbuck resurrected and how?  I also didn't like how they just cut Deanna out, right, she stayed on the ruined planet.  A poor way to write off her character.  And Leoban was cut out for almost the entire second half of the season.  I got the impression that they just wanted to terminate the series, so they rushed to close it and did so in a poor way as a result.

To sum it up, and obvious ending, with many abandoned plot lines which had the potential to be really great.  They ruined the series.  It would have been better if they ended the series with reaching the burnt out ""Earth,"" which was actually the real climax of the series, everything that followed was a downhill plunge into a blow off ending.

I found the ending so disappointing and anti-climactic that I will not be following Caprica.  I did hear that Edward James Olmos is supposedly going to be working on some sequels.  I only hope that if so then he manages to patch some of the plot holes and logical inconsistencies.",1249084800,7,4060,4.718349928876244
3646363,5,B001HZXYDC,"The final stretch of Battlestar Galactica has provoked a lot of controversy among fans of the show, creating a lot of polarized opinions with little middle ground. Rightly, most of the reviews here have focused on the series finale, but it's important to remember the other eight episodes before the finale, among which are some of Galactica's finest, and most gut-wrenching to date. 4.5 begins with the excellent ""Sometimes a Great Notion,"" detailing the fallout from season 4.0's finale ""Revelations"". ""Sometimes a Great Notion"" is one of the darkest episodes in the show's entire run, but also one of the best. Broody and bleak throughout, it is Galactica in its rawest form, pushing many characters past their breaking points to shocking consequences and major revelations (Such as the identity of the Final Cylon). The next three episodes are the high octane Mutiny arc, culminating in the climatic ""Blood on the Scales"". Galactica's focus on characters once again pays enormous storytelling dividends, allowing the writers to emotionally gut the audience as beloved characters commit heinous betrayals.  The last time Galactica touched this raw a nerve in me was during the episode ""Pegasus,"" which left me literally shaking with rage. From there, the series moves inexorably towards the finale. ""No Exit"" fills in the Cylon's back story quite nicely. ""Deadlock"" is really the only clunker in the set, dropping the ball on the final Cylon's return and the Tigh/Caprica Six relationship. Despite that, Galactica quickly returns to form with the hauntingly brilliant, ""Someone to Watch Over Me"". The last regular episode of the series, ""Islanded in a Stream of Stars,"" is a great character piece that gives us one last look at our favorite characters before they plunge into the abyss. Every one of these episodes, with the exception of ""Deadlock,"" represent Battlestar Galactica at its finest. Each one contains pieces of what made this show such a creative and critical success. I feel that recognition of that is lost in the furor that the finale caused.

""Daybreak,"" the series finale of Battlestar Galactica, seems to have become a love it or hate it proposition for fans. For my part, I loved it. I loved each and every moment of it. I've rarely been as moved by a work of fiction as I was when I saw ""Daybreak"". The characters, and the story, come to a beautiful conclusion that has lingered in my mind since I watched the episode months ago. In the end, I found what I was looking for in the finale, closure. What others are looking for may be different, or they may have a different definition of closure. In the end, the finale is going to mean different things to different people. For some, it was a colossal failure. For others, it was a pinnacle of storytelling. Viewers will have to judge for themselves. For my part, Battlestar Galactica will go down as one of the greatest works of fiction to grace the screen. Ron Moore and Company have created one for the ages. See for yourself.",1249084800,5,3002,4.895874263261296
3646364,5,B001HZXYDC,"This entire series was excellent! The ending however; left me sad and depressed! Nearly in tears due to the fate of some of the characters, and the mighty starships that pushed them to the stars. I feel choked up as I write this review! This has been a fantastic journey, from beginning to end. This saga should not end here!",1249084800,4,325,4.433333333333334
3646365,5,B001HZXYDC,"Battlestar Galactica's season 4.5 is the final season for the series, and we get it here in widescreen with Blu-ray's 1080p high definition and 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio. It's truly a treat to finally see this series as it was originally filmed.
The images sparkle and the richness of the contrast between light and dark really adds an extra punch to the scenes. Also added are extended episodes of three episodes, along with the originally aired episodes, including the three part finale shown without interruption.

It becomes more obvious how the various scenes were shot by comparing the softer interior shots of the Cylon base ship to the harsher, clearer scenes on the Battlestar Galactica. This adds an otherworldly quality to the scenes shot inside the Cylon ship which are contrasted with the sharp details of close-ups of Adama and others on the Battlestar Galactica that emphasizes a psychological immediacy. Perhaps this contrast in clarity can be said to accentuate the fact that the Cylon's world isn't the blood and guts world of the humans, and that the Cylons live in a sort of utopia. The human's world is fraught with the harsh reality of life and death struggles whereas the interiors of the Cylon ship are represented by the pristine, orderly world of soft, tranquil blinking patterns of lights, and water like streams of beaded light dripping down strands of veils. The Cylon's world represents a kind of idealized world whereas the human world is often portrayed  as disorderly, archaic, and dilapidated. This representation of the human world as a messy and complicated place is reflected in their various ideologies as well as in their pantheon of gods. Other techniques, from the steadier shots inside the Cylon ship, compared to the jumpy camera movements through the Battlestar Galactica's labyrinth of hallways, emphasizes these two different worlds.

In the final episode these two worlds are replaced with a natural, restful world where everything is seemingly in harmony. The humans vanquish themselves of their technology and attempt a new beginning in harmony with nature, though of course after a few days, or even a few nights of sleeping without the comforts of life, and being bitten by mosquitoes, the euphoria of being temporarily cleansed of civilization will begin to wear off, and the hard work will begin. People will try to make their lives more comfortable, and attempt to gain some control over their world. People will again invent tools and begin to make things. And so the cycle will repeat, or will it? Will there be a new permutation? What makes it so interesting to see this series on Blu-ray is to see how the cinematography accentuates these various aspects and points of view.

The very last scenes take us to our contemporary world. It seems the writers have again taken some liberties and have left us with some more perplexing questions as the final season has numerous leaps of logic and flights of fantasy not seen in the earlier seasons. At the very end, in our time, 150,000 years later, we see Number 6 and Baltar. Was Gaius Baltar a Cylon after all? How else could he be alive 150,000 years after the survivors of Battlestar Galactica landed on Earth, remembering everthing that has come before? If Cylons didn't die out wouldn't they have directed civilization differently? Apparently some things have changed since the last cycle given that Cylons already exist before humans have developed Cylons. But why then does everything look the same as our time right down to the buildings?
At the end is Kara Thrace shown to be an angel after all since she disappears into thin air? Or is Lee dreaming? If this was a ghost story then I would have suspended my disbelief, but this isn't the world that we were presented with in earlier seasons. Everything seemed to adhere to the natural world that we know. But in the final season there seems to be many amazing things that transpire. It is never explained how Number 6 and Baltar at one point can see the other's subconsious self, or why they even had these subconscious alter egos and no one else did, or how Number 6, Roslin, or Sharon, shared the same vision of the opera house and no one else does.  Kara is perhaps a ghost who also sees other ghosts, like the man (her father?) playing the piano who disappears when Kara is suddenly surrounded by members of the final five. Interestingly, there is a clip that shows a poster that advertises Kara's father performing at an opera house.
The last season lacks some of the clarity of earlier seasons, but through the overall strength of the characters, the high quality production, the immense creativity, and searing drama, these lapses don't sink the ship.

Perhaps one disappointing omission from this set is that there are no ""The Face of the Enemy"" webisodes included. In these webisodes Gaeta's past relationship to the Cylon model ""Sharon"" helps explain his distrust of Cylons. This leads eventually to Gaeta's treasonous ways as he teams up with Zarek against Adama.",1248998400,,5034,4.88187134502924
3646366,3,B001HZXYDC,"I totally agree with previous comments regarding this last and final year of Battlestar Galactica.

The first two seasons were so excellent that I could hardly wait for seasons 3 & 4 to come out on DVD.  Sadly - the peak of the series was Season 2 - with everything going downhill from there.

This is a case where writers so completely lost the story line - that - we - the viewers were left with nothing short of a Gordian Knot of puzzles and riddles at the end.

At the end - I wasn't sure whether I had just finished watching a science fiction film - or - a religious film - purporting Intelligent Design.

I had expected an ending - (perhaps) - along the lines of the Wachowski brothers' excellent trilogy - The Matrix - where - Baltar & Number (Caprica) 6 were - (perhaps) holographs - or - avatars.

But - then - more questions than answers.  In fact - there were no answers - just questions.

If this were science - was this a case of parallel evolution - or - given the existence of an infinite number of ""multi-verses"" - a parallel universe?

If this were science fiction - was this a case of human origins being the Cylons - in which case - evolution has come full circle?

If this were religion - with a Divine Intelligence - micromanaging each and every nano-second - of - who lived - and - who died - - - was this a case of and ""endless loop"" of births and rebirths - for - creatures totally devoid of any free will?

Were ""futuristic visions"" a case of an individual reliving the past - or - Intelligent Design - or - some sort of programming - genetic or otherwise?

All said - this was a most disappointing fourth season - better left unmade.

As a footnote: The beauty of Babylon 5 was: One writer - One vision - One thread - and - most importantly - no Gordian Knot left unraveled!",1248739200,8,1800,4.2128279883381925

3646368,2,B001HZXYDC,"I loved every season of BSG.  This show was the best show I have ever seen on TV.  Sadly, there's just not way around the fact that the final episodes of the series are a total cop out.  The writers decided to cram all the characters and plot lines into a contrived and ridiculous finale.  This forced characters to do things that were inconsistent with their development.  The only way you could accept the finale is if you suddenly stopped caring about logic, science, the mythology of the show, and all the unresolved plot lines.  I think the writers were hoping that the final revelations and the epic battle would be enough to distract viewers from the fact that they DID NOT DO THEIR HOMEWORK and THEY WROTE THEMSELVES INTO A CORNER.

That being said, there are still some absolutely stellar episodes in 4.5 including ""Sometimes a Great Notion,"" ""Blood on the Scales,"" and especially ""Someone to Watch Over Me"".

I'm trying hard not to let the terribleness of the finale ruin the rest of the show for me.  However, I recently finished re-watching Season 1 and it was hard for me to be excited by the sense of wonder and mystery the show used to invoke knowing now that most of the mysteries were meaningless or would go unanswered.  For example, the opera house is revealed at the end of Season 1 and then expanded upon and revisited throughout the rest of the series.  But in the finale, what did it really have to do with anything?  It hardly had the epic impact it needed to have in order to justify years of build up.  Perhaps that was precisely the problem the writers had.  They loved the concept of the opera house but never bothered to decide what it actually meant!

Also, I hated many other dead end plot lines in 4.5 such as the chief's baby actually belonging to Hot Dog and Six losing Tigh's baby.  Just sloppy, sloppy writing!  I can't believe the same writers, show runners, and producers put together this crap after making so many brilliant episodes.  I have never been so let down by a story I was so earnestly engaged in.  Whether it be a book, TV show, or movie.  Shame on you, writers, and especially Ronald Moore for failing to provide an ending worthy of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica.",1247529600,25,2221,4.5465994962216625
3646369,4,B001HZXYDC,My favorite TV drama. The best thing was how much I cared for even the occasional characters... and there were many. They kept me guessing and I was usually wrong... and in a good way. They could have wrapped up a couple of characters a little better in the last hour but that is a small flaw in a remarkable series.  I love it.,1247270400,6,328,4.125
3646370,5,B001HZXYDC,"Before delving into the review itself, I simply must respond to all of those naysayers decrying the finale. I shall posit a simple question for you all: what were you expecting? From reading so many of the negative reviews, if I didn't know any better, I'd think the writers chose not to answer any of our questions. But they did, I tell you!

Those expecting clear-cut, black-and-white definitive answers to EVERYTHING are simply insane. First off, no finale of ANY show has EVER answered ALL of our questions. That would be bad storytelling. Writers always answer upwards of 80% of the questions but then leave some things hanging so the viewer's imagination can fill in the gaps. Looking at how badly George Lucas dropped the ball with those prequels, why does anyone want a writer to give ALL of the answers (Midichlorians, anyone)? How scary was the Alien in ""Aliens"" after we saw it fully half a dozen times? Get the point?

This show was always about making the viewers USE their brains, rather than spelling everything out for them like an episode of Stargate. At its core, Galactica was always about relativism. While I dislike relativism in the real world, in fiction -- particularly science fiction -- it can prove to be a wonderful tool. In Galactica, like some of the great ancient Greek plays, there was no black-and-white; only shades of gray. Thus, it makes sense that they wouldn't answer everything.

They answered the big questions though. Like, who were the Final Five? What became of the 13th Tribe? Will the Fleet ever make it to Earth? What will become of our beloved characters (human and Cylon alike)? What is the significance of Hera? And, who is Baltar and Caprica Six really having visions of? Oh, and to all of those who are angered with Starbuck's story, they answered that as well! Look back to Razor. In Razor, the old Hybrid at the end proclaims that Kara Thrace is the ""herald of the apocalypse, the harbinger of doom."" However, he then goes on to explain that the Apocalypse will not be an ""end, but a beginning!"" Kara Thrace WAS an angel and she DID bring about the Apocalypse. However, the term ""apocalypse"" (like everything in Galactica) was a relative one. What may sound like doom-and-gloom destruction to us was, in fact described as a new beginning! That's exactly what happened to the humans and Cylons. They got a new beginning on a new Earth! When Starbuck's job was done, she went back to Heaven or whatever the writers wish to call the afterlife!

My only problem with the finale was the notion that the same humans that rebelled over lack of coffee grains back in season two were suddenly okay with blasting away ALL forms of technology. That was the one weak spot in the finale. But it was so minor as to not even be noticed. From beginning, middle, and end this finale closed this epic beautifully. The Battle for the Cylon Colony alone rivaled anything seen in the last three Star Wars films, in my opinion. What more could anyone want?

As for the entire Season 4.5, it was incredible. Its somber opening on the original, nuked out Earth was pitch-perfect. I especially loved how it sent the Fleet into literally a death spiral which climaxed in the great two-parter ""The Oath"" and ""Blood on the Scales"" which saw one of my favorite characters, Tom Zarek, take center stage doing what he does best with an unlikely ally on Galactica. For me, those two episodes harked back to Galactica's glory days (Season 2). They even brought back some of my favorite twisted characters from Pegasus. Then we moved into quite possibly the most interesting story of the entire series: ""No Exit."" The tragedy of John Cavil, the first Humano-Cylon model (played by the brilliantly talented Dean Stockwell). For a show that prized relativism above all else, he was the closest thing that we came to a clear-cut villain and boy, was he deliciously villainous...even possessing a bit of an Oedipus Complex which completed the picture quite nicely! Then there was the pensive ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" which allowed viewers to see Starbuck's father, Dreillide Thrace play a duet of one of the greatest renditions (on the piano no less) of ""All Along the Watchtower."" This episode is very pivotal because it sets up the emotional plot for why Galactica attacks the Cylon Colony in the aforementioned finale. This episode was also incredible due to the fact that it brought back a great relationship from Season One and then, in typical Galactica fashion, brutally turned it on its head! The episode directly before the finale ""Islanded in a Stream of Stars"" is believed to be a ""filler"" episode, but it's not! It sets up the personal emotional arc that Adama is going through. It puts him in the mindset necessary to sending Galactica out with a bang, not a whimper in the finale. It was awesome.

So, as you can see, I believe the negative statements regarding the finale are utterly baseless and unfounded. It was a grand finale for the Grandest show of all time indeed! While I am certainly biased, I like to think that I have a pretty good sense of good entertainment from bad and I tell you, anyone who purchases this season will not be disappointed. Galactica came on the scene with a big bang and left in an even grander way. In my opinion, this franchise has reached the point of rivaling both Star Wars and Star Trek, the preeminent science fiction franchises of our day. As well, you should check out the prequel spinoff, Caprica as it was simply incredible and I am greatly looking forward to that and the eventual prequel about young Adama in the First Cylon War!

Seriously speaking, Ron Moore has presented us, finally, with a great and decent ending that the truly BSG admirers were waiting since the first series. ""So say we all""",1246924800,5,395,4.739130434782608
3646372,5,B001HZXYDC,"Overall I feel that Battlestar Galactica is one of the greatest television shows created so far, with a depth and scope unmatched by the vast majority of science-fiction and drama. I will echo at least one other reviewer by saying that the show in its entirety gets 5 stars from me!

These last episodes of this groundbreaking series were quite controversial. Many people wanted the answers to the series' many questions spread out throughout the final episodes...or perhaps even given upfront. However, Season 4.5 presents a single, large story arc that introduces new plots and new questions as often as answering or concluding old ones. At times it could be frustrating to have entire episodes dedicated to the emotional development of a handful of characters rather than a focus on the big questions...however, in these final episodes, the characters really do become most prominent, and in that sense these episodes are extremely satisfying.

Perhaps the most controversial element of this set is the finale. As a conclusion for the characters that have developed throughout the series, it is brilliant. Some might argue the truth of that in one or two cases but this finale seems to have been made to stir up debate. I did feel that the finale was weak on some crucial plot points, which others will certainly mention. It is my hope that the extended version of the finale (and other episodes) on the DVD (at least I think it's there) will plug some of the holes. And as for the very last scene...I don't know...many people say that it, and much of the finale, constitutes a cop-out and a departure from the risks that the BSG team have taken time and again in their storytelling...but I would argue that their approach was fairly out of the blue...and while I found it enjoyable I'm still not sure, months later, if I like it!

Aside from the finale and the episodes overall, 4.5 had, in my opinion, some of the best single scenes in the entire show, pieces that were just stunning on so many levels (the acting, the directing, the music, and more). And, speaking of music, 4.5 continues Bear McCreary's tradition of delivering incredible and unique music that just seems to get better with each season!

So overall I'd rate this at about a 4.5 for appearing to drop the ball slightly on some crucial plot points but overall continuing the brilliant storytelling that has characterized this excellent series from the beginning. (and since there is no 4.5 I'll just round up...)",1246492800,5,2484,4.823943661971831
3646373,4,B001HZXYDC,"I didn't start watching Battlestar Galactica until the entire series was finished.  My wife and I slammed through every episode in the course of a couple of weeks.  She's not usually a fan of science fiction, and I tend not to like science fiction television, but I had too many people tell me it was worth a look so we took the plunge and it was a lot of fun.

In spite of a few hokey elements (ordinary telephones in space, Capricans eating sushi, etc.) the entire series kept me involved and excited.  It has drama, intrigue, excitement, thought-provoking ideas.  Everything you could want from science fiction.  Of course, if you're reading this review you're probably already hooked and don't need to be told all that.  Still, I think that some of the best moments of the series are in these final episodes. Most all of the questions about cylons and humans that really needed answering are answered, but in ways that put an intriguing spin on what we knew. Unlike a few gripers out there, I thought the ending was perfect, very much in keeping with the tone of the series as a whole but still novel and poignant.",1246147200,5,1118,4.56

This final season is a mixture of the excellent and the corny (details would amount to spoilers, so I'll say no more than that), and this especially is true of the double episode, which also features a rather nice twist. In addition, given that the Earth seekers all had European-type names assured that the search for Earth could have only ended in one of two ways, it was nice to get both.

I could have wished for a better ending, and a better resolution (and in some cases any resolution at all) of some of the outstanding questions, but overall the standard was high, and, I thought, always entertaining.

I did not think it was the easy way out, if anything, mixing realistic science fiction with mystical aspects was harder than to not add the mystical aspects.  I enjoyed how everything came together.

3646378,2,B001HZXYDC,"Most great stories have an ending that is conceptualized in the beginning, like Babylon 5. This makes it easy to create and complete story arcs seamlessly. With BG, an incredible ground breaking epic with powerful storylines, well developed characters, and a ongoing working of the lore, it seems like they wrote the final episodes on the fly. We were led to believe that all the pieces would eloquently come together to offer a profound, satisfying ending to the mysteries built up during the show. Well, this great show did not do this IMO. For example (caution, spoilers ahead), Starbuck was the harbinger of dome right? We heard this several times over several seasons but this went absolutely nowhere in the end. As a matter of fact, they wrote her off as an angel that did not know she was angel, just born again with no coherent explanation except perhaps the will of God. The intriguing `opera house' buildup (visions) was nothing more than people loosing a little girl from negligence and finding her. The goodbye from Adama to his son was pathetically too short. The complete abandonment of technology with barely a second thought was just absurd. It is one thing to go back to basics but to get rid of everything!!! You would think the groups would set up a way to communicate or meet periodically to learn from each other or help each other --- wasn't the idea to save humanity. If they put the time in to write the script/story such that during moving down to the planet there was a final battle with the centurions which destroys everything, then that would make sense. But No. Instead they just let the Cylon Centurions go! ""They earned it"" You would think that after all that we could expect an ending where they in some way insure the Cylons have no idea where humanity ends up to create a clean ending, and also keep the concept of `all this happened before and can happen again.'. BTW, how about the notions that it was the Centurions who supposedly came up with the idea of a single God. Also, the final five, which I guess where the original five, were nothing more than what they were in the beginning, except that they had a life before and didn't know it.

The end of probably the best series in Science Fiction is just an insult to those of us that followed and loved the show. It is as if the writers of the first 3  seasons were replaced by those that barely knew the show and had to quickly come up with a way to tie a few things together. We expected, and deserved, more, much more. Shame on them!!!",1245110400,22,2528,4.5174672489082965

Unfortunately, I'm one of those people who just can't get past the glaring faults of the series finale. While I would give most of this set a full 5 stars, I would have to give the series finale itself only 1 star.

A lot of the specific points that I had problems with have already been discussed here quite a bit, so I won't go into it too much. I hate to say it, but it really was just bad planning and laziness that culminated in this finale littered with inconsistencies. I only found one storyline to be satisfying in any way (Roslin's), while all the others I found myself in disbelief. Really, the writers and producers could have done better - We've seen them do some amazing things in previous seasons.

I would just like to take a minute to say what I DID like about the second half of season 4. I thought, excluding the finale, it was much better than the first half of the season. And one thing I haven't seen mentioned too much in its favor, is the mutiny story arc - which in my opinion is one of the best of the series. 'The Oath' and 'Blood on the Scales' were truly brilliant episodes in my opinion, some of the best of the entire series. Gaeta had some great character development in such a short period of time.
Also, I thought 'Sometimes a Great Notion' and 'Someone to Watch Over Me' were also fantastic episodes. In my opinion, this set is worth buying just for those 4 episodes, because they are just that amazing. It's just a shame that it had to be ruined by the finale.

This internal war took a turn for the worse towards the end.  There were still some good scenes, but overall I found that I wasn't enjoying the show anymore because literally every character had been undermined and there was nobody left that I really liked.

Chief?  Beats his wife.  Turns out to be a cylon.  Grows cold hearted.
Admiral?  Goes from stoic veteran to puking, suicidal crybaby.
Dualla?  Well, you know.  What was THAT all about?
Gaeta?  Yikes.  Can't undermine a character much more than that!
Anders?  Sigh.
Kara?  ?!?!
I could go on.

Point is, they destroyed, in one way or another, literally every character in the show.  Apparently ""keepin' it real, ya'll"" is more important than telling a good, compelling story with likable, strong characters.  Okay, fine, so humanity is on the ropes, doom and gloom, etc.  I'm not saying it should have been a cast of stoic, flag waving heroes but geez, you could have left us ONE.  How many breakdowns does Admiral Adama GET TO HAVE?

And then there was still a lot of unexplained weirdness.  Stuff it seems like they forgot about, or ditched, or maybe they just fired the one writer who actually had a plan for all this stuff, I dunno.  Oh, and WHY ARE WE DOING CHARACTER DEVELOPING FLASHBACKS IN THE FINAL EPISODES?!  Whose idea was that?!  Seriously, just fast forward through all the flashbacks, because they're pure filler, explain nothing and actually serves to undermine the characters that much more.  (I hope someone eventually does a BSG spoof movie, in the spirit of Meet the Spartans or Scary Movie, and part of the spoof should be that every 15 minutes, Adama walks by in the background, crying, drinking, puking, throwing paint around and asking random people to shoot him.)

I could go on, but honestly, I would have been okay with the way they ended the show had they not turned me into a disinterested party by undermining the characters.  I watched the end of this show out of a sense of investment, that I should see it through to the end, not because I was still interested in what was going on.

3646384,1,B001HZXYDC,"Anyone that followed this series from the beginning is left with a lot of unanswered questions.

The episodes form a disjointed whole, so bad in its conception that one wonders if its the Producer ( Moore ) did not do that on purpose, by leaving all questions for his next project, Caprica to answer.

Screenplay and plot are totally mediocre, no suspense anywhere, plenty of stupid ideas, crew is routinely being killed seemingly for no other reason that to get rid of them , and being badly directed the acting is lame.

The 5th Cylon, so central to the plot is finally revealed, but the person chosen is the most unlikely one, a preposterous choice that is so lame as to make you want to turn off your TV in disgust.

Here and there there are some flashes of the old BSG, moments that are painful to see as they remind you of the pedestrian plot you are watching and the missed opportunities that could have made this one of the greatest TV series ever.

Sad and pathetic, those are the two words that apply best to this entire 4th season.

By the way, did anyone notice that the 5th Cylon, so important to all, has been revealed in a bored manner ?

- Eye of Jupiter , arrow of Apollo ... what did they mean ?
- why 12 colonies ?
- why 'Earth' was destroyed ?
- if the Cylons exited back then, did we really create them ?
- are 'we' all Cylons ?
- how come Humanity worships Gods ? and ...
- why are the Cylons Monotheists ?
- did Humanity really create the Cylons ?
- why the parallels to our society ?
- Origin of the Cylons ?
- why Hera is so important ?
- why did the 4 Hidden Cylons suddenly appear ?
- what happened to D'Anna Biers (she vanishes mid season ...)

... nothing will be answered.

3646385,5,B001HZXYDC,"Probably the greatest sendoff of the best television series ever made.  It was dead nuts perfect and equally subversive and offensive to almost every dogmatic viewpoint a person can hold.

In the end, I think if there is one glaring message in BSG it's that ""people make mistakes"" - no one has all the answers and usually the most grief is caused when you hold on to your prejudices and hatred and are inflexible with your worldview and cannot change or adapt to the circumstances around you.

In season 4.5 the enemies become friends, the friends become enemies and both those who ""do not believe"" and those who ""believe"" both have their faith's tested to the breaking point.

I love that this show isn't afraid to stick it to both religion and atheism at the same time - understand that those who are very ""sure"" of their beliefs will walk away from this grumbling but in my opinion it's one of the most beautiful metaphors for faith, war, hatred, and bigotry ever written.  It's as if Moore channeled a little bit of Tolkien and realized that it's always best to paint broader metaphors than it is to be absolutely definitive and allegorical.",1242950400,10,1145,4.648514851485149
3646386,5,B001HZXYDC,"I say epilogue, not ending for 4.5, the final episodes were a string of events that made me watch like I had not done so since Season 1 and Season 2 up to the Resurrection Ship.  Season 3 had a couple of gems starting with the first few then it kind felt like a season about consequences.  Space battles were virtually well absent for the most part.  The standoff in the mid-season was tense, but ultimately both sides back off.  D'anna gets boxed, so the identities of the five are kept, but by the finale, they are revealed, well four of them.  I read no spoilers, I don't like, and personally you take away from the experience with them.  Kara's journey began with her revelation to Lee about what happen with Zak and by her 'return' at the Ionian Nebula, she is Kara Thrace, an agent with a mission.  Adama's question about humanity's worthiness to survive is put on a hold as we saw how far some go for it and for others what they won't give up to hold onto it.  The Cylons go from the hunters, to the species that questions its direction after destroying the Colonies.  The enigma wears off, but the surprises do not end.  Of the Known 7, the only surprises were D'anna, Simon, and Cavil as for the 5, I suspected Anders and Ellen from their first appearance as Cylons, except the realization of the 12 is a lot more complicated then we knew.  The Colonials get a bit thinned out over the years, they gain a second Battlestar only to lose it to secure the Second Exodus.  However Pegasus offers the alternate twist that could have happen if not for Adama having so many others to be mindful of instead of doing what Cain did.  Naturally the series enters the gray zones, nothing is black and white, all the questions we continue to ask, are asked again and again.

The cast dragged you into their world and when it had come to its closing of an epilogue, you have seen where they were and where they have gone.  Not everyone made it, but perhaps they have broken the cycle of happen before, happen again, yet as for our world, only time will tell.  The series came to me in a questionable time in my life so far and at the same time, with the close, I feel satisfied with the final episodes.  It was never what I expected with this show from Adama's speech in the miniseries to the Anders' hybrid type monologues towards the closing.

Depending on your outlook on things you might say that this ending to the series was the next best thing since the invention of the ham and cheese sandwich. Some people will look at this and find all kinds of different meaning and like i said above some people will have found it fulfilling and think that all was answered for them while most people will not.

But looking at this from a perspective of looking at the story for what is worth, season 4.5 is full of cops out and a lame ending that has left a many with a sour taste in their mouth and wondering why they had even watched the series to begin with.

The series was lost when religious storyline undertones emerged and it carried on until the very end blurring the fact that this was a series against men and machine to begin with. The men vs machine was the basis of the show and in the end it did not even matter.

Too many plot holes were not resolved even though promised by the authors. In the very last episode we were left with many more questions as to why said set of events had happened during the show. We were just left to our own devises, trying to figure out what the heck was going on...

Imagine for one moment trying to watch an episode of House M.D wherein everything is resolved but the show cuts off and you never learn the fate of the patient at all. Would you really consider this episode good?

I for one was terribly disappointed that the authors decided to take this approach to resolve the end of this story. Most people agree that we are simply left with an unfinished piece of fiction. And this is the infuriating part because it was so good until the last few episodes.

I do not know if people will agree with me but this is how i view this.

3646388,5,B001HZXYDC,"The two best dramas on television were LOST and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  However, I would say LOST beat BSG every season by just a little.  I'm proud to say that the last ten episodes of BSG surpassed LOST in quality.  Rarely has a television show been been as consistently perfect as BSG was in the last ten episodes.

First, lets address the acting.  Edward James Olmos and Mary Macdonell deserve every award they are nominated for, they were just mindblowing.  Of course, the Emmys will once again ignore them both.  The supporting players were superb as well, especially Katte Sackhoff, Alessandro Juliani,  Michael Hogan, and Kate Vernon.

The story was quite good as well, pushing through the episodes forcefully.

But in the end, all I really cared about were the characters.  I sobbed many times in the two hour series finale, it was hard to watch at points.

Good points? Well, the Boomer/Helo/Athena triangle never disappoints. Had it not been for the clever Caprica flashbacks in the finale -- Why didn't they include more of these earlier on? It was a good idea. Too similar to ""Lost"", perhaps? -- the finale wouldn't have been nearly as good. We get to see each of the paths the major characters took to this point. I love a story that comes full circle! I award an extra star for the Caprica flashbacks, as well as the surprise reveal at the very end. I also very much liked Adama's dark turn in ""Sometimes A Great Notion"", as well as the resolution to the Tory storyline. Perhaps it's worth seeing for those alone.

...Maybe.

My reaction to the Fifth Cylon: Really? Was there some sort of groundswell amongst the fans to bring this person back? One I'm not aware of?

In the end, it was irrelevant who the Final Five were. And really, who cares? The humanoid Cylons got less and less compelling as they assumed more and more human characteristics. And by the end, there were literally no distinctions left. I have a theory that as soon as the characters in a show start inter-breeding or having long-lost 'family' connections with each other, it's shark time. BSG fell prey to this device, if you think about it. Scenes with the Final Five have a soapy quality to them, which makes these people even less compelling. Ironically, Anders is the most interesting one despite lying on a gurney most the time.

The final showdown with all 12 Cylons was pretty odd. What has Cavil been after this entire time? Why is he unable to just replicate the Resurrection machines he's been using all series long? He had plenty of chances. And that's not the only plot hole: There's really only 7 models of Cylon. The other five were erased from the Cylons' memories, and they were never related to them in the first place. So how did Six know there were a total of twelve in the very beginning?

Baltar was his usual schizoid self, with a half-baked redemption at the end. I've enjoyed his Christ-like trials in these last episodes, but I can see how it would come off as contrived. Tigh was shackled by his new role and identity; it's hard to believe this is the same Tigh. Tyrol, too, was far too eager to ditch Galactica and the fleet. Kara is discarded away with a weird degree of casualness. And don't get me started on the Virtual Six. Her past actions over the course of the series don't gel with her stated aim.

There was no cohesion with past identities of these characters. They were forced into roles which changed their personalities, and it wasn't plausible.",1241481600,20,2697,4.594594594594595
3646391,3,B001HZXYDC,"I liked this series.  But, let's be honest, it started off amazing and gradually got worse from there.  Both earths (the cylon one and the one at the end) were disappointing and seemed disjointed compared to the rest.  Even the final five did not match the grandiose first depiction in the temple.  I strongly doubt an entire population would suddenly agree to get rid of all of the technology they have used their entire lives just as they faced a new and potentially dangerous environment.  Even if they would do it for themselves, they wouldn't do it if they had kids.  How about the half-cylon DNA?  One minute, it's life saving, the next minute, it turns out that we all have some.

At first, I found myself hoping the robots would kill all of them, but then I realized that would actually require some twist of the plot, so I simply looked forward to the next advertising break... even the ShamWow guy is less annoying than Admiral Dork-ama or the cancerous wheezing madam President.  This is simply a poorly done soap opera that could just as easily happen on an island in the past, nothing more than a psuedo morality play about two waring groups--assuming they could fix the lighting, increase the pacing, and use less disgusting characters.

So seeing what I suspected she might just be: a soul with a mission who couldn't let go till it was complete, right after hearing her husband, the Galactica hybrid say, ""Seeyouontheotherisde,"" I knew something big was up and she wasn't going to be around for the end somehow.

She wasn't the harbinger of Death, she was only supposed to get them there. The rest was up to everyone else.

Cylons marching in Galactica's hanger deck. That did it. I've never seen that happen in science fiction before.

This is as good, or better than DS9. Ron Moore did it.

I loved the entire series and almost every episode was a shocker that tripped me out. I really did. The music was original, the story was basially never done this way before, and every episode advanced the plot every week. No rehashes. Logically, from day one to the end.

The characters were not like their 70's counteparts, which were typical 70's cookie-cutter sterotypes of people, even the skinjob Cylons were people with their own problems, not just enemies. Some lived with and were loved by humans.

Joining together with humanity to survive saved them as well. Amazing.

Head Six and Head Baltar were some sort of angels for a God who didn't like being called that, and ""All Along the Watchtower"" played, ending the greatest TV series I've ever seen.

Colonel Tigh was Colonel Tigh, through and through even though he knew himself to actally be a Cylon. He really was an officer in the Colonial Fleet. He was always true to himself, just like Tyrol and Sam, but Tory finding out she was a Cylon simply made her evil, I think.

3646394,2,B001HZXYDC,"I had to put my 2 cents in after reading all of the over the top praise for the second half of season 4. Not sure what show these people were watching, but at least half of these episodes were pure filler and build up to a big conclusion that, frankly, did not happen. The ""answers"" to some of the big plot points were lazy and uninspired. The writers obviously had no clue how to live up to the questions they had introduced, so they mostly just flat out ignored them.

SPOILERS AHEAD. I am okay with some ambiguity about things like the inconsistently used in-heads, but after the huge mysterious build up over more than a season about Kara, what they did was inexcusable and LAZY. She just disappears?? Ridiculous. They didn't know how to get out of the corner they had written her into. So she just vanished and it was up to us to ""interpret""? That is total, lazy BS. They should have left her dead and had her be an in head. But they obviously did not think it through and had no plan when they brought her back. Her character was completely shortchanged, as was the audience. If they couldn't tell us what she was, at least they could have told us WHY she came back. And what was up with the brand new ship? Or her drawings as a child? Or the music (All Along the Watchtower is a divine song floating around the galaxy 150,000 years before it was written??) If you look back on her actions over season 4, they don't add up or make sense. If she was a divine being or sent by one, they sure didn't give her much of a purpose. Except for a dead end dramatic cheat.

And the fates of the main characters? Scattered around the planet, mostly alone? Adama abandons his son and friends to live alone? Absurd! The ENTIRE fleet UNANIMOUSLY decided to give up technology, send the fleet into the sun and live like nomads? Are you kidding me? Just stupid. The cylons? What happened to them? Cavill agress to a truce (suddenly) then even more suddenly freaks out, then shoots himself. Stupid. Just stupid. The final five? Once revealed, they did nothing. We got to see Ellen act soap opera jealous for a full episode. What a waste of screen time. The opera house vision? The prophecies? All that time spent building them up, with no payoff at all. And the hit you over the head flash to modern times with the in heads contemplating  ""all this has happened before and will happen again"" (which btw, Ron Moore got from watching Disney's Peter Pan and decided to steal for BSG, with no idea how he would use it. He stole the ""you are the harbinger of death"" line from Planet of the Apes for crying out loud! And the BSG theme of cylons rebelling against humans in a cycle is a lot like apes rebelling against humans in a cycle). Lame, lame, lame. Just awful.

The only satisfactory ending was for Roslin, and that is mostly because of good acting from her and Olmos and the fact that she had to die, so we knew what to expect and the writers didn't have to try to be creative.

I think once even hard core fans come down from the end of the show, they will re-evaluate the end of the series and be very disappointed. It was bad, sloppy writing, and kind of a middle finger to the devoted fans. The series had some really great moments, but also a lot of trite filler and misdirection. I had hoped things would pull together beautifully. But they didn't, not by a longshot.

This would have bee a 3 star review, but it is reduced to two stars because of the greed at releasing 2 sets for the season, and not at a reduced price. $100 MSRP to get 20 good to mediocre to terrible episodes? Don't think so. I own seasons 1-3, but I will probably sell them, and I won't be buying season 4 or ""4.5"".",1240876800,63,3684,4.301152737752162
3646395,4,B001HZXYDC,"Spoilers abound , and though I did not give too much away, if one has not seen the conclusion, this commentary should be passed on.  The fourth season now ends with most of the loose ends tied up and  few unanswered questions, but the ambiguity of the program and its moral relevance or irrelevance with references to religion and prejudices will fodder many a conversation around the water cooler for months / years to come.  If one has the first 3 seasons, it certainly follows that this is a MUST own,  it tidy's things up and brings a definite end and does so in a continuous way.  I have not gotten the DVD set yet, so I cannot comment on its quality (horrors if it is double-sided DVD's) but reserve comments for the show itself plus ancillary remarks.  I'll not give too much away, but once released, it's nice to watch a year's worth of episodes in a few days without commercial interruption.  However, I must admit some interruptions make for a pregnant pause indeed, creating a much more poignant scene because of the wait.

Plot holes are galore, but manageable and do not detract, in my opinion from the overall quality of the series.  For example, when the crewmember had the gun trained on the Cylon leader (under truce), why did no one attempt to disarm this person?  There were at least 6 armed humans there in escort, plenty of time to just say NO and in many ways that scene seemed entirely absurd.  Another regarded one of the Final 5 Cylons that was to be airlocked by the humans unless handed over to the Cylons.  These Cylons revered the Final 5 and wanted them so they could "" be protected and cared for"".  But this Final 5 was troubled with  the Cylonic method of persuasion.  Why did the Humans not simply put this Final 5 Cylon on the Comm with the Cylons?!?  This final 5 would have given the Cylon leader such a blistering of earful language, paint would have peeled from the bulkheads.  Maybe cliffhanger action is far more exciting to a viewing audience than salty talk and so that's what happened.

On the other hand, the reintroduction of a once demised character was extremely well done and added much intrigue and interest to the overall plot.  The complexities of developing Cylon relationships amongst themselves mirrored some of the problems the Humans were having.  One of the Final 5 completely identified with the Cylons and even their ways whereas one of the others was in rejection of it.  The contrast here was interesting to follow.

Galactica the Reimagining RMG is now done and over with though there may be other spinoff shows to follow (yes I'll probably get them all at this point).

I first became enamored with Galactica the Original Series TOS back in 1979 when I first learned of it in a New York Creative convention.  There was some initial controversy I heard about regarding  some people who wanted to pursue legal action  against them.  One was rumored to be  Lucas Studios because the Cylon Centurions looked too similar to their Star War stormtroopers.  Once the show was underway, however, I think these concerns may have died away as I did not hear anymore about it.  With the exception of their initial appearance, the Cylons, of course, were quite dissimilar to the stormtroopers.

Every Sunday night it became a ritual to watch  the Galactica and its escorted fleet trying to escape the merciless Cylons.  Occasional forays into ""camp"" and stupidity did not mar the program.  The seriousness and  respect  Lorne Greene of Bonanza fame brought to the show cannot be underestimated.  But, an enemy worse than Cylons halted the flight of humans to the mythical earth--Network economics.  From what I read in a magazine, it cost a million to make Galactica (a huge amount per episode compared to other shows).  And so the show was moved around in different  time slots until it was cancelled.  Galactica 1980 appeared a short time later and got the fleet to Earth.  Since the sets weren't as snazzy it certainly must have been less to produce.  But it disappeared from the airwaves as well leaving much entirely unresolved.

It was my understanding that Galactica TOS introduced the Cylons as a robotic race that were once organics, but incorporated so much machinery into themselves, they became an immense amount of hardware built around an organic core.  Later I came to learn that a long dead reptilian race created the AI  robots, but the AI's  revolted, wiped out their original creators and were now bent on placing their version of order on the galaxy, which included exterminating the imperfect humans.

Galactica RMG just decided to make this problem one that originated with the humans, rather than someone else's Frankenstein's Monster experiment gone array.  Thus the now Humans created the Cybernetic Living Organism Node or  Cylon.

This may have been the result of Terminator movies, Blade Runner, Star Trek the Next Generation and its offspring, Space above and Beyond, one cannot say for sure.  Even now in the real world there is the ongoing quest for the creation of a non cheating AI to just play a computer game (among other things).  In literature and film, Man  creates in his own image and soon his creation now demands rights and respect.

Galactica RMG takes this further in rather a surprise twist that I have not thought about before (maybe one of the Treks had it). Man creates AI.  AI revolts or otherwise departs from its creators.  It itself evolves and creates its OWN ai subclass.  THAT subclass revolts with nuclear war and its messiness.  Or maybe these ancient Cylons just has a serious disagreement amongst themselves which had nothing to do with a sub AI class and just went atomic on each other.  It's  a revelation to the show's current Cylons that this could happen to them as well.  Humans are not the root of all evil for Cylons are quite capable of creating their own.

In any case, I thought Galactica RMG played well into the current questions that humanity may have to answer for itself about the extent AI and robotics will take in future endeavors and conflicts.  Pilotless planes are already involved in combat operations.  It is not a stretch to expect some ground vehicles to follow and I suspect the first robotic infantrymen will be remote controlled as well.  It will be a long time before anything developed can actually become self aware and suddenly concerned about its own welfare and status quo.  But, one ever knows what breakthroughs may occur.  The first really sentient AI will probably be in an immobile box and it might be quite awhile before it is allowed to manipulate anything in the physical world.  But this need not be a handicap for that AI; as the AI development occurs, so would parallel work on complex virtual environments (as what occur in online games for example) and would be a schoolroom and playground for the fledgling AI to develop in.

One science fiction show (Space Above and Beyond) explored what happened during an AI revolt.  Mankind went on to develop cloning and grew people in wet-tanks to fight the AI's and then later be employed in dirty and dangerous jobs no one else wanted.  This opened up the same can of worms as they earlier had with the AI's.  The cloned people or ""tanks"" (they were grown in a literal tank), wanted rights and respect and the show always had  tension between the clones and those who came out of the womb.  Unfortunately, this show did not survive and explore as many issues as Galactica RMG did, but I consider it an important forerunner of serious, ambiguous, thought provoking science fiction.

This is not to say Star Trek and its derivatives did not have its serious moments, they got the train moving for science fiction beyond the Lost in Space and Steve Zodiac stuff.  Battlestar RMG, in my view approached tough problems with no easy answers; some by leaving them unresolved and moving onto something else.  Life is like that too.",1240704000,4,7923,4.735380116959064

3646397,5,B001HZXYDC,"Warning! Spoiler alert! The following review contains very signficant spoilers, including several regarding the final episode of the series. If you wish to remain spoiler free, do NOT read the following review.

In the words of the immortal Butthead, forewarned is . . . uh . . . something.

I am astonished that the finale of BSG is proving to be controversial. I watched the final episode with a sense of excitement, delight, and deep gratitude. I found it moving and appropriate to the series as a whole. I would rank it with the best series finales that I have ever seen, alongside BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and SIX FEET UNDER. In particular I found the final 20 or so minutes to be especially gratifying, as we see the final 38,000 some odd survivors of the long journey from the 12 Colonies to New Earth finally find their new home. Did everything end precisely as I wanted? Of course not. But what is important is that it ended the way that Ron Moore clearly intended it to end. I had long suspected that one of the first things that had been conceived was the role of Hera (or someone like Hera) in the overall scheme of things. That she would indeed prove to be ""The Shape of Things to Come"" was something of which I was confident, and I found the role ascribed to her -- essentially the DNA mother of our own humanity -- as both powerful and fulfilling of the great importance assigned to her. [And Ron Moore's brief cameo as the gent reading the magazine about what is obviously Hera's remains was similar to J. Michael Straczynski's cameo at the end of BABYLON 5.]

The 2008-2009 television season has seen the ending of a string of truly great series. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, THE SHIELD, and THE WIRE managed to end on their own terms, with their overall arcs ended on their own schedule. Other equally great series like PUSHING DAISIES were stopped in mid-stride. That a show as great as PUSHING DAISIES could be cancelled makes me all the more grateful that some shows like BSG manage to make it all the way to the end. My own television viewing will now be greatly diminished by the end of BSG. No show of the past five years has so consistently obsessed me. It wasn't always as consistent as I would have liked. FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is a far steadier, more consistently brilliant show, but while it has never had anywhere near as many as weak episodes as BSG, neither has it ever reached BSG's best moments. Never, ever have I had a series (with the exception of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER) at its best so completely shock and amaze me. No other show (except BUFFY) has managed to astonish me so frequently. And it did this by almost never recycling stories seen on other series. BSG not only never recycled stories from other shows, but never recycled its own stories. Any stunning plot twist, once used, was never used again.

Rarely do series redefine their genre, but BSG has done more to alter what one can do on a television Sci-fi series than any since STAR TREK first debuted in the late sixties. No future serious series in the genre can ignore the achievements of BSG. They might decide not to take up the challenge that BSG has laid down, but even that is a way of acknowledging the new standards it has laid down. Series like STARGATE SG-1 now seem oddly simplistic in comparison. Ron Moore stated in his initial mission statement that his goal was to completely redefine TV Sci-fi and in this he was supremely successful. It is impossible to overstate the importance of BSG in taking TV Sci-fi to the next level. Many have noted that it was the first important Sci-fi series that was made for adults rather than teens, but it is also the first that was directed to thinking adults instead of only Sci-fi geeks. BSG expanded the audience of those interested in Sci-fi, with thousands of people who had previously been determined not to watch any show in the genre obsessed with the fate of those on Galactica. And it has also been a huge hit with academics and intellectuals. The only television series that has received as much attention from academics has been BUFFY, and the only show to attract as much attention from nonacademic intellectuals has been BUFFY and THE SOPRANOS. Who would have thought a show based on the passionately maligned 1978 series (a show that has a small but dedicated cadre of fans, but which is otherwise attacked by TV critics and serious Sci-fi fans and writers as one of the worst series in TV history) could have ascended to such heights?

I have started rewatching the series from the very beginning in light of the series finale and I am amazed at how good it all feels knowing how it will end. The series finale of BSG fit the rest of the series so perfectly that it managed retroactively to make the rest even better. I frankly have long suspected that Ron Moore is a big, fat liar. He has often stated things that were not true or at least were only partially true. I think he had a great deal of the overall story planned from near the beginning. I believe he had many of the main arc details in mind from the beginning. I do think that he left a lot of room for alternation and development, but I believe he knew from the time of the miniseries that he intended to have the remnants of the human race align with the Cylons to become the genetic ancestors of our own human race. One of the first moments in BSG of note was when Caprica Six looked at an infant with amazement, shortly before she broke its neck (an act that is one of the most effective mission statements I've ever seen -- after that, you knew the show was capable of anything). And the crucial moment came when President Laura Roslin stressed to Commander Adama that it was crucial that they leave that part of the galaxy to find a new home where the survivors could ""start having babies."" Early in the first episode of Season One Head Six asks Gaius Baltar if he would like to have a child. We then soon learn of the mission of the other Sharon on Caprica to try and make Helo fall in love with her and get her pregnant. In retrospect, we see that ""The Plan"" was to perpetuate the Cylon race by biological reproduction.

Similarly, from early on the show was concerned with ever deepening religious themes, as God (though Head Baltar in the finale tells Head Six that he doesn't care for that name) directed the fate of both Cylons and humans to their eventual fate. Even Starbuck is shown to be an instrument of God, as she is sent back to the fleet after her death in order to help them find their way to their new home. Until the finale we had no idea precisely how deep this idea that God had a plan for them truly was, but as the series comes to an end we realize that Head Six's words to Baltar in the first regular season episode were absolutely true: this all was God's plan. To what degree this God coincides with a Christian or Muslim or Jewish god is very much open to debate, but that it unceasingly is at the core of BSG cannot now be questioned.

BSG begins with the question -- put forward by Bill Adama as he participates in Galactica's decommissioning ceremony -- whether humanity had a right to survive. The answer to this is delayed for the length of the series, as we see the fleet undergo a series of trials. The parallels with the account in Exodus of the Children of Israel departing from Egypt to the Promised Land increase as the series nears its end. Just as the Children of Israel undergo a series of temptations, so do the members of the fate. Likewise, the fleet's Moses, Laura Roslin, is allowed to see the promised land but not enter (she dies as Adama finds the spot upon which to build the cabin she longed for). That humanity has earned the right to survive comes as the crew of Galactica undertakes the ship's final mission, the rescue of the Human-Cylon hybrid child Hera, whose DNA becomes the foundation of a new humanity.

So, the show's many rich and deep themes are successfully and beautifully resolved at the end. Those who found the ending unsatisfying seem not to recognize this. But I'm baffled. What more can one ask of a series than to resolve successfully all its major themes?

While I loved the end of the series, I can understand some of the uneasiness some felt. In order to break the cycle (""All of this has happened before; all of this will happen again"") of death and destruction, Lee Adama persuades the survivors to embrace a nontechnological culture. I understand this on a poetic level even as I question it on a psychological level. And like many I found the departure of Starbuck, one of the great iconic characters in the history of TV (it is funny now to remember how upset some were that Starbuck was going to be played by a girl), both too sudden and less than satisfying. But this is nitpicking and should be recognized as such. To carp on something that wasn't quite done to one's satisfaction while ignoring the massive number of things that were done so exceptionally well is petty.

Sadly the end of BSG signals the disbanding of one of the most wonderful and largest casts in the history of television. Only LOST can match BSG in the size and richness of its cast of characters. I'm going to miss Adama, Laura Roslin, Lee, Kara, Sharon (in whatever form), Helo, Hera, Tigh, Tyrol, Baltar, all of the Sixes, Dee, Ellen, Duck, Kat, Billy, Tory, Anders, Racetrack, Cally, Doc Cottle, Jake, Elosha, Sgt. Mathis, Captain Kelly, Zarek, Gaeta, Seelix, Hotdog, Romo Lampkin and all the others (all the way down to the tattooed Asian guy who never had a line of dialogue and whose main function seemed to be to keep Galactica's card games going) -- not to mention the Cavils, Dorals, D'Annas, Simons, and Leobens. And I'm going to miss Galactica itself. For five years this show has been one of the great presences in my life. I won't be saying goodbye easily.

We do have the BSG prequel CAPRICA to look forward to next month (the pilot film is being released on DVD in April and will go to series in January 2010) and the film BATTLESTAR GALACTICA: THE PLAN appears in the fall. The latter will almost certainly resolve one of the final remaining mysteries of BSG: who Caprica Six saw in the miniseries and uttered the words, ""I've been expecting you."" So, while I'm heartbroken that this great series is leaving us, its departure is eased by the new series and the upcoming film. And I am intensely grateful that such a great series ended so marvelouslyl. I believe that those who are complaining about the finale are way off base and I also believe that as they rewatch the series and reassess the finale in light of that they'll recognize what a brilliant ending it was.",1240272000,18,10669,4.502839442436758

Either you weren't paying attention, or you just want make negative reviews to solidify you're own belief system(or lack there of!)...this all is coming from a headstrong atheist mind you!

Secondly, for the first 3 star reviewer...the hybrid doesn't tell Kara she will lead them to their doom, it's ""Kara Thrace, you are the harbinger of death...you will lead them to their end"" which is pretty duplicitous, both for the Cylons and humans if you really rub the brain cells together and think about it!

Overall I enjoyed the end of the show, it wasn't perfect, but when are TV finales ever perfect??? I think the idea to bear in mind was brought up during the final writing sessions for the show...""It's the characters, stupid""...obsessing and nitpicking over tiny elements is for people who seem to have missed the bigger point.

3646400,5,B001HZXYDC,"Battlestar Galactica: Season 4.5

When I was in college, the original Battlestar Galactica premiered on network television. The immediate comparison to Star Wars was inevitable.  However, at the time it was a costly weekly series to make, and it was spectacular in its effects and stories.  Those old European capes were tremendous.

Galactica: 1980 came after the original series attempting to tie up certain things; the earth was the 1980's.  Unfortunately, this one lost the essence of what made the original series. The true core was missing.

The reincarnation of Battlestar Galactica gave the current generation a humanity struggling for survival against a ruthless enemy.  Parallels to current events since 911 played throughout the series.

The last episodes showed this ruthless enemy with a human face.  Battlestar Galactica never dealt with pure black and white reality.  Like current societies, reality is always chromatic in nature.

Each week of the last season built toward the climax of a daring adventure which Daybreak adeptly brings full circle. This full circle of life and death is brilliantly displayed in the last hour.

Visions, prophecies, faith, angels, death, resurrection and other religious overtones are well crafted into each episode, especially in Daybreak.  The tension, the fear, the mutiny and the intrigue are all here.

Humanity, both sides of it as demonstrated in the human and Cylon counterparts, is displayed with clarity in this season.  Sadness is an under lying motif in these final episodes which one cannot escape.

Bravery, courage and love are dealt with beautifully.  Of courses, there are surprises and twists along this journey to the lost tribe and a new home for the remnants of humanity.

The last ten minutes is a bit controversial for some people, but for those of us who grew up watching and reading science fiction, it was a pleasant surprise, a rare treat.  It was like coming home from school to find chocolate chip cookies and cold milk waiting on the kitchen counter.  The milieu is still scented with the aroma of freshly baked cookies and just-poured milk.

So, enjoy and keep a box of Kleenex nearby for those moments which demand a human reaction.  There are a number of those.",1240185600,4,2243,5.087671232876712
3646401,5,B001HZXYDC,"Now the series is over.  I don't know for sure what I'm going to do with my Friday nights anymore; not much of a fan of ""tv series"", but I made sure to be in front of the tube every Friday night for this show.  Can I say it was perfect; no, very few things are.  However, this show came about as close to perfection as I can imagine.  Where the original series, (which I watch regularly), fell into the formulaic trap of journey, conflict, fight and escape this series managed to become original by becoming spiritual.  I've heard some say that the foray down this path began to ruin the show, however, I think that this is what made the show compelling, engrossing and engaging.  The notion that for four years we were led to believe that perhaps Baltar was a cylon or insane only to find out that he was being guided by an angel I would have never imagined.  I've read on some blogs the speculation that Starbuck was also an angel; I personally don't think so.  The Caprica and Baltar angels were self possessed, in control and seemed to know what they were and what they were doing.  Contrast that description with Starbuck; confused, obsessed with a sense of a calling, but confused as to what that calling was as well as trying to avoid having to respond to that calling.  I think I've got a better description; she was a prophet, a little bit of a cross between Moses and Jonah.  Like Moses she had a mission to lead her people, but like Jonah she didn't want to do what she was called to do; Jonah committed virtual suicide being swallowed and Starbuck did commit suicide to; both to escape what God wanted them to do.  However, in both instances God's plans aren't thwarted that easily; Starbuck found herself brought back from the dead just as Jonah was brought back from the deep to fulfill his mission.  Anyway, that's just my spin; hollywood and tv popularize the notion that angels are human souls, i.e. Clarence from Its a Wonderful Life; and this is theologically erroneous, as angels are a class of creatures unto themselves.  I thought the conclusion of this series was touching, moving and entirely satisfying.  I found the redemption of Baltar very satisfying; unlike the original series which I found his motivation always puzzling in this series he was portrayed as a flawed human who ""sinned"" by giving in to his base desires and passions, (lust/sex).  We are all susceptible to this, it's just that most of us when we stumble don't bring down mankind with us.  So, I really liked the idea that he finally committed an unselfish act, and in the end was no longer ashamed of his humble beginnings.  We should all be so fortunate to be able to make that journey while still alive.",1240099200,11,2700,4.531958762886598
3646402,5,B001HZXYDC,"What I loved about this half of Season 4 is how much of it makes total sense and how disappointed in myself that I didn't figure it out. Having recently watched the first half of Season 4, many of the ""reveals"" in the finale are already given away earlier on if only all of us are paying attention. SPOILER ALERT: Starbuck's reveal as an angel was spelled out by Leoban on the Demetrius. Why I didn't take it literally until it was screamed in my face at the very end I will never understand!

Nevertheless, the finale of the series is the high point, but it completely depends on the rest of the season to make sense. Plots progress so rapidly that missing one episode will reduce your understanding.

SPOILER ALERT: The fact that God was behind EVERYTHING in the series should have been the most obvious thing to anyone paying attention. The brilliant thing about Moore is how he mislead us into believing the series took place in the distant future, not 175,000 years in the past. It shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone (except hardened atheists - more on that later) that all the metaphysical and religious talk over the entire run of the show was going to have a major payoff in the end. It would have been the most ridiculous thing to consistently deal with all the religious views of these people only not to explain it in the end.

Still, we get to the resolution of some pretty major stuff here. The redemption of Baltar is especially sweet to watch, as he finally takes the leap of faith of making a truly selfless act. Seeing the bittersweet end of Bill and Laura's time together was probably the only thing I expected in some way. Tyrol's abandonment of humanity, and Anders achieving his place in something perfect was beautiful.

It is true that some of the very final plot points seemed out of place at first glance. For example, why would the fleet, after spending four years never agreeing on anything, finally decide to abandon technology in favor of a nomad's life. While I hope this is more roundly explained in an extended version of the finale, it does make sense in a way. We never see the civilians discuss it, but the discovery of Earth did validate Adama and Roslin and their decision to partner with the Cylons. If nothing else, it affirmed that something greater than themselves was ultimately in control. Surely word of Starbuck's miraculous coordinate entering and the other events that took place on the Galactica must have filtered down to the civilians and gave them pause in their doubt. Think of it: If an event like 9/11 can harden one's resolve in one direction, don't you think that a miraculously positive event can equally strengthen your resolve. Think too of how long these people were stuck on ships searching tirelessly for a home. None of us can imagine a life so dreary and monotonous as theirs.

I mentioned hardened atheists earlier and I have a comment for them. If you are adamant against the existence of God or anything like a God, then you will probably hate the finale. While you should have figured it out all along, the ending really puts one's ability to accept the inevitable to the test. If you are open to the possibility to God, then the finale may make you smile - or even cry as it did for me.",1240099200,5,3261,4.5580204778157
3646403,4,B001HZXYDC,"While I would give the series as a whole (and each individual season preceding this) 5 stars, I feel compelled to drop this final chapter to 4 stars. Battlestar Galactica is a brilliant, gutsy show, and the risks it took are part of the reason we fans got so intense about it over the years. It was called the most subversive show in television history by Rolling Stone magazine, and, given the plot-lines about terrorism and insurgency at the height of the Iraq War, I think that's a fair assessment. The final season (4.0 and 4.5) become more about the internal mythology of the show, and this is where a few problems sneak in. As shows like Lost demonstrate, it's easier to set up mysteries than to resolve them. Battlestar resolves many of the plot-lines brilliantly (I love the choice of the final cylon in particular; and one character's suicide is truly haunting), but others leave me wanting. Starbuck, one of the best characters in this all-around extraordinary cast, gets muddled. I'm trying to avoid spoilers, so I'll just say that the resolution of the mystery surrounding her character is not satisfactorily handled. Ron Moore's decision to leave her conclusion ambiguous is, in my opinion, a glaring error.

The series finale is naturally the focus of this set, and I must say I've had mixed feelings about it since it aired. On the one hand, it was an intense, emotional experience, never boring for a moment, and brought nearly every character and plotline to a conclusion. However, I think it may have over-reached, beating us over the head with its ""message."" Battlestar Galactica was often a reflection of ourselves and our world, but never before had it been didactic, as it is in its final scene.

With another movie on its way and a prequel series for next year, Battlestar Galactica isn't over yet, but this is the end of the story as begun in the 2003 miniseries.

3646405,1,B001HZXYDC,"What could have been a truly great show has fallen flat on its metaphorical behind not only with the final episode, but most of the 4th series.

The plot threads we all hoped would be at least partially explained have been written off as the work of God.

RDM has used ""deus ex machina"" to tie the series up. This plot device for those who don't know (or are too gullible to even care)is the ultimate sin of any writer and has to be ""the great cop out in the sky"" This is a great shame because a show of this stature deserved much, much better.

Basically this means that RDM can finish off the story in any absurd or ridiculous fashion he likes so he doesn't have to explain anything but just invokes ""God did it in his mysterious way"". I had little problem when the gods were portrayed through faith as metaphor, but the Gods are cast as real and cannot be really interpreted in any other way. I'm sorry but am not impressed by this cheap overtly manipulative approach.

Any reasonably explained scientific rationalism has been ditched completely, so those looking for any self consistent rules to be played out will be disappointed.....unless you are Ned Flanders.

One of the main themes of this show was ""are we worthy to survive?"" and this brought in many valid questions as well as answers to this in a religious context. The religious content WAS implicit from the start, but there was a better balance between gritty stark reality and religion in the first 3 seasons. The series has really gone off the rails since mid way through series 3. The last season taken as a whole had few highpoints and it wasted a lot of precious story telling time on soap opera melodramatic storylines which were never expounded consistently. ie: the final 5 cylons, who was the 5th cylon? How did Starbuck return from the dead? Why did they find her body/viper many light years from where it met its end? A lot of these elements felt like mere plot devices and didn't go anywhere. The resolution of the opera house dream was inadequately dealt with. The final 5 felt as if they just had to use actors already contracted so that they didn't have to pay the cost for new ones. They had very little input to the outcome anyway. Missed opportunities galore there.

The final episode while superficially emotionally entertaining is poorly realised and feels rushed off in a helter skelter overcompressed storyline which throws logic to the far ends of the universe or down the singularity with the rest of the cylon baddies....leaving only boloney in its wake

When the show was good it was the best there's ever been. The mini series, the episodes about the Pegasus, the New Caprica plot lines, the rise of Tom Zarek, the black market, the collaborator witch hunt, scorched Earth et al.

The cast gave exceptional performances, some of the writing was at times excellent, at times dire, the insurrection plot line worked well and the cgi was of feature film quality. Many episodes in this final set felt like mere padding. It would have been a much better ending if they had finished the series half way through when they found scorched Earth. Or just used these episodes more wisely to explore and set up a more consistent ending. It would have been BRAVER. But no the ending RDM used renders the actions of previous seasons pointless. Re watching the series may be a redundant act once you know how it ends.

I won't actually give away plot lines here as that would be unfair but prepare to be very disappointed unless you are Ned Flanders.

I know this review may upset some fans, but after checking out the BSG blog sites a lot of fans feel let down. I have been a big fan of the show and found it to be at its best when it was most pragmatic/political/sociological/psychological.

But this is my opinion which i have a right to exercise.

If this is the best RDM can do i feel inclined not to buy the final season and will probably give the forthcoming ""Caprica"" and ""The Plan"" a wide berth.

BSG will sadly be remembered as the show that started off great but had the stupid ending",1239408000,64,4073,4.547814207650274

The new BSG series is in my opinion, one of the best sci-fi shows ever to hit the screen. (Season Two was my favorite season.) I especially enjoyed the way in which BSG portrayed both humanity and the Cylons as squabbling endlessly amongst themselves to the extent that they virtually destroyed themselves without each other's help.

But the show's conclusion at the end of Season 4? I found it lame.

What was the point of repeatedly pointing out that Starbuck was the Harbinger of Destruction leading to the doom of mankind, and then having her save mankind instead?

The scene where she found her corpse and said, ""If that's Kara Thrace, then who am I?"" was very, very powerful. Watching the Cylon who had so often prophesied over her through the show then bolt in terror was priceless.

When you combine Starbuck's death with the 'Harbinger of Destruction' prophecies about her, plus the fact that the final five Cylons did not invent resurrection technology but found it already in place (orbiting the original Earth?), also that someone built a brand new Viper for the 'fake' Starbuck, - all these things pointed heavily to another insidious player behind the scenes. Let's not forget the visions of Baltar and Caprica running off with Hera.

Seemed like someone else was pulling the strings, bringing all these threads together, with the intention of humanity (as well as the remaining Cylons?) destroying themselves in a blaze of self-centered stupidity typical of the series. The logical conclusion was that
Baltar and Caprica would rescue Hera and rush off to start the cycle all over again with just the three of them, the last survivors. ""All of this has happened before, all of this will happen again.""

But to explain all of this away, in fact, ignore all of this, and turn Starbuck and the projection Baltar and Caprica into angels????!!!! With God as the mysterious player in the background???? (Let's reflect on the actions of the Caprica `angel' from the earlier seasons - she tormented, manipulated, physically attacked, even `slept' with Baltar - sound like an angel??? Sounds more like a Cylon projection of the real Caprica Six.)

And to end the show with the 'angel' versions of Baltar and Caprica 150,000 years later reflecting over how Hera became the 'ancestral Eve' of our own humanity, well, I just found it disappointing.

I wanted to see an insidious, mysterious player with his own devious intent, who was manipulating others for so long, keeping that cycle going, be revealed as everything went awry, not this sudden twist of angels etc to quickly tie things off. Even the final five cylons said they 'invented' the God that they taught to the cylons.

Just seemed to fizzle out, to me, which is a shame, because I had such high expectations.",1238457600,12,2854,4.865979381443299
3646407,5,B001HZXYDC,"After seeing the series finale, I have to say that this was some fantastic ride.  For once, the audience wasn't treated like a bunch of simple minded people.  This is a show that makes you think, feel, and react....and it did that for me in everyway.  In fact, one week after the finale, I am still extremely sad that the ride is over.  It is one of the best series I have EVER seen on TV. I've enjoyed Ron Moore's work in the past with Deep Space Nine...but he really took it up one more notch with BSG.  This writing, this acting, this kind of storytelling, I am afraid, will not be seen again like this for years. Thank you for some of the most amazing TV moments....you will not be disappointed with 4.5.

Lastly.....the music on this series is top notch outstanding....it will have you biting your nails, standing up off the couch nervous wondering what's going to happen next......and then.....it's over.  Time has no meaning with this show.  So hopefully you've seen all the episodes...if a friend hasn't, make sure you tell them to lock their doors, turn off the phones, close the windows and have a marathon....they're in for a real treat:)",1237939200,7,1149,4.570731707317073

It is not lightly that I say this, but the finale was the best final episode of any show I have ever seen! Everything was wrapped up and answered. The ending was full of action, adventure, some comedy and plenty of drama. When Laura and Bill went off in the raptor it was truyly beautiful and touching, when she died and he put his ring on her finger, well I lost it and had to pause my dvr because I was crying so hard (not an easy feat to get me to cry). After that I honestly thought that Bill was going to crash the ship because he's said before that he can't live without her, especialy after the touching goodbyes to Lee and Kara.

The scenes with the opera house and everyone chasing Hera through the ship were amazing, it worked together incredibly well. And Anders as the Galactica ""hybrid"" was truly amazing. Tyrol killing Tory was unexpected but a great shocking moment

I loved the flashback scenes. It showed what they had, what they lost, and how they changed. I loved seeing the scenes with Kara and Zack, It was nice to see that there was a time when she was actualy happy.

Six and Baltar in ""modern"" NYC was great, and the montage with the robots at the end was actualy kind of spooky.

3646409,4,B001HZXYDC,"The season finale of this show was a massive disappointment to me (I've followed it from the mini-series to finale). To examine and explore the aspects of a character is what a good writer should do, but to introduce scenarios, flashbacks, that show the character acting out of their established character does nothing but demean all that has been established. Also, in the finale, there's the ""I'm smarter than you"" scene involving Starbuck. What had been set up as ominous is revealed to be something contrary. Had it been merely context without screen effect, then Moore could have candidly said that it was a misinterpretation.  That isn't the case.
On the pro side, it has been a decently written series, a well acted series, and for the most part, the audience was able to see character growth in the show's big nine (ten counting Helo), and predictability was minimal. What I consider a poor finale won't deter me from completing my DVD set with Season 4.5 (it'll look frakkin' awesome under my autographed pic of the Season 1 cast---all the big nine). Perhaps Moore has a better entry for the season finale in the unedited version that'll be available in this set.",1237852800,3,1172,4.801980198019802
3646410,5,B001HZXYDC,"Warning!  Spoiler alert!  The following review contains very signficant spoilers, including several regarding the final episode of the series.  If you wish to remain spoiler free, do NOT read the following review.

In the words of the immortal Butthead, forewarned is . . . uh . . . something.

I am astonished that the finale of BSG is proving to be controversial.  I watched the final episode with a sense of excitement, delight, and deep gratitude.  I found it moving and appropriate to the series as a whole.  I would rank it with the best series finales that I have ever seen, alongside BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and SIX FEET UNDER.  In particular I found the final 20 or so minutes to be especially gratifying, as we see the final 38,000 some odd survivors of the long journey from the 12 Colonies to New Earth finally find their new home.  Did everything end precisely as I wanted?  Of course not.  But what is important is that it ended the way that Ron Moore clearly intended it to end.  I had long suspected that one of the first things that had been conceived was the role of Hera (or someone like Hera) in the overall scheme of things.  That she would indeed prove to be ""The Shape of Things to Come"" was something of which I was confident, and I found the role ascribed to her -- essentially the DNA mother of our own humanity -- as both powerful and fulfilling of the great importance assigned to her. [And Ron Moore's brief cameo as the gent reading the magazine about what is obviously Hera's remains was similar to J. Michael Straczynski's cameo at the end of BABYLON 5.]

The 2008-2009 television season has seen the ending of a string of truly great series.  BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, THE SHIELD, and THE WIRE managed to end on their own terms, with their overall arcs ended on their own schedule.  Other equally great series like PUSHING DAISIES were stopped in mid-stride.  That a show as great as PUSHING DAISIES could be cancelled makes me all the more grateful that some shows like BSG manage to make it all the way to the end.  My own television viewing will now be greatly diminished by the end of BSG.  No show of the past five years has so consistently obsessed me.  It wasn't always as consistent as I would have liked.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is a far steadier, more consistently brilliant show, but while it has never had anywhere near as many as weak episodes as BSG, neither has it ever reached BSG's best moments.  Never, ever have I had a series (with the exception of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER) at its best so completely shock and amaze me.  No other show (except BUFFY) has managed to astonish me so frequently.  And it did this by almost never recycling stories seen on other series.  BSG not only never recycled stories from other shows, but never recycled its own stories.  Any stunning plot twist, once used, was never used again.

Rarely do series redefine their genre, but BSG has done more to alter what one can do on a television Sci-fi series than any since STAR TREK first debuted in the late sixties.  No future serious series in the genre can ignore the achievements of BSG.  They might decide not to take up the challenge that BSG has laid down, but even that is a way of acknowledging the new standards it has laid down.  Series like STARGATE SG-1 now seem oddly simplistic in comparison.  Ron Moore stated in his initial mission statement that his goal was to completely redefine TV Sci-fi and in this he was supremely successful.  It is impossible to overstate the importance of BSG in taking TV Sci-fi to the next level.  Many have noted that it was the first important Sci-fi series that was made for adults rather than teens, but it is also the first that was directed to thinking adults instead of only Sci-fi geeks.  BSG expanded the audience of those interested in Sci-fi, with thousands of people who had previously been determined not to watch any show in the genre obsessed with the fate of those on Galactica.  And it has also been a huge hit with academics and intellectuals.  The only television series that has received as much attention from academics has been BUFFY, and the only show to attract as much attention from nonacademic intellectuals has been BUFFY and THE SOPRANOS.  Who would have thought a show based on the passionately maligned 1978 series (a show that has a small but dedicated cadre of fans, but which is otherwise attacked by TV critics and serious Sci-fi fans and writers as one of the worst series in TV history) could have ascended to such heights?

I have started rewatching the series from the very beginning in light of the series finale and I am amazed at how good it all feels knowing how it will end.  The series finale of BSG fit the rest of the series so perfectly that it managed retroactively to make the rest even better.  I frankly have long suspected that Ron Moore is a big, fat liar.  He has often stated things that were not true or at least were only partially true.  I think he had a great deal of the overall story planned from near the beginning.  I believe he had many of the main arc details in mind from the beginning.  I do think that he left a lot of room for alternation and development, but I believe he knew from the time of the miniseries that he intended to have the remnants of the human race align with the Cylons to become the genetic ancestors of our own human race.  One of the first moments in BSG of note was when Caprica Six looked at an infant with amazement, shortly before she broke its neck (an act that is one of the most effective mission statements I've ever seen -- after that, you knew the show was capable of anything).  And the crucial moment came when President Laura Roslin stressed to Commander Adama that it was crucial that they leave that part of the galaxy to find a new home where the survivors could ""start having babies.""  Early in the first episode of Season One Head Six asks Gaius Baltar if he would like to have a child.  We then soon learn of the mission of the other Sharon on Caprica to try and make Helo fall in love with her and get her pregnant.  In retrospect, we see that ""The Plan"" was to perpetuate the Cylon race by biological reproduction.

Similarly, from early on the show was concerned with ever deepening religious themes, as God (though Head Baltar in the finale tells Head Six that he doesn't care for that name) directed the fate of both Cylons and humans to their eventual fate.  Even Starbuck is shown to be an instrument of God, as she is sent back to the fleet after her death in order to help them find their way to their new home.  Until the finale we had no idea precisely how deep this idea that God had a plan for them truly was, but as the series comes to an end we realize that Head Six's words to Baltar in the first regular season episode were absolutely true:  this all was God's plan.  To what degree this God coincides with a Christian or Muslim or Jewish god is very much open to debate, but that it unceasingly is at the core of BSG cannot now be questioned.

BSG begins with the question -- put forward by Bill Adama as he participates in Galactica's decommissioning ceremony -- whether humanity had a right to survive.  The answer to this is delayed for the length of the series, as we see the fleet undergo a series of trials.  The parallels with the account in Exodus of the Children of Israel departing from Egypt to the Promised Land increase as the series nears its end.  Just as the Children of Israel undergo a series of temptations, so do the members of the fate.  Likewise, the fleet's Moses, Laura Roslin, is allowed to see the promised land but not enter (she dies as Adama finds the spot upon which to build the cabin she longed for).  That humanity has earned the right to survive comes as the crew of Galactica undertakes the ship's final mission, the rescue of the Human-Cylon hybrid child Hera, whose DNA becomes the foundation of a new humanity.

So, the show's many rich and deep themes are successfully and beautifully resolved at the end.  Those who found the ending unsatisfying seem not to recognize this.  But I'm baffled.  What more can one ask of a series than to resolve successfully all its major themes?

While I loved the end of the series, I can understand some of the uneasiness some felt.  In order to break the cycle (""All of this has happened before; all of this will happen again"") of death and destruction, Lee Adama persuades the survivors to embrace a nontechnological culture.  I understand this on a poetic level even as I question it on a psychological level.  And like many I found the departure of Starbuck, one of the great iconic characters in the history of TV (it is funny now to remember how upset some were that Starbuck was going to be played by a girl), both too sudden and less than satisfying.  But this is nitpicking and should be recognized as such.  To carp on something that wasn't quite done to one's satisfaction while ignoring the massive number of things that were done so exceptionally well is petty.

Sadly the end of BSG signals the disbanding of one of the most wonderful and largest casts in the history of television.  Only LOST can match BSG in the size and richness of its cast of characters.  I'm going to miss Adama, Laura Roslin, Lee, Kara, Sharon (in whatever form), Helo, Hera, Tigh, Tyrol, Baltar, all of the Sixes, Dee, Ellen, Duck, Kat, Billy, Tory, Anders, Racetrack, Cally, Doc Cottle, Jake, Elosha, Sgt. Mathis, Captain Kelly, Zarek, Gaeta, Seelix, Hotdog, Romo Lampkin and all the others (all the way down to the tattooed Asian guy who never had a line of dialogue and whose main function seemed to be to keep Galactica's card games going) -- not to mention the Cavils, Dorals, D'Annas, Simons, and Leobens.  And I'm going to miss Galactica itself.  For five years this show has been one of the great presences in my life.  I won't be saying goodbye easily.

We do have the BSG prequel CAPRICA to look forward to next month (the pilot film is being released on DVD in April and will go to series in January 2010) and the film BATTLESTAR GALACTICA: THE PLAN appears in the fall.  The latter will almost certainly resolve one of the final remaining mysteries of BSG:  who Caprica Six saw in the miniseries and uttered the words, ""I've been expecting you.""  So, while I'm heartbroken that this great series is leaving us, its departure is eased by the new series and the upcoming film.  And I am intensely grateful that such a great series ended so marvelouslyl.  I believe that those who are complaining about the finale are way off base and I also believe that as they rewatch the series and reassess the finale in light of that they'll recognize what a brilliant ending it was.",1237766400,281,10741,4.502839442436758
3646411,1,B001HZXYDC,"I was highly disappointed with the ending for BSG. Not to give too much away for those that didn't see it yet, but I felt the ending was cobbled together and it felt forced. There were also some secondary plots that were left unresolved and some scenes didn't make sense.

Items of concern
- The fates of Bill and Apollo Adama.
- Starbuck's ending was abrupt and unnecessary.
- The fleet's final decision was unanimous? Really? This fleet can never make a decision to do anything together for four years and then they unanimously decide to do what Bill Adama and the Cylons want to do?
- There were many more unsatisfying conclusions than I care to go into.

I'm also still unsure what all of the flashbacks were for during the last two episodes of the series. I expected they would assist in tying up the fates of their referenced characters, but they never did. It seemed they had some extra footage in the vaults that was never used a the producers decided to include it now.

Overall, an unsatisfying farewell show for me. Unfortunately, the series was a gem all the way through until the last 20-30 minutes of the series finale... during which, the writers decided to implode in spectacular fashion.

I can't put into words the depths of my disappointment with the series finale of my favorite show EVER!

I really got into Battlestar Galectica, the actors and their characters were really good. Ive been in to Science Fiction since seventh grade (a long time ago, and far, far away). This set of ten episodes, the final half of the last season, had enough plot twists to boggle the mind. By this season, almost all the characters had developed their personalities. The only thing left was to wrap up their stories, along with the series main plot conclusion. Im pausing here to let others know a few of this sets features. First: watch the extended versions  theres a better story there. Second: watch the deleted scenes  most of the deletes were small bits of dialog or actions removed from a larger scene. It was still interesting. Third: if you watch the behind the scenes features, you may detect a hint of sarcasm (make that a lot), in some of the cast and support staff. I prefer to see how certain scenes were shot, not to listen to a rant, even in jest. Back to our program. In the last 30 minutes or so of the last episode, the destiny of the characters was revealed. Ill be blunt, the Adamas did not fare well. I understand the writers objectives on both Bill and Lee, one destiny was obvious but sad, the other was a letdown, a big letdown. I do understand the why, but I didn't like it.
