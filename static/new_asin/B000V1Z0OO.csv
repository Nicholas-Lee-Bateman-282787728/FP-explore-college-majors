2928626,5,B000V1Z0OO,I bought this for my grandchildren. The man who does the talking is very easy to understand even though he has an accent. It has already been watched multiple times. If anyone is currious about how a hive works---this dvd will tell you everything you need to know. CJ,1359331200,,267,4.469387755102041
2928627,5,B000V1Z0OO,"good movie for all ages. I have two versions. The original from Denmark I believe is better. Can not seem to get original anymore. The U.S. version is ok but lacks the soul power of the older master beekeeper narrating. No dogma in movie. It is just about the bees. I say again,"" not just for kids, this is a must for anyone thinking about keeping bees.",1331337600,,353,4.2835820895522385
2928628,5,B000V1Z0OO,"We thought this video was great. The only problem I have with it is one weird part in the middle. There are two kids running through a feild and they say ""I want to fly like a bee...one two three....I want to fly like a bee."" But they say it like they are possessed. We sell honey at a locals farmers market and like to play this video so people can see in the hive. But once that weird part comes on we always turn the volume down.",1279929600,2,432,3.9204545454545454
2928629,5,B000V1Z0OO,"This film is so wonderful that I have to give it five stars. My son, who is fascinated with bees and beekeeping, was completely entranced by this film. It is an excellent introduction to bees for younger audiences.

However, I was a little disappointed that this film is only 30 minutes long. The price is WAY too steep for a 30 minute film!",1271203200,3,341,4.412698412698413
2928630,5,B000V1Z0OO,"This is a great staring point for teaching children (and adults) about the mystery of honeybees.  As a beekeeper, I've found that good quality DVDs are way more effective at teaching young people just how neat bees really around.  Well-filmed and narrated, ""City of Bees"" is the story of honeybees as viewed through the eyes of a six year old boy.  Very educational and well worth the price.",1255046400,,391,4.720588235294118
2928631,5,B000V1Z0OO,"This dvd was produced in Denmark to teach children about honeybees. Adults will also love this dvd. The narative explains what a hive is, the life of honeybees, and how bees pollinate flowers and trees.
This dvd is not only education, but, it is fun to watch.",1246665600,,259,4.531914893617022
2928632,5,B000V1Z0OO,This is alot of information for any age.  My husband & I are beekeepers and find this a very well put together.  I took it to my daughters school and all the kids loved it (from 3-8th grade).,1233100800,7,191,4.0
2928633,5,B000V1Z0OO,"This beautiful film explains the workings of a beehive throughout the year, and throughout the life cycle, in a way that children can understand. Not only that, but several (young) children narrate the film, ask questions, and are shown looking at commercial hives. This is one of the most beautifully filmed documentaries for children I have ever seen. Do not be put off by the bland cover! It is engaging and informative, while being slow-paced for children. As both charming and educational, I highly recommend this.",1198713600,9,519,5.046511627906977
8216237,1,B000V1Z0OO,"Well done film for children, nice slow pace and engaging. Except when the DVD stalls or skips. This was shipped by a third party rather than ChoiceVideos, which makes wonder if it is a pirated copy. Has anyone else had this problem?

Terrible shame because it is really excellent, if only it played, sigh",1494201600,,304,4.62962962962963

I imagine that it may be a five-star DVD if I can view it, but I may like to return it if we cannot get it to play.  There is just one problem:  I wrote my name on the DVD in permanent ink!!",1376784000,,336,3.44
8216246,4,B000V1Z0OO,"""The City of Bees: A Children's Guide to Bees"" (rated for grades K-6), Frejas Brn Film and Sound,  2007, 30 minutes; originally a Danish Production but in English.

 This video uses a pleasant mix of child's voice alternative with a kind and simple explanation from a beekeeper. It begins by comparing the hive to houses; hence the title with ""city."" The life cycle of bees begins with flower dust (=pollen), the queen and her egg-laying, and the marking of queens to determine their age. While the statement that they ""come out of hibernation"" is technically incorrect, this is the only flaw and it is not important at this level.  Throughout, the hive is referred to as a ""city"" which conjures up the purposeful decision-making of humans which of course is not the case with bees whose behavior is nearly all ""hardwired.""

 The sequence of concepts are as follows: guard bees use smell recognition to permit entrance of bees to the hive, bees gather ""flower dust"" (later clarified as pollen), water is important to a hive, pollen is placed in pollen cells, pollen is stored on worker bee's hind legs, bees spend 3 days as eggs, honey bees are busy feeding the larvae, and royal jelly is one special food.

 At this point it uses children's chatter and their running in the field to convey the speed that bees fly; this part may seem contrived to some students, but a teacher can decide on preview. Other reviewers have indicated that this segment is ""odd"" for adult viewers.

 Concepts continue: propolis is the building material to fill cracks and serves as a medicine to kill bacteria and fungus [important since honey is heavily sugar, a protectant against bacteria but an excellent food for bacteria, not mentioned in the video], a new bee emerges, feeds and cleans the cell for additional usage, then serves to feed larvae, then produces royal jelly for queen production, and ventilation of the hive.  Use of a smoker to calm bees is shown, but the actual evolutionary selection for this (forest fire is coming, cool the hive first) is not given, and this is admittedly an advanced concept.  A dead mouse enveloped in propolis is tossed out by the beekeeper. Concepts continue: pollination of flowers, transfer of nectar to honey-maker bees that mix it with enzymes to make honey, construction bees, and again the guard bees checking for strangers by smell. Good footage shows the bee stinging us and they pulling away, with the stinger being pulled out of the bee resulting in the bee dying, also water evaporation by bee wings ventilating, and bees foraging. The video uses the term ""gatherer"" rather than forager. Orientation is shown, where the bees use the sun as compass and relay it by dance communication in relation to the sun. Bee videos never seem to reveal that it is completely dark in that hive and the bees have to ""feel"" this direction, not see it from our above-the-frame perspective.

 Finally the ""city divides"" (or swarms). Concepts: the construction of the special queen cell, the older queen leaves after piping (good footage) to attract some to leave with her. Scent is the major communication to keep swarm together. She will mate with roughly 18 drones and this also has superb footage. She returns to lay eggs for about 7 years. Finally, they show honey harvesting and mention the death of worker bees at about 50 days from the egg stage.

 This video comes with a still photo gallery of 15 scenes from the video, but were of lower resolution than the video.  It also provides a lesson plan website at: http://www.choice.web.aplus.netguidebook.html that was still active in June, 2013.",1371513600,2,3618,4.847402597402597
