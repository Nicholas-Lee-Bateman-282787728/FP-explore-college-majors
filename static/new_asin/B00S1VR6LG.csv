8696945,2,B00S1VR6LG,"I received this movie on time - Thank you. However my husband and I were quite disappointed. One out of three of these films were almost worth our time. All were quite dated, with two of them quite hard to hear. David and Goliath was the hardest to view/hear. Oh well, we had heard a lot about Orson Wells (from the previous generation). We haven't been impressed, and these haven't helped.",1440547200,,390,4.507042253521127
8696946,1,B00S1VR6LG,"I wrote a review and it must have gotten censored.  So just let me say don't waste your money on this terrible collection of junk.  It's the very worst of Orson Welles, except for The Stranger saved by Edward G's marvelous portrayal.",1432512000,,233,4.523809523809524
8696947,5,B00S1VR6LG,"The quality of the films in this collection are good but watchable; although, The Southern Star is the best quality and it's in Widescreen. You can probably get a better quality of The Stranger from Kino and the quality of Lady from Shanghai is quite good. As for David And Goliath, it's not in Widescreen and it's an okay video quality. Overall this is a good collection and I would recommend this.",1426723200,11,399,4.555555555555555
