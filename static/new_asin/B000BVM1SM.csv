2443309,5,B000BVM1SM,"There are some TV shows that break new ground, and for the most part, it is the British who blaze the trail.  Like Absolutely Fabulous and the League of Gentlemen before it, Night Night doesn't push the envelope of outrageous comedy and good taste, it leapfrogs it, setting new standards of limits.  It does so not in the vapid, nicked, and uninspired frolicking in familiar materieal of Little Britain (even bad shows can manage awards), but in a surprisingly subtle and even insidious way.  Please search writer and performer Julia Davis' comedy pedegree (including work with the vaunted Steve Coogan, and you shall see why her hitting the comedy bullseye with Night Night is no accident.  While some will be uncomfortable with MS, physical disability, and assistive, adaptive technology along with alleged abuses by family members being ripe for satire, one can't help but laugh anyway. Now, you understand this is not for Friends and Seinfeld junior classmen.  The hideous comparison of Nighty Night with the non-laughter effect, poorly executed, awkward and stammering performances of inferior actors coping with inferior material (not bothering to write a script, even a thoughtless one, makes for a really cheap show that HBO can't help but air by merits of economy, not comedy) to Curb Your Entusiam declared on the DVD package is the height of cynicism by equally cheap-skate Warner Home Video (they won't pay fees to use Ab Fab's real, signature opening music of the old 70's song ""This Wheel's on Fire"" that sets the mood so perfectly, nor will they pay fees for other music used prominently in many other BBC TV series--therefore, it is edited out in U.S. DVD releases)affirms the notion that the the market clods at Warner have never watched Nighty Night or, worse, are attempting to lure those raised on mediocrity in television into something for which they surely aren't ready.  Nighty Night and Curb Your Enthusiam have not a thing in common.  Nighty Night is beyond the cutting edge; be prepared to be shocked; then be shoced that you laugh.

While series 1 delights in its subtle methods--one of the most hilarious scenes involves sexuality, but rather than resort to the quick and crass knock-down exercises seen on Little Britain, Julia Davis allows for silence to play-out as each character is allowed the classic comedic reaction to the scene--series 2 seems to go for the more obvious, and slightly less thougtful gags.  However, the first episode of series 2 is among the enitire series' best, but the final episode of series 2 is the weakest, and Julia's attempt to tie up the loose ends makes for a strangley unsatisfying ending to such superior episodes preceeding it.

We must forgive Ms. Davis, for she is only human, and overall, so much of Nighty Night is so strong and clever, refreshingly shocking, as is most of the best comedy created in our culture.  This is not the flaccid Arrested Develpment.  Nighty Night is the real thing.  Truely fresh, grond-breaking comedy that will hvae you howling, provided you are old enough to graduate from Scrubs to watch what grown-ups who have seen it all, view.",1163116800,8,3134,4.935361216730038
2443310,5,B000BVM1SM,"Julia Davis is a Goddess! This series is not only dark and humorous it touches into the deep psychic maliciousness of getting what one wants at all cost! I do not like the Curb Your Enthusiasm comparison because I loathe that show. I would compare Nighty Night with a touch of AB FAB, a sprinkle of Black Books, a hefty dose of The Office and a dash of Fawlty Towers. That's all that needs to be said! I have bought numerous Britcoms with no knowledge of what I would be getting; just taking a chance. This started 9 years ago and I have not been disappointed once!",1148083200,10,565,4.289719626168225

For the next three hours, we were absolutely shocked and entertained.  This has got to be one of the most original shows ever to be created.  Its got it all; comedy, drama and twisted minds.  I have to admit I've taken a few lessons from Jill and her methods do work.  Seriously though it was just plain amazing and I hope series two will be out soon.  It is not for the easily offended but for those there is always the Brady bunch; the lamest thing ever to grace television.  For the rest of us, well...Nighty Night.  Highly recommended.",1147651200,15,695,4.2846153846153845

2443314,5,B000BVM1SM,"""Nighty Night"" is one of those programs that truly causes the jaw to drop, even for those of us who are accustomed to edgy comedy. It really keeps you guessing.

I am a huge fan of ""Strangers With Candy"", and when I initially got into that, I thought... ""wow, what a bizarre and politically incorrect concoction.""  ""Nighty Night"" is politically incorrect in its own hilarious way, but it seems far more ""out there"" to me, probably because I was raised in the US.  Buttons get pushed in ""Nighty Night"" that simply don't happen in American programming, even on the raciest of cable programs.

The writing is clever and the characters well developed. The acting is admirable, particularly on the part of Rebecca Front.

It's hard to say anything about this show without giving it away, and it's a bit pointless to speak about it in really vague terms.  I'd recommend it without hesitation to anyone interested in quality, boundary-pushing comedy.  If you're easily offended, and you think ""Friends"" is the best show ever, you probably won't enjoy ""Nighty Night"".",1138492800,5,1059,4.88268156424581
2443315,5,B000BVM1SM,"Pathos, uncomfortableness, engrossing, gross, realistic, surrealistic, offensive in every way and totally brilliant!

2443317,5,B000BVM1SM,"Every so often a sitcom comes along that stays with you for a very long time after you've watched it, and ""Nighty Night"", the BBC's most recent sitcom-to-DVD conversion, is just such a thing.

Jill Tyrell (Julia Davis, the show's writer and creator, and a fabulous comedy actress, to boot), a beautician in a nondescript Northern town, is devastated to learn that her husband Terry (Kevin Eldon) has cancer. This happens to be the first scene of the first episode, and it's the last rational reaction you'll see for the next three hours. Jill, not one to rest on her laurels, decides a new man is the order of the day, and, before Terry is even ill, much less dead, deposits him in the hospital and heads off to find a man. Enter the unlucky Don (Angus Deayton), and his multiple sclerosis-afflicted wife Cathy (Rebecca Front), as Jill's new neighbours. Deciding that he's the man for her, and blindly ignoring the fact that Terry doesn't seem to be getting any sicker, Jill goes about driving a wedge between Don and Cathy, and keeping Terry's presence a secret from all and sundry.

As with ""The League of Gentlemen"", ""Nighty Night"" is a comedy that gets laughs from its situational absurdity. The main characters, with the exception of Jill, are portrayed beautifully as normal, rational people cast headlong into an unreasonable situation, but, thanks to the machinations of the ensemble of secondary characters (such as the gloriously funny Ruth Jones as Jill's long-suffering employee and friend Linda, and the wickedly irreverent Mark Gatiss as her erstwhile paramour Glenn Bulb), they soon find themselves descending to a level of abnormality that they're clearly not comfortable with. Happily, this makes for the best viewing, and ""Nighty Night"" is one of the best comedies to come out of Britain in recent years.

Julia Davis as Jill is monstrously cruel, totally self-centred and completely sociopathic, but, as with all good anti-heroes, she manages to generate such sympathy for the character that we are rooting for her to win, in the end. It's a brilliant portrayal of a character, that, in the hands of a lesser actress or with less care taken over the finer points of the script, could easily have sunk into one-dimensional nastiness. Happily, Davis has created in Jill Tyrell a sitcom heroine to rival - and beat - the likes of Basil Fawlty, Patsy Stone and Vicki Pollard at their own game.

I'm not going to give anything away, so I'm going to end my review here, suffice it so say that here are three of the best and funniest hours you could ever own on DVD. Extras - outtakes and almost twenty minutes of deleted scenes - are wonderful, and the audio/video quality is, as one would expect from the BBC, top-drawer.

Wholeheartedly recommended as an essential purchase.",1134345600,21,2789,4.850840336134453
2443318,4,B000BVM1SM,"NIGHTY NIGHT is one of the most accomplished and subtle comedies to emerge from the BBC in recent years.  Julia Davis wrote and starred in the series, playing monstrous Jill Tyrell, a self-centered egomaniac who discovers her long-suffering husband Terry (Kevin Eldon) has cancer.  Despite Terry's quite hopeful prognosis, the first thing Jill does is sign up with a dating agency, then places Terry in a nursing home and tells everyone he has died...before setting her sights on her handsome new doctor neighbour Don (Angus Deayton).  Jill's only obstacle lies with Cathy (Rebecca Front), Don's wheelchair-bound wife.  Using every cunning trick and insult at her disposal, Jill will stop at nothing to claim Don for herself.

Julia Davis is fabulous playing Jill, a character with absolutely NO redeeming qualities.  Patsy from ""AbFab"" looks like Mary Poppins pruning the rosebushes compared to Jill!  The DVD contains all 6 episodes from the first series.

This isn't your usual ""vanilla slice-Sunday afternoon"" comedy from the Beeb...",1132012800,18,1037,5.319018404907975

I understand, however, why some people have a problem with this comedy.  The star is truly psychotic.  I couldn't believe some of the stuff I was watching.

2443324,1,B000BVM1SM,"I'm a big George Michael fan and he mentioned liking this series when interviewed after getting out of hospital post-pnemonia (sp?), so I checked it out from the library to have a look.  All the actresses/actors were good; I give it one star because the lead character ran so roughshod over everyone around her and no one checked her, which I found unbelievable.  Yes she owned her own salon so I can understand her employees having to put up with her, and yes I can accept that she chose a husband she could walk all over, but every single other character she interacted with took her guff, in as many episodes as I could stand to watch (couldn't get through all of them), with very little to no complaint.  Even her customers were abused.  What successful small business owner would be such a dolt that she would run roughshod over her own customers; how could she stay in business.  Obviously she couldn't.  And she lived in a small village, not London, so word of mouth about her would quickly get around town, and she'd have no customers and therefore no business.  I understand that in real life, often out of politeness, people will not contradict an overbearing stranger, but the lead treated every single other character abominably and she got away with it every time (again wasn't interested enough in her to watch all the episodes). As the lead character isn't rich, famous or especially beautiful (not a knock at the lead, who is attractive, just obvious she isn't playing a high-end star) in the story, no reason for anyone but her employees, and possibly her husband, to put up with her.  One star due to unbelievable character interactions.  Lead actress was good, I thought she had a good time with the part.  If characters behave unbelievably in a story, how is the audience supposed to care about them.  The lead character was believable as a self-obsessed bully, but the surrounding characters were not believable in the way they reacted to her (except, as previously noted, her employees/husband).  Poorly written secondary characters.  Plus lead character was one note, didn't flush her out.  She started out obnoxious and stayed that way throughout (witnessed same behavior in final episode).  Most people in the audience don't know how a beauty salon is run, but every single person is an expert on human behavior/interaction (because we've been interacting with others since birth) and when an especially unbelievable character interaction is featured in a story, it makes it harder for audience to suspend disbelief, I think is the literary phrase.  Ugh, is my phrase.  As a woman, I want more roles featuring women, but if characters don't interact in a recognizable (i.e., human) way, then a story/series featuring a woman is unengaging.  I want more women's roles, but in quality, well-written projects.  I understand the lead actress wrote this, and it's been off awhile now, so she's probably gotten better.  I look forward to seeing more of her work and seeing her progression/improvement.  She's obviously talented; she can write a lead who gets the audience's attention, just needs to create a fictitious world in which her lead ""lives.""",1370217600,,3170,4.909943714821764

2443330,5,B000BVM1SM,"I got this DVD by accident. I had ordered something else and instead I got ""Nighty Night"" - which I knew nothing about. I lucked out. Jill Tyrell is one of the great fictitious female monsters, like Lady MacBeth and Hillary Clinton. (Personal note: I actually saw the woman who plays the Hillary Clinton character when she was running for ""President."" She was wearing a yellow and black pants suit which - with her fat ass - made her look like a bumble bee on steroids.) Jill is such a self-centered sociopath that she would fit into the U.S. Senate. Instead she runs a beauty salon in a small town in the west of England. Her assistant is an obese woman she calls ""Linderrr,"" who speaks with what I think is a Welsh accent. Jill is very soft spoken. She never raises her voice. (Neither did Joseph Stalin.) Reading some of the other reviews I see that some people just don't get Jill. This is sad. For there is an inner Jill in all of us - and to see it sprout like a poisonous fungus is a joy to behold. Julie Davis is a genius.",1257897600,2,1030,4.260204081632653

2443334,5,B000BVM1SM,"There's not a lot I can add to what previous reviewers have said about this show. Suffice to say that Julia Davis' writing, and timing, are impeccable as ever, and if you haven't scene her deadpanning her way through her gig in The Alan Clarke Diaries as the secretary of the eponymous anti-hero (Played by John Hurt), then that's definitely worth a look, too.

I've got a bit of a ""comedy exchange"" thang going on with a mate in Australia, and mailing this over is my response to Summer Heights High, the latest ""mockumentary"" comedy by Chris Lilley on ABC over there. That one's the best comedy (anywhere) since Kath & Kim (although I personally think that a second series would be pushing it - without entirely new characters), and it's raised the bar so high, in terms of sick, cackle-inducing spectacle, that Nighty Night is the only UK-produced comedy I can think of that lives up to it. Little Britain? Forget it! Anyway, sketch shows are doomed to repetition.

That said, I wouldn't bother with Series 2 of Nighty Night again - which I caught when it was aired on BBC2 - as there are limits to which even I can stretch my disbelief, even if the soft-rock soundtrack was a hoot. Lord knows, nothing can shock me - maybe I'm even a little jaded - and Ruth Jones is great again as downtrodden Linda, but when Davis has her concealing a large trout in her nether regions for no particular reason other than a cheap laugh, it's time to give it the wide berth that recent John Waters films deservedly get these days.

(After you've seen the artificial insemination scene in the hospital you'll understand completely.)  Here's a call to the BBC to release Series Two in America.  The actress/writer said she can't imagine there'll be Series Three because she's not sure where the story might head.  Let's hope she changes her mind and that Cath, Glenn, Don, and ""Linder"" will find the light of day again.
