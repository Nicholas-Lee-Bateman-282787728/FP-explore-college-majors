7951325,5,B00005QW4T,"Saw all 3 of these when I was a boy - not a lot of strong memories of CFTHS, but remember exactly that one Saturday morning I saw 3 films in this order - Beast From Haunted Cave (slightly unnerved me), The 27th Day (with Gene Barry) and The Wasp Woman - this last one scared me.  Still have fond thoughts of them - met Michael Forest (BFHC) about 10 years ago -- he also played Apollo on Star Trek - got autographed photos of Apollo and Haunted Cave.  Of The Wasp Woman, extremely sad that to hear that her son beat her to death in 1986.  Great actress!",1375660800,,553,4.055045871559633
7951326,5,B00005QW4T,"Creature Movies .. are just great camp classics from, Roger Corman. I when to the show as a kid in the early 60's & for 25 cent, I got to see two movies. Wow! I was in heaven, at that moment & yes, I saw all three at the show & love them & even now, I enjoy them as great old B-Movies & Roger, knew how to make them, cheap & fun & maded a damm good living from it. ""Creature From The Haunted Cave"" is fun & silly but, fun. ""Beast From Haunted Cave"" . I love to watch & The Wasp Woman, is Cult Classic & best of all three. So if you got time & love old Horror B-Movies from the 60's, all I can say is watch & rock on. Great price, all three on one DVD, how can miss great fun ....",1156464000,3,679,3.5945945945945947
7951327,4,B00005QW4T,"roger corman was and always will be the ""king of the b movies"", and as his book said,he made over 200 movies in hollywood and never lost money on any of them,lets see other directors make that claim!!! what makes these movies,indeed,all of cormans movies so much fun is the fact that with little or no money he made movies that were fun to watch and fun to revisit time after time. you can sence that he was doing everything he could to make a movie that you would enjoy,and thats the charm of mr. corman,he wants you to have a good time,and if you think he didn't know that some of these movies were pure cheese then you don't get mr. corman or his movies,as most were made tounge in cheek anyway.

settle back and watch these great cheese movies and have a ball.",1146009600,,764,4.268965517241379
7951328,2,B00005QW4T,"These movies were simply awful. OK, The Wasp Woman wasn't all THAT bad, but Creature from the Haunted Sea was literally one of the five worst movies I have ever seen, and Beast from Haunted Cave was one of the ten worst. But all in all I did not feel cheated, since I only paid $5.98, which is less than $2/movie. So buy it if you must, but don't expect to ""feel the magic"", because it just ain't there. Better off to put your money toward the Ed Wood Box or a copy of Robot Monster.",1130112000,2,483,4.041666666666667
7951329,4,B00005QW4T,"This DVD is terrific. I enjoyed all three movies, each with its own special flavor.
The Beast From THe Haunted Sea is terrifically spoofy. It pokes fun at all the spy genre and the mass hysteria during the Cold War. A bumbling undercover spy infiltrates a wacky group of smugglers with deserters from the Cuban Army thrown in for good measure. The effects are lousy, the dialogue is intentionally awful but funny and th eBeast look like the Cookie Monster with Seaweed.
THe BEast From Hacuted Cave is different, darker and not bad. It involves a criminal gang who steals some gold and tricks a heroic ski guide to take them to his cabin to hide out. During the robbery, a beast was awaken or freed by the explosion and follows the crooks and proceeds to capture them one by one. Only the heroic ski guide and the chief crook's moll excape.
Corman has a flair for the dramatic and a good sense of what kind of story he wanted to tell. Unfortunately, his skills and budgets often prevented him from achieving his goals. Corman epitomizes the adage
A man's grasp must exceed his reach
Else what's a heaven for?!
I will buy more of his works.",1017187200,9,1138,4.502415458937198
