7786476,4,B01HEXY0U6,"Harmony presents a wonderfully intriguing dystopian concept, namely that of a utopia. An obsession with good health has lead to a society where no one dies and everyone strives to support each other, and Tuan hates it for the loss of personal control over ones own body that comes with it. With a past haunted by loss and a failed attempt at the ultimate act of rebellion, Tuan will face her own beliefs and doubts when someone else decides to shake up the perfect society.

Once Ive decided Im going to see a movie I generally don't do much research ahead of time. Having now seen Harmony I went back and read Funimations summary. I highly recommend avoiding it if you haven't read it yet, as in my opinion it spoils some key plot reveals that were a surprise as I was watching.

Harmony raises numerous philosophical questions, and has interesting things to say about them. Concepts ranging from the natures of consciousness and happiness to what an ideal society really is are explored. The central plot and action are decent, but lets be honest: its all a vehicle for the philosophical dilemmas and messages. I found it engaging, but even I disagree with a lot of the conclusions it seems to draw, and some viewers may find them off putting. And one of the twists with the most potential turned out to be largely a throwaway to set up something else.

Still, the moral and philosophical issues raised are thought provoking and will stay with me for a long while. Overall while Harmony could have been much more whats here is good enough and its worth checking out.",1475107200,3,1568,4.612903225806452
7786477,2,B01HEXY0U6,"It might be a cultural difference, but I felt lost, the story line was simple, but several parts were not explained well, especially the end. Maybe that was the point, to start conversation about it.",1474156800,,199,4.714285714285714
7786478,5,B01HEXY0U6,Wonderful movie.  Great animation.  There is a lot of philosophy and what not but it is still very enjoyable and entertaining.  It has some similar themes to Empire of Corpses about the soul and the nature of life.  The voice acting was spot on and everything was well done.  Definitely worth the price.,1474156800,4,303,4.6415094339622645

7786480,3,B01HEXY0U6,"While I found it engaging, I also found it a little convoluted.  It also fizzled out a bit at the end IMHO.  I'm being purposely ambiguous here.

There are some graphic bits of violence, and adult relationship situations. You've been warned?

Also the audio is in english -- if that matters to you",1473724800,2,297,4.547169811320755
7786481,1,B01HEXY0U6,"I don't have the Bluray but I did go see the film screened in the theaters in Austin.  After watching the first Project Itoh film, which I enjoyed (even though you needed to see the Easter egg at the end of the film to get it).  I came into this film with hopes that it would also be a decent watch; however, I was highly disappointed in this film.  Waiting for stuff to happen, or for the plot to take form, it was a slow trod.  I collect a lot of anime, regardless of how good or bad they are, but I can say I will definitely not be owning a copy of this film.  I don't think I can sit through another viewing of this film, of course art is subjective, so others might feel differently about this film.  For me, I just left the theater not caring about any of the characters, wishing there was more action to make up for it but I could not get anything from it.  Maybe I would say its worth at least a watch, but people might hate me for that too.  I would recommend renting this before you dip into your funds and making the purchase.",1473638400,6,1037,4.024390243902439
7786482,5,B01HEXY0U6,"Don't miss this fantastic Studio4*C & Funimation project directed by Takashi Nakamura & Michael Arias.. Excellent CGI animation, character design and development. Subject matter is in your face thought provoking and in my opinion more factual and present reality than futuristic science fiction. You will want this in the near future. Study this. Buy the book. If you watch this for entertainment, your missing the point. Ergo Proxy has been overtaken in my library of must haves by my new #1 ..... <Harmony>. You won't thank me now but you'll thank me later ......... BUY THIS.  Thank-you Satoshi Ito.
I now own 15 copies of this. steelbox sets, dvd's, blu-rays and limited editions. 6 copies of the book. movie posters, artbook, t-shirts. I've watched this movie more than 30 times. Studied every frame, every word & symbol. I don't know if the writers(script) and movie designers of this, truly understand themselves what they have created ..... but I do. THIS IS AMAZING.
I will do a +/- quote from another movie to again recommend Harmony. "" WHY, is the only real true .... it's what separates us from them, you from me."" Thank-you project Itoh and redjuice for character design.",1498262400,,1184,4.92

7786485,4,B01HEXY0U6,"A wonderfully thought-provoking tale that involves the concept that human lives are a precious resource (Lifeism) in a future Japan (Nippon) that goes to totalitarian extremes to secure that resource by national mandate connecting every person to a centralized Health Management System (MediCare) using wireless implants and nanotechnology (WatchMe).

Using this as a backdrop is the central story involving a woman named Tuan (Toh-wan) who works for the World Health Organization (WHO) and her emotional struggles with the contrast between the ""perfect"" world of her life in Japan and the rest of the world. The story switches between her early depressed teen years growing up without her scientist father who abandoned the family and with her two close girlfriends Cian (Kee-yan) and the complicated/rebellious Miach (Miya-ha), and as an adult (13 years later).

Tuan is assigned to investigate a case involving the suicide of random individuals connected to the MediCare system by a mysterious group using mind control. The case takes a strange turn involving someone from Tuan's past...",1491696000,,1090,5.443786982248521

7786487,5,B01HEXY0U6,"Having read Itoh's book I was a little skeptical with how all that dense, cerebral story was going to translate to film. So many layers. Very deep. Beyond the mystery/detective story itself, you can really feel the frustration of the author, Itoh, as he literally lay dying finishing writing the book. Visually, what Japan did with the film was stunning! But to me, watching the subbed version, it didn't really capture the same feeling as the book. The English dub however was another story! Funimation did a fantastic job! The same haunting feeling from the book permeated the entire movie. I won't post any spoilers, but considering what's been going on in the world lately, the attention to detail they put in heightened the creepy, 1984 factor. The script, direction, and performances by the lead actresses were really top notch!  AND THE END! OMG! If you like Black Mirror, watch this. Seriously.",1483747200,3,902,4.934210526315789

7786491,4,B01HEXY0U6,"Harmony, based on the science fiction novel by Satoshi It, depicts a world in which mandatory mental and physical health is imposed on the population by constant monitoring through networked bio-mechanical devices implanted in each person's body. Civilization is now synonymous with participation in this system, only the underdeveloped areas of the world refuse (or simply cannot) be a part of this scheme.

Harmony's main drawback is the animation style, which is crude, especially compared to the gorgeous Empire of Corpses, the other Project Itoh adaptation from 2015.  However, I thought that Harmony had a much more engaging and sophisticated story with some intriguing ideas, whereas Empire of Corpses quickly exhausted its premise and devolved into a convoluted and implausible mess.",1476576000,,791,5.528925619834711

8765315,3,B01HEXY0U6,"arguably the worst of the 3 Project itoh movies, which is odd considering the book this is based off of won the most awards. I had a hard time staying engaged watching this movie as did the rest of the people who watched it. I'll make this a spoiler free review and say the action happens in the first 20 mins and the rest of the movie follows a predictable route through a pepto bismol colored world.

I recommend the other 2 movies(Empire of Corpses, Genocidial Origin) over this one.",1529107200,,486,4.4
8765316,2,B01HEXY0U6,"Ok, let's start with I also have Empire of Corpses so I came in going oh wow this is going to be awesome oh wow. Uh, no. Animation great., plot good, voices good, but it just fell flat. Boring and steeped in anger and a hate of a society that is not just obsessed with health but being cloyingly kind to your neighbor. The disgust and hate and constant reminding of 'I hate this one thought, one way society' just keeps your mind focused on that and doesn't allow for anything else. The movie therefore becomes boring, depressing, and just plain bad quickly. I didn't even make it through the whole movie.",1526601600,,605,4.410714285714286
