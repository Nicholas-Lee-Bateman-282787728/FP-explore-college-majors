The presentation is good but could have used a fair bit more polish. The individuals making the presentation I believe were knowledgeable but lack a bit of organization.(camera spooked) If your goal is to differentiate between similar basic maneuvers then you won't be disappointed. If you goal is to find several practicable forms then it is lacking, Accurate, but lacking.

There is lots of great instruction on here. That being said it is VERY instructional. There is nothing exciting other than it's instructional benefit. I only gave it a four because it is a bit boring but, it does the job. It instructs you on Japanese swordsmanship. I am learning from it. I will be buying the rest of the series.",1346112000,10,533,4.393939393939394

3175497,4,B0017TCSLW,"I recently came into possession of a very fine, pre-war set of Japanese Samurai swords.  As an author, I happen to be more familiar with Roman and Greek weapons, so I ordered this DVD to get a feel for my new Katanas.

Yeah, we've all seen the Samurai movies, and those guys make it look so easy, right? However, I'm not gonna start swinging around a sharp blade without first learning something about it. So I thought this was a solid investment.

After watching the first little bit (Blah, blah, sword terminology, yadda, yadda, tradition, etc.)I started learning. And learning a lot. First and foremost, what I was doing WRONG. Now it had my attention.

Yes, this is a ""Basics"" DVD. They're not gonna make you an instant badass off of one video. This is the building blocks of it all, like, oh, for instance, HOW TO HOLD A SWORD IN THE FIRST PLACE! You'd be amazed how many are doing it wrong. Even in those fancy samurai movies. Hell, I was doing it wrong! This is some seriously great stuff.

Yeah, we've all seen the Samurai movies, and those guys make it look so easy, right? However, I'm not gonna start swinging around a sharp blade without first learning something about it. So I thought this was a solid investment.

After watching the first little bit (Blah, blah, sword terminology, yadda, yadda, tradition, etc.)I started learning. And learning a lot. First and foremost, what I was doing WRONG. Now it had my attention.

Yes, this is a ""Basics"" DVD. They're not gonna make you an instant badass off of one video. This is the building blocks of it all, like, oh, for instance, HOW TO HOLD A SWORD IN THE FIRST PLACE! You'd be amazed how many are doing it wrong. Even in those fancy samurai movies. Hell, I was doing it wrong! This is some seriously great stuff.
