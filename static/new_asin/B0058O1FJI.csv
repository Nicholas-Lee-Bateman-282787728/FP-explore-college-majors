8461981,2,B0058O1FJI,"""Madso's War"" is a gritty but predictable made-for-television crime thriller about violent gang warfare in Boston. Unfortunately, you've seen this familiar story unfold before in better movies made for the big screen such as ""The Departed,"" ""The Town,"" ""State of Grace,"" and the two ""Boondock Saints"" epics. Director Rob Marcus and writer Christopher Bertolini keep the action moving fast enough during the film's 84 minutes so that it doesn't bog down in details. Basically, after a notorious crime boss--based on real-life kingpin James ""Whitey"" Bulger--vanishes, the men who served under him grow fractious and start killing each other. The problem with Bertolini's actioneer is that it lacks the ingredients to be a first-rate thriller. The characters are neither interesting nor amusing. There is no comic relief and nothing memorable occurs. The murders and the executions look moderately bloody for a television movie, but this shoot'em up never seizes you by the ears and surprises you with twists and turns. Instead, ""Madso's War"" is straightforward and standard-issue. Matthew Marsden is fine as the eponymous street hood that goes to war against rival gangsters after they ice two of his crew. Harris Yulin appears briefly as the legendary crime boss who disappears after the Feds indict him. Not only does he leave a power vacuum in his wake, but also he has stashed about $12 million from a job.  Our hero's friends let him down on a job and try to unearth the fortune that the crime boss salted away. Michel `Madso' Madden (Matthew Marsden of ""Rambo"") is the equivalent of a foot soldier. He grew up in the Southie part of Boston and stands between two gangs of lethal goons. The first gang takes their orders from tough-guy Gerry Walker (Kevin Chapman of CBS-TV's ""Person of Interest"") and the second follow a duo known only as the two Dannys. One of the Dannys is Danny Driscoll (Daniel Patrick Kelly of ""Commando""), and the Dannys and Gerry are constantly at each other's throats, with a couple of corrupt Boston cops skulking on the sidelines. When things become a little too volatile for our protagonist, Madso summons his trigger-happy cousin from Ireland, Kieran (Timothy V. Murphy) who knows a thing or two about killing. ""Madso's War"" qualifies as a pale imitation of better crime thrillers.",1343433600,,2314,5.057591623036649
8461982,5,B0058O1FJI,"In Boston, the head of the Irish mafia, nearing an indictment, disappears leaving a power vacuum and turf wars between some heavy hitters that don't play games. There is the matter of the missing $11-12 million dollars from a bank robbery that has people guessing. As bodies turn up, the Feds get involved. This is a typical crime movie with killings, gang girls, and tough talk. This movie has a fairly decent rock sound track. They frequently use the split screen technique to show us they used 2 cameras to film the same scene. The pace is decent. The plot is easy to follow. Matthew Marsden plays Madso, a mid-level crime boss trying to survive and figure out what is happening around him as his world caves in. Solid 4 1/2 stars. 5 if your Irish.

8461985,5,B0058O1FJI,"Matthew Marsden was excellant in this portrayal of Irish Boston mobsters. I thought he did a damn fine job with the Irish accent. Hard to do I would think when you have a Brittish accent like his. I wonder if it is due to his being of Irish decent that influenced him to do this movie. The characters were very real and gritty just like the real life counter parts. The power struggle within the ""family"" was true to form. The struggle of these characters to survive the mean streets of Boston is portrayed with realism. The struggle of some to rise above what they were born into but seem to always fall back to what they've known is touched on, but mostly it's about the void left by the head mobster disappearing and the resulting clash of the lower ranks in the bid to take over. Never realizing that some corrupt cops are causing the mayhem. I hope to see Matthew Marsden in more films in the future. I think he has some real talent that Hollywood hasn't tapped. Watch the movie, I think you will like it.",1316390400,2,1010,4.349206349206349
