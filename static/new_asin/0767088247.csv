21786,5,0767088247,"'Rumpole of the Bailey' is one of my favourite book series, and is also one of my favourite television series of all time.  Spanning well over a decade, Thames television produced over 40 episodes of the crusty old barrister's tales, penned both for book and screen by John Mortimer, who used to take delight in highlighting silliness in judicial judgements by putting those decisions into the guise of his own judges, perhaps most especially judge Bullingham.

Leo McKern, a well-known British character actor perhaps most famous internationally for 'A Man for All Seasons' and 'Shoes of the Fisherman', found this great role late in life, and became the quintessential image for Rumpole.  He performed the role through all the episodes (presented in the UK originally starting in 1978, and continuing with a few gaps through 1992, and presented in the USA via the PBS Mystery series approximately the same time), joined by two different actresses portraying Hilda Rumpole (Peggy Thorpe-Bates and Marion Mathie), affectionately referred to as 'She Who Must Be Obeyed'.  Rumpole's mannerisms and penchant for the less genteel things in life are done by McKern in a perfect contrast to the others in Chambers, be they Guthrie Featherstone (played by Peter Bowles as an upper-middle, Conservative-Labour MP QC) or 'Soapy Sam' Ballard (Peter Blythe), Claude Erskine-Brown (Julian Curry) or Phyllida Erskine-Brown ne Trant (Patricia Hodge).

There are set pieces about these episodes, but they are far from formulaic.  Unlike some American counterparts with which one might hazard a comparison, Rumpole does not always win the case, although he almost always solves the mystery.  Rarely do cases turn on points of law (indeed, Phyllida Erskine-Brown, the 'Portia' of Chambers once remarked that Rumpole knew nothing of law, but did know how to win over a jury), but the cases usually involve issues of eccentricity, both among those in the legal profession as well as among those who have need of the legal profession.  Most shows involve several subplots, and the line between victory and defeat is often blurry.  However, there will always be an England, at least in certain ways:  As Rumpole said once during a defence, the English nation when it is long gone will be remembered for three things -- the English breakfast, the Oxford Book of English Verse (the Quiller-Couch Edition), and the presumption of innocence - this is Rumpole's mantra, and his statement of faith.

Rumpole is always for the defense - even in the later story of 'Rumpole for the Prosecution', in which Rumpole is hired to conduct a private prosecution, he manages to provide through his searching for the truth the best defence for the defendant. Rumpole, it seems, will never be anything but the champion for the defence.

This set includes the episodes from each series as well as the two-hour telefilm, 'Rumpole's Return', a re-introduction to Rumpole after the early run of shows which ended with Rumpole nearing retirement.  The disc with 'Rumpole's Return' includes several other bonus features, including a brief biography of John Mortimer, a brief history of the Old Bailey, and a list of executioners of the Old Bailey neighbouring Newgate Prison, the last of whom performed his final duty in 1902.

This is a great set piece that fans of mystery, fans of legal drama (with more than a small hint of wit and, occasionally, the ridiculous) and fans of British television generally will find a joy to view.  Sit back with your favourite glass of red wine (Chateau Fleet Street comes highly recommended) and wander into a London which is a blend of the thoroughly modern and practically medieval.",1145491200,232,3676,5.072968490878939
21787,5,0767088247,For long driving trips we often listen to books on tape.  After listening to the Rumpole tapes several times I bought the entire collection of DVD's for my husband for Christmas.  We both thoroughly enjoy watching this series.  We have long been fans of British comedy and would highly recommend this collection to like-minded people.  Rumpole is a delightful character and the story lines are very entertaining.  Such a welcome relief to all the horrible programing available on television today - VERY ENJOYABLE!!!  Highly recommended.,1137283200,18,537,5.258823529411765
21788,5,0767088247,"And worth every penny!!!

I now own the entire series, and it is so delightful to be able to escape the horrors of network news programs, local ""breaking news"" reports (the latest car chase), and phony ""reality"" shows, and to sit down with a nice glass of Trader Joe's Plonk (the California equivalent of Chateau Thames Embankment) and indulge in an unadulterated orgy of Rumpole from beginning to end.

A curious warmth envelops one when mulling over Rumpole's private life in Froxbury Mansions, under the guidance of the iron-handed Hilda--She Who Must Be Obeyed; or pondering the barrister's professional life at Number 3, Equity Court, under the mis-guidance of the scatty Guthry Featherstone or the unctuous Soapy Sam Ballard. And what could be more enjoyable than the sniping exchanges between the Ice Queen, Phillida Erskine-Brown and her Wagner-doting spouse, the magnificently inept Claude? What, for that matter, could be more enjoyable than the outraged feminist sensibilities of Mizz Liz Probert, always ready to unleash her radical lawyers on the premises at the first symptoms of patriarchal politesse?

What could be more enjoyable?

Perhaps Rumpole's confrontations at the Bailey in which his strategically deployed nonsense perpetually outwits the common-sensical Red Judge Ollie Oliphant, or when the rumbustious periwig-pated Rumpole silences the sepulchral Mister Justice Graves by speaking the speech as Shakespeare (or, on occasion, Wordsworth) pronounced it, trippingly on the tongue!

Do yourselves a favor. Take an armchair flight to London with the complete series of ""Rumpole of the Bailey."" Beg, borrow, or steal the money.

The mega set is perfect for the Rumpole aficionado and includes some extras, such as the almost 2 hour special episode in which Rumpole returns home from America - from Miami this time, not Baltimore! They must have decided Baltimore was too cold, or too full of Rumpole's usual clientele. There is also a nice short interview with John Mortimer on how he came up with the characters on the show.

He is a public defender with a nose for solving crimes and a wit that seems to run the gamut of English literature, with an occasional quote of poetry as suits the occasion (or not).

Looking forward to rumpole's return which seen 90% of - didn't see last part.

IMHO the sound and video is good. Indoor scenes video is better than outside scenes for 1st 9 DVDs. Before the credits at an episode end there maybe a small rectangle with wiggling diagonal lines in the upper right hand corner, all episodes are prefaced by Mortimer. As others have said there aren't any subtitles.
Leo McKern's video titled McKern's memories is ~ 18 minutes long.  The quality of video and sound for the ""Rumpole's Return"" is same as other episodes. All bonus except for those mentioned above are write-ups on a page NOT a video.
 If you don't have the extras already then this set is ok. If you have all the episodes already it's expensive probably NOT worth it.",1444608000,2,1006,4.672316384180791

With that said, this review is also including the product itself, not just the excellent 5 star series.  The DVD set I found to be lacking a couple of important elements.

First the sound quality was not transferred over very well. I found myself having to crank the volume up in many parts of each story just to barely hear what was being said. This brings up the second issue which was the lack of any CC or SDH subtitles.  I personally prefer the SDH option over CC as it is easier to access for me but there simply wasn't anything to assist me in understanding the low volume parts of each show.

These two important issues brought this collection down to a 3 star rating on the technical aspect so overall it comes out as a 4 star rating.",1443484800,3,1091,4.435

21935,5,0767088247,"I remember first watching ""Rumpole"" aka Leo McKern on PBS when it aired, I believe, for the first time on PBS. I was instantly hooked. McKern just shines and caught the character to the point of making one, almost immediately, think he was actually Rumpole, a real Barrister, playing himself. He was that good. Also, the ensemble cast was just as good and their cohesiveness made the series that much more enjoyable and enchanting. Some time ago I purchased The Complete Series, and I'm sure I must have watched it then. I ""rediscovered"" the set in my garage and immediately started watching it again. I did so, thinking ""I wonder if I'll still enjoy it as much as I first did... or has the shine worn off over time."" I'm about 75% through watching the Complete Series as I type this, and, if possible, think I'm enjoying it even more than the first time... as I just said, if that were possible. If you like a look into a wonderful cast of fine British actors, finely played and extremely entertaining, do yourself a favor. Oh, and be prepared for occasional quotes from Wadsworth, Tennyson, Shakespeare, etc. always interjected at precisely the right time. Oh, and one more thing, also very entertaining, sometimes Rumpole will utter some statement under his breath of a critical nature, aimed at someone, and when they don't quite hear it and ask him to repeat it, he always comes up with a quick phrase that sounds quite like the first comment, but is quite innocuous. I can't think of anything negative to say... and highly recommend this series.",1429920000,,1551,4.705882352941177

21961,5,0767088247,"If you can still find a copy of this complete set of the Rumpole of the Bailey then you are in good shape.  Audio quality is somewhat compormised by a very mild hardly noticable hum and hiss.  It is as if there is a tiny electrical appliance running during all parts of the program.  The noise is not really that bad.  What makes this Rumpole series nice is the author Mortimer gave little introductions to each episode that gave a bit of insight to the goings on you were about to enjoy.

Rumpole was a old Bailey hack who remained always fiercely true to his man of the people ideals. I looked at my entire Rumpole series this set over the recent holiday season.  I was jolted by how much ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"" reminded me of one Hyacinth Bucket.  While our Hyacinth is certainly more over the top than ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"" the bucket woman does not lead by too much in the social climber department.

The video quality is easily 8 out of 10 no artifcats on the screen.  The images are not entirely clearbut good enough.  I am watching on a 65 inch Samsung with 240 MHz and image enhancing software cleaning things up a tad.  The images are good even without image enhancing systems.  The colors are rich deep and true.  Flesh tones are fresh and correct.  the bleak rainy London days and nights are properly rendered.  Inside visuals of 3 Equity Court, chambers, court rooms and country side are all done well.  Colors are pretty darn near vivid.

Audio suffers in that it is hampered by a slight buzz and hiss combination but I was clearly able to hear Rumpole's side bar comments to himself without trouble.  Rumpole honestly needs higher quality sound if the full awesomeness of his stories are to be enjoyed. The best moments of Rumpole happen when he takes his audience into his own mind for a cozy little side bar.  Rumpoles self talk sidebars reveal to us alone delicious little facts and tidbits about goings on.  I love when Rumpole calls us old darling or other such things.  Rumpole speaks to his audience as if he is sharing with us priceless insightful tidbits that only an old Bailey hack like himself would know.  Rumpole often shares with you the issues and interesting challenges faced by the people he encounters.

It has been said that the newest Rupole of the Bailey on offer is substandard in audio.  This version I found had slight audio challenges at times.  For the most part this version of the Rumpole of the Bailey is understandable if you set your TV sound up correctly.  I found this a fun and interesting Rumpole Series Set that while not absolutely perfect was perfectly adequate in video and audio quality.  For sure this complete Rumpole series is superior to the new version on offer if the new Rupole Series reviews are to be believed.",1420416000,2,2780,4.530120481927711

Rumpole of the Bailey, staring Leo McKern and written by Sir John Mortimer, is a very enjoyable series of shows. You will love watching every one of the 42 episodes. Horace Rumpole is the essence of being ""an Old Bailey Hack"". He loves being in court exchanging banter with a red judge. It's all seems easy going until you realize that Rumpole is deadly serious and is only happy when he succeeds in getting a ""Not Guilty"" ruling from the jury of twelve, tried and true members. Horace Rumpole does not agree that being on trial implies guilt; it is the prosecutions job to prove, using factual arguments and evidence, that the accused is guilty beyond all reasonable doubt. He enjoys nothing more than skillful cross examination.  He is a staunch believer in the presumption of innocence and the ""Golden Thread of British Justice. Rumpole is very proud of his success as a junior in the Penge Bungalow Murders case where he put on the defense as a white wig, alone and without a leader.

In chambers the bright and witty barrister Horace Rumpole, who often includes fragments of poetry from Arthur Quiller-Couch's Oxford Book of English Verse, or William Wordsworth, in his conversations enjoys friendly interchanges with other chambers members: Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) a Q.C. (Queen's Counsel), and later a Red Judge, Samuel Ballard (Peter Blythe), Rumpole refers to him in private as ""Soapy Sam"", was head of chambers in several episodes. Claude Erskine-Browne (Julian Curry), an opera buff with a preference for Wagner, who eventually became a Q.C. amid comments of ""They must be handing out silk gowns with pounds of tea nowadays!"" and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge) called ""Portia"" in chambers, were finally married after starting their family ahead of going to the alter. Portia later became a Q. C., a Recorder, and then a Judge. Fiona Allways (Rosalyn Landor) and Miz Liz Probert (Samantha Bond) were the new young stars in chambers. Dave Inchcape (Michael Grandage) added a new promising young man, who later had a stormy and occasionally romantic relationship with Miz Liz. Rumpole referred to him as the Inchcape Rock. Ballard brought Charles Hearthstoke: (Nicholas Gecks) in to reorganize and streamline the clerk's office. Rumpole called him ""Hearthrug"". The role of Rumpole's wife Hilda, ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"", was played in early episodes by Peggy Thorpe-Bates and later by Marion Mathie.

Almost Every day Rumpole walked over to ""Pommeroy's"" wine bar on Fleet Street, which is also within walking distance of the Old Bailey. There he could order glasses of his favorite red wine, ""Pommeroy's Plonk"" or ""Chateau Thames Embankment"" on the slate. He could also have a chat with other members of chambers: Portia's husband Erskine-Brown or perhaps chamber's clerk, Henry Trench (Jonathan Coy). Henry was efficient, unhappily married, and an amateur dramatics enthusiast, frequently appearing in works by Nol Coward.

Such is the everyday environment of The Old Bailey Hack, Rumpole of the Bailey. I can't recommend him more heartily. Treat yourself and your family to many happy evenings reveling in Rumpole's life at chambers and his days at the Old Bailey sparing with the lovely old judges.",1391904000,2,3233,5.092452830188679

And that lawyer had flown in from Pennsylvania!  That's a tribute to the universal appeal of this comedy if ever it needed a testimonial",1379462400,3,1059,4.531578947368421

Rumpole using logic and truth defends his clients with all the wit and cunning of a master chess player.

22083,5,0767088247,"When this series was first show, I was either too young to watch it, in the 70's or thought the subject matter too boring in the 1980's and I was out the country in the 1990's. I first saw a full episode of this charming programme on ITV 3 in 2008. The episode was from series 4 and I automatically fell in love with the characters from that episode. When the price of this DVD set came down I bought it and have not regretted the purchase.

I trained to be a Barrister, although I went into teaching EU law at American and Russian Universities. Many of the comical moments are so true to life and it this realism that makes virtually all 7 series so magical.

John Mortimer, who I once met at Foyles Book Shop in London, was a genius. He was an experienced Barrister and used this vast experience to write characters and Court Room cases that are so true to life. Series 1 and 2 are focused on the law and the legal process. Rumpole is portrayed by Leo McKern to be more legalistic and less comical than in series 3 to 7. I personally think series 4 is perfection with absolutely the right balance between comedy and legal drama. The development by Bill Fraser of the ""Mad Bull"" was genius to Rumpole's anti establishment character.

There are a handful of weak episodes, mainly from series 6 and 7. I suppose after writing so many episodes the ideas began to dry up.

Everyone can learn and enjoy something from Rumpole. It is one of the BEST TV series ever made and at 17 for 7 series of 6 episodes its a bargain. I would also highly recommend any student of the Bar, to watch this series as you can learn so much about how the legal process works.

22143,5,0767088247,"First off two things should be cleared up. the item discription sates that this series is based of a series of books. In point of fact it is the other way around. the tv series came first and the books after. the stories and books were based off the episodes. sometimes Mortimer would write up the story after the episode or series appeared. so the tv series came first.
Secondly this set is not entirely 'complete'. oh yes it has all 7 series and the tv movie. however for true Rumpole fans I would recomend finding what it titled Rupole 'the Lost episode'. In point of fact this 'lost episode' is the Pilot for this series. (you may in fact see the dvd for it on this page.

All that being said. This is probably my favorite legal based show. Leo McKern excels as Rumpole. now again yes there are the stories and radios plays. but as McKern came first i still think of him as the origninal. the only Rumpole worth note. Rumpole is the selfproclaimed 'Old Baily Hack' who defends a wide assortment of clients. he never prosecutes, he never pleads guilty. he quotes Wordsworth, smokes small cigars, and he will never 'take silk' (ie become a judge.) He lives under the strict rule of ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"" ie his wife Hilda. His son Nick lives in America, the true 'brains of the family'. he resides at Number 3 Equity court. along side him are many other companions. George Frobisher, 'Uncle Tom', Phyllida Trant (the Portia of Chambers), the erstwhile Claud Eresken-Brown, and others. yet neither his house nor his chambers is his true home. his true home is the Old Baily. it is where he truely feels alive. yet even here he must face an array of tiresome judges. men such as Judge Bullingham 'The Mad Bull', Justice Graves, Justice Oliver Oliphant, and others. still Rumpole carries on in his own fashion.

Rumpole (McKern) is the highlight of the show. his wit, his personality. all of it is a pure joy to watch. these episodes are half mystery and half court room drama. at times the truth comes out, and Rumpole is able to pierce the vail and find the truth. two full seasons occur before Rumpole is persuaded to retire. but then come the tv movie. Rumpole's Return. where even he can not stay on vacation for long. the lure of the Old Baily calls and he is back in action again. then we return for five more series in all. all in all it is a delight to watch. I can not overstate just how well McKern does in this series. it is a joy to watch.

so i would highly recomend this to any who is a fan of witty legal/mystery shows and wish to see a true pro in action. highly recomended.",1354233600,2,2593,4.386694386694387

22155,5,0767088247,"Waited / thought / waited longer / read reviews / waited even longer. What was I thinking!! This series is amazing.

John Mortimer introduces each segment with ""Opening Remarks"" - wow, presented by the writer as his perspective on his own character. Rumpole starts out very confusing to the unprepared viewer, but then with perserverance and attention, you adapt and understand Rumpole talking to himself / Rumpole talking in court / Rumpole talking to his wife / Rumpole talking in Chambers / Rumpole quoting Wordsworth / and just plain, but not-so-plain Rumpole.

This series is the anthesis of US television today. There is no homogenious, mind-numbing script or acting that often frequents US television. You can not sit back with half your attention and expect to enjoy - at that level it will only confuse and frustrate. It takes your full attention as John Mortimer sneaks in short phrases and/or concepts that open up to incredible ideas and concepts. And all takes place in the 1970s - so the UK was suffering from similar cultural pains as the US - who would have guessed, except historians!

One reviewer had preferred Garrow's Law over Rumpole which was countered by another reviewer who supported Rumpole as the very best. I believe that each have their own genre and are not comparative but should be appreciated on their own individual merit.

Rumpole of the Bailey is a treasure - in the US, this would have been groundbreaking in terms of cultural significance / complexity of scripting / quality of cast perfomances / etc. Sadly, US television (not premium networks) frequently fails to ask the audience to reach, think, process, or be challenged. Rumpole does all this and more. Albeit, the every present alcohol consumption gets to be a bit much, but that was/is also British culture - so I got over it.

The inimitable wry humor and intelligence of Rumpole ages well. Brits place real people, with shapes, wrinkles, character, and rumples in front of the camera. So get through the first, slow-moving episode, and then settle down for a delicious experience with the irascible Rumpole. With each successive story, the narrative develops and thickens like Rumpole's brown sauce, while picture and sound quality improves. John Mortimer's introductions are inimitable, though one may take exception to the ghoulish glee when he recounts blood-stains in ""Rumpole and the Heavy Brigade,"" Disk 2; this doesn't detract from the overall excellence. Even the minefields of race and culture conflict are elegantly handled, showing the presumptuousness of assuming all minorities share the same beliefs; deftly done! You'd better have plenty of victuals on hand; the Brain of Rumpole requires much sustenance to maintain girth and mirth and insight.

To add to my pleasure in viewing the series, I first read some of the original stories by John Mortimer in ""The First Rumpole Omnibus."" Not only are the scripts filled with humor, but there is a subtle message as well. The star of the series, Leo McKern, is the ideal Rumpole.",1314230400,,438,4.226190476190476
22176,5,0767088247,"Rumpole has been a much loved character for many years now.  He is famous - he was even mentioned during the O.J. Simpson trial!  This is a wonderful collection and extremely good value.  It is not only funny, it is witty - there is a difference.  Rumpole is a wonderful character who is brilliantly presented to us by Leo MacKern - a great character actor.  The whole cast are on form and complement Rumpole well.

It is fascinating to see the British legal system 'up close' - for those that enjoy this, check out BBC America's wonderful 'LAW AND ORDER U.K.' - believe it or not, it is even better than the original version.

John Mortimer's wonderful 'scene setting snippets' are a delight - it is amusing to see that he often has a glass of 'Chateau Pomeroy's' before him.

In this day and age of 'bang-bang, car chases and loud sirens', it is such a delight to see the 'once real world' where things progressed at a leisurely pass and where villians has a certain class and 'honesty' about them.  The stories hold the interest and are often filled with pathos.

The wonderful thing about this set is that the individual episodes can be enjoyed again and again.

attuned to the British accent and the pace of conversation. Rumpole displays
an understanding of human nature both of those he defends as well as coworkers in ""Chambers"". He is a scruffy old curmudgeon but can see through facades and zero in on the crux of the situation. He holds to high standards in his work and his personal life. This series kept my attention and provided hours of entertainment.

The writer (John Mortimer) pulls from his own personal experiences as a British Barrister to bring interesting legal cases to life. Interesting too, is the fact these stories were written and produced over several years; meaning social changes, mores', and fashions are depicted.

When I popped this into my DVD player I was hoping for a decent transfer but it looks like a pirated dvd the nice third world lady comes to all the local stores with.

True, there are no subtitles; but the dialogue and sound is of much better quality than suggested by the few people who complained about sound on this set. Yes, the characters are very British and there are British accents; what do you expect from a British TV show? Rumpole is a fine a series and a lot of fun to watch. We turn up the volume on our TV just slightly higher than normal, and everything is fine. The plots are easy to follow...IF you pay attention; and if you desire to leave behind the nonsense reality shows endlessly plastered all over TV; and truly desire to enjoy some storytelling. There are some great actors on this series, Leo McKern as Rumpole; David Yelland (Poirot's butler George); Marion Mathie (as ""she who must be obeyed""); and many other fine actors.

First of all there are no subtitles.  This is a problem because the sound quality/transfer is mediocre, and thus it's difficult to tell what is being said: there's a lot of dialogue that's spoken in heavily-accented English with regional dialects, so for an American it's hard to keep track of the story. (Presumably I was better able to watch it 35 years ago due to better sound quality on PBS, and my hearing was a lot better).

The picture quality is also not very good; this was obviously a cheap video transfer effort, so the visuals look washed-out to me.

Having only ended up watching one episode, I'm now saddled with the entire DVD set that no one else around me is interested in even watching, much less buying from me.",1294272000,69,970,4.494318181818182

22214,4,0767088247,"Rumpole of the Bailey is a wonderful show that tackled issues and showed characters in ways that rarely American television would.

As much as I adore Perry Mason, and I do, I appreciate that Rumpole actually LOSES.  And sometimes, he regrets winning.

Leo McKern was amazing as Rumpole.  He played a brilliant courtroom attorney, but was so miserable in his personal life.  The secondary characters seem utterly human, flawed, but yet interesting.

Issues are dealt with incredibly early in the show, such as not to follow in you father's footsteps, or the nature of affairs, or underage sex (and I did not see that plotline developing).

The quality of the shows does go down a bit in the middle of the run.  The characterization of the female characters is uneven - often what they do does not make sense based on how they are developed earlier.  I really miss the first Mrs. Rumpole, after she leaves for health reasons.

As I'm hard of hearing, I really wish it had subtitles.  I have a hard time with a familiar accent, so the British version is hard for me at times.

Get it for certain, if you like quality TV.",1292630400,16,1118,4.590909090909091

22216,5,0767088247,"Rumpole fun. As English as Midsomer Murders. Crime after DCI Barnaby does the investigation? Rumpole is on the level of that other series. The Rumpole character made the career of the writer (John Mortimer, now deceased, died Jan.'09.) ""Rumpole of The Bailey"", a lasting 7-year TV series still gains new fans. A book, ""A Rumpole Christmas"" is a perfect companion to any Rumpole collection, even DVDs.

Rumpole episodes (42) are much more than court proceedings. It is mystery in revelations of events that led to the trials of criminals. It is also quite humorous. Touching moments, LOL moments, suspense, and quirky characters all blended so magnificently into the mysterious. Leo McKern is Rumpole...IS fantastically Rumpole. Cast is superb.

Each story is great in itself. They blend the courtroom drama and eclectic court characters with Horace Rumpole's investigative techniques even as he attempts to defend those who sometimes are the guilty, or at least appear so. He fights for the little guys, and his wife, Hilda (known to Rumpole as She Who Must Be Obeyed) keeps him cornered on the home front. You will get hooked on this lovable barrister (courtroom defender) who to the criminally retched is a sort of Robin Hood of The Bailey (criminal court). It takes a bit of time to understand the difference of legal terms, like barrister and solicitor, but you'll get it.

Rumpole is to the UK courtroom what DCI Barnaby is to crime investigation in ""Midsomer Murders"". Both bloody good fun dealing with the mystery and criminal element. Do the math, cost divided by episodes. This is one crime-comedy-caper-filled set you'll laugh through and all the way to the bank with your savings. Better; and only a tenth the cost of driving to a theater presentation.

Go ahead and put some fun in your courtroom experiences. Rumpole style is well worth it. You will be glad you purchased. After the Rumpole of The Bailey experience, if you've not had enough of British mystery and crime, I highly recommend ANY set of  ""Midsomer Murders."" Nobody does mystery like the Brits. They put the jolly good FUN in criminal conFrUNtation.",1291075200,29,2126,4.977464788732394

It is, quite simply, one of the most engaging, funny, and (hold your nose, now) educational series ever seen on television.  First, there is Leo McKern, one of the few personalities that I desperately wish I could have met before he died.  (The two others I can think of right off are Burt Lancaster and Lord Kenneth Clark.)  He has breathed life into John Mortimer's Rumpole such that, when you watch any of these extraordinarily crafted episodes, disbelief is totally suspended.  Furthermore, the supporting cast (changed slightly over the run of the series) is as right as rain.  Characters are finely drawn and totally human.  Even if they are occasionally over the top, there is never any harm done, and, if anything, you take them in all the more.  This series is not merely a frolic or an escape--it is your companion.  To pass up acquiring this set is as if you are turning down a license to steal.  John Mortimer's Rumpole is so fully dimensional that, if even his roughest edges annoy you, the fault is yours, not his.

Leo McKern is a perfect fit for the role of Horace Rumpole, a character who enjoys a glass of claret at Pomeroy's, spouts poetry, has an uncanny insight into human nature, and values justice above upward mobility.  For the puzzle solver, mysteries abound ranging from the disappearance of the nail brush from the men's room at the Old Bailey to the high crimes of the courtroom.  Through the often comic personalities, the series offers an entertaining look at human strengths and weaknesses with a greater nod to truth than to reality.

22234,5,0767088247,"I first encountered the fascinating Rumpole Series quite by accident---my own lawyer, Otto, was a huge fan when the series played on PBS originally in the 1980s.  He got me started on it. While I did enjoy the occassional episode I saw while visiting him at his home, I confess I never really understood the show all that much. You know, British law---it seems a bit odd to an American, I admit. And I swear, if you blink or step out for a snack--you will miss quite a bit of what's going on.  So, do try to focus when watching, it really helps with the show's subtleties and distinctive British colloquialisms. But I now know what I was missing: simply the best written and performed legal drama of the last century---bar none. Not even the late, great Charles Laughton, in--Witness for the Prosecution--could hold a candle to Leo McKern when he's on one of his thunderous rolls before the bench of justice.

Now the deal you get here for your money is actually a good one: All the original episodes--but one--the Lost Episode--is included. And while I think the quality of the production was fairly good for the period---please remember we're talking British Television of some 20-30 years ago---it was a taped show...Thank God for the digital revolution.....Just think: those original tapes might have mouldered away by now if they hadn't been digitized and preserved.

The scripts and plots do appear as relevant today as they ever were. There may be mild language issues and a bit of tasteful nudity included which might offend some households--but you know who you are.

Horace Rumpole is a truly original character and John Mortimer was an extremely clever writer who appears to have cooked up the perfect role for Leo McKern. He's an old avuncular kind of guy who has lent enormous dignity to every role he's played.

While I might criticize the lack of foreign language options--it's english or nothing, folks--but to me, the deal is still a good one. The boxed set is attractive enough on a shelf. The disks were totally without defects and play well enough. The cast is first rate--Patricia Hodge, Peter Bowles, and Jonathan Coy all shine in their performances as well. And Abigail McKern--Leo's own daughter, also acquits herself nicely a bit later in the show as Rumpole's feisty and formidable junior lawyer. All in all, it was a wonderful assemblege of talent that had rare chemistry on the T.V. screen. John Mortimer, the author, was gracious enough to introduce each episode with a brief outline where he offers a few charming insights into the filming of the show.

But I have to tell you it's gratifying simply to have such a large body of Leo Mckern's work available at all. You know, I've looked for copies of some of his early work---for example, his first starring film role---Travelling North--without much success--unless you care for VHS cassettes. Leo seemed to prefer the stage to Television or even movies....His film work almost exclusively casts him in much smaller, though important supporting roles. The Shoes of the Fisherman being my favorite although he also did a very poigniant documentary on the Battle of the Somme--in 1976--if you care to catch a glimpse of old Leo without his stock makeup.

 But it is a remarkably short series--sadly, only 44 episodes....Fact is, if you had a chance to see Leo Mckern live onstage, you can count yourself blessed. Because much of his best work apparently was unrecorded as it was in live theater productions--so all we have is the choice bits of film work that he did consent to perform with which to remember the man by.

Not that he didn't perform his few film roles flawlessly, it's just that you'd think Hollywood would have taken adavantage of his potential a bit more than they did. And let's not forget this is a man who suffered from terrible stagefright. It's a wonder he ever went into the profession---given that he was scaring and stressing himself half to death--while delighting his fans---with each and every performance.

So, here's to you, Leo. We clearly took you for granted for far too many years....We all regret that now, I assure you. But we thoroughly enjoyed every minute of your onscreen performances whenever you did manage to pop up....

And you will be sorely missed, you dear old Bailey Hack. But thanks, at least,
for leaving us this smigeon of great performance art to remember you by. I would recommend this collection as a gift to anyone who cherishes short, fat, balding, cigar-chomping men who so audaciously and eloquently defend the rights of common people everywhere--armed only with their wits, a crumpled hat, and their ever trusty umbrella.

Will there ever be another actor like Leo Mckern?  Not likely, old darlings. Not in our lifetimes....Which in my view is reason enough to add this unique series to your own fine film collection.",1280448000,4,4856,4.849033816425121
22235,3,0767088247,"Rumpole of the Bailey is a bargain for the large number of episodes in the set. It is not a mystery, but a look at the workings of the British every day legal/court system as it follows Rumpole from his house and overbearing wife; to the office; meeting clients; to the pub; and to the court room. Rumpole is very chatty, forcefully so to the point of being a bit annoying. We are supposed to love him, but I think Leo McKern was acting his part like a stage play rather than the restrain of a movie role. As a crusty older and wiser character, he is not nearly as lovebale as Det Frost. On the other hand, the cases are very realistic, full of human frailities and this aspect draws the viewer onward for more Rumpole.",1279843200,6,719,4.255474452554744

22253,5,0767088247,"At the time I'm writing this, this series is available for an amazingly low cost (C.$35), which is less than a third of what I paid for it in separate boxes. If you love British mysteries and love British character actors, you absolutely have to own Rumpole. These are all thoughtful, insightful, funny and wonderful shows--following the cozy legal adventures of a dumpy, homely, eccentric barrister who doggedly fights for the little guy. Rumpole never prosecutes, only defends. Surrounding him is bevy of equally eccentric supporting characters. Leo McKern (best known for The Prisoner and the Beatles' 2nd flick Help!) is brilliant as Horace Rumpole, the Wordsworth-spouting barrister. It's a joy to see him grow older as he takes the character from middle-age to near-retirement. I almost cried the day I heard that McKern died. For sure, no more Rumpole. I almost felt the same way when Rumpole's creator John Mortimer (dad of Emily Mortimer) died. But we have these 40 or so shows spanning a decade and a half. And that's a gift.

22255,4,0767088247,"I remember watching many episodes of the Rumpole series on public TV years ago and thoroughly enjoyed the performances and character development.  It was not your ordinary crime/courtroom drama nor comedy.  It was a truly delightful mix of the two personified in the performance of Leo McKern in the title role.  He is the epitome of  Horace Rumpole of the John Mortimer stories just as Jeremy Brett is the epitome of Sherlock Holmes of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories.

In purchasing the Complete Series Megaset I wanted to be able to watch the series from the very beginning (something I was unable to do years ago).  I was not disappointed since the series did indeed build upon itself and develop its characters and story lines which I'd missed earlier.

The sound quality leaves a little to be desired and it still takes my ears a little while to adjust to the British accent however, that's where a DVD is so useful ... I can just ""rewind"" a little and pick it up again.

Regular network TV programming and even cable/satellite programming many times reminds me of that lyric-line from a Bruce Springsteen song ""57 channels and nothing on"".  Having DVD versions of quality programming like ""Rumpole"" gives me a welcome escape from bad drama, sitcoms, and reality television.",1265932800,,1279,4.830275229357798

22257,5,0767088247,"I can't say enough good things about the Rumpole series. Rumpole is a hilarious, yet also slightly sad character, quirky and not in the least concerned with what other people think.  He's himself, and there is no one else like him.  Even when you don't agree with him, you like him and you find him fascinating.  I can't stand his cigars and cigar smoke all over the place for instance.  He drops ashes everywhere, too. But I forgive him because he is SO intelligent, full of biting wit, and a man of ethics and character.

Leo McKern, who plays Rumpole, is one of the best actors I have ever come across. The rest of the cast is also outstanding, many of them playing characters who are unintentionally funny.

The series also pokes fun at the British legal system and the various personality and ego types that are drawn to work in it. Another thing I like: Rumpole does not always win, and his client is not always innocent even when he does win. Lots of irony and pathos in these episodes. Enjoy.",1265414400,,1000,4.467032967032967

I'd recommend this series to anybody who likes their comedy a little more cerebral, a little gentler and freer from foul language than anything else on offer.

22259,4,0767088247,"I remember watching this series on PBS years ago and really enjoying it, and I enjoyed seeing it again.

It's particularly enjoyable to watch the whole series and see how the characters developed.  Leo McKern griped to people toward the end of his life that the only role he would be remembered for would be Rumpole, but it was his own fault.  When an actor takes a character, makes it his own, and almost becomes it, then he has nobody except himself to blame.

There are some drawbacks though.  As some others have mentioned, the audio is inconsistent.  You constantly find yourself turning the sound up and down so you can hear the dialog.

Another drawback are the ""Opening remarks"" by John Mortimer tacked on to the beginning of each episode.  He's more than difficult to understand.  And, unlike some other DVD collections, the menu doesn't offer a selection that allows you to skip the opening credits and jump directly to the program.

As far as the stories are concerned- they are like most others.  Some will keep you guessing until the very end and some others are given away seconds after the title appears.",1263427200,6,1119,4.687179487179487
22270,5,0767088247,"Though that observation might seem self-contradictory, there's truth in it. Like Arthur Conan-Doyle, John Mortimer is less interested in the crime itself than what is going on /around/ the crime. However much fun it is to see Rumpole untangle the evidence and expose the true criminal, Mortimer is much more interested in the legal profession and the people who inhabit it -- most of whom lack Rumpole's integrity, and seem to be in it simply because of the status it brings. ""Rumpole of the Bailey"" is a comedy of manners about the law.

Mortimer portrays most of the legal profession as not only self-involved to the point where it affects their interpretation of the law, but as insufferably ignorant and stupid. Rumpole constantly quotes poets, and one can understand that not every line he spouts will be recognized, but when supposedly educated people don't recognize ""Macbeth"" -- or Rumpole's wife doesn't know the meaning of the word ""compel"" -- one can see what Mortimer thinks of the general intelligence of the English.

As someone who's dabbled in fiction, hearing Mortimer's clever dialog is depressing -- how could I ever write that well? Of course, Mortimer was helped by not having the turn out more than six episodes per season, giving him plenty of time to polish his work.

Watching these episodes is addictive. Unreservedly recommended.

PS: I should note that I purchased the megaset several weeks ago -- from Amazon -- when the price was half what it's currently going for. It might never come back to that price, but perhaps you should wait.",1262476800,,1564,4.912878787878788

A little drama and it is finally wrapped up in short order. More than the stories that do not leave you hanging it are the comments that make the episode interesting to watch.

And then there is Rumpole himself who drinks too much, eats too much and smokes too much.  When I first began the series I thought Rumpole to be a grumpy old man and I had to laugh the first time I saw John Mortimer with his huge Adam Ant glasses.  But as I watched more I went from laughing at Rumpole and Mr. Mortimer, to laughing with them, to enjoying their company and finally to becoming friends.  The stories are very well written and Leo McKern is a perfect Rumpole of the Bailey.  I may not want to become like Rumpole or encourage my son to use him as a role model, but I would like to have him as my friend.  By the end of the show you have a warm feeling for Rumpole and his creator and you have many fond memories.  At first I questioned the high marks that others were awarding this show but now I echo them.  If I knew Shakespeare better I would give an appropriate quote to summarize this review, but as it is, I will leave that to my friend Rumpole.",1253145600,3,1229,4.244635193133047

This is also a fascinating look behind the British Legal system, its politics and history, wonderfully written by John Mortimer, who was a barrister himself.

22275,5,0767088247,"Horace Rumpole is a figure to set along side Sherlock Holmes and Robin Hood in the pantheon of great British creations. Is it drama? Is it comedy? It is both and along side the great man are a host of entertaining supporting figures such as Hilda Rumpole (She who must be obeyed), Claude Erskine Brown, Judge Bullingham (The Bull), Philippa Erskine Brown (The Porta of Chambers), Uncle Tom (who having no legal work plays golf in the office) Soapey Sam Ballard and Gutherie Featherstone, as well as various members of the criminal Timson family. Above all there is Horace Rumpole lover of the fried English breakfast, steak and kidney pudding, spotted dick, cheap claret, small cigars and poetry. It is an articule of faith that his clients never plead guilty and that Horace, who as it is pionted out knows nothing about the law, can sway a jury. Sadly Horace does not always win even when his clients are innocent. The stories are good and set in an England that no longer exists indeed never existed in the first place, that is to say an England of ecentric lawyers and lovable criminals. However the real reason to watch this series is to see Horace Rumploe played by the late great Leo McKern, with cigar ash down his waistcoat, making a fool of the most pompous of judges. So good is McKern's performance in playing this most English of figures you forget that Leo McKern was in fact an Australian.

Rumpole disdains ordinary civil cases and prefers to represent persons accused of crimes, in the Old Bailey courthouse in London, England.  To help his clients, he uses his considerable skills in cross-examination, as well as his intellect, street wisdom and love of poetry.  The series brings to light some truly memorable characters in a humorous way, and gives us a great introduction to the life of an English Barrister. (Mortimer was a barrister himself.)  You will delight in the interaction of the regulars on the show, including Rumpole's wife, ""she who must be obeyed,"" played by Peggy Thorpe-Bates.

When you watch these episodes, look for something that is happening in Rumpole's professional life that also resonates in his own personal/family life. (Mortimer embeds a resonance in each episode, to bring out themes that have a truly universal appeal.)

  In a nutshell, it's difficult to put a price on fine entertainment, but both my wife (for whom ""Rumpole of the Bailey - The complete Series"" was purchased as a Christmas present) and I agree that the $52.86 that was spent on this series provided us with more pleasure than any number of dinners out.

  The only minus I will mention first.  We were not too pleased with the ""Opening Remarks"" (by Author John Mortimer) format of each episode.  It was a little depressing to watch this old gent, who appeared to be in a very fragile and debilitated state ( and in fact, he did pass away just recently).  I would have preferred to conjure up a more pleasant image of the author, as I have, for example, of one of his contemporaries whose works enjoy a similar literary prestige, viz. P. G. Wodehouse.

  Now for the pluses - which far outweigh that one minus.  It's easier to list them than to try to frame them in narrative form.

  1) Believability of characters - Rumpole himself and his entire
  supporing cast.  Totally credible.

  2) Rumpole's ambivalence of character - ranging from a mature
  knowledgeable barrister defending a common criminal with eloquence
  to a rather unpredictable wine-sop who sometimes acts quite
  undignified and undecorously.

  3) A superb blending of dry humor and outright pathos.

  4) Rumpole's very apt utilization of famous quotations in varied
  situations.

  5) The ability to bring real feelings and philosophical profundity
  into the most common of unfortunate situations.

22317,5,0767088247,"This television series enjoyed a long on again off again life for Thames Television and the USA in the PBS Mystery Series.
 The essence of this highly interesting Series is the character of Horace Rumpole an aging barrister who defends clients from petty thieves to murderers.
 The scripts written by John Mortimer emphasizes Rampole's reverence for English law which he adheres to the basic principal of innocence until proven guilty.  Although Rumpole is considered a legend at the Bailey, he's not the Perry Mason who wins every trial.  Rather we see a Rumpole who is very human and subject to the temptations and bad habits known to us all.  However Rumpole is indeed wise, intelligent and a compassionate man.
 Rumpole is guided in his family life by the indomitable Hilda Rumpole.  Hilda keeps Rumpole on the straight and narrow.  Remember it is She who must be obeyed!  Her expectations for Rumpole at his advanced age is to be a Circuit Judge or a QC.  In reality Rumpole wants none of that!  What he does want is to win a scrape at the old Bailey.  This constant interaction between Hilda and Rumpole makes for the basic essence of the entire story that Mr. Mortimer is trying to convey.
 Mortimer intertwines recurrent characters throughout the 44 episodes over the span of 13 years.  Such characters as Justice Roger Billingham (The Mad Bull), Justice Vosper, Justice Gerald Graves, Dodo MacKontosh and my absolute favorite Fig (Soaking Wet) Newton all bring predictable scenarios and comic relief.
 In all of the Rumpole episodes we get the sense of purpose and duty of what Rumpole is trying to do.  He wants no titles or honors.  What is important to him is that justice is indeed served.  He is an educated man who does deserve the qualification such as QC in his title.  In retrospect what Horace really wants is the title of the true defender of the common man.
 Each on these episodes are written to entertain and educate the people in English law.  In each episode Rumpole will lead us into scenarios that are different and quite unorthodox.  You have no idea where the story will lead.
 Leo McKern portrays this rather simple barrister with a complicated demeanor as no one else can.  Another excellent British Series which I say deserves 5 Stars!",1226620800,3,2267,4.783505154639175

22360,5,0767088247,"One of the all-time great British series and one of the best ever courtroom series is Rumpole of the Bailey. These films are wonderful productions full of interesting characters, humorous situations and compelling stories. If you like the John Mortimer books--and if you haven't read any, you should immediately--you will greatly enjoy all of the films. Each episode is introduced by Mortimer, who gives us plenty of insight into how the particular story came to be. The late Leo McKern came to embody Rumpole; it's impossible to even imagine another actor who could begin to approach McKern in the role.

One could go on and on about what it is that makes Rumpole the person so endearing: his irascibility, his patience with his high-strung, somewhat shrewish wife Hilda--the legendary She Who Must Be Obeyed, and at the same time his scathingly rebellious retorts in response to her demands (always mumbled under his breath, of course), his impatience with the stuffed shirts he must deal with each day (many of whom are justices), his courtroom cunning, his equanimity, his constant mutterings, oaths, and soliloquies, frequently coming up with a few lines of his beloved Wordsworth to suit the particular occasion, his affection for ""Chateau de Thames Embankment"" (a cheap ""plonk"" or table wine served at his favorite pub, Pomeroy's, conveniently located near the Old Bailey), his cheap cigars, his rumpled old hat, his dedication to his profession, his affection for the many cheap crooks and artful dodgers he defends, and his absolute and total abhorrence of the guilty plea.

Surrounded by snobs and status-seeking social climbers, Rumpole is completely and totally without pretense. He'd much rather rub worn elbows with shady, blue-collar criminals than the haughty, monied upper classes.
Hilda, bless her heart, keeps pushing and prodding Horace, hoping he will someday ""take silk"" or perhaps become a justice, but Horace can't see himself as anything other than an ""Old Bailey Hack"".

But there is a fabulous collection of supporting characters here as well: Guthrie Featherstone, the pompous and vain former head of chambers who has now reached his ultimate goal: judgeship. Guthrie, who is greatly relishing the prestige of his position, sees himself as a Solomon-like figure, but is treated like an errant child by his domineering wife Marigold. Claude Erskine-Brown is married to Philida, who's shamed Claude by reaching QC (Queen's Council) before him; Claude is a special target for darts from Rumpole, but the opera-loving, philandering Claude is usually so preoccupied and full of himself that he misses Rumpoles' skewerings. Soapy Sam Ballard is the new Head of Chambers, and it's difficult to determine which of the two--Sam or Claude--is the biggest ninny. There are many, many other rich and vibrant characters haunting the rooms of Equity Court.

With this set of DVDs we are now being introduced to Rumpole ""from the beginning"" with just a few recognizable faces in the cast and a decidedly different relationship between Rumpole and Hilda.  Rumpole is ever clever and obstinate, ruffling the feathers of judges (especially Featherstone), appearing to be on the wrong side of the case, then amazing us all with his insight into the case and wisdom for humanity.  It's wonderful to find a new generation of Rumpole, the younger man, then watch as he ages into the more familiar.",1200009600,2,634,4.693693693693693

22401,5,0767088247,"I can not say enough how much I not just loved but adored this series.  I always liked Rumpole but, it first came on PBS while I was still young so I did not see most of the awesome subplots going on in Chambers.  I love Rumpole because while it has sex, limited violence some rare frontal female nudity and so much more none of it is ever done in purely vulgar bad taste.

Its not all about Rumpole even if he is the star.  His fellowed learned gentlemen baristers in Chambers are all equally vivid odd characters in their own right.  Number 3 Equity Court is a place alive with all manner of intriques.  Its not Law and Order or The Practice but in its own way many weighty legal elements are thoughtfully explored.

There is a thread of wry humor running throughout the series.  I suspect the deep love and affection between man and wife has never been more realistically portrayed on TV in my opinion than when Rumpole's relationship with She Who Must Be Obeyed, Hilda Rumpole steps in scene.  I lovef that Hilda was not a gushing fool or empty headed.  Hilda was a strong often severe woman who dearly loved and supported her husband Horrace Rumpole but was clever enough to never let him take her love for granted.  Hilda was one smart sista who could have been a great barister in her own right but she opted to be the power behind a great man and that she was and more.

Horace Rumpole was what we in the United States would call a Public Defender, the lawyer you get by default if you enter the criminal legal system without means to pay for a private criminal law attorney.  Rumpole had a passion for the job of defending his criminal clients and had a great record of getting them off scott free.  The judges were all larger than life old darlings who seemed to enjoy tossing people into the nick. (prison).

The British legal system while sort of like ours in the United States it is quite different in how things are done.  If you plan to enjoy everything in Rumpole it is best to raed up on british courts and the way law is practiced.  Really you only need to know a few things.  A solicitor in British Law is like a basic laywer om the USA.  The Solicitor gathers the basic facts of the case and prepares a basic plan of attack in proving the innocence of person in the dock.  A barrister is a lawyer with special standing that allows him \ her to actually work in conjunction with the Judge and the solicitor to a just end.  thats how things are supposed to work in theory but Judges tend to be convervative hence they get the prosecution a wee bit of help only just.

Judges are called ""Your Lordship or Your Ladyship"".  In Rumpole you will hear a lot of talk about QC's Queens Council's or as Rumpole calls them Queer Customers.  QC's are sort of like super Barasters who sort of have the queens blessing to do her business in the name of justic in British Courts.  The Old Bailey refers to the Old Central London Courts Complex with its old gray building and distinctive high domed roof located on Baliey Street hence its name.  The old Bill are slang terms for Police Officers.

The DVD sort of helps you understand each episode and the odd aspects of British law if you listen to the authors set up segments that come before each program starts.  Rumpole is in a class by himself, for this is light comedy, drama, legal theme show and commentary all in one.  I would suggest that you buy the Rumpole play on a seperate DVD that inspired the Rumpole series.  Also another must BUY is the following book: Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders.  This was indeed Horace Rumpoles first finist hour when he proved his client not guilty of capital murder of two war heros one his own dad.  Rumpole was but a junior white wig barrister with hardly a year of real life law experience under his belt at the time.  It was during these heady times that he fell into the loving embrace of his soon to be good lady wife Hilda.  Rumpole did hardly realized he had fell into Hilda's web but Hild a strong willed woman who once saw what she wanted she was not stopped.  Hilda felt she could make something of her Rumpole and she did.  Rumpole never became a QC or a circut (circus judge) but he stood for the best in law that all should be represented in court by an aggressive barrister who believed in their clients innocence.  Rumpole a self described old Baliey hack was a soldier in the army of good that gives to all acused a fair chance before the law.

I enjoyed Rumpole and if you buy the whole set you will also enjoy Horrace Rumpole anytime you want.",1185580800,3,4567,4.348288075560803
22402,4,0767088247,"The first couple of disks provide an episode for each year.

When I saw that I could purchase the entire series for some 40% off, I couldn't pass it up and I'm very glad I didn't.  If you are an anglophile, or even not an anglophile, but are tired of the barrage of mindless mediocrity in entertainment that surrounds us, then treat yourself to hours of truly intelligent, wry, witty and sometimes poignant entertainment.

22409,5,0767088247,"'Rumpole of the Bailey' is one of my favourite book series, and is also one of my favourite television series of all time. Spanning well over a decade, Thames television produced over 40 episodes of the crusty old barrister's tales, penned both for book and screen by John Mortimer, who used to take delight in highlighting silliness in judicial judgements by putting those decisions into the guise of his own judges, perhaps most especially judge Bullingham.

Leo McKern, a well-known British character actor perhaps most famous internationally for 'A Man for All Seasons' and 'Shoes of the Fisherman', found this great role late in life, and became the quintessential image for Rumpole. He performed the role through all the episodes (presented in the UK originally starting in 1978, and continuing with a few gaps through 1992, and presented in the USA via the PBS Mystery series approximately the same time), joined by two different actresses portraying Hilda Rumpole (Peggy Thorpe-Bates and Marion Mathie), affectionately referred to as 'She Who Must Be Obeyed'. Rumpole's mannerisms and penchant for the less genteel things in life are done by McKern in a perfect contrast to the others in Chambers, be they Guthrie Featherstone (played by Peter Bowles as an upper-middle, Conservative-Labour MP QC) or 'Soapy Sam' Ballard (Peter Blythe), Claude Erskine-Brown (Julian Curry) or Phyllida Erskine-Brown ne Trant (Patricia Hodge).

There are set pieces about these episodes, but they are far from formulaic. Unlike some American counterparts with which one might hazard a comparison, Rumpole does not always win the case, although he almost always solves the mystery. Rarely do cases turn on points of law (indeed, Phyllida Erskine-Brown, the 'Portia' of Chambers once remarked that Rumpole knew nothing of law, but did know how to win over a jury), but the cases usually involve issues of eccentricity, both among those in the legal profession as well as among those who have need of the legal profession. Most shows involve several subplots, and the line between victory and defeat is often blurry. However, there will always be an England, at least in certain ways: As Rumpole said once during a defence, the English nation when it is long gone will be remembered for three things -- the English breakfast, the Oxford Book of English Verse (the Quiller-Couch Edition), and the presumption of innocence - this is Rumpole's mantra, and his statement of faith.

Rumpole is always for the defense - even in the later story of 'Rumpole for the Prosecution', in which Rumpole is hired to conduct a private prosecution, he manages to provide through his searching for the truth the best defence for the defendant. Rumpole, it seems, will never be anything but the champion for the defence.

This set includes the episodes from each series as well as the two-hour telefilm, 'Rumpole's Return', a re-introduction to Rumpole after the early run of shows which ended with Rumpole nearing retirement. The disc with 'Rumpole's Return' includes several other bonus features, including a brief biography of John Mortimer, a brief history of the Old Bailey, and a list of executioners of the Old Bailey neighbouring Newgate Prison, the last of whom performed his final duty in 1902.

This is a great set piece that fans of mystery, fans of legal drama (with more than a small hint of wit and, occasionally, the ridiculous) and fans of British television generally will find a joy to view. Sit back with your favourite glass of red wine (Chateau Fleet Street comes highly recommended) and wander into a London which is a blend of the thoroughly modern and practically medieval.

This set has two listings - both of which contain 14 DVDs and all 42 episodes of Rumpole from the A&E collection.  While there is minor editing in the shows, the actual availability of these discs more than makes up for that.",1146787200,10,3893,5.026356589147287
