7204940,5,B00Y0QOK92,"Revenge stories have been around for a long time and the movies that are successful in bringing these stories to our screens do so with great presentation, story, and character.  The movie is beautiful with it's locations, sets, props, and costumes.  The story is brilliantly ugly with the unfortunate circumstances that the main character finds himself in.  I thought the set up for the film was perfect.  A good man who has a beautiful wife and son...hasn't seen them in seven years and on the day he is finally reunited with them....wow...TRAGEDY!  I don't want to give any spoilers but as events unfolded, I found myself almost too squeamish to watch.  I couldn't help but to think, ""Man...if that was to happen to me""!  It doesn't stop there because other things follow that drive the character to his ultimate destiny of confrontation to those who have done him wrong.

I really enjoyed the film and knew nothing about it until I saw it on Amazon's new releases for Tuesday.  I watched a trailer online and decided to go for it.  I've always loved western films and although this story is a familiar one, I thought the presentation here was excellent.  The setup of the characters at the beginning was very well done.  Seeing these events unfold made me curious as to how the main character was going to handle this.  As he obtains justice for one tragedy, another soon finds it's way into his life and this propels the story further and he eventually meets the ultimate villain in the story....and what a villain he is!  There are some very brutal scenes in the film especially where this bad guy is concerned!

The acting was very well done and I am impressed with Eva Green!  What a gorgeous actress.  She doesn't say a word throughout the entire film and has to rely on her eyes, facial expressions, and body language.  Again, I don't want to spoil what part her character plays in all of this, but you'll find her character and Eva Green's performance to be outstanding.

I really enjoyed the film and was impressed by the acting, music, setting/scenery, and story.  I thought that the main character was very realistic and not too much of a ""super-hero gunslinger"".  It's a beautiful looking film and it looks amazing on Blu Ray.  For fans of the western genre this is a must see film!",1438905600,5,2297,4.647642679900744
7204941,5,B00Y0QOK92,"I was thoroughly engaged in this movie from beginning to end. The acting was fantastic, excellent cinematography, costumes, etc. There are some shots that are so good I had to watch a couple times: an example would be when the gang is riding into to town the first time, the high shot as a crowd of people move out out of the way, it just seemed so authentic, natural. Seems simple, but those bits of something organic just makes scenes so much better.

As far as characters, Hollywood has a tendency to make unstable people over-the-top crazy, to the point of being silly. The bully on the stage at the beginning seemed very realistic to actually be scary because of the perceived unpredictability. I could go on but suffice it to say as  fan of westerns, this was very enjoyable! Ever since Vahalla Rising, I've been a fan of Mads Mikkelsen, and he is excellent in this film.

Check it out!",1438819200,,892,4.527950310559007
7204942,4,B00Y0QOK92,"The Western Genre has virtually mutated into various action/adventure movies and television shows with its reverberations emitting now and then to prove that it has never left us.  Over the years we have seen low budget forays and big budget homages such as Director Quentin Tarantino's 'DJANGO UNCHAINED'-2012 trying to invigorate the genre.  Here we have Director Kristian Levring's 'THE SALVATION' and it turns out to be a wonderful surprise.  The film encapsulates the core of the quintessential Western: Revenge and Salvation all in its running time utilizing three major actors who are so underrated to the point of being ludicrous:  Mads Mikkelson who is currently acting in the underrated and unfortunately cancelled series 'HANNIBAL'  ; Jefferey Dean Morgan who always brings brilliance and intelligence to his roles and also lost an underrated series 'MAGIC CITY' to the corporate manure; and  the beautiful, bewitching Eva Green who is currently shining in the Showtime series 'PENNY DREADFUL'.  All bring a poignant resonance to the proceedings making this a revelation for Western fans.  You have read the plot in the other reviews so click the add to cart button  if you want to view a brilliant excursion buffered by the gorgeous photography by Jens Schlosser.  The locales of Almeria ,Spain abetted the  Euro Westerns during the sixties and seventies and now we have the arid,bleak landscapes of South Africa to aid in the films atmosphere. Highly recommended.",1438819200,,1476,5.238297872340426

7204945,5,B00Y0QOK92,"A movie for western fans; a genre in film decline the past couple decades. All the elements of westerns - damsel in distress; western town; stage coach; vast vistas; townspeople of various goodness/badness qualities; and, coup de grce, almost singularly it's one nice guy against many baddies.
Similar to the exceptional ""The Dark Valley"", it is a western without a direct American foundation. ""The Dark Valley"" was a German-Austrian endeavor filmed in Austria while this film's credits are mostly Danish, Scottish, French actors and filmed in South Africa. Lead actors are Danes as are the writer and director. As one indicator of the production quality the town sets were fully built and not just frontal facades. All of this could be a bit disconcerting to the authentic western experience, but if one thinks about it, the American west was being populated by mostly immigrant farming, ranching, mining Europeans during the classic mid to late 1800s.",1438214400,,953,5.15483870967742
7204946,4,B00Y0QOK92,"Set in 1871 America, The Salvation starts with a mild-mannered Danish settler named Jon (Mads Mikkelsen), who has been in the West with his brother Peter (Mikael Persbrandt) for seven years. Now Jon finally reunites with his wife and son, who have travelled from Europe. One terrible thing happens to them, however, and Jon, driven by anger, kills a young cowboy.

The cowboy happens to be a younger brother of Colonel Delarue (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), leader of the gang who dominates the local town of Black Creek with violence. Delarue sets out for revenge immediately, telling the townspeople to find the murderer. If they dont, they have to pay the price dearly.

Eva Green plays Delarue's widowed sister-in-law Madelaine (who never speaks deprived of her tongue); Eric Cantona is The Corsican, a right-hand man to Delarue; and Jonathan Pryce is slippery Mayor Keane.

The Salvation is in a way a love letter to Western movies from Danish director Kristian Levring (King Is Alive). You may notice references to Western classics though the story itself is not particularly original. What is unique about the film is its photography effectively using light and darkness and barren landscapes (the film was shot in South Africa). And of course Mads Mikkelsen, as intense as ever. Enjoy it.",1437782400,13,1288,5.037558685446009

7205039,3,B00Y0QOK92,"I'm a big fan of Mads Mikkleson body of work. That's why I was excited to see this movie. It was a decent but very clichd film. It went through the checklist of revenge western staples. It felt like a fan of American westerns got the opportunity to make one. Nothing was really added to the genre. It was well filmed but I don't see myself watching it again any time soon.

One of my big issues with the film is the way a huge group of townspeople are so easily cowed by a relatively small group of gun men. And they stay cowed doing what the bad men say. I imagin the director was not from the U.S. (I didn't see who the director was) or was terribly familiar with life in the American west. People went armed and were not adverse to violence as a way of resolving issues. When gangs such as the James gang or the Dalton's robbed a bank the townspeople would grab their firearms and attack. Many groups of bad guys lost more of their members to locals and possys than they did to law enforcement. The unarmed populace in Europe may have behaved the way the townspeople in the movie did. Not in the U.S. I don't think the director understands our gun culture or it's impact on Amercan history. I had other gripes but that was the most glaring.

Not bad, not great. Wait for it on NetFlix or Cable.",1442966400,,1297,4.225806451612903

The story is somewhat familiar, most revenge flicks follow the same formula, but the difference here is that the acting is so mind-blowingly good and the characters so fascinating that you can't look away. You're invested every step of the way. My only nitpick is that Eva Green, an amazing actress destined to become a film legend, is drastically underused.

7205057,4,B00Y0QOK92,"The Salvation is an extremely well made Western with a good story, a good cast, excellent direction, and some breathtaking scenery.  What more could you want out of a Western?  How about a new twist?  OK, not entirely new, more out of the ordinary.

The twist is a similar one to the 1958 Sterling Hayden Western, Terror in a Texas Town.  The hero of the story is a foreigner.  In this case an ex Danish soldier who came to America with his brother to set up a homestead and bring his wife and son over once they have enough money.  Once his wife and son arrive all seems great - until they are killed by a couple drunk Western thugs.  John, the character played by Mads Mikkelson (and very well played, by the way) kills the thugs in retaliation.  But there's a problem - one of the thugs was the brother of the leader of a ring of thugs who himself now wants revenge.

The back and forth of this vengeance tale is well told, and at about an hour and a half the pacing is near perfect.  The Salvation is a must have for any serious Western fan - especially those who enjoy both the classic Westerns of Anthony Mann and the ones directed by Sergio Leone.  The style of this movie is somewhere in between those two, and it is very effective.  Danish director Kristian Levring directs this movie with both love and attention to detail (apparently, he had an entire animated movie made as a guide rather than just using storyboards).  It had been Levring's dream since childhood to direct a Western, and this movie shows that deep passion for the subject.

Buy it. You'll be glad you did.  The Blu Ray looks spectacular (clean, crisp, clear - just fantastic) and the movie is excellent.",1440288000,2,1683,4.415584415584416
7205058,5,B00Y0QOK92,"Mads Mikkelsen is awesome. Great revenge western, loved it!",1439942400,,59,5.666666666666667
7205059,5,B00Y0QOK92,"What a surprise! A Danish produced and directed film about Immigrants from Denmark in the starkly Wild West circa 1880. The hero was a soldier in the Old Country which means he understands violence, abjures it but is unusually skilled at unleashing it when he is provoked beyond measure.
Jeffrey Dean Morgan whom I last saw as the Good Bad Guy (an indigenously American character in movies) in the mini-series MAGIC CITY plays the apocalyptically evil villain, so evil in fact I could scarcely believe such a man existed, but Jeffrey Dean Morgan acts from a core of truth that makes the character not only terrifying but credible. We understand this man even as we mourn how degraded he has become. This is as close to Sympathy for the Devil as I ever want to come, but somehow, with no flamboyance or false moves, this consummate actor makes the Bad Bad Guy real. And Mads Mikkelsen effortlessly conveys the break-down of a peaceful, courteous, family man into a relentless killer. Echoes of HIGH NOON and other classic Westerns haunt the script, just as John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Jack Palance, et alia shape the performances. But I like a movie that knows it's part of a tradition and builds on that foundation with clarity of purpose and integrity of execution. In many Westerns like this one the justification of violence goes beyond self-defense to embrace a cleansing of society, like Odysseus's slaughter of the suitors with the gods' approval. The movie's title shows that such is the case here, but it is not a blanket summons to violence. The moral cost to the soul of the killer, whether a bad man or good man, is an eloquent secondary theme woven into the story. Victory followed by regret, justice achieved without mercy, love maybe surviving the violence - the ending is ambiguous, indefinite: Is it a New Beginning or More of the Same? The movie is wise and generous. and leaves that for the viewer to resolve.",1439683200,4,1924,4.746268656716418

7205062,4,B00Y0QOK92,"Very fine western, A quality cast, and good direction. Typical story of man out for revenge. But Mikkelsen does a fine job. For the low price ($9.00) the film is better than most contemporary westerns (Texas Rising) comes to mind.....Dreadful. I couldn't place the western setting in this film, and no wonder, it was filmed in South Africa.

Eva Green was completely wasted in this movie.  She plays a woman whose tongue was cut out by Indians so she has no dialogue.  The John Wick movies are violent but at least the people being killed are killers themselves.  In this movie three innocent townspeople are killed... each is shot in the head.  Actually, killed is not the correct description.  They were sacrificed by the sheriff, literally.  I just wasn't buying it.",1526860800,,572,4.603960396039604

In the 3:10 TO YUMA, THE GREY, and THE REVENANT strain in recent film, THE SALVATION is an interesting perspective into the vengance arc, Western shoot 'em up action thriller with this 1st generation Scandinavian settler in the Wild West.
