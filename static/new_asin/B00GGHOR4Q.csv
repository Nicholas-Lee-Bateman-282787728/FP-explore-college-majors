6075192,2,B00GGHOR4Q,"Too short.  I was disappointed after watching the first film.  Less is more is better.  Over exaggerated male body parts maybe funny once, but after third or forth time, really.  An title for the movie: ""attack otaku, they are weird hentai people.""",1409184000,,248,4.833333333333333
6075193,4,B00GGHOR4Q,"I actually enjoyed this more than number 1, funnier ,sexier and a little more outlandish. Good , cheesy entertainment. The woman are starting to fight back yeah",1402963200,,160,4.962962962962963
8622768,4,B00GGHOR4Q,"The second in the series and actually pretty good, better than the first. This movie like the first and third in this series are what would be labeled T&A movies here in the US, but it has a decent plot and a timeline. If you are watching just for the nudity, fine, but there is not a lot of it. There is a story being told here, along with spoofing  a number of things in Japanese culture. So if you unaware of Japanese culture you may not get a lot of things in this movie. It is enjoyable, but won't win any prizes.",1459641600,,518,4.029126213592233

8622771,4,B00GGHOR4Q,It's a funny movie but be warned up front while most campy Japanese horror can be risqu to gross this movie crosses the line to be more of soft core porn and promoting a rape culture.,1444348800,,183,4.111111111111111

8622775,4,B00GGHOR4Q,"Nuclear torn Tokyo has become ground zero for the ultimate battle of the sexes and most men have been turned into rape zombies and those that haven't, like to watch. The film is basically zombies rape women. The backdrop of Tokyo is drawn. I don't recall seeing any woman in a sexy nurse's outfit depicted on the cover, but the blond is an android who gets raped in her first scene. She has laser beams that come out of her eyes and other weapons for her orifices. Zombie men can only be killed by having their little head cut off. The Amazon women live in a man-less society, go figure the end result. During a zombie rape attack, the camera is jerked around to create excitement, because disfigured zombies ripping the clothes of a whining woman isn't enough.

On the surface the film seems like mindless trash to indulge the male fantasy, and it is, but at the same time it contains commentary directed at men who like Anime women as being part of the problem. There is discussion of sex vs love, the outlaw of rape, and man's primitive urges needing to be satisfied by women who only refuse them.

Guide: The film shows a large deformed male organ. Women are frequently topless. One quick bottomless scene on Blondy the robot, and she looked like a mannequin.  Most likely a flesh g-string.  Not much plot and barely an hour in length.",1423699200,7,1339,4.520661157024794
