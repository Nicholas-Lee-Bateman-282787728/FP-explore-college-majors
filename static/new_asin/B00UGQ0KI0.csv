8706180,5,B00UGQ0KI0,"Due to an extraordinary event Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve) longing for an earlier time (1912) is introduced to a method that will accomplish this. There he finds love (Jane Seymour.) Will he stay or is there more in store for him? The answer lies ""Somewhere in Time.""

The story is based on a novel by Richard Matheson with a score by John Barry.
For those that may forget the details of this movie they will not forget Variation 18 of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.

It is well conceived and paced for the content. The viewing audience is polarized as to whether this is the type of film they would watch, but all agree in the quality of this one. I personally think it is a keeper.",1503014400,,714,4.484615384615385
