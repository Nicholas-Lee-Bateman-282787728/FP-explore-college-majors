2614764,5,B000GL15HK,"This set has been more than I hoped for.  It teaches basic steps and drills, and a very beginner speed, then he shows you how by pacticing you get faster and faster, it is awesome.  It is great for beginners, but it will sure make you even better if you are intermediate or advanced.",1186099200,18,283,4.222222222222222
2614765,5,B000GL15HK,"I began with Tap Dance some months ago by myself. I tried my exercises with some other DVD's, but these two DVD's ""Tap Notes Vol. 1 & 2"" with Louis McKay are the very best of all!

He starts with an easy practicing at a slow speed and shows always where you can get on. Because of the two views from behind the teacher - like being in a class - and the special sight showing his feet - it's simple to follow the instructions.

I love it so much to take on my shoes and train with Louis. It's great - I become better and better, faster and faster. It's every time great fun!

So I've ordered the third one ""The Class"" and look forward to combine my basic steps I've learned with ""Tap Notes Vol. 1 & 2"".

I recommend these DVD's very much to every one!!!

Thank you, Louis and Co.!",1166054400,35,779,4.032467532467533

2614767,5,B000GL15HK,"Tap Notes 1 & 2 are fantastic and a great way to learn the basics of tap. The instructor is clear, positive and inspiring. I had some tap instruction as a child but wanted to get back into it as an adult and didn't know where to start. I was lucky to find these videos because they gave me the confidence and the ability to do the steps. My grandson and I love to watch the video and are learning together. We're excited about starting tap class at a local dance school, but we'll continue to practice at home with these videos. We're having so much fun!!",1160784000,18,555,4.196261682242991

8133325,5,B000GL15HK,"I was frustrated on how lame tap classes were, and their lack of teaching ability.  Most notable was the lack of ability to explain what tap is and how the individual steps work together in the bigger picture.  Louis hits a home run with this and allowed me to understand the bigger picture.  I am so grateful that he takes the time to point out which steps are most important for building speed and technique early on and that he takes his time so we can follow.  Just as important he shows us what the move looks like at full speed which is very important as the finished product.  Bravo and many thanks Louis!",1398988800,2,612,4.333333333333333
8133326,5,B000GL15HK,My goal was to find dvds that could teach me routines and warm-up to be used for working out while having fun tap dancing!  This dvd was a perfect resource!,1381795200,3,156,4.2
8133327,5,B000GL15HK,It has been several years since taking my last tap dance. This DVD was what I was looking for. I felt as if I were in a dance class taking a class. Just remember to stretch a little before tap dancing and to do stretch afterwards. I highly recommend this DVD!,1376092800,3,259,4.098039215686274
8133328,5,B000GL15HK,I am learning steps that looked difficult in the past. Appreciate & enjoy the instruction and the demonstraton by Mr. McKay.,1331769600,4,124,4.9523809523809526
8133329,5,B000GL15HK,"I think this is a great instructional DVD. It goes slow enough for you to master the steps and just the right amount of practice before going on to the next step. I highly recommend it. It has helped me to do the steps correctly.
I  consider myself a beginner having only taking adult class once  week for the past few years and wanted to improve my foot technique and find his methods very helpful with the views he show of the foot work. It is like being in the studio with your private instructor.",1322524800,4,500,4.252631578947368
