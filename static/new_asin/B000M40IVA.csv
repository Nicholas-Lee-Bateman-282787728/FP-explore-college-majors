8200833,1,B000M40IVA,"This dvd is a bootleg that ain't worth the powder to blow it to Hades.  The makers of the DVD do not respect copyright laws and from the looks of the dvd they don't care about quality either. It's a dvd-r, by the way, and who want's to pay $25 for a copy?  I am surprised AMAZON can't seem to get its act together in policing its own site.",1198713600,4,339,3.898550724637681
