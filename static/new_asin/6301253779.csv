7811192,5,6301253779,Confused between entitled 'Collector's Item and Venus in Furs --- but can't complain about having both --- never can get enough of Laura Antonelli --- even duplicates.,1432944000,2,167,5.222222222222222

7811194,1,6301253779,"BEWARE!! IT IS NOT ""WIFEMISTRESS"", in spite of the same name of the principal actress - Laura Antonelli. it is a totally different movie, even though it somehow mimmics the original Wifemistress.",1327449600,3,195,5.125
7811195,4,6301253779,"Laura Antonelli (Malizia) stars as Maria, who 15 years earlier as a 15-year (I think) old fell for an older man who took advantage of her innocence and dumped her.  Finally 15 years later and still in love and infatuated, she finds him, moves into a nearby apartment, and sets a trap (another title for this film is La Gabbia (The Trap)) so he cannot escape her again.  He is a very uncooperative prisoner. But then her young daughter, a willing accomplice, then falls for him as well.  Realistic in that it is the jerks of the world that women fall for.  In view of what happens, those who consider this film worthless are more likely to be men than women.",1271721600,9,657,4.404958677685951
7811196,1,6301253779,"No need for details, this movie is total garbage. Lousy plot line if any. Unattractive actors. Terrible film to DVD transfer. Spotty audio.  A total waste of time and money",1239580800,12,172,4.733333333333333
7811197,4,6301253779,"Bought this for Laura's appearance.  Was not disappointed.  Disliked the male lead, had no sympathy for the actor's character.  The teen daughter was delicious.",1235952000,2,160,5.583333333333333
7811198,4,6301253779,"COLLLECTOR'S ITEM is a different type of film although some of the elements such as upper body nudity and love situations are presented. A plain gym is living with his lover. She goes away for Christmas. After she leaves, walking around he sees an old paramour with whom there were steamy relationships. She lives on the opposite side of the hall.  He rings and his sexy paramour's young daughter answers. Will he have love with mother and daughter? Not exactly.

The lady, upset that he left her decides to keep him as hostage after their rekindling. He is tied up in bed helpless. She tries to take him and he spits in her face. The paramour becomes even more convinced that she must keep him forever. So she strips trying to lure his attention.
Very enticing.  Her delicious teen daughter watches some of the love making and wants to learn about sex too, via him.  She teases him to the point where he bites off her bra.  However, her commitment to mother wins out. He remains tied.  At this time, his live-in companion starts getting
concerned as to his wearabouts.

The mother and daughter get into a fight over the guy. He tries to escape and gets a deep stab wound in the gut.  They try stitching up his wounds
with little success. Yet this time he is able to break off the restraints
and tries to get out of the door. His wound is severe. He collapses.

Meanwhile the live-in starts in ernest to find him.  The film shows
female masturbation in a natural, non-erotic way. Yet the film tingles with suspense, conflicts and heat.  The film is worth watching just to
see the performers play their roles powerfully.  Erotica helps. I was
tempted to rate this 5****. It has originality but also forseeability.

This is a good movie to enjoy alone or with companions.  Suspense galore.
The ladies are lucious.  Droll while you sit mezmerized.",1202774400,13,1844,4.5963302752293576
