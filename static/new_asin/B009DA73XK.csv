5319226,5,B009DA73XK,"This movie was a lot of fun. To think Osama Bin Laden coming back as a zombie, awesome idea! This way we can kill him all over again. I enjoyed the plot, the direction as well as the acting. Well worth watching. Getting ready to watch it a third time.",1358380800,2,251,4.04
5319227,3,B009DA73XK,"OK, killing lots of slow type zombies, nice guns. unbelievable parts include a civilian female carrying a ruger .22 when plenty of AK47s are laying all around and a female infantryman with hair hanging down almost to her belt, like that will not get tangled in the brush. also thinks she is a ninja, ha. guess they had to put her in for the PC types. Most important info about the movie, NO BOOBS SHOWN.",1357257600,4,403,4.386666666666667
5319228,4,B009DA73XK,"It's a zombie movie, go in with low expectations and be pleasantly surprised. The blonde chick can really kick some ass. The brunette isn't half bad either.",1348185600,10,156,4.814814814814815
5319229,3,B009DA73XK,"If you read the manufacturer's description of the movie, you know it is going to be bad. The question is the degree of bad, and does it make for a decent zombie film? Derek Miller (Jasen Wade) is a conspiracy buff who goes to Afghanistan to kill Osama bin Laden because he believes he is still alive. His sister Dusty (Eve Mauro) takes off after him. In all of Afghanistan they manage to both meet up with the same special forces unit killing zombies. One of which is a cute blond named ""Tomboy"" (Danielle Chuchran) who shoots zombies and lops their heads off with her sword while wearing a ponytail. They are the front line against a world zombie infestation. There is a scene which describes the zombie creation, i.e. ""acute biological mutations"".

That is pretty much the entire film, hunting and killing zombies. Some of the zombies are fast moving, while others are leg ""drag-ers"". There is no consistency. While they are supposed to require head shots, some fall down from a sword to the chest. The special effects are CG: helicopters, gun fire, blood splatter, and even the camp fire. The zombie make-up was decent. The plot could have used a little more variation. The dialogue was solid ""B"" grade which included a series of bad, somewhat politically incorrect old jokes. I used the punch line from one of the jokes as my title. The Afghans speak in Arabic and the film uses subtitles in case you forgot what ""Allahu akbar"" means.

No sex, nudity or F-bombs that I recall, just some good old fashion blood splatter. Don't spend too much.",1337385600,11,1545,4.655677655677656
5319231,1,B009DA73XK,"Great idea, but crappy movie. Was hoping it would be like one of those sic-fi channel movies like Sharknado or Sharktopus.",1395878400,,122,4.857142857142857
5319232,5,B009DA73XK,What if Osama And His Followers Were all Zombies? You Do A Night Of The Living Dead On Them Humour and Sarcasm Are A vital part Of This Small Film I AM Glad I Bought It,1393804800,,168,3.6944444444444446
5319233,1,B009DA73XK,I strive to be as honest as possible about my movie reviews. I remember beginning to watch this movie and it was so bad that I turned it off. It appeared to be filmed on a shoe string budget and was just plain awful.,1392681600,,216,3.9318181818181817
5319234,3,B009DA73XK,"There was more of a story to this movie than with most zombie movies!
I didn,t think it was that bad at all!",1392249600,,108,3.739130434782609
5319235,4,B009DA73XK,"This movie sounds cheesy to the max, but it was surprisingly entertaining. The characters are likable, the setting seems realistic, and the goofy premise seems plausible for a horror movie. Corey Sevier seems to take his shirt off way more than necessary, and there are some stupid characters to contend with, but it was a fun way to pass 90 minutes. I can't say that it was genuinely scary, but it does have some tense moments in caves.",1390348800,,437,4.615384615384615
5319236,4,B009DA73XK,Funny great laughs I enjoyed and recommended for the entertainment . this is all please submit if you want anything else see for yourself.,1384905600,,138,4.791666666666667
5319237,2,B009DA73XK,"What if Osama bin Laden wasn't dead? He has turned into a zombie and is still ""living"" out there. ""Osombie"" is based on this weird premise, but about 80 percent of the film's story is not really about OBL. ""Osombie"" is mostly a routine zombie action movie that is only passable and nothing special.

A ragtag team of soldiers is sent to Afghanistan, where people are turned into zombies. During the mission they combat a horde of undeads, rescue a woman Dusty (Eve Mauro) looking for her missing brother, before encountering Al-Qaeda leader.

Acting is fine and zombie effects are decent, but ""Osombie"" suffers from the pedestrian storytelling and cardboard characterizations. The bleak location (in the Utah desert) is effectively used, but explosions and gore effects using CG are disappointing, and action sequences are repetitious.

If you are looking for some campy fun, like outrageous situations and over-the-top characters, you will be disappointed. Also, as a zombie action movie, ""Ozombie"" lacks style. The film is all about one idea that is not fully explored.",1379721600,,1071,5.14367816091954
5319238,5,B009DA73XK,Very entertaining movie full of syfy special effects.  It has a definite syfy cult movie vibe to it.  I really liked it and bet you will to.,1374451200,,140,4.148148148148148
5319239,1,B009DA73XK,"It's a boring movie. I watched first 43 minutes but then I fast forwarded it and I don't regret that. The actors are okay, but none of them are likable. The plot is ridiculous, and there should not be made any movies about real life terrorist, other than documentary. The special effects are average.",1373760000,,300,4.574074074074074
5319240,5,B009DA73XK,this is the true story that Obama is covering up. the dead does come back to life to haunt the earth,1368144000,3,100,3.8095238095238093
5319241,3,B009DA73XK,"Just watxhing it as I type this. Nato troops head into Afghanistan on the hunt for Bin Laden. The Taliban have become zombies. Plenty of gore and violence. Lots of humour, interesting dialogue and good acting. Eve Mauro is hot. See her in The Steam Experiment. It's a good concept. You should rent/buy War Of The Dead and Outpost. Salaam alaikum.",1366329600,2,346,4.688524590163935
5319242,5,B009DA73XK,"Osombie is the story of a group of marines and a yoga instructor who are stranded in Iraq hunting down Middle Eastern zombies. On the surface this sounds like a dumb, implausible and annoying movie but in reality this is entertaining from start to finish. It's original, the dialogue is fluid and realistic, the graphics are great though fairly cheesy and dangers the team is put in is refreshing. From team members turning into zombies while holding grenades to fighting zombies in a land mine field to having zombies on one side and enemy soldiers on the other this is a great and relentless action flick.

I expected this to be a dumb afternoon matinee but by the end of it I was ready to buy it off amazon. It's easily one of the best zombie films I've seen in a long time and I make no exaggeration in saying I've seen all of them.

The team is logical and realistic without any typical movie drama and a complete lack of stupid typical movie mistakes. There's no pointless nudity, no unnecessary language and the gore is kept in control which is just amazing to have in a modern zombie flick.

This is a really great flick and should be watched by anyone who enjoys action or zombie flicks. I really can't express how surprised I am by this and how much I recommend it.",1366070400,,1275,4.44017094017094
5319243,4,B009DA73XK,This was a well produces and well acted zombie movie with a neat idea. I recommend it to anyone liking zombie movies,1364860800,3,116,4.318181818181818
5319244,3,B009DA73XK,"I think, once word got out that a mainstream film about taking Osama out was in the works, this was a bit of jumping on the chance to make a band wagon type of thing.  The film takes a bit of a mental stretch to get into it and then you do better.  Acting was okay, make up were okay, and we got slow moving Zoms (always okay) and this is bio-war tactics gone to the dogs, so you can already visualize the plot.  Not a bad film and worth a watch no and again while waiting for other films - but really suggest you hold out for the $5.95 sale bin before you buy it.  Lots of good stuff here - just no real surprises when it is not hard to know what is going to happen, now you are just waiting to see, what you already figure out.  But, good effort for a non-major studio budget and not a film to dislike, but I just could not rate more than I did - so one of many good INDY films out there that has its own little nitch - and you already know from the title and cover art where you are headed - so buyer be advised in advance.",1364169600,,1026,3.8207547169811322
5319245,3,B009DA73XK,"While the title and subject matter was a little unique and made me almost not buy the movie.

However, I am glad I did. For a Zombie movie it was very entertaining. It was not your classic zombie movie,

but I liked the change of pace and the acting was good.",1362441600,3,259,4.0588235294117645
5319246,4,B009DA73XK,movie is basically a zombie movie about a group looking for Bin Laden. If you like military movies it is worth seeing. I would recommend it.,1362182400,3,140,4.423076923076923
5319247,3,B009DA73XK,"Interesting concept of having Ben Laden be a Zombie.  Zombies were ok.  Not a superb movie, but not horrible either",1360454400,3,115,4.7
5319248,4,B009DA73XK,"I watched a trailer for this movie and it caught my eye. Anyone who knows me knows that I am a sucker for a ""B"" movie especially when it comes to sci fi and horror. Once you get past the stupid basic premise for this movie you will find that is a well executed action movie. For those who have not figured out the basic story Osama Ben Laden comes back as a zombie. The action stems around a spec ops team trying to find a nest of terrorists while killing zombies along the way. While weak on characterization the action sequences are pretty cool and dare I say satisfying. I won't spoil the ending except to say that Ben Laden gets what he deserves once again!! This movie is worth a look as a rental but not one I would buy.",1359676800,2,726,4.119718309859155
5319249,5,B009DA73XK,b movie goodness in all its gory hubris like a syfy sat night so sit back and enjoy if you like the genre,1359504000,2,105,3.608695652173913

8540132,5,B009DA73XK,"First and foremost, I am not a fan of the Zombie genre. They are like the Portland Rose Festival parade. You've seen one, you've have seen them all. The only difference is the floats each year. That said, I gave the movie a five because of it being a Mainstay Productions / Arrowstorm Entertainment movie, and the actors/actresses in the movie. I loved Eve Mauro's portrayal of Dusty and Danielle Churchran's portrayal of Tomboy. That's all there is to it.",1530403200,,456,4.7125
8540133,3,B009DA73XK,An interesting take on the zombie genre. May be a little too cheezy for some.,1508716800,,77,4.2
8540134,3,B009DA73XK,"ok this film is low buget but hey i like it oh sure the plot flew so far outa the window but sit back eat popcorn and watch it for what it is its funny its zombies and its well one hell of a plot ideal and the price come on go for it i did lol

8540138,5,B009DA73XK,creepy,1432944000,,6,6.0
8540139,2,B009DA73XK,Bit cheesy and mean spirited. Some of these actors deserve better. I'm a big Danielle Chuchran fan and I couldn't turn this down.,1421798400,,129,4.6521739130434785
8540140,1,B009DA73XK,"Interesting premise, ridiculous movie!  And what's with Corey Sevier continuously taking off his shirt to fight in combat scenes?  Osama Bin Ladin taking a shot and becoming a zombie and releasing other zombies on the world?  Bad movie and Sevier made it worse.",1401667200,,261,5.023255813953488
8540141,4,B009DA73XK,"I'm a zombie movie fan, as in fanatic.  There are no bad zombie movies, just some better than others.  Osombie is a true zombie movie, Osama is dead and comes back.  His followers rally once again behind the Imam of Death who is now the Dead Imam of Death.  A team of zombie killers go out for sundry reasons and wind up losing team members, picking up stragglers and in the end doing what Americans always do, save the day.

Some may find the acting a little amateurish, and the gunshot effects are over the top (one shouldn't shoot zombies with a large caliber sniper's rifle akin to the Barrett .50 cal).

Suspend disbelief and enjoy the show.  Sorry guys, the T & A is more a matter of imagination than a feature of the film.",1397088000,,729,4.3161764705882355
