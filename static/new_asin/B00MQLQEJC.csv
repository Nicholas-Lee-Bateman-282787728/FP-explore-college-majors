6599958,3,B00MQLQEJC,I thought the story line promised much but it was not to be.  Stalham was the only actor to put some life into his character. The other two were forgettable. A closer examination (if you buy a copy) will in my opinion reveal a low budget attempt. Some of country side scenes gave some redemption.,1438905600,,296,4.381818181818182

6599960,5,B00MQLQEJC,"This is a review of the In The Name Of The King Collection Blu-Ray. This is not a review of the films. If you're actively seeking out Uwe Boll films on Amazon you know exactly who he is and what he does and you know what you're getting yourself into. This is just to inform you of the details I wish I could have known before I blindly purchased it hoping the Amazon product description was misleading. The Amazon product description is misleading. This product contains 3 blu ray discs, one for each film. As far as I can tell they are the same discs as the standalone versions. They contain all the special features of the standalone versions, including Uwe Bolls commentary tracks, and the first film is the unrated directors cut version.",1435017600,11,741,4.537313432835821
6599961,2,B00MQLQEJC,"Terrible rendition(s) of the computer role playing game with the same name. The game itself was loads of fun to play and would make another target for low talent director (Uwe Boll) of this, and numerous other, junk movies!
While the first movie with Statham is watchable, 2 and 3 will just suck time out of your life.
I believe a purchase is just a waste of money but hey, who am I but ""another"" reviewer.",1433548800,2,406,4.355263157894737
