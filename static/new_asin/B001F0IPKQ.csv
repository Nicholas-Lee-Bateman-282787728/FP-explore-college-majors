It was relevant for the themes we were studying in Spanish class, having read a couple articles about Augusto Pinochet, and I was thrilled to find a low-cost documentary to show kids. They could relax a bit after turning in a large project but still learn, and it was better than just showing some random cartoon.",1458950400,,386,4.776119402985074

8300111,5,B001F0IPKQ,"Outstanding documentary. I was fascinated by the journey Guzman takes from being a conservative who had welcomed in Pinochet back in the day, to pursuing the case against the dictator. The documentary will disturb you, but it's essential viewing. More chilling, I think, then the footage of bodies unearthed, is the blind devotion of those who still regard Pinochet as a great man. The man himself was by all accounts a despicable sociopath, and he's more then earned his place in hell. It's interesting to see Guzman, a decent man, as he comes to terms with this dark period in his country's history and pursues justice.",1337040000,4,621,4.867924528301887

This DVD was very informative and entertaining.",1268956800,9,160,4.193548387096774
