1917046,5,B0000CABBT,"I would have given this film four stars (the quality suffers, not the content), but I feel Norm's review diminishes the importance of the film.  If you are at once creative and analytical, you'll find a rich depth.  In the film, Frau Junge doesn't excuse herself; in fact, I think she is too hard on herself.  And though she doesn't put on a Hollywood penance performance, she does maintain her dignity, having been troubled for the better part of a life.  Her brutal honesty can be seen in a poignant moment when she makes a comparison between herself and Sophie Scholl, who was the same age as Junge.
Although the film appears to have been shot and edited by first year film students, the film is important in that it portrays a slice of history firsthand.  Frau Junge is clearly intelligent and remarkably clear about her experience.  It is simply amazing how much detail she remembers, and after so much time!  It's also obvious that this experience colored and directed the remainder of her life.
I wish the film was longer.  I'm no history buff, but the Junge's recollections kept me glued to the set, pausing on the subtitles.  The tragedy of Junge's life is that she separated herself from her feelings and repressed her experience, when she could have found some therapy by writing a detailed first-hand historical account.  I think it would have come natural, her mind being wonderfully linear and her articulation of events easy to follow.
It will bother some people that Frau Junge's personal portrayal of Hitler, while unsympathetic, often countermands the megalomaniacal historical portrayal.  But the reality of this film is that it is not about Hitler--it's an intimate portrait about a woman named Traudl Junge who was fated to a time and to a place.",1072483200,90,1767,4.817880794701987
1917047,1,B0000CABBT,"I didn't expect much from this movie and I didn't get much.  Traudl was a simple girl with simple tastes.  She tells us in her simplistic style what it was like to be Hitler's personal secretary.  What is missing from this movie is what she said to reporters after she made the movie and the day before she died.  She said, ""I didn't see Hitler as a bad man.""  She added, ""I didn't speak out before now because I didn't want to be hounded by people.""

She might have been a simple chick, but she sure was a lot more streetwise than she lets on in her interviews.  She often makes  the point in the movie that when she read about the Holocaust, after the war, that she came to realize that Hitler was an evil man.  Yeah right, lady! Yet, Traudl actually cries when she talked about how Hitler gave the order to shoot his dog Blondie within hours of Hitler committing suicide himself in early May 1945.  Traudl doesn't cry for all her boss's human victims.  That's just plain cold.

The makers of this movie tried to get Traudl to give juicy tidbits of the daily goings on of the inner workings of the Third Reich.  We get none of that.  What we get is ancedotal tidbits about how Hitler didn't correct her typing and how Hitler never talked about the Jews in her presence.  Whoppie!  Hitler was just a regular guy, according to her.  Then again, it was her father's good buddy Martin Bormann (head of the Waffen SS) who recommended her to the job as Hitler's personal secretary.

Don't waste your time and money on seeing this almost-on-her-deathbed Nazi.  She took all her secrets to the  grave.  Who knows, maybe she even was Hitler's secret lover?  She totally glossed over the reported crazed condition of Adolf Hitler in the last year of his life.  We know for a fact that Hitler was popping pills like crazy at the end and she makes no mention of this in the movie.  Then again, who cares?  It's just a shame that Allied forces didn't do the third degree on her.  I guess she still had her good looks after the war and she made good use of her natural assets.

Please note:  I have no sympathy for ex-Nazis and fascists.  I suspect that many people who have a fascination with the Third Reich will love this movie.  In my view Traudl is just another Nazi-conformist hiding her revisionist beliefs regardless of how old she was when she did her exit interview.",1068076800,16,2364,4.405092592592593
1917048,4,B0000CABBT,"""Blind Spot"" is an interview with Traudl Junge who, as  a young woman, worked as one of Adolph Hitler's secretaries, living alongside Hitler and other prominent members of the 3rd Reich between 1942 and 1945. Before Frau Junge died, at the age of 81, she gave this interview to filmmakers Andr Heller and Othmar Schmiderer in which she recounts her experiences with and her impressions of Adolph Hitler and the last days of the Reich. Frau Junge (ne Humps) was entirely unsophisticated in political matters and an aspiring dancer when she took a job as a secretary in the Chancellery in Berlin. At her well-connected brother-in-law's urging, and in spite of her initial disinterest, she applied for and got a better position taking dictation for the Fhrer himself. Hitler was kindly and protective toward her, and she liked him. Her close proximity to him gave her firsthand knowledge of Hitler's health, his ideals, his private manners and personal habits, his paranoia, and the attempts on his life, which she describes as best she can in ""Blind Spot"". Perhaps understandably, Frau Junge had considered her position close to the Fhrer and his generals as an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the War and of Nazi policies, as she would be so near their source. Not until later did she realize that, being privy to Hitler's inner circle, she was actually in a ""blind spot"", sheltered more than anyone from what was going on in Germany. Frau Junge's description of the activity within the Chancellory in Berlin during the last few weeks of the War constitutes at least half of the film. Her account of the bizarre events of April 1945 is truly gripping. The audience can sense the panic and hopelessness that permeated the Chancellory as the Nazi empire came crumbling down. Frau Junge's description of the harrowing political and emotional roller-coaster that impending defeat set in motion is striking.

Blind Spot"" is not a good film cinematographically. It consists only of interview footage, apparently taken in a living room or den, with an occasional glimpse of Frau Junge watching her own interview, which is awkward. But the film's content is revealing and provocative, a must-see for any student of World War II or for anyone curious to understand the character of Adolph Hitler. Traudl Junge's attitude toward her own role in the Nazi regime raises an interesting question. Frau Junge was not a member of the Nazi party, nor did she do anything to harm anyone. She took dictation. After the war, she felt no guilt about working for Adolph Hitler, and no one seemed to hold it against her. It wasn't until much later, when she realized that other young Germans had not all been so ignorant of Nazi policies and that many had died trying to fight them, that Frau Junge began to feel guilty for what she had not known and eventually fell into a serious depression. At the age of 81, she still seems preoccupied by feelings of guilt for having liked a man who caused so much suffering. This begs the question: To what degree are individuals responsible for the consequences of their ignorance and/or stupidity? In this Information Age, are we all obligated to understand the things we do and say, particularly if those things affect others? Are we to be condemned for the consequences of our ignorance if they are bad? If the answer is ""yes"", I fear that all of humanity would be damned. Perhaps the answer is, ""It depends."" Traudl Junge is no longer as naive as she was as Hitler's secretary. In ""Blind Spot"" she articulates real understanding that she has gained of how and why Adolph Hitler ""manipulated the conscience"" of an entire nation. Her insights are important and interesting. But I found the questions of guilt and ignorance that her experience raises to be the most relevant and provocative aspect of her story. In German with a choice of English, French, or Spanish subtitles. There are no bonus features on the DVD.",1067990400,170,3948,4.838757396449704
1917049,5,B0000CABBT,"I was initially briefly disappointed with this video. Expecting it to be a documantary, I was surprised to see, about twenty minutes into the film, that it was  and would remain a simply filmed interview. There would be no artsy cut-aways to old newsreels, no family photos, indeed, not even a vintage, time relevant photograph of the films subject, Traudi Junge. Though I was intrigued with hearing the story of Hitlers personal secretary, I had expected something more dramatic. I soon realized that there could be nothing more dramatic than being privy to the recollections of Frau Junges short but life altering time with Hitler. Though I speak no German, and I don't doubt the word of those who have commented that one would get more out of the film should they speak German, I had no problem with the normally dreaded subtitles. Traudi Junge's expressions and inflections transcended any language barrier. When I first learned that these were memories she has never publicly, and rarely even privately, spoken of, I was doubtful. However, after watching and listening to her, and sensing the huge release from her that divulging the memories of that time gave her, and her spontaneity in  recounting those memories, I was no longer doubtful. Her bottled up emotion is palpable. I must admit that I, like many, also have my doubts about all those who claimed to know next to nothing of the carnage that Hitler and his social order were inflicting. But Frau Junge so convincingly and eloquently reflects on that time when she was but a twenty two year old, naieve young girl, that you can almost see that young girl before you, though you are looking at a woman in her early eighties. She admits to guilt at her early admiration for Hitler, and also guilt and shock at her later findings of what had been going on in the  world, outside of the insular and sheltered space of Hitler's bunker.  There is much sadness in her recounting of the wars final days, when Hitler admitted to defeat, and surrender was imminent. She talks thoughtfully and hauntingly of the planned suicides of not only herself, but Hitler, Eva Braun, Goebbles and his family, which included his six children. Though she admits to a ""black hole"" in her memories of certain events, she somehow escaped after Hitler's suicide. She was held captive at various locations after the war, then released. Her story had been buried in guilt, and the desire to forget a shameful time, best not talked about. She finally agreed to be interviewed sixty years after those events. This is a fascinating and different look at that time, and at the man who is considered a monster, the personification of evil. She now estimates him as such also, though seems as perplexed as anyone would be in describing this same man who, in private, resembled more a kindly old gentleman. Frau Junge was a thoughtful, intelligent, lovely lady, who was haunted for years by her unwanted but undeniable association with him. This is an oddly touching film about a horrific subject. That she died the day after this film premiered in 2002 is also very touching. As told by another, some of her last words were ""at last, I can begin to forgive myself...""",1067990400,16,3196,4.784420289855072

Don't know why she cannot speak english and the subtitles were too fast at times to digest. Her story is consistent with her earlier interview in 1970's.

Her insight into Hitler's personality is consistent with other accounts I have heard from other witnesses who were involved. She apparenlty did not know that Hitler's body was taken by the Russians and they did an autopsy of his remains that did NOT completely burn away. His dental records discovered later were matched to the original autopsy dental records and this indicated a direct match. Hitler had a wire running thru his jaw and the Russians drew this wire on their records.

1917066,4,B0000CABBT,"As an American Jew who speaks German, I found this lengthy interview particularly fascinating and compelling.  Traudl Junge's speech patterns and excellent articulation made it possible for me, a non-native speaker of German, to understand everything she said without the necessity of reading the subtitles.  The ability to understand what she says in her native tongue greatly enhances the insights one gains about Junge, the person.  Reading subtitles is sterile and gives no inkling into the nuances that are revealed in tone of voice and vocal inflection.  In addition, her facial expressions add color and meaning to her monologue.

At the end of the film, my overarching feeling toward Traudl Junge was one of pity.  I believe she was a victim of her own naivete and gullibility.  Her feelings of guilt and remorse seem quite genuine and sincere.  But I am left with questions for which I have no answers: should one condemn a person who, by taking dictation and performing secretarial duties, assisted in the murder of millions of people, even though she personally did nothing to harm anyone?  Should she be blamed for her ignorance and, perhaps, her stupidity?  Did she look the other way or was she truly uninformed?  These questions raise important moral and ethical issues that will probably be debated for decades.",1328140800,5,1327,5.0691244239631335

Whether you agree with her actions, imagining yourself to act in a more altruistic way, the recounting of this dark period in history is fascinating to listen to. It is hard to imagine a secretary having such intimate access to Hitler - even encountering him directly after the assassinatin attempt at Wolf's Lair! It is astounding to listen to and imagine.

I can not pass judgement on this woman - so many Germans were of the same hypnotic mindset. One can only hope that valuable lessons can be learned from such an interview - lessons that will compel each of us to recognize and never again allow such madness.",1317081600,,786,4.772058823529412

This is basically 60 minutes of very cogent, if repetitive, autobiography and recollections of an elderly woman who was in Hitler's steno pool. She says basically the same things I have heard from other folks her age - she was young, naive, insulated and just didn't think too hard about what was going on around her. She feels remorse and guilt.

She does not seem unrehearsed -- so, I'm sure she's talked with friends over the years about the subject. The film is all just of the subject speaking into the camera with little if any off camera commentary, questions or prompting. No additional footage or narrative is included.

The value I found in this film, and I agree with some who say it was poorly shot and edited, was the reflections of an 81 yo woman who knew she was dying of cancer and died days after the interview. This is as good as a death bed confession.

What interests me is this . . . Traudl Junge seems a good example (or might be a good example) of the common folk of Germany, who, like many or most Germans were moved sufficiently by his oratorical skills to at least trust him, and overlook any obvious indications that atrocities were happening during the war. Nor did she feel a need to find/discover what information there was regarding the horrible events. We now know that with a bit of effort most any German of the time could find out the awful truth. Soldiers came back on leave, Jews, the mentally handicapped, and others were roughly loaded on into train cars made for cattle or horses, and the stink from the incinerators was easily detected from surrounding towns.

I found it fascinating to listen to this woman who knew she would die soon, describe her confusion and her moral turmoil during the past decades. The question arises in the viewers mind and hers . . . how could she not have known. That is my fascination. Almost a whole population seems to have been in a similar state. Sophie Scholl knew, as did her brother . . . both who participated in the White Rose resistance movement (non-violent). If them, then why not others, many others who could have known more if the had the inclination and interest to find the truth.

In all, a disturbing revelation into the psychology of those German's raised or living during the 1930's to the end of the war.

This film left me feeling strangely depressed and with an odd sense of dread. Also, I must admit feeling some anger at this old lady for being . . . what . . . blind, naive, gullible, stupid, dense? And yet I feel sorry for her. It was only late in life that she finally had the epiphany that, yes, she could have known. I have to say it . . . how pathetic.",1243900800,3,2038,4.338582677165355

The reviewer from the New Yorker said, ""After the war, she kept herself and her story out of sight until two Austrian filmmakers, Andr Heller and Othmar Schmiderer, interviewed her two years ago, shortly before her death.""

Wrong.

A much younger (52ish) Traudl Junge, along with (a few years after finishing their Nrnberg sentences) armaments minister Albert Speer, U-Boat chief Grossadmiral (and Fhrer for a few days) Karl Dnitz and other Fhrerbunker survivors and Third Reich big shots, spoke extensively on camera throughout&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-at-War-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0002F6AH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World at War (30th Anniversary Edition)</a>, most speaking excellent English, especially Junge, to which an entire episode, ""Secretary to Hitler,"" is devoted in addition to her interviews in other episodes.

In my view, she cannot be held accountable for all the evils of the time. Having been a secretary myself, I guess I could relate to her experience. I worked in a research facility as a secretary; I didn't know what each individual lab was doing in that building. Also consider that she didn't have a father and had a hole in her heart; she was therefore easily led by her need. She took the job to better herself, not even realizing that the typing test was for a personal secretary to Hitler. She wanted out of the mailroom. She wanted more money in her paycheck as we all do. This isn't excusing the whole terror of the time, but in this woman's everyday life she was like a hamster in a wheel.",1202428800,3,810,4.266233766233766

I think I heard ""we didn't know"" about 500 times in the first 20 minutes and decided not to waste my time listening to the rest, which no doubt is fantastic. I was struck by the prosperity in evidence in the apartment and found myself wondering what she's been doing these 50 years give or take. Clearly, she comes from a good middle-class family. She had wanted to dance, was related to Hitler's right-hand man Bormann who got her the job, lived a comfortable existence unaffected by the world around her, blah, blah, blah. Why should a lady such as this trouble herself with fate of other people? This is a fair question.  50 years later, the lady doesn't have the answer. She gets a job in a concrete bunker at the peak of WWII, types death orders, and wonders how she could have missed the larger implications of what was happening.

I think once you have seen her in The World At War interview and seen the movie Downfall, we know where she is coming from. I would not waste my time on seeing anymore of this Hitler admirer.

1917078,5,B0000CABBT,"With so many excellent films concerning Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, few have transfixed me as much as ""Blind Spot."" This feature needs no graphic wartime footage to deliver its impact. Instead, the camera stays focused on Ms. Junge, who, in her early twenties as the war raged, was completely naive in her political outlook (or so she claims). This film is made more poignant in that Ms. Junge died shortly after production was completed, giving us the feeling that in these interviews, she is working to expiate a lifetime of guilt, one born of ignorance, or perhaps more accurately, a suppression of horrific reality. This makes a perfect double feature with the outstanding narrative film ""Downfall"", in which her character is featured prominently.",1184716800,5,755,5.096774193548387

A unusual perspective that is not often presented.

This is a powerful look into the inside private life of Adolph Hitler, not the man he presented to the public eye.

It is also the story of a woman who found her self unexpectedly in his employ and shelter from the reality of the rest of the world, her enlightenment to his atrocities and her survival and coming to terms with what weighed heavily on her, believing that while she was at the time unaware of his innate evil, she had contributed to his crimes too.

1917081,3,B0000CABBT,"Traudl Junge appears pleasant, well-adjusted, and thoughtful in her old age. Dying on the day that the film won awards in Europe this movie is her final statement. But, the interviewers where horrible. They never asked the key questions, rather they just allowed her to remember events and talk for almost an hour about the final days in the Berlin Bunker.

As a historical record, it's invaluable. But, as an insight into the human workings of Nazism, there is unfortunately nothing new here. Nazism and fascism in general can only function on such a large scale as it did in Germany when otherwise thoughtful people like Ms. Junge choose to create a ""blind spot"" so that the truth won't get through.

Traudl Junge was Hitler's secretary from 42-45. It is hard to fathom that she knew nothing about anything, acknowledging only one moment when DER JUDEN were discussed with Hitler. Imagine the scene: Frau Von Schirach comes to the Berghof and tells Hitler to his face that what is being done to the Jews is horrible. She is of course dismissed. Traudl Junge's assertion that she was unaware of the horrors that her boss and her colleagues were perpetrating is difficult to accept, just as Albert Speer's similar assertions are difficult to believe (especially since armaments production and concentration camps that supported such production fell under his authority as armaments minister). It seems that more than being embarrassed for being such a thoughtless automaton and servant of the modern devil and the greatest force of evil in the world in the last one hundred years, Junge seems embarrassed that she had created such a hole of fakery and self-deception around herself.

I've not read her book, and am not certain that I will. But it is a failure on the part of the interviewers to not ask her more questions. I heard only one or two questions, the rest of the entire film was Traudl talking about her experiences. More of a reminiscence than an insightful examination of her past, this movie is an addition to the historical record.

The insights that Junge must have had as a human being working so closely with Hitler and his cronies and sycophants were mainly lost in the movie. One almost feels badly for Ms. Junge, but not quite.

Later in life, she became deeply disturbed about how she could have participated in the Nazi horror at such close quarters and remained so apolitical. In a brutal catharsis of self-analysis, she describes her ""blind spot"" as remaining so oblivious to the obvious. Clearly wanting to unburden herself and to speak publically for the first time, she gave ten hours of interviews at the age of 81, just months before she died. This film has almost no cinematic style or technique. Junge sits in her modest Munich apartment, a camera is put on her, and she delivers a ninety-minute, somewhat rambling soliloquy on what it was like to be Hitler's secretary. There is little ethical or war time insight; the fascinating part, in fact, is how banal she describes Hitler --his dog, his diet, his kindly paternalism, daily lunches and dinners with him, etc. More than half of her remarks cover Hitler's last few days in his Berlin bunker, where he eventually committed suicide and his body was burned. This fascinating film could have been so much better if a savvy interviewer had plied her with questions. In German with English subtitles.",1169596800,6,1302,5.0046082949308754

1917084,5,B0000CABBT,"I got this DVD out from the library mainly out of curiosity, I have to admit that like another reviewer I was not really expecting to find this riveting, especially as it was in German with sub-titles as well as being just one person speaking to an unseen interviewer, answering questions about the years that she (Traudl Junge) spent as Hitler's youngest secretary until the fall of the bunker in Berlin in 1945.

I sat and watched this DVD without getting up for a break, it was so fascinating and I was also surprised that I felt some compassion for Traudl Junge, after all she worked for a cruel despot who ordered the murder of millions of innocent people which included not only those of the Jewish race but Gypsies, people who dared to be openly Gay, Jehovah's Witnesses and so many others I don't have enough room in this critique to name them.

Traudl Junge's ability to bring out in me, a hardened cynic when it comes to the Nazis and their crimes against humanity, any kind of compassion, shocked the socks off me I can tell you.  I sat and listened to this old and very dignified woman who made no attempt to excuse who and what she had been during the war but she never came across (at least to me) as an apologist for Hitler, rather she saw the foolishness of her youth and the absolute banality of evil into which she and many other dropped into with such ease.

She also gave an insight into a man who has become an enigma, she did not make him human, he lost his humanity long ago, but she gave a sense of who he was through her dialogue, how charming he could be, his odd little foibles such him being an ardent vegetarian and his passion for dogs, all qualities what should endear you to a person but in this case only repel you when you learn who the person is with these qualities.

Blind Spot is surprisingly riveting, you want to hear what Traudl has to say and I ended up watching it all in one go when I thought I would flick through it and watch it piece meal if at all.

Worth watching, and if you get the chance see the film ""Downfall"" and also read the book ""Until the Final Hour - Hitler's Last Secretary,"" all three will help you understand the person, Traudl Junge was and also who the man she worked for, and where as with Traudl I have some compassion, for Hitler I have no compassion whatsoever even after watching one film, one documentary and reading one book that looks at his life through the eyes of other people and no matter who the person is, you still find him wanting.",1146873600,10,2513,4.32484076433121

View the sensational 1974 documentary, ""The World At War,' narrated by Lord Laurence Olivier, and you will see a much younger Junge musing over her tenure with Hitler. Most of the information that she provides in this documentary was given in ""The World At War."" The 1974 documentary is filled with footage of Hitler. Having had relatives who were in Germany at the time, and personally knowing former German soldiers and officers, I find it difficult to believe that Junge did not know of the Nazi Death camps as both rumors and hard evidence surfaced while they were going on. I believe she knew but because of the fact that she was so taken by Hitler, perhaps she did not want to believe the rumors. My mother personally met Hitler when she was 15 and was totally mezmerized by his apparent charm and grace. At any rate, ""Blind Spot"" repeats ""The World At War"" interviews, and is a ""talking head"" that would have been better produced with raw footage with voice-over.

1917086,5,B0000CABBT,"Courageously facing the camea, Traudl Junge, the subject of ""Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary,"" submitted to an in-depth series of interviews - after more than half a century of her silence - about her time as the willing, admiring employee of one of history's greatest monsters, Adolf Hitler.

Junge had served as one of Hitler's personal secretaries from 1942 until his death by suicide in 1945. Early in the film, she recalls that her job made her feel important, as if she had landed smack-dab at the source of all information. But, in fact, she was in a ""blind spot"" from which she could not fathom the horrors perpetrated by the Third Reich. That, along with her self-analysis of being a young, too-naive girl who viewed Hitler as a sort of kindly patriarch after undergoing a fatherless childhood, may seem a trifle glib. Indeed, in the initial passages of Junge's tale this reviewer admits to feeling suspicious of her, as if she were engaging in a bit of revisionist self-history. However, that feeling soon faded with the many self-inflicted emotional hits to come, as Junge articulates with often brutal honesty the horrors of her own situation. The film's final, bitter irony is the fact that those horrors pale next to the atrocities committed under the direction of her boss.

""Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary"" is the centerpiece -- indeed basis -- for the new narrative German film about Hitler, ""The Downfall."" This reviewer has seen this film, finding it to have betrayed the critical spirit of analysis portayed by Traudl Junge in the real life documentary ""Blind Spot.""",1137801600,,1585,4.954887218045113
1917087,5,B0000CABBT,"If someone had told me that I would enjoy watching a documentary that was basically a very long interview conducted in German (a language I don't speak), I would have been skeptic. Alas, I would also have been wrong.

""Blind Spot"" is an interview with an old woman, Traudl Junge, who a long time ago was one of Hitler's secretaries. Trauld worked with him from 1942 to1945, and was the person to whom Hitler dictated his will before committing suicide. She was part of his inner circle, and as such recounts to the directors of this film (Andr Heller and Othmar Schmiderer) many events that help the spectator to understand at least a little how Hitler was in private, and how he reacted in different circumstances.

I was specially stricken by the fact that Trauld didn't realise what was happening in Germany while she worked for Hitler. Of course, she and the other secretaries that worked for Hitler didn't type anything that had to do with political or military matters, but all the same, it is incredible that she didn't get any accurate information at all about the outside world while she was working for him. When she started her new job, Trauld believed that she would be at the center of all information, but instead she entered a blind spot. Only afterwards would she learn that the man she liked, the same man who was nice towards his dog Blondie and polite with her, was a killer of millions.

Traudl Junge was a young 22-year-old woman when she became ""Hitler's secretary"", but as she recognized later, ""youth is not an excuse for ignorance"". She didn't notice, or she didn't pay attention, and for that she was remorseful. It took Trauld almost her whole life to come to terms with what she had been. Only shortly before dying of lung cancer was she able to tell to Heller and Schmiderer ""I'm starting to forgive myself.

All in all, I highly recommend this filmed interview. It doesn't have good framing, the edition is not more than average and the sounds isn't overly good. Despite that, ""Blind spot"" is a very good film on an interesting subject, and it is likely to be something that you will appreciate watching, if nothing else because it provides a different perspective on one of the world's greatest criminals.

1917088,5,B0000CABBT,"I was expecting more of a traditional documentary when I watched ""Im toten Winkel - Hitlers Sekretrin"" (""Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary""). I had made the decision to watch the theatrical film ""Der Untergang"" (""Downfall"") before watching this documentary and I was expecting not only to have footage of Traudl Junge talking about her experiences throughout her career as Hitler's secretary (rather than on the last ten days of the Third Reich that is the focus of Oliver Hirschbiegel's film), but to see photographs of Junge from that period along with news footage and visits today to the sites she is talking about. But what we have instead are almost exclusively static headshots of Junge talking, looking slightly off camera. There are a few shots of her watching what she has said on a television set, sometimes adding to what she has already talked about, and a few times we hear a voice, presumably director Andr Heller, asking questions, but mostly we have Junge sharing her memories.

I find this basic approach to be spellbinding as Junge talks about not only about how she got her job (a timely phone call helps the nervous young woman get the job), but what happened the day German officers tried to assassinate Hitler and what it was like in those last days in the bunker below Berlin. The extent to which you find her revelations to be insightful will depend entirely on how much you already known about Hitler and the Third Reich. I was struck by how surviving the assassination attempt was taken by Hitler as divine providence and a sure sign the Nazis would win the war. It was Junge who took down Hitler's last will and testament and looked forward to understanding why her country had lost the war, only to be disappointed as the Fuhrer recycled the same tired rants one last time. Throughout this 87-minute documentary you are constantly reminded how real these recollections are because of the little details (Hitler mumbled his final words to Frau Junge so that she never knew what it was he said to her). The great strength of ""Im toten Winkel"" is that this is eyewitness testimony from somebody who was there and who was not burdened with trying to themselves from being a war criminal.

The key moment for me is when Junge talks about feeling an intense personal hatred for Hitler because he killed himself and left everybody else behind trapped in that Bunker. For Junge being abandoned was the Fuhrer's great sin, or, at least, was the first thing that could see as being wrong. But it underscores how important Hitler was to Nazi Germany and Junge is certainly representative of the psychosis that afflicted the citizens of the Third Reich. Junge's key revelation is privileged by the documentary as well, since comments end the main part of documentary. The end section that follows consists of title cards explaining what happened to Junge after that point (she was never a member of the Nazi party, which played a key role in her treatment), and what changed for her in post-war Germany as she found out the world was not the way Hitler said that it was.

One thing that struck me that this documentary and ""Der Untergang"" have in common is how each has its own way of enhancing the horror of Frau Goebbels murdering her own children. In the film it was that one of the children resisted taking the ""medicine"" that would make them unconscious so the cyanide capsules could be administered. In ""Blind Spot"" it is the plea of Liesl, Eva Braun's maid, begging to take the children and try to get through, and that sick woman refusing to allow her children to live in a Germany without National Socialism. Even after all these years, the horror of those final days continues to grow.

Is ""Im toten Winkel"" an attempt at apologia by Traudl Junge? Overall, based on what we see in the documentary, I would not say that is its primary purpose. Indeed, she says that she realizes that ignorance is no excuse, and before she died she admitted that she was starting to forgive herself. She talks about the burden she felt liking Hitler when he did such terrible things, but in her stories she offers implicit explanations more than explicit excuses (the title ""Blind Spot"" is clearly Heller's take on Junge's testimony). This is her final testament and what is important is that it was recorded on film before Frau Junge died of cancer in Munich in February of 2002.",1124323200,5,4386,4.721932114882507
1917091,3,B0000CABBT,"This DVD (with not a single extra: No documentary about Hitler/the Nazis or anything else) is interesting, but with it you get two things: very detailed information of dialogue concerning Hitler as well as interesting asides on the Downfall of Nazism's last days.  Of the latter, our interviewee, Hitler's secretary, offers such odd fare as this: ""Eva Braun once said to the Fuhrer, 'You know there's a statue up there [outside, above Hitler's bunker in Berlin] and if you win the war, I'd like you to buy it for me.' And then he [Hitler] said: 'But I don't know who it belongs to.  It's state property.  I can't just buy it and put it in your private garden.'  Then she said: 'But if you manage to triumph over the Russians you could make an exception just this once.' And it was really bizarre, you see, because conversations like that actually did take place, and then afterwards we would go back to discussing the best way to commit suicide.""  More important details also are offered, but most of what are offered therein can be seen in another film as well.  So, you just might as well be better off watching the new German film entitled ""Downfall: Hitler and the End of the Third Reich"" instead of this c-span-like interview on tape.  Mind you, what Hitler's former secretary has to say is often very interesting, but---let me give you a sample first: ""All of a sudden he [Hitler] opened the door of the conference room, walked into the anteroom, to his study and sent for us---I mean the women who were still there and he said: 'All is lost.  You must leave Berlin at once.'  His face was like a mask of stone.  In fact, it already looked as though he were wearing a death mask.  We stood there, completely stunned, and then Eva Braun walked up to him, took both his hands in hers and said: 'But you must know I'll stay with you.  I shall never leave you.' And then he leaned foward and for the first time that anyone had ever seen he kissed her on the lips.""  Interesting yes, but you can see it played out completely in the new film mentioned above.  The ""Downfall"" film, in fact, relies heavily on Frau Junge's recollections so you could just as well watch the film and skip this interview DVD.  Or, rather, borrow this interview DVD from your local library or rent it before seeing/buying ""Downfall"" (when it becomes available--it's still in some theaters as of april 2005).  ""Downfall"" is the film to see, in other words---Don't even consider this interview DVD without intending to see ""Downfall"" too, at least.  One thing this interview DVD (with absolutely no special features or extras) does have over the film I've mentioned way too often already is Frau Junge's use of the term ""Fuhrer"" to refer to Hitler at times.  For instance: ""...Otto Gunsche came up the stairs from the Fuhrer's bunker...""; ""...suddenly there I was, little Traudl Humps, sitting opposite the Fuhrer.""; Of Hanna Reitsch, the aviator: ""I never saw a woman greet the Fuhrer with such obsessive devotion...""  Admittedly, she does call Hitler a criminal too, as well as admitting having experienced guilt for having liked him, but it's ambiguous.  Once she heard that Hitler committed suicide she recalls: ""I felt such hatred for Hitler because he had abandoned us, a very personal hatred.""  Previously Hitler dictated his personal testament to her, in which she quotes him as saying: ""The struggle was necessary in order to prevent a worst fate and save the world [from Bolshevism].""  ""The German people were not ready for their mission.  So they must perish.""  Such murderous disregard for millions she seemingly puts behind her personal berayal, but that doesn't stop her from continuing to refer to Hitler as 'the leader'; ie., ""Fuhrer"" on more than several occassions within 80+ minutes of speaking.  Rather odd, I'd say; just that---and that's the only thing I think this interview offers that bests ""Downfall.""  Cheers!",1117843200,23,3912,4.758518518518518
1917092,5,B0000CABBT,"Blind Spot is a documentary showcasing a woman who saw Adolf Hitler in his most mundane and banal moments.  And, as ""Hitler's Table Talk"" lets us know, those moments were as boring and unsensational as they could possibly be (when not filled with deranged conspiracy theories).  There is only one star in the this movie, Traudl Lunge, and sometimes we even get to witness her watching herself on video from a coach in her apartment.  Blind Spot is the product of numerous interviews  conducted in 2001 with Hitler's former secretary, Traudl Lunge.  The only setting for the film is the inside of Lunge's Munich apartment so action lovers should be cautious.  The timing for the discussions turned out to be most fortuitous as Lunge died the following year.  She speaks to free her conscience and ease her sense of responsibility.  Yet, what exactly was she responsible for?  It's quite hard to say.  No source that I've read regarding her has been condemnatory.  She was a simple typist given a job with fantastic access to one of the most revolting minds and personnas of history.  The only complication is that Lunge really loved her Fuhrer as he was a personal father figure on top of being the nation's leader.  He became the father she never had.  This tortures her even though it would have been impossible for anyone not to have noticed the Chancellor's human qualities when stationed near him for so long a time.  Had he not exuded such qualities it would have been most unlikely that he would have been selected to lead a political party in the first place.

In Traudl Lunge we have a young woman who nondramatically ate, listened and typed with Hitler.  He preferred eating meals with his secretaries as they were non-threatening and did not have a contradictory information to impart in his presence. We learn, both throughout the film and particularly at the end, that Lunge suffered tremendous misery due to her having favorable impressions of Fuhrer at the time of her employment.  This is inappropriate in my mind as she was never in any position to know of the vast criminality that was committed by the NAZIs during the course of their reign.

The film might better be called ""tunnelvision"" as Lunge really only seemed to be intrigued about daily events concerning her during World War II.  In this way she was no different from any other 22 year old.  Her self-absorption may well have been her only real blind spot, yet, when evaluating those individuals who served the National Socialists, one must be careful not to forget that a person's worldview was completely crafted by the distortions of the regieme.  Their press was only a press in name.  The stories they produced were uniform and 100% propaganda.  It is quite likely that Lunge would have lived until May of 1945 without ever reading or hearing anything that was even remotely critical of Adolf Hitler. There were no opposition magazines or radio stations for her to have heard dissenting voices as there are for those of us in the present.  Her boss was regarded as the greatest living German and the second coming of Fredrich the Great.  Junge did not appear to have the faculties or perspective required to have rebelled against the dogma around her.  Paralyzing guilt, at least in her case, does not appear to have been justified; although certainly I would not say the same thing about the German people as a whole.

My only complaint about this documentary is a technical one.  We are never given a pictorial biography of Lunge for the purposes of background information.  Photos and past interviews were certainly available to the director as she was interviewed extensively for the old television series ""A World at War.""  If we were ""shown"" more about her life history, then the film could have been even better.  Yet, due to the topic and the ""rivetation"" of one's eyes, I must give it five stars anyway.",1117411200,17,3895,4.7844311377245505

1917094,5,B0000CABBT,"If this film did not show nearby your multiplex, don't be surprised.  Maybe it showed for a week at an arthouse cinema near your major university.  Or on a campus.  Traudl Junge is not a household name in America, where probably 5 of 10 people can't name the Vice President.
This film is not politically correct, but any citizen should see this movie.  It is in German with subtitles.  However, imagine your grandmother explaining how, as a young girl, she ended up being the personal secretary to one of the most notorious criminals (Verbrecher) of all time, who usurped the conscience of a society (i.e., he told them he would take on all responsibility for the actions of his government)...and the rest is black history.  Think of it as a film noir.  It is not entertaining, it is a tragedy.
However, there is nothing different except for a few changes in wording from the 50-years-post reminiscences of just about any young person who takes a job without thinking of the consequences.  They come back to haunt you.  What kind of company did/do you work for?  Or, like so many Americans, do you actually derive your income from the government, even if you aren't in the military.
I recommend watching this film with friends, and discussing it over a Beck's beer--which hasn't changed since it was standard cargo on Hitler's U-Boat Flotillas.  Or, perhaps, at a dealership of one of the major businesses that benefitted directly from the carnage of the third Reich--still on the Fortune 100.

1917096,3,B0000CABBT,"It's amazing to think that Traudl Junge carried a story of this much importance and - more than 50 years and counting later - no one had gotten her recounting on paper, tape or video.  So, kudos have to go to directors Andre Heller and Othmar Schmiderer for their persistence and their apparent ability to win Junge's confidence.
That being said, I was a little taken aback by the sub-par production quality of Blind Spot.  Obviously, Heller and Schmiderer were working on a shoestrong budget.  I respect that.  But in this day and age where Mac-based video-editing tools can make a director out of anyone and the full-length documentary has been raised to new heights by masters like Errol Morris, the quality of the product here is a bit disappointing.
I feel this is worth noting because it gets in the way of one's watching of the film.  The video seems blurry, the sound quality goes from lukewarm to - at points - muddled (in certain scenes, I believe they have misplaced the microphone), and the subtitles at times obscure Junge's mouth.
Also, Heller and Schmiderer have been undermined a bit by the film's marketers here:  the coverbox features shots of World War II-era events.  Some viewers (this one included) expected cutways to newsreel footage tied to specific events that Junge recounts.  For example, the story of the assassination attempt on Hitler - and Junge's memory of the injuries he sustained to his arm - would have been strengthened by splicing in the famous footage at the time of Hitler obviously favoring the arm and greeting new (and obviously terrified) Hitler youth conscripts.
All that aside, the world owes Heller and Schmiderer a debt of gratitude for getting Junge's story on film.  They obviously were playing against the clock here:  the brittle Junge was suffering from cancer and (as I recall) lost her battle the day before the movie's premiere in Germany.
Junge herself is a cipher.  Her view of Hitler is as a paternalistic father figure, seemingly detached from the horrific policies of the Third Reich.  Heller and Schmiderer seem convinced that the young, impressionable Junge was in so close to Hitler and his coterie, that ""she was in blind spot.""  Junge herself floats this view and the filmmakers and marketers have run with it.  Judging from the opinions on this review page and elsewhere, there is considerable debate over Junge's naivete.  It's a debate worth having, and we need to credit Heller and Schmiderer for initiating it.",1077840000,8,2482,4.890214797136038
1917097,2,B0000CABBT,"Traudl Junge was Hitler's personal secretary from December 1942 to the latter's suicide in his Berlin bunker in April 1945. Traudl shorthand recorded and typed Hitler's last testament, such as it was. BLIND SPOT is an unembellished interview with Junge prior to her death of cancer in 2002.
As might be expected, Junge denies having had any knowledge of the horrors of the Holocaust during the war years. You know what? I believe her. She comes across as having been but an impressionable and intellectually unremarkable young woman who was thrilled at being at the Reich's power center. Yet, she was too minor a functionary to be relevant in the Nazi hierarchy's decision-making process. This fact, and the shell of isolation and plausible deniability in which the Fuehrer and his sycophants cocooned themselves, makes her professed ignorance credible. And, if she lied, it doesn't really matter. Her filmed testimony here is the most minor of historical footnotes. The fact that she was dismissed as unimportant by both the Soviets and the Americans immediately after the war only buttresses that view.
During most of the film's 87-minute run time, we watch the interview, which apparently lasted several days. Occasionally, we see Junge review the tape of her own words, to which she adds further comment. It's as if she wanted to get her story right for posterity. Who did she think cares?
Except for the fact that Hitler didn't like wearing shorts because of his white knees, I learned little about the man, his near assassination in July 1944, his conduct of the war, or his last days in the bunker that I hadn't already read in more authoritative sources. Her most poignant memories are of the fate of Hitler's dog, Blondie, and the last days of the Goebbels children, who were poisoned by their mother because they ""wouldn't know how to survive"" after the fall of National Socialism.
BLIND SPOT records a non-event. I would perhaps have given it another star had Junge's words been accompanied by archival footage and photographs of that long ago time. But, there was nothing to make it more visually interesting, not even a photo of the young secretary at work or play to provide a bridge in time.
In a way, I feel sorry for Traudl, like an inoffensive moth left in darkness after the terrible flame around which it flutters has been thankfully extinguished.",1075680000,12,2367,4.905236907730673
1917098,2,B0000CABBT,"Traudi Junge never mentioned to anybody what she did during the Second World War. But the guilt wouldn't go away. That's because, as a 22-year-old woman, she was one of Hitler's personal secretaries, trusted to the point that it was she who typed up his last will and testament in the Berlin bunker. Documentary filmmaker Othmar Schmiderer and conceptual artist Andr Heller convinced Junge to tell her story and their film is as simple as it comes: Junge talking straight to camera, attempting to explain what she did and why. There are also snatches of Junge watching herself on film, commenting further on what she has said. A film that shows it is not just evil itself, but the ignorance of evil that can be equally destructive.",1075593600,7,731,4.7637795275590555

7998455,4,B0000CABBT,"A documentary made by Andre Heller and Othmar Schmiderer. The target interviewee is Traudl Junge or Traudl Humps; she was Adolf Hitler's secretary from 1942 to 1945 and recorded Hitler's last will and testament.

My copy is in full screen format color of Traudl sitting in a chair with some book shelving in the back ground. The focus is on her and not the books; however one or two do come in focus. We do know that she claims to have read Vikto Klemperer's Books.

Some of the documentary has problems with syncing the voice with the picture.

She speaks German slow enough that I can almost keep up with her. There are some German silent inter-titles that help I had to pause long enough to read.) I went through it a second time with English subtitles. There are only English, French and Spanish subtitles. German would have been a plus in keeping up with the real words and not paraphrasing. The length is one hour and 27 minutes.

Unfortunately Traudl spends more time Pooh-Poohing Hitler and not enough time focusing on the details of what she was working on. She also accused Hitler of being a vegetarian that did not imbibe or smoke. He even had white knees.

We do get a good rendition of the attempt to dispatch Hitler with a hidden bomb. This is the basis of the film ""Valkyrie"" (2008.) ""and the incident made him feel even more certain that he was on the right path...""

We get a general overview of the final days in the bunker where Blondie was dispatched.",1482710400,,1471,4.511278195488722
