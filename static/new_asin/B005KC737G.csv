8476715,5,B005KC737G,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like TNA, ROH, DragonGate, and NWA.  This is the first night of a two night event called ""All-Star Reunion 8"" which is one of their biggest events of the year as they try to load up the card with the biggest names available leading to various dream matches & reunions.

The main event for this show were members of the ""Kings Of Wrestling"" tag team facing each other for the P.W.G. Championship with Claudio Castagnoli vs. Chris Hero in a match that told the story of both men knowing each other so well due to being tag partners with the match getting very interesting half way through with the top rope breaking.  The P.W.G. Tag Team Championships were also defended by The Young Bucks (going under their TNA wrestling name of ""Generation Me"" including wearing Impact Wrestling shirts) defending the Tag Team Titles against RockNES Monsters that had it's mixed of high impact non-stop action such as high flying & submissions while having it's humorous moments.  Another standout match featured Alex Shelley going against Eddie Edwards in what was a good technical match but when a woman in the audience (who was wearing a ""Big Show"" shirt) yelled ""BORING!"", the audience responded while Eddie & Shelley had their own responses to her throughout the match.  Other matches include Willie Mack vs. Kevin Steen that was very competitive with some funny moments by Steen, the Fightin' Taylor Boys going against the reunited team of The Dynasty (Joey Ryan & Scorpio Sky), Kenny King vs. Chuck Taylor, reunion of Generation Next's Austin Aries & Roderick Strong vs. Cutler Brothers, and El Generico & Ricochet vs. Nightmare Violence Connection (Kevin Steen & Akira Tozawa) which for anyone who knows the ROH history between Steen & Generico got exactly what they expected in a intense hard hitting match right from the start as they started brawling & throwing fist to the point where the partners themselves had to separate Steen & Generico.

This was my first ever time seeing P.W.G. & they knew how to make a lasting first impression here as this was one of those shows that was a wrestling fans dream as you had a mix of everything from high flying to grounded technical to the matches having a clash of styles while having moments that you can laugh at with their the wrestlers or the chants from the audience.  I recommend.",1333756800,,2580,4.85
