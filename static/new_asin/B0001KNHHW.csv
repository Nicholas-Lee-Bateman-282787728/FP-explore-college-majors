A very relevant immigrant story in the light of our countries current situation; reading the long review above, i could not help thinking we could substitute ""islamic"" theocratic government, with ""christian"" and we would get something like we are seeing w trumps administration. it is not so much about the religion (though they want us to be distracted by/with that argument) as it is about the big oil money $$$, both then in Iran and now in the US.",1486252800,,571,5.021052631578947
8323854,4,B0001KNHHW,"I had been waiting to see this film for 2 years. Unfortunately, it wasn't available to the general public, only in select theaters.

I strongly recommend this film for everyone, especially those who can identify what many iranians went through during the Carter administration. It provides a creative snapshot of the struggle that iranians had to endure in America during the hostage crisis in 1979. The setting is at the height of the disco era in California (LA). Houshang (Mansour the singer) takes a chance with Sam ""the hustler"" & night club owner (Houshang Touzie) in the hopes of making more money as Sam's partner in the disco club. Houshang (Mansour) is persistent with the idea of making better money as a club owner than working in a grocery market with his uncle. A question of loyalty and betrayal unfolds among a time of ignorance and discrimination.

The entire cast of characters recipricate each other beautifully. Throughout the film, the english and farsi dialogue among the actors/actresses are mixed appropriately with the support of subtitles.

The night club owner, cleverly played by Houshang Touzie (Guests of Hotel Astoria, 1989), is famous among iranian audiences for his stage work as well as Mansour, who is  internationally recognized as one of the top persian pop singers of this generation. I've met Mr. Touzie on a personal level and his  personality is very charasmatic, which is clearly evident on screen.

If you watch the film closely, there are other notable actors & singers that are not known among american audiences yet very well known among the persian community.

The director, Babak Shokrian, takes the viewer back in time in recreating an era with fast cars, great disco hits and the infamous yet fashionable 70's attire. The dialogue is comical at times yet revealing. I found this film to be very entertaining and authentic. The DVD also provides commentary & insight on the film by the cast members.",1131321600,8,1948,4.993827160493828
