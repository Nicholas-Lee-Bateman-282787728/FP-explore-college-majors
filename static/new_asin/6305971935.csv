1102767,4,6305971935,"As implied in the name there is an experiment in Philadelphia (1943) to make a navel ship invisible to the enemy. The experiment goes beyond its parameters and sends the ship into the future. David Herdeg (Michael Par) and Jim Parker (Bobby Di Cicco) jump ship in the process. What will become of them? Will this time travel affect others and can they get back?
If not will they adapt?

It cannot hurt to have a relationship with Nancy Allen you may not want to go back.

The story is based on a real conspiracy theory to cover-up the real thing. Even tough there are records to show that the destroyer was nowhere near the aria at the time, that just fuels the fire for the conspiracy.",1504828800,3,686,4.393700787401575

1103173,4,6305971935,"This is definitely a B movie. The acting is okay, but I noticed at least one flubbed line.
They don't portray the 1940s very well. One of the first things I noticed is that all the servicemen's hair is way too long and bushy. Back then they would have been clipped nearly bald. I assume they did this so the main character looked attractive enough to ""modern"" eighties audiences.
Luckily only a very small amount of the movie takes place in that time period.

The main character acts more like a 50s greaser than a forties sailor. I'm also pretty sure they weren't calling it ""World War Two"" at the time.

The special effects are pretty cheesy as you'd expect. Still, the storyline is interesting and it has a good premise.
If you like cheesy 80s flicks or cheesy time travel flicks try this one. Try making it a drinking game. How often do they plug Coca Cola?",1451865600,3,861,4.443037974683544

1103273,4,6305971935,"In 1943, Dr. Longstreet's invention was about to be tested.  The device was designed to deflect an enemy's radar beams into hyperspace, thus making naval ships invisible.  But Longstreet was worried -  making an opening into hyperspace might be dangerous . . . .

If you are seaman first class David Hordeg, then you felt honored to have been assigned to operate the ship's radar deflection field generator.  The order was given, the experiment started . . . and then it went terribly wrong.  Having lost contact with Dr. Longstreet, you and your buddy try to shut it down . . . no dice.  Time was running out.  You and your buddy make it to the rail and jump overboard expecting to hit water . . . .

In 1984, Longstreet was older and perhaps wiser;  he had learned much from the 1943 disaster.  Taking precautions to prevent repeating the mistakes of the 1943 experiment, Dr. Longstreet was ready to test a new generator which was designed to protect an unpopulated mock-town from missile attack by deflecting the warheads into hyperspace . . . .

If you are Miss Allison Hayes, then you have fallen in love with the man from the past.  So when Dr. Longstreet told David what he must do, your heart skipped a beat!  But deep down, you knew he had no choice . . . .

Michael Pare and Nancy Allen do their best in this excellent Sci-fi adventure tale. In the 1940's the Navy tries to work up a machine that will cloak the ships.

This movie for me is what I consider one of the Michael Pare trilogy musts, The other two being Streets of Fire and Eddie and the Cruisers. Pare, coming off his stint on The Greatest American Hero was to the 80's as John Travolta was to the 70s, Even the character he played on GAH Tony Villicana was at the time, a modern day Vinne Barbarino. But Pare was going to be an action hero. Experiment, like Fire, was his foray into sci fi and for me, it works.

1103695,3,6305971935,"Nancy Allen herself shines in this movie but I don't think she and Pare had much chemistry together.

When this movie came out it was all the rage. Unfortunately it does not hold its own years later. The movie's special effects were average at best. The acting was so-so and the production, while interesting as a whole did not inspire me. I did like the recreations of 1940s America. They shot in the south for areas that were supposed to be Philadelphia. This is the perfect movie to be remade for audiences today.

My favorite line in the movie: ""I don't know if they have a telephone,"" David says. ""David, everyone has a telephone,"" replies Allison. I liked the ending of the movie. After retuning to 1943 to save the destroyer by turning off the time device, David returns to modern times and falls in love with Allison Hayes. What happens next? I don't know because I have yet to see the sequel.

Get this movie on DVD. It's not too bad. Michael Pare does a pretty good job at carrying the film. Unfortunately the chemistry between the two leads may well have been lacking.

1103698,5,6305971935,"THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT is a one hour and 37 minute color film with the time travel theme.  The film concerns an experiment conducted in 1943, which involves the cloaking of navy ships to prevent detection by radar.  But the experiment did not to expected, and the result is that one of the ships totally disappeared from sight.  Some of the people on the ship were injured or killed, and two of them Michael Pare (the handsome-looking one), and his friend Bobby Di Cicco (the ordinary-looking one) get transported to the future.  The pair land in the Mojave desert, where they become fugitives.  Eventually, they hijack an automobile driven by a girl (Nancy Allen) who is driving her old automobile on the way to California to seek employment.  They force the girl to drive.  There are some police chases, and the automobile tumbles down an embankment, and the trio winds up in a hospital.  The weather had been a bit severe, of late, and there are unexpected thunderstorms, with scary lightning, resembling the scary lightning bolts of WAR OF THE WORLDS, with Tom Cruise.  While in a hospital, one of the lightning bolts takes effect on Bobby Di Cicco, and he is transported back to the past, that is, to the year 1943.  Then, Michael Pare and Nancy Allen become fugitives again, and there are more chase scenes.  The pair eventually find their way to a gas station that was once owned by Michael Pare's father, and they admire an array of photographs displayed in the window of the gas station, and Michael Pare sees a photograph of himself posing with his father.  The photo was taken in the year 1943, or perhaps a year or so before that.  Michael Pare interviews the current owner of the gas station, and he is pleased and gratified to learn that his father's life-long dream of becoming a race car driver was fulfilled.  But Michael Pare is also heartbroken, to learn that his father had recently died.

Then, Michael Pare and Nancy Allen resume their automotive flight, and manage to locate Bobby Di Cicco, who at that time was about about 65 years old (the actor playing him is an old man).  Bobby Di Cicco is owner of a large grape vineyard.  But Bobby Di Cicco refuses to communicate with Michael Pare, because he hated the fact that he had been subjected to severe ridicule for his tale of being transported the future, and then transported back to the year 1943.  That said, Michael Pare and Nancy Allen become fugitives again, and are on the road.  SPOILER ALERT:  I will not write anything further about the plot, and so I will not spoil the ending for you.

NANCY ALLEN.  When I discovered this movie on YouTube, I told myself, ""Oh no, this is going to be just another time travel movie.""  But then I recognized the face of one of the actors.  It was Nancy Allen.  Nancy Allen plays a genuinely caring physical therapist in the excellent OUTER LIMITS episode from 1995, called VALERIE 23.  As with some of the color versions of the OUTER LIMITS, and also with some of the color versions of TWILIGHT ZONE, it is the case that VALERIE 23 is absolutely superb. And so, I made sure to watch THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT right away, and I was pleasantly surprised that her character in this movie is much the same as that in VALERIE 23, that is, a character who is caring, sympathetic, and patient.

COMPARED WITH OTHER TIME TRAVEL MOVIES.  For some time travel movies, the attraction is the glitziness and whiz-bang of being able to travel through time. This sort of attraction is found in TIME TUNNEL, a fine television show from the 1960s.  This sort of attraction is also found in THE FINAL COUNTDOWN, starring Kirk Douglas, Martin Sheen, and Katherine Ross.  But for other time travel movies, the main point is something totally different, namely, the yearning and nostalgia for an earlier and less troubled time, or a yearning to be with a loved once who has long been missed. THE FINAL COUNTDOWN has a striking similarity with THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT, because the time travel device takes the form of a vortex, and because the vortex sucks up navy ships.  But FINAL COUNTDOWN lacks in any humanity or nostalgia.  TIME TO TIME (2001) is another time-travel story, which dwells extensively on the ability of time travel to fulfill nostalgic yearning.  TIME TO TIME is one of my very favorite stories, taking into account all of the television shows and all of the movies that exist.  Other time-travel shows that are about nostalgic yearnings include the Twilight Zone episode WALKING DISTANCE, and the Twilight Zone episode A STOP AT WILLOUGHBY.

CONCLUDING REMARKS.  THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT provides excellent character development.  It has visual effects that are somewhat crude, now and then, being as the film was released in 1984.  Despite the well-worn theme of time-travel, it is the case that THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT has a unique plot.  The film cannot easily be characterized as being derivative of other movies.  I liked the chemistry between Michael Pare and Nancy Allen.  The acting was honest and convincing.  I liked the scenes taking place in the Mojave Desert, since I have made about 40 trips to this particular desert (Death Valley, Searles Valley, Panamint Valley, Mojave National Preserve), during the past three years.",1399766400,,5271,4.798226164079822

1103784,4,6305971935,"Watching this movie now, 30 years after it was made, actually seems to add another dimension of time travel besides the plot in the movie.  The hair and the cars are super noticeable.  It is actually a good plot, but the acting of the main character was weak and I found myself easily distracted by the mechanics of the movie itself and the quirks of the time it was made (gas guzzlers, stand-up video games and other reminders of the disco era).  There was a scene of the two leading characters pulling into a gas station and asking the guy who worked there to fill up the tank, too.  If that doesn't take you back, what does?  I saw another review of this movie which mentioned wooden acting by Michael Pare and I have to agree.  Some actors just seem to have a way to connect with the audience so you just like them, even if they are playing the villain (you just don't like them as much).  Not so much here.  Take out the just below average acting, the special effects that aren't as cheesy as those from the sixties (but still a little distracting) and you have a good plot and a movie that is worth the time spent watching it when compared with the many super-cheesy alternatives.",1392336000,2,1186,4.359090909090909

That was a lot better, but I just didn't remember the opening scenes being so dull and unimportant.  They were.  My first reaction, having not seen this for at least 15 years, was that the hair styles are straight out of the early 80's and not fitting at all for a sailor in the 40's.  I also recognized Bobby Di Cicco, who was one of the main characters in 1941 (which is far better) and wore the same sailor suit and had the same 1980's hair for a 1941 period film.

I think the action is pretty straight forward and the premise interesting.  The actor for David Herdig (a Patrick Swayze wannabe, but dumber looking), I found not nearly as believable as the earlier times I've seen this film....again, the blow-dried hair look of the 80's. Bobbie DiCicco was pretty well caught in the act of acting in the scene just after arriving in 1984. Overacting that is.  Nancy Allen is as hot as ever...and I can see why she was popular for that period...also appeared in 1941 and was hot in that too!!!  The story sort of grates on you after awhile because some of the actions by the guys make no sense and they don't do rational things half the time.

Either way, it's worth the watch, if you don't pay too much for this.  I can't comment on the DVD, but the Netflix version was clear as a bell with decent sound and had captions available.  Probably not worth a blu-ray price though...unless they can't come up with a cleaner copy on DVD.",1326844800,,1574,4.389655172413793

Special effects at the time weren't exactly Transformers quality nor was the director a Micheal Bay....but if you can look beyond the rotoscoped hand illumination and the cut layout in the worm hole scenes, make popcorn and grab a soda, your in for a treat.
Story is good as well as the acting although none of the actors are mainstream (or still around). Based on ""actual events"", the Philadelphia Experiment takes you through the events that happened while the battle ship was ""invisible"" on that fateful day in 1943.
The project was designed to cloak objects and make them undetectable to radar but intead, opened a wormhole to the future knocking off the main characters in the process, sending them to 80's.
The only thing I would have like to see to improve the movie, other than having it set anytime but the horrible 80's, is to make it closer to the story of what ""actually happened"". Although the government will not and probably never will admit to the experiment, the story and couriosity stands true. The thought of time travel or opening a wormhole is fascinating to all of us dorks and geeks out there, whether its true or absolute make believe.
Either way, its just a movie. Don't go in expecting it to change your life or anything but don't miss out on a great movie none the less.

Cathie, in his eye-opening book Harmonic 695, demonstrated that Einstein had actually COMPLETED his Unified Field Theory and that there was an unmistakable mathematical factor in successful atomic tests also correlating with UFO sightings - so much so that his life has treaded a very, very fine line that neither fellow UFO researcher Dr. Morris K. Jessup (appeared to have committed suicide, but the evidence points to murder) and likely even Nikola Tesla, whose death was in fact under equally mysterious circumstances (it's said by some involved with the project that he was killed for having knowledge of Einstein's reticence concerning application of the UFT and, recognizing just how dangerous the experiment truly was, sabotaged the earliest trials) apparently could walk.

In David Hatcher Childress' equally eye-opening book, Anti-Gravity and the Earth Grid, Cathie reviews legendary researcher Ivan T. Sanderson's 'Vile Vortices' as well as geodesic mapping by Buckminster Fuller and the Russians, going on to mathematically prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is a corresponding grid line running exactly between Philadelphia and the Norfolk/Newport News area which would have directly facilitated the event; by virtue of Tesla's groundbreaking work with interference fields and variable pulsed electrical current, the Eldridge and its crew could indeed have been teleported from Philly to Norfolk and back again as purported. As a last note, I can tell you that my own belief this experiment actually occurred was greatly reinforced by a chance conversation with a fellow co-worker some years ago whose father had worked closely with quantum physicist (his wave and matrix mechanics tenets directly related to Tesla's postulations) and master mathematician John Von Neumann (upon whom the movie's Longstreet character is more or less based).

Stewart Raffill, creator of uber-cheesy E.T. knockoff, ""Mac and Me,"" with the help of producer John Carpenter, takes on the old urban legend and makes a time travel movie out of it. Two sailors from the fated ship fall through a wormhole created by the experiment, and end up in the 80s.

The concept and action keep it afloat with some surprising cinematography, and entertaining action sequences dictated by it's chase elements. Of course, the real cheese comes towards the end, with a somewhat forced romance, a little bad acting, and a climax that could have been better. Of course what do you expect with a small budget in the 80s. What you do get is a prime candidate for a remake, and a creative cult classic from the 80s.

In 1943 an experiment on the U.S.S ELdredge goes terribly awry as the Navy tries to make the ship go invisible so that Germans will not detect it on radar. It does...but something has gone wrong as two of sailors jump ship and fall into some time vortex that lands them in 1984,in a town in Nevada that has suddenly disappeared! There are incredible storms brewing and everything is being threatened by this timewarping. The two sailors are shocked and confused by what has happened. They do not know where they are and what year it is. What is certain is that one of the sailors is electrically charged and seems to be linked still to the electromagnetic field. The two sailors ""kidnap"" a girl, and she becomes their link between the two time fields.

Corny? Yes. Exciting and provocative? Yes. For all of the obvious ""holes"" that this script has (I mean,c'mon it IS science fiction which is inevitable),this film never lets up with narrow escapes,car crashes,burning buildings and special effects that still look convincing enough even for the most sophisticated 2007 Sci-Fi officienado!

Michael Pare and Nancy Allen star as the two whose love will span the time zones. The fact that this film IS actually based on a true experiment makes this film all the more compelling. A ship DID disappear in the Philadelphia Harbour in 1943, and a man did reappear with the ship embedded in the deck! After that, who really knows.

1104313,4,6305971935,"Michael Pare never really made it to the big time, which is too bad, because I always thought he had what it took to be in the Hollywood big leagues. He was good looking, had that tough guy way of delivering his lines, and this no-nonsense demeanor. Yet, in his scenes, he unveiled a certain sensitivity and accesibility. He proved to me, with his movies, that he could emote well enough. In the 1980s, he starred in several movies which I really enjoyed: STREETS OF FIRE, EDDIE & THE CRUISERS 1 & 2, and THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT.

I love time travel stories and I had tremendous fun watching THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT. Supposedly drawn somewhat from true events in World War 2, this sci-fi film tells the tale of a WW2 naval experiment (an attempt to make our ships invisible) gone awry. The USS Eldridge, instead, vanishes, not only optically but physically. At the same time, Navy sailor David Herdeg (Michael Pare), along with his squid buddy Jim, are transported 41 years into the future, to the year 1984. They reappear in Nevada and are immediately attacked. I'll try to curb the spoilers, but I will mention that the experiment which began in 1943 is apparently still ongoing in 1984, and that this begins to influence the meteorological fields, in effect, giving rise to massive, progressively worsening electromagnetic storms, which could threaten the whole planet if left unchecked. David and Jim, with the help of a girl they shanghai, Allison (Nancy Allen), attempt to make sense of things as they continue to evade their pursuers. In the end, it all falls on David Herdeg to make things right. How will it end, and which world will he choose to be in?

So, watching this movie from a contemporary 2006 perspective, I couldn't help but notice a certain 1980s cheesiness inherent to this film, as well as the gap in special effects technology from then to now. Yet, there's something still fresh and charming about THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT. Part of it, admittedly, is nostalgia. I remember really liking this movie back then, and I undoubtedly re-screened it thru rose-colored eyeballs. But you can't deny the earnest acting efforts of the cast, especially of Pare and Allen. Pare plays David Herdeg as angry, hard-headed, and understandibly confused, yet his vulnerability is shown in several quiet scenes, as when he discovers the fate of his father and when he was saying farewell to Allison. Nancy Allen is sweetness personified as the trusting, kind-hearted Allison Hayes.

Part of the allure of a time travel story is the displaced traveler's reactions to the new realities of the temporal setting in which he finds himself. It was fun watching David and Jim try to fathom the workings of a modern vehicle, a color television, a Coke can, an alarm clock, etc . Not to mention, it must be weird watching a 1940s B actor suddenly as the current president (Reagan). The issue of time paradoxes isn't delved into, as much as barely skimmed. Oh, there are people from the past who encounter David in the future, but it was mostly ado about nothing much. The requisite chase scenes and gun plays are all here, of course. This isn't really a thinking man's movie, as much as an action film where you sit back, have fun, and try to suspend all analytical thinking. There are some holes here, but I choose to overlook them. It's entertaining, sci-fi, popcorn fare.

There's a sequel, PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT 2, which again showcases David Herdeg, but 10 years later after the events in this film, and with Brad Johnson, not Michael Pare, playing the Herdeg character. It's also worth checking out.",1160265600,5,3614,4.843042071197411

The film is supposedly based on an actual event, which has been shrouded by some degree of secrecy and conjecture, but did not involve time travel.

1104362,2,6305971935,"This is not meant to be a review of the movie per se. Instead, the movie and its reviews need some historical and scientific perspective.

 First, degaussing of naval ships started with the British early in World War 2. The Germans had developed mine fuses capitalizing on the magnetic fields generated by steel ships traveling through salt water. English scientists in the war department quickly developed degaussing coils for ships entering/leaving the areas around their harbors, where supply and war ships entered. The harbors and several areas in the North Atlantic were where the Germans had concentrated their mining efforts, and the initial shipping losses threatened to strangle the British supply life-line.

 There were several interesting developments in this regard, including surrounding each ship with de-gaussing coils, building and refitting degaussing internal to each ship, etc. Churchill's 6-volume series on World War II should be required reading, and the prose and style is something to relish.

 Second, ""secret"" U.S. Naval experiments are not going to be known to the general public, unless there is a major disaster that exposes it in some horrific way to a large population. If part of your body gets caught in a steel bulkhead, you can bend over and kiss your tutu goodbye -- permanently.

 Finally, Einstein's Unified Field Theory never made it to the TRUE ""Theory"" category. The ""theory"" was -- and is -- an effort by theorists to understand and explain Natural Laws using a common set of equations. This common set of equations is precisely what the ""Theory"" lacked -- and still does.

 Have fun with the movie, and remember that Hollywood types care more about whether it makes money (their real purpose) than they do about historical or scientific accuracy.",1113004800,4,1790,5.162629757785467

The special effects were very 1980's so you have to overlook that when watching the film.  There's a great sequence where Manfred Mann's ""The Runner"" is used for background music.  And a slight continuity error when the Porsche following (and eventually passing) our heroes disappears from the rear window.  And I have to wonder, since our hero is so important to the military's time travel experiment, why are they shooting at him? (duh!).  Oh well, makes for a little more exciting chase sequences.  And then there's that whole time-space continuum thing, what with the events as they play out.  Oops, better to not think about that stuff! LOL

1104366,4,6305971935,"""The Philadelphia Experiment"" is supposedly the about an experiment the U.S. Navy conducted in 1943 to make the U.S.S. ""Eldridge"" invisible to radar.  However, the experiment goes (surprise) horribly wrong and the ship is contaminated with a deadly dose of radiation.  Two of the sailors, David Herdeg (Michael Pare) and Jim Parker (Bobby Di Cicco), jump overboard as their crewmates are catching on fire and getting trapped in bulkheads and end up traveling through a rift in time to 1984 (i.e., the present in terms of that being the year this movie was made).  One of them gets sent back but the other does not and not only are the authorities after him but it seems that pesky hole in time is wrecking havoc with the climate (not as bad as ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" but serious enough).

This is a fun little B-movie that most science fiction fans can enjoy as long as they do not take it too seriously.  The reason it is considered to be based on a ""true"" story is that it is based on a 1979 ""non-fiction"" book that claimed the Navy was fooling around with Einstein's Unified Field Theory and sent the ""Eldridge"" from Philadelphia to the harbor in Norfolk, Virginia, and then back again.  The story is based on some dubious evidence and apparently since the U.S.S. ""Eldridge"" never ever docked at the Philadelphia Naval Yard the title appears to be suspect as well.  The Navy has offered an official explanation that what happened was a routine degaussing of the ship, which meant it was surrounded with electrical cables to negate the magnetic field (the idea is that it would render the ship invisible to radar but not to human eyes).  Of course to some people this explanation just screams cover up.

Ultimately this film is not concerned with the ""science"" of the so-called experiment because that is all just an excuse for a more traditional time travel story and within that genre there are few interesting things going on here.  There are some fun moments as Herdeg encounters the brave new world (Orwell's ""1984"" did not come out until 1948, so he does not know that the future is brighter than people had thought in the 1940s).  Herdeg hooks up with an airhead, Allison Hayes (Nancy Allen), who eventually comes to believe that he is not lying about when he is from and tries to help him get back home.  It is just as well because there is really no chemistry between these two.  After ""Eddie & the Cruisers"" and ""Streets of Fire"" we all thought Par' was going to have a career, but this film seems to have derailed it.  Come to think of it the same can be said for Allen, outside of the ""Robocop"" movies.

The special effects are rather simplistic, but quite effective for the time.  They were certainly good enough to lure more than a few people into seeing this film from director Stewart Raffill (""The Ice Pirates,"" ""Mac and Me"").  Plus you have the standard lesson than there are some things scientists should not be messing around with otherwise a wormhole will destroy the world as we know it, which was not really an omnipresent science fiction plot line at that point (CGI made destroying the planet much more fun).  There is a 1993 sequel to this film, but try to forget about it because it belongs on everyone's short list of worst science fiction sequels ever.  This one at least gives you some things to think about, not all of which are about how to poke holes in the story.",1085702400,18,3402,4.593388429752066
1104367,3,6305971935,"When it comes to time travel on the screen, there have been many, many attempts.  My favorite is the STAR TREK episode in which Shatner travels back in time, falls in love with Joan Collins, and she gets killed, and he has to leave her behind.

Somehow the same scientist who did the 1943 experiment is still at it, trying to make a town invisible.  In doing so, he opens a vortex that brings the two 40s soldiers to modern times.  Pare falls in love with the wonderful Nancy Allen (CARRIE, BLOWOUT, DRESSED TO KILL), and their romance is a key element in the eventual climax.
The special effects are commendable for a 1984 movie; the direction is adequate, and most of the performances very good.  Nancy combines her naivete with those lovely eyes to make a wonderful heroine, and Michael Pare shows a good range of emotion in trying to decide where he truly belongs.

It certainly piqued my interest in the paranormal, but at the time, I was unaware that the movie was based on alleged experiments by the US Navy.  It's a B-sci fi movie complete with silly exaggerations, decent special effects, general cheesiness and the inevitable romance that ensues - in this case between a skeptical Nancy Allen and a confused Michael Pare.  This movie is not to be taken very seriously.
If you are looking for mindless entertaiment, this is an excellent movie to satisfy your craving.  It may even spark an interest in reading further about the allegedly real Philadelphia Experiment.",1072656000,5,675,4.843478260869565
1104428,5,6305971935,I thought it was well done. Smoothly takes you to the impossible - finding yourself in another time. Believable.,1050883200,3,112,4.947368421052632

1104430,4,6305971935,"Because this film lacked real star power, not many people have caught this as they should have.  Even non sci-fi fans will enjoy this one.  No need for me to reiterate the plot.  The story is tightly crafted, well acted, and beautifully executed.  Everything is explained nicely and nothing left to confuse the viewer.  What is truly refreshing is the use of actual older actors playing the characters at later ages.  No latex for a change!
Word of warning:  If you order this used, be sure the version you are getting is produced by Anchor Bay Entertainment.  It's wide-screen and contains the trailer as an additional feature.  There is another version out there which is advertised as containing no features.  This one is put out by an independent distributor, is Pan & Scan, the picture quality is dark, very grainy, and sound poor.",1017446400,140,836,4.783216783216783
1104431,3,6305971935,"This is a good idea for a sci-fi adventure story. But the effects and quality were kinda [bad]. And there were some things that were kinda confusing and didn't make any sense. I like the idea of men from the past accidentally getting sent into what is considered the present to us. But their electrical connections were not necessary. That's what I thought at least. And there didn't need to be what was shown in the vortex hole. Plus what happened when they arrived. Being shot at by a helicopter and then it just all of a sudden blowing up. Also, the 40's was kinda boring and hard to follow with what was going on. But I see showing the pasttime was necessary to explain how men from there had in mind that all taking place was normal and arriving in the 80's all taking place was weird. But I also thought what was the point of having that one guy come through if he was going to get sent back so soon. This is an okay story. But if I had made it, I would have given it a lot of improvements I think are needed.",1005436800,,1015,4.157360406091371
1104432,3,6305971935,"I have always been fascinated by this true story. Yes, thats right, TRUE!. Of course in this movie, there was a lot of exaggeration. The ship really did disapear. but beyond that not to many people know what els happend. there are rumors of experimenting with time travle, and rumors that the ship reapeared in norfolk virginia, and the rumors only get bigger after that. But this did happen, My father worked at the ship yard and witness the generators being installed on the ship.
the year is 1943, and the navy is trying a new type of stealth technology for ships. It is supposed to make the ship invisible to radar. When the generators are turned on, the entire ship disapears from view. Meanwile, in 1984, the same technology is being used to make a deserted town dissappear. Somehow a rift is opened between the two times. Two crewmen jump of the ship and land in 1984. The two crewman get to experience 1984, but one of them is pulled back thought time. The rift will not close, the generators on the ship are still running keeping it open. when the other crewman is found, he is used to shut down the genorators on the ship. If you haven't seen this movie, it is worth watching. If you liked The Final Count Down, you will probably like this movie.",1004745600,5,1256,4.465217391304348
1104433,5,6305971935,This movie is more like a documentary than a movie (if you leave out the romance parts).  A classic !,990921600,2,101,4.05
1104434,1,6305971935,"I saw the second movie first and really liked it, so I rented the first one.  Big disappointment.  The story had almost no depth at all.  You really didn't get to know the characters.  There wasn't much of on the edge of your seat excitement.
Also, I noticed some things that didn't make sense- this movie didn't have much scientific logic to it.  For instance, the guys chasing the two time travellers needed them alive- yet they shot at them!  Further, even before they shot at them the two ran- when they didn't have any reason to.  And that older guy (won't say who) that knew what happened, wouldn't tell what happened for no reason that I can see.  These things and more were just to irritating to overlook.
But, there were some surprises and some paradox stuff that did make you wonder.  And there was time travel.  So, the movie wasn't a total loss.
And maybe I would have liked it better had I seen this one BEFORE the next one.
The sequel was really good- atlot more excitement and suspence, and more character depth.
The sequel was about a horrifying alernate reality created by time travel that the main character of both movies- I forget his name- was the only one who knew that this wasn't the way things were supposed to be. (He remembered the orginal reality)
It seems from other reviews that if a person likes one movie (1 or 2) they probably won't like the other.  But, then they are very different movies.",973036800,6,1424,4.48062015503876
1104435,4,6305971935,"The Philadelphia Experiment, based on a true story, was a military experiment in WWII. The idea was to make a battle ship, stationed in Philadelphia, invisible for the enemies and radars. But the mission failed and two sailers make a time travel in our present.
I like time travel science fiction movies. The movie has very good actors (Michael Pare and Nancy Allen), an exciting plot and an interesting soundtrack.
The executive producer was John Carpenter and you will remark his present in the movie making.",970358400,2,510,4.941860465116279
