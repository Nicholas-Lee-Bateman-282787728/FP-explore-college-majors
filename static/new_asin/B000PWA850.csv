8193564,1,B000PWA850,"This is an outrageous, over-the-top propaganda short from 1965 about how pornography is destroying America.

It's allegedly being brought to America by the communists for the purpose of destroying American values. (Go, commies! LOL!) According to this crazy film, looking at nudie magazines causes impressionable teens to become sadists, murderers, or worst of all, homosexuals! To illustrate how vile some of the pornographic literature of the error was becoming, we are shown dozens of pornographic images, and at one point the host spends about four minutes reading a lengthy passage from a novel about a teenager who longs to kill someone just for kicks. If such literature screws up those who read it, the narrator must have become one seriously messed up dude as a result of reading the smut aloud for this film!

This wackadoodle propaganda piece clearly failed in its goal of curbing the porn industry. In the years since ""Perversion for Profit"" was made, porn has become more explicit and more accessible (mainly because of the Internet).

""Perversion for Profit"" does for porn what ""Reefer Madness"" did for pot smoking 29 years earlier. If you want insight into hysterical propaganda, this film might interest you. It is so ridiculous it can be viewed for the purpose of contemptuously laughing at it, just as audiences have been doing for decades with the aforementioned ""Reefer Madness"".

Remember: this is a short film, not a feature, and it only runs 31 minutes. If you're ""on the fence"" as to whether you want to spend money to own this film on DVD, you can watch it in its entirety on Youtube first.

UPDATE 11/10/2015: I just watched this film again. I noticed at one point George Putnam claims there has been an alarming rise in the rate of ""illegitimate births"". To prove this, he holds up a chart which simply reads ""Illegitimate births"" with a jagged, diagonal line on it. That's it! The chart has no statistics, dates or numbers of any kind; just two words and a diagonal line! Anyone who buys into this type of propaganda is gullible enough to believe practically anything!",1433030400,,2096,4.909604519774011
8193565,1,B000PWA850,"Many people know of the old ""educational"" film Reefer Madness.  It's so outdated and exaggerated that it succeeds only to incite hilarity in those who view it today.  But last night on TCM, I saw a film that is so full of bold face lies and hateful misinformation that it is truly tragic.

""Perversion for Profit"" was produced in 1965, an unique time for Pornography, where one could purchase many different types of nudie magazines and stories of sexual encounters, but I'm pretty sure that there were not yet any magazines with pictures of people actually engaging in sexual acts.  It is remarkable then that the host of this short film states that looking at these nudie magazines will cause a man to go out and commit murder.  And he does so several times.  In the light of what we know today, that just sounds silly, but he also has several extremely hateful and totally incorrect things to say about homosexuality.  In fact, it's so bad that it is reasonable to assume that more than one gay man or lesbian could very easily have been murdered after a closeted, or homophobic, or religious man saw this film.

As truly bad as this film is in every way though, it is a good idea to see it now to learn how far we have come and what type of misinformation to totally ignore if anyone should ever attempt anything like this again.  But, I would NEVER recommend that a young child see it, and no matter how important this film may be historically, I cannot give it more than one star.  If even one gay teenager committed suicide, or even one man killed a gay person after watching this film, then it is literally one of the WORST films ever made.

Anyone who has not seen ""Perversion for Profit"" in a long time, however, really needs to see it again before discussing it with anyone or writing a review on it.  Some people, who have not seen it in a very long time might even think it disseminates accurate information and give it 5 stars.  And if they did, it pretty much proves my point, that they have not seen it in a very long time.

Also look at the reviews on IMDB for a LOT of enlightening, factual information on the producers, and more...

8193566,5,B000PWA850,"Those too young to have lived during the 1950s and early 1960s will laugh at the film.  Those who know about how poverty and the lack of the nuclear family impacts the lives of children will breathe a pain filled sigh.  As the rise of libertine culture affected society, countless other factors poisoned our current culture.  The greatest factor is a lack of knowlege of how to determine the truth and do one's own research.  Because our prevailing culture is the opposite of what it once was, most will not think for a moment that this documentary is relatively accurate, even though it somewhat overstated the case.  However, things are so bad now that any overstatement is now meaningless.  Food for thought, though few will take it seriously.",1365811200,3,746,4.7890625
