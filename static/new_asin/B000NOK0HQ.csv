2774574,1,B000NOK0HQ,My husband and I were really looking forward to this DVD only to be very disappointed.  It was not well narrated and very boring.  We could only stand to watch about 15 minutes of it.,1304294400,,183,4.2
2774575,2,B000NOK0HQ,The best disc is #4.  It is not overpowered by music and actually has informative information regarding the buildlings.  The other disc sound canned and only snapshots and loud music.,1262995200,3,183,5.066666666666666
2774576,4,B000NOK0HQ,"I'm kind of torn on this package and I really wanted to give it 5 stars.

One the positive side, the photography is stunning - you can really tell the director has a great passion for these historical landmarks and planned each and every shot with loving care & precision - there's nothing amatuer about the footage contained on this set.  The video & sound quality on each disk is consistently excellent.

On the other hand - one thing that really bugs me is the lack of information on the subject matter.  The narration is very inconsistent.  Some lighthouses get more background history while others get nothing more than an introduction.  I would like to have seen - or rather heard - more consistency in the narration.  Another thing I noticed was some reptition of material spread across the disks.  Footage seems to be re-used a bit.  Flawed as it is, I really like this set.  The images and music are very relaxing if you are in the mood to watch something that doesn't require too much brain activity.  It's a loving and beautiful look at some of our nations historical nautical landmarks.",1250467200,5,1098,4.637305699481865
2774577,1,B000NOK0HQ,This is the worst lighthouse video I have ever looked at.  Disappointed is the only way I can describe it.,1238976000,,106,4.3
2774578,5,B000NOK0HQ,"As a lighthouse enthusiast for many years, I was immediately intrigued by the packaging which offers an embedded speaker that emits the sounds of Sea Gulls, Waves and a Foghorn.  Very cool!  The five discs are all exceptional in and of themselves and offer absolutely stunning photography of some of my favorites; Pemaquid Point, Fire Island, etc.  All in all this is a great value for the money too.  5 discs in an emossed metal box for under $20.00?  For me it was a no-brainer.  Definitely should be part of anyone's collection.",1207008000,7,531,4.717391304347826
2774579,1,B000NOK0HQ,"I bought this movie because the case states that there is information about lighthouses from Washington, Oregon and California coast on it. Instead this DVD has a short history on a select few east coast lighthouses and the rest is just pictures of these lighthouses. Discs 2&3 contain the same information as disc 1 but have a few more pictures with music playing in the background. I would not suggest this DVD to anyone.",1204761600,10,423,4.72972972972973
8180039,2,B000NOK0HQ,Only spent minutes on each lighthouse with almost no screen shots of the interiors. I would not but this DVD set again.,1432512000,,119,4.454545454545454
8180040,4,B000NOK0HQ,"lots of very good information, great stories and history with really good pictures of the various lighthouses.",1419120000,,110,5.529411764705882
8180041,5,B000NOK0HQ,"Yes it was great,nice music, beautiful photography, wish it was more informative. would I recommend this to a frend, yes.",1383177600,,121,5.1
8180042,3,B000NOK0HQ,These are enjoyable is you like viewing many different lighthouse.  Would have been nicer is there was audio or more explanation of photos.,1359417600,,139,5.043478260869565
8180043,2,B000NOK0HQ,"I really like anything on Lighthouse, but I should have read the reviews on this, I thought it was going to ne like a documentory on the lighthouse featured. While some of iy was narrated, some of it was showing pictures of the light houses and it was a good thing I can read so I knew whre the lighthouses were located. I was really disappointed.",1358380800,,347,4.2727272727272725
8180044,5,B000NOK0HQ,I received this for a gift and got one for my friend.  I really like it.and it is so relaxing.,1357516800,,94,3.7
8180045,1,B000NOK0HQ,"We got this video for Christmas and watched it soon thereafter. We thought it was lighthouses of America but instead it was lighthouses of the East Coast. There are over 100 lighthouses in Michigan alone and not one of those is pictured. There were none of the West Coast lights included although the packaging said there was. The photography was lousy. The narration was inconsistent and provided little if any information for most of the lights. The music got annoying after a while. They spent 10 minutes or more showing the Portland Head Light, but skipped through a few others with hardly a mention.  We did not bother with Discs 2 & 3 since they mostly were repeat viewings of the lights on Disc 1. Ironically, Disc 4 has a Michigan light pictured (Au Sable), but not one mention of any Michigan lights or any of the Great Lakes lights anywhere on the DVD.
All in all a waste of time.",1356998400,,890,4.527950310559007
8180046,3,B000NOK0HQ,"The video was good and what naration there was, was OK. But it was mostly 4 hours of boring. To tell you the truth, I used the 30 sec fast forward button a lot. There were also some repeats which were annoying. But I bought it here on Amazon and got it dirt cheap so I don't feel too bad. And I have since donated it to a worthy cause.",1350172800,2,335,3.8
8180047,4,B000NOK0HQ,"This set of DVDs comes in a metal tin with the lighthouse on the cover impressed right into the tin for a raised surface. The container also has a button that activates a short audio of pounding surf and screaming seagulls. Very impressive. The 4 DVDs show helicopter views of the lighthouses and some up-close shots of historic details such as doorknobs and recessed windows. Photography is great. There is a commentary with historical details, but this only fills about half of the audio portion. The rest is very soothing music that adds to the relaxing views.  My tin came with a bonus CD of music and waves, but the sound quality and the music/surf combination were not pleasing. I likely will not listen to that CD again. One other feature that is a bit annoying is that although there are 4 DVDs, several of the lighthouses are included on at least 2 of the DVDs. Without this repetition, the lighthouses could likely have been put on just 3 DVDs.",1322352000,,954,4.6117647058823525
8180048,1,B000NOK0HQ,"Good: music is pretty nice.

Bad: The producers of this set should be ashamed at the absolutely horrible quality of these DVD's. This was produced in the era of High Definition and should have been shot in 1080p, but what the hey' a good DVD produces decent picture quality right? This is not a good DVD.

The presentation of the visuals is an absolute mess and quite literally defy's all human reason. It's a widescreen image framed in a 1.33:1 frame, and there are even black bars on the sides of the frame...WTH? Furthermore the original footage has hardly any sharpness, it's borderline blurry. Looks like a horrible VHS port. Bad.

Thankfully I got this as a gift. It's now in the landfill. Using the box to store my daughter's craft stuff.

Do not buy.",1320883200,,758,4.592592592592593
