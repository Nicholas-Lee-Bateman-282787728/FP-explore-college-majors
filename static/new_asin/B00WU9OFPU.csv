The series managed to take the viewer through numerous ups and downs in the main character's life without being soap operish.  No matter how many times I watch it, I still find myself getting emotionally involved with the characters.  Christopher Casenove is wonderful, as are the other actors in the regular cast.",1494979200,,433,4.72
