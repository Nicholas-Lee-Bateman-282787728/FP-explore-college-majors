3965884,5,B002PTVMX8,I saw this program on TV and liked the way and amount of material that they covered;they had things in this program that I had not seen before and I have watched alot of JFK material so was happy to see it out on DVD; so that I could add it to my collection of history.,1307404800,3,269,3.8214285714285716
3965885,3,B002PTVMX8,"As the title suggests, this DVD covers the first 24 hours after JFK was assassinated. The events are shown in chronological order; first in minutes, then hour sections. The historians/authors constantly put their own spin on the presentation of facts for dramatic purposes, which detracts from the program. It is therefore not presented, overall, in an objective fashion. They try and go inside Robert Kennedy's and Lyndon Johnson's heads and surmise what they were thinking at different points in time.

It opens at thirty minutes before the assassination. It shows the famous ""Zapruder film"" footage and the race to Parkland Hospital and events therein. The narration is inter-cut with voiceover's by Secret Service men and Lady Bird Johnson. The program shows the large amount of confusion and shock that was occurring, thereafter. The one who comes shining through all of the events is First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy. She leaned over and covered her husband's body after arrival at the hospital. The only time she left his side was when JFK was in the OR. Johnson is finally told at 1:10 PM was has happened to JFK. The fact the Secret Service men and JFK advisors had to basically ""steal"" JFK's casket in order to leave the hospital is like a ""dark comedy"", which sadly was true. After that the anger, tension and bad blood between Lyndon Johnson and Robert Kennedy is shown. It is this section and that relationship that contains the most drama, speculation and conjecture by the historians of the show. They state everything as fact, but it is more POV pushing.

In the end, the best part of the program was the information gleaned from the notes by respected historian, William Manchester from 1964-1965 generated originally for his tome, ""The Death of a President: November 1963"". A book that hopefully will be re-printed over the next few years as the fiftieth anniversary of the assassination draws near.",1299110400,11,1915,4.98125
3965886,5,B002PTVMX8,"The Kennedy Assassination: 24 Hours After was broadcast on the History Channel in October 2009 as I recall.  This program details what really took place during the 24 hours immediately after the shooting in Dallas.  The program focuses mainly on the difficult position Vice President Lyndon Johnson was in and the difficult decisions he made during those 24 hours and beyond.  Focus is put on the events inside Parkland Hospital, the actual time of Kennedy's death, the well-being of Jackie, as well as the time before, during, and after Lyndon Johnson took the oath of office aboard Air Force One.  The bitterness and tension between Lyndon Johnson and Robert Kennedy is also explored.  The Kennedy inner circle had criticized Johnson's behavior during this time, but the guest historians on this show stick up for Johnson and defend the decisions he made.  Whether or not you agree with these historians in sticking up for Johnson is up to your own judgement of the material presented.  Check out how Johnson was ""snubbed"" by the Kennedys after arriving in Washington that evening.  Fascinating stuff.  Voice recordings of Lady Bird Johnson add an additional dose of drama to the material presented.

This is a very good documentary to watch if you want to know a lot of what happened that day that you never knew before.",1296000000,6,1323,4.918918918918919
3965887,4,B002PTVMX8,"This is a documentary about the hours after JFK was shot and the actions LBJ took to assume the presidency. No matter what he did, he would have been critized by someone. In the end he probably did the right thing given the tumultuous times. No one was sure whether the Soviets were behind the assassination and if this was the beginning of WWIII. The US needed a strong man to take control and let the world know we would not sink to the level of a despotic nation whose government couldn't survive such a catastrophe. Jackie was criticized later in life for marrying a foreigner, but her demeanor during this time was amazing. Poor Ladybird was caught in the middle-wanting to comfort the widow but needing to stand by her husband as he assumed his new position. Conspiracy theorists may not enjoy this so much but it does capture the bitterness of RFJ and the JFK camp.",1281052800,8,872,4.525316455696203
3965888,5,B002PTVMX8,As a Kennedy buff and collecter of most things Kennedy I have to say that this DVD is teriffic. Condition better than expected. Shipping time was minimal. I highly recommend this seller to others.,1280448000,,196,4.794117647058823
3965889,4,B002PTVMX8,"The transfer of power -- some still call it a coup d'tat - when JFK was murdered and the 40 minutes before LBJ took office and then the following turbulent 24 hours, still fascinates with its many reverberating questions and expressions of mutual distrust.  The true story of the violent transition has only been partially told.  Now, with never-before-seen transcripts only recently made public, startling new information about the death of the president including new details about when JFK actually died and the truth behind Vice President Johnson's famous oath of office photo on Air Force One can be shown.  Who was really in charge?  This is a great documentary -- dramatic, compelling, almost Shakespearean in its unfolding.",1270944000,28,731,5.169491525423729

3965896,5,B002PTVMX8,I used this with my gifted 8th graders to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy Assassination. My students were enthralled by the history presented--and it was comprehensively presented. Its unusual to see 100% of any group of 13/14 year olds totally absorbed in a history documentary but this one had them totally hooked. Will continue to use this as a teaching tool in years to come.,1398038400,2,395,4.91044776119403
3965897,5,B002PTVMX8,Watching it right now. Tidbits that have not been released in other videos. The movie is worth watching for any Kennedy fan.,1397260800,,124,4.681818181818182

3965900,1,B002PTVMX8,"Sorry, but this was pretty biased in how badly Lyndon was treated by the administration. Wondering how much is truth and how much propaganda. If you want a really good DVD on this matter, check out the National Geographic one with the Dallas ABC Affiliate reports. Amazing stuff there, things that were kept quiet for 46 years.",1387238400,,327,4.754385964912281
3965901,5,B002PTVMX8,"On Australian TV last week late Oct. 13 I viewed a program made by Australia/Canadia whoich questioned the ""Smoking Gun. To cut a long story short they said at the end that the 3rd shot coming from the back was fired by a Mr. Hickey a Secret Service agent who was supposed to take care of the president. He fell back in the open car 2 behind and accidently hit the President that is why there was such an incredible cover up over the past 50 yrs. The third shot when contacting the head exploded.
I was always of the opinion whether on purpose or not his own killed him. I do believe compared to Arab Countries Americans have many freedoms but to be honest their Govt. tells them little and I wonder exactly what the White House is a front for. Personally I believe after the death of  their president just a few months prior to the conclusion of WW2. All presidents since are questionable as to whether they are really in control. Who runs America? What propaganda do they use? Their Foreign Policies are Questionable!!! Have any of you seen ""American Empire"" Interesting. I am interested in Kennedy but for the life of me why did they go after the Mafia who their father bought to give them POWER? Did they JFK and RFK not know about what Daddy was doing ? I feel for JFK I do not believe he ever really wanted to become President and Teddy was wise to not run.",1383609600,,1363,4.32421875
3965902,5,B002PTVMX8,"For years, we have heard about the assassination itself, the magic bullet, the book depository, and the zapruder film.  But we have heard very little about what happened afterwards. All we have ever seen was how the patsy was caught and killed.  Finally my quest for knowledge is fulfilled.  The history channel has done an incredible job of showcasing the events. I was enthralled with the program from start to finish. I originally saw this documentary on the history channel and bought it afterward. I read some of the reviews and found that most were correct. I only disagreed with one particular review which stated the documentary made Johnson look like a hero and that it was biased into making Johnson look like he saved the day. I personally feel the opposite is true. Before I saw this program I was ok with Johnson, but afterward I felt completely different about him. I felt he was the most conceted, self centered jerk who had delusions of being all powerful and manipulated the situation to his own benefit. I will give you an example.  Johnson insisted Jackie leave the casket to come upstairs and forced her to stand next to him while he was being sworn in as president. Jackie still had brain matter and blood all over her. She was in shock after watching her husband murdered. However, instead of sending for a doctor to tend to her and getting her clothes and toiletries so she could wash herself, he asked for a judge and the press so that  he could get a picture of himself with her and gave his reasoning as he wanted to assure the country that everything was ok. No one who has ever seen that picture would ever form an opinion that it was good to see jackie that way. That, in my opinion was a big fat lie. Forcing the First Lady into a photo op in those circumstances nowadays would never ever happen. If it did, public opinion would have blasted the new president right out of office. I only wish it went farther than 24 hours. I apologize if others out there totally disagree with my view. It is of course my opinion.  I guess it depends on what you thought of Johnson before you watch it. The documentary was not biased one way or another per say, it stated the facts. However the people interviewed did state their opinions and yes, most of those comments did tend to show Johnson in a bad light.  But remember, they were there, in parkland hospital and on that plane when it took place.  But then whose views are the most believeable? The people who were there? Or the spin doctors who, over the years have helped to form what public opinion should be?  Whatever your opinion of Johnson, this documentary should not be missed. It is by far the best documentary I have ever seen on Kennedy. Well done history channel.",1372896000,,2746,4.509054325955734

3965905,1,B002PTVMX8,"I just watched The Kennedy Assassination 24 hours after TV - I lost all confidence in your story when I saw that the casket that JFK's body was loaded into Air Force One in Dallas and then unloaded in DC was not the same casket you repeatably shows as on the plane during the trip back to DC - The casket you showed being loaded about half way through show and then unload was a medal round end casket, probably a 48 once solid bronze sealer casket - the one you repeatably showed on the plane, even a close up on it with a broken end handle was a square end wood casket - on funeral day JFK was back in a round end casket, you could see it under the flag - next time spend a little money on a technical adviser and maybe your store will be more believable - anybody that switch caskets would also make up things just to make the store sound good",1361059200,,846,4.041666666666667

 You gain great insight to the assassination, what johnson, had to gain, and how
our country was stolen from us, by the rich and powerful war mongers.

3965911,2,B002PTVMX8,"Interesting on the surface. But as one gets toward the conclusion you find it's real point of view is to bolster Lyndon Johnson's standing in the minds of the American public. His manipulation of events on Air Force One is acknowledged, thankfully, but his back at Washington movements is given a damned if you do-damned if you don't slant. What is not acknowledged is that Johnson was on the brink of being arrested and having his whole political career flushed down the toilet right before the assassination took place or that he was going to be thrown off the ticket in the upcoming election. To those who think that Johnson was in on the ""shenanigans"", the section of Johnson at Parkland being kept in the dark as to what was going on will seem ludicrous. For a program that deals with the 24 hr period after the assassination, minute by minute and hour by hour, the controversial autopsy is  barely mentioned. I did find one of the on camera interviewees smiling and beaming as he talked about Kennedy's death jarring until the final moments when I realized that this was practically a tribute to Lyndon Johnson, who  I paraphrase) ""did the best he could under trying circumstances"". They promote his approval rating while the country was grieving together at an astounding 79% etc etc  but basically lay blame on Johnson's standing in history in that he wasn't Kennedy. No other explanation is explored. The History Channel in the last few years seem to be on a Johnson kick. They pulled the last THREE episodes of THE MEN WHO KILLED KENNEDY at the behest of the Johnson family. Maybe this program was their atonement for daring to air that final episode of THE MEN WHO KILLED KENNEDY. Who knows...?",1317427200,26,1705,4.714765100671141
3965912,4,B002PTVMX8,"This is an excellent historical review of what happened in the hours following the Kennedy Assassination.  This would have a very grounding effect on anyone who was too young, or not yet born, in the early 1960's.  This documentary presents the facts of what occurred and the play out of those events on a personal level for both the Kennedy and Johnson families before the blurring effects of Camelot took root.  It also shows what can happen when a personal tragedy collides with the running of Government and the confusion that occurs as a result.

This documentary is excellently produced and priced.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know what happened during the 24 hours after the Kennedy Assassination and how the personalities of those involved played out.",1311552000,8,776,4.893129770992366

There isn't any new information here, but it was still an interesting documentary regarding how the Kennedy Administration despised Johnson and treated him with complete disrespect even after becoming President.",1522281600,,391,5.409836065573771

8377316,1,B002PTVMX8,"This film isn't worth the plastic it's burned on!  It's a complete white-wash of Johnson's involvement in the assassination.  I knew where the film was going as soon as they repeated the Warren Commission's lie about the head-shot coming 'from the rear' - (even as they ran the Zapruder film clearly showing the shot coming from the front and exiting from the rear of Kennedy's head!)  And when they showed the doctored (and now discredited) photo of Oswald holding the gun, I knew the film was fabricated and planted to counter the other SERIOUS documentaries that REALLY DO expose the truth. Don't waste your time and $$ on this trash - it's a sham.  If you want to know what really happened, look elsewhere.  There are far-better documentaries and books on the subject, including those done by the British, as well as other serious American investigators who have the courage and integrity to tell the truth...and they have the EVIDENCE and WITNESS INTERVIEWS to back-up their claims.  This film lacks both.  Bottom line: Kennedy's assassination was facilitated by his own government in a coup d'etat.  There has actually been plenty of evidence available to make an informed judgment and arrive at this inevitable conclusion. To my shame, I (like far too many of my fellow citizens) just refused to examine it for 50+ years.  To those private citizens who did the long, difficult (and dangerous) work of bringing to light the facts about what actually happened, I can only convey my deepest gratitude and respect.",1490227200,,1517,4.91764705882353
