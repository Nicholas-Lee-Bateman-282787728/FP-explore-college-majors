8097737,5,B000CCZR8Q,"While neither as emotionally enriching as Lewis's presentation ""First World War: The Complete Series,"" nor possessing the gravitas of Ryan's ""The Complete Story: World War I,"" ""Trenches: Battleground WWI"" nevertheless provides a broad, easy to follow narrative of the major events of the First World War. Of the three series, I found this one the best organized and easiest to follow. There is a lot of good information here.  The narration is well written and adequately delivered, if uninspiring.

Particularly compelling are the personal interviews of WWI veterans, which, judging by the age of the veterans (early/mid 60s), took place in the early 1960s. On the down side, some of the interviews were recorded at a very low volume and thus difficult to hear.  As there is no cc this may be an issue for hearing impaired viewers.

Make sure you don't make the same mistake I did and purchase ""World War I: The War to End All Wars"" along with this one as it is a markedly inferior redubbing of this series.  Other than these caveats, solid.",1425427200,2,1042,4.831460674157303

8097740,4,B000CCZR8Q,"This review refers to the MADACY ENTERTAINMENT 5-disc DVD release.

I was impressed with the quality and variety of the archival footage used in this documentary. The vast majority is stuff you most likely have NOT seen before and almost all of it is in very good condition. A spall percentage is that grainy, copy-of-a-copy newsreel-type stuff we're all familiar with, but most of it is remarkably clear and looks like vintage home movies. This alone makes the set worth buying in my opinion.

The narration is well-written and informative, compressing multiple complex events into an understandable senior-high level. To be sure, there is some neccesary simplification, but it has not been ""dumbed down"" or sacrificed anything of consequence. The narrator reads the script well, in a polite, conversational tone that never becomes stentorian or academic (nothing kills a documentary film faster than a narrator that sounds like he's reading a script or delivering a lecture).

Some reviewers have commented that the footage often does not match with the narration. This is true to the extent that this documentary uses ONLY period film footage and -unlike today where every non-news event is documented and stock footage exists of everything- not every aspect leading up to the war was filmed, nor was every battle scene documented at the time. It is therefore to be expected that occasionally the narration will be have to be backed with some sort of generic film footage (like a random city scene or a generic view of farmland, or of troops marching).

This also hold true for the charges in other reviews that footage is repeated. It is often neccesary that some footage be repeated because other footage simply does not exist. The important thing to remember is that the vast, vast majority of this footage has not been seen before; or if it has, not to the point of cliched familiarity (like the Normandy Beach footage from WWII).

On the whole, this DVD set is well worth getting for anyone seeking a reasonably priced introduction to the epic pageant that was WWI.",1278374400,8,2073,4.962536023054755
8097741,1,B000CCZR8Q,"CONS

- A lot of scenes are repeated. For example, the scene where the allies troops got out of the trenches and charged.

- There are many times the narration and the scenes shown don't match! For example, the narration was talking about fighting but the screen was showing some royal figures walking or riding!

PRO

- The picture is a vintage film. It's not a re-enacting.

- The metal box is durable. I gave it to my mom to store other things. I gave the movie to my acquaintance.",1186531200,5,484,4.333333333333333
8097742,4,B000CCZR8Q,"This was my first experience with the World War I on DVD, and it was a splendid introduction.  It is divided into eight ""Episodes,"" including a discussion in Episode 5 about the role of air power and pilots.  Most effective for me were the segments dealing with Neuve Chapelle, the ""bleed them white"" offensive, Gallipli, and the sheer madness of Passchendaele, which was covered as one Episode, and Verdun, which rated several.

Almost a century later, I felt a sense of pride when Pershing and the Yanks arrived midway through the final episode.

The narrative stresses the Schlieffen plan and blames the generals for the mindless spilling of blood, two theories I've read have been rebutted by Strachan, but this set piqued my interest enough that I have ordered Strachan's The First World War - The Complete Series DVD set and his book, The First World War.

The accompanying video is often repetitive, and I found myself wondering if the locations were the ones being discussed at the time, or if they were merely stock footage.  I'll be haunted by a particular scene with a soldier carrying a corpse down a trench on his shoulders.  He looks up at the camera as he nears.  It a touching scene, but it will be with me for a while probably because they repeated it about a dozen times.

Still, the background music is classical, though it sometimes obscures the narrator's words.  And I found myself having to lean close when one of those who fought, interviewed much later, spoke.

I very much enjoyed this set, and I hope it served as a decent preface to Strachan's work, familiarizing me with battles, leaders, treaties, and generals.  I recommend it for that purpose.",1161820800,15,1675,4.757785467128028
8097743,3,B000CCZR8Q,"This was a fairly good overview of the first world war, but I was very dissapointed that it never even mentioned the Canadian victory at Vimy Ridge, one of the key battles of the war and very little mention of Paschendaele, one of the bloodiest battles of the war, but used nearly one entire disc on the American contribution.",1151366400,7,326,4.5423728813559325
