8055236,2,B0008191Z6,"As I said before I love this anime, it's amazing. I am not putting down this anime with my review, I am just saying skip over this volume to buy because all it contains is three eposides with the samething. This one big fight. Main thing, group goes to bowling alley to relax and oh no, the bad people come. Pink haired girl takes the hot big breasted chick while Aya is taken on by this creepy looking man. Boobies are shown, pink haired girl is actually fat, the other guy with brown short hair who is silenet but violent beats the crap out of all the goonies who are sent to destory them. So the president of the bad club comes, the other guy's bro and he's all hot looking but all you see is the other's reaction and end of volume! Okay so now you don't need to buy this volume, go buy volume three, TERRIFIC VOLUME! ^-^ I apologize for not knowing any of the names, I have a terrible memorey.",1133740800,5,897,4.160919540229885
8055237,2,B0008191Z6,"After going through some rough beatings in the last volume, the gang goes to a bowling alley to relax. Too bad for them, the Student Executive Council, the official power of their high school, sends ""Executioners"" to put the upstart Juken club in its place, and that means Maya, Aya, Takayanagi, and newest members Nagi and Bob. All 3 episodes follow a series of one-on-one, and in Takayanagi's case one-on-fifty battles for survival, as the Juken Club must battle its way out of the bowling alley.

This would be a good action show if only the action was done with quality animation instead of the usual ""cheats"" used in anime. We have lined backgrounds faking motion, blurred and distorted punches to save money and scenes where it looks like someone is just physically pushing a cell slide across the frame. When the characters fight, Tenjho Tenge looks really cheap. If the motion is going to be so limited, you might as well just read the manga. Most of the characters suffer from American comic buffness, sporting muscles that even atomic steroids could not construct. And the supposedly powerful leader is pretty comical too, with the body of Baki the Grappler, but with the hip swagger of a woman. This Round just left me flat.",1129334400,,1235,4.771028037383178
8055238,4,B0008191Z6,The whole DvD takes place in a bowling alley. And They get into a couple of good fights with The VICE PRESIDENT and the EXCEQUTIONER. theres a good fight with the captian and the vic president which is an awsome cat fight and is pretty good.,1126828800,,241,4.260869565217392
8055239,4,B0008191Z6,"The second volume to the Tenjho Tenge series has just as much action as the previous installment.  The Juken Club is attacked while they are taking a break at the bowling alley by Executive Council.  The fight scenes are great, and I can't wait for Volume 3.  The only reason why I am giving it four stars instead of five is because this volume only has three episodes as opposed to four in the first.",1124841600,2,401,4.32
