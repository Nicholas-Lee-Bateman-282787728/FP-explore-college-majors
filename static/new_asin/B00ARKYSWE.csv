8556879,3,B00ARKYSWE,"These are rarely seen and/or available short films by a wonderful physical comedian; owning these rates 5 stars in my book.  However, the transfers are of moderate to poor quality (some look like transfers from degrading VHS copies), which is unfortunate.  If you are a collector of physical comedy I recommend this, but in this digital age of film restoration, well, you get what you pay for in this case (which is not unreasonably priced for what it is).
This is the first of these Alpha video silent film comedian DVDs that I've purchased.  My expectation for all the rest is greatly lowered.",1433721600,,595,4.757281553398058
