8273885,4,B0019DAQ10,A light hearted extremely funny experience joining a group of ladies working in  the canteen at an english factory.  Once you have tuned in to the accent it is a laugh a minute.  Thoroughly recommended,1297728000,,201,4.685714285714286
8273886,5,B0019DAQ10,"Never ending laughs in this classic British situation comedy series.  If you are not British then you may need to pass on one or two of the jokes (or do a little research!) as they are pretty subtle and very British but you cannot fail to appreciate the riotous humour of the everyday events that cause such workplace chaos. The typical British understatement is at the heart of the script. The talented cast make the most of every written nuance, with guest appearances by such well known English veteran comedians as Thora Hird, Eric Sykes and Dora Bryan. Victoria Wood at her writing best - not to be missed!",1256515200,,611,4.605504587155964
