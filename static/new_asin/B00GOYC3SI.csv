6097552,5,B00GOYC3SI,"Finally, a great quality version. I've been waiting for this since I saw it on Toonami as a kid. Great quality, extras include stuff about the show and game (which I never knew existed). Totally worth the 20 something I paid for it.",1405468800,3,232,4.4186046511627906
6097553,3,B00GOYC3SI,"I'm of mixed emotions about this series. I'm in a strange place of not being able to recommend the series, but, I also cannot dis-recommend the series.

Basically we have a post-apocalyptic crapsack world where 'the bugs' have ruined the ecology and human civilization. The story, for one of these type stories, is compelling enough but nothing about the series is memorable, neither story nor characters. The typical Japanese anime messages encapsulated in the two Japanese words 'ganbare' and 'nakama' are the main plot drivers, with a touch of personal redemption tossed in. For those not familiar with these words, 'ganbare' has several meanings ranging from 'good luck' to 'do your best'. There is also the subtext of 'do your best, even if you fail, we will still love and respect you simply because you did do your best'. It is a complicated thought to get across to non-Japanese. 'Nakama' is also slippery, it is usually translated as 'allies' but it goes deeper than that, 'allies to the end, together against all adversity, we are family against the world and for that we will succeed'.  Oh dear, this is turning into a lecture on Japanese culture and anime. Sorry. Sort of.

The art is crisp, the animation clean and the voice work adequate, but like I said earlier, this is just not a memorable series. I wasn't bored or distressed watching it, it just didn't make my heart go zing!

And for that I can't recommend the series. It is considered a classic and for an anime completionist it may be a satisfying addition to your collection, but after you watch it it will collect dust.",1404172800,11,1593,4.760869565217392
6097554,5,B00GOYC3SI,"Quick sum up:
-Great, underrated classic anime film
-its definitely HD theres no doubt, but it could be a little better (just a little!)
-has extras and goodies to complete your Blue Submarine No. 6 experience
-buy now!
I am VERY satisfied with my purchase, this is a great old school anime. I just feel that the video quality is a little sub-par for a 1080p HD blu-ray, also it isn't full/wide screen. I think this film has such beautiful scenes and vistas (submerged cities, ocean landscapes, ports, tundras, abandoned buildings, post-apocalyptic urban landscapes) which is why I want the animation detail to be of utmost quality and perfection. This film definitely needs a high quality remaster and the uncensored dub for that true cinephile experience.
It also has a few extras like tv commercials, commentaries, and video game scenes from the Sega Dreamcast game of Blue Sub No. 6 (the Sega Dreamcast ceased production 13 years ago in 2001...I wasn't kidding when I said Blue Sub No. 6 was old school!)",1400025600,10,1008,4.866279069767442

6097556,5,B00GOYC3SI,"I saw this anime back when Toonami was on during the day, even though it was edited then for TV reasons, and I had gotten it on DVD previously, but now that it is on Blu-ray and is all on one disc it's so much more convenient! Definitely an anime worth having!",1394236800,6,260,4.019230769230769
6097557,4,B00GOYC3SI,"The movie is the Japanese version meaning it doesn't have parts cut out when it was aired for toonami, however the movie is not 16:9 ratio meaning its not widescreen. I don't know if they did this on purpose to keep the movie original but I'm kind of disappointed because the reason you buy bluray is not just for the audio but for the picture quality. Overall the movie was great.",1390521600,3,381,4.380281690140845
8625839,5,B00GOYC3SI,"This is probably one of the only anime I can think of that has ecological themes, but directs them at the sea, not the forests. In the future, a scientist named Zorndyke became disillusioned with human arrogance, and created an army of fish chimera that are terrorizing humanity. And his forces have melted the polar ice caps, flooding much of our present world, not to mention there are rumors he has plans to destabilize earths magnetic feilds that may wipe out humanity as a whole. It's certainly an interesting take on Global Warming, that benefits sea life. However not all is as it seems. The story starts with Kino, a new recruit trying to re-ennlist a man named Hayami to rejoin Blue Submarine no 6. The Blue Submarine fleet is one of earth's last defenses against Zorndykes fish chimera forces. One of the only flaws is it's never made clear why the captain went out of his way to re-recruit a former soldier named Hayami, personally bond that they had aside, he's experienced but doesn't have any special knowledge/skills that separate him from everyone else.  As the story progresses, Hayami spares the life and later befriends Mutio, who is a member of Zorndykes forces. Much of the story is spent in sea battles and flashbacks. Eventually, Hayami and Kino find Zorkdyke's base, and find that his army are not a group of villains, but a race that worships him for creating him, and he has even educated them (one has read poems from the Manyoushu.) It' has an emotional conclusion that I'd rather not spoil. Overall I really enjoyed it. The only other gripe is while the 2D animation is well done, the early 3D effects look like something out of an early PS2 game without HDMI upscaling. But said 3D is infrequent, and the environmental themes, and characters, plus an interesting jazz soundtrack make it worthwhile.",1507420800,,1828,4.766561514195583
