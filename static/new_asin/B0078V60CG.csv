8512393,2,B0078V60CG,The sound quality of this video is horrible. The authentic footage in the film is fascinating but doesn't make it worth purchasing/owning. I'll probably donate it to the local library so others can view it and won't make the same mistake. It needs to be remastered!,1357862400,,265,4.782608695652174
8512394,1,B0078V60CG,"All I can say is that I am very displeased with this DVD. The picture and sound are terrible, like someone set camera in front of a TV and recorded it. I have a copy of Theirs is the Glory on VHS and the picture and sound quality is 100% better than this DVD. With all of the technology out there I do believe they could have done much better.",1353974400,,343,3.914285714285714
8512395,5,B0078V60CG,Product was exactly what I ordered and worked great. Glad such a classic movie is for sale on Amazon. Cant wait for more classics to be offered.,1348444800,,144,4.37037037037037
