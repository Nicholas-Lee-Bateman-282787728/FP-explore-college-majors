2418676,5,B000BITUIE,"The Burns Bros have done many wonderful things - I believe this is the best.

It is cinematic, emotional, clever, thoughtful, informative...I've given this as a gift to a dozen new yorkers and they have all raved.

Man on Wire - which won an academy award - is essentially inspired by this film.

It is simply wonderful.

Touching, emotional, and wonderful.",1260489600,5,357,4.80327868852459
2418677,5,B000BITUIE,"I own pretty much every dvd there is to own on the creation of the World Trade Center.  This dvd delves further into the conception and construction than any other.  Lots and lots of interviews with many important figures, and tons of archival footage and photographs.  This documentary goes much deeper into the politics of it all than many other documentarys on this subject.  What it does not do, however, is go into the engineering of this building, which lead to the reasons for the collapse. (There are other dvds which go into great detail on this subject.)  I think, now that I have seen this final chapter in Ric Burns documentary, I might just have to buy the entire dvd set.",1255478400,3,685,4.581967213114754
2418678,5,B000BITUIE,"By far one of the best accounts of the history of the World Trade Center.  At a full 3 hours, this documentary covers the World Trade Center's conception, construction, impact on the city of New York, and the horrible, horrible day of September 11, 2001.  The final hour leading up to and covering September 11th should be required viewing in every high school history class in this nation so that we never, ever forget.",1255305600,,420,4.662162162162162
2418679,5,B000BITUIE,"This is a complete history of the WTC from its birth to its demise. It might give you some perspective on why it's taking so long to build the new Freedom Tower. The highlight is the high-wire crossing between the two towers by Philippe Petite in 1974. He's either an alien or a Jedi Knight. The footage of people jumping from the towers is chilling, including the horrified reaction of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. This film should be shown to all high school kids. It's well-narrated by former MASH star David Ogden Stiers without his signature Major Charles Winchester Bostonian accent. FIVE STARS without a doubt.",1223683200,11,616,4.820754716981132
2418680,5,B000BITUIE,"""New York: The Center of the World"" is probably one of the finest documentaries about the construction of the twin towers of the World Trade Center. In the three hour documentary, Ric Burns successfully told the tale of New York's two mightiest landmarks through interviews with journalists, architectural critics, politicians, construction engineers, and Port Authority officials.  This film surpasses the History Channel's ""World Trade Center--The Rise And Fall Of An American Icon""  What I did however find discouraging in this fine film was the very negative ""Never To Be Seen Again"" attitude about the twin towers from some of the interviewees regarding the rebuilding of the complex.  Many worldwide including myself have felt that the towers should be rebuilt and the only one in that film who has reflected that sentiment was Phillip Petit who walked the high wire between the towers in 1974.",1203206400,7,900,5.236111111111111
2418681,5,B000BITUIE,"I was totally riveted when I caught this on WLIW.  Wonderfly done, tactful and of course very sad.  I ordered it immediately.",1188950400,5,125,4.636363636363637

8087178,5,B000BITUIE,"This is actually the last piece of Ric Burns' terrific 8 part documentary on the history of New York City, but this holds up well as a stand alone piece, focusing solely on the inception (with some complex and dark politics involved), building, controversial life; was it a boondoggle, a white elephant? Or a real attempt to revitalize an area.? Was it even legal to be financed as it was? Is the architecture ugly? Or is there power in it's simplicity?

But, obviously the real power of the film is the buildings' horrific death on 9/11 and the aftermath. Burns walks the edge beautifully, creating a piece that is moving and terrifying, without being maudlin or exploitive. He picks powerful images, but intercuts them with touching and philosophical insights from many who were there, or were otherwise involved.

Putting the events of 9/11 into the perspective of the towers whole 'lives' gives this more depth than many of the other documentaries I've seen on the subject.

Just two notes - consider seeing the whole ""New York"" series that this capped off, and Amazon is way off the mark when they list this at 600 minutes. It's just over 2 hours.",1411776000,,1152,4.75
8087179,5,B000BITUIE,"I've seen a lot of DVD's about the WTC, before and after it's tragic destruction, but AE had a lot of new material I hadn't yet seen. And, that opening sequence, with the Manhattan Bridge in the foreground, that was really cool.",1393804800,,228,4.4523809523809526
8087180,5,B000BITUIE,"This documentary is a segment of a PBS series about New York City.  It is the story of the World Trade Center, from its initial conception to its destruction by terrorists and the aftermath.  Well worth the money.  It even includes the story of Philipe Pettit, the man who tightrope-walked between the Twin Towers, and a fascinating interview with him.  Get this one!",1371600000,,367,4.777777777777778
8087181,5,B000BITUIE,I was so moved when the series first aired. I didn't even see the previous episodes and haven't to this day. Beautifully narrated and scored. The details of Phillipe Petit's walk which I remember when I was in junior high school as well as the tragedy of 9/11 are all so well done. The wonder of the high wire walk and the chilling horror of the tower attacks make this a Burn's best in my opinion.,1347408000,,398,4.25
8087182,5,B000BITUIE,"For those unfamiliar with the early history of the Towers, this is a must. No sugar coating over the greed, corruption and difficulties that were involved with this project. Some who did not know may find it interesting that when they were first opened they had a great deal of difficulty filling these monstrous towers. The interior design on some of the floors actually wasted space. I remember when the towers were built and going to eat in the restaurant and seeing the circle of shops surrounding the eating area. They were ugly then and were never pretty to look at. This is a real picture of what came to symbolize more than the destruction of real estate property. Families will never be the same since that shameful morning almost ten years ago. Nations will never be the same.",1313971200,,786,4.661870503597123
8087183,5,B000BITUIE,One of the best documentaries ever produced. Wonderfully written. Outstanding photography. David Ogden Stiers gives a lesson on how to do narration. I'm blown away every time I see it.,1266105600,2,184,5.166666666666667
8087184,2,B000BITUIE,"I would have liked to have seen this documentary include more of the relevant players of 9/11 adding their perspective to that portion of the documentary.  As an example, you have former Governor Mario Cuomo instead of then Governor George Pataki and former Mayor Ed Koch instead of then Mayor Rudy Guiliani.  Of course, PBS might claim that they declined to be interviewed.  Also, they spent a considerable amount of documentation time earlier in the documentary romanticizing about the illegal WTC tight rope stunt performed by Philippe Petit in 1974.  While it was no doubt an amazing performance, I do remember the reaction from New Yorkers a little differently then they depict in this documentary - New Yorkers viewed his stunt much less favorably at the time (at best, most NYers were indifferent).  Additionally, PBS's suggestion that ""globalization"" was the key factor that led to the ""demise"" and destruction of the WTC, with no mention of radical Islam or ""terrorists"" or even more mildly ""extremists"", masks the true reality of 9/11, as we know it, in this apparent documentary.  So, while this documentary includes a nice history with select moments of the WTC from conception to 9/11, it leaves out some key players and facts related to the actual events of 9/11.  Unlike the other commentators before me, I'm not so sure that I could recommend it because of its mostly interpretative view over pure fact. Hope this helps!",1264550400,5,1436,4.98326359832636
