8398680,5,B003K48HPS,"Now that Gary Burton has retired (sob!), having performances like this available on video means even more to me.  This is great music---beautiful, haunting, and dramatic songs played with creativity and virtuosity.  My two criticisms, both minor, are about the visuals rather than the music.  One, I wish the disc was a blu-ray rather than a DVD; on a big screen, you will definitely see some artifacts of the low resolution.  (Sorry, I don't know the technical names for them.)  Two, the repeated, rapid-fire cuts between cameras used in a couple of the high-intensity passages are annoying and just plain stupid.  (Problem solved by looking away from the screen for a few seconds.)

Anyone who loves either Gary Burton's music or Astor Piazzolla's should have this DVD.",1508889600,,771,5.0236220472440944
8398681,5,B003K48HPS,"This is a well done video of an important live concert held in Buenos Aires in May, 2009.  The concert brought Gary Burton back together with three quintet members - Pablo Ziegler on piano, Hctor Console on bass, and Fernando Surez Paz on violn - along with Ricardo Lew on guitar and Marcelo Nisinman on bandonen. Those familiar with Gary Burton's earlier work with Piazzolla will not be disappointed - the arrangements and performances are superb. Video and sound quality are excellent although a little more of Lew's guitar in the mix was needed.

For those familiar with Piazzolla's work, this is a fine addition to any collection of his music.

For those new to Piazzolla's work, this is excellent introduction which contains many of Piazzolla's best known works.

For the price, this is an incredible bargain.  Buy it!",1285027200,2,823,4.892086330935252
