8734838,4,B015XC8BBY,"Virginia Mayo is bad gal Flaxy Martin, who is a two timing gangster's girlfriend, her other boyfriend being mob lawyer Zachary Scott (of Mildred Pierce fame).  Scott takes a murder rap for Mayo, then spends the rest of the movie on the lam, trying to keep a step ahead of both cops and gangsters.  Several gunfights, amazing escapes (twice he gets out of handcuffs) and help from an ex-con client & nice girl Dorothy Malone keep up the action.  The whole cast is good but it's Scott's movie.",1467849600,3,491,4.556818181818182
