8634768,4,B00HRFSYHC,"This review mentions plot points that are on the back of the DVD cover. Some people might consider them spoilers.  Three Thai teens share a NY apartment. It is New Year's Eve and they need a pick me up. They managed to hook up with a dealer who makes house calls, but Mr. Jesus turns this into a home break-in style film. This aspect of the film is basically a ""B"" 3 star film. I appreciated the film more once it was over.

Good thriller.
