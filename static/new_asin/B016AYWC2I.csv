8736155,5,B016AYWC2I,"It came exactly as described and arrived on time. I'm very happy with this. It comes with both episodes, a one hundred page art book with concept art and storyboards, a soundtrack disc, and it all comes in a nice case and collectable boxing.

I should probably not that the discs are region free. The audio is Japanese only with subtitle options in Japanese, English, Chinese, German, Spanish, French, and Italian. The bonus features are in Japanese with subtitle options in English.",1466208000,18,483,4.890243902439025
8736156,5,B016AYWC2I,"Provided you can shell out the usually high costs that come with all imports, this bundle of both the kickstarter-funded sequel along with the original 2014 short film is a fantastic deal. With the smooth slipcase and an in-depth art book, including a gorgeous original soundtrack; this is the complete Little Witch Academia Package.
Both films together include subtitles in seven quality separate languages (those being English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese and Japanese) for not only the main shorts, but also for the two making-of documentaries that provide deep, insightful and fascinating insights on the pre-development of the films.
It also helps that these shorts are some of the strongest pieces of original animation in the last few years in anime. Every frame and motion bleeds with fluidity, and the minor details reveal apparent influences from more western origins. The character designs are a breath of fresh air, and the hand-painted backgrounds never slump on delivering the mood of every scene. Though short, the Little Witch Academia films are made with sincerity, to last endearingly, and to function as a surprisingly accessible gateway piece for anyone who finds even remote interest in the medium.
(p.s., it also really helps that this was graciously sent by a domestic retailer here in the U.S., and the quality of the delivery earns that 'new' distinction)",1465776000,21,1394,5.255605381165919
