7847779,2,6303431003,"""The Laughing Fish"" introduced the new era of Batman animation, and it's a solid story. The Joker's licensing scheme and the resultant skewering of corporate financial dealings makes good comedy. This episode is also notable for the introduction of Harley Quinn as Joker's moll--a character who grew so popular in the animated series that DC Comics eventually had to introduce her to the regular DC Universe (Kevin Smith fans will also note that he has named his daughter after her).
While the animation and story are great, this tape is recorded in EP mode, meaning you'll get fuzzy picture and muffled sound. The packaging drops the rating from four stars to two stars.",999216000,4,671,4.946902654867257
7847780,4,6303431003,"Warner Brothers' dark, serious Batman cartoons succeed brilliantly with superior storytelling, excellent voice casting, and gorgeously intimidating graphics.
This tape features two Batman encounters with The Joker,  brilliantly voiced by Mark Hamill.  Christmas With The Joker is a Christmas  Eve telecast in which The Joker and his minions perform acts of sabotage to  draw out Batman and Robin.  Joker's hilariously demented introduction -  ""And now, LIVE, from Gotham City, the show that nobody wants to see,  but EVERY0NE WILL WATCH!"" - alone is worth the price of the tape.
The Laughing Fish is a remake of a 1978 DC Comics Batman story.  The  Joker has poisoned fish with his laughing toxin, but the poison has no  effect on humans.  Therin lies the real point; Joker wants legal claim to  ""his"" fish so he can collect enormous profits.  Aiding him is his  scatterbrained love interest, Harley Quinn, voiced with engaging joy by  Arleen Sorkin.
These are the best cartoons anywhere, lightyears better  than anything ever turned out by Disney or Hanna-Barbera.",926467200,17,1065,5.176470588235294
