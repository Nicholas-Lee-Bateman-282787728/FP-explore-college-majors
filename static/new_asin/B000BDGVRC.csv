2414528,4,B000BDGVRC,"When I looked at the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it. I'm a big fan of Pimp movies. And this one not only expores the game, but it also incorporates something that we can all appreciate- love. This movie is very entertaining as well as dramatic and it covers a lot of realistic views of the game. All the characters took their parts seriously and made this an appreciative production. If you like ""game"", you'll love this movie!",1134000000,6,443,4.349397590361446

2414539,5,B000BDGVRC,I saw this movie for sell at best buy several times and I thought it was going to be corny so I never brought it.  One night I was up late painting my dinning room and BET was on.  I happened to look over at the TV and I started watching the movie because I wanted to take a break from painting.  I could not take my eyes off this movie.  I was so surprised at how good it was.  It was not just about pimping and hoeing but it had real emotion involved.  I really thought this movie was very creative and entertaining to watch.  Snoops lady was really sexy Kudos to him!  LOL I can't wait to buy this movie!  I definitely recommend it.,1185321600,,635,3.9761904761904763

2414542,5,B000BDGVRC,"Snoop delivers. I think this is his best acting to date. Dogg lays the game down pat and he's funny as hell. Big Red from the Five Heartbeats is great as Snoop's mentor to the pimp game. If you like money, honey and hoes this movie is for you!",1169510400,,243,3.979591836734694

2414544,5,B000BDGVRC,"I'll tell you that I was skeptical when I heard about this movie. All doubts were erased when I saw the production values, saw the beautiful women, and heard the flyest in-movie soundtrack that I've heard in a while. Snoop plays a character that all of us fellas can relate to and want to be. Shillae Anderson is so damn fine too! You've got to see this girl. She will probably blow up after this role. The girl that plays the attorney is ridiculous also. Get this movie and get a hold of some of the tracks from the movie. Ride out and pimp on! Be easy people.",1152403200,2,561,4.203703703703703
2414545,5,B000BDGVRC,"The Peak of Snoop's ever diverse movie career! This one is a period hip-hop drama musical, or something. Will he be able to top this? Only if he stars in a remake of ""Uncle Buck""*! Somebody PLEASE make that happen!

8085499,1,B000BDGVRC,"I saw this movie on cable television and I must say that Snoop Dogg will not be taken seriously for roles like this. For those who believe that this film involves love, then your interpretation of love is screwed up! Snoop's character idea of love is pimping ""the love of his life"" so he can become the ""number one pimp,"" or fool as I see it. Who pimps out his or her lover? A fool does. Since this movie makes since if you NEVER met a loving and non-manipulating person and you're one who is so damaged in life and you don't want to be one who knows real love, then you found something that would make you smile. For those of you who don't mind saying you have more than two functional brain cells, you may choose to watch them film for a laugh because you will get that because I find it VERY unfathomable how a lawyer will quit her job after getting a murdering pimp out of jail or prison and start a life of prostitution because Snoop Dogg's character is so convincing. That is what happens in this film: the lawyer trades her career for a manipulating, broken fool of a pimp because ""she loves him."" Fathers, DO NOT PRAISE this garbage, or that ""lawyer"" may be your daughter, niece or whomever you claim to love. This movie is garbage, even if you like Snoop Dogg's brand. There is no one in this world worth trading and degrading yourself for ""love,"" which is not true love. Whoever wrote this film must be a regular user of narcotics as well as those who thinks this film is good. I hate that veteran actor Hawthorne James is in the film since he can act and should have had higher standards for his career. If you think ""boss'n up"" is pimping insecure, broken females then this film is for you. Career women with daddy issues and ""I love my man so much, I'll ...,"" this is also your film. This film is so shaming: full of stereotypes and disrespect toward humanity, mostly the females. If any of you are offended by my comments, then please think if the prostitutes, including the lawyer turned prostitute, was your granddaughter or even yourself. Is your body worth the scraps they defile themselves for? The answer is no. Snoop Dogg would snap if his daughter did any of the garbage these ""actors"" did in this film. I know it happens in real life, but this still is not something to praise and imitate.",1437868800,,2312,4.379069767441861
