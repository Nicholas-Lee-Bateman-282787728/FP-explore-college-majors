8324076,5,B000BUUK7W,"I was skeptical that some DVD could do what none of the other doctors and physcial therapists have ever been able to do.  I was told, and believed, that because I had a herniated disk I would always have to deal with chronic low back pain.  I was wrong.  The first day I started the BackStable Program I noticed a significant difference.  My back felt immediately better and I was more secure in what I could do without worrying about my low back ""going out"" again.  Within a matter of weeks, my low back pain that had bothered me for over 10 years, was virtually gone.  I continue to use the BackStable DVD as a preventative measure so that I don't have to go back to my Chiropractor, regular doctor, or physical therapist.  It is really straight forward and only takes me about 5 minutes a couple times a week.  I highly recommend this to anyone with low back concerns.",1132617600,,871,4.4
8324077,5,B000BUUK7W,"I have seen several traditional doctors that never helped my low back problems.  Never once did doctors tell me how easy this could be.  Someone recommended this Backstable video and if I would have known how easy it would have been to get rid of my pain, I would have done it years ago.",1132358400,,287,4.296296296296297
