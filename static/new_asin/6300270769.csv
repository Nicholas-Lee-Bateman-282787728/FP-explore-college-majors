7809378,5,6300270769,"Looney Tunes cartoons have been entertaining millions of fans for decades. Most people are aware of some of the animation giants that helped to make these cartoons such a great success, like Mel Blanc, Chuck Jones, and others. But few are aware of Friz Freleng, the man who helped to create several characters (like Granny) and helped to bring others to life. This video collection was assembled together as a tribute to this man and his contributions to animation.
Eight cartoons are included in this video, including three that won Academy Awards for their excellence: ""Birds Anonymous"", ""Speedy Gonzales"", and ""Knighty Knight Bugs"". The cartoons on this video are all first- rate and they all contain memorable moments, but these award winners (along with possibly ""A Mouse Divided"") are the standouts on this collection. ""Birds Anonymous"" is my favorite of all. With its parody of Alcoholics Anonymous starring Sylvester and Tweety with Sylvester trying to give up birds before addiction sets in, it is a cartoon that is both funny and serious, certainly worthy of any awards it earned.
Friz Freleng himself makes no appearance on this video. There is no interview or anything else on the tape. The only ""tribute"" is a written one, on the back of the video box, penned by Entertainment Tonight's film critic Leonard Maltin. The tribute aspect of this video collection refers to the fact that Freleng took part in the production of all eight of these cartoons, and the ones chosen here are among the finest he ever crafted.
This is a fun, entertaining video for people of all ages. It is difficult to find, with Amazon.com being one of the few places on- line (or any place else, for that matter) where potential buyers will be able to find this video. It's worth the effort to seek it out, and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Looney Tunes gang.",1086048000,12,1861,4.782608695652174
7809379,5,6300270769,"Friz Freleng was one of Warner Brothers most entertaining animators. From Rocky and Mugsy, to Yosemite Sam, he created some of the silliest characters ever.
Mainly Bugs Bunny and Sylvester are highlighted in the fifty-fifty split on this collection. From the Warner Brothers Golden Jubilee 24 Karat Collection, originally released in 1985.

For Sylvester, two of the cartoons Friz Freleng directed, won Oscars. Speedy Gonzales and Birds Anonymous. Friz Freleng stretched Sylvester away from his work chasing Tweety. A Mouse Divided shows an ironic relationship with an adopted mouse, and an fatherly Sylvester.
For Bugs, three of the four cartoons he appears in, features the short, Western villain, Yosemite Sam. High Diving Hare, Bunker Hill Bunny, and the only Bugs Bunny cartoon to win the Academy Award, Knighty Knight Bugs. The other cartoon Show Biz Bugs, was the backbone to the Bing Crosby and Bob Hope relationship for Bugs and Daffy. The cartoon also was the inspiration for The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show in the 1980's.
Although Friz Freleng passed away in 1995, his cartoon creations remain everlasing. These cartoons have generated a lot of fun, and for many generations to come.",999648000,15,1193,5.181347150259067
