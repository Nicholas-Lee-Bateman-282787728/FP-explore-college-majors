The disc is filled with trailers and and the novel of the classic itself for your DVD-ROM.  The menu screen started the trouble with the highlighted selection being hard to determine.  The trailers seem to be from a bad source and do not flow within the DVD.  The video interviews are cut short as they begin to get interesting, I have yet to sit down and listen to the audio interviews.  Overall the production value of the disc is quite poor and the art for the cover and the insert looks as if it was done in two seconds.  After releasing a nice hidden classic such as ""The Asphyx"", ALL DAY ENTERTAINMENT needs to take lessons from Anchor Bay in quality for your buck.  For die hard collectors of horror only...",995414400,8,876,4.459119496855346

7943161,3,B00005KH2A,"Yeah, the DVD isn't top-drawer, to be sure.  But let's not forget the focus of this whole thing: the ""lost"" t.v. pilot TALES OF FRANKENSTEIN.  The video quality is good, the sound is O.K.  Personally, I enjoyed getting to see the show after reading about it for years.  It would have made an interesting anthology-type series.  The trailers are fun, but not from the best sources in many cases.  For die-hard Hammer fans or Frankenstein enthusiasts, the disc's deficits are acceptable.",996105600,10,485,4.925925925925926
7943162,2,B00005KH2A,"It is nice that this release has a few treasures to offset what is more or less a messy presentation.  The treasures are: a couple of nice bloopers featuring A&C and Lugosi, The complete pilot for Tales of Frankenstein, and some interview footage that I've seen around before( they cut most of this footage short at very odd places- who made this decision and why?).  There are a whole bunch of trailers-the b/w ones are almost always dupy and/or re-issues.  A few are enjoyable.  The infamous Lon Chaney jr. episode of Tales of Tommorrow is here in a condensed version- sad and interesting.",996019200,6,591,4.70873786407767
7943163,2,B00005KH2A,"This is a fun collection, but a terrible DVD.  The video condition is pathetic, the menu is to difficult to navigate and the sound is murky. I did enjoy the audio commentary during ""Tales of Frankenstein"" and the audio interviews with Boris Karloff and Glen Strange.
I was really looking forward to this DVD and its sister production, ""The Horror of Hammer.""  I will be holding off purchasing HofH until I read a few  positive counsumer reviews.",995846400,3,445,4.753246753246753
