So different than anything else out there, and completely enthralling.",1239235200,6,161,5.75
3730630,4,B001OMZYEK,"While it states ""The Complete Series"" it is not a ""Complete Story""! It leaves you hanging at the end of episode 12.
 The animation is execellent and is definately worth watching but I could not give it 5 stars. It starts with two crippled Samurai getting ready to fight. Then it jumps back and lets you see how the Samurai met and what happened to make them the way they are. Yet this story never progresses far enough to take you up to the opening scene.
 A swordsman looking for a dojo that is superior to his own skills so that he may better himself as a warrior. He finds such a place after losing to a senior apprentice. Later he is accepted as a student & over the next year he slowly wins almost all over with his skill. Yet he has a hidden agenda which becomes clear as the story advances.
 There is a lot of gore and nudity...there is a woman who gets her nipple cut off only to have it eaten by another man. One man eats the eyeball of a fallen opponent. As I said a lot of gore.
 I do not believe in telling the whole story in a review nor do I fully read those types of reviews. What I can tell you is the type of series that I like....Black Blood Brothers..Death Note..Fullmetal Alchemist...Trinity Blood...Hellsing...Gantz..Basilisk. If you like those then you will more than likely find this well worth your time.",1238630400,,1328,4.321285140562249
3730631,5,B001OMZYEK,"Awesome anime!!! Bloody with a compeling story, a must see. However if i recall there are only 12 episodes. If that is the only number of episodes that are released in this set then I must warn that I don't think they completed the series. The beginning of the series it starts off with the final show-down between the two samurais but before they commence the final fight it cuts off into the story as to what leads them to that point. Note by episode 12 they are disfigured but not as disfigured as in the beginning of the anime and doesn't give more detail as to what happen to them to become so. Also they don't conclude the the final fight and who wins. Even despite that I still recommend seeing it because what they do explain leaves you begging for more. So I hope there are more than 12 episodes on this set!",1238630400,2,817,4.27741935483871
3730632,5,B001OMZYEK,"With a backdrop of true events and based on the manga series written by Takayuki Yamaguchi, the anime series ""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is a very violent tale of lust, dark ambition and vengeance that takes place during the 1600's in the Tokugawa period. Yamaguchi took his ideas from the novel called ""Surugajyo Gozenjiai"" and with director Hiroshi Hamasaki, the two have put together a harrowingly beautiful anime series that pretty much took my breath away. The series is about the famed Kogan school of Japanese swordplay, which became famous in the Kagegawa region, mainly because of the tutelage of a mysterious swordsman named Iwamoto Kogan. Unlike the chambara films we've seen in the past, this is not a series about honor, loyalty and duty; it is a melodrama about a school, its sensei and his apprentices. IT IS NOT YOUR KID'S Anime.

The series begins with two scarred warriors facing off against each other in a brutal contest to satisfy the bloodlust of a cruel lord Tadanaga Tokugawa; a blind swordsman named Irako Seigen (voiced by Nozomu Sasaki) and a one-armed swordsman called Gennosuke Fijiki (voiced by Daisuke Namikawa). These two warriors carry the scars of a very violent and twisted past. They were bitter rivals under the tutelage of sword master Kogan Iwamoto (Seizou Katou); the two aspired to attain the mastery of the Kogan style secret techniques and to be worthy of their sensei's beautiful daughter Mie (Houko Kuwashima). This is the story of these two warriors who had mortally wounded each other--physically, emotionally and psychologically, all for the honor to become the heir to the Kogan school. Now they must gird themselves for one last battle...

""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is a series divided into 12 parts (2 discs). The presentation contains beautiful animation, visceral and violent swordplay, and has been noted because of the amount of graphic sex and nudity. The screenplay and direction are both beautiful and ugly. It is beautiful because it utilizes superb style in its cinematography. The colors lean towards the use of earth colors, and a little muted which adds to its brooding, intense mood and gloomy style. This has been done to reflect on the bleakness of its subject matter which brings us to its ugly face. The ugliness I speak of hover mostly around in its disquieting storyline. The subject matter is about the darkness within the ""way of Bushido"". I wouldn't say that these men are true samurai who follow the ideals of that code--these men are very human, full of lust, greed, betrayal, and ambitions. Unlike other chambara features we have been privy to, they are NOT men to be admired for their character; they may be admired for their skills but they are mostly to be feared.

The screenplay by Yamaguchi is quite intense, taut and very moody. In the school, we see the workings of its inner circles, and the rules that apply to the Iwamoto residence. The feature also utilizes some very effective use of metaphors and symbolism. The Cicada is an insect used to signify apprenticeship because of its noisy, vibrating qualities. The dragonfly represents unrelenting totality because of the straight direction in its flight. The Butterfly is used to signify beauty and the unpredictable nature of one's future. I thought it was wise direction to use the ""flashing"" naked effect when one engages in swordplay--I think when fighting, one's nature is utterly exposed and one is unprotected. Sure, it also displays the movement of muscles in engagements but it was a lot more than that. The direction relies on some fragmented sequences, to further give its characters their dimensions in the story. Quite clever and ingenious, the proceedings manage to maintain its intensity in not just its graphic violence.

The action sequences aren't really your run-of-the-mill choreography. Slow-motion animation, freeze frames and close-ups are utilized. The swordplay is very graphic and it never holds back. Eyes and limbs are severed, beheadings, bowels and entrails are graphically shown, and looks very reminiscent to Japanese effects we've all been privy to. Dismemberments are done quite often, as well as ""skinning"" and faces and bones being smashed in. The thing is director Hamasaki does the Blood and Gore in a very artistic kind of way, it was impressive--not too repulsive but certainly shocking. The combatants imagine just how they would react to an attack before the actual combat begins which serves as a sort of a teaser to the viewer.

The feature does have its share of graphic violence towards women, but I don't think it glorifies it at all. It uses those actions to display the cruelty of its characters, most specifically sensei Kogan; who manhandles his daughter and has a lot of sex with his mistress, lady Iku (Emi Shinohara) when he is in a state on dementia. Oh, this feature has a lot of graphic sex and nudity. There are some very twisted displays of torture and violence; castrations by fire, cut-off nipples and burned breasts are what you are in for. Incest and sick desires are also hinted at. Yes, this is one disturbing anime feature and not for the weak of heart.

The characters are for the most part very human, in a way they give in to their carnal desires, pride and blind obedience--it does have certain undertones about curses and karma. Irako is the prideful apprentice, who almost whose goal is to attain fame and fortune--he is also a womanizer and proves to be his main weakness. Mie is the daughter of the master swordsman, Kogan; she is dutiful and becomes imbalanced in a way. Lady Iku is the beautiful mistress of Kogan who is always taunted at by children and believes her body to be cursed. Iwamoto Kogan is the sensei who becomes demented from time to time for reasons unspecified; probably due to his very violent ways. I suppose if a hero is to be had from this feature it would be Gennosuke, the stoic pupil, ever obedient to his sensei who carries a grudge against his rival--Gennosuke is driven to master the art. Let's not forget Gonzaemon Ushimata (Yosaku Yara), his one flaw may be his blind obedience.

The animation is fluid and very beautiful and it was almost photorealistic. There are no bulging, over-expressive eyes and the facial expressions speak a lot for their emotions and manner. I thought it was wise for the animators to give its characters certain features quite unique to one another. Each separate scene have a use of one color hue to express its mood, but stays within earth colors--to signify its worldly workings in its environment. If there are some flaws, it would fall on some minor details undefined and it does lack some closure.

""SHIGURUI DEATH FRENZY"" is one twisted and brilliant animated production. It successfully reaches a plateau that surprisingly mixes beauty and repulsive qualities. It is so beautiful that one would be hard-pressed to say that it is all about disturbing imagery yet NONE can deny its visceral, brooding tone. It does efficiently represent what it is trying to say and gets its message across; The beauty of swordsmanship can lead to one's damnation when wielded irresponsibly. ""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is beautiful, and magnificently executed, but it also leaves a repulsive taste in your mouth. I am very impressed as to how it managed to balance beauty and artistry with ugliness and repulsive nature. I almost didn't want the show to end.

Highly Recommended! [4 + Stars]
Note: Please use the original Japanese Language track as it preserves the mood and emotions.",1238544000,,7533,4.94391785150079
3730633,5,B001OMZYEK,"The anime is classified MA and is no for teenagers or infants. This is not a full time action anime ; it's a drama for adults.

3730634,5,B001OMZYEK,"""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is among the most twisted anime I've ever seen and an outstanding vengeance tale from a culture stuffed to the gills with similarly-themed works. It is based on true events (whatever credibility you give to that) and takes place in feudal Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate. It's spectacularly graphic in both the sex and violence departments, but features extremely beautiful artwork and a pace and tone that is almost Kurosawan in it's meticulous and thoughtful storytelling and features a very gorgeous traditional Japanese soundtrack.  But as artistic as it is, there enough mayhem, nudity, and general psychosis here to rival any Asian grindhouse flick I've ever seen. This one is not for the kiddies.

In the opening sequences the audience is treated to a retainer pleading with his daimyo to allow a tournament to use wooden blades rather than steel ones lest their most talented samurai die needlessly.  He then opens up his slit belly and pulls his entrails out with his bare hands, telling his lord that that would be the only result of a tournament using real swords.  His final plea falls on deaf ears and bloodthirsty eyes that have more than a hint of madness in them. As the tournament begins we see the first two samurai face off.  It is a one-armed swordsman versus a blind samurai.  While the audience mocks the pair, it is soon obvious that the two are not only skilled warriors, but have a past together.  The story of ""Shigurui"" is that past.

Rewind to a few years back in time and we meet earnest sword pupil Gennosuke Fujiki and Seigen Irako, a stranger to the Kogan dojo who seeks audience with the sensei.  The two clash, leaving Fujiki embarrassed and possibly stripped of his status as the heir to the deadly techniques of the sword school.  Kogan Iwamoto is the deranged sensei whose advanced age regularly leaves him in a state of vulgar dementia with a string of neverending drool in the corner of his mouth and a habit of urinating on himself even as he performs feats of swordsmanship.  Even more disturbing, the man still has a sexual appetite when in his glassy-eyed stupor. As Kogan's concubine Lady Iku, she gets to bear the brunt of that, though the sensei's own daughter gets a taste as well.  The children of the town sing a song about Iku's body bringing misfortune and death to all of her lovers, but that doesn't deter Irako but getting a piece of the action.  This is something that he will regret as he seeks the title of heir to the secrets of the Kogan style. And eventually, each and every character will regret the chain of events that forms.

As I said before, ""Shigurui"" is not for kids even if it does seem like a typical samurai anime on the surface.  There's plenty of viscera, eyeball abuse like you wouldn't believe, decapitation, and dismemberment. In fact, the Kogan school seeks to spread it's name not by killing those who challenge it, but by ""giving them a new look"" which is to say the cut off various facial features so all of Japan can see their prowess rather than hear about it.  Then there's the graphic sexual content which includes watching Kogan's drool fall upon his daughter as he ""inspects"" her suitability for breeding, a rather explicit but brief glimpse of cunnilingus -which I've NEVER seen in an anime (and no, I don't count hentai as true anime)- and a woman getting her nipple sliced off then watching her attacker pick it up and lovingly place it upon his tongue. Yeah, this is twisted stuff. Kogan is among the most intimidating and disgusting villains ever and the rest of the cast are more tragic victims then heroes.  In fact, I think it's safe to say that there are no heroes here at all; just brutality, cruelty, and selfish deceit.

I really wish I could give this a perfect score because it is so harsh and uncompromising but still manages a plethora of beautiful and artistic flourishes that give this anime a credibility that few examples of the genre have anymore.  But there is a fatal flaw that left me feeling less then thrilled at the conclusion in spite of the fact that the final kill is quite possibly the most impressive I've ever seen animated.  While it is the best samurai anime I have seen in a long time, at only 12 episodes ""Shigurui"" becomes a victim of it's own slow pacing during the second half and the viewer can't help but feel a bit cheated at the lack of resolution in the story.  After the amazing setup of the first episode, we never see it revisited for a fitting conclusion.  It's almost like the staff got bored and just decided to move on before the story was done. A few more episodes -even one- could have easily garnered this show an unapologetic five star rating.  But frankly, it's close enough. This is an anime that will absolutely warrant repeat viewings.

I am very pleased to say that this anime has been released in a full boxed set right off the bat.  None of the month(s)-long waits and customer-gouging
while each disc is released individually.  Thanks, Funimation! While there is not much in the way of extras on the discs, there is a ""marathon play"" feature which means that the discs will play as a continuous film rather than making you fast-forward through the opening and closing credits every 20 minutes.  I hope to see more of these things in the future.  They are reason enough to buy this set.  If we support more quality anime releases that take the fans' wishes into account, maybe we'll see more of this kind of thing.

""Shigurui: Death Frenzy"" is an outstanding adult anime that stops just short of all-time greatness, but is still an absolute must-own for fans of animated sex, violence, and chanbara films.  The soundtrack, animation, plot, and characters are all first-rate.  It's some of the best of classic Japanese arthouse cinema with all the cheap thrills of the grindhouse.  Buy, buy, buy!

3730641,4,B001OMZYEK,"This is a slow paced, art and gore fest story. Not for the people that want instant gratification or an anime with humor relief.
No, this is a serious, gruesome anime about bitter rivals. The plot drags sometimes but the art direction and the music totally satisfy if you are willing to see it through.
This is such a serious anime that some times it can be stressful feeling like a burden on your shoulders, but that is just how great it is.

[possible kind of spoiler]
Even the ending or lack-of fits the over all feel of the whole experience perfectly.

The cons? There's a few, I would have liked to see some things explained before the abrupt end, and I could have done better with a little less of explicit inner anatomy classes, but that is just nitpicking.
This is a brutal and intense piece of anime art taken fro chapter one by heavy emotions and a true sounding Japanese soundtrack (at least as I am concerned)

3730642,3,B001OMZYEK,"Let's get this straight and out of the way now... This anime is NOT for young audiences, for those of weak constitutions, who cannot watch scenes of torture, rape and violence. If any of these things bother you, DO NOT buy this product. I'm not saying
I like the latter things, but it's a genre of anime rarely explored, that is quite often misunderstood as a perverse thing.

With that said, I can carry on with the actual review.

This is an interesting anime with a plot that leaves alot of the imagination. That can be both good and plain out bad, but truly this anime rides along the line. Most of the scenes involve talking (which you have to pay close attention to, for it's easy to lose yourself.) Most of these scenes take place in dark dojos and small places, with little amounts of actual music and more background nature noise. The best song is the intro one, which I classify as one of the best songs I've heard in a while.

The action is brief, yet satisfying. If you're looking for big explosions of power and energy, with flashy swordplay and exaggerated combat in which everyone clenches their weapons or fists and yells really loud, inabling them to fly, then this is not for you. This anime has sword combat to a more realistic degree, where battles only last mere seconds with one kill hits and precise cuts. To be honest, it seems to me like that's how samurai swordfighting was like in those times, so I come to accept it as a new form of fighting in such shows.

The graphics and animation are well done, with the use of multiple layers and shading textures. It uses physics well and colors can be both bright and somber.

The one thing I agree with many is how the ending occurred. It was simply a drop and there was alot unanswered questions. At first I was really upset and I felt betrayed. But after reading why it ended like such, I felt more reluctant about it. Turns out this anime was cancelled due to its high level of violence and lack of fan base. Honestly, I thought this anime could've gotten better had it proceeded as scheduled, yet I'm not surprised it stopped. If you're really curious as to how it all turns out, you can read the manga online.

With enough said, I believe this anime did go a bit overboard on the violence and such, but it had one of the most interesting stories I've seen in a long time.

This Anime is well grounded and creates a real sense of what samurai life might have been like in certain clans. I do not want to write a long review but what I will say is if you are looking an anime which is more grounded and NOT filled with all that super human nonsense this is it. And yes it does indeed reflect the violence and abuses deemed acceptable in those times so if you like what you see on the cartoon network this is not for you.

3730656,5,B001OMZYEK,"This is by far the best anime i have ever seen. I cant even think of anything that comes in as a close second. I am actually surprised that with such a rich basis for this genre (Historic Samurai Martial Arts) there isn't a variety of other series that can be turned to for similar depth, realism, darkness, and maturity of plot (NOT referring to nudity and violence).

Everyone is aware of the copious amounts of stupid exaggerated images pointlessly plastered on screens, which we have come to refer to as ""anime"", consisting of carbon copy squeeky stick figures whose eyes represent 3/4 of their face and the extent of their characters development, interactions, and depth are eternally defined by 4 generic expressions : embarrassed, angry, smiling, and confused. If this is what you find entertaining then please don't bother your self with this series, which is a one of a kind, category of its own, unrivaled masterpiece. There are approx. 5 billion episodes of DragonballZ and/or Pokemon that you can occupy your self with, plus 1 thousand other equally meaningless teeny-bopper alternatives of the same caliber. This is not one of them. In fact everything from Basilisk to Ninja Scroll falls closer to being in the category of Pokemon than it does to equalling this series. Simple and plain.

Although I must warn you of two things, ok well maybe three. One is that this series is not completed, neither in its anime form nor its manga form. And at the this time, the rate that the anime is progressing in terms of production, if you are substantive enough to enter into the pace and the plot, you may find yourself very wanting and crazed at the end of this series, because after this there is nothing...yet....we hope... (I hope Madhouse realizes what a great responsibility they  are carrying, the future of the best anime in the world is on their shoulders). The second thing is... well actually, looks like I forgot the second thing, so I am gonna hav to skip that.... But the third thing is - violence, or I should say ""gore"" to be more exact. Now i am not against gore and I am not really for it. Violence is expected in anime to make it good and I am all for that. But some of the gore in this (although only momentary and only in a few scenes throughout the whole series) made me a little squeamish-ish, almost. Oh yeah I remembered the second thing, and this is an important one, THIS WILL COMPROMISE YOUR ANIME EXPERIENCE. After watching this you will be reluctant to watch other anime, seeing them as distasteful, generic, and corny. I am now trying to figure this out and solve it...

Anyway at this point i only see two possible alternatives that could satisfy my interest and taste (other than to see this series effectively and efficiently follow up on the manga). That is to see either Samurai Executioner or Path of the Assassin faithfully made into an anime that bore the similar authenticity and integrity as the original manga... though I am feeling a glooming premonition that I may be destined to live in want, not seeing the fruition of either of three possibilities....",1287619200,2,3103,4.677655677655678
3730657,4,B001OMZYEK,Death Frenzy is a very appropriate title there's tons of blood and violence no superpowers just Killer samurai action.,1280188800,,118,5.2631578947368425
3730658,2,B001OMZYEK,"This anime is a perfect example of great art with poor story. I checked this anime out not expecting much from it i'll be honest. I now know why this anime was such a disappointment. You try to enjoy it but it's very hard to. Shigurui is an extremely abstract anime that feels like one freaky mind trip when you watch it.

The pacing of shigurui is extremely slow. Which doesn't at all help with the confusing and poorly developed plot. The episode are out of sequence and don't explain anything that is happening or has happened. Your left to decipher that for yourself while also having to deal with figuring out what the real story is with all the imagery they used.

  I didn't expect much out the anime from the get go but as I watched it I tried so hard to like it. But, how can you when the first episode of the series has NOTHING! and I mean NOTHING! to do with anything else that happens in the 11 episodes after it. Matter of fact after I watch all 12 episodes and went back to the first trying to figure out where it fit in. The only thing I could think about that maybe 11 more episodes were missing to explain what happened to the 2 main characters at the beginning.

 One guy loses an arm and the other one can barley walk and there's a sword wound on his foot. I mean what happened? Who did those things? These guys are the 2 greatest swordsmen in the land that's what the 11 episodes basically tell you then all of a sudden your thrown a wild card? That's just how screwed up this anime is not even the 1st episode is right.

There's plenty of good animation. Probably what kept me from putting this thing back in the case. The story again is so slow you lose interest in it after a while. There were actually points in the series where I thought that my DVD player was stuck but it was just another still screen. There's lots of action in the film but mostly it's just a still screen of them holding or locking swords and then the move after its been executed. I mean this is the laziest anime I have ever seen. They don't even try to show you a good battle it's all just left to imagery.

When you watch this anime I'll tell you one thing. The character they present to you as the hero type actually isn't. Matter of fact he doesn't do a noble thing in the anime. He doesn't care who he hurts just as long as he can please his master. The one guy they try to make out to be the villain is actually a good guy...I think. I mean he calls the one guy scum for torturing a woman but then there's a completely random scene where he kills a random female character. Which isn't explained at all. This guy by default becomes the hero because he's the only one willing to save the girl and defeat the real villain...but this anime does not make any sense! **possible spoiler** there's this theme throughout the entire anime that the daughter of the dojo's Sensei hates her father and overall want's the other villain guy to save her. Then when he comes and slays her father she resents him and somewhere along the line she has fallen in love with the guy whom she hated so much she went into a 3 year depression.**spoiler end** So just what in the heck was her character even about? I mean this anime doesn't tell you anything. It's just well drawn art some dialog,a lazy still shot battle scene, more dialog and then episode end. If your watching this your definitely doing it for the artwork. I can tell right now I'm going to be forgetting this anime and it's sad. This could have been great if they threw some effort into the dialog and plot. Overall all this is just a smoke and mirrors cover up to conceal an anime with a lazy story.

3 stars. 1 for the artwork and 2 because I actually like the character that was forced to be the mistress. They actually managed to make me care about her character and what happened to her because of all the abuse she went though.

ooohhhh btw did I forget to mention that scene where the random guy with big eyes is fantasizing about a young boy who recently died and is performing fellatio on himself? How could I forget such a wonderful scene I mean wonderful at least 5 good minutes of seeing the boy in his underwear doing random poses. Ah yes.....this was such a great scene I needed so much to see all of that... oops im sorry did I accidentally take another star off the rating?",1279929600,2,4338,4.253640776699029
3730659,1,B001OMZYEK,"this could have been one of the most brilliant things i've ever seen...and heard.  the animation and the soundtrack work in a synergistic harmony that make it a feast for the eyes and ears.  characters are developed well and their motivations are convincing, from mad, heartless scumbag to blind ambition and megalomania.  this is really good stuff.  but it ends there.  the series just ends.  right in the middle of things the episodes stop.  the product description is fat out wrong.  there is no battle between these two samurai.  we are drawn in by the battle preparations in the first episode and in the end the series never returns to that battle.  it never finishes the journeys of the two samurai in that opening fight.  this show never finishes anything.  so in the end all we have is pointless, twisted carnage.  the violence and sex fit into this show.  brutal and tragic endings i am fine with.  bad guys winning?  no problem.  i like the bad guys.  nobody winning?  fantastic.  i can live with how an artist chooses to end their work. so i'm not complaining about that.  but there is no end.  the series never completes the story it claims to tell.  it is this fact that the series simply stops, like the developers took a lunch break and never came back, that is absolutely unforgiveable.",1276387200,31,1302,4.638766519823789
3730660,4,B001OMZYEK,"Shigurui is one-of-a-kind.  I was blown away by everything this series had to offer.  It is an anime adaptation of the first volumes of a comic that is still being written in Japan.  I think it's important to know this before you watch, considering the beginning and ending of the series (which I won't spoil).

Shigurui, as you may have read, starts off in 1629 Japan, introduces two swordsmen, and their final duel to-the-death.  Before the fight begins the story goes back in time 7 years.  My advice to you, who would buy this, is to consider the real ""beginning"" of the show to be the flashback.  Forget about the duel in the future.  Forget about learning about everything that happened before the duel.  That hasn't been written in the comic, and it won't be told in the anime.  The real story is that of the dojo -- the dojo where these two fighters first met and trained.

Martial arts fans will love Shigurui.  The often used theme of training and improving of one's skills is prominent in this series.  The action scenes are sparse and brief, with a very gradual build leading up to some of the most intense and violent animation I've ever seen.  I was jumping out of my chair more than once.

There is very disturbing themes and images in this series, not limited to blood and gore.  Every episode had at least one scene or idea that was sickening, by even the most twisted standard.  You name a taboo, this series probably breaks it.  Horrible things occur that I've never seen animated, or acted out, or even thought about.  I can't say that these weren't done purely for shock factor, but I found it very entertaining nonetheless.

Animation quality was top-notch.  BluRay conversion, I'm not so sure about.  Other reviewers have noted the ""intended grain"" in the animation, but I definitely noticed the grain and don't think all of it is intentional.  Some scenes are bright-white, and any grain is hard to notice here.  Many other scenes are much darker and have a noticeable grain.  But the grain never really goes away, even in what are supposed to be the prettiest moments.  This got on my nerves.

Music and sound was outstanding.  It set the mood perfectly.  I can't praise it enough, or think of a single negative thing to say about it.

Unfortunately, at 12 episodes, Shigurui is over before you know it.  Be sure not to watch it all at once, space it out over the course of a couple of weeks.

Overall, this was an excellent show.  I recommend this purchase.  Definitely not for anyone under 16.  If you are buying for someone younger, be sure to watch it with them, and have a nice long talk after each episode.  Chances are you'll need it more than they do :^)",1275091200,,2687,4.548117154811716
3730661,4,B001OMZYEK,"I hesitated about watching the anime, because the description emphasized its violent nature.  However, I found it to be a realistic portrayal of a sliver of feudal Japan.  One often finds the samurai being portrayed in movies as noble beings who sacrifice themselves for lofty goals, but this anime shows the other side of such a martial culture.  The nobles, except for one, cower before their lord's madness.  Everyone is flawed, and their seething envy, ambition, betrayal, and cruelty lead this bitter story toward the inevitable conclusion strewn with bloodbath.  The series did seem to end abruptly but the manga seems to have continued and one can download the story in places such as Manga Reader.",1274572800,3,705,5.043103448275862
3730662,3,B001OMZYEK,"I purchased this series based on reading a few of the reviews and the product description/summary here on Amazon.  I found them to be a bit misleading.
I do not watch or download anime online, nor do I rent it.  I much prefer to support the anime industry by purchasing what I want to see.  I ""research"" my purchases by reading reviews, product descriptions, checking out wikipedia, etc.  Very rarely do I make a blind purchase & just buy something without checking it out first.
Shigurui Death Frenzy was one of those purchases that, while I did check out reviews & product descripitons, I found the information about it to be somewhat misleading.  What I expected from what I had read & what it actually turned out to be was different than described.  I agree with many of the other (non five star) reviewers comments, mostly about it being slow.  It was extremely slow paced.  Because of that it really didn't hold my interest, thus making the storyline somewhat hard to follow.  The storyline was good, but I expected more action than there was.  I thought the animation was beautifully done & the music complimented the series well.  Very artistic.  I give the series a 3 out of  5 stars.  I CAN see why some people would enjoy this series.  I, for the most part, did not.  I think Shigurui Death Frenzy is most certainly one of those series that either one will enjoy alot or not at all.  I would recommend watching this (or atleast some of it) BEFORE you buy it.  Rent it, borrow it, or watch it online if you can.  Atleast then you will know exactly what you are getting.  YES, I know that goes against what I said earlier, but I consider Shiguri Death Frenzy to be an exception to the rule.

3730663,5,B001OMZYEK,"This is not an anime for kids and immature people. This anime is great for people who enjoy watching great character development and great story.

This anime is intended for mature adults who likes serious dramas. So I think even those who usually don't watch anime will appreciate this.

3730665,4,B001OMZYEK,"I've seen a little over 100 anime titles since my (nearly) eight years of watching anime, and Shigurui is one of the most violent and psychotic I've seen that doesn't spiral into cartoony schlock such as <cough>Elfen Lied<cough> and <cough>Gantz<cough>.  As you can see by the score, I was really glad to see Shiguri as well.

The plot is that in Japan circa 1629, during the rule of Tokugawa Tadanaga, a tournament is held where two scarred warriors fight to the death.  The two warriors are Gennosuke Fujiki and Seigen Irako.  Their pasts are unraveled as so you can see why things happened that led them into this fight.

CHARACTERS

One of the things that makes Shigurui stand out is how interesting they are.  Since this is set in the years when the samurai populated the Japanese landscape, it shows the really unpleasant yet often overlooked realism in their lives.  What I mean is that unlike most anime focusing on the lives of samurai, there's no tale about becoming a hero and triumphing over their inner demons.  Shigurui instead focuses on how a rivalry was forged between the two main characters and how it spiraled into a visceral bloodbath.  There's also no clear-cut good or bad guy in this anime, practically everyone (save most of the female characters) has shades of evil in them.  Fujiki may seem the most sympathetic main character because he has an unbending loyalty to his master, the ultra-demented Kogan Iwamato, who'se in charge of the Kogan-Ryuu school.  I personally like Irako more simply because he was simply a man who wanted to raise his status and thought he could do so by becoming a pupil at Kogan-Ryuu, but ended up having a falling out with Kogan and became blind.  Kogan is easily the most detestable character because of his ultra-violent and maniacal behavior to everyone.  Two of the most notable acts that shows how sick Kogan is are a scene where he goes up to Lady Iku, his concubine, and cuts off her nipple.  The other is when he sticks his sword in Gonzaemon Ushimata's mouth, which cuts the edges of his lips and makes his oral cavity look much larger.

PLOT STRUCTURE AND PACING

My only gripes with this anime is that the plot can be a little slow at times, and that the ending seems a little unfinished (though not quite like the detestable ""completely sudden cliffhanger"" featured in horrid anime like Elfen Lied), though the final battle towards the end is one of the best I've seen in a martial arts anime.  On the upside, though, it seems like everything that happens in Shigurui actually adds to the story and thus, not really much pointless filler to detract from the viewing experience.  I felt that the events were well structured in a way that wouldn't make you bored since I was on the edge of my seat nearly the whole time watching this, anxiously anticipating what would happen as each event occurred.  What I also find really refreshing is that Shigurui has next to zero comedy in it.  The only part I could say that even comes close to being ""funny"" is when there's an arranged marriage between Seigen and Mei and Kogan keeps saying ""Conceive!"", which I think was put in only to show his demented behavior and not for any intentional comic relief.  Comedy for an anime like this would only hurt this anime drastically, and I'd be the first to throw giant rocks at it because I have ZERO tolerance for that.

MATURE CONTENT

As stated before, Shigurui is one of the most gruesome anime titles out there.  I'd even say that if compared to an anime of similar ilk, such as Ninja Scroll, it would make the former title look like an episode of Sesame Street in comparison.  Heck, in the opening scene, you see a fellow whose cut himself to demonstrate the consequences of using swords in duals by yanking out his entrails, and the gore in said scene looks quite real for an animated series.  The violence even had me, a pretty seasoned gore hound, wincing at some scenes.  There's also a good helping of nudity.  I felt that the nudity was pretty well used in Shigurui because despite its pretty abundant quantity, they felt like they belonged in nearly all of the scenes they were used in.  The nudity isn't all pretty, either, there's a pretty weird scene where Lady Iku sees herself nude, with large bugs crawling on her.  Another scene towards the end of the series shows how the many acts of cruelty inflicted upon Mie Iwamoto literally eats away at her body and is starved, and she doesn't look pretty in this stage.  There's also male nudity in Shigurui as well, since it lightly shows the encouraged homosexual relationships shared between samurai in that period, which was also further explained in the booklet that came with the series.

SOUNDTRACK

Shigurui's soundtrack is really superb.  It consists entirely of ethnic Japanese music that fits perfectly with its setting and thankfully, is also used in the opening and closing scenes.  The music itself is also well incorporated by not overpowering the scenes they're played in and distracting the audience from the action.  This is a really warm welcome for those who are sick of J-pop and J-rock constantly being regurgitated in anime.  The cherry on the sundae is that it's consistent, a quality that's missing as well since the ""in thing"" in most anime is to mash different and unfitting styles of music in its soundtrack.

ANIMATION AND ARTWORK

Once again, Madhouse Studio has made another great anime, and it shows in the production values.  This is some of the most beautiful (albeit disgusting) imagery I've scene in anime.  The animation itself is also really well done since everything seems to move rather smoothly and the incorporation of CGI into this 2D anime is tastefully done by only complementing it rather than overtaking it.

FINAL WORD

If you're looking for an ultra-nihilistic, martial arts-themed anime with one of the most realistic atmospheres to it, then Shigurui will reward you pretty handsomely.",1269561600,,5950,4.751703992210321

Rent this if you like to see characters not moving any part of their bodies except their lips. It's very well drawn but there's no movement.

I noticed a pattern:
1. Characters sit or kneel, talking or thinking.
2. A bad guy smiles and giggles.
3. Someone looks very surprised.
4. Repeat 1-3.

3730668,1,B001OMZYEK,"I have to say this may have been the most repulsive, gloomy, and just unenjoyable anime I have ever seen. There was almost no story to this anime, and the characters were portrayed horribly, I felt absolutely nothing for any character in this anime. The pace of the show is very slow and there really is not much action, every fight lasts a couple of sword swings and ends with a gruesome death. With such repulsive scenes with no catharsis whatsoever, this series was just not enjoyable by any means. Blood and gore is fine as long as there is a good story and characters I care about, but because both of those qualities are lacking I found a women's nipple being cut off and eaten, a man's eye being eaten, a disgusting child birth scene, incest, and all types of gruesome and violent acts to just be completely vulgar. This was not the worst anime series I seen, but it is definitely near the bottom and I can not ever see myself watching this series again. I highly advise against buying this product. If you want a good a good samurai anime here are some better ones to check out: Samurai Champloo, Samurai 7, Peacemaker, and Basilisk.

I had not seen a trailer or anything about this anime before, it was a complete blind buy, based off the Amazon recommendation and after I read the 5 star reviews on the item's page. Hopefully some people will support some of the lower rated reviews and get them on the main page, because I would hate to see many other people buy this product based off the 5 star reviews like I did.",1263427200,6,1527,4.414893617021277
3730669,5,B001OMZYEK,"For a 12 episode series, the price is terrible.  There, I said it.

Now, on to why this is a 5 star show.

Subtlety.  While other anime shows are in your face and grinding your intellect to a pulp, Shigurui is one of the rare series to allow the unspoken moments resonate as loud as the occasional bits of dialogue.  Tension is carved exquisitely on the characters' faces.  It's chirascuro tone is beautiful and brutal all at once.  Each episode is a wild trip into the gritty brutal world of 13th century Japanese samurai.

Please do yourself a favor and find some way, any way, to get a hold of this series.",1259280000,,609,4.375
3730670,3,B001OMZYEK,"The reason behind my review on Shigurui is to concisely convey the truth behind this series, since the other reviews misled me to believing I would really enjoy it.

The cinematography and animation is truly the best part. The color and angles are spectacular. The flashbacks, the background nature shots, the characters facial expressions. This animation mix stirs up emotions without words superbly. Also the music compliments the animation very well. Much of it is slow, suspenseful, and well placed. If these two elements are what you enjoy most about anime, you will enjoy the series.

The overall experience was beaten, shot, and then run over repeatedly by the very dark, sullen, gross, depressing, hard to follow, and boring story. Read other lengthier reviews for details. Even with only 12 episodes, I still found it took myself over 3 months to finally get through them. I simply found better, more uplifting uses of my time. Also, there was redundant gore and very little action... a terrible combination. No big, elaborate fight scenes, just a slice of light or a sword flash here and a limb breaking or a head slipping off there. I gave this series a very generous 4/10 for the animation and music alone, but it won't be enough for me to ever watch Shigurui again.

Even after all my bashing you're still interested, at least take the time to watch a few episodes on narutowire or any other free online anime service first to see what you think. Even if you like what you see, try not to spend more than [...] 20 bucks for this series. You'll thank me.",1256515200,4,1566,4.728937728937729

feel of the story, but is terrible in my opinion. The only things that
seem to be good about Shigurui are the visuals. The artwork is pretty
colorless which makes it feel dull at times, but it's visually
impressive nonetheless. I would only recommend this to people who are
fans of gore or people into swordsman homosexuality because that's what
they'll find when they watch this.",1253232000,2,594,4.613207547169812
3730673,4,B001OMZYEK,"This is worth watching if you are looking for a darker series. If looking at the cover arts turns you away, then don't bother. The story is bloody and doesn't pull punches. It is also fairly complicated with the politics of the dojo and the small sampling of Japan in that era. Is this historically accurate? I don't care. Darker stories are difficult to come by as it is.
The artwork is not anything that will detract from the show. The audio is not amazing. No part was particularly lacking. The conclusion was not all I hoped for, but that helps the series perhaps.
A number of people have said that they couldn't like either main character. All of the characters were so depraved and they had no investment in any of them. The characters' have their moments of admirable actions (save a few characters). Seeing their humanity and how they handled similar situations differently is what made this worth watching.
I don't love gore, but I appreciate directors not holding back (so long as it doesn't become an exposition). Unfortunately, there are some scenes where it really is just exposition. The most valuable part of the series is the moral (or ethical) problem of what should/could have been done. No, this is not as good as Berzerk. No, it is not a great directing masterpiece like from Kurosawa. It is Shigurui, a bloody, dark, tale you can enjoy if you managed to watch Berzerk through to the end.",1252540800,,1408,4.658634538152611

3730675,4,B001OMZYEK,"To be honest, I almost abandoned Shigurui somewhere around the first 2 or 3 episodes. The virtues of this series are at first masked behind opaque layers of extremely graphic violence, sex and nudity. Not that I have a problem watching violence, sex and nudity. But too often are the three used as stand-ins for a missing story. But that is not the case for Shigurui. Our story here begins with a tournament between two samurai with severe disabilities that they were clearly not born with. Instead, these handicaps were brought upon them by an event (or events) in their lives prior to their stand off. From here, the story circles back to the beginning, following the breadcrumbs that lead to said tournament. It is here that we learn that these two men, Fujiki Gennosuke and Irako Seigen were competing successors to their master's dojo. Fujiki, who was initially the obvious choice to follow in his master's footsteps, is suddenly eclipsed by Seigen. However, sex, betrayal and Fujiki's need for redemption and revenge re-tips the scales of the story. That is when things turn really nasty.

Just how nasty they get, will be for you to discover.

Seeing the hideous deformities of the two men at the beginning foreshadows the volume of carnage that you can expect to witness in Shigurui. Do not underestimate the visceral impact of this violence because the series is animated. The explicit detail of a man's entrails rivals what you'd see in a live action version. The good news for those with a weak stomach is that, thanks to minimal animation, you typically will only see the before and after of some disturbing slicing and dicing. The bad news is that the fast cuts between a raised sword and a hashed body amplifies the tension, and the long takes of a sliced off limb gives the imagination plenty of time to either recoil or recover from the aftermath. You'll be given generous time to meditate on the upper portion of a person's face. To aid in your meditation is an atmospheric soundtrack that makes the image either terribly putrescent or strangely poetic. Or both.

This dichotomy alone might be the brilliance of Shigurui. By walking the line of gratuity and minimalism you certainly get a feeling of art and not pornography. Even the explicit nudity and sex is so disturbing that it neutralizes any inherent erotica. You also get a clean break (or slice) from the usual good versus evil thing. Shigurui offers us no protagonists or antagonists. There's only an ensemble of characters who stand on the same nihilistic stage and under a morally ambivalent spotlight that casts no judgment on any action or ambition - no matter how foul.  All men are truly created equal in this series: equally troubled. Equally troubling. And equally twisted.",1248739200,16,2758,4.836864406779661

I put this one right up there with ergo proxy in weirdness. i recomend this to anyone who wants to see a guys head get sliced in half and his brain spill out of his skull but i warn you take it for what it is no engaging charaters to draw you into an engaging story line.  each episode left me wanting more of an explination. i watched the series once and probly won't watch agin i would rather watch ninja scroll for the 100th time or elfin lead for blood and a great story or even samuri x for the engaging main charater that this anime lacked,1245888000,,1045,4.169154228855722

This is a title that seemed to come out of nowhere, and it was great from the start. How could this have been passed up by me?
Yes, the story revolves around early dynasty Japan and Samurai, but it is not what I expected, or have really seen before.
First off, unlike most Anime, the music is absolutely excellent, and makes this story dark, brooding and mysterious. It is deep and effective. No goofy J-pop teenager whailing her head off here, just dynamic and powerful, as soundtrack should be.
Second, the figure detail is better than the box lets on. There's a wealth of art in this story, and the stylization of the drawing, painting, and even 3D varies regularly, without jumping around so much you get dizzy.
Really, they may use only subtle 3D techniques, but they are gorgeous.
Lastly is the story. I actually read a review here that said it was ""slow"". Perhaps it could be seen that way, but only if you're looking for a sword fighting frenzy. This is so much more than action. I just have to say that these writers know how to do what is missing from most anime, and that is how to create depth without needing a saga of episodes to successfully develop the characters and plot. From the very first episode, I was hooked. I've been watching anime since the beginning, and this is one that I'm buying on Blu-ray. The dialogue and sets, the tension, the darkness, and the violence all have space to breathe, and flow together very well.
Put all these elements together and you have a viewing experience that no anime fan will easily forget. This is going on my top 20 list, and certainly is my favorite Samurai anime of all time. (Yes, better than Samurai 7, and better than Sword of the Stranger, just to name a few.) It's simply darker, deeper, and more mature on many levels. Sound like your style? Good, then buy it and help the industry.",1242259200,14,2064,4.948126801152738
3730690,5,B001OMZYEK,"This is the most historically accurate samurai anime I have ever seen, and my favorite anime of all time.  While I am not a big fan of violence, I love this show for its intensity and its riveting plot.  The animation is some of the best I've seen in terms of quality.

Since this show is based on a manga that is still ongoing, the series ends at the end of the second story arc.  The Shigurui anime concludes with an unforgettable duel to the death between two of the main characters -- a wounded samurai and the insane master he once served.

 However, since the manga has not yet ended, the final duel between Gennosuke and his rival Irako is not featured, even though it is previewed at the beginning of the series.  In the 24 page guidebook included with the DVD, the creators of the show stated that if they ever get the chance, they will make a second season one day after the manga is complete.

Most of the critical reviews of this show said that it was good, but the since the final battle between Gennnosuke and Irako was never resolved, they lowered their ratings.  These reviews are NOT valid -- the story actually isn't over, which those reviewers would have known if only they'd bothered to read the guidebook and look on Amazon.jp for the manga, which is currently on it's 12th volume.  (The anime only covers the first 6 volumes and the first two story arcs.)

I highly recommend this purchase to anyone with the stomach for it.  It is a show that you will never forget as long as you live, even if you forget every other anime you've ever watched.",1241913600,3,1566,4.399305555555555

It is a beautifully done anime with intense visuals. Both artistic and gory. At first i didn't understand what was going on because it starts at the end. But once it goes into the real story you are so caught up in what is going on that i couldn't stop watching. I watched the entire first disk in one sitting after dinner. By far one of my new favorites. If you like more complex and mature anime, you will love this.",1241740800,4,586,4.149122807017544

3730693,5,B001OMZYEK,"Anime is jam-packed with all kinds of romanticized, sometimes even watered-down depictions of samurai.  Shigurui, however, is the most historically accurate samurai anime that I am aware of, and is also truer to history than the vast majority of samurai movies.  It's not 100% accurate, but it's very close.

Shigurui is also the most beautiful anime that I've seen as far as its art is concerned.  The animation is very realistic (sometimes horrifyingly so) and depicts the darker side of the Edo era samurai class.  The tale is extremely engrossing, and highly enjoyable if the veiwer has the stomach for it.

While the plot is exciting, the anime often moves at a slow (but certainly NOT dull or boring!)pace.  It tends to draw moments out to create a feeling of tension and often contemplation.  Add in the eerie traditional Japanese music, and the show feels almost more like a traditional Japanese play than an anime... I believe it was designed to feel that way.  It is unique, and a very haunting experience.

Note that while the anime does have an intense and unforgettable final confrontation between two of the show's most skillful samurai and does provide a staisfying conclusion, the ultimate conclusion of the story (the duel between Irako and Gennosuke) is never resolved in the anime because the manga is still ongoing in Japan.  In the guide booklet that accompanies the DVD, the staff states that they did not want to invent their own ending and slap it on, but they hope to get the opportunity to make a second season of the show someday, dealing with the manga's second story arc.

I cannot recommend this show enough.  It is worth every penny you spend on it.  Heck, even if the set was $100 dollars it would STILL be worth every cent.

Please, please don't miss this.  Anime like this are one in a thousand.",1240963200,2,1829,4.7405063291139244
3730694,2,B001OMZYEK,"The story drags on and on. It jumps around in time, but doesn't really make you any more interested in the story. The action isn't all that great either. I stopped watching after the 3rd episode. What a waste of time.",1240617600,2,217,4.317073170731708
3730695,2,B001OMZYEK,"The Bad:
First off let me enlighten you that you should ignore the product description for this item.  The summary for the storyline that appears  in the product description for this series is way off.  The description talks about a last battle between two rivals in a tournament and such forth.  Who ever wrote that must have only seen the first episode.  The first episode starts at the start of the tournament and the other 11 episodes take place in the past.  With that being said the most disappointing part of the whole series is that the 11 episodes taking place don't seem to really lead up to where the first episode starts.  Leaving out quite a bit of time and events that lead to the two rivals in the tournament. The only other major disappointment is that the level of action was not as high as I had hoped.  I didn't really see any awesome samurai fights :(  just a bunch of quick ended fights with single cuts (I'm guessing here, all you really get to see is a flash of light and the sword is in a different place. lol).  Those two points were the only disappointments I had with the series but the first one especially ruined the whole series for me.

The Good:
The animation is spectacular.  It is really something to behold.  The series really harnesses vivid animation skills as well as very sound story telling.  The music is very good and fits the series well.  The story itself is quite awesome.  The tale of how the two rival samurais became rivals.

The conclusion:
The series has a lot of good to be said about it, but in the end none of that can overshadow the fact that it does not bring the story back to where it starts off, leaving you feeling incomplete and cursing your purchase.  I would not recommend this series.",1240358400,6,1747,4.423197492163009
3730696,2,B001OMZYEK,"I got a bit thrown off by many of the reveiws of this anime as well as the teaser clip that was showing on Amazon. Needless to say i was very disappointed with this series. After episode 2 the only thing that kept me watching wasn't the visuals, but the sheer fact that i had paid over $40 for this anime series and i was holding hope that it would get better.

I will split my reveiw first into the portions of this series that I did not like, then i will discuss what i did like and what the draw to this series is for the previous veiwers who rated it so high.

Pacing:
The pacing for this shows is especially slow. Every episode one thing and one thing only happens. Maybe with the exception of two episodes. This one thing feels like its drawn out through either lengthy speech's or the extreme overuse of visual imagery using cicadas and other insects. The best example of this is the first episode showcasing the 2 main characters standing off. That is the whole episode summed up. It is not any deeper than that.

Excessive use of visual imagery and shock value:
Throughout this entire show they seem to try to use an excessive amount of stop motion action as well as visual imagery placed only for the purpose of shocking the veiwer. I suppose most normal people would be disgusted by this but it did nothing for me except make me annoyed that i was sitting through someones intestines pouring unrealistically out of their body instead of getting some sort of story progression. It kept reminding me of Resident Evil 5, and thus making me wonder why me and my friend weren't plaing that instead of watching this. The trails of dead bugs and Uroborous gushing out of people hurt the pacing even more and at most points started to put me to sleep. The worst visual style they do in this anime is when they show the future. While this is excellent and adds a lot to the fights and lets the veiwer know how these samurai plan moves, they go to far with this as well. Showing a character have sex with a prostitute and then 9 months later launch a demon baby out of her. Yes, launch.

Character Models and Character Motivation:
This is the part that i mentioned earlier where i would discuss what many people liked about this anime. I hated the character motivation of getting stronger and losing there humanity for no other reason than to master a sword style from zombie-sensie. There is no war to fight, or even a battle to fight. There is no deep story to any of these characters, they just seem to find themselves mastering a swordstyle for no other reason than because they have nothing better to do and nowhere else to go. Thats what i found most boring about this entire show but what many will find most enjoyable. Its about the old samurai way of mastering oneself over all else. With no reason or no purpose for this mastery, nothing to fight for, i cant find motivation to care if any of the characters live or die. This is made worse by the fact that there isn't a single definably good character in the entire anime. They have all given up their souls for the sword and follow under zombie-sensie's rule, whenever he gets out of his zombie like state.

With poor pacing, ridiculous imagery and sequences, extremely shallow and static characters i found it near impossible to suck any enjoyment out of this show. While the story was interesting, it was completely ruined by the pacing and shallow characters. What has drawn most to this series are the exceptional visuals and the interesting story of a dojo that has given up in its own way every trace of humanity for the sword.

If you can, rent it, but unless your really into samurais to the point that it is what %80 of your anime and movies are based on, stay away from buying it.",1239580800,6,3753,4.431884057971015

A remake of a manga of the same title....my biggest beef with both the manga and the anime version...is that the entire plot is only the first chapter of a much much bigger story...without ruining it for anyone...let me just say that the most desirable version has yet to be made...If Takayuki Yamaguchi and Mori Hideki were ever to license off their series to a director for a live action film...
