1723812,1,B0000687M0,"I've seen many documentaries, but this one is absolutely the worse. No substance. You really have no idea what Hells Kitchen is, or get a real feel for the neighborhood. I can go on and on. Coming from a born and bred in NY guy. Terrible",1288310400,2,237,4.173913043478261
1723813,1,B0000687M0,"This film should be required viewing by every film student interested in documentaries. By watching it, he/she will learn:  (1) how to shoot and edit video so that the viewer can never quite focus on any one scene. Apparently this filmmaker is so uninterested in the details of the ""changing"" neighborhood that he prefers not to dwell on any of them. Instead, experiment with filming techniques that Man Ray tried in the 1920s  (2) chose subjects who are uninteresting, insipid and actually don't seem to know (or want to tell) about the neighborhood (3) Shoot all subjects in tight close-up, so there is virtually no context.

Perhaps some day someone will make a documentary that tells a coherent story of a truly fascinating neighborhood which has been virtually obliterated in the last ten years. This doesn't even come close.

a ps: A film entitled  ""Time Capsule""  shot by Louis Faurer in the 1950s-60s has recently been discovered, and has been shown briefly here in NYC (April 2010). Can't seem to find it for sale anywhere. Mr Faurer was a still photographer, who experimented with film, and this one was recently discovered by his son.

1723814,1,B0000687M0,"Technically good, lots of quirky characters in indoor settings - but - lacking a raison d'etre. Insufficient outdoor, streetscape footage. Hard to get a ""sense of place"". Yes, probably a student film.",1215043200,,200,5.28125
1723815,1,B0000687M0,"I'm a documentary fan, love New York City and enjoy quirky real life characters so I was eager to see this film.  Unfortunately it somehow manages to be totally unengaging despite what would seem to be a fascinating subject.  The filmmaker tells us early on that 40% of the people in the gritty (but gentrifying) ""Hell's Kitchen"" area of Manhattan make their living in an artistic pursuit and to that end a musician, an actor, a milliner (hat maker) casting director, independent film maker, playwright and some other creative types living and/or working in the neighborhood are interviewed.  These people are all talkative enough and in fact at times seem a little overly fond of the sound of their own voices but the filmmaker doesn't seem to be able to draw anything especially interesting or profound from them.  And then at the end of this short (82 minutes) movie we get an update on how life has been treating these folks and depressingly enough things have gotten worse for almost all of them.  The rest of the movie is mostly just disjointed shots of the neighborhood accompanied by some very unpleasant sounding music and the whole look of the movie screams ""student film"".  I'm sure a good documentary could be made on the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood but this isn't it.",1212105600,10,1280,4.795454545454546
1723816,1,B0000687M0,"Boring. they try and portray Hells Kitchen as the last bohemian refuge of artists; which it is not, that's pretty much anywhere you can actually afford in any of the 5 boroughs.
all these interviews could be taking place in any of the 5 boroughs, and the film doesn't convey anything that has to do with the history of Hells Kitchen.",1429920000,,333,4.475409836065574

1723821,2,B0000687M0,"This documentary was filmed in 1999 - fifteen years ago!  I was looking forward to seeing the architectural changes; the change in the community that currently lives in Hell's Kitchen now, and compare them to the community that I once knew in the late '80's and early '90's.
Yet the filmmaker/director was content with close-up after close-up of people that were what I would consider exceptions rather than the rule.  Only by the filmmaker's one statement that Hell's Kitchen was made up of mostly artists and musicians would you know that the people shown fit the definition.  Being able to play the horn or the drums only shows that you have a musical inclination.
When I spent time on the West side of Manhattan in Hell's Kitchen, the talent was palpable.  there were so many small venues that sold inexpensive beer and booze, and had amazingly talented musicians on stage.  The audience was full of struggling actors - a real community of artists that supported each other...  it was a magic time for ""Clinton"" (ha, ha).
Then the corporate fat cats showed up and bought every building they could get their grubby hands on.  They used scare tactics; turned off heat and hot water, and the electrical would go out all the time.  Soon you heard people whispering about areas called ""Long Island City"" and ""Jersey City"".
Many of the artists I knew were talking about moving to Williamsburg. Williamsburg?  All I knew about that section of Brooklyn was that it was right next to Greenpoint; a Polish community with a lot of Industrial businesses along the waterfront.  Well, it wound up being the next artistic mecca, and has for some years now. Yet again, the fat cats follow the artists, because they know we create our OWN community, opening small venues with local talent, that just may be the next Mumford & Sons.
So who has the vision (and talent) to go to Long Island City; to go to Williamsburg, Red Hook and Gowanus Canal?  Even Park Slope is having a renaissance below Third Avenue, where it was once all industrial.  Who is going to capture these unique communities before they disappear, because the Realtors' clients want to be in the middle of ""the scene""?
This documentary failed - failed big time.  My question is who is going to capture these other communities before they too disappear?",1403740800,,2304,4.758793969849246
1723822,1,B0000687M0,"I watch a variety of documentaries on a variety of different topics,and although this isn't the worst I have seen it makes the worst list.

I didn't learn anything at all about Hells Kitchen, other than  I wouldn't want to be there. Very disappointing.",1399334400,,375,4.514705882352941

1723824,2,B0000687M0,"Not so much about Hell's Kitchen as it was about some current inhabitants. I went to High School, in the late 50's in the area known as Hell's Kitchen. It was not quaint in a dangerous sort of way. Sure, it was full of characters, many of whom would kill you as soon as look at you. Didn't watch it all, didn't seem to have any historical perspective, never identified where, exactly, Hell's Kitchen was. Seemed to be intent on romanticizing a very unromantic area.",1390176000,,465,4.482352941176471

7964069,5,B0000687M0,"This documentary is more about the gentrification of a famous Manhattan neighborhood rather than it is about the neighborhood itself.

Overall, however, this documentary tells a clear, truthful, interesting story about the long time residents losing their little piece of the pie because of greed by developers and landlords; this documentary has a strong point of view and it has the bump and grind grit of the Big city.

To say the least, times are changing in the Big Apple. Hell's Kitchen, once a run down, gutter, trashy neighborhood filled with prostitutes, drug dealers, and muggers, today Hell's Kitchen is squeaky clean with huge price tags of $2 million for a one bedroom coop.

I know. I grew up in the Bronx and in Queens, a stone's throw, or a quick subway ride from Hell's Kitchen. What I have always found fascination about the neighborhood is how it got its nickname: about 100 years ago. French merchant sailors, used to live there by the West Side piers, and they filled the streets with aroma from their extensive cooking. Since the sailors were grumpy, out to sea too long, those who strolled in the neighborhood smelled the aromas from their cooking, and then confronted the grumpy sailors. Thus the name Hell's Kitchen was given to that section of Manhattan that stretches from 34th to 52nd Streets, from Eighth Avenue to the Hudson River. Today, to say the least, that neighborhood, as well as the Village, the Heights, and Harlem have completely changed. This documentary shows the transition in place with long-time residents trying to cope with the change: 40-story apartment buildings.

Once a neighborhood filled with five-story walk up apartment buildings, today has 40-story tall skyscrapers a few on every block. The old way of living is history. I remember once I went to that neighborhood to see Samuel Beckett's play ""The Endgame"" and was approached by prostitutes and drug dealers once I stepped outside. No more, now, the deviants are long gone.

I don't know if it was because I grew up not far away, or if this documentary deserved five stars because it showed and told the truth about the gentrification of Manhattan, nonetheless, I liked it. It shows how the Big Apple turned into the Golden Goose cash cow. NYC has changed. Except for the moniker of old neighborhoods like Hell's Kitchen, or LoSida, which is why I watched this documentary in the first place. If it was called between Time and Penn, I would have ignored it. But with a name like Hell's Kitchen, I clicked the play button to watch it. And I wasn't disappointed. Quite interesting.",1459641600,,2587,4.857142857142857
