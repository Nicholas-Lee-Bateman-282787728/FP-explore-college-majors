4854413,4,B005OT3FW2,"We received it for Christmas and have watched it in installments. Tears streamed from my eyes last night as the beautiful final scene filled the screen. We were all watching it, from my husband to the youngest, and we were all delighted in it.

I don't think I knew much about Saint Philip Neri beforehand although his name is so very familiar.  He is not a great saint of great accomplishments or great written treaties. He did not travel and his intellect did not shine above others.

What was great about him? His immense charity, his humble love for all who encountered him, poor and rich alike, wealthy merchants or nobles, murderers and pariahs, all were targets of his deep love and charity. He also had the ability to use great humor in all he did--all smiled and laughed around him! He lived in a hard time for the church and his unusual confraternity was investigated by the Curia more than once, only to disarm the pope completely when faced with his deep love for others and total trust in God's Providence.

The film was made for Italian TV and the production is very good. We loved the actors and the costumes. An impressive details is w they managed to gather such similar -looking actors to portrays the child and grown up versions of his followers, it is almost as if they started the film when they were children and waited ten years to continue, so similar they were.

Note: I read the other reviews and am very respectful of them and recommend their reading. Perhaps because we had such a wonderful time watching it as a family, and perhaps because we already know real facts are changed in films about saints, I still give it 4 stars. The film does show Christian love in many beautiful ways and we live in a world so thirsty for that. After the film we read a brief account of his life online and were further enriched.",1327881600,19,1841,4.5
4854414,3,B005OT3FW2,"It's strange.  When I finished watching this movie for the first time, I remember really enjoying it, but having had some time to think it over, I realize that this movie really has nothing that Bakhita didn't have, and, in fact, is just a tad bit worse in some areas.

This movie is made by the same director who did Bakhita and St. Giuseppe Moscatti, and I can't say I'm surprised.  Those films, like this one, were largely sensational pieces intended to amuse, but contained little or nothing that resembled the lives of the real people they were named after.  This film claims to be about Saint Philip Neri, and as usual, it has nothing to do with him.

St. Philip Neri was a very holy man who, at first, wanted to go to India as a missionary, but eventually decided to stay in Rome, where he started a secular club of sorts for educated Catholics who wanted to learn about God.  It had fairly lenient regulations, and he himself was a joyful man who believed that everyone else should strive for joy as well; particularly in prayer and worship.

Regrettably, he's not the star of this movie.

What we have, instead, is a very holy man who, at first, wanted to go to India as a missionary, but no positions were open, so he had to stay in Rome.  There, he runs into a gang of kids and spends some time caring for them and trying to raise them right.  Hijinks and misadventures ensue with the children, before and after reaching adulthood, and most of the story centers around them.  What little has to do with the film's title character is either wrapped up in his relationships with the kids, or in charity work with the poor and destitute, as though he were Mother Theresa, or in warding off a militant cardinal of the church who manages to sick two popes on him.  He then needs to satisfy both of them somehow to keep everything running.

Neri has something of a catchphrase throughout this movie ""be good, if you can.""  As far as I can tell, this disgusting catchphrase was never attributed to him, and shouldn't have been allowed to pass through the dark depths of the pen used by whoever wrote this movie.  It's one of the worst things about this film.

Another of the worst things about the movie is, as I've said, the repeated use of the church hierarchy as the villains.  It'd be one thing if it actually happened that way, but I've never read anything that would indicate that.  I won't say that higher-ups within the church never abuse their power.  Living in a place like the US, where organized protests against rampant evil on the part of the nation's cardinals and bishops are so rare, I wouldn't even think of making a claim like that, but it's a lack of devotion to church teaching, not an overabundance of it, that's the problem here.

Thirdly, the children dominate far too much of the movie.  This movie shouldn't be about them; particularly since Neri hardly ever worked with people under 30 in real life.  One of them (the girl Ippolita) also has a questionable neckline as an adult, which, in that time period, would have gotten her mistaken for a prostitute, and, in fact, does get her mistaken for one at least once in the film, if I remember correctly.

Now for the film's strengths.  Like previous movies by this director, it's a strongly-written story with a heartwarming conclusion and endearing characters.  If the real Saint Philip Neri had never existed, I'd have given it an A-.

The music of the movie centers largely around the main piece; ""I prefer Heaven,"" which, while simple, is easy to remember and catchy, and I'm been humming it off and on since I finished watching the film.  Most of the other pieces of music in the film are built around the same basic tune as the main theme, which is a bold move to make, but is used to great effect.  Some of the costumes were impressive, while others, in my mind, were less impressive.  It's not as strong as Bakhita in that respect.

Still, I honestly found that it made more enjoyable viewing than Bakhita, for a number of reasons, really, mainly to do with the quality of the characters invented for the piece, and the hard work of the actors involved; depicting their roles so well.

However, there's one last thing that I just can't get past with this movie.  It was less evident in Bakhita, and more in this production, but really, visible in both.  There's an unhealthy notion in the modern world that the role of those in the church is largely to help the sick and needy with their bodily needs, and then mostly get out of the way when big wrongs need to be righted, or when anything needs to be said about morality.  While Bakhita was shown caring for the sick, and rarely said a proactive word about morality, this movie goes out of its way to paint its main character as just as much of a hospice-runner as Mother Theresa, but without all those ""offensive"" viewpoints that condemn the popular views of the world as ""evil,"" ""reprehensible"" and ""sinful.""  I find that kind of bias on the part of a filmmaker to be the really offensive thing.

The fact that I had a good time in spite of all that is a strong testimony in favor of this film.  However, whether you want to watch it or not is really up to you.  There was a movie based on the life of Saint John Bosco, which did basically everything this film did, except that it was about a person who really did do some of these things, and it didn't try to paint him as weak-willed or morally-silent.

At the end of the day, I simply have to say that this is a very good movie, but not very good for Catholics.  Judging it just based on the strength of its characters and story, it was excellent.  Judging it on its faithfulness to the church produces a less-favorable result.  Let's just hope this director can get his act together for whatever he decides to do next.  I did have fun watching it, but I don't want to see any more good, decent people misrepresented or lied about.  That always puts a damper on my mood.",1326844800,11,5963,4.456221198156682
4854415,5,B005OT3FW2,"This is one of the best religious movies that I have seen so far. The acting was very believable and the story kept me very interested all through the movie. When I saw that it was made by the same director as ""St. Giuseppe Moscati"" and ""Bakhita"" I knew it would be good and I was right. If you enjoy religious movies, buy this one and you won't regret it!",1326585600,2,356,4.1
4854416,5,B005OT3FW2,"I just finished watching this movie, over two days because it is very long, and loved it.  I read all of the reviews, good and bad, and then wikipedia to see if I agreed that the movie had no factual basis.  I didn't see anything in wikipedia that was outrageously at odds with the movie.  It talks about his humor and wit, miracles, the oratory and there is a link at the bottom to flying saints.  But even if it took some creative license, it was a wonderful film.  I was always taught that a miracle is something that inspires faith.  If that is true, then this movie is a miracle.  The acting is excellent and the characters lovable.  A sweet, extremely enjoyable and uplifting movie.  It is in italian with english subtitles, but I didn't mind that at all.",1326153600,10,761,4.378571428571429
4854417,2,B005OT3FW2,"I came to this film already familiar with the life and spirituality of St. Philip Neri, who was my confirmation saint and in whom I have a special interest and devotion.  I discovered the film through the Ignatius Press catalogue, which seemed to bode well for its quality.  I thought it would be interesting to see a dramatization of St. Philip's life, and to be able practice my Italian comprehension as well was a bonus.  Well, my expectations were crushed as soon as I started to watch the DVD.  Instead of a straightforward biography of the saint, the filmmakers have woven a fictional story around the general person and times of Philip Neri.  In this account, Filippo is a middle-aged priest who comes to Rome, where he ministers to homeless children (in point of fact, Philip was a young man when he came to Rome, and his apostolate was primarily with young men); the film follows the children into young adulthood through various fictionalized subplots and Philip's building of a church and hospital to minister to the poor.  But in addition, the screenwriters have woven into the story a conflict between Philip and a Roman cardinal (played very well by Roberto Citran), who is suspicious of Philip's ministry and attempts to destroy him.  Now, in point of fact, Philip was for a short time persecuted by a small clerical faction who suspected him of starting a sect; but as presented here, this is no more than an excuse to work in the old liberal cliche of the ""intolerant, authoritarian Church"" oppressing all that's good and pure.  Philip is eventually exonerated by the pope and allowed to continue his apostolate, but no attempt is made to deal with the issues invovled in anything but a superficial manner.  For the rest, the movie is fuzzy on the substance of Philip's spirituality (which focused on finding God in the beauty of nature and art, and on returning to the Christian roots, the Bible and the Church Fathers) and the specific activity of the religious order he founded, the Oratory (which started out as an informal gathering for prayer, sermons and sacred music, and evolved into a brotherhood of secular priests which later spread to several countries).  The popular Italian actor Gigi Proietti is delightful in the role of Philip, but he can't change the fact that the script has reduced the character to a simplistic hippie-dippy type devoid of any intellectual foundation.

The film has some degree of entertainment value, though next to no religious or historical value.  Viewers, especially Catholics who are interested in this film for its religious content, should be forewarned of what they are getting.  At best, this is sentimental entertainment for children - though I would not show such an inaccurate film to any child of mine in order to teach him about one of my favorite saints.",1325462400,108,2825,4.860416666666667

4854420,5,B005OT3FW2,"Where can I start? What can I say? I just LOVE this film!!!! If I could give it 7 stars I would and that's no exaggeration. I have to admit it, I don't know much about Saint Philip Neri (SPN) other than that he was called the Apostle of Rome and that he is the founder of the Oratorians, one of the best orders in in the Catholic Church today, known for their great fidelity to the Church and their beautiful liturgies. I also know that TAN books has a great short biography on him. But enough of that already....about the film......

RAI 1 (the Italian channel that produces these movies) usually tends to secularize their saints somewhat excluding usually the aspects of the miraculous that have surrounded the lives of many of them. So I was greatly surprised when this movie covered it all! A truly Catholic film! Mystical visits, miraculous appearance of food, healing,......all captivated in a very devotional manner. What is even more wonderful is the joy that the actor brings forth on the screen. The actor, Gigi Proietti, brings it out in a most admirable manner and portrays the saint's exceptional humor, even at times that would make the best of us scowl and get dejected. And yes, there's LOTS of humor. Nothing that portrays our Saint as a clown, but shows us that heaven too has its light moments. Also in the characters that surround SPN, many of us will be able to see ourselves in our best moments and our worst.

Another aspect is how the Saint uses simple peasant wisdom to teach people who are erring. One poignant moment in the movie (and they are quite a few) is when a dejected follower of SPN asks why it is so hard to live the gospel message, and SPN answers ""Because it (the gospel message) is so simple!"".

This movie is all about charity, joy, sorrow, hope, human failings, brokenness, forgiveness and complete surrender to Divine providence. In short it is the story of mankind and the love God has for it and how he sends us Saints at the times we need them. Perfect for anyone and everyone. And for educators who love films on Saints who worked with the youth.....it doesn't get better than this. This movie should not be missed out on.

I do not know the historical accuracy of this movie. I will leave that to some other expert who will be able to verify it properly. However it is assumed that some artistic license would have been taken.

The movie is 205 minutes long in Italian with English and Spanish subtitles. It comes with a 16 page booklet with the following sections:
1)St. Philip Neri, the Man, the Saint by Carl E. Olson
2)Blessed John Henry Newman's prayer to Saint Philip Neri
3)Saint Philip Neri, priest and spiritual father by Rev. Fredericl L. Miller
4)St. Philip's Legacy: Holiness and Friendship
5)Discussion questions
6)Scene Selections

The only special feature in this DVD is a short behind the scenes of the making of the film.

By the by, get some Kleenex....you'll be needing them.....the humor and the tears of joy you'll shed will warrant them!
For more on the life of SPN I recommend as mentioned above the following book:

4854443,4,B005OT3FW2,"Well, here's another Italian TV miniseries on a Catholic saint released on DVD in the US by Ignatius Press. This 2010 film is a 3 1/2-hour hagiography on St. Philip Neri, founder of the Oratorians or Congregation of the Oratory, to which Cardinal John Henry Newman later belonged. There's a booklet with an essay on St. Philip inside the DVD box but no special features on the disc. The film is subtitled in Italian and the running time on the back seems to be incorrectly listed at 205 minutes. The movie actually runs around 215 minutes on my clock and is generally watchable despite being heavy fictionalized and somewhat hokey in spots.

Gigi Proietti does a nice job as St. Philip, but is limited somewhat by a dramatically inert script that leans toward fictional melodrama. Rather than getting a historical biopic on the 16th century Italian hermit who started a confraternity for young laymen in Rome, we get the tale of a holy and simple man who ended up caring for Rome's children after he was unable to join St. Ignatius of Loyola's new Jesuit order as a missionary to India. There is a charming scene early in the film where Philip meets Ignatius at the Jesuit headquarters, but unfortunately the film settles down into a lot of routine stuff after that, punctuated by goofy scenes of Philip levitating at the altar and Looney Tunes-esque battles (""I'll get you, you rabbit!"") with a cardinal who dislikes the saint for no particular reason other than plot convenience. The cardinal keeps popping up throughout the story, but never with any clear motivation or relevance to the story. Meanwhile, the title ""I Prefer Heaven"" finds its way into a song that Philip teaches his young students -- and which they continually sing throughout the rest of the story to create a simplistic theme or kind of mantra for the film. The tune is a bit annoying after awhile, but you've got to give the movie points for trying to be consistent.

If you accept the film as midrash rather than historical or biographical, it's a somewhat watchable diversion with some fun moments. The cute kiddie stuff in the first half wears thing quickly, but the second half of the movie (with the kids grown up) threatens to get somewhat interesting as Philip's oratory faces new challenges and dissensions within the group. Giorgio Campiotti, who directed the far superior ""Bakhita"" on that Sudanese slave-turned-saint, creates some beautiful cinematography on Italian locations and tries to muster some energy around these conflicts. Unfortunately, there is never any real peril in the story, as the artificial crises of a weak screenplay always find their resolution in a pat solution or pseudo-miraculous happening. Some of the stuff that happens in this movie is silly even by ""saint film"" standards, going well beyond the realm of plausibility, and may even be insulting in places to mature religious sensibilities. There's just no believable dramatic conflict at all here. There are also some profanities and adult themes in the story, not to mention the continual subtitles, making it a bit much for young English-speaking kids to follow despite the religious subject matter. Nevertheless, ""I Prefer Heaven"" offers an earnest and uplifting message that conveys the spirit of a popular Catholic saint, and may be worth investigating for that much alone. It also boasts the usual excellent productions values of these RAI television films, including some fine Italian actors.",1431216000,,3462,4.998266897746967

Saint Philip Neri: I Prefer Heaven represents what life really is and should be about on the screen.  The sacraments are dramatized throughout the film.  Some of the children take Holy Orders, and two are married.  The two that marry are born of disparate means, which emphasizes that true marriage is about love and mercy.  The Oratorio is a confraternity for both the sick and the poor, so there are many scenes in the film that show the priests caring for the sick, which the priests also do in the sacrament of the anointing of the sick.  Saint Philip Neri hears confessions throughout the film.  There is discusson of The Holy Eucharist.  And in a rare and brief sermon from Saint Philip Neri, he tells a story of a man that boasted of baptizing himself in The Name of The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit.  Many of the classic, Catholic movies that I have seen do not reveal so many aspects of what Catholics consider to be life as well as Saint Philip Neri: I prefer Heaven.

The setting for Saint Philip Neri: I Prefer Heaven is both historically accurate and artistically rendered. The film uses the Counter-Reformation to address some of the problems that Catholics must face in life.  Let's face it.  There have been some men of the cloth and laity that have not upheld the true light of the gospel.  Saint Philip Neri is forced to contend with people both inside and outside of his church that are against his purpose to help the poor, disadvantaged children of Rome.  Therefore, there is conflict portrayed between the sinners and saints within The Catholic Church.  However, the Pope and The Holy Catholic Church supported him in his endeavors to serve the sick and poor, despite the challenges within The Catholic Church.

The portrayal of Saint Philip Neri by Giacomo Campiotti (director) and Gigi Prorietti (actor) is fresh and inspiring.  Saint Philip Neri, apparently homeless, was set to be Jesuit with hopes of doing missionary work in India.  When he arrives in Rome, he meets with Saint Ignatius of Loyola, who gives Saint Philip Neri a copy of his book, Spiritual Exercises.  While homeless in Rome, Saint Philip Neri sees the poverty-stricken and homeless children, running wild and loose in the city.  While he waits for word on his mission to India, though the street children appear violent and very needy, stealing instead of begging, Saint Philip Neri invites them to learn about God along with the rich children who he is forced to teach.  Saint Philip Neri has a warm, welcoming way with everyone.  He is never aloof.  He is always engaging with the people around him in a humble and friendly manner, but he is never without challenging them in subtle and intriguing ways, giving the lost sinners room to think and come to their own conclusions.  I have yet to see a saint played in a film in such a down-to-earth manner.  However, Campiotti uses some magic-realism effects (i. e. Amelie) tastefully and sparingly throughout the film to show his otherworldliness.

This is not a musical, but I have been singing, ""Paradiso, Paradiso: preferisco paradiso"" out loud at home.  Do not worry; I live alone, so there is no one to offend.  Saint Philip Neri teaches the children, in a gentle and loving way, how to play nice.  Through his kindness, they are naturally attracted to him.  The children grow to become singers and scholars.  The viewer is able to see the children develop from 'criminals' to students to saints themselves.  The film does a great job of showing how this process becomes a reality.  When Saint Philip Neri is alone, he is praying, though he does not have much time to be alone, because he is constantly there to saintfully admonish, encourage and lead.  However, if you notice in the film, he does not spend anytime, admonishing the little ones; he just shows them a better way through his actions and by his lead.  After writing a book, one of his students is taught humility, when Saint Philip Neri asks him to work in the kitchen, despite the young man's academic success.  In a nice touch, we see the university scholars come to praise and recruit the young scholar, who, in turn, asks the scholars to help him in the everyday-type chores.  In an even nicer touch, the scholars catch on quickly and help the young scholar with his homely tasks.  In other gentle and leading ways, sinners are admonished and people are inspired in the light of the gospel, which is love and mercy, gained by humility and faithfulness.

I cannot say enough good things about this movie.  I hope that you enjoy it, as much as I did.",1399248000,3,4724,4.706455542021924

4854463,5,B005OT3FW2,"I like spiritual dvd's, and buy a lot of them. Although I'm not Catholic, I have quite a few Catholic dvd's I like - and this one tops the list as one of the most inspiring ones I've ever seen. It's spiritually moving, charming and entertaining all at once. The pamphlet that came with the dvd tells the actual life of St. Philip Neri, & it differs in some ways from the movie, but I don't have a problem with that since I felt the presence of a Saint in the movie.
I buy spiritual dvd's for inspiration and entertainment. I'm not necessarily interested in a strict adherence to the facts, as long as the spirit of the Saint is accurately depicted, and it is in this dvd. Also, the children in the movie were incredibly enchanting - sweet, cute, & in the case of Half Loaf, intimidating! They were spectacular actors - I couldn't take my eyes off them.
Lastly, the actor who played St. Philip Neri was as close to BEING St. Philip Neri as any actor could get! As I watched the film, there was no intermediate time between seeing the actor as an actor portraying a saint, and his ""being"" the saint. He  WAS the saint from the beginning.
Without hesitation, I strongly recommend this dvd. Oh, and did I say it was a top notch movie in every other way? It is.",1394755200,5,1256,4.29957805907173

4854469,3,B005OT3FW2,"this is a VERY old Italian film with not terribly clear sub titles--it is a very, very old flick. The acting is pretty good.

PS for the critic:  I'm not ""up to"" anything.  The movie I received and gave to my husband as a gift turned out to be a dated (ie old) old film that was colorized.  I can only report what I experience, and others what they experience.  Accusing another reviewer of being ""up to"" something is a rather strange way of expressing a different point of view.  If I didn't tell the truth as I experienced it, I would indeed be ""up to"" something--and that would be telling lies--something I don't and won't do, any more than I would accuse another reviewer of dishonesty",1372636800,,689,4.3858267716535435

4854475,5,B005OT3FW2,"I loved watching this beautiful movie about a priest who wants to be a missionary to India.  On faith, he goes to Rome to be assigned but is told 'no; by the Vatican.  He is not dismayed and akss God what His plans for him are now.  God leads him to the home of the pope's tailor who becomes his patron.  From there, he is introduced to the plight of the impoverished and orphaned youth who react to his ministry of love and hope for the poor youth.  Through his work, he gains enemies in the form of a local thug and an envious priest at the Vatican.  The joyful St. Philip de Neri never stops and works tirelessly to save the youth.  He never loses hope and always forgives those who hurt him. He is blessed with miracles but always remains humble. In time, he achieves his new dream to build a 'conservatorio' for the youth, wins over his enemies and trains his youth into adult leaders in the community.

I was taken by the love of this saintly man.  he never stopped and was obedient to God who dictated to him what He wanted him to do. Saint Philip de Neri carried on his life of service and always looked to heaven.  His saying, ""I prefer paradise"" became his mission's credo.  He was filled with joy and died  with a smile on his face.  This film was a joy to watch and experience.",1365292800,3,1289,4.2122448979591836

Philip Neri: The Fire of Joy by Paul Turks
The Roman Socrates by Louis Bouyer

St. Philip Neri didn't absolutize or universalize his unique spirituality, expecting others to do exactly what he did. But that said, once people came under his authority he pointed the direction.

He communicated by his playfulness so many things...how God looks at us, life is adventure, we can be brothers, the non-negotiable role of joy found in the presence of Jesus, and much more.

His love for lay preaching and appreciating the ways the Spirit works through our baptismal graces.

His non-conventional (considering the time period- and, in many ways, like the mind numbing preaching common today) preaching style of heart to heart simple and casual invitation into the greatest things.

He captivated people by novelty by his unexpected reactions and approaches to things. He understood Jesus did actually entertain- a thought that seems to offend the more serious of priests who themselves absolutize and place under a museum glass case public worship.

He was a man who loved solitude and then the extreme of putting people together- helping others make new best friends and companions on the journey.

What I really love is his causal approach to mysticism, prophecy, and signs and wonders. He treats them like the norm of Christian life (booyah!) but also as an obstacle to his responsibilities. Ha! Makes me laugh.

His heart was always made new by Jesus that he never came off as harsh, exceedingly annoyed or frustrated, preoccupied with anger at life's issues...and that newness only found in Jesus allowed him to get away with so much teasing, correcting, and crazy fun antics. I am sure he at times annoyed and made people mad...until they actually spent time with him.

He had a deep love of the early church, the desert fathers, the scriptures. He was in a sense the ""Anti-Luther"" by promoting, not weekly confession, but daily. If we are gonna say sorry at the end of the night to Jesus, might as well do it in the Sacrament. Its hard to have scrupulosity if we have a God who likes to forgive.

My sense is that his love of the martyrs and desire for mission was motivated by a love for martyrdom- an aspiration currently missing in today's common Catholic spirituality.

The freedom of Philip was born from his deep sense of identity as a son of the Father.  His mystical experiences were where his heart learned the depth of how much he was valued by God. There he would hear God say: You are worthy. Worldly failure is nothing to a God of victory- so he could get away with juggling with his feet a bishop's mitre when he was asked to be a bishop.

He wanted to be unfettered in general unless under obedience (his favorite virtue) because he liked God surprises- the twists and turns of divine appointments. And he also didn't want to put rules on people because he was excited to see the best come out of them on their own.

He is the Saint for today!",1526688000,,3106,4.6611721611721615
