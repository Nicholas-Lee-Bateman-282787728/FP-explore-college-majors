7919153,3,B00003M5HA,I chose this rating because it was so far my least favorite of all Laurel and Hardy films.  It is the only Laurel and Hardy film I have seen so far where the boys do not play a major role. Because they do not appear until the middle of the film I thought at first perhaps I bought the wrong tape.,1383523200,,296,3.8524590163934427
