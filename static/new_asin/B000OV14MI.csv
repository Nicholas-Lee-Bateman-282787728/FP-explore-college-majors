The tension builds, and it seems that Ayuki has an unrequited love of her won.

This anime is getting better. The story gets more interesting as it progresses. This anime has good animation, voice acting, and a good soundtrack as well. When I said it has a good voice cast, I meant the Japanese version. I have the version with Japanese and English. The English dub isn't very good, but I have heard worse. The characters are great, and the drama is interesting. This is a different and fun series to watch. But I don't think it's is 5 star series.",1356998400,,897,4.60625
