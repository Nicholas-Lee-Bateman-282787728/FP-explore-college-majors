8101686,3,B000CSCXTG,"In this episode you get a side tour into Rick Strassmans DMT research into DMT that most of you probably are already aware of.

You also get to look at Lon Milo Duquette repeat himself for about ten minutes.  It just left me thinking ""Am I dreaming"".  (you'll get the pun if you watch the video.)

Basically this episode just says that the training in the book of Ani, along with meditation and training of the will, would likely/possibly allow the continuation of the persona beyond death.  Period.",1390953600,,499,4.625

8101689,5,B000CSCXTG,"This fifth episode of the Magical Egypt series, a symbolist tour of ancient Egypt, gets down to the heart of the matter as far as the ancient Egyptians are concerned - their strong belief in an afterlife.  This belief basically fueled everything the ancient Egyptians did, particularly in terms of the monuments they left us.  Host John Anthony West takes us into the New Kingdom tomb of Tuthmosis III, which houses the complete text of the Amduat on its walls.  The Amduat is basically a guidebook to the Afterlife, containing all the knowledge a dead pharaoh would need in order to ascend to godhood.  There were twelve hours (stages) in one's progression through the Afterlife, and many spells and secrets were required to pass all the way through to the ultimate goal.  West basically walks us through each stage, giving his interpretation of the funerary text on the walls themselves.

Focusing particularly on one depiction, in which the risen sun of the higher consciousness appears, West argues that the location of the risen sun corresponds with that of the Third Eye in a human being.  I find this to be a questionable extrapolation, but it does at least make some degree of sense.  It also leads the viewer into a new phase of the discussion, one centering on the pineal gland in the brain.  Little understood by modern scientists, the gland has long been associated with mystical states of consciousness (the third eye, the sixth chakra); Descartes called it ""the seat of the soul.""  According to the research of Robert Strassman, a molecule called DMT, which is associated with the pineal gland, may actually provide a doorway for transfer of the spirit out of the body.  DMT is an hallucinogen that may be released by the pineal gland during times of extreme stress, and experiments have shown that individuals with abnormally high levels of DMT experience alternate states of consciousness, including experiences of an afterlife, and encounter both helpful and malevolent beings therein.  Since few things are as stressful as a person's dying moments, it makes sense to conclude that DMT would be released in abundance at such a time, thereby conceivably bringing about a separation of body and soul in the individual.

From here, we get into a discussion on lucid dreams and how they might relate to all of this seemingly disparate information.  Lon Milo Duquette, a most entertaining interview subject, discusses how a person with a strong mind can condition himself to recognize and take control of his dreams.  Such lucid dreams, he suggests, are not unlike visions associated with near-death experiences, which begs the question: what if you could somehow maintain your consciousness through the death experience?  Such a state of continuous, higher-level consciousness would conceivably allow you to effectively cheat death.  Perhaps all of the spells and secrets that the pharaohs needed to learn in order to ascend to the gods after death served to train their minds to achieve just such a state of continuous consciousness.

John Anthony West, throughout his research, has done what most modern scholars do not do - examine the issues from an ancient Egyptian point of view.  Rather than dismiss Egyptian funerary texts as the products of wild superstition, he leaves open the possibility that this ancient culture might have known what it was talking about.  His What if? approach to Egyptology makes him unpopular with many of his fellow academics but provides him - and now us - with a fresh, sometimes illuminating, and always fascinating window on ancient history.",1152748800,10,3593,5.037162162162162
