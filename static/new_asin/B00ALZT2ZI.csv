Since most people are familiar with Ms. Swanson because of her terrific performance in ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1950), one tends to think she was only good at tragedy and drama.

WRONG.

I must confess I was one of those people, then I decided to get more familiar with Ms. Swanson work in silent comedies, and what I saw couldn't be more pleasant! ""Fine Manners"" (1926) is an excellent example of what she could do and how versatile an actress she could be. Not only was she stunning, but her screen presence had such a unique, irresistible quality that -despite this sounds clich- you just can't take your eyes off her when she's on screen. Her gorgeous eyes and luminous smile are enough to recommend this movie, but there are plenty of other good stuff in it, despite it runs for a little more than one hour.

In ""Fine Manners"", Gloria plays a Broadway chorist whose endless charms make a millionaire totally fall for her during a New Year Eve celebration. Everything goes fine till, after a short time, he introduces her to his only relative, a prissy aunt who kind of gets shocked by the ""scandalous"" behaviour of the girl. Regardless, she's willing to accept the relationship after asking Orchid (Gloria's character) to move into her mansion to give her a six-month lesson of ""how to be a lady"" while the leading man is in South America, so she'll be able to do a good job in high society as his wife once he's come back.

If you like silents and Gloria Swanson, you just can't miss out this one. Despite it's hardly restored, the print quality of the Grapevine DVD is quite good and more than watchable, and it also has an organ score that fits well all the scenes.

I've read once that the great Ms. Swanson wanted to be remembered as a comedienne more than anything else, and now I can understand why. She was definitely NOT ""Norma Desmond"", but a tremendous and down-to-earth actress that could do anything and be equally good either on drama or comedy. Thanks to great releases like this one, we can witness her great talent and be more appreciative of a legacy that deserves to be re-discovered.",1415491200,9,2418,4.940886699507389
