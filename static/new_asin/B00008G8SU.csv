7983889,2,B00008G8SU,"""Hard Hunted"" has all the qualities you'd expect in an Andy Sidaris movie, the two most prominent of which are guns and girls. While those two attributes are here in spades, it's honestly one of the more boring Sidaris films, and the dialogue and acting are so bad as to become tiresome extremely quickly no matter what's on the screen. This one stars Dona Speir as Donna and Roberta Vasquez as Nicole again. They are still undercover government agents, this time trying via long and convoluted happenstance to stop the evil Kane (R. J. Moore) from getting a trigger for a nuclear bomb that's encased in a jade Buddha. Singing agent Edy (Cynthia Brimhall) is back too, as is fellow Sidaris regular Rodrigo Obregon as Pico.

The ""Klystron relay"" which could set of a nuclear war in the Middle East is for sale to the highest bidder, and Kane is ruthless in his pursuit of it and the profits it can bring on the black market. There is one particular annoyance I have with this movie, and it's the horrid KSXY radio on-air talent who gives romantic advice and coded messages to Donna over the airwaves. This wasn't funny or clever the first time it happened, and it got increasingly annoying as the movie went on. Unlike most Sidaris films, this one takes 24 minutes to unveil the first machine gun, but it's a doozy. It's being carried in a ridiculous little gyrocopter flown by an evil Japanese assassin wearing a rising sun bandana. Even after it rains death from the sky, there's always time for a soak in the Jacuzzi and a quick trip to Sedona, Arizona because the KSXY lady said so. Whatever.

Donna and Nicole fly their trusty Cessna 172 to Molokai, and despite the extreme peril of being alone on the tarmac, a Pepto-Bismol colored Cessna swoops in and kidnaps Donna. Donna wrestles around in the plane with her two captors, and detonates a grenade in the plane and bails out with a purloined parachute. She lands hard and gets amnesia from the fall from the sky. She is immediately taken hostage by Pico (Obregon) and company. Will she get her memory back and escape? What do you think? Obregon is probably the best actor in the film, but even he can't save this scene. There is a subplot about Donna disassembling a gun and reassembling it while the guy she wants to use it on sort of just watches her mad field stripping skills. Yawn.

Because the only truly bizarre mode of transportation in this movie so far has been the gyrocopter, experienced Sidaris viewers will know they're due for another one, and that brings us to the highlight of the film: inept assassins Wiley and Coyote (yes, really), armed with Acme brand machine guns, drive their Acme Hovercraft (Model A33Z) on a mission to shoot Edy (Oh, please, oh please, oh please!) and her beau while they are sitting in the open at a picnic table by water's edge. I do not wish to give away too much, but the action scene that follows involves a fishing rod, an exploding high heel shoe, and the Acme hovercraft. I would have assuredly given this film one star without this comedic interlude.

There's more random romance set to bad synth music, a double-cross that you can't not see coming, and more of that KSXY ""Loveline"" nonsense that wears out its welcome fast. Of course Donna gets rescued right as the gyrocopter shows up for more death and destruction. The scene where the gyrocopter resting peacefully on the ground threatens Donna and company sufficiently to put down their guns and surrender the Buddha is really scraping the bottom of the dramatic device barrel, but I guess it advances the plot. Once it takes off with trigger on board she neatly dispatches it with a machine gun while Kane fumes in his yacht just offshore. As the police boats converge on the yacht they...let Kane go...ponder...and say they'll be seeing him again. Yeah, no doubt. Hopefully in a movie better than this one.

This is not a good movie, and certainly isn't one of Andy Sidaris' best. If you want to see a Sidaris film, try ""Picasso Trigger"" or even ""Savage Beach""; they still have Dona Speir but they also have Hope Marie Carlton, whose presence is sorely missed here, and they are simply more fun. This is for Sidaris completists only.",1469836800,,4198,4.637096774193548
7983890,5,B00008G8SU,"This B movie had it all! Sex, violence, romance, sex and did I mention there was sex?

Dona Speir's character was ruthless. She showed no mercy to those poor guys on the piper cub! She beat one dude unconscious and then threw him from the airplane! The poor dude never knew what hit him and never would awake from the slumber she put him in! Then took and detonated a grenade in the plane, killing the hapless pilot as he begged for his life. Jumping from the lane she landed and was knocked unconscious herself only to be captured by white slavers where she suffers from amnesia.

Cole the double agent found her and seduced her but in the end she skewered him with a dagger while looking into his face and saying ""I faked that orgasm!"" Wow! I'll never forget that scene. I wouldn't want to mess with her!

This was  a movie filled with beautiful women. I can honestly tell you I truly enjoyed it and I recommend it to anyone who likes action-packed sexual adventures! I loved the busty Roberta Vasquez too! She was fine!

7983892,3,B00008G8SU,"Hard Hunted is another Andy Sidaris tittie flick with some action thrown in, as well as some boring mumbo jumbo. I honestly don't know why this movie needed a plot, because it got in the way of what we really wanted to see: Hot women shooting bad guys while wearing next to nothing. Sure, we get that, but not near as much as I had hoped. This one's okay, but for better Sidaris movies, try Hard Ticket To Hawaii, Day of the Warrior, and Return to Savage Beach.",1302566400,,461,4.25
