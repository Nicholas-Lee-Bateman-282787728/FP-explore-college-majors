8262800,2,B0016JRMOG,This movie didn't even make sense. They tried to make a chicano Friday version. The actors don't know how to act.,1500422400,,113,4.428571428571429
8262801,5,B0016JRMOG,"This is one of a kind of funny chicano movie with its own style with a different type of story. Good movies are hard to find this days so this one is a must have original copy not a bootlegged one for your personal library. Its well worth
spending a few bucks on it you won't regret it. A good flick for RAZA out there.",1459641600,,319,3.923076923076923

8262805,3,B0016JRMOG,"Apparently made with Los Angeles actors of Hispanic descent
this comedy is in English, with only a few Spanish words here and there.
 Technical credits are good.  Acting is excellent.  The only letdown
is some mediocre music here and there.",1358294400,,240,4.95
8262806,4,B0016JRMOG,"It's one of those cheezy, low budget movies, but for some reason, I started watching 15 minutes of it, and then it turn into 2 hours.. Funny stuff. It reminded me of a real low budget Friday, with some funny cholos.. just like in Friday. Get it you won't be dissapointed..",1325721600,4,272,4.352941176470588
