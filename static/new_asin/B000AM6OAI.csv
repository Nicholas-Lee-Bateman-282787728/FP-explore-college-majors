8177769,5,B000AM6OAI,I love pokemon and season 7 was one of my favorite seasons and the first volume contains Misty's return for a guess appearance. The only sad thing is Togepi was written out.,1350777600,,173,4.4375
8177770,5,B000AM6OAI,"To pick up where the Pokemon ""Advanced"" Season left off, ""Advanced Challenge"" offers Pokemon fans more exciting adventures, featuring Ash, Pikachu, Brock, May, and Max! Plus, any DVD that features five episodes or more, in my book, is a winner. :)

Here are some comments and observations I had, regarding each of the episodes:

""What You Seed is What You Get:"" It is never explained as to whether the Electrode featured is really the color of a watermelon or painted to look like one. Do watermelons really have THAT many seeds to provide for Bullet Seed practice? :) Team Rocket's Cachnea machine is a scream!

""Love at First Flight:"" Two hilarious quotes stand out for me ... Ash: ""Romeo, you sound sick. I think you should get to a hospital right now!""/Brock: ""With your smashing good looks, Juliet, you're already a success!"" :) The ""dizzy"" group of Ash, Pikachu, and the guest Pokemon, after they fall to the ground, near the end of the episode, made for an amusing moment, too. :)

""Let Bagons Be Bagons:"" I find Michelle to be one of the most attractive female anim characters in the Pokemon series, but it is unusual that she talks like Max! I get a kick out of her reaction to Brock: ""Are you all right?"" :) James' dialog as pilot is classic: ""Whoa! Trying to drive here!""/""This is the Captain ... Lunch will not be served today!"" Meowth flying aimlessly on the jet pack was hilarious, too!

""The Princess and the Togepi:"" Misty's new uniform is pretty neat ... Cool hiking boots! Her reaction to Hanson's Pokemon is priceless, as is Team Rocket accenting the first half of their motto! Blast from the past for Brock: ""Not the ear!"" :)

""A Togepi Mirage!:"" Humorous dialog from May and Ash, respectively, once again: ""You might not believe it, but Ash has been known to really come though in times like this. So...""/""Why wouldn't she believe it?!"" :) At one point, later in the episode, Ash wonders about when Misty learned how to handle a certain Pokemon that is showcased for the scene ... What I wanted to know was WHERE and HOW Misty caught this particular Pokemon?! You'll be surprised if you never saw this episode before! Also, check out a slightly different voice used for the Togepi near the end of the episode. :)

There is only one negative point to this DVD (This includes all of the DVD volumes for this Season of Pokemon) ... Under the ""Bonus Features"" menu, both the opening and closing themes are featured, yet they are already featured within each of the individual episodes, so to feature the exact same thing again, in a bonus feature, is redundant. However, this sort of thing doesn't really bother me as it might other fans of the Pokemon series who expect more from bonus features, and it doesn't take away from my overall rating on this release ... I just had to mention this to upcoming purchasers of the Pokemon ""Advanced Challenge"" series who have high expectations upon checking out the bonus features. Fortunately, there is a positive point to the ""Bonus Features"" section, and this includes brief descriptions of a couple of the upcoming ""Advanced Challenge"" episodes from future DVD releases ... That was nice. :)

*Before I close, note that there are a couple of differences between the opening and closing themes of ""Advanced Challenge"" ... In the intro, there is footage of Drew and Roselia, but during the ending sequence, the footage is replaced by a shot of Professor Oak, Ash's Mother, and Tracy. Also, the tail-end of the closing theme features a far-off image of the heroes, with each character facing in a different direction. Usually, in Seasons past, the Pokemon ending themes are edited versions of the opening themes, but on this occasion, there are some subtle differences between the two! :)

In closing, I have to say that everyone who contributed in making the Pokemon episodes and the DVD sets did a fantastic job! :) Thanks for reading! God Bless...
