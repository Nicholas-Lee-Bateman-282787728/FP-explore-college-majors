8442555,4,B004V2FU62,"Vinashak is a bollywood action thriller. As a Sunil Shetty starrer, Vinashak goes beyond the expectations of those who are prejudiced towards him,I must say. The film,in general is about an honest cop's battle against the corrupt law,after losing his near and dear ones in fighting the wicked. This may sound similar to many films,but this one has good dialogs and excellent action sequences unlike the fake ones in the other films,and the plot is good. Music is average,choreography unremarkable. Sunil Shetty and Om Puri act their roles well,Danny is OK as the villain. You can watch this. It's not a waste of time. But don't be prejudiced. Another remarkable film of Sunil Shetty",1306281600,,682,4.991228070175438
