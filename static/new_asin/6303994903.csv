752036,4,6303994903,"I have two other Firm videos and I feel the difference.  My only pet peeve with Lower Body is that the actual workout is only 20-22 minutes, while the Standing Legs workout is about 35 minutes.  I'd hoped for the same amount of time with Lower Body.  There is plenty of bridge and table work, but I felt that there could've been more inner/outer thigh concentration, too.  Overall, I'd recommend this DVD.",1375660800,5,405,4.583333333333333
752037,5,6303994903,I love this workout routine. The item arrived quickly for which I was pleased with. The only thing is the tape skips a small part at the end. :-(,1361750400,,145,4.0344827586206895
752038,5,6303994903,"I used to workout to this video in the 1990's and loved it then. Recently, I was looking for something like this video, but couldn't find anything quite as good. So I searched for it on Amazon and found it amazingly. It is just as fantastic as I remembered. My lower body is feeling firmer already!",1326844800,9,298,4.339285714285714
752039,4,6303994903,"This workout contains lower body floorwork from the classic Firm Volumes 1-6.  There is a good variety here, bridgework and tablework for the hamstrings and behind, plus inner and outer thigh work as well.  There is also some pelvic floor work included in the last lower body segment before the cooldown.  All the segments include the use of ankle weights or dumbells sometimes both, but the exercises could be performed easily without either and still be effective.  In one segment you will even see the use of toe weights which were sold by the Firm years ago.

This workout is just short of 30 minutes including warmup and cooldown.  Even though I have had this workout for many years, looking back on it I am surprised there weren't more clips from volume 1 which is famous for it's lower body floorwork section.  Most of the clips from this video are from volume 3.

Regardless this is a good choice if you are looking for a lower body workout with good variety that hits all the muscles of your backside thoroughly.  This workout is also known as Floor Legs, which it was called before being renamed ""Lower Body Sculpting"".",1143936000,10,1129,4.661616161616162
752040,4,6303994903,"Basically they pieced together parts of other workouts together to make one focused on the lower body.  It's a pretty easy way to use editing to sell another tape!  Some of the instructors are cool and down-to-earth, while some of the others  seem annoyingly seductive.
I do my best to get over the annoyances mentioned above,  though, beause it's a pretty good leg workout.",1083542400,3,374,4.796875
752041,5,6303994903,"This tape, and the whole ""The Firm"" exercise tapes, are the best I have found! I have worked out all my life doing cardio. However, I needed something to shape and form my lower body! This tape is Awesome! It doesn't take much time and I saw results in just two weeks! It really helped to sculpt my Legs and Buttocks FAST! It is designed for all levels of excercisers, for those just starting out or those who want to do the tape with weights!",996624000,12,443,4.223529411764706
752042,3,6303994903,"This is a great workout to do whenever you don't want to do something really strenous. However, it lacks the intensity of ""The Firm: Standing Legs"" video.
The exercises are done really quick and it requires heavier weights than normal.",975283200,12,235,4.9
752043,5,6303994903,"I started using the Firm Lower Body Sculpting since 1997 and I have seen the best results.  When they say results in 10 workouts, it is true.  I have since bought 4 more tapes and they are all very challenging and I have  seen results.  I suggest these tapes for anyone trying to tone and lose  weight the right way.",947030400,17,316,4.2

7858316,5,6303994903,"owned this on tape and now that wore out, I got it on DVD.  Its a nice quick workout that really focuses on lower body and esp legs.  aside from opening warmup, the rest, you are on the floor doing moves with optional dumbells and ankel weights...but really not needed to still feel affect of workout.  Highly recommend this to add to a workout or in time crunch to say you did something that day",1470787200,3,396,4.253333333333333
7858317,5,6303994903,This exercise video will tone and firm your body in no time.  My mom and I used to do this work out on VHS.  So glad that we found it on DVD since VHS is a thing of the past!,1463184000,,174,3.325
7858318,5,6303994903,For years I have struggled with sculpting my lower body but with The Firm Parts Lower Body Sculpting DVD I no longer struggle.,1448841600,2,126,4.521739130434782
7858319,5,6303994903,"This is a compilation of the original Firm workouts.  It really targets the lower torso, and gives fast results.  The moves are intense, but not too tough.  Absolutely love it!",1411862400,4,176,4.8
7858320,5,6303994903,"This  workout  will  put  ""the  Whup""  on  you.  The beauty  of  all the Firm  exercise  tapes  is  they  don't  waste  time .and  are  so  super  effective.  No  false  advertizing.  You'll  feel  stronger  after  any of  the  original Firm  workouts. I  started  with  the Firm when they first  appeared on the  scene in the 80's. also  you  never  out grow  the  exercises.  I'll  always  love  them.",1402099200,,403,4.507692307692308
7858321,5,6303994903,"Every minute is worth the effort put into working out. Cues are on time, monitored so every level can achieve results from this.  Use of 2-3 times a week including a mixture of  other activities you love aerobics, swimming,  tennis bring quicker results.",1400371200,5,254,4.8604651162790695
7858322,5,6303994903,"I am a former personal trainer, and I bought the video version of this workout in the 90's when it was called Firm Parts: Floor Legs, and I was so disappointed when I could not find it on DVD. I somehow discovered that it had been renamed to Lower Body Sculpting and was now available on DVD. This is a very effective workout, especially when alternated with the Firm Parts: Standing Legs DVD. The warm-up is an excellent dynamic warm-up and gets your legs ready to move. I do skip the stretch as it is not necessary and actually reverses the blood-flowing effects of the warm-up. The bridge work and side-lying leg raises and sweeps are very effective in working the often overlooked muscles of the inner thigh and glutes. (There is no ""outer thigh"" muscle-- you're working your glutes.)

For equipment, you'll need ankle weights, dumbbells and a mat. The workout takes about 20-25 minutes. I've been doing it once a week and have seen very good results.

Note: The price for a new DVD is pretty steep. I bought a used one in excellent condition through Amazon.",1392249600,12,1062,4.613756613756614
