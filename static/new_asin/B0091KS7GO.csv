5242274,5,B0091KS7GO,I love this dvd set. i felt my abs contract and were sore after the first day of using the dvd. it is very helpful,1388620800,,114,3.6
5242275,5,B0091KS7GO,WOW!  This set is awesome.  Never get bored doing the same workout over and over again.  It is also great because I have 5 kiddos and only have 30 minutes to workout.,1380931200,2,166,4.125
5242276,4,B0091KS7GO,"Love this DVD set. Purchased the Bootcamp I
DVD while pregnant with my daughter for post pregnancy and this one recently for more of a challenge.
I also own a Jillian michaels DVD & would compare it to that. Its a non-stop workout of compound movements for a minute each. Totaling 10 mins each workout.
  I like that she modifys it for different fitness levels & explains each exercise. Talking you through it & reminding you of what you should be doing.
The only drawback is there is not as much variety as her Bootcamp I DVD but the workouts are more intense. I would recommend getting both.

  The core DVD is good for anyone with Diastis Recti ( like me ) or just to learn new/ correct ways to tone your abs from the inside out.",1369785600,4,732,4.313868613138686
5242277,5,B0091KS7GO,"I LOVE this postnatal boot camp. Before I got pregnant I was big into insanity and p90x. I wanted to start off slow before getting back into my old routine of workouts. Now, I don't know if i will because I love her 10 minutes sections and 3 minute ab work outs. they are VERY challenging, but also show modifications. The Core firing sequence method I was a little disappointed with, it was more as 'homework' but at the same time, good way to constantly be using the core, not jsut during exercises.",1366848000,,501,4.397849462365591
5242278,5,B0091KS7GO,"I purchased this set after I had my 3rd baby.  With my first baby, I put on 70 pounds!  I never lost the weight fully and then had two more babies.  By the time my 3rd (and final) child was born, I was very overweight and ready to make some serious changes in my life!  This was the perfect fit for me!  I was able to pop in the DVD when I had time, it was perfectly tailored for what I needed after having a baby, and I never got bored! I looked forward to every workout (and this is so not like me at all!).  I was able to achieve my goals and have fun while doing it!

Once I met my first goal and my youngest turned 5 months old, I moved to the advanced set!  It totally exceeded my expectations!  It was so much fun! Like the basic, it was challenging in all the right ways, I so looked forward to each workout! I met my overall goal and now feel so great and look better than I ever had! I am so thankful I found this! It changed my life!",1358294400,4,944,3.8247422680412373
5242279,5,B0091KS7GO,"I lost 55 pounds after having my baby, 30 was baby weight and 25 was extra weight I gained during the pregnancy.  This exercise system was a huge influence on me. It helped me get my shape back after my second child and I have kept it off for almost two years.

This DVD really worked for me. It has a good set of exercises, with clear explanations and examples of how to do them properly.  I was able to build up to more challenging ones as my abs got stronger. As far as I am concerned, this fitness plan works; but you have to do the work.  I saw results within a week, but I was also watching my diets as well.  This is an excellent workout I would recommend to anyone.",1353715200,5,673,4.030075187969925
5242280,1,B0091KS7GO,"I ordered the PostNatal Bootcamp and got the Advanced Boot Camp.  It seems like a great workout, but I need the beginner level.  So I have to spend more money to get the correct one.  It is really frustrating when I am trying to get into shape and now have to wait for the right tape to get started.  I did try the advanced one and had to stop half way through.  But it seemed like a great workout.  I am just not ready for it.",1351900800,,427,3.9069767441860463
8534305,2,B0091KS7GO,Wasn't the biggest fan of the DVDs. I felt they were kind of cheesy and unmotivating.,1464307200,,85,4.375
8534306,5,B0091KS7GO,i love these dvds. they are great for a post partum mother starting from the bottom and gradually working your way up to do full and vigorous exercises!,1452816000,,152,4.464285714285714
8534307,4,B0091KS7GO,"The ""bootcamp"" premise is a little cheesy, but it's a good total body workout for a new mom who hasn't exercised in ten months!",1441756800,,127,4.333333333333333
8534308,1,B0091KS7GO,"I bought this to help with my diastasis recti. Her website says this and the other dvd will help with that, and I dumbly went for it. Upon doing more research 1/2 or more of the workouts you SHOULD NOT be doing with diastasis recti. Just spend the extra money and get the MuTu system thats been verified.
I just wish I didn't wait so long so I could return it.",1422576000,,360,4.084507042253521
8534309,5,B0091KS7GO,Awesome workouts that build upon your strength and level of ability,1411257600,,67,5.181818181818182
8534310,1,B0091KS7GO,"The ""Core Firing Sequence Method"" DVD is defective.  It won't let me progress beyond the menu.  I haven't tried the other DVD yet :-(.",1411084800,,134,4.541666666666667
8534311,5,B0091KS7GO,great workout. Love the variety and the disc is easy to use. Definitely recommend this one,1406246400,,90,4.6875
8534312,5,B0091KS7GO,"My wife apparently used my Amazon account to order this DVD. I know she's used it multiple times because I've caught my 2 year old trying to imitate the moves and call it ""exercise.""

It must work, because a few months after having our last kid, she was back to looking smokin' hot and in better shape than me. And I'm in the Army. How embarrassing.",1405209600,3,349,4.287878787878788
8534313,4,B0091KS7GO,"She did some research on forums before asking me to buy it.
This is the upgraded version from the original, which is better, said she.",1401926400,,134,4.4
8534314,5,B0091KS7GO,I can see change in my abs in 2 weeks...I love the different levels of doing same exercise and it seems very effective by doing at my own pace in my own time,1392163200,2,157,3.787878787878788
