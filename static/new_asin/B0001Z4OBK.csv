I get the point about Tai Chi anywhere, but I think you should have something better than reality TV in your doctors waiting room.  You won't learn much here.  There are really no stellar Tai Chi DVDs that aren't from YMAA, this one is decent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Intro-to-Tai-Chi/dp/B009GGWWCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Intro to Tai Chi</a>.

8018593,4,B0001Z4OBK,"I like this much more than the ""Tai Chi for Older Adults"". The moves are basic, but not too slow or boring. It is the best of three we have tried. It's easy to follow, and the warm up exercises are beneficial on their own. Great for relieving stiffness and working on flexibility and balance. Like another customer, we previously rented this from Netflix and also kept it for several weeks because we liked it.  It is not an easy version to find to purchase but well worth it when you do.  This was a used copy but in excellent condition.",1310083200,5,538,4.316831683168317
8018594,1,B0001Z4OBK,I did not like this video at all it was the most expensive one I bought and I really was disapointed.  I guess if you knew nothing at all about tai chi maybe you would appreciate it but I was not impressed at all.,1158796800,4,213,3.840909090909091
8018595,1,B0001Z4OBK,"Don't waste your money on this!  I paid $25 for this piece of crap!!!  It's dull, slow and very very boring, not to mention hard to follow.  The sound quality was horrible too.  David Carradine was on one of the PBS channels and I taped part of his demonstrations, what little segment I taped was a 100% better then the entired Dr. Tam DVD.  Don't buy it!",1111536000,4,355,4.2388059701492535
8018596,3,B0001Z4OBK,"He explains all the motions very easy and clear, you for sure understand everything well. But i can't believe that the whole instruction is filmed in a little room in front of a couple of chairs and frames etc. in the back. Couldn't they pick a better place and a little more professional camera.

But besides this the instruction is definitely very good and understandable...",1093219200,12,376,4.7846153846153845
8018597,5,B0001Z4OBK,"I became interested in T'ai Chi just recently and I was recomended this video by friends. This is the perfect video for instruction. Just so you know this isn't a workout tape, this is set as instructions only. Which is a relife in itself because you don't have the feeling of needing to continue. I took my time with this video and feel it is certainly paying off. I feel more relaxed and more limber. I recomend this video for anyone just starting T'ai Chi because its a very easy flowing video.",997920000,14,497,4.413043478260869
8018598,5,B0001Z4OBK,"Outstanding instructional video with precise, easy to follow guidance, from the experienced Tai Chi master and physician Dr. Paul Lam.  The video includes warm-up and wind-down exercises; as well as the eleven movements of the Sun Style Tai Chi Forms. Dr. Lam also shows you how to make up your own combinations.  I purchased this video knowing nothing about Tai Chi and found that Dr Lam is an excellent teacher.  The Sun Style Tai Chi Forms can be adapted to suit almost any situation, space or time.
I highly recommed this video for the beginner or advanced student.",976665600,19,569,4.785714285714286
