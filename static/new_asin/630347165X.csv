7850140,5,630347165X,One of the best DVDs,1430870400,,20,3.2
7850141,5,630347165X,"This is a black and white VHS of four segments which are: Disorder in the Court, Brideless Groom, Malice in the Palace, and Sing a Song of Six Pants.

These are the original Three Stooges from waaaaaaaaaaay back, not a remake.  It's called the Three Stooges but actually all four are in different segments--Larry, Moe, Curly, and Shemp.

Running time is about 55 minutes total.  For the price it's great for the old slapstick laughs!",1365984000,,433,4.733333333333333
7850142,3,630347165X,"This is another in a never-ending parade of budget releases of their four public domain shorts. If you're short on cash, and NEED some Stooges material, this is the best budget release of the ""four"" that I've seen. The picture and sound are, of course, substandard, but very much viewable. For $5, you can't go wrong! There is a regular-quality version of these shorts out on Fox, with color and B&W versions, for around $10, so get that one if you can spare the cash, as it has the ONLY regular-quality versions of the three Shemp episodes (""Disorder In The Court"" is available on Columbia)!!! The Shemp ones are: ""Sing A Song Of Six Pants"",""Brideless Groom"" and ""Malice In The Palace"".",1136246400,3,687,4.68595041322314
7850143,5,630347165X,"I liked this one a lot but found it to be to short. You really needed to be familiar with the history of the Stooges to follow the film. They could have developed Larry and Curly a lot more than they did.

They really glossed over the Healy years and could have done more there tool. They ended the film abruptly at the comeback but do not show the feature films or the cartoon series. The very end also told you what happened to each Stooge but it flashed so fast that I was only able to read about half.

They did an excellent job recreating scenes from the shorts that we know. It was interesting that the foley work was done instantaneously, unlike today where it could be done over a period of months in a studio.

One thing I remember in Moe's book which was not shown was the day Curly suffered his stroke, the heartless executives insisted that Moe and Larry finish the short they were working on later in the same afternoon! You might remember that one as a big pie fight that doesn't have Curly in it.

Curly did appear briefly in one of the Shemp shorts as a sleeping passenger on a train.

I know there was big animosity to Joe Besser and that Moe had always wanted Joe De Rita to be the third Stooge. This was shown well in the film.",1107993600,4,1246,4.196652719665272
