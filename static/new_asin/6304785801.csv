The video portion of the movie appears to have been a Japanese Action/Adventure movie featuring a swinging James Bond-type hero surrounded by beautiful women and rival gangsters.  Allen has dubbed the movie and has changed the plot, from what was probably a typical 007 scheme, to a scavenger hunt for a secret egg salad recipe!  Allen interupts the film on a few occasions to provide commentary, and also splices in a couple of psychadelic rock (mock?) videos.  I think you will agree that this is another testament to Allen's artistic versatility and comic genius.  This is a very funny movie.  END",896140800,3,696,4.9655172413793105

924396,3,6304785801,"The movie stars with Woody Allen (playing himself) being interviewed for the premiere of his new movie, Whats Up, Tiger Lily?  Woody says, We wanted in Hollywood to make the definitive spy picture. And they came to me to supervise the project because, I think that if you know me at all, you know that death is my bread and danger my butter  oh no. danger is my bread and death is my butter. Death and danger are my various breads and various butters.

After this introduction, we get to watch the movie, starring A No Star Cast. Its a Japanese spy movie with new dialogue dubbed over. Two criminal factions vie for the greatest egg salad recipe. Its James Bond to the max, danger and butter all in one.

There is some funny dialogue, such as when the suave spy with a mustache says to the threatening croupier, Dont tell me what I can do. Or Ill have my mustache eat your ear.

Ok, maybe you had to be there.

Im going to be up front  I am not a huge Woody Allen fan. For whatever reason, his movies seem average to me. Perhaps its the difference in senses of humor. Maybe I just don't have enough class. In any case, I only recently viewed Whats Up Tiger Lily? and it hasn't changed my mind about Woody Allen movies.

In case you didn't know, Woody Allen himself was not happy with the theatrical release of Whats Up, Tiger Lily? Originally, it was a one-hour made-for-TV film. The producers wanted a theatrical release, but it had to be longer. Without Allens approval, they added all the scenes and video of The Lovin Spoonful. So, I cannot blame Woody for that.

The original Japanese film is titled International Secret Police: Key of Keys. It was so successful that it became the first of a trilogy. When Allen first put together his movie, he chose certain scenes, and sometimes used them out of order.

Louise Lasser was married to Woody a the time. She, and 5 others, co-wrote Whats Up Tiger Lily? with Woody. In addition, she performed some of the funniest voice acting.

I will admit that I did laugh at parts of the movie. But its the kind of stunt that is difficult to maintain throughout a whole feature film. Perhaps I would have been more appreciative of the original 50-minute show. Overall, it is an OK movie for me = 3 stars.

924520,1,6304785801,"What's Up, Tiger Lily? (Woody Allen, 1966)

I am one of those people who has never ""gotten"" the humor of Woody Allen, and the more of his movies I watch in a misguided attempt to get it, the more I realize that will probably never happen. My most recent brush with Allen was his first movie--if you can call it that.

What's Up, Tiger Lily? starts off with a brief interview with Allen where he describes the process of what we would call today repurposing the film International Secret Police: Key of Keys by adding a different voice-dub track. To cut short all of the aimless fluff that would normally follow that in a review, I'll just tell you the end result: what you get is a Woody Allen movie without the visuals. In effect, it's a concentrated dose of Woody Allen: if you like his jokes, you'll probably like this movie, though the IMDB forum for the film is full of people who otherwise seem to adore Woody Allen but consider this movie boring. On the other hand, if you're not an Allen fan, this is going to seem even worse than his usual fare, as it was for me. It's a personal thing, I guess; comedy, like horror, is different for everyone, and when it misses, it really misses. That's the case here for me. Your mileage may vary. *",1358812800,4,1244,4.357758620689655

924608,4,6304785801,"Many years before 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' popularized making fun of bad films to a whole new generation, Woody Allen - in his first 'directing' gig - had a field day completely re-dubbing this unintentionally silly Japanese spy film into a very intentionally silly comedy about the desperate search for the recipe for the perfect egg salad.

It has a few dry spells, and I thought the spliced in musical numbers by 'The Lovin' Spoonful' were pretty embarrassing in a now dated attempt to make the film 'hip'.

But where it's funny, it's very, very funny.  And not only are there a slew of choice new lines, but the voice talents are all excellent, really capturing the awful, stiff voice acting we all got used to hearing in cheaply dubbed imports.

A one-of-a kind comedy, and worth checking out if you're in a silly mood, or are any sort of fan of Woody Allen's non-sequiters and wit.  Yes, it's adolescent compared with where Allen would go just a few years later, but that doesn't mean it's not a lot of fun!",1276646400,2,1019,4.607734806629834

This time around I got a few chuckles and an occasional guffaw, but not once did I really laugh. The original film is funnier than much of Woody's dialogue, in fact. The new lines are often just plain corny, cheesy, Catskills-in-the-60s stuff, a far cry from Allen's own far superior stand-up (check out his great Stand-Up cd from back then, it's far better than this film). And while there are some highlights, there are also some pretty lame, Gomer Pyle-level jokes that are among Woody's worst ever.

Sorry, but I wanted this to be even close to as funny as I remember it being. Instead I got an occasional payoff but was mostly just bored. It's a great idea but MST has done it far better since. Credit to Allen for starting the ball rolling here, but all told, once you get past the basic premise, most of the material just ain't that funny.

Woody's next few films, like The Front and Take The Money And Run, are funnier, and the ones after that like Sleeper and Love And Death, are much funnier still. If you're a huge fan, check this out.

924614,3,6304785801,"In 1966, Woody Allen was given his chance to direct his first film (which he wrote and starred in as well).  His job was to make a spy thriller and sure enough, he came up with something different.  The film studio purchased the rights to the Japanese films ""International Secret Police: A Barrel of Gunpowder"" and ""International Secret Police: Key of Keys"" (Kagi no Kag) and Allen pretty much had the scenes from both films rearranged and edited to create one film, strip all the sound and redub it to make a comedy.  The result is ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"".

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""what's up, tiger lily?"" is presented in the original aspect ratio of 2:35:1 and is enhanced for 16:9 TV's.  Picture quality for this 1966 film is actually pretty good on DVD.  I have read that many people prior to the DVD release, they watched really bad versions of the film and thus, Image Entertainment's release of the film was amazing.  The film contains a little grain and I didn't notice any major dust, scratches or film warping.

As for the audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital mono and is center channel driven.  But for those with a modern home theater receiver, may feel it best to have audio set at audio on all channels (esp. for those with 5.1 or 7.2 or higher setups).

There are no subtitles included in this DVD release.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

It is generally known that Woody Allen is not a big fan of special features for his films on DVD and wants the focus to be on the film.  But for ""what's up, tiger lily?"", you do get an audio selection for the dialogue used for the original theatrical version and an alternate version (which is literally a toned down dialogue).

For example, during a scene when Phil's date is kicked out of the car by Suki Yaki, in the original, his date screams ""Hey! You got my vibrator!"".  In the alternate version she screams, ""Hey! That's a rented car!""  So, you can select the original or alternate version for audio and you can listen to audio comparisons for certain scenes from the film selecting the original version or alternate version.

Also, included is a Woody Allen Filmography shown onscreen as text.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""what's up, tiger lily?"" is an interesting but yet a fun film.  To tell you the truth, the story of the film is unimportant because the way the story is written and how pacing for the film is set, but what does matter is how crazy the jokes are for the English dub and how hilarious and out of left field the  jokes can get and add a little perverted humor to the mix and see how it relates to the characters in the film.  So, the whole entire film is not meant to be taken seriously but is supposed to be one long joke and Woody Allen succeeds.

In fact, the way the film is edited, the pacing of the scenes seem out of place and in one instance, the film is paused and you see hand silhouette trying to rid a hair onscreen during the film while it is paused and is supposedly the film operator and his girlfriend having fun (I wonder if any moviegoers actually believed this and went to complain to the theater).  In fact, in one sequence, an interviewer who is confused by the story asks Woody Allen if he can summarize to the audience what has happened in the film thus far, Woody Allen answers ""no"".

I suppose if you are a Woody Allen fan, ""what's up, tiger lily?"" is a film that you want in your collection or for those curious of his first directorial debut.  It's a funny film that has a plot through its dub but what you see onscreen feels disjointed because the scenes have come from two different film sources.  But it was definitely an ambitious and experimental film for Woody Allen and I'm sure during that time, the film managed to succeed in making people laugh and to showcase sexy and beautiful Japanese women.

In fact, many of the talent in the film went on to bigger things.  Woody Allen and his wife at the time, Louise Sasser (who did the female dub voices) would go on to work on more films together.  As for the two main Japanese female characters, both Akiko Wakabayashi (who plays Suki Yaki) and Mie Hama (who plays Teri Yaki) became the two Japanese Bond girls in the 1967 film ""You Only Live Twice"".  Meanwhile, the stripping girl at the end of the credits, China Lee (who was Playboy Playmate of 1964) also appeared in several films.

While redubbing of Japanese films has become commonplace these days for some Japanese animation releases in the US (to make things much more appealing to American audiences) through the use of jokes and perverted humor (ie. ""Crayon Shin Chan"" from FUNimation Entertainment), ""what's up, tiger lilly?"" is definitely a funny film from 1966.  The humor still holds up nearly 45 years later and I was definitely entertained by it.

It's important to note that this DVD was released back in 2003 and was re-released in 2009.  There are no differences between the two.

Overall, ""what's up, tiger lily?"" Is not a groundbreaking film by any means, but if you are a Woody Allen fan and want to start out with his first film or have been curious about watching this film, then this film and the DVD is definitely worth checking out!",1261440000,14,5150,4.498924731182796
924702,4,6304785801,"What's up Tiger Lily: 7 out of 10: Long before Airplane or Mystery Science Theater 3000 or even my own mix-up of an uncut bootleg of Ch'jin densetsu Urotsukid'ji and Led Zeppelin II (Blows Pink Floyd and the Wizard of OZ out of the water.) there was What's Up Tiger Lily.

A very young Woody Allen acquired the rights of a Japanese James Bond knockoff called Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi (Literal English title International Secret Police: Key of Keys) and dubbed in his own dialogue.

The film starts with some non-dubbed footage involving bondage, a shootout, and a circular saw. Then Woody appears with an interviewer what he has done with the film. The film then restarts Woody's dubbing in place and with the exception of two short interruptions by Woody (both very funny) It is the Japanese import with a new script and story.

The dub itself is quite funny and well done. One can definitely see the roots of some of Woody Allen's comic themes in this work. The overall story of the world's greatest egg salad recipe is quite well done and the voice work is applicable and fits the onscreen characters well.

What's Up Tiger Lily benefits from good source material to work with. Longtime fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 know that even the best riffing can suffer from deadly boring source material. (Red Zone Cuba for example). What's Up Tiger Lily's source material is colorful, action packed, and has a very attractive cast. In fact I would love to see the original source material.

On the down side, since the film is dubbed, when the movie has no dialogue the experience can drag. Unlike an Airplane or a Mystery Science Theater 3000 riffing session, What's Up Tiger Lily isn't a 10 jokes a minute affair.

924813,5,6304785801,"`What's Up Tiger Lily' is a puzzle in Woody Allen's body of work. On the one hand, it is such a creampuff I expect it's primary value is as material for the question on daytime `Who Wants to be a Millionaire':

Which 1960's folk-rock band was featured as performers on Woody Allen's `What's Up Tiger Lily'?:

A. The Byrds

B. Buffalo Springfield

C. The Lovin Spoonful

D. The Mamas and the Papas

The answer, Meredith, is C. Final Answer.

An even more difficult question is who, exactly directed the movie, who wrote it, and who filmed it. Woody Allen's name is above the title on the front, yet he gets no credit as writer, although it is pretty obvious that he was the primary writer of the English dialogue you see on the screen. He also makes brief appearances in mock interviews where he is credited with the idea of the movie and with the dialogue.

There is virtually nothing in common in this film, released in 1966, with Allen's first full time actor / writer / director work, `Take the Money and Run', released in 1969 and produced by the usual Rollins and Joffre team. American International, the B-movie studio of Saul Arkoff whose stock in trade was cheap second-rate movies and imports, released this movie, of all things.

I must say that I rarely agree with blurbs on the front of DVD jackets, but I really think there is something to the statement `The film that began America's laugh affair with Woody Allen. Funny then, funnier now!'. Remarkably, aside from the very `60's act by the Lovin Spoonful, there is virtually nothing in the movie that dates it. Some of the parodies apply as effectively to the latest `Lethal Weapon' opus and, even more amazingly, to `Kill Bill' as it does to the cheap spy / martial arts Japanese movies of the 1960's.

The stated premise of the movie is that the American producers (Allen is credited as an Associate Producer) took the film of a cheap Japanese flick and put their own dialogue into the Japanese characters' mouths. The transplant works so well, I almost find it hard to believe this is what they really did. While I recognize some of the names of the dubbing actors (Louise Lasser, for example), I recognize nothing on the screen, and, no credit is given for the Japanese actors, writer, director, cinematographer, or gaffer. I guess this was all part of the deal with the Japanese producer that they got the raw film with no credits given.

I also happen to agree with the blurb from Leonard Maltin who says this is `...One long, very funny joke'. In a sense, for all the parodies done by both Allen and Mel Brooks, this is probably the one from Allen that is most similar to Mel Brooks' style, where the whole premise becomes part of the joke.

I must warn those to whom this is important that all the bad things you see about the filming of movies in the 1950's and 1960's is true of this flick. There is none of the great Gordon Willis cinematography, let alone any of Allen's high talent guest lensmen such as Sven Nykvist or Carlo De Palma.

Allen fans should not pass this up as they may with `Casino Royale' and `What's New Pussycat', where Allen is simply paying the rent by acting in these high cast comedies.",1114819200,4,3186,4.539267015706806

Seriously, this is for someone who wants to see a unique, creative, and truly funny movie. The idea is to dub a cheap James Bond knockoff movie made in Japan, with English dialogue written by Woody Allen. You'll have to see it to truly understand the hilarity of it all, but if you're still hung up on the fact that ""Fog and Mist and Darkness"" wasn't the correct title for your favorite movie, then, as I said before, skip it and go wine tasting.",1104278400,5,784,4.489510489510489
924905,3,6304785801,"""What's Up, Tiger Lily"" has nothing in common with what most people think of as 'Woody Allen films.' In other words, it isn't about an older intellectual having his heart broken in a seriocomic New York adventure with Dixieland jazz playing on the soundtrack. Instead, this movie is closer to what Mystery Science Theater might have been like with the Marx Brothers as hosts.

At this point you are either running from this review in disgust or want to learn more. To make this film, Woody took an early 1960s Japanese spy film, re-edited and redubbed it, and turned it into a pun-filled, absurd comedy about a stolen egg salad recipe. To further add to the chaos, the rock band The Loving Spoonful were tossed into the mix (without Woody's approval). The result is an exceptionally silly film, perhaps best viewed when slightly distracted. Woody stretches the single joke pretty far, and ironically his joke-filled dubbing has more accurate lip-synching than most imported Japanese films of the era that were given a 'straight' treatment.

Is this essential comedy? Not at all. Is it worth at least one viewing? Of course. There aren't any real extras on the disc (aside from a slightly less risque soundtrack), and while purist might have liked to see the original Japanese film on the same DVD, what purist could possibly find any of this funny?",1101686400,4,1348,4.856521739130435

""Tiger Lily"" is showing her age -- what was novel 30 years ago no longer is. We've seen better movie send-ups (""Airplane!"", MST3K). And Woody chose a film that doesn't have enough dialog to smother with jokes, so we're too-often stuck with watching a boring, derivative film.

924907,5,6304785801,"Whether or not you're a Woody Allen fan - and in my moviegoing experience it's a pretty divisive issue, you either love him or hate him - 'What's Up, Tiger Lily?' is a comic curveball of zingers, one-liners, puns, gags, and all-out innuendo all cleverly sneaking through the side door and turning an otherwise run-of-the-mill spy movie (back then, they were everywhere...EVERYBODY wanted to make the next James Bond) into a giddy treat.
The opening shot - featuring a scene from the film with its original audio track, followed by an introduction/confession by Woody Allen himself - doesn't really have a whole lot to do with the madness that ensues, except perhaps to provide a hilarious contrast.  The story goes as thus: Fresh from wrapping up one caper, self-proclaimed lovable rogue Phil Moskowitz is enlisted by the leader of a fictional country to retrieve its most priceless treasure - the recipe for the world's greatest egg salad - before it comes their turn to be put on the map.  With his two lovely lady-friends, Moskowitz becomes caught in a power struggle between Shepherd Wong, who has a thing for women's football and a passion for mayonnaise, and Wing-Fat, who carries a rather unique camera and whose henchmen officiate the wedding of a snake and a chicken.  Yep, that's pretty much the plot of the movie.
Any question of where the Spike Network came up with the idea for 'Most Extreme Elimination Challenge' seems answered to a tee with this flick, and again, you don't have to be a Woody Allen fan to enjoy this mindlessly-funny romp, particularly if you get a kick out of all those old dubbed Japanese monster movies. As a bonus, we get the Lovin' Spoonful making an appearance here and there in the flick, and even a few more comical cameos by Woody in the middle and at the end.
If you're an afficionado of the classic movie spoof - a genre that includes early Mel Brooks and Zucker/Abrahams works like 'Young Frankenstein' and 'Airplane!' - you'd get a kick out of 'What's Up, Tiger Lily?'.",1080518400,4,2015,4.751428571428572
924908,4,6304785801,"Ever watch a Japanese movie with really bad, dubbed English?  Well, in What's Up, Tiger Lily, Woody Allen went out and bought a Japanese spy movie, completely removed the audio track, and substituted his own, along with some minor editing of some scenes.  The result is a pretty funny movie about world-class espionage and egg salad.
The 'Allenized' (my own word, don't bother looking it up, as it's not in the dictionary) plot involves the theft of the world's greatest egg salad recipe, and the lengths some will go to recover it.  There are guns, beautiful woman, car chases, fights, more guns, action, and a marriage between a snake and a rooster.  I will admit some of the dubbed dialogue doesn't work so well, but there are a great number of truly funny scenes and hilarious lines.  During one of the fight scenes, Phil Moscowitz, the main character, yells out, 'Saracen pig! Spartan dog! Take this! And this! Roman cow! Russian snake! Spanish fly!' which had me rolling on the floor.  The laughs are not always forthcoming, but when they do come, they hit hard, in my opinion.  The scenes with the Cobra man were worth it alone for me to watch.
Woody is not really in the movie, except for inter cut scenes at the beginning, middle and very end.  I kind of wish he had done one of the voices in the dubbing, but you can sense his comedic style of writing throughout the movie.  Also included is a wonderful music score by The Lovin' Spoonful and they even make an appearance or two, with the help of some crafty editing.
As far as extras on the disc, you can choose to watch the movie with either the original, dubbed track or one created for television.  There is even a comprehensive section where you can go in and compared the two sometimes subtlety different tracks.  Also included is a fairly complete filmography of Woody Allen.  My only little, minor complaint was the text in the extra features sections was small and difficult to read.  As a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and Woody Allen, I did enjoy this movie. Although I think many people would just feel this was a silly, stupid movie with little value, I thought it was an interesting experiment, with quite a few laughs for those viewers with a skewed sense of humor and a little patience.

He took a Japanese ""B"" movie and eliminated the soundtrack.  This enabled him to dub in a completely new script which played on a lot of the scenes while creating an inane plot.  I saw it at the movie theater when it came out and I thought it was hillarious.  (As a young teenager, I also retained a somewhat vivid memory of the ending).  I was watching some more recent works of Woody Allen recently and the movie came back to mind.  I looked it up and ordered it through Amazon.com and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I wasn't tempted to rate it a ""5"" because there were some stretches between laughs.  However, in all fairness, Allen did have to put together some sort of a plot and follow the film he was spoofing.  If it was all gags, it wouldn't have worked as well as it did.  There were times I really cracked up laughing and I know I'll laugh again the next time I watch it.  Maybe this concept has been copied since ""What's up Tiger Lily?"" but I guess once was enough for Woody Allen.  This movie is one of the better ones from his early years as a writer/director.  I certainly am glad I picked up again after all these years.  I don't ever recall seeing it available on TV.",1075161600,2,1294,4.271604938271605
924910,3,6304785801,"I'm a big fan of Woody Allen, especially his earlier work.
This is, oddly enough, the film that got me into Woody Allen in the first place. It's rewritten dialog performed by Woody and some other actors, and it's totally hammed up. Some of the voices are great -- everybody has one line at some point that really just works perfectly with the absurd voice they've got.
Is it as intelligent as most Woody Allen films? Absolutely not -- it's just ridiculous dialog about the search for the ultimate egg salad recipe. It's long on throwaway lines and just ridiculous, almost Mystery Science Theater 3000 comments, and short on the usual jokes about death, dying, or Bergman.
However, it'd be totally inappropriate to have all of that stuff in this movie. Let's face it, this movie is just a silly, unpretentious exercise. The problem is that while it's usually funny -- laugh out loud funny at times -- it's uneven. Sometimes it can fly by, but frequently, it feels like it bogs down for a while, and the jokes wear thin.
This is a great movie if you like Mystery Science Theater 3000 type treatments, but if you can't stand them, I would avoid this at all costs. If you're a Woody Allen fan, chances are you'll like it, but it's a movie that definitely merits a rental first. I have a number of friends who are Woody fans that don't like this movie one bit. Likewise, I know a number of people who like this movie that can't stand Annie Hall (which makes me wonder what's wrong with them).
If you like absurd comedy with strange dialog, this is definitely up your alley.
Also, extra cool: The makers included the original and alternate dialog tracks (there are two Woody Allen dialog tracks, subtly different -- not a Japanese and English version) -- so you can pick what version you like. There's also a comparison that calls out the major differences in the special features, plus the egg salad recipe is hidden on the disc.",1071014400,3,1924,4.579710144927536
924911,2,6304785801,"The 60's were definitely a time for experimentation, and breaking barriers, so perhaps this concept made sense then.  Take a Japanese action movie, remove the soundtrack and dialog, have Woody Allen write an entirely different script to convert it to a comedy, and then dub the dialog in English, with new music and added scenes, and the result is What's Up Tiger Lily?
The supposed plot of this disjointed farce, follows secret agent Phil Moscowitz in his quest to recover a secret formula for egg salad.  Coming up with ""suitable"" comedic dialog to ""match"" the action on-screen, is a reactionary process.  Writing in this manner, occasionally produces humorous dialog that works with some of the scenes.  However, creating any kind of cohesive storyline out of these individual jokes and gags, is a task the writing can't accomplish.
Applying references from American and Jewish culture, to a Japanese film, is one of the sources for the humor, but many times the writing strives too hard to be funny, going overboard for cheap laughs, with an endless stream of one liners.  A limited number of voices are used for the dubbing, and the vocal delivery style is reminiscent of a Shaw Brothers production.  Both of which, get monotonous after a while.
The film's credits list ""A no star cast"".  Featured are actresses Mie Hama (Teri Yaki), and Akiko Wakabayashi (Suki Yaki), who both would appear the following year in the James Bond film, You Only Live Twice (1967).  Actor Tatsuya Mihashi, who plays Moscowitz, may be also be known for playing a Japanese Army officer, in Frank Sinatra's war film None But the Brave.
The music of the Lovin' Spoonful is featured in the film, and the group appears playing a couple of songs.  It is interesting, that Woody Allen was apparently so displeased that released version of the film included the group, that he threatened legal action.

Therefore, this is not really an apt comparison.  However, I never miss a chance to kvetch about the appalling dearth of good films that remain unreleased in the U.S.
The chat rooms being, as near as I can determine, useless I would like to engage in discussions with some people who also list films that should be on DVD.  Maybe we could instigate letter writing campaigns.  I was amazed at how many lists included A Fine Madness and The Offence.  Anyone interested may feel free to email me.  eMail address in on my Amazon page.",1060992000,2,923,4.660493827160494
924965,3,6304785801,"A Film by Woody Allen
I've seen several Woody Allen films, but I can't say that I'm a big fan.  What interested me most was the concept of this movie: Woody Allen takes a Japanese ""B"" spy film, removes the language track, dubs his own and changes the entire movie into a comedy.  It was a daring idea then, and it remains a daring idea today.  It is similar to Mystery Science Theater, only instead of having a group of people outside the film mocking it; the characters do the job themselves.
Whatever the original source material was about, What's Up, Tiger Lily? is a comedic quest to retrieve a stole recipe for Egg Salad.  That's right...egg salad.  There are several funny moments throughout the movie (the best is when Woody introduces the film and claims that ""Gone With the Wind"" was actually a redubbed Japanese film), but as a whole I felt let down.  The concept was fantastic, and I know that the action and the dialogue were intentionally absurd, but the movie didn't work for me.  I appreciate how well the dubbed dialogue fits into the movie, so well that I considered the fact that Woody might actually have shot the movie using Japanese actors in order to better fit the dialogue and action.  The dub fits the movie that well.  While it is occasionally funny and interesting, it wasn't interesting enough for me to give the movie a positive review.  I just didn't care for the movie.",1060128000,2,1400,4.564
924966,2,6304785801,"Take a B-grade, Japanese spy film, write an entirely new script, and dub new tracks with English-speaking actors.  What do you get?  A B-grade Japanese spy film dubbed into English.  Woody Allen's re-wrttien script did not do anything to enhance the movie.  Granted, there are a few good one-liners, plus the first score of a film written entirely by a rock band, The Lovin' Spoonful, but the humor is lacking.  Maybe when the film was first released, the search for the world's best egg salad recipe (""it will make you PLOTZ!) was considered funny.  Now, it just seems outdated and very safe.
I actually enjoyed when Woody Allen cut in with his interview regarding the movie itself.  That's where Allen's sense of humor really shines.  But still, I found it difficult to laugh during this film and had to force myself to watch it all the way through, just to be fair.  Woody Allen has better films out there!
The DVD has some okay extras and, if you look hard enough, you can find the egg salad recipe hidden in the main menu.",1059782400,4,1027,4.5683060109289615
924967,5,6304785801,"I ran across this movie many years ago as a Late, Late Movie on broadcast TV and have watched it every chance I can get.  The movie is hilarious.
But did you also know that it was also the first movie scored by a rock band?  The Lovin' Spoonful (who arguably would've been even bigger had it not been for the Beatles) wrote all the incidental music tracks for the movie.  Other movies had rock soundtracks, but What's Up Tiger Lily was the first to have original background music written and played by a rock band. The brief music interludes that were interjected into the movie were a psychedelic bow to The Lovin' Spoonful who were VERY popular in 1966.

924969,5,6304785801,"Thus utters ""Wing Fat"", Japanese gangster and Wayne Newton lookalike, in Woody Allen's ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"" in reference to a much-coveted secret egg salad recipe.
""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"" has, in my opinion, always been looked upon as Mr. Allen's filmic poor relation. To the yuppified, nouvelle cuisine-eating self-appointed Allen ""aficionados"", ""Tiger Lily"" is a cinematic Nathan's hot dog. What a shame, because it is a very funny, unpretentious, inspired piece of nonsense.  Mr. Allen took a 1960s Japanese James Bond [pretend] film, wiped out the dialogue track and, with the help of some very talented performers (including his then-wife Louise ""Mary Hartman"" Lasser), dubbed in some of the funniest dialogue ever heard on screen. I can't even guess what the plot of the original film was (it's actually pretty [darn] funny without the dialogue), but after Mr. Allen finished with it, the drama centers around the coveted egg salad recipe. The recipe has been stolen from Raspur, a ""nonexistent yet real-sounding country"", and rival bad guys Shepperd Wong and Wing Fat both want it for their own sinister purposes. Hero Phil Moscowitz (played by Matt Helm [pretend] Tatsuo Mihashi) plays double agent in this mishigas (in between his womanizing shenanigans, unsuccesfully trying to seduce Japanese dolls Miss Teri Yaki and her sister Suki). One must wonder which filmmaker copied who, because actresses Mie Hama and Akiko Wakabayashi, who played the Yaki sisters, both went on to star opposite Sean Connery in the James Bond opus ""You Only Live Twice"" a few years later! I won't go any further into the plot line of this film, thin as it is, nor will I spoil the fun by quoting the dialogue, but I will simply say that the film is very, very funny and not for the slow-witted. The dialogue is a rapid-fire combination of Borscht Belt humor, and also prefigures the hilarious, brainy quips uttered by the 2 robots on ""Mystery Science Theater"". There's the obligatory cartoon violence (kick, punch, chop, shoot) and a somewhat superfluous musical score by John Sebastian and The Lovin' Spoonful, and footage of the 1960s rock group is interspersed throughout the film. Undoubtedly this was added to the film to attract the ""young, hip"" audience. At least the clothes, hairdos and dance steps of the ""young folk"" are worth a few laughs! And, of course, there are brief filmed interviews with Woody Allen himself, deadpanning and double-talking his way through all of this, making it even funnier, and a striptease by voluptuous China Lee, a former Playboy Playmate, providing even more Asian eye candy for the horndog viewers. ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"" is a very enjoyable 89 minutes, but be warned-an hour later, you'll be hungry for more laughs again!",1022025600,46,2760,5.052631578947368
924970,4,6304785801,"A woman steps into the room wearing a towel.  She and her lover gaze longingly at each other.  ""Name three presidents!"" she says.  In the wake of his early success, Allen purchased the rights to an extra-cheesy Japanese spy thriller, threw out the entire soundtrack, then wrote and dubbed in a new script.  Mix in a ""what has this got to do with anything?"" soundtrack by the folk-rock 60s group The Lovin' Spoonful and a few new scenes, and the result is Allen's infamous WHAT'S UP, TIGER LILY?  And it is one of the most bizarre movies you're likely to see this lifetime, a film which has attained cult-movie status of the highest order.
The movie is uneven--but that is actually part of its charm.  Where else can you see big-haired 60s mamas get down like psycho killers to the innocuous music of The Lovin' Spoonful?  Or tacky special effects, inept hop-and-chop fighting, and ridiculously bad cinematography reworked into the story of a bunch of spies on the track of a recipe for the world's best egg salad?  And some of the lines are a hoot and a half.  My own favorite: ""Bring plenty of dynamite.  It's a big mother!"" Hardcore Allen fans, who often approach him as if he were God, will probably be embarrassed by this movie.  Allen himself is pretty embarrassed: he's been trying to live it down for years.  But if you have a taste for the bizarre--not to mention some good, I mean REALLY good egg salad--TIGER LILY is the movie for you.

The other  good thing are the approx. two minutes in which Woody Allens appears, and  the gorgeous 1960's-style Japanese girls.
There's no story; a few very  funny (or rather: far out) laughs, mostly because of the extremely poor,  nearly parodistic quality of the Japanese movie; and that's about it.
