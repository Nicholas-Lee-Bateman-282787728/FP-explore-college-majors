7331879,1,B011AO9HJO,"I would give this half a star if not for the fact that this ""movie"" (seemingly made with a budget of a couple hundred dollars) makes all my troubles in life seem so petty. Shot in gray, cold , dreary Montreal(?) it hammers home the point ""so you think YOU have it bad?"" It's all about perspective and the desperate druggies in this film exhausted me but at the same time lifted me up. A few sex scenes were a tad redeeming, but this is a movie that if you don't terminate by halfway thru, you'll no doubt go skimming in fast forward for the second loooong hour.",1443139200,4,561,4.203703703703703
7331880,1,B011AO9HJO,Rather awful. No plot. Self-indulget cinema of the worst kind.  You should offer a refund.  It was bloody torture.  JH,1442448000,2,118,4.8

8723990,1,B011AO9HJO,"What a terrible movie! There isn't even dialog. There are short phases like ""get in the car!"", ""I want three rocks"", ""Bruno?"". If you want to see a bunch of people walking, then running, then sitting and thinking, then this is right up your alley. Dreary, drab, and pointless.",1469145600,,276,4.653061224489796

8723995,4,B011AO9HJO,"Alex is a drug addict who sells his body for the cash to carry on his addiction. His life seems to centre around giving or having pleasure but the periods in between are anything but enchanting. He has a coterie of friends or probably associates who are all equally caught in a seemingly never ending spiral of self destruction. Like holding the tigers tail  they are destined to never get off.

The film follows their lives and the highs (very few) and the lows (too many) of how they eek out a survival in a Canadian winter. It is hard hitting and graphic with scenes of drug taking and preparation peppered throughout. There is also simulated sex and it is not the stuff that could be classed as tasteful.

This is not an easy watch either and I felt that some of the scenes could have ended sooner, but this was probably an artistic choice by the director to emphasise the emptiness of what the protagonists are actually doing. This is a gay themed film too in that Alex is gay but it is quite universal in the themes it addresses. At 120 minutes and in French this is one for the not so squeamish and for those who like their films to be challenging.",1455494400,2,1155,4.362790697674418
8723996,4,B011AO9HJO,"Wow! The full in depth detail of what happens to people who are under the influence of drugs, is poignant in this film. I know a guy, who's just like this. Would do, say anything, just go chase that high, that can never be obtained! Down to the sex. An outer body experience to really see in real time, let alone my film. Shame. Deep! Great movie.",1450742400,4,347,4.1940298507462686

8723998,4,B011AO9HJO,"It is as it should be. Some here would have you believe it's really terrible, when in fact it's terribly real. It reminded me of ""Our Lady of Assassins,"" and its unjudgmental look at people who are relentlessly fatalistic, who live only in the moment, and follow their impulses shamelessly. It's not for everyone, but to say it appears low budget or colorless is a lie. So much skin can't be colorless: at times it's disturbingly intimate, discomfiting, rank. It's tedious at times, but that's the most heartbreaking aspect of it. If you can't sustain empathy for a couple of hours while observing such vulnerability, then the issue isn't with the film. All involved should be proud of this work, particularly the actors for allowing such soulful exposure.",1444694400,13,756,4.9140625
