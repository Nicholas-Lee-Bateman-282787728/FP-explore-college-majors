8067266,5,B0009VBT7I,"My son loved the DVD. I like this a bit more than Baby Einstein Numbers Nursery because its more educational. For eg, the numbers shown are upto 10. They show other addition, subtraction and equality facts. My son liked it a lot, because the numbers were shown with animals. He liked the song with the ducks and keeps singing it. I think the new collection of Galloping Minds DVDs - the Baby Learns Series is pretty awesome.",1128384000,4,424,4.51948051948052
