It gives a pretty good overview of Sarah and her obsession of building this massive mansion starting in 1884 when she inherited $20 MILLION from her late husband, the founder of the Winchester Repeating Rifle. Sarah believed that if she didn't continually build this house as long as she lived that the ghosts of the victims that were killed would come back and haunt her. So, taking the advice of a spiritualist telling her to build, she did so nonstop until the day she died in September, 1922.

 In reality though, to this day the place is still undergoing renovation and upkeep for the enjoyment of all who visit. The program also goes into detail about the many glass windows and the number 13, featured prominently throughout the mansion. Sarah's Mansion has one of the best collections of antique glass windows in the Country.
 I visited this Mansion in June, 2015. It is a lovely place and I encourage all to visit to get a first hand view of this strange, but magnificent place in San Jose, CA.
I would say I found this video to show more of the inside of it then others that have this Mansion featured, although the entire Mansion is not shown inside, it's halls and rooms that are open are pretty much shown. I was happy with it.
DVD is clean, colorful, informative and enjoyable to watch.
The video runs 20 minutes and I wish it was longer, but the narration is good and shot very well.
Color, fullscreen, as it was shot by and for the Winchester Mansion.
There is no menu, it starts playing right when you put it in the DVD or Blu-ray player.
I paid a little less than what this site is asking, but well worth it if you are fascinated by this mansion, like me.",1436140800,6,1686,4.467532467532467
