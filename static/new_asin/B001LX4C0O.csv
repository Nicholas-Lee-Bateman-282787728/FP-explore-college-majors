8319996,4,B001LX4C0O,The DVD isn't meant to replace Bible study or teach the Bible but more so to give young children a means to understand the message in the stories,1506384000,,145,4.214285714285714
8319997,5,B001LX4C0O,Good Stories for teaching kids. My kids love these movies and they learn from the stories. Helps them to visualize the Bible. I highly recommend this series is the most accurate I have found and is neutral on Christian religions.,1483747200,,229,4.75
8319998,1,B001LX4C0O,Jehovah Witness material.  Not appropriate for my needs.,1470268800,,56,6.0
8319999,5,B001LX4C0O,"I bought the entire collection of both the Old Testament Bible Stories for Children, and the New Testament series as well. Although the Japanese-based animation is the same in both series, the flow of the storytelling and the music soundtrack is much better in the Old Testament series (although I must admit that on some of the DVDs, the story could have been shortened by 5 minutes or so). Both series are geared towards children, and it is the reason why the violence and attempted rape scenes were removed but still referred to, so that the view understands the context of the story. This is a great series for children to watch and learn about the Old Testament. It is a useful teaching tool for parents, especially if each DVD is purchased for $5 or less.",1437264000,,761,4.602941176470588
8320000,5,B001LX4C0O,I loved this cartoon especially watching it as an adult. I like the fact that even a child can understand the meaning. The concept is simple but entertaining!,1384992000,,158,4.678571428571429
8320001,4,B001LX4C0O,"I love this product nicely presented for kids. My kids and I enjoy watching it, over and over this a great satisfaction for the mind",1367452800,,132,4.32
8320002,2,B001LX4C0O,"I hate to give bad reviews to products based on the Bible but this was really bad.  This story is NOT consistent with what happened in the Bible.  The inconsistencies are actually very important to the understanding of how God deals with us and what He expects from us so I'm not just harping on the insignificant facts of the stories or those that are open to ""interpretation"".  It is important that we give children an ACCURATE representation of how God deals with them.

*  Some of what transpires in this DVD is just wrong.  For example, in the DVD Sauls dealings with the witch of Endor do not agree with the facts as explained in the Bible.  In the version on the DVD Saul tells the witch that if she doesn't tell him that he'll kill her.  Read the story for yourself in 1 Samuel 28:6-20.  That's not in the Bible.
*  The voice quality/acting on this DVD is bad.  Here is an Example ""You know why all men fear you because all men fear you because you always tell them what Jehovah wants you to tell them.""  That's a typical sentence from this dvd.  If you can't see the problem with this, maybe the DVD will entertain you.  For those who want to teach your children to speak properly, I suggest avoiding this DVD.  Will kids notice this stuff? Maybe not.  But it doesn't make it ""right""
*  Another example (minor but a problem for me since this could have been fixed through editing the sound) Saul pronounces the Amalekites the ""Amekalites"" in some instances and ""Amalekites"" in others.
*  There is constant mention of ""Jehovah"" and ""Yaweh"" instead of ""God"" which could be problem depending on the age of your children.
*  The animation is good where these types of DVD's are concerned.  It is actually one of the best animation quality I've seen for Bible DVD's.  I would suggest that this is appropriate children that can handle a half-naked David as he mourned the death of his son from his affair with Bathsheba.

Why do those who make Bible Animations for Children insist on modifying the stories to include erroneous and false materials?  Sigh...

You have been warned.",1258416000,26,2082,4.53494623655914
