2334083,5,B0009X77I6,This is an amazing work up the tall box portion is the best the standing lo impact aerobics was not to challenging for me but then I just add weights . With the Firm when u R no longer swearing for box aerobics increase the incline .. Add weights .. Add heavier weights u will continue to get a good work out .. I don't have the transfirmer .. So for tall box I used my fanny lifter and I just didn't travel .. For incline I used a differnt incline box .. So pause u need more time like 30 seconds to make the changes .. Worse case use a regular stepper and increase the height to 8 you will still get s good work out..,1432425600,,619,3.8818897637795278

2334086,4,B0009X77I6,"With a running time of 54 minutes, this workout leaves no body part untouched.  Alternating between floor aerobics, step aerobics, high step, and incline step, you get a lot of variations without stressing out your brain.
This is a tough workout, which requires lots of use of your heavy weights, and a bunch of high-step leg work that really gets to your thighs and backside.
Equipment needed; An incline step (which is used in the incline position for maybe 10-15 minutes of the entire workout), 3 sets of weights, and a mat.",1424995200,,527,4.728260869565218

2334094,3,B0009X77I6,"This tape does both aerobic and body shaping/sculpting with light weights. It moves quickly, like four repetitions, then on to the next movement, so it will take a long while to learn the various motions in the tape if you are to keep up. Another approach is to do it at your own reduced speed and skip some movements.",1382745600,,318,4.406779661016949

2334096,5,B0009X77I6,"I don't understand the reviews on here that say this workout isn't challenging and complain about it not getting your heart rate up. First of all it's the Firm's style/technique to mix in cardio segments with lifting segments and that's generally disclosed in their DVD descriptions. Second this workout has three types of segments: some straight cardio, some just lifting/strengthening and some cardio w/lifting. If you aren't using the weights during the cardio w/lifting segments add some, trust me your heart rate will go up, if you are using weights than maybe they're too light. All I know is that when I'm repeatedly stepping up onto a 14"" step, extending my free leg behind me and my arms out in front of me holding 5lb weights then yeah my heart is going good. There's also a cardio section that is mostly hopping, jumping and kicking it's not long, but it's long enough and gets me sweating. I was in great shape after working out with the Firm Cardio Sculpt and jogging for a year straight, some weeks I was even walking upwards of 20 miles plus and doing the Cardio Sculpt, after a year of that I moved onto this video and it kicked my butt. I also noticed that in about two weeks my legs were getting even shapelier (my husband noticed too). The only way I think that this workout would be considered easy is if you were used to doing something like the Insanity Workout or maybe Crossfit. In any regard I love this workout. Like I said after a year of doing Cardio Sculpt I needed to switch it up. This workout is fun, more challenging than Cardio Sculpt, but like CS let's you work your way up by adding or increasing weights. The bunny hop and aforementioned step up w/leg and arm extensions are my favorites. This gives you a decent arm workout which I appreciate, it's so hard to find cardio workouts that do both arms and legs (usually just legs). I also like the step around segment, the music is good, there's one part that's funny and you can even see Ali giggle a bit. I def. recommend this, Cardio Sculpt and Supercharged Sculpting.",1377648000,,2056,4.544474393530997
2334097,2,B0009X77I6,The video requires you to be coordinated and somewhat of a dancer.  The moves are hard to pick up unless your a natural dancer or cheerleader.  You will need their specific step to do the workout or you won't be able to do half of it.  I recommend Jari Love DVDs if you want a step workout that will burn a lot of calories.  Her DVDs don't require you to be a dancer.,1374364800,,367,3.9863013698630136
2334098,4,B0009X77I6,"I am a long-time FIRMer and own many of their workout DVDs.  Allie, who leads this one, has been a favorite of mine for years.  With that said, while she looks AMAZING in this video, she lacks some of the enthusiasm she normally has.  It's almost like she's ""phoning it in.""  That's a little disappointing for me because she's usually more motivating.  That's not to say she doesn't say motivating things in this one, but somehow it seems less genuine.  Maybe she was having an off day.  I won't hold it against her, though.  Overall, this is a really good workout.  I workout to FIRM videos 5 or 6 days a week and I feel this one 2 days later.  Since I rotate videos and equipment, I guess this one hit muscles I hadn't hit in a while.  (Note:  I LOVE when I feel like I've worked out, so this is a definite plus.)  The toning work is great in this one.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I really didn't like the cardio portions.  They were boring and not as good as FIRM cardio usually is. The cardio parts didn't really bring my heart rate up either.  Overall, I like this one and I will keep it in my rotation.  I just might also throw in a different, quick cardio workout in too.",1373500800,,1198,4.184210526315789
2334099,4,B0009X77I6,"I enjoy this CD, but Im a beginner and I'm having a little trouble catching up or learning the steps. I will get it soon, but there should be a section for learning the steps first for beginners",1372377600,,194,4.131578947368421
2334100,5,B0009X77I6,I love the firm series and this is no exception.  I just don't the fact they their step bench is quietly promoted and a regular one as the one I have does not work as well with the exercises,1371168000,,190,3.871794871794872
2334101,4,B0009X77I6,"I do not have the equipment that they have so I find myself making modifications so I can use my step. If I can not do it I just use my step up and down. I still find it hard to get through it, but I really like it. The ladies make is easy to follow up the work out",1368144000,,265,3.433333333333333
2334102,5,B0009X77I6,"I REALLY love this workout! For some reason I just feel complete after doing this one! The workout seems very balanced. The cardio is easy, but if you use the blue section for all of the step cardio parts, you will get a more advanced workout. I never owned the actual ""Transfirmer"", but I DO own the purple/blue one and the old ""wooden"" 14 inch step from the Classics. ;)

You can do this without the Transfirmer. I don't use incline anyways since doing lunges and dips, etc...on an incline actually hurts my knees MORE (not sure why). I also think you get a bit more of a harder workout if you do lunges and dips straight on the floor (because you are lifting higher). ;)

I think out of ALL of the BSS workouts, this one comes close to the more ""classic feel"" of the FIRM. Her cuing is good, the music flows, and the reps are just enough to work you out without being too hard or too long. You can modify heavier weights a bit easier with this one as well. I do like the abs in this one too!

A solid A! And I use this one ALL the time still!",1347408000,,1045,4.087804878048781
2334103,1,B0009X77I6,"I use to work out a few times a week when i was younger and I had a vhs step type video years ago, it was a 1/2 hour of cardio work, then some toning, and i was looking for a similiar one on dvd. I am 50 and have not worked out in a few years, so you would you would think i would not be able to complete this dvd on the first go around. I did not even break a sweat with this dvd! The cardio workout and the toning workout are chopped together, so you don't get your heart rate up, She doesnt do cardio for more than 10 minutes at a time, then she is sitting on the bench. You couldn't do just the cardio part or just the toning, because they are all mixed up together. My heart rate barely elevated, and when it did, it was probably because i was so mad at what a waste this dvd was. SHe would talk about these difficult moves when toning and i thought she was nuts, there was nothing difficult in this dvd. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

2334107,2,B0009X77I6,"To sum it up, ""Aerobic Body Shaping"" is not as good as the older firm videos (Such as the Cross-trainer series and Total body shaping mix)

The cardio segments are too slow, repetitive, boring, and stiff. I couldn't get my heart rate up. The lifting segments were OK, except for some of the lunges that were awkwardly executed on the incline step. The movements were so odd that I couldn't concentrate on any particular area of the lower body.

At last, the abdominal segment was terrible.

The instructor suggests that you straighten and extend your legs out to do the crunches. You end up just working your hip flexors and compressing your lower spine.

I suggest you bend your knees to 90 degrees and push your belly button towards the floor, than proceed with the crunches.",1304035200,,777,4.6911764705882355

2334111,3,B0009X77I6,"This is a quick, mostly strength workout. Not a lot of cardio - my heartrate is around 40-50% of maximum during most of the workout. Plus, it's pretty short. The routines are pretty basic, and get boring quickly. I find most of The Firm routines pale in comparison to CIA workout videos.",1234742400,,287,4.538461538461538
2334112,5,B0009X77I6,"This is a really great workout. It works all of your muscles and will definitely make you sweat. The transfirmer is especially great for targeting hips, butt, and thighs. I really feel the burn in these areas when using the transfirmer. If you feel your not getting enough of a workout, add more weight and you will feel the burn and start to sweat. If it is too difficult, there are modifications you can make which are more for beginners. I love this series, I love Allie and most of The Firm videos are great wrokouts and easy to follow. The only thing that can be a problem is the cueing - the master instructors tend to get left/right confusion because they want you to mirror their moves, but it doesn't throw me off really.",1233705600,,730,4.4148148148148145
2334113,5,B0009X77I6,"I started using Firm DVDs just about a month ago. The first time it was little hard to follow, but compared to other Firm instructors she is really good and by 2nd time, I knew the moves. Good DVD, worth the $$!",1203984000,,211,4.0476190476190474
2334114,5,B0009X77I6,"This is one of my favorite Firm workouts. I use only the Firm for strength training and tend to keep the workouts that combine enough cardio & total-body sculpting. The reason I keep coming back to this one is because it's so much fun. There are some new cardio moves which are real boredom-busters for me as well as solid weight lifting. This is one workout I actually look forward to doing.
One word about the equipment-My Firm rotation spans Classic Vol. 1 through the Fitprimes/KickButts to the Transfirmer series. I've kept my Transfirmer and gotten rid of all the other Fanny Lifters. If you have this, it's all you need. Simply turn it verically for the older tapes. I actually like having the larger surface for leg presses-it feels more stable. I've never had the scultping stick-to me 8 lbs. never seemed worth the bother. With those workouts I hold 5 lb. dumbells in each hand & simulate the moves. Works for me. I have a 4 lb. bar for an adjustable dumbell set that I hold for the ab work using the sculpting stick, or again use hand weights. I know some people are put off by the amount of equipment used, but you really can get by without purchasing everything.
Happy Firming!",1183075200,,1190,4.53953488372093
2334115,4,B0009X77I6,"I have been using FIRM videos for about three years; it is the only program that I have used consistently, and I have had nothing but success with it.

Allie is one of my favorite instructors because she has an upbeat personality, comes off as genuine, and is a supportive coach (seems like she always knows just when to say, ""I know this is getting tough but you can do it!"").  I won't go through an entire run-down of all of the exercises (see Teedums' review for an excellent and thorough review), but this is a great cardio+sculpt video.  I find the footwork on the cardio to be relatively easy (I got it down on the second run), and the sculpting is nice and completely exhausts each muscle group (but make sure you are using weights that are heavy enough for your fitness level).

I gave it four stars instead of five for two reasons:  personal preference (I'll take cardio-only videos over anything!) and I thought that the footwork on the cardio was a little boring (sorry, Allie!  I usually love your routines!).  The music during the final stretch is good; I have had the song in my head for days--- I just love it!",1176249600,,1125,4.458536585365854
2334116,5,B0009X77I6,"This is basically an ""interval"" workout, alternating strength-training segments with cardio segments to keep your heart rate up throughout the entire session.  Intervals are a great way to burn maximum fat while building muscle (which not only looks great but helps increase your metabolism in the long run)!

The strength-training segments are very well-rounded, hitting all the major muscle groups and sequenced perfectly between upper and lower body which a) keeps you from completely burning out on one muscle group before you're finished toning it from all angles and b) keeps the blood moving quickly back and forth between the upper to lower extremeties to maximize your fat-burning potential.

Some reviewers just don't seem to be fans of the instructor, but I like the fact that she seems to understand exercise science very well and communicates some of the ""whys"" (i.e. ""Use your heaviest weights for this movement because you're utilizing a large muscle group"") instead of the usual ""Get ready for bikini season!"" fluff in a lot of workout videos.

I also want to give props to the Transfirmer step system itself, what a great way to work your body in new and interesting ways when you can't go to the gym!  I'll be using this a LOT!",1145836800,,1245,4.937799043062201
2334117,5,B0009X77I6,"This workout is part of the Firm's new Transfirmer series.  The Transfirmer is a 2 part contraption similar to the Fanny Lifter but longer in length and a lot more versatile.  The 6 and 8 inch platforms can be used individually, stacked together for a 14 inch platform for the Firm's famous leg presses and tall box climbs, incline position for added intensity for step routines and strength work, or in a side by side position which resembles a staircase.  It is a great piece of equipment very sturdy and stable, definitely an improvement over the Firm Box.  This workout calls for the Transfirmer but if you don't have one you can use a normal step and a stool.  You will also need 3 sets of dumbells, light, medium and heavy.

On to the workout, Allie Del Rio leads you through 55 minutes of strength training and aerobics.  She is joined by 4 fellow Firm Master instructors including Alison who shows beginner modifications.  You begin with a simple warmup, using the 6 inch portion of the Transfirmer, though you begin on the floor for a few minutes before moving to the TF.

The first strength segment starts with heavy 4 limb work using medium weights, hover squats then adding hammer curls into overhead presses, like a clean and press in hammer position.  Then you will grab some heavy weights and do more squats and overhead presses, this time with palms facing outward.  Then you will move into leg presses on the right leg, reverse hammer curls for biceps, and finish out with leg presses on the left leg.

Time for the first cardio segment, a fun step routine performed on the incline which includes press steps with an option to add triple steps, turn steps, knee lifts, L-steps, and knee and hamstring repeaters.  Later in the segment the repeaters are performed on the 8 inch portion to add a little extra intensity but you could always just do them on the 6 inch part if you want to.

Back to strength work, more leg presses, this time you will start by doing them off the back then you will step down off to the side targeting the inner thighs a little more.  Then you will move into one arm lat rows on the right arm, then you will do some tall box climbs while using light weights (3 lbs).  Starting with the right foot you will step up and tap with the other foot, later adding glute lifts and then frontal shoulder raises.  Of course you have the option to skip the weights here if you are not ready for them.  Next are pushups done on the step, I prefer to just do them on the floor myself.  Then it's back to tall box climbs on the left leg, then one arm lat rows

with the left arm, then you will finish out this segment with leg presses on the left leg.

More incline step aerobics, this segment is actually performed more on the floor than on the step though.  You will straddle around the step, sort of like a V-step, then you will add taps on the step then reverse straddles on the step which is the only part that you are actually on the step.  I liked this segment a lot.

For the next strength segment you will leave the TF in it's incline position.  Starting with side lunges on the left leg, then you will face the TF and do double arm lat rows, then you will do forward lunges onto the incline, which to me is much safer than doing forward lunges on the floor.  Next you will lie down on the incline and do some upper body work, pec flies then ribcage pullovers.  Then you will stand back up and do a set up dips (reverse lunges), the TF is not used for this at all.

Time for low impact aerobics, Allie shows you the ""Box Step"" which is a little tricky and might take a few tries to get it down, I am still trying to master it myself.  You will also do some low jacks, repeaters (later adding hi-med-lo), with the option to do a small hop or a calf raise to keep it low impact.  This segment was a lot of fun, despite the fact that I stumble a bit while attempting those box steps.

Time for more strength work on the incline, you will repeat the side lunges on the opposite leg, then you will do french presses for the triceps, face the incline for more forward lunges, then you will lie down on the incline again for more chest work.  This time you will do bench presses later adding rotation to target the triceps some more.  Then you will do lying tricep extensions, Allie just uses one dumbell here, holding it at it's ends.  I personally use 2 dumbells as it is more comfortable for me.  Then you will stand back up and do reverse lunges (dips) which completes the standing lower body work.

One more aerobic segment which is low impact.  This segment includes bunny hops with turns, then marching up and back with power options later added, step kick/tap rears, then some mambo cha chas with triple steps.  Another fun cardio segment.

Final strength segment, here you will do bicep curls, tricep dips and rear deltoid raises.  Then you will move on the floor and do some lower body work unweighted.  You will prop your heels up on the TF and do some bridge work with inner thigh squeezes and some hip rocks from side to side.  Then you will scoot away from the TF and do some ab work.  Starting with traditional crunches, oblique twist with added knee crunches, alternating oblique twists, traditional crunches with legs extended straight out while adding knee crunches.  After this you will do a brief set of planks then it's time to cooldown and stretch.

This is my favorite in the BSS4 series, you target all the muscle groups and you get some cardio too.  The workout is fun and it seems to fly by.  Allie does a nice job leading here as always.  I would consider myself to be high intermediate to low advanced, and felt this workout was intermediate level but suitable for all fitness levels.

In additional there is a short bonus 10 minute lower body section which is led by Allie by herself.  It is floor work done while lying on the Transfirmer, I personally just do it on the floor.  Here you will see more bridge work, table work and outer/inner thigh work.  It is a nice little add on or it can be done on it's own.

I would recommend this one to anyone who enjoys the Firm workouts, it's become one of my all time favorite Firms.",1145318400,,6187,4.37215411558669
2334118,4,B0009X77I6,"As an advanced Firmer, I have to say that I was slightly disappointed with this tape, along with one other tape in the new Transfirmer series. For those unfamiliar, the Transfirmer series is comprised of the new Transfirmer box and the DVD's or videos that come along with it. I found that I didn't begin to sweat as quickly as with the other workouts in my extensive Firm collection. I felt I was doing the same moves for the majority of the video, and The Firm is famous for their superior choreography and ability to incorporate fun steps in with the workouts. I don't feel that Allie put a lot of thought into this tape, or perhaps she was aiming towards new Firmers just starting out. If that is the case, I don't feel that's a good reason to deplete all of the nice moves and steps utilized in previous workouts. Beginners can work up to and advance, but for those that are advanced (which most beginners should hope to become) it could be very boring. My other Firm workouts fly by, but this one won't be one that I do so often. That said, it is a good video that will definitely burn calories. Maybe I just don't care for Allie as an instructor. I prefer Stephanie Huckabee as an aerobics leader.",1142640000,,1204,4.403587443946188
2334119,5,B0009X77I6,"As a person who is new to the FIRM series, I have to say I really enjoy this workout!  I am totally unaware of old FIRM workouts so I have nothing to base this on but I think it's great.  I won't go into total descriptions of the whole routine but coming from a person who is awkward and has difficulty getting down choreography on workout videos and aerobics, I can say that I picked up on this one quickly.  Also, I love the trasitions between aerobics and scultpting.  Everytime I do this workout, I feel like have  definitely, well, worked out!  My body has shown some big changes too and I attribute it to doing this and the others in the series.  I like Allie too, I think she is cute, upbeat, and her bod isn't overly intimidating.  She looks like a real person, who is fit, like I want to be!  My sister, who is much more athletic and into working out  saw how I have changed and bought the series and the Transfirmer too and loves it!",1142467200,,943,4.188888888888889
2334120,4,B0009X77I6,"I bought this with Ultimate Calorie Blaster & the TransFirmer.

I am very fond of this work out and use it often. It is intense. However Allie, often does not transition smoothly. I noticed the same in her Maximum Cardio Burn + Abs. Don't get me wrong I like and use both, but find my arms and/or feet coming down in one place and then having to be in the next in a heartbeat, making it a bit awkward. In addition I find myself feeling that I'm throwing my body around somewhat, rather than controlled movement, but that may be just me. OK and one big gripe...I'm really satrting to hatie this march around the box move, Allie your a good instructor, come up with something else, or try not to make this so prominent and drawn out.

However as far as it is overall, I enjoy this work-out. I feel very good when it's completed, again feeling like my body worked from my shouders to my feet-I just make myself get through the around the box thing. I use this and  Ultimate Calorie Blaster quite often in tandem with each other. And could tell my strength and tone was improving within the first few times of use. After getting over the soreness, which was welcoming in that it told me this was really working. I'd certainly recommend it.",1140307200,,1235,4.384279475982533

This video (and 2 others) comes with the Transfirmer if you purchase it. There is a 6 inch and an 8 inch step that can be used apart or combined into a 14 inch step or an incline step. Allie DelRio is the teacher on this video. She is very personable. Some of the old familiar Firm faces are also on this video but there are some new people as well. One person in the back right demonstrates the beginner moves although the camera is not always on her.

You will also need (besides the Transfirmer) 3 sets of dumb-bells: heavy, medium and light. They recommend 3, 5 and 8 lbs to start.

This video is typical of The Firm, in that it combines cardio with weight training intervals. In short, this video starts off with a warm up and some stretching and then moves into some squats with and without arm work. After some lone arm work, you will use the 14 inch step for some leg presses. Then you'll move into a short cardio step segment that utilizes the inclinced step. Then you'll do some more leg toning with the 14 inch step. This switches with some arm work. Next comes another short cardio section that you'll march up and around the incline step and you'll tap on it and do some reverse straddles. Then comes a segment where you'll use the incline step to work on your legs (with some lunges) that also switches off to arm work using the incline bench. Another short cardio section follows with a lot of low jacks and box steps. Again, you'll use the incline box for arms and legs. Then you'll move to another short cardio section with a lot of bunny hops. Then some more arm work. At the end there is some buns/thighs work that uses the 14 inch step then some ab work and a stretch. Overall this video runs just short of one hour.

The cardio segments are not as hard (nor as fun) as previous Firm videos. If you are not an experienced Firm user there will be a slight learning curve for this video... don't get discouraged! These videos are fun and you'll see results if you stick with it (or any workout program)! I don't think the stretching is especially effective and because this video isn't as hard or as fun as previous Firm's I am giving it a 4/5. Also, there is a lot of switching of Transfirmer positions and dumb-bell sizes, and usually it is done faster than I can do it. This means I usually have to stop and rewind the DVD, which is frustrating. I think overall the video is enjoyable and a decent workout.

As an added bonus there is an 8 minute lower body workout using the Transfirmer added to this DVD with lots of squats and lunges.",1140220800,,2667,4.296222664015905
2334122,5,B0009X77I6,"This workout is part of the Firm's new Transfirmer series.  The Transfirmer is a 2 part contraption similar to the Fanny Lifter but longer in length and a lot more versatile.  The 6 and 8 inch platforms can be used individually, stacked together for a 14 inch platform for the Firm's famous leg presses and tall box climbs, incline position for added intensity for step routines and strength work, or in a side by side position which resembles a staircase.  It is a great piece of equipment very sturdy and stable, definitely an improvement over the Firm Box.  This workout calls for the Transfirmer but if you don't have one you can use a normal step and a stool.  You will also need 3 sets of dumbells, light, medium and heavy.

On to the workout, Allie Del Rio leads you through 55 minutes of strength training and aerobics.  She is joined by 4 fellow Firm Master instructors including Alison who shows beginner modifications.  You begin with a simple warmup, using the 6 inch portion of the Transfirmer, though you begin on the floor for a few minutes before moving to the TF.

The first strength segment starts with heavy 4 limb work using medium weights, hover squats then adding hammer curls into overhead presses, like a clean and press in hammer position.  Then you will grab some heavy weights and do more squats and overhead presses, this time with palms facing outward.  Then you will move into leg presses on the right leg, reverse hammer curls for biceps, and finish out with leg presses on the left leg.

Time for the first cardio segment, a fun step routine performed on the incline which includes press steps with an option to add triple steps, turn steps, knee lifts, L-steps, and knee and hamstring repeaters.  Later in the segment the repeaters are performed on the 8 inch portion to add a little extra intensity but you could always just do them on the 6 inch part if you want to.

Back to strength work, more leg presses, this time you will start by doing them off the back then you will step down off to the side targeting the inner thighs a little more.  Then you will move into one arm lat rows on the right arm, then you will do some tall box climbs while using light weights (3 lbs).  Starting with the right foot you will step up and tap with the other foot, later adding glute lifts and then frontal shoulder raises.  Of course you have the option to skip the weights here if you are not ready for them.  Next are pushups done on the step, I prefer to just do them on the floor myself.  Then it's back to tall box climbs on the left leg, then one arm lat rows
with the left arm, then you will finish out this segment with leg presses on the left leg.

More incline step aerobics, this segment is actually performed more on the floor than on the step though.  You will straddle around the step, sort of like a V-step, then you will add taps on the step then reverse straddles on the step which is the only part that you are actually on the step.  I liked this segment a lot.

For the next strength segment you will leave the TF in it's incline position.  Starting with side lunges on the left leg, then you will face the TF and do double arm lat rows, then you will do forward lunges onto the incline, which to me is much safer than doing forward lunges on the floor.  Next you will lie down on the incline and do some upper body work, pec flies then ribcage pullovers.  Then you will stand back up and do a set up dips (reverse lunges), the TF is not used for this at all.

Time for low impact aerobics, Allie shows you the ""Box Step"" which is a little tricky and might take a few tries to get it down, I am still trying to master it myself.  You will also do some low jacks, repeaters (later adding hi-med-lo), with the option to do a small hop or a calf raise to keep it low impact.  This segment was a lot of fun, despite the fact that I stumble a bit while attempting those box steps.

Time for more strength work on the incline, you will repeat the side lunges on the opposite leg, then you will do french presses for the triceps, face the incline for more forward lunges, then you will lie down on the incline again for more chest work.  This time you will do bench presses later adding rotation to target the triceps some more.  Then you will do lying tricep extensions, Allie just uses one dumbell here, holding it at it's ends.  I personally use 2 dumbells as it is more comfortable for me.  Then you will stand back up and do reverse lunges (dips) which completes the standing lower body work.

One more aerobic segment which is low impact.  This segment includes bunny hops with turns, then marching up and back with power options later added, step kick/tap rears, then some mambo cha chas with triple steps.  Another fun cardio segment.

Final strength segment, here you will do bicep curls, tricep dips and rear deltoid raises.  Then you will move on the floor and do some lower body work unweighted.  You will prop your heels up on the TF and do some bridge work with inner thigh squeezes and some hip rocks from side to side.  Then you will scoot away from the TF and do some ab work.  Starting with traditional crunches, oblique twist with added knee crunches, alternating oblique twists, traditional crunches with legs extended straight out while adding knee crunches.  After this you will do a brief set of planks then it's time to cooldown and stretch.

This is my favorite in the BSS4 series, you target all the muscle groups and you get some cardio too.  The workout is fun and it seems to fly by.  Allie does a nice job leading here as always.  I would consider myself to be high intermediate to low advanced, and felt this workout was intermediate level but suitable for all fitness levels.

In additional there is a short bonus 10 minute lower body section which is led by Allie by herself.  It is floor work done while lying on the Transfirmer, I personally just do it on the floor.  Here you will see more bridge work, table work and outer/inner thigh work.  It is a nice little add on or it can be done on it's own.

I would recommend this one to anyone who enjoys the Firm workouts, it's become one of my all time favorite Firms.",1131753600,,6186,4.37215411558669
2334123,5,B0009X77I6,"I enjoy this dvd quite a bit. It is an excellent intermediate workout,which means advanced may have to really heavy up or modify in some other way. It is enjoyable and the time flies and the instructor looks great in a very ""real woman"" as opposed to ""hollywood"" way. In other words, her results are achievable. You will need the transfirmer however for best results and cardio on the transfirmer seems easier on my old knees. Good luck!!!",1120608000,,439,4.641025641025641

8069349,4,B0009X77I6,"I love the transFIRMer & the line of videos that goes along with it.  You must have the transFIRMer to utilize this video of course, but if you do this is a great full body aerobic workout that will have you looking great in no time!  The transFIRMer is an excellent workout tool that's super versatile & allows for a variety of uses, which is just kind of fun!  This one includes a good deal of leg & booty work, plus arms, abs & back work also!  You'll need a few sets of weights for this one as well, though there's a low impact girl to follow in the video who does not use weights as well.  I will say, it's a little difficult to keep up with the first couple of times through (the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars), but once you get the hang of the moves, its a great nonstop workout that will do great things for your body!",1521849600,,829,4.030487804878049

I don't have the Transfirmer, so I use my ""fanny lifter."" For the upper body weight sections done on the incline, I use my club step propped up on an ottoman (which is against a wall, so it doesn't slide away). But you can also just do those sections lying on the floor or on a regular step. This is one of my favorite workouts ever, and I have hundreds!",1509753600,,500,4.273684210526316
