8283870,5,B001BN4WJK,"I'm not one for too much political humor but when I first saw this show on Comedy Central, I fell on the floor from laughing so hard. I hope that they don't cancel the show just cause baby Bush is leaving office! My wife thinks it's a little too out there but what does she know!",1228089600,3,279,4.0
8283871,4,B001BN4WJK,"Lil' Bush is a good animated show.  It covers many sociopolitical issues of the day although not as directly as South Park and it doesn't induce laughter tears like South Park and Family Guy.  Still, there are some very funny lines and situations in these episode which can be subtle or over-the-top (usually the outlandish stuff involves Barbara Bush who is just as loose and sexually deviant, if not more so, in this season as in the first).  The second season seems to have a lot more swearing in it, some of it very funny but others seem a bit unnecessary.  Condoleezza has some major mood swings in this season and swears a lot more.  Jeb does not have as big of a role in this season and there is not as much music.  Also, all but the final episode is full-length instead of being divided into two separate episodes like in season 1.  To stretch the stories out, there are some filler elements like ""Cheneyoki,"" ""The More you Know"" take-offs, Laugh-In Skits, ""Letter Time"", and ""Demo-Bratz"" starring Lil' Hillary and Lil' Nancy Pelosi.  There are more political figures introduced in this season like Vladmir Putin, Fred Thompson, and Mitt Romney. Story and joke styles remain the same, so, if you liked season 1, you'll like this one, too.  It is also cool that they got this season out relatively quickly after it originally aired.

Disc 1:
""St. Patrick's Day""--Opening White House message: McCain endorsement.  Lil' Bush and his cronies are punished for giving Lil' Al Gore toilet ""swirlies"" (Gore: ""I hope this is a low-flow toilet"") by having to help the Lil' Dems organize a St. Patrick's Day parade.  They decide to crash the Lil' Dems all-inclusive parade plans by seeking the help of Karl Rove.  Barbara Bush suffers a tanning bed mishap.
""Big Pharma""--Opening: doctored photo of Obama.  Lil' Bush and the gang are prescribed drugs that change their personalities.  Meanwhile, Bush Sr. takes a pill to grow facial hair and ends up growing something else.
""Crony Break-Up""--Opening message: racism.  When Lil' Bush has to give an impromptu speech without it being written for him, his brain overloads.  He blames his cronies and breaks up with them, but they all find out that other friends (Lil' Fred Thompson, Lil' Rudy Giuliani, Lil' Mitt Romney) are not the same.  Jeb invents the pudding hole.
""Katrina""--Opening message: Bush Disaster Brackets (this one aired during March Madness).  With Lil' George and his cronies destroying the White House with their recreations of Katrina, Bush Sr. sends them to New Orleans to help with the re-building.
""Three Dates""--Opening message: Hillary.  Lil' George wants to take Lil' Laura to the dance, but Bush Sr. wants him to take the daughter of King Fahd for political reasons.  Meanwhile, Barbara helps Lil' Condee fatten up to catch Lil' George's attention (she looks really funny!).

Disc 2:
""Weekend at Saddamy's""--Opening message: the Pope.  Bush Sr. takes his son and his friends to Iraq for a camping trip during spring break, but spends no time with his son, so Lil' George brings back Saddam--sort of.  Meanwhile, Lil' Bill Clinton loosens up the stiff-shirted Lil' Dems with stuff he found in the airport impound room.
""Afghanistan""--Opening message: Hillary gets ""Lil' Bushed.""  Lil' Cheney is kidnapped at the mall and taken to Afghanistan.  He meets face-to-face with Osama bin Laden who wants his ""evil, indestructible black heart"" (the surgeon uses a box cutter--funny).  What's up with the ending?
""Wedding""--Opening message: the gang poses nude.  Lil' Bill Clinton invites the gang to his rainbow party.  Bush Sr. attempts the ""birds and the guilt and the bees and the shame"" talk with his son which escalates into a ""purity wedding"" with his mom (yikes!), no wait, his dad (double yikes!).  Highlight: Bush Sr. reads Barbara's vows.  Barbara then runs off with Colin Powell (weird episode).
""Pooty-Poot""--Opening message: Mother's Day.  Lil' Vladmir Putin is the new kid in school and promptly bullies Lil' George.  Bush Sr., seeing his son's eye looking ""unCaucasian,"" teaches his son about diplomacy.  Meanwhile, Cheney takes care of a watermelon baby (named Melony--ha, ha) who turns out to be a lesbian.
""Anthem/China""--Opening: spin-off ideas.  The nation needs a new national anthem and Lil' Bush and crew can't be beaten by the Lil' Dems, so they barge in on Tom Petty seeking help (""You can't break in here and force me to write a song.  Who do you think you are, Stevie Nicks?"").  Iggy Pop makes a character appearance and, I didn't realize it but, he is the voice of Lil' Rummy.  Lil' Rummy turns out to be a big Iggy Pop fan (how convenient).  In the second half, the school gym is closed because all the China-made equipment is in shoddy condition.  Also confiscated is Lil' Bush's hot dog gun.  Lil' Bush ends up betting the country against China on which nation can win the most medals in the Beijing Olympics (baby girl high dive is a new event--ha, ha).  Lil' Bush must then conquer one of his greatest fears: rope-climbing.
""Bonuses""--Audio commentaries which, based on the ones I've listen to, are actually rather informative and not just the writers goofing around like on commentaries from other shows I've heard, and ""Animatics"" (drawings) of some season 1 episodes.",1224979200,4,5264,4.9419795221843
