3722697,3,B001NPK5BK,"Dana Gould has funny material on this DVD and he keeps the pace going. There's only one spot where I got a little squeamish.
What made this DVD hard to watch was the photography. They decided to use one harsh spotlight and little or no fill lighting, so there's this dark shadow stalking Gould on the wall immediately behind him for much of the show. I found it distracting. Perhaps this was intentional to go with Gould's reputation as an alternative comic. Too me it just seemed low budget.
Another part I didn't like was Gould's glaring into the camera. I'm not familiar with his work but I'm guessing this is a trademark move. The DVD seemed to grind to a halt, though, when Gould would stop and stare directly into the lens.
To me, this says Bob Odenkirk should stick to writing and performing and not directing.",1262476800,4,817,4.527027027027027

8327737,3,B001NPK5BK,"Not your typical Dana Gould.  This has the feel that Dana did this one because he needed money.  It is forced and lacks the energy that his fans have come to expect.  Funny, but leaves a lot to be desired.",1468627200,,205,4.075

8327740,4,B001NPK5BK,"I gave this a four, because it is about 80% as enjoyable as his Dana Gould Hour Podcast, which is a rare treat. He has grown and evolved since this performance, but that does not detract from the fact that Dana Gould is a great comedic mind deserving of our support.",1396656000,,266,4.235294117647059
