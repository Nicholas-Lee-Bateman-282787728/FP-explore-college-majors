Watching it inspires me to loosen up and let the paint do the work.  Love her willingness to let go and wait for surprises!!!",1393372800,10,256,4.565217391304348

8453587,5,B00526S87E,"The video gives many examples of her techniques--wet in wet, backgrounds, spattering with a palette knife, edges soft and hard, use of color, use of a gesso background, selective use of plastic wrap film, use of multimedia as well as watercolor.  Her paintings exhibit a playfulness, a joy of experimentation.  Diana Rost",1414886400,5,321,5.153846153846154
