8305757,1,B001GKA4ZE,"The worst Brazilian music I have heard in years--and I am a true Brazilian music aficionado. These songs sound so lacking in depth and complexity, not to mention the essential elements of what we seek for in great Brazilian music: state of the art percussion, unusually sophisticated arrangements, outstanding vocals, and complex lyrics. This is a true disappointment. Another marketing move by Brazilian media, sertanejo (Brazilian name for tacky, cheap, and overly commercial ""country""--a watered down version of the real thing). NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY. I hope this is not where Brazilian music in going... that would be a waste!",1406764800,,637,5.254901960784314
