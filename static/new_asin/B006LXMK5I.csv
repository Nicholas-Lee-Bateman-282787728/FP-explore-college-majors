5926506,1,B006LXMK5I,"I will never order ""Keeping up with the Kardashians"" or The City...not my cup of tea.  The Kardashians are obnoxtious and spoiled brats",1319414400,4,135,4.869565217391305
5926507,5,B006LXMK5I,Love the dvd! I am a big time Kardashianaholic so of course i am satisfied with the product.  It took longer than usaul for it to arrive but all in all i am completely satisfied.,1298505600,,178,4.085714285714285
5926508,4,B006LXMK5I,Most shows that have a short first and second season would package them together but not this one...Pretty sure season 1 and 2 are each 10 episodes which is about 3 hours. The 2 seasons really shoulve been put together but other then that its a fun show to watch,1289347200,,262,4.26
5926509,5,B006LXMK5I,I love watching Keeping Up With The Kardashians.  I watch it on tv every sunday.  I have never seen it from the beginning. I bought season 1 and 2 at the same time. Can't wait to watch them.,1278460800,,190,3.973684210526316
5926510,5,B006LXMK5I,I love Keeping Up with the Kardashians. It is my favorite show and I was so happy to finally get this season on DVD. It shipped super fast and was brand new just like they said. :),1269561600,,180,3.891891891891892
5926511,5,B006LXMK5I,I have enjoyed the show for the past couple of years. What I like the most is that this is a family that really cares about one another.,1267401600,,136,3.892857142857143
5926512,4,B006LXMK5I,"So I'll be the first to admit that season 1 is more entertaining than season 2...but I'll be completely honest here, this show could become the worst show on television and I'd still watch it. Luckily though, it's not the worst show on television. Season 2 is still great. The dvd however is lacking. Just as the first season on dvd, it is censored and lacking in extras. But for the price, I'd say it's worth the purchase.",1264118400,5,423,4.435897435897436
5926513,3,B006LXMK5I,This klan hit a slump this season...not that season one was oscar winning material but it was entertaining.,1262649600,,107,5.0
5926514,5,B006LXMK5I,"This is a fun family. They have fun together. Kourtney, Kim , and Khloe are three of the funnest women on the show. Although Khloe is my favorite. She is a kick ass kinda girl. She's the only one who has the guts to tell people like it is. In the end, It's purely fun entertainment!",1262563200,2,282,4.053571428571429
5926515,4,B006LXMK5I,"A guilty pleasure show to watch on E!.  Aired spring of 2008.
Season 2.
Well, we get more episodes in the 2cd season.  The 1 that will tug at the heart strings is the last episode when they go to New Orleans & help a family out who lost their home in the 2005 Katrina storm.

No special extras.  A few deleted scenes & a video segment with Rob.

Now, here are the problems with it 1.  EPISODES ARE NOT UNCUT.  Come on.  The Girls Next Door DVD's are uncut they have nudity & language.  Why is this show NOT shown uncut?  I am very disappointed in that. 2.  This HORRIBLE & CHEAP DVD case/holder.  It has intentional HOLES IN IT ON BOTH FRONT & BACK  Cheap, stupid & THOUGHTLESS 3.  No commentary as well on the episodes

At lease it does have a chapter/episode list.  BUT, the 1st season DVD said the original air dates for the episodes  Season 2 does NOT

Let us hope the DVD for season 3 is better than this",1258156800,10,909,4.097142857142857
5926516,5,B006LXMK5I,"Great value for the early seasons, if you like the Kardashians you will like this season.  It is so cool to see them when they first started filming and weren't super famous yet.  Better than the newest seasons.",1466899200,,211,4.526315789473684

5926529,5,B006LXMK5I,This DVD is awesome! My favorite thing about the DVD is that it has lots of special features and the season 1 DVD does not have many special features. This DVD is so worth the money.,1419984000,,182,4.083333333333333

5926536,5,B006LXMK5I,"Picks up right where Season One left off. The Kardashians are at it once again, doing one crazy, hilarious thing after another. It is up to Kris Jenner, as the matriarch of the family, to bring order to this chaos and remind the girls that love and family always come first.",1386547200,,274,4.392156862745098
