3853835,5,B0026IQTQ8,I'm glad I bought this dvd. It goes hand in hand with the book.  I feel I got a very good understanding of her thinking from reading the book and then reviewing this dvd. Interesting is the best word to describe what I think about this.,1323302400,,236,4.130434782608695
3853836,5,B0026IQTQ8,I ENJOYED IT BECAUSE EVERYONE KEPT IT REAL! I LEARNED A LOT FROM THE SHOW. I RECORDED & WATCHED IT ON SHOWTIME CHANNEL.,1290384000,,119,4.217391304347826
3853837,3,B0026IQTQ8,"Basically, the video is about men in the industry along w/a hater female whom happens to be married to the baby daddy. She appears to be jealous and sour because she is not in the lime light. She calls herself a rapper, that one one has heard of and keeps going on and on about Karrine. The rest of the video is men in the industry that has been w/her and want to keep their skeletons in the closet. Every one knows what goes on in the industry, If you don't want your business out there, then keep your clothes on.. bottom line. I am not mad at Karrine for doing what she had to do to make money, men use women all the time and think nothing of it. Maybe this will make them stop and think how it feels to have your dirty laundry aired out.",1255996800,15,741,4.013513513513513
3853838,3,B0026IQTQ8,"Wow superhead is really a poor quality individual. She is fairly triffling. Interestingdvd if you are interested in the story, definitely pick this up or rent it.",1255219200,2,162,5.037037037037037
3853839,5,B0026IQTQ8,It is an inside look into the Hip Hop video industry.  A must have if you are curious about what goes on behind the curtains!  It's not a pro-Karrine Steffans at all although it is very fair in balancing the point of view of the video vixen.  Lots of sex going on and Wendy Williams should give up her day job and narrate docs!  The title sequence is halarious.  The DVD extras are great as well and unless you are a total prude you'll really enjoy this.,1250035200,11,454,4.172413793103448
8352677,4,B0026IQTQ8,It was nice to hear interviews from the people in Karrine Steffan 's life however this is all things she covered in her books and interviews.,1527465600,,141,4.461538461538462

8352683,2,B0026IQTQ8,"The only reason I gave this movie any stars because it gives a peak into the world of hip hop. It was degrading and disrespectful only because Karrine wasn't in the documentary to give he raise of each story. Very one sided, like an attack. The documentary was entertaining and informative, I just wish she had a POV as well. I probably won't watch this or another doc like this again.",1447113600,3,385,4.436619718309859
8352684,3,B0026IQTQ8,"They should have advertised that this was mostly a documentary about Karrine Steffans, not groupies and/or video girls in general",1438041600,,129,5.5
