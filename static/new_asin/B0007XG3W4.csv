8490376,1,B0007XG3W4,"The all too often out of breath American militia Leader (Dan Haggerty) gives a painfully mind numbing performance as an uninspiring Military Captain during the revolutionary war. Rick Washburn also joins this rag-tag team as a British Commander attempting to provide some comic relief but ultimately leaves you begging for relief from this hopeless movie. On the back of the DVD it says it is much akin to the spirit and theme of Dances with Wolves and to which I can only respond by quoting the ninth commandment, ""Thou shalt not bear false witness"". Heaven help us all that this movie may never find its way into our DVD players. It's only saving grace is that it's rated PG. If you have children that you don't mind making dumber, buy this movie for them. It's a great sedative.",1144886400,,781,4.666666666666667
