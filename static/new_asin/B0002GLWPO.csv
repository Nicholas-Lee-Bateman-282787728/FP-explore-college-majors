Well, the movie turned out to be excellent.  The story was basically the same as the book, but at the end a few of the details were left out, but only details that I thought could be considered exterraneous to the story.  Alex Kellerman's books are an ongoing saga about the life of a psychiatrist who consults with the police department.  He has a partner with the police dept, and an ongoing girlfriend.  The book portrayed by the movie is the one where he meets both his partner and girlfriend.  An ongoing saga always has a beginning, so the placement of these characters was needed in the book.  But the movie was a lone movie, and only the basic story was needed.  The characters were wonderful.  Ted Danson made a great Alex Delaware, and Masur a great Milo Sturgiss, although I felt that Danson's character could have been a little less emotional.  But all in all, I thought it was an interesting movie and a great portrayal of the book.",1331510400,,1090,4.44949494949495
2098369,5,B0002GLWPO,"Since I'm an avid Jonathan Kellerman fan, especially for those books that feature Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis, I just had to have this DVD.

I don't think I ever saw this movie before, even though it came out in the eighties, and I can't even remember reading this book.  Probably one I missed, although there are references to this story in later books.

Fast-paced and intriguing, I so enjoyed watching Ted Danson and Richard Masur play the dynamic crime-fighting team.  Like many other books by Kellerman, this one ends with this mighty duo solving the mystery and putting the bad guys away (in one form or another!).

In some ways, the Alex Delaware character seemed more outside the bounds of the law than he does in later works.  I'm thinking that he is still a novice, at this point.

I also enjoyed seeing Alex's home in the hills, a feature in the books that I've only imagined until now.

2098370,4,B0002GLWPO,"This 1986 made for TV film is fine adaptation of a Jonathan Kellerman hit novel, featuring his long time hero, Dr. Alex Delaware, played by Ted Danson and, Delawares police buddy, played by Richard Masur. Ted Danson, a co-producer of the film, doesn't reach for laughs, but gives a sensitive performance as a psychologist, who takes to heart the problems of the  youngsters with whom he works. Richard Masur, in his supporting role, epitomizes the policeman  with a heart, who also knows that his job is always on the line, since he is  Gay. That aspect of his life is barely shown or mentioned save to enlarge upon the reasons for his greater caution in pursuing the goals he shares with Delaware. Supporting players add luster to the film, there are no soft spots in the casting. As is true for any novel used as a springboard for a TV film, the many readers of Kellerman should enjoy this rendering but will note the serious cuts required in the transition from literary  to cinematic presentation.
If you are buying from Amazon or one of its affiliated sellers, be sure to  look for the DVD combo: this film and Concrete Cowboys, starring Tom Selleck, another detective yarn. Two for the price of one, both technically good viewing, and available at bargain prices from affiliates, it shouldn't be overlooked.",1231200000,,1313,4.766519823788546
2098371,5,B0002GLWPO,"This is a made for TV movie based on the novel of the same name written by Jonathan Kellerman. Ted Danson is great as Dr. Alex Delaware, but Richard Masur is perfect as Detective Milo Sturgis. I mean, his hair is more red than black and he's a couple inches too short, but still - so perfect.

It follows the book fairly closely and starts with the trial of a notorious pedaphile. Dr. Alex Delaware is the child psychologist assigned to help threat the traumatized victims and when the defendant (out on bail) commits suicide in his office, the whole thing is too much for Alex and he retires.

Retirement is taking it's toll, though - Alex is a mess, so his pal Detective Milo Sturgis figures getting him involved in another case will help get him out of his funk. Well, it works too damned well and he has created a Police Consultant monster as Alex goes off on his own investigating and stepping on toes and making Milo's life a little more

difficult in the bargain.

It's a nasty tale of big shot perversion and Alex digs deep enough to endanger his own life. Can Milo get to him in time to save him?

The ending is a little different than the book and I haven't decided yet which I like better.

It's a nice little film - I really like the fact that it's not condescending - it doesn't explain everything in neat little sound bytes - you might have to think a little bit on your own to figure everything out, which means you might realize something new each time you watch it. The chemistry between Alex and Milo and between Milo and his lover Rick

is just too damned cute.",1148774400,,1580,4.335593220338983

8027917,2,B0002GLWPO,"This was a wonderful book, and I personally think Richard Masur was a good choice for the character of Milo Sturgis back in the 80s, but Ted Danson's dramatic performance was so absurd that it actually made the Alex Delaware character seem like a fragile China doll.  His ending scene was so ridiculously played that I had to refrain from laughing...not at the seriousness of the situation, but at how unbelievable he was.  It was like watching a bad Meryl Streep performance.  Not sure why they didn't cast a more masculine character to play Alex Delaware.  If you do decide to purchase this movie or watch it for free on Amazon Prime, just keep in mind that the Alex Delaware character is nothing like the book...Think of it like casting Chris Rock to play Mike Tyson or Vin Diesel to portray George W. Bush.",1488585600,,810,4.604166666666667

8027921,3,B0002GLWPO,"Wasn't sure I would like this movie - since they got Milo Sturgis' characterization wrong from the get-go. In character, he is not a pretty face or a fit person.  Not sure why that was something they could not hold more true to form when they cast the part - but I gave the movie a chance - after all, anything from this series has to be good.  Or so I thought.

Hugely disappointed in the fundamental difference in characterization of both Milo ad Alex  between awesome book and mediocre movie.

Starting out with Milo and Alex as friends before the suicide committed in Alex's office - completely re-writes an important component of their relationship - much better with the book's portrayal.

Somehow, Movie Alex after witnessing the bleached version of what took place in his office, dating someone instead of staying true to the character portrayed in the book; not already dating and completely secluding himself from the world as he succumbed to the breakdown he suffered, was portrayed as this shallow, self-serving, almost rude jerk who quickly experiences tunnel-vision.

the complete absence of his now new relationship with Robin - sorely missed as part of this story, as well.

the confrontation between the two doctors while Melody is experiencing night-terrors - should have been more fully played out - and more accurately, as in with Milo being the one to call Alex and  present as a witness- as written in the book. It was a very enlightening interaction between Milo and Alex and the movie should have portrayed it better - instead it cut Milo out of it completely.

Having Alex actually meet Rick in person, whom, i might add, wasn't even Milo's significant other yet. I have to say, was one aspect of the movie, that while completely different from the original story, actually worked well.

And what about the actual relationship between the child witness and the doctor?  To completely leave that out just cuts a huge junk of the connecting storyline out - leaving a 'huh'? feeling to how some of the pieces fit/don't fit.

But, the ending, in which we see a far less charactor fortified Alex than the one we find in the book - breaking down so - was the biggest disappointment to me.  To erode his strength - at the same time, belittling the beating he took - so that he has almost no injuries? -

hugely disappointed.",1409702400,,2342,4.71990171990172
