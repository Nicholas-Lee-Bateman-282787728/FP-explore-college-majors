8336889,5,B001QYI1CS,"A Haunting has been one of my favorites since the pilot, 'A Haunting in Connecticut' premiered back in 2002 and was disappointed when the show was canceled in 2007 after four excellent seasons. (The show was later renewed in 2012 by Destination America.)

I was pretty excited to find A Haunting-Spirits From The Past. The cover art is pretty cool and I was thinking these were new episodes. No Such Luck. The four episodes in this set: Monster In The Apartment, Spellbound, Spirits of the Dead, and Echoes of the Past are creepy. They are presented in 1.33 full frame and spread across two dvds. This would be great except all the episodes are from the previously released Season Four.

So BEWARE! If you own the Season Four Box Set, there is no reason to spend your money on this. This might be good as an inexpensive gift for someone but If you don't own any of A Haunting Sets, I'd recommend buying the season sets that over this sampler.",1428796800,,942,4.535294117647059

8336891,1,B001QYI1CS,Here I thought I was getting a new series on the Haunting series judged by the title. Low and behold when I opened I already have the series! It's under a different name. Total waste of my time! I had the same issue on the 3 other DVDs that are on Amazon. All they are are the Haunting series 1-4 but under a different name. Why???!!!,1290988800,10,334,4.075757575757576
