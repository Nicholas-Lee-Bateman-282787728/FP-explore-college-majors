8691564,5,B00QJAZ49C,"My four year old loves Zack & Quack which doesn't surprise me at all. When I ask him why he likes them so much, the first thing he says is ""they are pop-up book people"".  This is an adorable series where you can follow Zack and his friend Quack on all types of adventures.  This is their first appearance on DVD;  Episodes include:
Zack & Quack Pop-Up Circus
Popping Hopping Hiccups
The Poppy-Up Flower
The Poparang 3000
The Pop Up Easter Egg Hunt
