8212860,2,B000UCD4JW,"It is historical, it is unique, but make no mistake of it, it is also boring. The cinematography is basic, the acting, almost amateuristic by western standards, and the film drags. It is poorly edited and unless one really is interested in watching early film in western Africa, I would avoid this film. The most interesting part of the film is in the extras with a discussion of the intra-African slave trade. Not a single white person is in this film. However, for the collector of interesting offshoots of film this certainly will make the grade..",1469836800,,550,4.739583333333333

8212863,5,B000UCD4JW,"This is an interesting, well scripted and directed, revealing film. Mr. M'Bala gives us ""historical facts that are generally misrepresented or deliberately ignored"" (his words). He reveals the fact that African kings, emperors and people were as complicit in ""the trade"" as any European or New England slave trader, any slave ship captain, slave broker, purchaser or owner. The scenes are very revealing as to the treatment received by those captured and sold, the conditions under which they were held and the atrocities they had to bear at the hands of their own ""countrymen"". The subtitles are extremely helpful in understanding the presentation. The price of this film is a ""bit pricey"" at $30 a pop. Hopefully, the director will lower it to about $10 per to make it more affordable to ""Jane & Joe Citizen"" and give this fine work a much wider distribution. This film is the subject of a review in SpencerG's latest publication.

8212867,5,B000UCD4JW,"A pearcing examination of a little examined side of the Atlantic slave trade, the complicity of African tribesman and chiefs in the capture and sale to Europeans of African slaves.
Complete with African slave auctions and mouth inspections.
Vivid and with excellent filmography and dramatic acting, it is directed by Ivorian filmmaker Roger Gnoan M'Bala.
The ruthless King Adanggaman (Rasmane Ouedraogo) leads a war against neighbouring tribes selling the young and strong men and women into slavery.
After a young man Ossei (Ziable Honor Goore Bi)  falls into conflict with his father after being pressured to marry a woman he does not love, he leave his village to return to find his village destroyed, his father and his beloved slaughtered and his mother taken captive.
SPOILER WARNING
He attempts to rescue his mother unsuccessfully and is captured by Adanggamans fearsome Amazon warriors.
Afte his mother is put to death by Adanggaman, Ossei again escaped and form a romance with Amazon warrior, Naka (Mylne-Perside Boti Kouame).
Together Ossei and Naka lead an idyllic but precarious existence before being discovered by the Amazons.
Naka is murdered and Ossei enslaved before being sent across the Atlantic as a slave.
Quite penetrating, a mix of history, myth and imagination, it nevertheless deals with a little examined part of the slave trade. Not a single White person appears in the movie, as it focuses purely on the African side of these events.
Dramatic and vivid, in a unique West African syle, in a moment of philosophical observation Ossei remarks that ""
The dead are sometimes more alive than the living themselves"".
A gem of West African cinema.",1203811200,3,1667,5.1286764705882355
8212868,4,B000UCD4JW,"Adanggaman is a stark look at the slave trade during the 17th century. The story is s fictionalized historic account that takes place on the West Coast of Africa. The film gives a twist to the tradional versions of slave trade, as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roots-Four-Disc-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000NA21S6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roots (Four-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;by examining the role of Africans in the slave trade. The final destination many slaves made to the Americas(only about 5% came to the U.S.) is mentioned but never made to be that important. Instead the focus is on the slaves being sold to other tribes. They are subjugated to less than wild animal tratment. The story is part travelogue, part life in the bush drama. King Adanggaman is a vile man with an insatiable appetite for power; his lust is disgusting. His tribesman carry out raids and capture other tribes and the men are sold for animals in exchange. An auction will deliver two goats, two sheep, one cow and a bonus like yams thrown in for good measure to assure the winning bid. The awaiting slaves are kept in primitive  cages. It is not a pretty picture but then again slavery wasn't either. Anyway, the story centers on Ossei who manages to avoid capture, tries to free his mother , only  to be caught by the feared and vicious  women Amazons. These are some bad, tough women warriors. They capture Ossei, he escapes  with the help of a Amazonian(not to be confused with people who frequent this site), is recaptured and the story continues. The movie is a nice alternative perspective to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amistad/dp/0783231202/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amistad</a>&nbsp;and since it is made by an African director, seems rather credible. It has a documentary feel to it at times but there is enough storyline that keeps it flowing to seperate the movie from a docudrama. It is a very provocative film. It also  has some great costumes worn by the tribes, realistic sets in the bush and is in some African language with subtitles, that at times, are unneccessary. As they were herding the slaves along, jibbering about with no subtitles, we jokingly added our own, "" hurry up, keep moving, come on, keep moving."" We were dead on as they eventually threw in almost the exact dialogue! This is a good rendering of the African slave experience that all should see for a different perspective. It does have some  National Geographic type nudity and suttle violence but otherwise it is suitable for most families viewing. Recommended as an alternate view of the slave trade.",1201478400,5,2687,5.355450236966824
