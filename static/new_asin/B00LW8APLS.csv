8668502,5,B00LW8APLS,"Italy produces wonderful dramas and docu-dramas. This one is no exception. Great acting, of course-- Luca Zingarelli stars as Paolo Borsellino. The 57 Days is a more recent film than The Judge, but both films give a good overview of how these two worked together against the Mafia in Sicily. Language is easy to understand, for those not quite fluent in Italian, and subtitles are easy to read. Both films live up to the Italian ability to mix fact, emotion, and art into an entertaining, informative experience.",1411603200,4,512,4.896551724137931
