7998547,3,B000008TYG,"I appreciated all the reviews - helped me in selecting this tape.  However, I have a weak knee so I do all my exercising without jumping or leaping.  Karen claims to have representatives doing low impact, well I had to make a few modifications (nothing new).  If I had to do it again, I'd buy something else, but will add it to my collection & just not use it as often.  Otherwise it is a great workout if you like Karen's style.",1170288000,,429,4.195121951219512
