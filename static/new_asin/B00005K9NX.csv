8195363,5,B00005K9NX,This Dvd was an awesome buy for anyones DBZ collection. You could truley see in these three episodes how Goten and Trunks were going to become great warriors!! :),1198627200,,162,4.620689655172414
8195364,5,B00005K9NX,"The first episode and 1/2 are pretty boring(except the video of Hercule beating Cell) but the fight between Goten and Trunks is awesome.  They both end up going Super Saiyan at on point, but the flying and Ki blasts are what really made Videll and the old man's eyes pop out.  It is a really cool fight.",1087948800,,303,4.298245614035087
8195365,5,B00005K9NX,"This DBZ movie is the best one EVER!! Since Trunks and Goten are my favotite characters, which this movie includes, all I can say is, ""I JUST LOVE IT""! I can't live without it! I like the DVD version better because u don't have to rewind it, which is very convinient!!! I love Dbz, I have seen EVERY episode made, but I most definatley LOVE the episodes of this movie the best of all. P.S. just remember to get the DVD version instead on the VHS, it is much better and less of a hassle.",1012608000,2,486,4.126315789473685
8195366,3,B00005K9NX,"The first episode and a half weren't that exciting.  Kids ""fight"" in the junior division and it's really not that exciting until the finals: Goten VS Trunks.  It's a great fight between the two and definitely worth seeing.  The menu is animated and has lots of options.",1006387200,,269,4.680851063829787
8195367,5,B00005K9NX,"After the sometimes-corny seriousness of the Cell Saga, the new world tournament provides a great comic relief.  This episode has some classic moments, as the proud parents cheer on their budding warriors.  Although there is really no competition for Trunks and Goten until they battle each other, the other bouts are hilarious, especially watching Trunks taunt the other boys... Gee, I wonder where he learned that evil smirk??  This is a must for anybody who enjoys Dragonball or DragonballZ.  Just make sure to have the tissues ready... you'll laugh so hard you'll cry at Bulma and Chi-Chi rooting in the stands!!!",995846400,6,617,5.079207920792079
8195368,4,B00005K9NX,"Before the adult main event, there's the Jr. event and with Goten and Trucks entering, guess who going to the finals.  Very funny when Goten and Trunks are individually competeing against other 'normal' kids. Without giving away who wins the Jr. event, its great to see Mr. Satan taking on the winner and get punched by one of the Jr. Sayians.  One of the best tapes before the start of the Boo Series.  4 stars because its dubbed.",987379200,6,431,4.5
