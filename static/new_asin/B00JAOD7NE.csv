6351746,5,B00JAOD7NE,"I have been a Zumba instructor and am now a certified REFIT instructor. REFIT has been an answer to my prayers. While I enjoyed Zumba, I wasn't extremely fond of the music. I love the REFIT music selections - I think they have my playlist in their studio! :-)

You will have so much fun dancing that you won't feel like you're working out (although you will know it by how much you will sweat!). Order both REFIT Dance Fitness DVD Volume 1 and REFIT Dance Fitness DVD Volume 2!",1396742400,4,477,4.3

Their values combined with their personalities cater to a a diverse crowd.  The video has women of different fitness levels and their heart is as true as they portray.  All of the music is clean and the moves are fun!  It is a great way to do with your children.
I began my fitness journey this way and with my 8 and 13 year old girls.  They love it as much as I do.  We even brought it into our community!",1396742400,,440,3.9545454545454546
6351750,5,B00JAOD7NE,"This is my very first review.  I have ordered many workout DVD's in the past, but this is the first one I feel the need to write a review about.  If you are looking for a workout DVD that is great for not only beginners but even the advanced, then this is the one for you!  I own both volumes and I have NEVER EVER gotten tired of them.  The music is sooooo uplifting and the routines are easy to learn.  The routines are fit for any age, what a great DVD to workout with the family or a group!  The dance trio on this DVD will have you sweating and feeling energized by the end!  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!  Trust the reviews on this one, if I could give a 10 star I sure would!  Welcome to a whole new dance revolution!!!!  Order yours before they sell out!!!!!  #lovemesomerefit",1396742400,5,785,4.132450331125828

8649457,5,B00JAOD7NE,"So much fun! I appreciate the fact that they have easy to follow, yet very high energy, dance moves. They have way more swag than I can muster, but I do this privately at home so...it's all good.",1504396800,,195,4.157894736842105
8649458,4,B00JAOD7NE,I got this dvd a long with another dvd called Shazzy.  REFIT is so much easier to follow then Shazzy and for a beginner like me I found it easier to keep up with REFIT.  There was a lot of Toby Mac on this dvd and several spanish sung songs I've never heard of.  LIke the Toby Mac and the one at the end that was a cool down.  Over all great upbeat Christian music and fun to do.,1491609600,2,379,3.759493670886076

8649464,5,B00JAOD7NE,One day I was working out to some dance videos on You Tube. I felt really guilty because dancing is my favorite form of exercise but the music was really inappropriate and the dance moves were too provacative. Then Refit Revolution came up as one of the recommended videos on the side of the video. I clicked on it and I've been hooked ever since. I would definitely recommend both DVDs. The music is great and the dance moves are fun. God is good. <3 :),1403654400,5,454,4.290697674418604
8649465,5,B00JAOD7NE,Great product.  Great music and wonderful exercise.  Fun to do.  Would highly recommend for all ages and level of fitness.,1401235200,,122,5.0
