2318351,5,B0009SQNOU,I chose this DVD because I wanted to muti-task; combining meditation and exercise.  Its harder than it looks!!!  They did very well in how they introduced the movements and I absolutley adored the use of the Goddess poses and names.,1141862400,4,232,4.775
2318352,5,B0009SQNOU,"Working with The Goddess Dancing's new videotape, Belly Dancing The Sacred Shapes with The Goddess Dancing, has been an enjoyable and meaningful experience for me.

Led by the members of The Goddess Dancing, Anita-Cristina Calcaterra, Cathy Moore and Karen Uminski, the program pursues an easy to follow format.  Throughout the video, the teachers give clear instructions, as well as gentle proper alignment reminders.

Following a warm up, the three teachers take us through dance movements divided into five segments, each born from what the describe as The Sacred Shapes: the circle, the crescent, the figure eight, the shimmy, and the undulation.  They do each shape in a variety of ways, one by one, with the hips, the heart, and the head.  The shapes are described in relationship to both our bodies and the physical world.  The teachers use poetic and scientific imagery to help the viewer to experience and draw the shapes with her body.  With some of the moves, they explain which muscles are being used, which I found helpful.  Here is a portion of the instruction given in the circle segment:

""Control you pelvis by imagining your hips are a shallow bowl filled with your essence.  You are swirling your essence around in this bowl.  Try not to spill a drop!...  In order to keep level all the way around, the diaphragm works as a counterbalance for the hips.  In the front the lower abdomen is expanded; on the sides the obliques around your waist are activated to pull the hipbone down, keeping the hips on a horizontal plane; in the back the lower back stretches down, rather than swinging out.""

The tape ends with The Creation Dance; danced to a poem written by Anita-Cristina, which allows the viewer to incorporate all the shapes she has just learned.

The relaxed and heartfelt flow between and emanating from the three teachers, as well as the attractive set and beautiful music, create a mellow and uplifting mood.

Belly Dancing The Sacred Shapes with The Goddess Dancing gave me a fresh perspective and positively affected my belly dancing experience.  In the past year and a half I have had the good fortune to take numerous classes and workshops with a variety of wonderfully skilled and talented Oriental dance teachers.  I have also used several belly dance videotapes.  Yet, the more techniques and moves I learned, the more frustrated I became.  Not a frustration that practice and perseverance could remedy.  I felt a disconnect within.  My body wanted to move; it craved to be an instrument of the rhythm.  Yet, something was keeping me from connecting to my inner dance.  The Goddess Dancing's video was the breakthrough I needed.  Awakening the shapes within my body realigned me with the natural energies that already live within and without.  Some of the shapes that were so challenging before, particularly the undulation began to flow through me.  My body breathed a sigh of relief.  Now it could express itself from the inside out, rather than unsuccessfully struggling to do so from the outside in.

With this newly awakened inner resource, I believe that I will also be able to internalize and manifest many of the dance moves I have previously learned.  For now, though, when I hear the music and my body wants to move, I simply remember the shapes and let the shapes moves me.  Feels so good, so natural...",1136764800,35,3349,4.863957597173145
2318353,2,B0009SQNOU,"It was a good video for the first couple times I worked with it, but since, it's become a bit repetitive and dull.  Granted, I have some experience with belly dancing, and it was nice to see the basics described as being different movements than I learned them to be in my classes, but it just seemed far too easy.  It did help me tone my muscles a little after my daughter was born, but I got far more of a workout from my other practices and lessons.  In general, it'd be good for a beginner, but unless you really feel a strong tie to the spiritual side of the video, then you would be better choosing something more advanced.",1131840000,,629,4.225
2318354,5,B0009SQNOU,I'm having a ball! This is a great introduction to the art of belly dancing expecially for those of us intimidated by the idea of going to a class or simply don't have time.  The step by step instruction gives beginners a chance to learn how to focus on the movement and how to reproduce it. It is also a great form of exercise. I'm gaining muscle tone (an unexpected plus)and also have a ball showing a select few my new dance moves. The DVD gives you an overview and the history of belly dancing and a performance by the  DVD instructors. Join the fun!,1126310400,3,554,4.266666666666667
2318355,5,B0009SQNOU,"Are you experimenting with Belly Dance for the first time?  Has belly dancing become so mechanical that you have lost the previously experienced joy?  Do your belly dance classes need a new angle, flow, or direction?  If you answered ""Yes"" to any of these questions, then this DVD/video may benefit you.

Belly Dancing the Sacred Shapes provides a fun introduction to Belly Dance from a more spiritual perspective than found in other instructional dance videos.  Designed for ""the health and celebration of women,"" Goddesses, Sacred Shapes, directional planes, visualizations, and stories are incorporated into the overall format.  This is a very well thought-out video with a focused structure.  In addition, the audio, picture, lighting, framing, camera, and editing are of a professional quality.  Everything about this production is clean, clear, and concise.  Moreover, the set design and colors utilized in the framing were pleasant to the eyes.

The three ladies involved in The Goddess Dancing, Anita-Cristina Calcaterra, Cathy Moore, and Karen Uminski, each take their turn as leader.  As one lady verbally introduces the shape or topic, another lady illustrates the topic with her body.  Likewise, while a voiceover verbally explains each move, the dancers illustrate the movement with their bodies.  The Goddess Dancing appears to be a fun group; the members' smiles and sincerity reflected towards each other perfectly illustrate the ""sisterhood"" often found in Belly Dance.  With each chapter, the group illustrates a different theme of costuming whether through practice attire, performance attire, or ""clubbing"" attire.

What a creative, yet complete introductory video.  I give a big round of applause to The Goddess Dancing.

8066283,5,B0009SQNOU,"Recently I injured a shoulder and have had to do workouts with minimal arm movements. My job stress has also increased, and I find myself reluctant to attempt complex workouts that only further stress me out.  For these reasons, Belly Dancing The Sacred Shapes has been--well, a goddess-send.

I actually feel rejuvenated after doing this instructional/workout--an effect similar to qigong.  The pace of many of the movements is slow and deliberate, like qigong.  The predominantly circular movements are also reminiscent of qigong, with a welcome activation of sinovial fluid in the joints.

The instruction in this DVD is divided into 5 sections based on type of movement:  circle, crescent, figure 8, shimmies, and undulation.  A 6th section puts it all together in a routine called ""The Creation Dance"".

Instruction is well-balanced--neither overwhelmingly detailed nor skimpy.  Movements are clearly demonstrated, and there is sufficient practice time.  The 3 dancers who take turns instructing are appealingly mature and real-looking.

Even though this is a beginner-level instructional and I am an intermediate-level exerciser, there were still a few moves that were new and challenging for me (snake; figure 8 of the neck).

I would highly recommend Belly Dancing The Sacred Shapes for all levels and ages of beginners, as well as for more advanced dancers/exercisers who might want to go back to the basics, for whatever reason.",1330560000,,1438,5.370535714285714
8066284,3,B0009SQNOU,"I bought this video to suppliment a bellydancing class I am taking.  Although it did help me understand all the horizontal and vertical circles the body can make, overall it was VERY BASIC and VERY SLOW.  The dancers themselves are great and you do get to see a pretty dance in the bonus features.  But if you're looking for a workout or any really flashy moves, don't buy this video!",1220918400,,384,4.457142857142857
8066285,4,B0009SQNOU,"I really wish I had had this DVD when I started dancing. The instruction is clear, with an emphasis on proper (and safe) dance posture. For a beginner, I think that is absolutely the most important thing, especially if you aren't able to take actual classes as well. For more advanced dancers, this can serve as a good review of the basics.

There are a couple of downsides: there is a warm up but no cooldown, although the choreography that ends the video is probably slow enough to serve as a cooldown on its own. Also, this is an instructional video, not a workout, and will probably not get your heart rate up much if you are already in shape; so if you are looking for more of a workout rather than instruction, this is probably not the video for you. The thing that I think would be most frustrating to a beginner is that while they teach isolations very well, that is *all* they teach on this video--no travel steps at all, so if you are depending solely on this video to learn to belly dance, you will end up dancing in place!

If you get this DVD (and I definitely do recommend it for beginners), be sure to check out the ""Special Performance"" in the extras; it is a nice performance and includes sword as well as floor work and belly work.",1208390400,2,1249,4.333333333333333

The moves are taught in a simple, concise manner and demonstrated beautifully by the wonderful women of the Goddess Dancing. I got this quite some time ago and use is constantly to re-inforce what I learn in my weekly classes. I've been dancing for close to three years now but find ""Belly Dancing the Sacred Shapes"" an invaluable resource to keep me focused.

8066288,5,B0009SQNOU,I enjoy this tape very much and have found it very helpful in beginning to learn how to belly dance. I also enjoy the Goddess imagery used throughout.  Its a great way to streatch out the kinks and get ready to face the work day.,1154649600,,229,4.088888888888889
8066289,4,B0009SQNOU,"I bought this video to learn how to bellydance with and found it very enlightening. I loved the spiritual descriptions of each movement, however, did not learn ""how"" to move as well from this video as I did from others (Jillians video was the other one I ordered) I think that this is a good video to learn the 'spirit' of the dance with, but not necessarily the movements. I would recommend buying this along with another video, that may not teach the 'spirit' but just the basic moves. I also found the women to be a little strange, but with good hearts.",1152662400,2,556,4.407766990291262
8066290,5,B0009SQNOU,I loved the spiritual connection of the dance to the Goddess rather than learning to perform.  Each section is proken down so a non-dance nonfit person can easily follow.
