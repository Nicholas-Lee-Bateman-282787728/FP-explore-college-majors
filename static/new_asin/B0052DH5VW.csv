8453794,5,B0052DH5VW,"I watched the first few series on American TV years ago and greatly enjoyed it, but then it was yanked.  I was thrilled to find out it had been produced for more years than I had seen. I finally got around to purchasing the boxed set and I'm glad that I did.  If you love British crime shows as much as I do, if you haven't already, purchase a region-free DVD player so you can enjoy a wide range of shows. The Brits do crime shows so much better than the Americans so.

Trevor Eve's character is rather a bear and hard to be around, but that's the character and he plays it so well.  So much so that at times you just want to yell at him to shut up.  Fortunately the other characters in the show off-set his and they all play off each other so well.

I'm taking my time watching the series so I can string out my enjoyment of it.",1475107200,,830,4.0
8453795,5,B0052DH5VW,"A real classic.  46 discs; one episode per disc; each episode just under two hours in length.  This is the British CSI, except that its better acted, better written and generally a bit darker, both in look and in the level of grit.  The cast changes a bit over the course of the nine seasons, but each incarnation of the ensemble is rock solid.  Detective Superintendent Peter Boyd, who leads the team, is played by Trevor Eve.  Sue Johnston plays the team psychologist and after the first several seasons Tara Fitzgerald joins as the principal forensics expert.

Given the proliferation of CSI versions in the U.S. (as well as the CSI imitators), this will come as a very pleasant discovery for many American viewers.  Boyds team is the cold case squad par excellence.  Set in the darker corners of London, the teams squad room is subterranean, with an inner sanctum encircled by plastic sheets for the body work.  This is serious drama but also serious entertainment.  Highly recommended.",1423526400,,990,4.839285714285714

8453798,5,B0052DH5VW,"I have been watching this series in the past few weeks and love it. It is Criminal Minds, Bones and CSI all wrapped up in a very NICE British way! The characters are real, the plots are convoluted enough to keep you guessing; and it is all done while having a pint or a cup of tea. I love the fact that I don't know who these actors are and have no preconceived ideas of them in other shows. I also am enjoying learning a bit about Britain as I watch the shows.  I have truly enjoyed this series~~",1375488000,,497,4.02020202020202
