8019603,5,B00020E3JM,"Walter Cronkite is not my favorite journalist.  He is greatly responsible for our defeat in Vietnam due to his misinterpretation of the Tet offensive.  Still, I am obligated to give him credit when it is richly deserved.  This particular program is of great value.  We learn about how TV impacted our nation's politics and especially in regards to the presidency of John F. Kennedy.  Who other than Cronkite had a front row seat during this era of American history?  He literally knew, on a professional basis, both JFK and Richard Nixon.  I never knew that Cronkite virtually manipulated Kennedy into taking TV seriously.  Kennedy agreed to an interview because Nixon had already eagerly accepted Cronkite's offer.  He was very uncomfortable the first time and even demanded a second take.  Needless to add, soon afterwards Kennedy realized that TV could help him achieve his goals.  He became a master of the medium.  You must see ""Television, Politics, and JFK.""  It is truly that important.",1201564800,2,994,5.024539877300613
8019604,5,B00020E3JM,Walter Cronkite Rembers the 20th Century is an excellent tape. It really reminded me of how much I miss hearing Walter's glorious voice on the news. Nobody discusses history or current events as he can.,1135296000,5,202,4.8
