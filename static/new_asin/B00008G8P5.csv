1846463,3,B00008G8P5,"It is amazing how the japanese do not improve the plot, the acting and the overall special effects to make a movie up to standards. Gamera 2 is better (in the FX department) than older versions, but still behind the times. Overall: MEDIOCRE.",1067731200,,241,4.627906976744186
1846464,4,B00008G8P5,"Most fans know this movie as Advent of Legion. At the time of this writing, Amazon.com is showing that title too, but the DVD is actually using the title Attack of Legion.
Since I prefer the subtitled version, I actually prefer how this DVD was made compared to the previous one. When I saw the preview on the first DVD, I was afraid they were going cover up some of the creativity used in the titles. I was surprised they left all of the Japanese titles in place - including some Japanese subtitles for the English spoken in the opening scene. The downside involves the English newscasts if you prefer subtitles. If you notice there are no Japanese subtitles for them. There is Japanese spoken over the English - with the English track's volume level reduced. There are no titles for this. You do have to struggle to hear the English for those parts only. You aren't missing much though. This concerns the Japanese audio only. If you listen to the English version, the newscasts were dubbed too, and there is no problem hearing these segments. When using the Japanese track with subtitles, this DVD is alot like my fansub but with the titles translated too.
Overall, the English voice acting is pretty good. Some good, some not as good. ADV seems to have decided to have a little fun with the English dub. By accident, I found a fairly bad joke near the 50:50 (minutes:second) mark in the English dub only. There are no subtitles for the Japanese spoken at that moment, but the joke's reference didn't exist in 1996 so this was definitely added for the dub even if the original Japanese had a similar meaning. It involves a man using a mobile phone during a chaotic moment. Subtitles aren't needed. That's the only added joke I've found so far.
The small Legions provide some nice bits of horror such as the subway scene near the beginning. It a little tame compared to some American films, but it's still good.
There are a few cheesy scenes like when a web site crashes, but the story itself is still nicely done. There is a little more humor than in the first movie. There were some debates between Godzilla and Gamera fans over how Legion was too similar to Destroyah (in concept). I understand the points, but I see too many differences to view this as a Destroyah [imitation]. (I'm a kaiju fan. Not simply Gamera or Godzilla.)
Most of the extras are nice. You have the second part of the Shinji Higuchi interview. There are also Japanese trailers and TV spots. I have mixed feelings over the ADV produced extras, but this isn't the first DVD to include material where the English voice actors have a little fun. The DVD of Legend of the Last Labyrinth (anime) also had something similar.
Among the ADV previews, there is a Gamera 3 preview. If you haven't been watching the Higuchi interview, here's a glimpse of why many of us have been commenting on the film.
I feel the new Gamera movies show what kaiju can have. ...what the genre can be. The filmmakers involved haven't limited themselves to what's worked in the past. The only traditional element that remains is having a man in a monster suit walking on a miniature set of a city. Even the monster suits appear to have more detail than those in most other kaiju films. Here, they mixed some CGI into the process too. Gamera 3 uses even more CGI. I also feel the overall editing and photography represent something fresh when compared to the Godzilla movies of the early 1990s. (There were no Godzilla movies between 1995 and 1999. Gamera 2 was released in Japan in 1996.)
I highly recommend this movie to any kaiju fan, and some non-fans might enjoy it too.",1051747200,4,3620,4.5793528505392915
1846465,5,B00008G8P5,"And by that I'm not talking about the fact it's guys in rubber monster suits, because I always take the movies seriously. I'm referring to some of the more unique extras on this disc. ADV has some interesting ""Outtakes""... which are actually select scenes with alternate dubbing in areas. Such scenes are Gamera commenting on his accidental building smashing, and the last scene with several takes. Also included is an approx. 12 minute long alternately dubbed ""Lake Texarkana Gamera"" where a lot of the military scenes have been taken and made into a short where most of the voices make the characters sound like hillbillies. Very funny. On to the rest of the disc, plenty of other extras which prove to be quite interesting. The movie itself keeps all the Japanese text for the title, credits, etc. unlike ADV's last release. Let's hope G3 meets or goes beyond the quality of this DVD.",1051315200,2,887,4.803921568627451
1846466,5,B00008G8P5,"If you think this is the best, wait for Gamera3, that movie has some of the best cg I've ever seen in this type of movie, with a compelling story too. It's terrific that Gamera2 is finally coming out in America, I knew there was a reason I didn't buy the bootleg on ebay. The great thing about Gamera (besides the excellent effects) is that it's a monster movie that you can take seriously, it doesn't go for the cheap and cheesy thrills like most of the Godzilla films, but wraps up the impressive action in a compelling story. This is definitely one of the most fun movies I've seen, and thank god it comes with a Japanese language track on the dvd.",1050019200,2,651,4.300813008130081

Like all other films in this genre including Godzilla, the insistence on using rubber suits and model miniatures limits the believability and increases the campiness.
But if you want to experience the pinnacle of kaiju, you have to wait for Gamera 3, Revenge of Iris.  It is, by far, the best giant monster movie made.",1048636800,,488,4.785714285714286

The script is tight, the direction is keen, the pace is fast, and the special effects are so convincing you WILL believe a giant turtle can fly.  This time Gamera battles a horde of alien insects infesting cities and, in one memorable scene, blowing one of those cities up.  This is the first ever release of this film in the U.S. (I've seen the Japanese release) and it's about time.  The DVD comes with both a Japanese language track and an English dubbed track.  I haven't seen the English dubbed, but I always recommend watching it in Japanese with the English subtitles.  A lot can get lost in translation.  For a good sci-fi romp that everyone in the family can enjoy (although really small children might be frightened by some scenes), it really doesn't get better than this.",1045699200,6,840,4.635135135135135
1846500,5,B00008G8P5,"Best scenes:

1. Gamera's return to life in the ruins of a destroyed city, maybe thanks to the prayers of children
2. The lead character's ""What a waste..."" when she sees the destruction in a brewery
3. The interview of the security guard in the brewery
4. The cellphone switching station engineer's dilemma over noodles

In Japan, Shusuke Kaneko's three Gamera films were grouped as the ""Heisei Gamera"" films after the ""era"" in which they were made. The original Gamera movies were from the Showa era (Showa emperor's reign), the new trilogy (I don't count the last Baby Gamera film) is from Heisei (the current emperor's reign). ""Legion"" is the best of the three.

Not surprising. Director Shusuke Kaneko watched monster movies when they were new and he was a kid. He knew what he wanted to see as an adult. He was a brilliant choice to revive not just Gamera, but the whole genre. His combination of special costume/model effects and digital animation is impeccable, and he finally gives monster movies great stories. (Apologies to Godzilla fans, but the Godzilla producers only got it marginally right in ""Final Wars,"" too late to revive the brand.)

I have the Japanese boxed set and have watched Legion so many times that I just jump to favorite scenes now. If you are a hardcore Japanese monster movie fan, I can't recommend the Heisei Gamera trilogy, and especially ""Legion,"" more.",1255737600,,1389,4.848101265822785

1846503,4,B00008G8P5,"I have loved Godzilla and the like since I saw my 1st Godzilla movie at a drive in when I was in 2nd grade (Godzilla vs Megalon; and I still love that drop kick!). My 4 yo son loves Godzilla movies and I'm very proud of the fact that he has latched on to Godzilla instead of the big purple money machine that is pushed off on so many kids.

When I found out about Gamera recently I started ordering some of the movies from Amazon w/o having seen them before. I bought the mid 90's Gamera trilogy as part of this new ""influence"" for my little boy. I try to screen this stuff before he watches it and turns out he's gonna need more body hair before he sees this one.

However; my review title refers to the 2nd English audio track that's on the DVD. After looking through the posted reviews I only saw one other note mentioning the ""hillbilly"" audiotrack and that review listed it as an extra. I stumbled onto this audio track and absolutely laughed like a crazed, white faced, purple suited villan!!!

There is a harmonica used for the incidental music, there's the same voice that keeps shouting out in times of chaos ""HOLY CRAP"", there's the pseudo-Clinton army guy, and enough toilet humor to make Matt Stone and Trey Parker proud.

As other reviews have noted, the movie is good for what it is, but watching it with the ""hillbilly"" audio track puts this movie in a class all it's own; and you gotta see & hear this stuff!!! For a 36yo guy that lives within 5 mi of the Appy Trail, I'm lucky enough to hear this verbal masacre of the language all the time. And yes many of the people that live in this area talk just like these guys (myself included).

Get the movie & laugh 'til it hurts!!!",1138665600,4,1693,4.294670846394984

1846505,5,B00008G8P5,"I love Godzilla, but Gamera has rapidly moved to a challenging position for the kaiju throne.  First, there was ""Gamera:  Guardian of the Universe"".  A terrific film full of amazing special effects, a cool story, and some slambang, knockdown, city smashing monster action.

And now, there's this film.  It meets and exceeds G:GATU in every respect.  The story is interesting.  The monsters are fun.  And the special effects rock.  The most interesting aspect of the film is how humanity must put aside its fear of Gamera to work alongside the titanic turtle to save the earth from deadly aliens.

Gamera has huge heroic presence.  I know that's odd to say about a guy in a rubber suit, but damnit, I stick to it.  When I see that turtle soaring through the air I just want to cheer.  And the Legion are some scary looking alien bugs, especially the formidable master kaiju of the swarm.

An exceptional film, top-to-bottom.",1132358400,3,923,4.7594936708860756
1846506,5,B00008G8P5,"In a sentence: A rollercoaster of a kaiju movie, absolutely bursting at the seams with intense action, likable characters, and a convincing story, Attack of Legion is easily in the same ballpark as the genre's finest.

The middle child of the Heisei Gamera trilogy, Attack of Legion proves itself to be more than worthy of the greatness of the other films. In fact, Attack of Legion is perhaps the single best film in this critically-acclaimed series, and perhaps one of the best kaiju films ever created. While the premise of the story is quite basic, its complications are quite interesting and it is supported by solid characters. In addition to this solid story, Attack of Legion has bar-none the finest effects in any kaiju movie yet seen in America (Except perhaps Gamera 3), which is saying a lot considering its age (Nearly 9 years). Yes, it even rivals and exceeds the visual flair of Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. which was released earlier last year.

The title, Attack of Legion, is all too appropriete given the film's subject matter. It's an undeniably simple story, revolving around a violent alien species transported to Earth via massive missle-launching flowers. They're here and they want to take over, dagnabbit. Its the way that the story is told that makes it so interesting: it has some believable scientific roots, and it takes itself seriously enough as to allow a very strong suspension of disbelief. Never once does it bite off more than it can chew, however, which is a very good thing and perhaps one of the largest flaws many films in the genre have. In any case, it's leaps above Gamera: Guardian of the Universe's story.

Attack of Legion takes a decidedly darker approach to presentation than most kaiju movies. It never once plays down to children, especially in terms of violence. Perhaps this single fact is what makes this movie so unique and awesome: It's not afraid to throw a little suspense-horror in there, particularly in one surprisingly effective sequence where the Legion monsters attack a train. Innocent people not only die, but the train conductor is absolutely splattered across a window, and yes, it leaves a lot of blood. This happens relatively early in the movie, and it absolutely sold me. Finally there would be a truly mature kaiju movie. Finally there would be a movie that wouldn't be looked down upon by non-kaiju fans. Finally there would be a series that could very well surpass Godzilla's legacy. The train conducter isn't the only one that bleeds either: Gamera sheds a very large amount of blood all over a building during a very well done escaping sequence. Okay, I like blood a little too much.

The monster designs live up elegantly to the high standards set by every other facet of the movie. The Legion monsters match their insectoid alien personalities with utmost perfection, and the final large Legion is a very unique and powerful looking monster. Surprisingly, the creatures (Save for Gamera, ironically the lowest-quality of the monsters) don't even look very fake in their numerous sequences. In fact, they would look incredibly lifelike if only they moved a little more than their rigid bodies seem to allow. Gamera, while clearly more kinetically-able than Godzilla, looks quite a bit worse in comparison to his opposition, which is a shame because he is the film's hero. Even so, his movements are entertaining and he's a flying turtle that launches fireballs, so it's hard to stay mad at him.

The monsters would perhaps not look so good if not for some very well-done camera work. The director clearly knows what he's working with, and he pulls it off with utmost mastery. There are several shots that stand out in my mind as unique and very effective, complimenting the monsters at every angle. For instance, there is a sequence in the movie where the Legion minions attack a Kirin beer warehouse in order to eat precious, precious glass, and two bumbling security guards encounter them. You see the monsters only twice in this whole scene: once only in shadow, and again through the boxes of Kirin beer. It sounds very simple, and it is in esscence, but it lends a large amount of believability whereas a less-skilled director would perhaps shoot the monsters head-on. The same goes for the train sequence: You see very little of the actual Legion monsters in this particular instance (But don't worry - you see them in massive quantity later on), yet this lends an incredible amount of suspense. Not all of his shots are so simply-effective, however. There are a significant amount of artistic shots that lend a certain grace of beauty to Gamera, such as when he is engulfed in the massive flower's blast. Such delicious little perks that the kaiju genre disregards in all too many cases. I also must tip my hat to the director in regards to his risky though utterly amazing balance of CG techniques and old school model techniques. Brilliant!

These visuals are often used to support the film's subtler values. There is quite a bit of Christian symbolism, and Gamera is even conveyed as a Christ-figure. Many would perhaps be turned off by the Lord being symbolized in a giant, alien-crushing turtle, but that's exactly makes kaiju cinema so brilliant: they're good movies. Gamera is by far more of a character than any Keanu Reeves character ever, yet people dismiss kaiju eiga at first glance. Despite this powerful symbolism, the movie acknowledges that its emphasis is more on action, and it never runs away with itself ala The Matrix Revolutions. The messages and symbols are gentle up until the movie's final minute in which two main characters have a brief exchange in dialogue that's the kaiju eiga trademark, ""Don't mess with nature."" Okay, we've all heard it a million times, but this message actually goes quite a ways to evolve the Gamera character from the good to the conditionally-good, a wise move on the creator's part.

What more is there to say? Gamera 2: The Attack of Legion needs to be seen. It's perfect for entry-level kaiju fans, as it is loaded with fun action sequences, but it also goes quite a bit deeper. Not quite as deep as something such as Godzilla vs. Mothra, but the difference is that Attack of Legion is simply a good time. Think of it as a poetry slam. There's loud noises, good characters, and you can read into things if you want, though it's hardly required. Attack of Legion is easily amongst the top 5 kaiju eiga ever created.",1125273600,3,6449,4.836050724637682

7983839,5,B00008G8P5,"If you want a kaiju movie, ""Gamera 2: Attack of Legion"" is your ticket. It is also your ticket if you wish to see spectacular visuals and moving action.

The second of Daiei's Gamera trilogy is a fantastic feature for all of these reasons, and while I cannot say with any certainty that it is one of the best kaiju films ever made, it is definitely the best Gamera movies ever made. Other installments had done better or would improve on separate aspects, but as an all-around package that pays homage to the turtle monster's legacy while embracing technical innovation, this one is the total presentation.

The story: A meteorite brings a deadly race of insectoids called the Legion to Earth. When the life forms respond violently to human technology and threaten the planet's devastation, humanity's last hope lies in the returning Gamera to repel an innumerably immense threat.

The technical aspects of the film impress me more than anything, and they contribute to its great look. While&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guardian-of-the-Universe/dp/B0000844JH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guardian of the Universe</a>&nbsp;had some fairly unconvincing special effects and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revenge-of-Iris/dp/B00008G8Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revenge of Iris</a>&nbsp;would go overboard with CGI, ""Attack of Legion"" achieves an almost perfect balance of traditional effects and animated/computer-generated insertions. The Legion drones are cool and Gamera looks fantastic, but I was blown away by the ambitiousness of the Mother Legion's colossal form; I don't know how many puppeteers were stuffed into the costume to accommodate its sheer size and operate its many appendages, but the resulting sight of it can be breathtaking. The battles are filled with perfectly-integrated CG enhancements, creating a spectacular effect and making me think that this is the kind of kaiju film Guillermo del Toro would have made 20 years ago.

Gamera's heroic persona - established in the previous film - is elevated even further in ""Attack of Legion"". The biblical implication of the alien monsters is made thoroughly clear, and by fighting them on behalf of humanity, Gamera transcends heroism and becomes Christlike, (SPOILER) especially when you regard his impalement as an allusion to crucifixion and note his blatant death-and-resurrection. This representation may seem excessive, and certainly did so to Japan's sci-fi aficionados when the film won the 17th Japan Science-Fiction Grand Award, but I feel it accomplishes exactly what the filmmakers of the new trilogy were going for and makes Gamera infinitely more accessible to new fans. The modest amount of gore in the movie should not make it unpalatable to but the most prudent viewers, and thus, if you plan to watch only a single ""Gamera"" flick in your life, there's no reason why it should not be this one.

What makes my rating slightly less enthusiastic is the movie's boring initial half-hour, which highlights the more mundane human-driven segments and makes it clear that most of the budget has been poured into the creatures and explosions. Additionally, it's disappointing that the importance of Ayako Fujitani's returning character has been considerably reduced, resulting in a dearth of human personas that are more than moderately interesting. Luckily, this does not drastically diminish how interesting the movie is or how readily I recommend it. If you like giant monsters, this movie will almost certainly constitute a highlight for you.",1431388800,,4097,6.034364261168385

7983847,5,B00008G8P5,"Attack of Legion is one of the best non Godzilla Kaiju productions in a long time!  Sure, lots more people are familiar with the Big, Bad (but always cool!)King of all Monsters, but Gamera holds its own!  It does it on a different level however.  While Gamera's demonstrated powers and abilities, (Suborbital Flight, Vertical Takeoff, Plasma Fireballs, Regeneration, and considerable intelligence) are formidable, the director did not try to engender a comparison with Godzilla's almost invincible abilities, tremendous size and strength, or near total invulnerability to attacks.  Instead, the viewer is treated to Gamera's heroic struggle to protect the humans from both the Legion and 'Legion Prime' for want of a better term.  Its obvious in the story that Gamera could not fight and win alone against both the Legion and their monstrous brother.  Humans had to become involved with the hero in the fight, and the resulting battles, and the strategy that drove the combatants, make for excellent viewing.  Legion Prime vs. Gamera had several intense matches, while Gamera vs. the Legion had good tactical confrontations.  Humans played a significant part in coming to understand and aid Gamera too, which does not happen frequently in the Godzilla universe.  (at least the understanding part) All in all, the special effects, monster combats, and excellent plot buildup make this a truly worthy addition to the Kaiju franchise.
