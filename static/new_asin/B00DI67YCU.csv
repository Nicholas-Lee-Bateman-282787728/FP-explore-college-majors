There is nothing shocking here that isn't edited, not to mention how dumb it is put together. I am disappointed I spent $5 on this and wasted 90 minutes. The preview will entice horror fans, but trust me this movie sucks. Its a B movie.",1388620800,,359,4.294117647058823

5818145,3,B00DI67YCU,"I didn't realize it was subtitled.  When the fronts blow in, I don't like subtitles because it is hard to read with one hand scratching and rubbing at your eye.  Aside from that it was an alright movie.  It is brutal but the pacing and acting wasn't bad and there is quite a bit of gore.  I would have liked it better if the director had spent less time on the prostitution job and spitting once she was done with her job but the viewer got idea of what was going on.  The story is about three siblings who run from their drug dealing father and end up in one unfavorable situation after another.  The gore does reflect the savage brutal story of the siblings as well as the rough characters and terrain the story takes place in.  There was a mild ""twist"" ending where the viewer finds out who the woman had an affair with (it begins with a man drowning a woman in the sink asking her who she was sleeping with) and there was a moderately happy ending for the siblings.",1383436800,3,969,4.233695652173913

The movie has horrible writing/dialogue, acting, pacing, setup, plot, etc..and pretty much everything you can imagine that can go wrong in a movie happens in Hidden in The Woods.

5818147,4,B00DI67YCU,"*I received a review copy of this film; this is an unbiased review.

Part horror, part thriller, and part family drama, HIDDEN IN THE WOODS is one of those multi-genre hybrids that breaks molds and knocks down cultural barriers.  But to do so, it assails its viewers with a large does of brutality and gore.  This is certainly not a bad thing for a movie of this caliber, but what makes this more shocking than most horror flicks is that this is based on a bizarre but true story.  This film is relentless in its intensity and violence, but if you can make it through, you're in for a real treat.

HIDDEN IN THE WOODS is shot well and looks very good onscreen.  But two primary components made this movie for me:  the acting and the special effects (specifically, the gore).

The cast in this film is amazing.  Siboney Lo and Carolina Escobar are the two lead actresses and they do a spectacular job of conveying the agonies their characters went through in real life.  The audience relates to them very early on, and therefore feels a part of every tragedy inflicted upon them.

Likewise, the gore in HIDDEN IN THE WOODS looks exceptional.  And there's plenty of it, too.  When the father goes after the two police officers with a chainsaw, I saw flashbacks to THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.  And the climactic ending is reminiscent of a Quentin Tarantino film, with a crazy kitchen shootout that would make the man himself proud.

HIDDEN IN THE WOODS is a difficult film to watch in certain places because of its graphic and sensitive subject matter.  But it is a hell of a film and one I highly recommend if you can stomach through it.  Just be warned:  this one will not be for everyone.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1382313600,3,1741,4.50479233226837
5818148,5,B00DI67YCU,"I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of this DVD for review.  This review may contain some spoilers.  Here it is:

Hidden in the Woods is a film that is based on true events, though this is extremely hard to believe given the gruesome content and nature of the film throughout.  Within the interview that is included in the 8-page collectible booklet, the director claims the film is 70% accurate to the true events and the other 30% is his own vision.  Regardless, Hidden in the Woods will keep you at the edge of your seat for the whole 98 minute run time and leave the story and some images burned in your mind forever.

The movie follows a couple of sisters and their brother who had escaped from their father, Felipe, who was a drug dealer.  Throughout the years, Felipe had abused the girls and brother and subjected them to monstrous atrocities that you only read about in books.  Their brother, Manuel, is deformed and had only been fed an all meat diet while he was locked in a shed.  After escaping from their father, the girls and their brother all go to a cabin deep within the woods where Felipe used to keep his drugs.  It is in this cabin the viewer is treated to a scene where the family cannibalizes a couple of hikers, who were up to no good, after they tried to attack one of the women.  We see dismemberment, blood, gore, guts, and just about everything you can imagine.  The special effects in this part of the film were very well done and made the scene seen believable.

A man named, Costello, is the leader of a drug gang and he wants Felipe's drugs, so he decides to get other members of his gang to find the girls and torture them until they reveal where the drugs are hidden.  Some members of the drug gang finally find the cabin with the girls in it and start to torture them asking where the drugs are; however, they have no clue.  After some more blood flies, the girls and Manuel manage to escape into the woods.  The remaining two members of the drug gang go out to find them and kill them.  This chase sequence is very well done and so intense, it had the palms of my hands sweating and hoping the girls would get away.  Eventually, we are brought to the very final scene of the movie.  The final scene is so disturbing and so bloody, at times, I had to look away.  I kept telling myself, ""It's only special effects."", but it was so well done, it almost seemed like reality.

I don't want to reveal too much of this movie in this review, hence, why I'm a bit vague on a few things because there are a couple of twists in the story at the end.  Overall, this movie was sick, disgusting, gory, and extremely bloody, but I liked it.  It was very well done and the story line was very believable, obviously, because it was mostly true.  Hidden in the Woods is a movie that I recommend almost any Horror fan to watch as it's a story of survival and revenge at its most extreme.  Overall, I give Hidden in the Woods a 5/5 stars.  It's definitely worth buying and keeping in your collection as you may want to watch it multiple times.

Overall rating:  5/5 stars

5818152,5,B00DI67YCU,"This is one of those reviews where I'm sort of leaving it to better reviewers than I (with which Amazon if rife) to fill you in on the basic plot while I make a more specific case that puts it in a context that you might call political, sociopolitical or, as some of my friends would be quick to chide me, merely pretentious and overly intellectualized: namely, I'm going to try to put this movie into context with what I know about world history and then try to argue that in many ways this is the purest and rawest available version of one of the stories you see again and again in the horror genre, from Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Twin Peaks, a story of dark, ugly, angry depravity rising up from the countryside and punishing the people of the city with a sort of dark vengeance.

From here out a couple spoilers do follow. One's not such a big deal, but the other one's a whopper.

Early on in this movie, two Chilean cops driving into the deep dark woods discuss the domestic abuse case they are about to address. The one driving, a heavyset man with greying hair, says (in the English translation) ""These rednecks are so ignorant."" His partner, a petite and photogenic young woman, stands up for ""hillbillies"" in a politically correct way.

A few minutes later, they are being massacred with a chainsaw by a backwards sociopath widower involved in the illegal drug trade who periodically has made attempts to curb his incestuous relations with the two young women whom we are led to believe are his daughter (HERE'S THE ALERT FOR THE BIG SPOILER!!!!!! DON'T LOOK IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW THE MOVIE ENDS!!! I AM WARNING YOU, DON'T LOOK!!!!: one of them is, as it turns out, but one of them isn't).

I wish my Spanish were better so that I could know what words were the basis for the translation into the two words, ""hillbilly"" and ""redneck"" which, as far as my research can tell, are both unique to  US American English. Back the day my public school's woeful deficiencies combined with my poor planning made it so that, in order to graduate, I had to take a semester of history at the local community college. My teacher was a ruddy faced Irish American and a natural storyteller, as all history teachers ought to be, and the course was called History of Western Civilization. He was quick to point out that just using the word civilization to denote anything positive is a political statement of solidarity in an ongoing struggle older than history itself between those who support themselves by agriculture and those who live in cities. He pointed out that every culture has its own set of derogatory terms for country dwellers that indicate a lack of sophistication, whereas there really is no equivalent to express contempt for city dwellers. One student suggested ""city slickers"" might count, but even as she uttered it the whole class could feel that if anything the term was one that contained a lot of righteous anger, but at the same time the jealousy of history's perpetual losers against history's perpetual winners.

This does reflect, at least in my mind, on any innate difference between people born inside or outside of cities but rather from the fact that, in order to survive, cities need to get food from the countryside. In order for rural communities to survive, cities are really not needed for diddly squat. And yet our entire world history is really a story of people in cities taking advantage of the hard work of those who support them. The worst insult of all is that urban institutions such as universities, newspapers and other arbiters of language have seen to it that the best traits of humankind, which have been with us since we were hunters and gatherers, have been grouped together under the heading ""civilized,"" as though virtues such as patience, intelligence and strength of character were somehow invented in cities.

What wonder can there be, then, in the fact that so many of our horror movies are about ugly forces that have been long hidden in the woods and that suddenly rear up to attack all too cavalier in their sense of safety and superiority. In this movie, titled ""Hidden in the Woods"" for its English language release but originally called ""En las afueras de ciudad""roughly translated, ""on the outskirts of the city"" or ""outside the city"" this almost universal story is boiled down to one of its rawest and most brutal manifestations.

Thanks largely to its release by the wonderful Artsploitation label, there has been enough popular cult demand that this film has had a remake set in the United States. It's ironic because in a sense the woods doesn't exist in America anymore. Oh, sure, we have lots of trees, and lots of rural areas with tourism bureaus geared to attract well-heeled tourists from the big cities on the coasts and around the Great Lakes, but has anyone else noticed how about 80% of modern American horror movies have to establish in the same clumsy way that there is ""no cell phone reception"" before anything legitimately bad can happen. The new adaptation appears to have been released sometime in 2014 but doesn't seem to be available at the time I write this review; I think any fan of the original HIW who saw the way the amazing Mexican cannibal horror ""We Are What We Are"" got mutated into a totally different (albeit pretty good) movie in its US adaptation has a right to feel very adaptation. Still, the news that brilliant director Patricio Marcelo Valladares made the adaptation to has at least one critic on the edge of his seat.",1397174400,4,5525,4.6828012358393405
5818153,2,B00DI67YCU,"This movie was so gory and had very disturbing content.  I'm not crazy about foreign movies, but it was easy to follow, the story line was pretty dumb, but it if you like gory slasher films, this is for you.",1396396800,,207,4.175
5818154,2,B00DI67YCU,"Another dime-a-dozen woodsian horror garlic belch. Nudity... check. Blood... check. Screaming and running... check Any good... Nah. Though American remake rights have been obtained, I find it hard to fathom why. Acting... crappy. Special effects... just as crappy. This kind of cinema DOES have its merits though idiots and some haughty-taughty groups have manage to pin the trite ""torture porn"" label on the genre. This is the kind of film that lends merits to the claim, not because it's loaded with with checklist content, but because it's just poorly made (and not in a good way only lovers of this can of cinema appreciate).",1396051200,2,629,5.0576923076923075
5818155,2,B00DI67YCU,"this movie could have been much better.  you lost me at the ""flesh-eating"" stage.  it seems any filmmaker can make a buck with a cannibal, zombie or vampire theme.  i should make one, and retire.  thanks for a giant waste of time.",1395273600,,230,4.404761904761905

5818157,5,B00DI67YCU,"Well first off you must enjoy foreign films before watching this since there are subtitles to follow and I understand some people can't watch movies with subtitles because they are too lazy to ready or whatnot. Anyways, this movie is pretty messed up since the story follows a horrible drug dealer father that drinks and rapes his own daughters in some dirty house in the woods but if you are a thriller / horror fan and also enjoy scenes that can be hard to watch by the average hollywood movie watcher then you need to check this film out! This is one of those films that you end up watching once and possibly can't watch again due to how sick the movie can be sometimes but that does not mean I regret watching it because I am glad I saw this despite some negative reviews from movie watchers that prefer transformers or some ghost movie. Anyways, go ahead and rent this flick to see if you can handle the first 15-20 minutes because if you do, then you can finish the whole movie! So glad I rented this because I never heard anything about this film until the other day by watching the trailer on amazon and rented it as soon as I realized it was a foreign film since horror / thriller foreign films have been on a roll lately for these past several years. Also, I have to give MAJOR props to Siboney Lo and Carolina Escobar for putting on an amazing performance while doing many crazy things throughout the film since this film is not for everyone.  If you have seen the classic foreign film, ""Martyrs"" and you could handle that type of movie then you can handle ""Hidden in the Woods"" aka ""En las afueras de la ciudad""",1394236800,2,1623,4.374172185430464
5818158,4,B00DI67YCU,"Hmmm. I hope it doesn't happen often, as I only stumbled upon a few deletions by accident. Oh well.
This movie doesn't fall neatly in the horror genre. Its more horrifying. than entertaining, one of those in which you feel you need a shower after watching. The acting and setting makes it seem oh so realistic. As if I were peeping in on a 'family'. There is child abuse, incest, drug trafficking, lots of violence... in a backwoods, Latin American setting. There's a horror subgenre theme here but I won't reveal it though others probably have. When I watched this there were only 2 reviews and it wasn't mentioned so it came as a surprise, as it should. This movie is a great exercise in relativism. Toward the middle, I was increasingly repelled by the protagonists, and thought ""They need to die"". But then, with the insertion of the drug cartel guys, I started rooting for them! Anyway, it you like dark, ugly movies, and have no objection to subtitles if you don't speak Spanish, then this one is very well done.",1392249600,3,1018,4.5989010989010985
