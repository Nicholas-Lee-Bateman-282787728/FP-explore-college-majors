2386305,4,B000ADWDIO,"America is a great country, ain't it, Doc? Where else do people pay a full price premium on a product that they really only want 25% of?

Alright, alright...perhaps dat ain't fair. Daffy, Porky and the rest of the gang have their moments. And some of the lesser known classics that feature none of the popular characters are ""nice to have"", but ain't ""need to have"".

But the Bugs Bunny shorts in this collection make it woith the dough and woith the 4 star rating. HIT THE BUY BUTTON, for sure, Doc.

It sure would be nice to be giving 5 stars to an all Bugs Bunny collection though. I mean why couldn't they sell the individual character collections separately. Rhetorical question, really. The answer is good old American capitalism. And us maroons keep buyin' 'em, so no point in complaining anymore.

If they release one collection on its own it should be the ""banned"" collection. This way those who might be offended don't have to purchase it. Here's the list of what us collectors would like to see, so please Mr. Warner, let us see 'em again:

Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt - Featuring a stereotypical Elmer Fudd trying to catch Bugs.

Bunker Hill Bunny - Bug's says, ""Your brother blows bubble gum.""

All This and Rabbit Stew - The only Bugs cartoon on the Censored Eleven, featuring a stereotype trying to catch Bugs.

Southern Fried Rabbit - Yosemite Sam is a Confederate with Bug's trying to cross the Mason/Dixon line as a stereotype.

Any Bonds Today? - Bugs Bunny and friends promote war bonds, with Bugs doing a Jolson impression.

Fresh Hare - A firing squad that turns ""into a stereotype"" at the end to sing along to Bugs' last wish of being in Dixie. Elmer and Bugs jump into snow drifts leaving silhouettes...one of Bug's silhouettes is a shapely woman.

Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips - One of the most infamous Bugs Bunny cartoons, with Bugs fighting stereotypes during World War II.

Herr Meets Hare - Bugs disguises himself as Hitler in the Black Forest.

Mississippi Hare - Cotton pickers mistake Bugs' tail for a ball of cotton and toss him in with the rest of the haul. On the riverboat Bugs takes on the gambler Colonel Shuffle.

Which is Witch? - A stereotypical witch doctor needs Bugs as an ingredient.

Bushy Hare - Featuring the stereotypical Aborigine ""Nature Boy"",...""UNGA BUNGA BUNGA INGA BINGA BINGA BUNGA!!!! What'd I say?! What'd I say?!""

Horse Hare - Yosemite Sam leads a Indian stereotypes to invade Bugs' fort.

A Feather In His Hare - Another American Indian stereotype trying to catch Bugs.",1148342400,6,2522,4.695454545454545
2386306,5,B000ADWDIO,"If you like the real Looney Tunes then you need these collections - ALL of them.  Don't order just one as it is like having 1 chip, cant do it.

I watch them with my family and they are by far THE best cartoons my kids have seen.  They love them and have several favorites they can act out without the dvd playing!  Beats any cartoon material produced since - including those awful Tiny-Toon disasters.

Some real hidden gems - Private Snafu (never seen that stuff).

Can watch the characters change over time - Elmer, Bugs, Daffy, Tweety all go through some growing up.  Very neat to see.

2386311,3,B000ADWDIO,"Almost $180.00. Are you that loony to pay that much considering how many loony-tunes shorts this set is missing? I purchased this thinking: ""I now own all the loony-tunes I could ever dream of."" WRONG! How do I know this? Allow me to explain myself.

I own, on VHS, ""The Neverending Story II: The Next Chapter."" That movie, of course, has nothing to do with this set except that, before the flick, there is a loony-tune short with Bugs Bunny, Daffy D. Duck, and Elmer Fudd. I forgot the name of the short, however it stars Bugs Bunny having a movie theatre put over his home (a rabbit hole no less). Daffy is a movie goer and Elmer is an usher who tries to get both Bugs and Daffy out of the theater. Bugs finally manages to put Daffy and Elmer into a movie with a chainsaw killer (like that seen in ""The Chainsaw Massacre"") and says, ""It takes a miracle to get into pictures, and now these two jokers want to get out."" I have seen this short many times, because I have watched ""The Neverending Story II: The Next Chapter"" many times. So, are you loony enough to purchase this? Unless you are a die-hard Loony-Tunes fanatic like myself or have a young one who needs this, purchase them one at a time or go rent one. Trust me, you will use your money wisely because you too will notice that some are missing.

Also, many loony-tunes characters are barely even featured. Foghorn Leghorn, for example, I have yet to find. I found one, and only one, Tasmanian Devil cartoon. Pepe Le Pew has a few, really. Maybe he stinks too much! Speedy Gonzalas is missing quite a few. What I am trying to say is that these focus on Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, and then those rare to find Loony-Tunes in that order. The next paragraph will let you know what is on each disc in order.

2386312,4,B000ADWDIO,"These days, animation has really came a long way to what we have with films like Madagascar, Shrek, and Toy Story. Nevertheless, you sometimes do quite often overshadow those classics. Whether it was MGM, or Disney who have really shined with greats, they've put them back to the video shelves, as well for the cornerstone of Warner Brothers, Looney Tunes. Since so many have considered these greats from Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and company to be the milestones of animation today. That has came out again and again with revivals in movies, and television shows. The recent revival, a spinoff of these greats within the new series, Loonatics. But, while these new versions spin to youngsters, the classic can never die.

The Looney Tunes Golden Collections Volumes 1-3 is a compilation of about 180 of the greatest Warner Brothers animated shorts to ever be placed onto the DVD. The collection consists of animated classics from toons like What's Opera Doc?, Duck Amuck, For Scent-imental Reasons with Pepe Le Pew, and underappreciated gems like The Mouse That Jack Built, a spinoff from the Jack Benny television show, and other greats. Most of the episodes have been remastered perfectionally, while certain shorts like The Rabbit Of Seville was visually fixed up well, the audio was not in the original perfected tone it was released on video numerous times. Unlike most DVD animated reflections like Ren & Stimpy or Spongebob Squarepants, these looney classics are uncut and still full of life.

Nevertheless, it is still a shame many people in this generation doesn't appreciate these great classics that have defined the world of animation. The Loonet tunes Golden Collection Volumes 1-3 is a great buy for any die hard fan of these gems, or for anybody in this generation who hasn't seen these wonderful looney shorts. That's All Folks!

2386347,5,B000ADWDIO,"The Looney Tunes - Golden Collections are truly massive compilations of glorious Saturday morning entertainment.  I find that many of the cartoons on the air today are crudely drawn, poorly written, and overly politically correct.  When I found out that Looney Tunes were available on DVD, I jumped at the chance to purchase them, and I wasn't disappointed.  Each Volume contains 4 DVDs, and each DVD has a certain theme.  For example, in Volume 1, Disk 1 is entitled ""Best of Bugs Bunny,"" Disk 2 is ""Best of Daffy and Porky,"" etc.  The menu interface is simple, and features a ""Play all"" command, so you don't have to go back and select a new cartoon short every few minutes.  The cartoons featured are not just the ""classic"" Looney Tunes, either.  There are selections from the very beginning of Looney Tunes, such as ""Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur"" (Volume 3, Disk 4).  Not all of the cartoons feature the identifiable and loveable characters, either.  There are also DVDs featuring the Hollywood Caricatures and Parodies created, providing a slightly more intelligent break from the zany antics of Bugs, Daffy, Porky, and friends.  The DVDs are also LOADED with special features and commentary.  There is enough here to keep a die-hard Looney Tunes fan entertained for a very long time.  In my opinion, this collection is well worth the money.",1167782400,3,1345,4.8766519823788546

2386349,5,B000ADWDIO,"The Looney Tunes cartoons span over 30 years from 1930 until the end of the WB animation studio in 1963, and these three volumes do a good job of representing the best that WB animation had to offer during this time. Watching these old cartoons makes it painfully obvious how much less original today's cartoons look when compared to these classics, even as the cost of animation production has radically declined due to improved technology. The Looney Tunes brought out the kid in everyone, where today's cartoons are mainly animated versions of adult characters in some kind of sci-fi action adventure with some high-tech weaponry thrown in for good measure.

These three volumes do a fine job of spanning the three decades of Looney Tunes. Volume one concentrates more on the golden era of Looney Tunes,  which was from approximately 1948-1953 and contains a large sampling of Bugs Bunny including the classic ""Duck! Rabbit! Duck!"", where you get to clearly see the pecking order of Bugs, Daffy, and Elmer Fudd that holds constant throughout any cartoons involving any combination of those three. Volume Two includes some of the older cartoons, among them, ""Sinkin' in the Bathtub"" (1930), the first Looney Tune, and the Oscar-winning documentary ""So Much for So Little."" Also there's one of my favorites ""I Love to Singa"", which was a 1936 cartoon that was a take-off on ""The Jazz Singer"". Everyone will recognize 1955's ""One Froggy Evening"" in which a workman discovers a frog that only sings when the two of them are alone. This features the frog with the tophat that was the mascot for the WB network. Volume Two is also heavily weighted towards the Road Runner and Tweety. Volume Three has a wider range of cartoons than the first two volumes, with the original Porky Pig cartoon from 1935 through to some entries from 1963, the year of the last Looney Tune. Pepi Le Pew, Foghorn Leghorn, and Speedy Gonzales are also included in various cartoons over the three volumes.

Apparently there were some earlier complaints about the price that have been resolved, since the price for the three sets together is now pretty much on par with collecting the three volumes separately. There is a fourth volume available, but currently it must be bought separately. If you have fond memories of watching these cartoons on TV as a kid, I highly recommend this set.",1167350400,2,2360,4.8802992518703245

I grew up loving Looney Tunes, especially Bugs and wanted to share them with my daughter who is nine.  She loves watching Looney Tunes and seems to prefer them over the cartoons that are on currently on TV.",1159142400,8,461,4.585365853658536

Classic is a very overused term these days, but these wonderful old cartoons exemplify classic in every way, from the wonderful animation, instantly recognized sound effects, truly funny story lines, and (possibly most of all) the voice of the legendary, late and very great Mel Blanc.
