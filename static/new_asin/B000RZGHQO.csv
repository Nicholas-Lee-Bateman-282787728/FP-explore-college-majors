8203260,2,B000RZGHQO,"The sound on this DVD is Dolby Digital 2.0. The compression is severe and strips the audio of any real musicality. If you jack up the sound level and use artificial reverb you can tweak something out of this, but that is just voodoo audio, and not the real thing.
In every other respect I agree with the previous reviewer about this performance, but there are other DVDs out there with better sound mastering. A blu-ray of this title would be very nice to have, someday!",1344124800,4,470,4.476744186046512
8203261,4,B000RZGHQO,"I bought this DVD for my husband who loves Opera . In talking with him about the video this is more or less what he said. - I had never seen this particular opera on stage, however I found it very good in a few differen ways without getting to technical. The color is great. The camara work well done judging by other videos that I have in my collection and that are reputed to be great in that respec. THere is very beautiful traditional scenary and above all I discover , except for the tenor, Marcello Giordani, a group of actors and singers which , knowing the music by having listened to Caballe and Pavarotti recording to exhaustion did not disapoint me in the list. I particularly enjoyed the Voce di Donna by Lidia Tirandi.  I would not think twice about recommending it to any of my friends. I am sure that I will come back to watch this one over and over.
It is refreshing to view something that does not comes out of the Met Coven Garden or La Scalla.
I hope this Kicco CLassic puts out a few more DVD's on Amazone .
