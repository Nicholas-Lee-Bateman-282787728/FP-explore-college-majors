213602,4,6300151360,"Micheal Caine plays Frank Jones a decorated ex-British Navy veteran and now businessman.  His beloved son Bob played by Nigel Havers is a Russian linguist working for the British Secret Service before the days of detente.  He tells Caine that he suspects some strange things are happening in his agency, that he would like to expose.

The Secret Service suspicious of Havers has been bugging his conversations and ultimately liquidate him, covering up his death.  Caine, unsatisfied with the official declaration of an accidental death, commences his own investigation.

He eventually is lead to John Gielgud playing high ranking politician Sir Adrian Chapple who acting as a Russian mole, has been feeding them sensitive bits of intelligence for years.

With a distinctly British flavor, ""The Whistle Blower"" is an above average vintage Cold War drama that uses at it's conclusion the incredible pagaentry of a monarchy sponsored parade filmed in the streets of London.",1170460800,3,970,5.266233766233766

213604,5,6300151360,"Based on a novel by John Hale, this 1987 film is a cold war spy story with more twists and angles than can be absorbed in a single viewing.
The boundaries between right and wrong are blurred, in this complex plot where co-workers in the secret service are asked to spy on each other, truth-seekers are murdered, and the guilty are kept protected in their luxurious nests.
With an excellent cast that includes James Fox, Nigel Havers, John Gielgud, Felicity Dean, and many top-notch character actors, it's a fast paced hour and 40 minutes...one of my favorite parts is how they manage to get information out of the imprisoned double agent, making him believe that he has escaped.
Also adding a lot to the film is the lovely soundtrack by John Scott.
Michael Caine is powerful as the former spy and bereaved father, who investigates his son's death. Part vulnerable, part tough guy, it's a subtle, touching, and brilliant performance, and its believability makes this intricate thriller a 5 star film.",1019606400,20,999,4.847953216374269

213628,2,6300151360,"""The Whistle Blower ""(1987) (104  minutes) is an action/crime thriller, a rather  grim British film made rather late in what's turned out to be Oscar-winner Sir Michael Caine's long, long, and varied celluloid career. It fits nicely into the older guy vengeance/vigilante school, such as Clint Eastwood's GRAN TORINO: guess every aging action star gets to make one or two. (And, in fact, a later film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Brown/dp/B003T6LHWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Brown</a>, which I have also viewed and reviewed in these pages, strongly resembles it). The film is slow-moving, but cerebral and suspenseful, and boasts a strong cast backing Caine.  It's based on a novel by John Hale, with script by Julian Bond, directed by Simon Langton.

Caine, an Oscar winner for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cider-House-Rules-Miramax-Collector-s-Series/dp/B00003CWNR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cider House Rules (Miramax Collector's Series)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannah-and-Her-Sisters-Blu-ray/dp/B009UTX4M8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannah and Her Sisters [Blu-ray</a>], and the Batman movies, plays Frank Jones,  the title character -- the whistle blower--a distinguished  army veteran, only moderately successful businessman, and  recent widower. It is the midst of the cold war; Frank and his son are both involved to some degree in the spy business.  Frank finds himself trying to investigate the recent death of  his son Robert, ""Bob"" Jones, a Russian translator for a British intelligence agency.  Bob, as played by Nigel Havers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Loneliness-of-the-Long-Distance-Runner/dp/B000MQKPFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner</a>) has just died, as has another friend of his, in mysterious circumstances.

David Langton (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Upstairs-Downstairs-The-Complete-Series-40th-Anniversary-Collection/dp/B004H0ZHD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Upstairs, Downstairs: The Complete Series - 40th Anniversary Collection</a>) plays the relevant government minister overseeing the agency.  Felicity Dean (CONNECTIONS) plays Cynthia Goodburn, widow of Bob's murdered friend, and Bob's mistress.  Theater immortal Sir John Gielgud (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arthur-HD/dp/B008WE64H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arthur [HD</a>]) plays the distinguished Sir Adrian Chapple.

The movie was filmed, in color, to be sure, on location in London and environs, and seems to incorporate actual historical footage of the period.  It  appears that the plot is based on that of the highly-placed Sir Anthony Blunt, art advisor to Queen Elizabeth II, who was some time ago, revealed as the fifth man in the very damaging pro-Soviet spy network headed by Kim Philby and Anthony Burgess, and it treats the spy business in a fairly realistic manner.  Some of the casting was of more than passing interest.  Nigel Havers, from his debut in LONELINESS, until the present day, has specialized in playing upper-class twits, and I found him utterly unbelievable as Caine's son, particularly spliced between scenes of Foster, another certified cockney, and Caine tossing back a few . Felicity Dean might have been the blond of the week back then, who can remember, but her fleshy look hasn't aged well.  Gordon Jackson, whom I believe I first saw in a small part as an ethnic Scot in TIGHT LITTLE ISLAND, unfortunately committed suicide some years ago.  Sources close to him have said that he despaired of being typecast precisely as he was here.  And, oddly enough, there are three connections to the beloved TV serial UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS. Jackson was, of course, the butler, Mr. Hudson. David Langton, the government minister here,  Richard Bellamy, head of that household.  And director Simon Langton is his son.

There is, in this picture, the usual whiff of anti-Americanism  that was common in all the spy movies of the period influenced by the great British spymeister John  LeCarre, who was  writing of the Philby betrayal in his Karla  trilogy (,).  Mind you, Michael Caine gives an outstanding  performance in this entertainment, down to his original cockney walk.  And I've been crazy about Caine since first I clocked him in ZULU; then in the original ALFIE (1966), and for sure in THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,GET CARTER(1971)and his Harry Palmer trilogy.  It's too bad, but if you're not a particular fan of his, or of movies in the spy genre, I'm not sure this flick will do anything for you.",1361491200,,5389,6.673352435530086
213629,3,6300151360,"The British accents are at times a little tricky for this American, making intricate details harder to follow in the 1986 espionage thriller THE WHISTLE BLOWER but I think I get it anyway. As the closing credits roll see if you agree that all we need to understand happens in the opening scenes, where we get to know the worldly, skeptical former British naval officer Frank Jones and his idealistic young adult son Bob, who translates Russian for a Great Britain spy agency.  When Bob dies in an unexplained accident, we start to understand why Frank had seemed to be shaking his head about what his son had yet to learn.  Seeking the truth about how and why his son lost his life, Frank realizes there are some things he didn't know, either.

Michael Caine anchors THE WHISTLE BLOWER as Frank and even if a few of the accents and plot twists lose you, he won't.  Maybe young, innocent Bob Jones and the older, skeptical Frank Jones represent any or all of us, such common names perhaps a hint.  But unlike Bob, we could get to live long enough to question who the good guys really are, if they even exist, as Frank has.  See THE WHISTLE BLOWER.",1359590400,,1146,4.485576923076923

The movie begins with a parade in London. Next we see a man being tested with a polygraph (the so-called ""lie detector"" which only measures emotions). We see man in a subway fall under a train. (Was it a murder designed to look like an accident?) ""Taking the bait?"" Next we see a family gathering. Bob works at GCHQ, they are encouraged to spy on each other. [Unusual?] His father Frank recommends job security. Bob talks too much about his work listening to telephone conversations. [There were no cell phones in those days.] Later, Adam is found in his garage with the motor running? Another accident? We see how business is done via the old boy network (its who you know). A spy escapes from prison and goes into hiding. Is he safe? Or is there some trick? Frank Jones hears very bad news: his son Bob fell off a roof. A journalist from ""The Senator"" shows up (a left-wing rag). Mr. Jones visits his son's apartment. A woman calls then hangs up. Who tidied up Bob's room? Was anything removed from Bob's room?

""I'm not out to change the system."" A man talks to Mr. Jones at the funeral. He sent a picture to Gregg! An old friend tells Mr. Jones about what he did, and gives a name. Jones is taken to a large mansion where is given a lecture about cooperation. Censorship will keep any unwanted news from being published. [A ""D notice, for DORA.] Could Jones be sent to a psychiatric hospital for interfering? Jones goes to visit that secret traitor, who talks about his life. The Suez War changed his life. Will he write out a full confession when asked? Will there be a trick? There is a struggle and a surprise. Next we see that public parade to honor a very important person. Jones walks along the street with his son's remarks in his head. [""The scenes in this movie were purely imaginary.""]

Parts of this film need an understanding of British culture (""beamish boy""). It provides a look at parts of life in Britain. It is about average, the action is kept to a minimum (a low budget?). A better writer and director could have made this a better movie. The reason an old spy would be kept in place is to use him to misdirect the opposition. You can read ""The Double-Cross System"" for an historical example.",1296432000,,2246,4.4731707317073175
