7916363,2,B00003007E,"I bought this DVD based on the one and only review wrote here. I really hoped there's going to be something big in it. Especially after seeing that all who bought Banned from TV & America's Funniest Uncensored bought this DVD as well. But to tell you the truth it was disapointing!
Ok yes some celebs where worth catching on this DVD... but in most parts it is boring plus you cannot see it more than once! So maybe it's worth renting it but not buying it!
In the end, you see that celebs do deserve privacy of their own and any of us if we were in their shoes we'd be very frustrated.
The best part is of Pamela Anderson & Her Ex..! There are so many celebs that I wanted to see where not in this DVD...
In other words, don't hold your breath!",987811200,16,744,4.102739726027397
7916364,5,B00003007E,I thought this dvd was great. You get to see a side of the celebrities that they hide from the puplic. It lets you see that Celebrities are just as human as well as myself. Even though the paparazzi does egg them on it was a neat experience.,943142400,7,241,4.041666666666667
