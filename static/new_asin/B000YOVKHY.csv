The band was great, I really like the interaction between them and the audience. The quality was excellent and I could find nothing to fault it at all.
Yes, the Kentucky 2-disc set (I own that as well) might be somewhat better insofar as content is concerned (more songs and fun) but this disc was just a joy all the way around. Buy it, pour yourself a glass of your favorite beverage, get comfortable, hit play and enjoy!",1488931200,,554,4.4411764705882355

8233582,4,B000YOVKHY,"This is a short concert, less then 10 songs, all by request.
The fidelity, both the audio and video is excellent....stunning.
The host tends to drag out the between song banter/chatter/interviews, which hinders the overall enjoyment of the concert,
however, the band is ""on"", the sound is so rich and the camera work is so good, its worth getting the show if you are a fan.
Dont spend more then $20 for it.",1343088000,,406,4.575342465753424
8233583,1,B000YOVKHY,"It is crazy that some are charging over $100 dollars for this. I found it for cheap. I was excited when I bought it. Once I stuck it in the DVD player, I became more depressed as it played. It is from a live show from CMT. They ask some questions to the band, basically an interview. They sing about 7 song: The Lucky One, Man of Constant Sorrow, Let Me Touch You For Awhile....All new stuff. If you want to see this, I recommend their Double Live DVD.

I'm a HUGE Alison Krauss fan. I have followed her since she was a teenager. Although the DVD is okay, it is not worth much.

I will say this, if you can get this for $20 or under, that would be ok. If you are a true diehard fan like I am, that would make since. But, DO NOT WASTE TOO MUCH MONEY ON THIS. You will feel really cheated. The quality is not that great and as I said before, these are ALL songs they sang on their Live DVD. So I say: BUYER BEWARE.",1236038400,18,912,3.924324324324324
