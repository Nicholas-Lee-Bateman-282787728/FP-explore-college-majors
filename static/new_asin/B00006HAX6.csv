1759196,4,B00006HAX6,"Andie MacDowell is an engaging actress whose films I don't see often enough, yet am gratified when I do. In HARRISON'S FLOWERS, MacDowell plays Sarah Lloyd, the wife of Pulitzer prize-winning photographer Harrison Lloyd (David Strathairn). Both work for Newsweek.
Early on, Harrison is persuaded by his boss to take on one last assignment into harm's way. (This worn out plot device may cause the viewer to cringe. But, let's move on.) So, off Harrison goes with his camera gear to the debris field that was Yugoslavia. It's 1991, and the Croats and Serbs are at each other's throats. A couple weeks later, Sarah receives word that her husband was apparently killed in a building collapse. However, in her gut she believes him to be still alive. So, off she jets to the war zone, leaving her two young children behind, to bring hubby home.
After arriving in Graz, Austria, Sarah rents a car with the intent of driving to Vukovar, where she hopes to find Harrison in the local hospital. In the rental lot, she offers a ride to a young Yugoslav returning from Paris to find his wife. Soon after transiting the border, they cross paths with a rampaging tank accompanied by some very nasty troops, and Sarah is horrifically initiated into the brutal realities of the Serbo-Croat civil war.
In Sarah's subsequent tortuous quest into Hell, Andie's character takes a back seat to those gamely played by Adrien Brody (Kyle Morris) and Brendan Gleeson (Mark Stevenson), media photographers who take Sarah under their wings while moving her forward. For her part, Sarah seems emotionally and psychologically dazed amidst the sudden, random violence and rains of aerial bombs and artillery shells.
HARRISON'S FLOWERS is a gritty, tense and powerful tale in which the French director, Elie Chouraqui, makes no attempt to enlighten the audience on the cultural gulf separating Serb and Croat or the genesis of this particular inter-tribal slaughter. And, for insular U.S. audiences constantly puzzled by Balkan excesses, it probably doesn't matter - all the combatants are crazy.
It's hard to say if the blood lust of the region is realistically depicted or not. However, remembering newspaper reports of the period, it would seem to be. Although the plot is implausible - middle class, American wife swept along to an uncertain destination in the currents of ethnic cleansing - the film is a shocking look at a time and place that most viewers can be thankful they only heard about. And it's probably the closest Andie MacDowell will ever come to being an action hero.",1046217600,4,2556,4.96037296037296
1759197,3,B00006HAX6,"Harrison Lloyd is a photographer who is asked to go into some very dangerous situations.  He talks to his editor about going somewhere safer in deference to his family, and he is told that there is one more assignment he needs to take.  He is asked to go into war-torn Yugoslavia, which he does.  His wife Sarah is told that he has died, but she is convinced that he has not because if this were true ""something would have broken inside me"".  (What writer made up that line?)  She becomes obsessed with finding him and tape records all the t.v. news coverage of the area.  She finally spots him, and, against all odds she travels to the area and gets through places where no one else can.  She is accompanied by her husband's photographer buddies who turn away enemy fire by merely holding up their cameras and shouting ""Press!""  The whole movie comes across as a bit hokey and it's hard to be serious about it when Sarah Lloyd is turned into some kind of Wonder Woman, who is impervious to the bullets which are all around her.",1045267200,,1028,4.430851063829787

1759199,4,B00006HAX6,"Quitte a few years after the end of the yugoslavic civil war , director's Chouraqui movie brings once more back to our memory the biggest tragedy of the Balkans' recent history . Harrison is a journalist whose traces have been lost during a job mission to the then united Yugoslavia . Witnesses claim he is dead yet his wife , Sarah ( MacDowell ) is not conviced . She still believes he is alive and takes a long , risky journey to Vukovar in order to find him .
 Harrison's Flowers presents war in all it's horrow . It's well-made , brutal and realistic film concerning an always opportune subject. Director Chouraqui dezerves congratulations for chosing to focus once more on a war which destroyed millions of people yet the World Community seems to have already forgotten . Also credit must be given to MacDowell who chose to participate and support with her presence a project such as this as well as to Brody and Koteas who i hope that one day will become stars .",1029542400,2,968,4.5

She leaves everything behind to go and search for her photojournalist husband in one of the worst conflicts of the 90's in Yugoslavia and bring him home.  Harrison's Flowers brings war up close and personal.  The scenes of war are horrific and as true to life as one can get without being there in person.

1759239,5,B00006HAX6,"Okay, hear me out, when I first saw Harrison's flowers on HBO almost a decade ago I was enthralled by it; being a photographer and a war buff I was pleasantly surprised and shocked to see this portrayal of war photographers at work in what was the 90's biggest war for correspondents (in the sense that it was one of the only conflicts they were free to roam and get shots you couldn't get by being embedded with US troops in Desert Storm - or be under constant bombardment by Russia in Grozny, Chechnya).  The Yugoslav war definitely stands out for war photographers as something special, good or bad, it was special for them.

Onto the movie, FRENCH/PAL version vs. American release.  Hands down the FRENCH version is superior and it was VERY difficult to find when I bought it, now there's a few copies floating around...

When I saw the French version only a few years ago and the American version 10 years ago, I automatically felt like someone was treating Americans like children in the way the American/HBO (and DVD) version was watered down, there must be at least 15 minutes less, entire characters and their stories are cut out, and even the entire musical score is different.  The French version has some generic synthesizer music and the American version has some violin music throughout, the only plus for the American version.

The PAL/French release however is far superior, you can see great actors such as Brendan Gleeson, Elias Koteas, Caroline Goodall, and even Gerard Butler give these cutaway type interviews in between the action from the eyes of War Photogs (and their families) which they totally cut out of the American version.  I can understand why they watered down the American version, they made the story more concise and about Andie McDowel's journey to fight her husband which can be a plus depending which way you look at it.  But personally, after seeing the American version and the French version (this version I'm reviewing) I'll recommend everything about the French version except the original score which was generic and not very special, the rest, is just a deeper look into the conflict, a deeper look into the mentality of war photographers under fire, and the story of Andie McDowell finding ""Harrison"" is almost second to the war itself.

If you like Harrison Flowers (USA) you'll really at least find Harrison's Flowers (REGION 2) interesting, if not totally awesome.

Just get it!",1371945600,7,2429,4.845410628019324
1759240,4,B00006HAX6,"This is a stark and harsh film of what is happening in other countries right now (civil wars) e.g.  Syria, Africa, Georgia, Afganistan, Iraq, South America (and the beat goes on).  It depicts the horrors of war that our Country has been fortunate to avoid on home soil!  This shocking and continual disregard for human life occurs everyday outside of our comfort zone.  The plot may seem far fetched but in truth the brutality is painfully real.

Now, if your knowledge on the subject is limited, you will have a hard time following the politics of it. And truth be told, even the filmakers are at times confused about it. However, you shouldn't let that prevent you from viewing it; because in its core, it's actually a very basic human story. It is surprisingly accurate, moving, harrowing, suspensful and (dare I say) VERY entertaining. It's a work of fiction but actually based on some real incidents (the infamous invasion of Vukovar and the crimes commited at this time). The acting is excellent all around (Brody, Gleeson and Strathairn especially), but the real star of this film is the lovely Andie MacDowell. The actress (Four Weddings and a Funeral) who has ever been heavily criticized for her 'limited' acting, in this film she proves her worth. In a very difficult role, Ms. MacDowell gives an Oscar-calliber performance that is heartbreaking and very brave. The DVD itself is a quality release. You should ckeck it out, even if you know nothing about that period of Croatian's sad history.

The graphic photography is some of the best of modern war movie-making I've ever seen. The big problem is the absurd plot: the wife of a Newsweek photographer trundles off to Serbia to track down her supposedly dead hubby. She teams up with his colleagues as they look, amid death at any moment. How did Adrian Brody keep his goatee so perfect when no one else is shaving, I wondered?

One can only admire Sarah's courage as--when Harrison is presumed dead, she goes on a mission, risking her own life in a war ravaged country to find him. This film is filled with drama and suspense, as we see the realities of war and those who fall victim to the tyrany and oppression. Perhaps the most touching element in this story though, is when a shell shocked Harrison--is brought back to his loving family by his flowers his son lovingly tended to in his father's absence. Warning: There are gory scenes involving war injuries, army tanks, guns, and war violence. This movie is not suitable for children, and sensitive individuals.

1759246,4,B00006HAX6,"This 2-hour French production with an American cast is an odd combination of a blithely impossible action plot played against a chilling reality. When a world-famous photographer is reported killed in the war-torn former Yugoslavia, his wife flies off from their comfortable home in Westchester to find him and bring him back alive. The best that can be said about this Hollywood-style storyline is that it provides a reason to accomplish something very different - to portray the ghastly truth of ethnic warfare as it took place in the Balkans in the early 1990s and the role of news photographers who risked their lives to capture it with their cameras.

Plunged into Croatia as Vukovar was being overrun by Serbs, the characters take the audience into a hell where everyone - men, women, children - must kill or be killed. We are witness to atrocities and inhumanities that take the breath away. While war in the movies has often been played for thrill-packed adventure - even anti-war films - this one leaves you with a sense of powerlessness in the face of unimaginable horror. Urban warfare and ethnic cleansing cease being abstract concepts. We see their portrayal with our own eyes, and the efforts of one American woman to retrieve her husband in the midst of it all are dwarfed by comparison. Worth seeing anyway for what CNN missed.",1204502400,8,1343,4.864628820960698

1759260,5,B00006HAX6,Outsstanding action drama.  Somewhat tragic.  One of the most realistic war films I have ever watched.

1759261,4,B00006HAX6,"It's hard to say say you like a movie about death and tragedy, but it's told well, in a way that helps expose the nature behind obsession, and the things people care about. There is the Hollywood tinsel, of course, and it has it's awkwardly cheesy moments, but when the bullets start flying and the cameras start snapping...you'll be hooked.

The first time I saw this, I only caught the second half. It grabbed me enough to make me want to buy it, so naturally I came here. Some of the stuff in this movie are hard to take. You watch a masked soldier chasing what you assume to be a teacher and her students into a building. He waits for them all to go inside, and then lobs a grenade inside after them. And it tears at your soul to know that these things happen. It's less of a brooding retrospective look at conflict as it is a disturbing social commentary on indifference, and those who oppose it. The movie is ABOUT love, but to me it takes a backseat to the bigger picture, and I think it would have been much better without it.

A little girl in a yellow dress waving and smiling at the photographer's as they pass in a car. Later you see the same little girl lying at the steps of a blown-out bus, raped and murdered. It's a morbid, depressing movie, and I think the love story was meant to offset this, and try to bring balance, that even through the worst of things, the best remains. But even love cannot change things that were. I would recommend this movie...it rings of something like Lord of War in terms of depressing.",1189468800,,1534,4.322916666666667
1759262,4,B00006HAX6,"Well-made movie with high production values (true widescreen, good music, sound) manages to keep interest alive in spite of having very little story material to work with.  I disagree with the claim that the movie was unrealistic.  For example, sneaking past the snipers by crawling through the brush a hundred yards away is not incredible as depicted.  And smiling at the checkpoints was a good rouse: it made the sentries think the journalists were on their side, so of course they wanted them to take their pictures.

The purpose of the movie seemed to be mainly to describe, to show the human costs of war.  No attempt at understanding this particular war, just showing the atrocities.  At least they had the decency to say that BOTH sides were committing atrocities.  Usually, in American movies it's only the Serbs that are the bad guys.

It's all very well to say that war is bad, but we already know that.  The question is, what do you do when you are attacked?  This is what Americans are still arguing about.

This is a very moving film, which touches on many things -- not least of which is the role of the press in times of war. This ethical question has not become any less important with the Iraq war, and will undoubtedly increase in its importance in wars to come.

Overall, this is a very well-produced film, with very talented actors indeed, that will definitely become one of my most frequently watched films. The one thing that could be improved on, however, and that could've pushed this to be one of my favourite films, would be the plot. Not the plot of the war, of course, that is a well-stated fact.

No, I'm speaking specifically about the plot of the journalist-wife who goes into this psychiatric state, yet is allowed to travel into a war-zone instead of being prescribed psychiatric help. I do find this a bit hard to fully believe, and this takes up a bit too much of the film, in my opinion.

But still, put the popcorn on -- a good movie, by all accounts.",1172188800,,988,4.412087912087912
1759265,3,B00006HAX6,"Oddly this movie includes some of the best acting and some of the worst I've seen recently. Adrian Brody as a hard-nosed photographer in a theater of war is really compelling; meanwhile, Andie MacDowell, handsome as ever but no more talented, delivers every line in a disconcertingly wooden way.

This disjunction somehow seems apropos of the film's gripping and (to my eye) realistic portrayal of the scene of war: gray, monotonous, punctuated by horrifying violence. In some of the shots inside the car, the dull rhythm of the windshield wipers scraping across the window of the grimy TV van attempting to nose its way further into the war zone becomes like the tell-tale heart. I about jumped out of my skin when they were shot at!

The movie, in short, has some astonishingly good moments, especially in the war scenes. The male actors are really impressive, though David Strathairn is assigned more than even he can deliver when he must remain catatonic for over a year (I think there is a Shirley Temple movie with a similar hospital scene in which a bandaged war veteran groans ""Sarah, Sarah"" -- A Little Princess?). Sentimentalized tripe. At the same time, the film is unblinking in its unsentimentalized portrayal of war. Contradictions... contradictions. Still, worth watching.",1156636800,,1287,5.037558685446009
1759266,3,B00006HAX6,"Yes it's kind of a corn-fed theme, but imagine a warring Yugoslavia from fifteen years ago. As its city of Vukovar is being ripped to smithereens, our Newsweek journalist goes MIA. This sets sets up the perfect pretext for his New Yorker wife, played by a suitably melancholy Andie McDowell (also a journalist, which made me wonder about their ten bedroom house), to take a flying trip into the thick of all that macabre action.

I sat tight hoping for what promised to be a gritty love-during-war film with an Eastern European twist, but all it really was was a dress rehearsal for Adrien Brody's award-winning cameo in The Pianist two years afterward.

My problems began when voice-overs of all the characters sprung up in the middle of the script. A curious narrative technique for a theme of this nature. Just when you were in the moment feeling dumbstruck with what you had just seen, out came someone in candid camera reminiscing after the fact. Smacks to me of an eleventh hour decision made during post-production, or a failed stunt to lend a realistic tone to the film (we are told it is based on real events).

As a War-is-Evil statement it succeeds to an extent in depicting some heinous atrocities of war, supported amply by a brilliant score, but I left with no more appreciation for the ethnic belligerence in the Balkans than I had before the film. ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" or ""No Man's Land"" have stricken a lot more strident note in that regard.

While our motley crew of reporters meandered through cavernous cities, the romantic undercurrent held my interest in parts but unravelled much too slowly, leaving enough time for some key melodrama to unfold. In a sloppy finale, when the Mr. Harrison of the title is found and brought back to the warmth of his humongous family house, all his remnant trauma is resolved much too quickly. Other than a few magical flowers it is rather unclear what brought about his turnaround.

Much of my three-star appreciation for the film goes to the cinematographers for evoking a smoking war zone which includes some very difficult shoots through a nightmarish countryside. The 48 journalists that the DVD tells us were killed during the conflict had a clear purpose to leave a memory of the war for posterity, but the purpose of this commemorative film is anyone's guess.",1143244800,,2322,4.795
1759267,3,B00006HAX6,"Stirring war drama + sappy love story with a rather tunnel-visioned heroine + powerful performances by Adrien Brody and the always-excellent Brendan Gleeson = a film that's watchable enough on cable on a rainy afternoon, but not 100% satisfying. Brody practically steals every scene he's in as bitter but dedicated photojournalist Kyle Morris, who's grieving for a friend and fellow photographer killed in the Balkan war yet still manages to help Sarah Lloyd (Andie MacDowell in a nicely understated performance) find her presumed-dead husband Harrison (David Strathairn, who doesn't get much to do except look earnest, but is a likable presence all the same. My husband, accustomed to seeing him as bad guys in DOLORES CLAIBORNE and others, found it refreshing to see Strathairn in a sympathetic role for a change), who's a prize-winning photojournalist on one last job for Newsweek. Brody's Kyle is a fascinating bundle of contradictions, in a realistic way. (For one thing, it's kind of refreshing to see that Kyle is not immediately vilified for abusing cocaine at one point in the film -- although my smart-aleck hubby couldn't resist a wisecrack about the amount of coke needed to fill a nose like Brody's! Men! :-) As a mom, I was troubled that Sarah was willing to leave her two children at the drop of a hat to go to Croatia to look for Harrison. Yeah, she left the kiddies with her mom (always nice to see 1960s fave Diane Baker get work), but what if Harrison was indeed dead and then Sarah went and got herself killed, too? I can hear the kids now: ""So we're orphans because Mom loved Dad so much she went off to the war zone herself instead of getting the Red Cross or something to help her find him? Thanks for nothing, Mom!""  BTW, HARRISON'S FLOWERS is the second film in a row (after BREAD AND ROSES) in which Adrien Brody sports bedhead and a beard, lending him a cuddly look even in his most intense moments, IMO. If I may allow my hormones to do the talking for a moment, Brody might want to consider playing more roles where he gets to look like that! :-)",1100736000,4,2075,4.653950953678474

The actuality of the scenes, I'm sure, are only a small percentage of the reality.
The movie reveals what people will do to one another for whatever reason, politics, religion, predjudice...and more.
The subject as to why & how photo journalists do what they do is deeply explored. Is it money, competition, compassion, devotion to ones beliefs or just the adrenalin rush of the situation?  How do their families tolerate the seperation & fear that their significant other may never come home? What holds this all together?
I see many things in a movie, not just from the entertainment point but the story, director interpertation, the actors portrayal, the depth of the characters history and where they come from both intelectually, emotionally, psychologically & spirtually.

Yugoslavia breaks up faster than the Yugo.  Christians, the Orthodox, and Moslems rape and kill indiscriminately in WW2 style battles through ancient cities back in the early 90's.  Clinton and the UN send in troops to break this one up.  Clinton promises the troops will be home by Christmas.  They are still there, but the New York Times never complains.  I digress.

Would a woman with two children go into hell to find her missing husband? I don't think so unless it was in the middle of a Macy's special.  I'm sorry.  Just wanted to say that the idea of Andi getting into Yugoslavia and finding a needle in a bloody haystack is absurd, but this movie does show the blood bath.  In fact, the director seems to wallow in needless body counts.  Yes there were atrocities.  I have less understanding of the conflict after this movie than I had before.  What's this all about?

There is a fine performance by Adrien Brody as the hyperactive photojournalist.  His buddy Brendan Gleason does a fine job too.",1092009600,7,1143,4.645
1759280,5,B00006HAX6,"I watched this movie for two reasons: I like Andie MacDowell and my last name is Harrison.
I liked this movie because I am a Viet nam vet that fought in Tet and therefore I have some considerable experience with war in a city, or as the Army used to call it War in a Built Up Area.  If you have actually seen this kind of war, the movie is frighteningly accurate and like war, necessisarily fragmentary and incomplete.
For example, in one perfect and horrific, scene Andie MacDowell and her two journalist companions are moving through a city to find a hospital where her husband may be.  They come upon a situation: a young child, probably a girl runs out of a building in front of them.  A soldier follows her out of the building, and kills her.  War's brutality?  Certainly.  A killing mad soldier, killing an innocent child.  Possibly.  But, even more likely, the scene represents wars brutality on multiple levels.  If you knew that the child had just thrown a hand grenade and the soldier escaped it but his buddy, or even more likely in this kind of war, his actual brother did not would that change the nature of the scene for you?  Or, if that was true and you knew that the child had another hand grenade, or a pistol, would that change your impression of the meaning of the scene?  And how about that soldier many years later as he looks down at his own child, assuming he survives the war, will he be able to forget the look on that other chid's face as he shot her?  However good his reason and in real war there are many reasons that can make such an act necessary, will he be able to forget, or will it haunt him.  This kind of awful situation, but not unusual situation, is precisely why William T. Sherman said that ""War is Hell."" For a soldier, having killed a child for any reason must be true Hell, but to have done it on purpose.  That would be worse.  While I avoided shooting at children, the reality of war among civilians is worse than you could ever imagine even in a nightmare.  Say you are a sentry and there is a car speeding toward your post.  You open fire.  The car stops.  Your post is safe.  But it turns out that a child is dead.  The car was speeding to get to the hospital. That is war in the city and all you have is an instant to make up your mind to shoot, or not to shoot.  To kill, or not to kill, and either way to live with the aftermath.
Do the sailors or Marines on watch on the USS Cole wished that they had fired.  Even if their orders were not to fire.  Even if the approach of the boat with a bomb in it did not look like an attack.  Even if a child had been steering the boat with a bomb.  I have no doubt that they all wished that they had fired.  And they will wish that, and relive that, until they too die.  In that sense they are as much causalities of war as their shipmates that suffered actual physical hurt.  The Captain of that ship, the Officer of the Day, the Watch officer all will relive and replay that day and regret that no one fired soon or often enough.  Watch this movie and you will see what I mean.  There are things that happen in war that are horrible, to everybody.
I have seen war and I have seen many war movies - but only rarely have I seen a movie as true to the appalling core of the experience as this is.  As our soldiers fight a shadow war in Iraq and in Afghanistan it would be good to remember that war is hell.  If you have forgotten, this is a very accurate picture of it.
Yes, the plot is a tad implausible, but I would hope that the wife that my son chooses when he grows up would do as Andie MacDowell's fictional character does and fight to find out what happened to him.  I know my wife would.",1074816000,41,3686,4.145070422535211
1759281,2,B00006HAX6,"""Harrison's Flowers"" would be complete and utter cinematic dreck were it not for the fact that it presents an honest and unflinching portrayal of the extreme dangers faced by the brave men and women who covered the Balkan Wars in the early to mid `90s.  That harrowing depiction of the journalists and photojournalists aside, ""Harrison's Flowers"" is not even close to being a good enough movie to recommend.

The story of this film centers on the disappearance of gifted photojournalist, Harrison Lloyd (David Straitharn), while covering for Newsweek civil conflict in the former Yugoslavia.  It is presumed by everyone that Harrison was captured and executed by aggressive rebels along with a number of other innocents.  Everyone assumes he is dead, except his wife, Sarah (Andie MacDowell), who believes she saw him in obscure camera footage recorded after his supposed death and believes him to be alive.  So, she decides to take off on a quest to bring Harrison back home alive.  Among those who end up assisting her in this goal is Harrison's professional rival, Kyle (Adrien Brody), and a few other photojournalists played by Elias Koteas and Brendan Gleeson.

Let's stop for a minute and analyze what is taking place.  Sarah Lloyd is a typical soccer mom who understands her husband's chosen career and the dangers inherent in it, but she has no knowledge of how to perform that job.  Yet, now she wants to go on a crusade to rescue to her husband in a foreign land where outsiders are raped, assaulted, and murdered just for fun.  She does this even though she has young children who need to be looked after and are already reeling from the supposed loss of one parent.  Sarah has no knowledge, experience, or support that would make anyone think she has a remote chance of achieving her goal, let alone surviving.  She just flies off blindly on a mission that could very likely leave her children as orphans.

Interestingly enough, that display of complete irresponsibility is not even the worst part of this film.  What really undermines this film is a smattering of unexplained and unnecessary characters, plot developments straight from the `clich&eacute; handbook', and a truly atrocious performance by the lead who plays Sarah, Andie MacDowell.  While there is no disputing MacDowell's ability to convey Sarah's grief, that is all the range that MacDowell shows throughout the whole movie.  It's impossible to believe that this woman who seems to have no emotions other than crying, whining, and shrieking could be able to be functional enough to even go on this quest, let alone succeed in it.  She seems truly and utterly helpless and the audience cannot make a great enough leap to believe that her undying love (and help from a few colleagues) would be enough to guide her to Harrison.

The plot developments from `clich&eacute;s `R Us' includes such tired conventions as one character being too scared to move out of the line of fire, so a brave character goes to save him and gets shot instead.  Uggh!  I saw that turn of events coming a mile away, and so will anyone will any movie-going experience.  Among the superfluous characters is an eager young Balkan gentleman who is bent on providing transportation to Sarah once she lands in country and seems to have been authorized by someone to provide that assistance.  Yet, there are no further allusions made to what this character's purpose is and when he's killed three minutes later, he is all but forgotten.  Such a character can be explained if this were a documentary or based on a actual people and events, but in a fictional drama, it's just distracting.

This incredibly trite, implausible story would garner a one-star rating if it were not for the uncompromising depiction of the Balkan War.  Perhaps if the filmmakers had decided to change to the focus and deal strictly with the war and its atrocities, then they might have had something.  Instead, they use a real tragedy to play backdrop to a threadbare love story.  Unacceptable!",1074556800,5,4016,4.902366863905326

1759283,4,B00006HAX6,"The wife of a photojournalist thought killed in the early days of the Yugoslavian civil war, believes her husband is still alive and rashly makes her way to the heart of that hellish conflict, with the aid of some other cynical war photographers.
You may find the premise a bit incredible, but make the leap of faith that the character of the wife does, because it will take you, as it does her, on a journey through Hell on earth, and shock and stun you as it does this sophisticated, yet naive, middle-class American woman.
The film accomplishes something important in that it manages to take a place and time with events we think we know about, and shove it into our consciousness with the shock of the new!  How can people behave this way?  Where is sanity and justice and morality?  Do these terms even have relevance in the face of furious and indifferent cruelty.  The wife's love and determination is nearly overwhelmed by the fear and violence surrounding her.
A very competent cast does well, with Adrien Brody a standout.  But this is a director's showcase and Elie Chouraqui and company do an outstanding job in shaking out our complacency and reminding us again of the horrors of that nasty little conflict and its ""ethnic cleansing"" thugs and monsters.",1058227200,3,1266,4.710407239819005

1759287,4,B00006HAX6,"Reviewer: A viewer from Kansas City, MO
This gripping film is a tribute to the 40+ journalists who died covering the war in the Balkans. The story centers around Andie MacDowell's character's search for her Pulitzer-award-winning photographer husband, who was reportedly killed when a building collapses in the war. Sarah Lloyd (Andie) is convinced that her husband is still alive, so she leaves behind her two young children & her job at Newsweek to venture to Serb-held Vukovar to find him. Her journey is fraught with violence -- shortly after she crosses into Yugoslavia, she encounters a Serb roadblock, where her hitchhiker/passenger/guide, a charming Croatian student in Paris returning to find his wife & baby, is needlessly executed, the rented Audi is crushed by a tank, and Sarah barely escapes rape. She is ""rescued"" by fellow journalists, and undaunted, continues her seeming suicide mission to find her husband in Vukovar. The violence in this film rivals anything you'll find on screen (think two hours of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan) and you'll hear the ... word at least once a minute -- but it is well worth seeing. It will foster an appreciation of what photojournalists go through to document history, putting themselves at risk certainly as much as the soldiers, without the support & protection of an Army being them (albeit voluntarily). My only concern is that the film may oversimplify the issues underlying the conflict -- it depicts Serbs as evil and Croats as - - well, not evil, providing a relatively safe haven for the journalists. However, the film is not so much about the conflict itself as it is about the sacrifices of the journalists covering the conflict.",1047686400,4,1706,5.01056338028169
