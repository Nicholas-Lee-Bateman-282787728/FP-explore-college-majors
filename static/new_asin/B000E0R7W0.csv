8157915,1,B000E0R7W0,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF CATCOM HOME STUDIOS DBL. FEATURE ""THE CRAWLING EYE/ KILLER SHREWS"" RELEASE HERE. 20+DOLLARS FOR THIS STUDIOS MOVIES, IS WAY OVER-PRICED FOR SUCK LACK-LUSTER QUALITY. Do not even bother, their only quality as a Studio, is that they release hard to find film, but its not made the way it should be.

 This is really cheap studio, they do not remaster any of the films. You would be better off getting the Euro version, that was made for the USA, at about 5-7 with shipping. Plus your getting a stellar print. Image does great work on the films they release. So get some soda, popcorn and a proper copy of this great gem from the 50's and enjoy!
 Dont get me wrong, this is from personal experience. Go with Image, once again and enjoy!

PS: in my opinion do not buy this version this item and",1318291200,3,810,4.38

Two of my favorite creature features that still pleasantly haunt me from my childhood.

ABOUT THE DVD: HERE'S THE PROBLEM

The DVD put out by ""CATCOM VIDEO"" offers a pretty good transfer of the ""KILLER SHREWS"" but a very faded and degraded video transfer of ""The Crawling Eye"". That's a real shame because I was hoping the Crawling Eye would be a better transfer than the 2 VHS versions I also have, but the videos played better than this DVD.

There is also a part missing, which is also missing from the 2 video editions I have. In it, ""Hans"" is fleeing in a car from the Hotel and drives into the crawling eye which explains how he later returned as a zombie to attempt to slay Ann Pilgrim [Janet Murnro]. This scene was deleted over time, probably to fit TV time slots, and I was hoping that this ""Catcom"" DVD would have restored this scene. I do plan on buying other editions of ""The Crawling Eye"", as I am not completely satisfied with this DVD edition, especially because of the missing scene and the poor video quality. You see, I really do enjoy this film, which was the first scary movie my older brother took me to see, almost 48 years ago.

The Killer Shrews, on the other hand, played as well as the video version did when it was brand new. This DVD is worth the price easily, just for ""The Killer Shrews"".

BONUS FEATURE: A CARTOON THAT REALLY GROWS ON YOU - REEL-EE!

You get a really neat cartoon from the silent film era, involving a ""RAREBIT"", a cute little creature who keeps growing, and growing, and growing. It features the lovely music of Schubert's Piano Improvisational Sonata and there is a parody of King Kong which includes an air attack by armed bi-planes. I kid you not!

BOTTOM LINE:

Despite the video quality problems that afflict ""The Crawling Eye"", this DVD is still a tremendous bargain and both the ""RAREBIT"" cartoon and ""The Killer Shrews"" play quite well. Plus, ""The Crawling Eye"" is a really good movie, especially for the genre.",1140134400,5,1985,4.522346368715084
