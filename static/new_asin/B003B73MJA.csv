The movie works on my computer I haven't tried it in our dvd player though. (Has subtitles in English)
It's not HD quality, but I wasn't expecting that anyways.
The movie was really sad but still a great movie.

It came in great condition and about a week after purchasing it. No problems with it at all. :]",1370822400,,430,4.119047619047619

8393500,5,B003B73MJA,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie.  It arrived sooner than anticipated; in about 3 days from a place in S.F.  The movie was not your Disney show but the legend of Mulan was portrayed well in the Chinese film.  It has English subtitles.  I liked the story, and the way it ended was surprising but true to Chinese values/virtues.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone wanting to know more about the legend of Mulan.  I don't know how true it is but it's extremely good.",1332806400,2,476,4.3522727272727275
8393501,1,B003B73MJA,"I ordered the Region-3 Edition that is a dual-layer DVD, and comes with a slipcase. I was sent a cheap bootleg on a DVD-5 disc (single layer). Picture quality was abysmal. No special features. If someone is selling this edition as ""all-region"", you'll probably get the same DVD",1296691200,,277,4.791666666666667
8393502,1,B003B73MJA,"If the seller is saying in their comments it is all-region, you'll get a bootleg. I've struck out twice already and got the exact same bootleg both times. Cover art is blurry, case is cheap, no slipcase as on the official version, and it is a cheap single-layer DVD with poor quality video that is barely watchable. Contact your seller and make sure you get the official Region-3 DVD. If you don't have an all-region player, you can probably play it in your computer.",1294617600,,467,4.571428571428571
8393503,5,B003B73MJA,"This was a great movie about Love, courage, family, war, friendship, betrayal, so on and so fourth.  The picture and costumes were great but the acting was fantastic.  I found myself crying a few times towards the end of the movie.  This is a must watch movie!!",1278547200,,261,4.51063829787234
8393504,5,B003B73MJA,"This movie was made in China. Time magazine describes this movie as a redefinition of the legendary Chinese heroine after Disney's 12 years stereotyping. China Central Television 1 (CCTV1), the most authoritative and influential medium in China, reported this movie in its evening news. So I watched this movie and found that it was an authentic representation of the legendary Chinese heroine and some traditional Chinese values. It is good that western audience can listen to the original Chinese in the movie while understanding the content with the aid of the English subtitles.

In contrast to the Disney's version, which portraits a young girl breaking the confines of tradition to pursue her own destiny, the Chinese version projects the traditional Chinese values of filial piety, patriotism, faith, and courage. The heroine Hua Mulan disguises herself as a man to replace her ailing father in the conscription army. During her 12 years in the army, she confronts the death of her rivals and her comrades. Grappling with the brutality of war, she is promoted to the general's position with a duty of guarding her country (Wei) from being invaded by Rouran and protecting her soldiers from death. On the one hand, this movie is about war, death, and brotherhood. It is quite touching when Hua Mulan leads the rest of the army to sing the old ballad to ease the fear and pain of soldiers who are captured by Rouran and are on the edge of being killed. The general tone of the movie is gloomy. You will see the tension between two armies, some ancient Chinese war strategies, and sand storm which was the common natural disaster that killed many soldiers in the ancient western China.

On the other hand, this movie is about love. Jingle Ma, the movie's director, is well-known for his romance movies. Instead of making this movie a complete war epic, Jingle Ma portrays the romantic side. The love between Hua Mulan and Wen Tai, the son of the emperor of Wei and a general, is implicit and conveyed via mutual encouragement and support. More importantly, they commit themselves to their duties for their country and their promise for their soldiers. In the end, Wen Tai accepts the emperor's decision and marries the princess of Rouran to maintain good relationship between two countries. It is sad to end in this way, but such an ending reflects the value of self-sacrifice for the general good in the traditional Chinese value system.

The movie is worthy of watching because it depicts both a tough and vulnerable woman. Hua Mulan is brave and tough in the battlefield. However, her hesitation of killing the Rouran general shows her mercy and her confusion of the killing action. Wen Tai's words, ""In the battlefield, you cannot have feelings"" awaken her to the reality. Nevertheless, she cries a lot. At night, she looks at the star in the dark sky and thinks of home. The movie is realistic.

The movie is worthy of watching also because of its casting. Jingle Ma originally invited Zhang Ziyi to play Hua Mulan; however, he finally chose Zhao Wei because of her popularity in mainland China. Zhao Wei, a master student in movie directing, is praised for her performance in the role of Yao Mulan, a fictional Chinese heroine in Moment in Peking, a TV drama which was adapted from Lin Yutang's historical novel. Interestingly, this novel was written in English and published in the western world as an introduction to Chinese culture. Several years later, it was translated into Chinese and introduced to Chinese audience. In 2005, the TV version of the novel was shown in CCTV1 and received nationwide acclaim. Besides, Jaycee Chen, son of Jackie Chen, plays a humorous character in the movie. Vitas, the Russian singer who gained tremendous popularity in China, plays a foreign prince who is captured and works as a slave in the Rouran camp.

The music of the movie is pleasant. The movie begins with Vitas's ""dolphin tone"" (high-pitched falsetto). He also sings the English version of the theme song ""Beneath the Glory."" It is worthy of staying till the very end of the movie to enjoy another two songs: ""Mulan Love"" by Sun Yanzi and ""Mulan Star"" by Zhang Liangying, the singer who came out of the Chinese version of ""American Idol."" The two songs resonate with Hua Mulan's character: she is both tough and vulnerable.

Anyway, this move is about war. Furthermore, it is about Hua Mulan's feeling. The movie ends with Hua Mulan's monologue: ""Some say travel too far and you will forget your home. Kill too much and you will forget yourself. When you die in a battlefield, your life sinks into the ground like rain without a trace. At that time, if you fall in love with someone, hope will blossom again from the earth and passionately embrace life.""

Compared to the idealistic Disney's version, the Chinese version may disappoint western audience with the absence of the Mu Xu dragon. But China takes back its legend.",1275350400,24,4932,4.850356294536817
8393505,4,B003B73MJA,"I bought this movie because Vitas has a cameo in it. It has english subtitles and plays all region dvd players so is a good buy for us Americans. It is well acted and the story is good. The guys will like the battles and the girls will like the love story. It is well done, great costumes, scenery and filming. Even kids can watch because no swearing or sex scenes, thank you china:) Vitas sings the opening-he's so cute! My only problem was because the menu is in chinese I can't access the special features. Because it's foreign film none of the movie rental stores have it. It was definetely worth buying!",1273536000,6,608,4.389380530973451
