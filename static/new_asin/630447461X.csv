7873564,5,630447461X,"This is a fantastic video.  I show it at the end of my weather lessons, and the students love it.  It mostly talks about tornadoes and hurricanes, but it also goes into why the weather does what it does.  The photography is so great - on par for National Geographic.  Another good companion video is National Geographic ""Storm of the Century.""  (that is more entertaining.) If you are looking to learn something about weather and see some fabulous footage, this is the video for you.",1210377600,,483,4.635294117647059
