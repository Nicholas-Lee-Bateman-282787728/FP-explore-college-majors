8410712,5,B003ZQ3UOO,"Would like to see a REGION 1 release of the entire series (seasons 1-3) of Ashes to Ashes. Considering BBC America aired the first two seasons, but didn't air the third. Why they can't at least release the third as a DVD set I find ridiculous.",1421712000,2,243,4.304347826086956
8410713,5,B003ZQ3UOO,"If you like British television series, and especially if you have seen the Brit version of ""Life on Mars"", you must get the Ashes to Ashes Series 1,2, and 3! The clever byplay and character interaction is still fresh and lively, but you get attached to the characters and want the show to never end.  This a first-rate period cop show and I wish we had this kind of programming on our side of the pond. Just brilliant and fun. I do recommend this series without reservation!",1390003200,2,474,4.448275862068965
8410714,5,B003ZQ3UOO,"This is the follow up series  to LIFE ON MARS (Brit version).  It has never been released in Region 1 and I see nothing indicationg that it will.  I got a Region 1 copy of Series 1/2 from an online source that sells for shipping and handling only but didn't have series 3.

I bought a reasonably priced all region player from Amazon that works great and then bought Series 3 (region 2) from Amazon.

This series is not for the average britcom or Masterpiece Theater /Mystery american viewer, but for Brit Science Fiction fans it is fantastic.  I loved every minute.  It answered all, and I mean all, the questions left by Life on Mars.  Buy a fregion free player , buy this, and then buy all sorts of british series that aren't available in Region 1.",1387065600,3,750,4.384057971014493
8410715,5,B003ZQ3UOO,A brilliant end to s superb series. One of the most original concepts for s series ever brought Tao the screen. Impossible to stop watching.,1316736000,2,140,4.64
8410716,5,B003ZQ3UOO,"If one views the entire LIFE ON MARS and ASHES TO ASHES series, one is left with the realization that what has transpired on the screen is nothing less than superlative.  ASHES TO ASHES (Series 3) concludes the time travel/police drama that began with Sam Tyler in LIFE ON MARS and finishes with Alex Drake in ASHES TO ASHES. Sam Tyler (John Simm) begins the epic saga as a time traveling Manchester police inspector who has a car accident and like Hank Morgan in A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT is whisked back twenty five years into the past to commence his police career amidst a most politically incorrect era. Alex Drake (Keeley Hawes) is another police officer who is similarly transported back to a time just a few years ahead of where/when Sam Tyler landed.  She deals with the very same crew that bedeviled Tyler for years.  Yet when she appears, Tyler has been reported dead for eight years and she is determined to know what happened to her and by extension to herself.  Now in most time travel tales, there are the inevitable paradoxes, and both Tyler and Drake must face them.  Complicating matters is the surprising inclusion of some pretty not-so-subtle psychological and spiritual subtexts which call into question such disparate motifes as love, duty, God, and hope.

Tyler and Drake are much more alike than different.  They both firmly believe in The Law and that all phenomena must have a logical explanation.  When they encounter their boss, DCI Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister), who is the very essence of brute head-breaking, they rebel.  Tyler and Hunt occasionally come to blows.  Drake, being a most attractive woman, relate on a more sensual level.  They are attracted to each other but both acknowledge that a personal relation is out of the question.  Both series have a common cast.  DC Ray Carling (Dean Andrews) reveres Hunt and is himself a sort of Hunt-to-be.  DC Chris Skelton (Marshall Lancaster) is similarly disgusted with Hunt's savagery.  He sees first Tyler as a ""mentor"" and later Drake as a revered ""mum.""  A new cast addition to ASHES TO ASHES is WPC Chaz Granger, who loves Skelton and is a decent sort who frequently muses that she is not cut out for the rigors of police work.  Though both Tyler and Drake never lose their respect for The Law, they both learn to accept that the universe is not the Enlightenment Era of Logic that they took for granted.  How could they both have been temporally relocated to the past?  How can they still have auditory and visual connection to their future presents?  Now these are weighty questions indeed and what marks both series as probably the best science fiction dramas of this or any age is their blending of what we know with what we do not.

Both dramas begin with hints about the ultimate direction that leads to the last episode of ASHES TO ASHES.  These hints accrue incrementally.  It helps if the reader is familiar with the alternate realities of LOST and the similar slip stream time flows of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Both of these suggest a life beyond this one and where one finds oneself is a function of who you are and how you see yourself.  Tyler and Drake have to consider ALL the possibilities of their transferal. Both have been critically injured in their time.  Both hear incessantly noises that suggest that they are really in a hospital bed, dying.  Both have to face the possibility that they are already dead and that their renewed lives in the past occur in a sort of purgatorial limbo where dead and dying officers go.  DCI Hunt, for all his brutishness, learns that he is a part of this divine deception. It is this slow process of self-revelation for everyone that stamps LIFE ON MARS and ASHES TO ASHES as a once in a life experience.  At the very end when Carling, Skelton, Granger, and Drake are permitted to exit this limbo, a new traveller from the future appears, demanding to know who are the officers in his altered squad room in 1983 and where is his I-Pod.  DCI Hunt grimly accepts this new one as part of his altered crew and the circle goes on.

To see the new ASHES TO ASHES, one must have a DVD player that can play Region 2 DVDs or a computer that has DVD capability.  Both series raise more questions than they resolve about life, death, and man's place in the universe.  Only the best dramas can do that.",1289692800,13,4345,4.624511082138201
8410717,5,B003ZQ3UOO,"The journey that started with Sam Tyler in ""Life on Mars"" ends in a stunning and (to me) totally unexpected fashion in the final episode, when All Is Revealed. In retrospect, there were hints along the way, but it still was (to me) a surprise. The end of the journey is both delightful and poignant. I found it perfectly judged, and one has to applaud the BBC for having the guts to make this sort of thing.

But it's all over :-( I really am going to miss Gene, with his political incorrectness, his wonderful barbed one-liners, but beneath the shell, his essential humanity and his extraordinary devotion to the job, the extent of which is only revealed in that final episode. Philip Glenister has given us one of the great TV characters. He and the rest of the cast (Bolly, Raymondo, Chris, Shaz and of course the Quattro) made a great team. I think it'll be a while before we see their equal again.",1283212800,12,902,4.466666666666667
