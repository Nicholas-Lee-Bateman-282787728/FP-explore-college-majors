8558138,5,B00AW1BCZY,you will get a work out . Your money will not be wasted. I have done the sexy abs and I had to take a few breaks. I'm not a person who works out much but even I was able to keep up with the sexy ab workout. It was easy but it wasn't unapproachable either. I haven't tried the  yoga cd and the bikini workout was difficult it is not for beginners.,1397433600,,346,3.73972602739726
