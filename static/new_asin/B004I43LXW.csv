8430006,3,B004I43LXW,"The over all picture quality is good. Very shallow knowledge on the subject of keris in the short video. The keris fight demo is  something that I have never seen before. For someone who really like to know more about the legendary keris , I'd recommend reading - Tafsir Keris- an interpretation, by Tony Junis. Administration wise- excellent service by Amazon.",1400976000,,361,4.918032786885246
8430007,5,B004I43LXW,You may not learn how to become a master of the Keris but it is informative and very well produced. I found it to be a good introduction to one of the more esoteric weapons used both ritually and combatively.,1395014400,,208,4.225
8430008,5,B004I43LXW,"Interesting dvd about an area you never expect this from!

Compliments!
Hope to see more from remote areas like this from Malaysia.",1361491200,,177,5.137931034482759
8430009,5,B004I43LXW,"When I think ""Thailand martial arts"", Muay Thai, Krabi Krabong and the various bareknuckle styles comes to mind. Little did I know that in the Southern region of Thailand, Silat is practiced instead of the indigenous Thai arts. In the ""Village of the Keris"" DVD, some of the Sila (Thai Silat) as practiced in Southern Thailand are demonstrated from the various lineages.

The meat of the DVD has Guru Atabu instructing on the making of the Keris as well as a form and application. Like Muay Thai's 1-2-Round Kick, the ""Village of the Keris"" DVD is a good combination of overview, history, and technique. Excellent production values and good information makes this a good DVD. I highly recommend the ""Village of the Keris"" DVD to anyone with interest in Silat, Keris, Thai arts, as well as to any martial artists who contemplate travelling to different countries to train from the source.

8430010,5,B004I43LXW,"""Village of the Keris: The Art of Bun Dai Sara"", is the latest release from filmmaker/martial artist Vincent Giordano.  The DVD introduces the viewer to Yala, a Muslim region in Southern Thailand, where smiths have been forging Keris for centuries.

  The Keris, a mysterious, asymmetrical dagger with a wavy blade, is usually associated with the martial art of Silat.  It is both a weapon and a spiritual object.  Viewers are shown how the Kreis is made, as well as combat applications.

  Guru Atabu, a master craftsman from Raman, Yala, explains the art of Keris making.  He also demonstrates the training rituals and Kris fighting techniques of the Bun Dai Sara system of Sila (Thai Silat).  Different segments show evasion and stepping patterns, thrusting, using the sheath in combat, partner training, and more.

  Malaysian masters are also featured in ""Village of the Keris"".  Guru Azlan Ghanie demonstrates Silat Melayu Kreis Lok 9, a system that teaches the Kreis as ""a basic weapon of war,"" designed ""to give a deeper understanding of both armed and unarmed combat"".

  A brief segment discusses Tomoi, the Malay art of kickboxing.  Master Dowd shows some empty handed applications that combine both Tomoi and Silat.  His techniques are simple, powerful, and practical, and his energy is infectious.  It would be great to see more on Master Dowd in the future.

  Overall, ""Village of the Keris"" is a fascinating, informative DVD that covers an art and weapon that gets little to no mainstream coverage.  Unlike most Southeast Asian martial arts, which were developed by Buddhist cultures, we explore arts and weapons with an Islamic background.  Once again, Vincent Giordano takes you on a journey to a world most Westerners are never exposed to. Anyone interested in Silat, blades, and metalwork will appreciate ""Village of the Keris"".",1294617600,,1848,5.117449664429531
8430011,5,B004I43LXW,"I was very impressed about the amount information contained in this DVD, I watched it several times times and picked up additional things that I missed. The footage is excellent and extremely rare and perhaps from a somewhat dangerous part of the world. I Thank you for providing this insightful video.",1294617600,,302,4.9411764705882355
8430012,5,B004I43LXW,"This dvd is packed with information on the Thai keris and has tons of
beautiful pictures of blades and sheaths, which are used along the knife.
It starts with a general overview of the most famous Thai bare knuckle systems like muay Korat and muay chaiya and takes us south to the Thai province of Yala where the village and the master are presented.
It's rare material, I had never heard of this not even when in Thailand so it's
a good opportunity to know more about the system and the different usage of the keris in a neutral light-which doesn't happen often.
All in all, it's a learning experience, the dvd has to be viewed more than once in order to process all the information and to further the learning following the different reference sources that are given.

Highly recommended to martial artists and to anyone interested in different cultures.",1294617600,,856,4.66887417218543
