1992229,5,B0001DMUHM,"Great cast featuring all actors, no musicians or rap stars with a great story and comedy delivery from the actors.  I think it was well written, well shot, and just all out a great movie.  I saw it the first weekend it came to Atlanta, GA, and me being an aspiring film maker I was very impressesed.  I hope to see more African-American movies like this.",1079568000,2,354,4.333333333333333

1992251,5,B0001DMUHM,I enjoy this movie because it reminded me of my life when I was in my thirties.  This is one of the those movies that I watch over and over again.  The cast is great.  The story line is great.  I enjoy seeing black people who are successful and beautiful.,1360281600,,255,4.04
1992252,4,B0001DMUHM,Good movie to watch with friends. Erika Alexander's character was allot different from other characters she's played giving the movie a great deal of dept.,1327276800,,155,5.24

1992254,5,B0001DMUHM,"I'll echo the sentiments of many others when I say, this movie was a very pleasant surprise.  It is an intelligent movie that is clearly made by a young black professional, about young black professionals, and featuring young black professionals.  Now to be honest, I saw this movie when it aired on TV One.  I immediately came to Amazon to get a sense of whether it was worth watching.  I was a tiny bit skeptical when I saw the movie cover (looks a little low budget, eh?) and very, very skeptical when I saw Tracy Morgan in the cast list (because his bumbling minstrel schtick on 30 Rock and in his own show IRKS me to no end!), but -- this movie was fantastic!  So realistic.  So well done.  So poignant.  So relatable.  The characters were well-developed and nuanced, and the story was actually well-told (take notes, Tyler Perry, take notes!  To be a full-length movie, the acting by these well-known sitcom actors (e.g. the mom from Fresh Prince, ""Cousin Pam""/""Maxine"" from the Cosby Show/Living Single, etc. -- and even Tracy Morgan) is spot-on!

THIS is the kind of movie that I want to see more of in the theaters. Let's have less of the cross-dressing men, the gang-banging ""keeping it real"" nonsense, and the rehash of the same old ""urban"" romantic comedy featuring four familiar faces -- and more like ""30 Years to Life."" In the meantime though, this is a perfect movie for a date night (because it has both the guys' and girls' perspectives), a perfect movie for a girls night in (because it will give you tons of intelligent, knowing laughs and lots to think about as well), and a good movie for those days when it's nothing but you, the remote, and a pint of icecream.",1317945600,,1684,4.561461794019934

1992256,5,B0001DMUHM,"I really enjoyed this movie!  The movie deals with real life issues with relationships, life, and love.  I am 27 and I am approaching that 30 year old mark and I can definitely identify with the movie 110%.  I can watch this movie over and over and not get bored.  I would recommend this movie because it is a great entertaining and romantic comedy!!!  Two thumbs up!",1184889600,,367,4.417910447761194
1992257,5,B0001DMUHM,When I first saw this movie I wasn't impressed but I began to appreciate it more and more as I watched it several times.  I find it to be very funny.  Someone forgot to cover the actor's mark in the scene where the couple is at the hotel.  If you are careful you might find yourself or people you know in this movie.  Enjoy.,1184716800,,324,4.015625
1992258,3,B0001DMUHM,Maybe I was expecting something else.  This movie I gave away after watching it.  Perhaps becuase I'm over 40 I simply was not moved by it. But for those who are approaching that societal age of 30 I imagine it would be enjoyable.,1183248000,,230,4.325581395348837
1992259,4,B0001DMUHM,"I agree with Nightscope, this movie can be a model for what average African American movies lovers like to see. Funny yet poignant view of tangible life changes for a young adult.  A good buy!",1174521600,,192,4.485714285714286
1992260,4,B0001DMUHM,I enjoyed this movie. There were many interesting subtopics to look at. I am 29 pushing 30 lol in about 10 months. I could relate.,1152748800,,130,4.24
1992261,4,B0001DMUHM,"I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. AS A FIFTY PLUS  MALE; I FIND IT DELIGHTFUL TO SEE YOUNG BLACK ACTORS PERFORMING AS INTELLIGENT RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS. THE CHALLENGES THEY FACED IN THIS MOVIE CONTRAST THE ""GUN CARRYING, TRYING TO GET OVER THUGS"" THAT HOLLYWOOD SEEMS TO PUSH AS BLOCKBUSTERS. I DID'T APPROVE OF THE PROFANITY NOR THE CAUSAL SEX SCENES. BUT, THIS MOVIE IS CERTAINLY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.",1141862400,2,402,4.911764705882353
1992262,5,B0001DMUHM,"Wow! What a really great movie! Expect really great acting from Erica Alexander, Allen Payne, Tracy Morgan, really the entire cast. A group of friends deal with the range of emotions from turning 30 years old. From crying at the birthday candles to quitting your job, to chase the elusize dream of your youth. This is a great movie, my husband and I really identified with it.",1136764800,5,376,4.626865671641791
1992263,2,B0001DMUHM,"I actually got this movie when it came out and I paid like $20 something for it. When I watched it I was very disappointed. I really got it to see all the good actors in it. It goes to show just because there is good actors in a movie doesn't mean it will be a good script or movie because of that fact. I thought it would be more in-depth with the characters but it wasn't. You have Tracy Morgan as a struggling comedian who is a promiscuous person who brings no real depth to the story, although he was funny. Then you have the sexy Allen Payne who plays a pretty boy who sleeps with a lot of women but no depth. See where I'm going here? Out of the whole movie I only believed Erika Alexander's character. It just looks like a movie that was put together without much thought to a real plot. I didn't get it, not one of the best movies, needless to say I took the movie back and got a credit for the amount I paid for it. I gave it 2 stars because sexy Allen Payne was in it.",1114732800,5,978,3.9444444444444446
1992264,4,B0001DMUHM,"This movie was good.  I wish that it had a larger audience.  Tracey Morgan was superb and very funny.  Please support it on DVD, since it could not be supported in the movies.",1088380800,5,175,4.242424242424242
1992265,1,B0001DMUHM,"I don't know what to say.  My cousin told me that she had this movie she'd never heard of and after watching it, I now see why!  This is a film about friends embarking on their 30th birthdays, their lives and what they haven't accomplished.  Marriage, Weight loss, Career goals.... shoot I'm 31 and trust me it's always going to be a point in your life that you're questioning yourself about something!  I wouldn't spend my money on it, and yes it's African American and ya'll know I'm all like support your people.",1088208000,4,515,4.505376344086022
1992266,5,B0001DMUHM,"... & 30 and I will meet face to face!  I loved films where the characters relate to you & friends. I am Natalie 100%.  I have traveled down her path & felt her pain!  I also know a ""Joy"" (she just got married after being with her boyfriend for about 15 years, granted some of those years were junior high & high school!), a Malik (damn him!) & a Stephanie (working from the outside in vs. the inside out).  I cannot wait to purchase the accompanying book - 100 things you should know before turning 30. Check out the 30yearstolife.com site for teh exact title.  I will ""pull a Natalie"" when I turn 30, but I know that I am in great company!",1086566400,2,641,4.137096774193548
1992267,2,B0001DMUHM,"The best thing about this movie was Tracy Morgan, everyone else in here can not act past a sitcom.
Ok, so what you turned 30, so did I but I did not go through this nosense and nobody else I knew did either. This movie was the only depressing thing about turning 30.
Later!!!!",1086048000,5,276,4.12962962962963
1992268,5,B0001DMUHM,"30 Years to Life is a cute romantic comedy that follows the lives of six African American friends as they approach thirty years old in New York City.  The cast consists Allen Payne, Tracy Morgan, Kadeem Hardison, Erica Alexander, Paula Jai Parker, T. Russell and Melissa De Sousa.  As you can tell from the cast names and if you know their filmographies...then you know that all of these people can really act.  So they have taken and crafted each character into a believable individual that most will be able to identify with.
The movie covers the span of one year.  It begins with a birthday celebration and ends with one.  You get an inside view of what women want in a relationship and also what men want.  It is hilarious as the characters portray the most shallow to something of substance.  Sometimes all that we think we want in a person (outer trappings like money, career, good looks)...does not enhance the inner person (inner qualities like politeness, caring, considerate, loving, giving and unselfishness).  Paula's character deals with being a great person inside (and a great cook), but overlooked by most men because she is overweight.  She has an extreme make over which takes her on an enlightening journey to get the man of her dreams.  Tracy's character seems to be a non-committal jerk, trying to break into the comedy business and bumming money from women...but later he reveals why a broke brother does what he does (a self-esteem kinda thing...issues).  Erika's character  lives with her boyfriend of four years.  She wants to get married, but he does not.  He goes to buy her a bracelet and is accidently given another customer's ring purchase.  So he does not have the heart to tell his girlfriend that their engagement was a mistake, fake, crazy mix-up...this was deep.  Allen's character quits a good job to follow his dream of being a model.  He is also a womanizer that has left a trail of loved them & left them.  He is forced to see the damage that his one night stands causes to women with good intentions.  Melissa's character discovers that one must be careful what they pray for because you just might get it...and it might not be a pretty picture.
In the course of one year each character grows older, but will they grow wiser and more mature?  I enjoyed this one and highly recommend it. Paula & Tracy really came out of the box with their performances and I look forward to more from them in the future.",1081987200,17,2443,4.676814988290398
1992269,5,B0001DMUHM,"This movie is great! I saw it in NY and was laughing from start to finish. It is a MUST have for anyone who is about to turn 30.  I have 3 friends turning 30 this year, and several more right on the outskirts of turning 30, I plan to buy this movie for all of them! This movie is so true to what getting older and leaving your 20's is all about!
Watch for the toe scene, the ring scene, and the ""what's that noise"" scene -  They all will have you dying laughing.",1079568000,3,462,3.8526315789473684
8010841,5,B0001DMUHM,"Really enjoyed this movie. The cast was wonderful. This movie as well as movie called ""Commitments"" I was lucky enough to purchase from Amazon. Both of these movies starred Allen Payne, and were directed and written by African American women. I think they both did excellent jobs on these films. Please purchase these are two gem movies that you can't really find anymore.",1504137600,,372,4.920634920634921

8010843,5,B0001DMUHM,"Very smart film for the ""middle"" aged.  Timberlands touch with music is an added bonus.  Tracy Morgan is as serious as I've ever seen him.  Loved him in Death at a Funeral too but this film was less about comedy and more about real life.  Great casting, loved all the actors and their rolls.  Paula Jai Parker proved she does not have to take her clothes off and still be interesting.  Great film.",1437696000,,397,4.36986301369863

8010850,4,B0001DMUHM,"I'm a fan of ensemble movies (movies with a variety of major cast members) so I was pleased to come across this flick. I'm not usually a fan of comedies, however, preferring thriller/suspense types. But when I need a little break, movies like this get the job done. Pretty decent story lines and acting. Funny situations with some relationship drama mixed in. Not a perfect script but it kept my attention, and if it came on TV in a year or two I'd probably watch it again.",1379030400,,473,4.448275862068965
