8620245,5,B000JMKI4M,"A fun shoot-em-up with lots of good chase scenes and a few good plot twists. One of the things that make the movie is Arnold going around strait faced and like the terminator without the metal endoskeleton.

Thoroughly rotten bad guy and drug dealer Viktor Rostavile `Rosta' (Ed O'Toss) flees the USSR after encountering Capt. Ivan Danko `USSR State Police'. We find that he has big plans in Chicago where he plans to do a deal with Abdul Elijah `incarcerated Revolutionary political leader' (Brent Jennings). Abdul has an agenda of his own. Everyone's plans must be adjusted as Danko turns up in Chicago and teams up with Det. Sgt. Art Ridzik `Chicago Police Dept.' (James Belushi) to track down and retrieve Rosta.

In the process of tracking we meet all kinds of dangerous criminals and beautiful women. Ridzik almost gets killed because of his instant affinity with a blond wayward nurse; he is in for a surprise. We also have the obligatory vehicle chase scene with a different twist.

Aside from the main players there are quite a few recognizable character actors which add significantly the movie.

THE RUNNING MAN (1987) - Arnold Schwarzenegger, Maria Conchita-Alonzo, Yaphet Kotto, Jim Brown, Jesse Ventura, Mick Fleetwood, Dweezil Zappa, Richard Dawson

Based on a Stephen King novel and set in the year 2017, here a bored and bloodthirsty society gets their vicarious thrills watching a to-the-death ""game"" between convicts and a team of bizarrely outfitted hunters.

RED HEAT (1988) - Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Belushi, Peter Boyle, Ed O'Ross, Laurence Fishburne, Gina Gershon

Walter Hill dud has Schwarzenegger miscast as a Russian cop sent to Chicago so he can capture an on-the-run drug kingpin. He's teamed temporarily with Belushi, and there's zero chemistry between them. Naturally, these two enforcers from opposite sides of a then starting to lift Iron Curtain immediately clash, but they put aside their differences and work together to nab the bad guy. This one's strictly for Arnold diehards (no wait... that's a Bruce Willis movie!)",1296950400,4,1549,6.847715736040609
