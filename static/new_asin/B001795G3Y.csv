8644315,1,B001795G3Y,The premise of this movie is great but the movie itself is terrible.  Almost unwatchable.,1215820800,,89,4.933333333333334
8644316,4,B001795G3Y,"I'm 40 and have been in 3 leagues over the last number of years and wondered what took so long for someone to finally make a comedy about this?
Kudos for capturing the stupid personalities that have been in every league I know of.
Worthwhile 90 min of entertainment if you play the game, and enjoy some of the stupid stuff that goes along with it.
The Good: Wally, Movie quotes, the TV station girl, waiting to see what happened to the losers each week.
The Bad:  Some scenes too long, some of the audio quality
For maximum enjoyment, watch this by yourself or with others who play the game. You'll miss too many laughs if you have to explain the scenes to someone else.",1209686400,,670,4.36
