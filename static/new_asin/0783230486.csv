65396,4,0783230486,"I saw the movie on TV and it is just really refreshing from most of the movies nowadays.  It's one of the movies that posts a bunch of questions up in the air and tells the answers at the end.  I think it's about this girl  college student play by Ryder who isn't sure about what she's going to do  about her love.  And she is writing this paper on her aunts, parents,  basically the people in the quilt group.  And I guess she finds the answer  after she heard all the experiences from her quilting friends.  It's  something about commiting to love, gradual learning of life.  I like the  theme.  I read the book too and it's pretty good too but the good thing of  the movie is that it organzied the novel into a story, and what a girl  learned from it.  THe book is all scattered and seperated into short  stories of each of the ladies in the quilt club, but it lets the readers  analysis and think about it all on your own.  They are both good.",962064000,5,947,4.132596685082873
65397,2,0783230486,this film tries to tell to many stories all at once but doesn't do any of the Characters justice. Alfre Woodard does a good solid job. Maya Angelou deserved better than playing second string to Winona Ryder.whose role is  rather bland here.,952819200,3,240,4.714285714285714
65398,5,0783230486,"This movie is one of the best that I've ever seen. It's almost like ""The Joy Luck Club"" as it dives into each character's life story.
The story isn't left with any gaping holes. Of course there are a few  questions that you want to ask, but I'm sure that those are answered in the  book, which I've never read.
It's a great chick flick to show with a  group of friends, at a sleepover, or by yourself.
Unfortunately, I have  found that it isn't the best date movie, or the best movie to watch with  most males.
But you can always watch it with mom, because the  Mother-Daughter relationship is a key theme of this movie.",945993600,7,620,4.256410256410256

Unfortunately, it seems to be grossly misunderstood by reviewers, who tend to be - and sorry for the generalization - male.  It  works more as a companion piece to the novel, as each fills in the blanks  that the other left behind.  What you have at the end is solid, heartfelt,  and a true treasure within the ""woman's film"" genre.",944524800,11,428,4.222222222222222

65401,2,0783230486,"Review of How to Make an American Quilt
Hot Toasty Rag, July 25, 2017

Ill save you some time. Gents, feel free to skip this movie. Based off the Whitney Otto novel, How to Make an American Quilt shows the audience a confused woman and the journey she takes to find herself as she talks to the women in her knitting group. If you like those kinds of girl power movies like Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood or Fried Green Tomatoes, youll definitely want to watch this one.

I don't happen to like those kinds of movies, so despite the large castWinona Ryder, Afre Woodard, Jean Simmons, Anne Bancroft, Ellen Burstyn, Maya Angelou, and Kate NelliganI didn't like this movie. Many women will find this movie touching and heartwarming, but it did nothing for me. The overriding theme is that every woman is a patchwork product of the other women in her life, so when we choose our path of love, its not really because were choosing it; its because all the other womens experiences in love have taught us and shaped us. Ive never been a huge fan of estrogen-fest films, but if you like them, rent this one with your girlfriends.",1500940800,,1129,4.529411764705882

65417,3,0783230486,"Personally I found the lead played by Winona Ryder to be lacking in depth. Maybe another actress would have given the story more umph, but quite frankly, if it wasn't for the rest of the supporting cast, it never would have made it.

As far as stories go, there's more bad stories of marriages than good ones.  The ""soulmate"" of one of the ladies is a married man who writes a poem and gives it to her....""Young lovers seek perfection.  Old lovers learn the art of sewing shreds together and of seeing beauty in a multiplicity of patches.""  That pretty much sums up the movie.  Basically you cheat or your husband cheats or both of you do, but in the end, you decide to stay together. OR you lose yourself along the way, and your husband leaves you.  OR you are married to your soulmate, and he dies. So you find comfort in the arms of your best friend's husband...  Blah blah blah...Yada yada yada.  I cannot believe this story was made into a movie.

I give it 2.5 stars.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. I don't regret seeing it, but I won't be watching it again.",1469664000,,1082,4.365

65436,5,0783230486,"Beautiful movie about love, marriage, relationships, and what it all means. I can relate to Finn in so many ways. I read the book afterward, and they followed it to a T.  The man is incredible. I can't think of any woman or half-way sensitive man who wouldn't enjoy this. The movie is a conglomeration of each character's ""love story"", which they then weave into a quilt piece. Just a classic. And Maya Angelou - what a gem. All-star cast. Plus, any movie with Thomas Newman's compositions (American Beauty, Shawshank, Revolutionary Roadl, etc.) is always a winner. The music ALONE is worth the watch. But, no, really. So many movies nowawadays are total crap. I wish they still made movies like these because I SO miss going to the movies or movie night in.

65510,4,0783230486,I like how this story goes from present to past. How the ladies tell thier stories through the quilt while in a sense advising the younger generation. How we hang to bad feelings and grudges and how fleeting the good is. And how when you come to a point in your life when enough is enough. This is in a sense a coming of age story but from the older generation.,1385942400,2,361,4.098591549295775

65522,5,0783230486,"The first time I had news about what was a quilt, became as a shock when I decided to go to a workshop about making your mandala (that's the name of each part of a quilt for other people)with a purpose that was only yours. For me it was like impossible mission because my world goes around numbers and nothing about art. One day a partner came with this film that was totally in line with our work. I finished my mandala and I took photos and asked family and friends to do the same when we present our quilt (with all the mandalas)...just in case one day it seemed to me that was a dream that I have had.

The film leads me to look for this art in USA and it is just great!

A very beautiful film, enchanting and above all the theme: where love resides...oh! Everybody (men and women) is going to enjoy it. Believe me. In adition: great performances. Ivonne from Uruguay",1369785600,,871,4.209580838323354

65536,5,0783230486,"The service was great. got the movie in a timely manner. I love this movie. So many women are faced with this choice...some choose their best friends and some chose their lovers... Choosing your best friend is the best choice. But that doesn't mean those who chose their lover cannot have their lover as their best friend. If you chose your lover then figure out a way to get close to them. Become their best friend. You'll have a satisfying life if you do. Relationships are hard and they are work so take your time and be patient, there is a right person for you. This movie also hit the home on women and their relationships with their mothers. Bottom line... if you don't have a good relationship with your mother chances are you will likely have difficulties in all other relationships. Therapy, self-examination and loving friendships can lead you on the right track. But a permanent and forever road to keep you alive and well mentally and physically is God Jehovah thru his beautiful letter that he gave us. His word the bible. He comforts us and helps us to cope with these difficult life altering decisions and relationships that are out of our reach to fix. No therapist or self-help book could support you internally like God. Though the movie does not mention God, the 2 most important relationships humans can have can only be truly fullfilling and succesful if you allow Jehovah God to be apart of it!",1352332800,,1416,4.645418326693227

65546,5,0783230486,"For years, we watched our old VCR version over and over, but finally we have the DVD, which is far superior, with wide screen, better color and resolution,  Dolby 5.1 sound, but many extras such as bios of the stars (Winona Ryder, Ann Bancroft, Jean Simmons, and Ellen Burstyn) and how a thesis became the novel.  Whitney Otto's book was marvelously captured by Australian film maker Jocelyn Moorhouse.  Finn Dodd (Winona Ryder)sometime in the 1970s is trying to write a thesis while her ""intended"" is busting up and remodeling their house, so she goes to ""Grass, CA"" to live with her grandmother where she learns the lives of the closely knit friends and relatives in a ""quilting bee"" when they were Finn's age.  So you see two stories, the older ladies stories with ""flashback footage"" by younger actors, but in 1930's homes, clothes, etc. about their young adult lives as they make their best quilt, ""The Story of Love,"" a gift for Finn, and her quest to both finish her thesis and marry.  Winona Ryder and the older actresses all gave marvelous performances.  The different generations are also tied together by two important crows, who bring two sets of lovers together.",1306022400,,1175,4.82089552238806
65547,5,0783230486,Came in the mail very quickly. Have always loved this movie. The title doesn't make you think its such a good story about different kinds of love.,1297814400,,146,4.444444444444445
65548,5,0783230486,"I half expected that How to Make an American Quilt would make me cry, but I never thought that I would start crying in the opening sequence, before anything even happened. They just showed some quilts with the patterns echoed in the rows of crops in the California farmland, and a flashback of Finn Dodd (Winona Ryder) as a young girl at her grandmother's quilting bee. Though How to Make an American Quilt made me cry, it was a good cry. The kind of cry that cleanses all the hairy and troubling emotions you've been burdened with. There was laughter as well. The kind that comes from seeing the all too human and recognizable quirks we all share. Closely observed by the writers, novelist Whitney Otto and screenwriter Jane Anderson, and well played by the excellent cast, especially the older women. Director Jocelyn Moorhouse could sew a quilt and call it How to Make an American Film. She takes the imagery and symbolism of the quilt and carries it through the film, and in a broader sense the intertwining lives of the women in the quilting bee also form a quilt or a tapestry. Well written, well directed, and well played.

Winona Ryder was in her element here. The only thing she stole, however, was my heart. It is almost her trademark to play characters who write, and this was no exception. She is a Berkeley student trying to write a thesis, and has attempted to write several, but always abandons them before the end. She is off chasing another topic, like her free spirited mom, who couldn't stay true to one guy. This time she is writing about tribal traditions of women, and tying it into her grandmother's quilting circle.

While her live-in boyfriend Sam (Dermot Mulroney) is finishing work on the fixer-upper they share in the city, she will spend the summer on her grandmother's farm, finishing her thesis. Though Sam seems to be solid husband material with plans to settle down with Finn and have kids, Finn balks. Like her mother, she has commitment issues. Spending the summer apart is like sending a kleptomaniac to Saks. What were they thinking? Though she should have been put on probation Winona is especially adorable as she is semi-reluctantly involved in a flirtation with a local named Leon (Johnathon Schaech) she meets at the community pool. Those beguiling doe's eyes--not even the arresting officers could resist their charm. Leon's family grows strawberries, and later he will tempt her with freshly picked strawberries, still warm from the sun, all the more enticing for being forbidden fruit.

It is at the pool where Finn starts to learn more about her grandmother's and great aunts' past lives. Constance (Kate Nelligan), who now scares small children, was once a diver. She had a striking figure that drove the men wild. Constance may be bitter, but she was once so sweet, and her various regrets give her every reason. How to Make an American Quilt jumps back and forth in flashbacks and current time. All of the women have interesting stories, and as American Quilt unfolds, we learn their secrets. Great Aunt Glady Joe Cleary (Anne Bancroft) is Mrs. Robinson! Well, I mean, she played Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate, and we have actors of that caliber; in American Quilt they are even more experienced and have honed their talent to an even sharper point. Ellen Burstyn plays Finn's Grandmother Hy Dodd, and the two sisters share a secret about Glady Joe's husband Arthur, played by Rip Torn, real name Elmore Rual Torn. Rip Torn really lived up to his name when he was found sprawled on the floor of the Litchfield Bancorp building in his hometown of Salisbury late at night, clutching a loaded revolver while reportedly drunk. He told cops he thought the building was his home. Luckily, the actor's troubles didn't prevent him from turning in a stunning performance in American Quilt.

The poet Maya Angelou plays Anna, who is the leader of the quilting circle, and her daughter Marianna is played by Alfre Woodard. Marianna has lived in Paris where she received marriage proposals in at least five different languages, but she never wanted to be tied down to one man. She met one poet who she thought was her soul mate, but he was already married, and all he left her was a poem on a scrap of paper: ""Young lovers seek perfection. Old lovers learn the art of sewing shreds together and of seeing beauty in a multiplicity of patches."" Anna and Marianna add a lot of color sense, not only to the quilt, but to the stories of the women who sew the quilt. There is such a thing as a story quilt, and Anna has one that tells of how her mother followed a crow that led her to her true love. The crow was the one key symbol that was woven into the fabric of How to Make an American Quilt that made it whole. Who wants to bet that Finn will eventually follow a crow of her own, wrapped in a quilt, and that will wrap up How to Make an American Quilt?

65560,5,0783230486,"I have seen the movie and subsequently read the book, years ago. They are both distinct entities. The movie is a ""feel-good"" movie, with ""satisfying"" painful moments and happy ones.

  It is a great challenge for movie directors to do justice to books made into movies, because they are completely two distinct art forms. Movies made from books generally are an entity of their own, which can be a total delight if done well.  Not only can they enhance the book, they can totally bring it to life in a very memorable way.  This one meets that test, as does (in my opinion) ""Cold Mountain""  and ""Fried Green Tomatoes"".

  The most satisfying aspect of this movie for me is the recurrent theme of forgiveness.  Each of the main characters faces a situation where forgiveness is desperately needed, either from someone else or themselves.  That's what this movie is really all about for me.  We all need forgiveness for our mistakes, which we don't always get.  That's why it's nice to watch it happen for someone else.  Thank you to the makers of this movie.

65564,4,0783230486,"One of things about Jocelyn Moorhouse films (PROOF,THE THOUSAND ACRES) is that she knows how to direct scripts that include a multitude of characters that have their own individual stories -which is not always an easy task to accomplish. Moorhouse succeeds brilliantly! The screenplay which was adapted from Whitney Otto's novel tells a tender story of 26 year old Finn (Winina Ryder) and the seven women who have been a part of her life off and on since early childhood. These women have been meeting regularly over at least thirty years in order to make quilts. The magic in making a quilt is ""the ability to make the right choices which enhance the other colours,whereas the wrong choices dull the quilt.""The end purpose of the quilt is in ""seeing beauty in a multiplicity of patches."" Throughout this touching and almost magical film filled with poignant performances uniformly,the women devulge their collective life choices one by one to Finn who,not certain of her path in life or her certainty in marrying her fiance,learns from these older women how to possibly choose rightly in all areas in her own life. Each woman has a deep tale of love,desire,betrayal,jealousy,anger and heartbreak,yet each has survived to learn some lessons about love and forgiveness, and it is these life lessons which become the patchwork quilt that they give to Finn. The conclusion:""life has no rules to follow:go by instinct:be brave.""

This really is an excellent film and the ever brilliant Thomas Newman has once again composed a heartfelt score to weave into this delicate piece of art. This movie is so reminscent of other films such as STEEL MAGNOLIAS,THE DIVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD and THE JOY LUCK CLUB that deal with the ""collective conscience"" of an ensemble of women who are indelibly connected to aid a younger struggling woman.

I personally am not fond of  the label ""chick flick"" being attached to films such as this. AMERICAN QUILT is a story that teaches life lessons to all people about choices and the learning and maturing process that all humans undergo. Perhaps the most interesting character in this film is that of the tortured artist Dean,husband to one of the women. It is through Dean that we see that men are figures too with sensitivies who make the same mistakes and wrong choices that women do,and yet still have the same capacity and need for love and forgiveness.

The film constantly flips back and forth from the past to the present,but Jocelyn Moorhouse keeps every story clear and each character identified and in focus, as well as keeping the films themes ever before us.",1175990400,4,2610,4.925
65565,4,0783230486,"The POINT of the story is that love is often imperfect but it is up to each person to decide to salvage the good in a relationship.  The main plot is that Winona's character, Finn, is recently engaged but she has a problem committing - not only to her fiance, but to a topic for her thesis, and so on.  She's got some misconceptions about what life and love are about. She goes to spend the summer with her grandmother and great aunt; the women of their quilting bee see her confusion and open up to her about their own experiences with love.  Every story involves pain, most involve infidelity.  However, these women show Finn how they have patched together a life of contentment, i.e. a patchwork quilt.

The quilts in the movie are beautiful; however, not a lot is said about quilting.  It's basically the motif.  The bonuses that I have are not worth paying extra for - cast bios (I mean, if you are reading this, you could fine more online) and a few notes about the production.  I was disappointed that there was not much information on the quilts and quilters that worked on them; I know I've seen articles on it here or there.  I think this is one of the few movies where, if you like it, you probably REALLY would have enjoyed the director commentary, on things like the quilts, the locations, the era, the actors, etc.

Winona Ryder is the weakest actor in this movie; the rest of the ensemble in incredible, especially Ellen Burstyn, Anne Bancroft, Alfre Woodard, and Maya Angelou; there are also many great actors in small parts (Clare Danes, Samantha Mathis, Joanna Going, Dermot Mulroney, Kate Capshaw...).

Actually, it did remind me of this one where there's a boy in a plastic breathing bubble. Can't recall it's exact name, but it starred a young John Travolta and had a heartbreaking song at the end of it. The lyrics were something like: ""What would you say, if I up and ran away ... "" as he rides away on a horse with the love interest .. who was that redhead who was in a ton of stuff in the 70s but I don't recall her name or if she's been in anything since then.

65568,3,0783230486,"Talented cast, discernable effort invested in meaningful performances, but in the end How To Make An American Quilt was more of a montage of scenes than a cohesive movie. In my opinion it would have succeeded more than it did had it been shot as a collection of short stories wrapped around its theme, with several unifying characters present throughout each story. Mostly the stories these women tell here are bitter. The prettiest girl in town, an Olympic-caliber swimmer, falls for a rogue and is left deserted to raise her children. A black girl falls in love with a rich white boy, becomes pregnant, and is banished by his family, never to see him again. I did like how it flashed back into the lives of the older women, especially the time it showed the fiery young womanizing artist of the mid-twentieth-century filling his canvases with wild brush strokes, a solidly attractive young man at the top of his world, and then in the next few moments it showed him in the 1990's as this worn-down old man, physically and psychically dependant on the wife he'd been painting in the flashback, and on whom he'd cheated so egregiously. I guess if you're going to see this film about the life stories and love stories of a group of ordinary/extraordinary American women, enjoy it as it unfolds but don't look for a deep message, because I don't think one truly exists under the illusion that it does.",1159488000,2,1399,4.691056910569106

65578,4,0783230486,"How To Make An American Quilt is quite a charming film. Being largely set amongst sunny Californian orange orchards, there is a wonderfully warm feel about the cinematography, and an excellent (largely female) ensemble cast who make the most of the poignant story and genteel script. The flowing direction of the piece is the work of Australia's own Jocelyn Moorhouse.

Winona Ryder plays Finn Dodd, a recently betrothed twenty-six year old Berkeley postgraduate student who is trying to finish her Masters thesis - for the third time. Finn decides to spend the summer at her Grandmother's house, leaving her new fianc, Sam (Dermot Mulroney), to continue the renovations on their home. Ostensibly she is going there to get some peace and quiet, but in reality she is looking for something more. The film follows Finn's mental quest for clarity on her role as a woman and reassurance about her future as a wife.

Her Grandmother Hy (Ellen Burstyn) and great-Aunt Glady (Anne Bancroft) are the mainstays of the Grasse quilting bee, a group of like-minded women who spend their time making beautiful quilts. In the USA, quilting is close to an art form and some quilts can be worth considerable sums of money, but the film gives the impression that the quilts created by this group are much more about companionship than money. Finn has largely grown up around these older ladies, since her mother, a divorced hippie, couldn't control her wanderlust for long enough to provide a stable home. This is the place where, surrounded by the love of this extended family, Finn feels at her most secure.

Finn soon finds a suitable diversion from her writing when a chance meeting with a handsome young stranger, Leon (Johnathon Schaech), tests her fidelity and reinforces her doubts about marrying Sam. As the summer unfolds, Finn watches as the ladies design and sew the panels for her wedding quilt. The theme of the quilt is where love resides, and each of the panels reflects the life and loves of its creator. In a series of vignettes, the formative experience of love for each woman is retold - each of them providing a slightly different different perspective on the true meaning of love. Amongst the many stories, we learn the reason behind the enmity between Hy and Glady, details of Anna's (Maya Angelou) one true love, the cause of Sophia's (Lois Smith) bitterness and the origins of Constance's (Kate Nelligan) affair with Em's husband . Before the summer ends, and Sam returns, Finn must decide for herself what is important in her own life, and whether or not to proceed with her wedding...

How To Make An American Quilt is not quite a classic, but it is very good. The theme is simple - how love affects us in different ways, and how we deal with the consequences - but it is still a thought-provoking piece. The mini-stories feel a little too short and perhaps the film might have had more impact by developing fewer of them with more depth. Less is more, as they say. Nevertheless, the excellent cast all put in performances of the highest calibre. Most of the performances are wonderfully subdued - there is a strong air of melancholy which pervades the piece, and more than a hint of sadness in many of the stories. It won't quite have you reaching for the tissues, but it is touching nonetheless. The cinematography is frequently beautiful and the ambience of each flashback story is conveyed flawlessly. Well worth a rental, and for fans of any of the main cast, this may be worth adding to your collection.",1107129600,7,3519,4.792421746293246
65579,3,0783230486,"Creaking with metaphors, it is a lovely story to watch, with a knockout cast well-skilled in ensemble acting. But it plods along, documenting the making of a wedding quilt that incorporates the lives of each person who contributes to it. Finn Dodd, played by Ryder, at her tentative and mysterious best, is spending the summer with her aunts, while finishing her thesis. She is also engaged to Sam, who seems to get needier, as Finn seems to be getting coldfeet. The quilt is a gift for Finn's wedding, and is a labor of love among a group of women whose lives are intertwined in the northern California wine country, each of them sewing a panel that expresses the theme, ""Where love resides."" But love resides in many different places among these women - from sisters Glady Jo and Hy, entertainingly played by Bancroft and Burstyn, who are exactly the kinds of aunts anyone would like to have in their family, to the prickly Em, and the unconventional Constance. So many different stories, as interpreted in quilting panels, do not always make a pretty quilt, and much negotiating and compromise is the very nature of putting the quilt together, as it is in life. Not Ryder's best work, but Burstyn and Bancroft are delightful as the pot-smoking aunts, rockin' out to Neil Diamond's ""Cherry, Cherry."" Simmons is a pleasure to see - with quite a lengthy career behind her, she doesn't appear often. Samantha Mathis is always charming - it would be nice if things would really *click* for her career. Kate Nelligan is fabulous - I was never able to abide her work, presuming her to be like the kind of tight-assed, judgmental characters that she portrayed. But I unexpectedly caught her in ""Frankie and Johnny"" (with Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer), and could not believe I was watching the woman I had scorned for so long. Now I look forward to seeing her everytime she appears. In spite of many fascinating and multi-faceted characterizations, this vehicle does not serve any of these actresses well. One expects Greatness out of such an enormous and worthy cast, but the Entertain-o-meter stops short of Just Okay, and one wishes that such talent had been applied to a script that utilized their collective talent better. The concept of the story revolving around this group-effort is a fine concept, but director, Moorhouse, has to work hard to keep the story from fragmenting into oblivion. Though not weighing in as a heavyweight, the multitude of fine performances ensures that it is fine entertainment on a lazy day.",1106438400,4,2524,4.844907407407407

Finn is a graduate student who wants to spend the summer working on her thesis. She also needs a break from her boyfriend who wants to marry her. She's very indecisive about everything in her life, and I honestly found her part to be a little boring. The best parts of the story are about the friends that her grandmother and aunt share and their involvement in a quilting circle. The quilting ladies are all quite different and through flashbacks we're given a glimpse of them as young women and the love or lack of love in their lives. Jean Simmons plays one of the women, and I was delighted to see her acting again. I loved the scenes where the quilters, are working around a table in the lovely old house.  The set designs were beautiful and perfect for the story.
At a certain point in the film, we come to find out that the theme of the quilt is ""where love resides.""  Every quilter is making a block from her own experience in life.  Finn also learns that the quilt is her wedding gift.

It stars Winnona Ryder as Finn, a young woman about to be married, who is writing a thesis on the interpersonal relationships that are intertwined with in the making of an American quilt. The people that she is writing about are a group of women who have been quilting together for many, many years. They have assembled with the goal of creating a wedding quilt for Finn. The group is comprised of her grandmother, her aunt, and several of their oldest and closest friends. Each woman is charged with designing a single square of the quilt that represents for them ""where love resides"". As the women work on the quilt they use the opportunity to counsel Finn about her upcoming marriage. They give their own views on what is important in life; on what their experiences have taught them, and why they have made the choices in life that they have made. While they are together, working on the quilt you learn about the relationships and experiences that represent love for these women. At the same time you learn about the hardships and the tribulations that they have experienced both individually and within relationships with one another.  This is a movie that explores the nuances of family, love, birth, death, marriage and friendship. This exploration is handled beautifully. The separate stories are woven together, as their lives are, and as the pieces of the quilt are. The movie on the surface is a simple story of several women's lives and their experiences. As you watch, and look deeper you begin to understand that there is profound meaning and an explicit symbolism in each scene and every moment. Each part of this movie was thought out and carefully considered. It is a pleasure to watch and you find your self deeply involved with these women as you travel full circle in their lives.

65584,3,0783230486,"How to Make an American Quilt is a nice comfortable movie, and unlike so many other films belonging to the 'coming of age' genre, it doesn't leave the viewer feeling emotionally drained. It is also unusual in that it attempts to breach the generation divide in its appeal; however its success in this respect is debatable.
Finn is 26 and, hoping for some peace and quiet in which to complete her Master's thesis, she heads for her great-aunt's house in small-town Grasse, California. She also needs time to mull over a marriage proposal from her boyfriend. This is an entrance cue for a smoulderingly handsome strawberry farmer (in an unnecessary plot complication) to hinder Finn's contemplations.
Great-aunt Glady-Joe lives with her sister, Hy, and their constant bickering is portrayed with sensitivity and humour by Anne Bancroft and Ellen Burstyn. The two sisters belong to a quilting group, who are in the process of creating Finn's wedding quilt - thematically titled 'where love resides'. This evokes something different for each of the women, all of whom - in artificially contrived tete-a-tetes - explain to Finn the story behind their contributions to the quilt. The viewer is transported to a time when these elderly women were young, and through them we (along with Finn) learn that times may change, but affairs of the heart will always be unpredictable.
These dalliances in the past are refreshingly piquant; unfortunately this is countered by the film's occasional heavy-handedness. The symbolic crow that leads the women to their true love has all the subtlety of a flashing neon sign. Ultimately however, even if it does perhaps tie up the loose ends too thoroughly, the film will leave the viewer pleasantly satisfied.",1028592000,4,1737,5.098245614035088
65585,5,0783230486,"""How to Make an American Quilt"" is one of my favorite ""chick flicks.""  And hopefully labeling a movie as a ""chick flick"" doesn't immediately damn it into some lesser category.  When I want to curl up in a quilt on a rainy day and sip hot cocoa and watch a movie, ""American Quilt"" would be a perfect choice.  This is one of the few times when I liked the movie far better than the book--which I read second.  From the moment that I hear the first strains of the movie's soundtrack, I'm ready to grab a box of Kleenex and settle in.
In ""American Quilt,"" Finn (Winona Ryder) comes to spend the summer with her grandmother Hy (Ellen Burstyn) and great aunt Glady Jo (Anne Bancroft) in Grasse, California.  Her plan is to finish her master's thesis while considering the marriage proposal of her long-time sweetheart, Sam.  Finn's inability to stick with a project--she's changed thesis topics countless times--seems about to derail her relationship with Sam.  Amazon.com's main review criticizes the movie adaptation of the Whitney Otto novel for focusing too much on Finn.  I thought that Finn's attempt to sort out her feelings about relationships, while talking to the other women in Hy and Glady Jo's quilting group, sewed the story together quite well.  As Finn is pondering whether a modern, intelligent woman can preserve a sense of self within a marriage, one by one, her grandmother, aunt, and their friends share the stories of their marriages or their most significant relationships.  Older women sharing their life experiences to help guide a younger woman rang very true to life.
Poet Maya Angelou turns in a surprisingly powerful performance as the leader of the quilting group.  Her story of how, as an unwed mother, she came to work for Hy and Glady Jo's mother, is one of my favorites.  She holds her own with this great actresses.  Bancroft and Burstyn are wonderful as sisters whose love for each other has endured, despite betrayal.  Samantha Mathis, as the young Sophia Darling, is stellar as the diver who can't wait to shake off the dust of her small town and explore the world, and who discovers that realizing such dreams aren't so easy.
As a quilter, I absolutely loved the various quilts seen in the movie.  I appreciated the detail of including fabrics seen in the flashback scenes into the blocks that each woman contributes to the friendship quilt.  The quilts that Anna shows to Finn--including an old slave quilt that was especially designed and made for the movie and a baby quilt featuring African animals--are some of my favorite quilt designs.",1023321600,47,2575,4.818181818181818

65587,4,0783230486,"Firstly, I am a man reviewing this ""chick flick"". But, I was touched by the premise of the film without even knowing there was a book too. So, my review here is just about the film, not a film to book comparison.
I found the setting of the story, an agriculture region of California, beautiful, and the cinematography quite good. It is a pleasant and aesthetic picture for the eye.
The cast is dynamite, Ellen Burstyn, Maya Angelou, Anne Bancroft,
and all the others! The acting I found superb. Other reviewers who criticize Winona Ryder I do not agree with. I found Ryder's
acting and portrayal of a confused graduate student, not quite knowing what to do and where to go very credible, and quite believable! I felt the director of the movie was very true to the portrayal of this important point in one's life, where one has to decide who to spend the rest of their life with. I think many in our society don't really examine this aspect of our lives and I believe negative reviewers are those folk who have not experienced this maybe in their lives as of yet. I found the older characters reminiscing to their younger selves a powerful device, powerfully employed by the Director. It is quite easy to critique and blithely say the flashback device was over used. But, such analysis, does not give fair credit to the full employ of the flashback device use with a twist in this film. For me, it was a powerful message. The older women, still with that younger self as a component of their souls, was what the flashbacks were about.
 Truly, an erudite portrayal by all the actors and the director of how we ""quilt"" our love(s) into our lives. Highly recommended only for those who know the meaning of love in their lives and how difficult it can be at times to sort through that confusion. A poignant portrayal by all actors and kudos to Ryder for the confusion, anger, limbo, etc. of her character. I felt Winona demonstrated a virtuouso range, and those who do not recognize it, maybe have not experienced this range in their lives as of yet. The film is one that I would gladly watch again. I don't do that too often.",1006214400,39,2121,4.509090909090909

65589,3,0783230486,"This adaptation by screenwriter Jane Anderson (novel by Whitney Otto) presents us with a character named Finn Dodd (Ryder), a 26-year old college student who has just gotten engaged to her long-time sweetheart Sam (Mulroney).  She begins to realize the many changes that will come about because of her acceptance to his proposal and needs time to think and adjust. She decides to spend three months at her grandma Hy's house in Grasse, CA, which is the center of operations to a longtime quilting bee.  During her tenure, she continues working on her master's thesis (a project of which she continuously changes her topic), all the while listening to the quilting bee's romantic horror stories as they craft Finn's wedding quilt.
To sum it up, ""How To Make An American Quilt"" is the quintessential chick flick awash with many familiar faces including Maya Angelou.  The Pulitzer Prize-winning poet stars as Anna, the queen of an eight-member sewing circle consisting of Glady Jo Cleary (Anne Bancroft), Hy Cleary (Ellen Burstyn), her daughter Marianna (Alfre Woodard), Em Reed (Jean Simmons), Constance Saunders (Kate Nelligan) and Sophia Darling (Lois Smith).  Anna winds up in the Cleary household at 16 - pregnant, unmarried and helpless.  She will dwell there until the birth of her child, meeting Hy and Glady Jo for the first time.  Little does she know that these two young women will remain in her life for years afterward, their interest and skill in the art of quilting mounting over the years by Anna's guidance.
There is also the story of Hy and Glady Jo themselves and their unspoken bitterness towards each other - we learn that Hy is the reason for Glady Jo's ""self-expression"" all over the walls of the laundry room.  Then there is Sophia, an aspiring diver in her adolescence and later an abandoned mother of three; Em, wife to a histrionic artist, suffering his recurrent infidelity; Constance, a decent woman who endures the loss of her nearest and dearest, left with only her precious memories and Marianna, a lover of many but starved for the discovery of her soulmate.
We find as the film goes on that many instances of infidelity exist in the characters' cluttered histories.  Half the women in this movie commit adultery at some point and even Finn falls victim to temptation. Where as once I could not relate, I find myself agreeing with many of Finn's thoughts and opinions on marriage upon becoming engaged - this includes a question in the very beginning that Ryder's voiceover poses to the audience: ""How do you merge into this thing called `a couple', and still keep a little room for yourself?  How do we even know we're only supposed to be with one person for the rest of our lives?""  These kinds of questions number in the hundreds of intended couples as they come closer to walking the proverbial aisle.  I know that I have had my own reservations about marriage ever since I got engaged and many of my questions will never have an answer - I must trust my heart...and my gut.
Performances range in the areas of premium to mediocre.  Who comes at the top of my list are screen veterans (and Academy Award winners, natch) Ellen Burstyn and Anne Bancroft.  These two never cease to amaze me with how they can turn a character inside out and make it their own.  Winona Ryder is so-so (as she is in most of her movies) as Finn but she does manage to touch a few nerves with her dark and luminous eyes - those pretty peepers are half of her dramatic capacity.  Alfre Woodard is excellent, giving Marianna a carved edge but a soft core.  Kate Nelligan is also wonderful but if you really wanna see her flex those acting chops, take a deep breath of Lila Wingo in ""The Prince of Tides"".  Dermot Mulroney always seems to play a nice guy that gets taken for granted (The Thing Called Love, My Best Friend's Wedding, Point Of No Return, etc.) and he does it again here - actis repeatus, you might say.  Jean Simmons is a little disappointing as Em, the once beautiful and poised actress now only a shadow of herself.  Maya Angelou does fine as Anna and some of Gen X's more popular faces make brief appearances in supporting roles (Claire Danes, Samantha Mathis, Jared Leto and Jonathan Schaech).
This film is a fairly even script-to-screen production and will please many that seek a decent character study.  Of course, you can't outdo a detailed and poetic novel or the insightful author who writes it.  As long as novelists continue to exist and evolve, filmic adaptations cannot compare (though there are a few exceptions here and there, e.g. Dolores Claiborne).  This is not to say that ""How To Make An American Quilt"" isn't enjoyable - it's just not on par with what can be translated through literature.  For those who have read Otto's novel, it will earn your rigid criticism.",1001376000,10,4808,4.72488038277512
65590,4,0783230486,"Winona Ryder plays Finn Dodd who spends her summer with her grandmother. There she meets Grandma's sewing friends who start to make a quilt for her wedding day.
Each piece of the quilt is symbolic of the many stories they have to tell her. And each story teaches Finn something of love that will eventually help her deal with her own set of problems between the hunky Leon (played by Johnathon Schaech) she met while swimming, and her fiance whom she had a quarrel with.
Though somewhat fragmented at times (perhaps intended because of the quilt concept), this tale is rich with poetic imagery and thoughts about life, old age and the beauty of it.",997747200,,648,4.643478260869565
65591,2,0783230486,"This is the kind of movie that you see, and after you've seen it, realize you ought to have read the book instead. The characters were just too much for the director (or screenwriters) to handle.
This is the story of a young woman named Finn (Ryder), who is feeling overwhelmed by her university studies and commitment-ready boyfriend. To get away from it all, she spends the summer with her grandmother and aunt in a very small California town. Her grandmother, aunt and their quilting circle get together to make Finn's wedding quilt, and share stories of their past (and current) loves.
Some of the acting is quite good (e.g. Rowlands and Bancroft). Ryder is too languid to convey any real sense of suffering or anxiety. The women's stories are interesting, but lack depth. On the positive side, there is the nice use of flashbacks into different times and places; and I think this movie is just as much about how men relate to women as it is about women trying to deal with their men.
But overall, I was disappointed with the film. It is rather like a few intriguing patches being sewn into a pretty, but unimaginative quilt.",991008000,3,1129,4.65
65592,5,0783230486,"I rented this film not knowing what to expect except for Winona Ryder.  I loved the film and I'm a guy and I didn't find it sexist at all.  I bought the DVD and I watch  it all the time.  It gives a very honest look at the way some men can treat women, a very honest look.  I liked it because the quilt and the laundry room moral had such symbolism, and that's good to see.  If anyone reading this has the DVD and has found the theatrical trailer, email me and tell me.  I'm sure it's on there, I just haven't found it yet and I really want to see it.",977616000,6,551,3.8230088495575223
65593,4,0783230486,"Syrupy orgy of social and sexual need with a strong message and some redeeming artistic value, beautifully photographed.  It's sad to see Jean Simmons, who was once a fine actress as well as an intriguing, voluptuous beauty, reduced to this.  Ditto for the other Grand Dames here who fret about and wallow in their past loves while spying lustily on the loves of others.
I saw this to study Winona Ryder's face.  She plays Finn Dodd, a Berkeley grad student writing her thesis on the lives of the quilt makers while debating a marriage proposal.  Sometimes she seems to be posing, and at other times I find her as subtle and as natural as a great actress.  As beautiful as she is, I found myself wondering if her interpretation of a selfish and duplicitous young woman was more a projection of her own true heart than a demonstration of any acting skill.  She certainly doesn't give the slightest hint that she cares about the loves and heartaches of the quilt makers: she seems totally absorbed in present titillations and in the working out of the pre-matrimonial angst.  But it may be that that is the reality of who her character is, and if so Ryder plays her to a perfect fit.
Totally captivating is the scene in the orange grove where the 26-year-old Finn gets laid by mesomorphic Leon who provokes her to a swooning imitation of a Victorian maiden being touched for the first time.  (Winona's face is VERY sexy.)
In a sense the Darwinian nature of the human animals depicted here is correct, and on that level director Jocelyn Moorehouse is having a good laugh on all of us.  Her assertion is that what humans really practice is ""serial monogamy,"" an insight from evolutionary psychology increasingly accepted these days.  Her answer to the vexing question, ""Can men and women be friends?"" is clearly no.  From a woman's point of view-and this film is clearly from a woman's POV-I suspect she is correct.
The quilt symbolizes the human institutions and the social and political bonding that enable women to collar their animal nature and live in harmony with others.
Memorable are the oaks and the orange groves and the rolling hills of the California countryside; a black crow that hops; a wind devil that tumbles a white plastic chair and blows the pages of Finn's thesis out the door; and an old Ann Bancroft stoned on marijuana and cognac.",972432000,3,2350,4.7073170731707314
