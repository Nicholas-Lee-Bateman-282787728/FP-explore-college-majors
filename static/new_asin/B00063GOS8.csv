8037845,2,B00063GOS8,I'm hoping there is a much better dvd of Barry out there.  This was seems like it was almost like a rehearal show.  I was rather disappointed in this show.,1211068800,,155,4.133333333333334
8037846,4,B00063GOS8,"In my musical appreciation history, Barry White is the MAN. That being said, while this DVD lacks in overall polish and quality, it still provides an almost surreal snapshot in actually seeing Barry, Love Unlimted and the Orchestra do their thing. Until something better comes along, I'm sure, as low quality as it is, real BW fans will still find this a long-awaited thrill.",1161820800,2,375,4.875
8037847,1,B00063GOS8,This DVD soundwise is so bad. Nothing redeems it I'm afraid and the great Barry White deserves better. Surely if the great man was still alive he would not have let this drivel be released. Buy his cd's you will do much better.,1131580800,13,227,4.3023255813953485
8037848,1,B00063GOS8,"I am sure with today's new technology, this DVD should have been much better!  The video and sound is terrible!!  The legacy that Barry left,  this DVD does him no justice. This product shows that people would put out anything to make a few dollars. Save your money and enjoy his CD's.",1129852800,20,285,4.4423076923076925
