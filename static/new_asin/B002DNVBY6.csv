8365568,4,B002DNVBY6,"My students love these videos, and they learn more than they do with any other method of vocabulary instruction, but I was a little disappointed in this one because it uses the term ""pissed off"" in the very first video.

I am very impressed by this company.",1433116800,,445,4.6923076923076925
