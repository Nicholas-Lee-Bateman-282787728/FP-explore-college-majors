7937136,4,B00005B6LP,"Strong film with powerful message. Alcohol and Addiction groups thoroughly enjoy the film and it facilitates many discussion topics in alcohol and addiction groups, from addiction and addictive behavior to HIV/AIDS, and at risk groups for both.",1238371200,,244,5.621621621621622
7937137,5,B00005B6LP,"I caught Sweet Jane as a midnight movie, as I'm assuming is the norm.  This movie was haunting.  The high of love, the high of heroin, the low of death, and the low of addiction all play combatting roles in this movie.  If you're in for a tear-inducing depressing, but still wonderful film, watch Sweet Jane.",1024617600,5,308,4.464285714285714
7937138,5,B00005B6LP,"As some other reviewers, I was up late channel surfing when I came across something about a hooker being followed around by the kid from Dazed and Confused so naturally, I was intrigued.  This, as well as other great midnight movies that show on Showtime, Cinemax and sometimes HBO, are the reason I even turn on the tv (save for the Simpsons and Star Trek).  If you see one movie that isn't glorified by explosions and shiny things, DEFINITLY make it this one.  It's a bit odd, but if you can stomach the dark look on the underbelly of society, you'll find one of the best films you've ever seen.",1010448000,3,597,4.409090909090909
7937139,5,B00005B6LP,"I couldn't sleep tonight, so around 1:00 am i started flipping through some channels, and i see ""sweet jane"" on, it looked somewhat interesting...
I became so enthralled in it, i didn't get up to pee (which i had to do quite badly), and i told my aunt to shut up several times.
By far, the best movie i've seen in a long time (if not ever)
Needless to say, i rushed onto amazon.com to buy it so i can watch it again.",1009324800,2,416,4.024096385542169
7937140,5,B00005B6LP,"The opening sequence for this film was a real sitter downer, (if thats what you'd like to call it). It captivated me. The whole movie..captivated me. It is such an awesome love story, unlike any other I have ever seen.",1008979200,4,218,4.475
7937141,4,B00005B6LP,"This is a ""sleeper"" well worth watching!!! I was up very late one night and saw it on some cable premium channel. It stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a young teenager with full blown aids (due to reasons his step-father is responsible for).  He is a foster child that spends most of his time in and out of hospitals who refuses to take his medicine. He has seen what aids did to his deceased mother and his dead heroin junky brother. Jane is also an addict; who is well known at the local hospital for frequent overdoses; only this time, she is informed that she is hiv positive. she doesn't want to face the facts, and leaves the hospital on her own will; not knowing that he is watching her. it is a sad, but honest look at the way people and society deal with this dreaded disease and drug addiction. he follows her out of the hospital because he thinks ""she is an angel""... at first, she is appalled by his constant pursuit of him following her--but the two become in-seperable in the end. it is a twisted kind of love story; each try to help the other even though neither want to honestly comply. fate plays its hand in a wicked way; but the two find what they really want and deserve. don't miss out on this... its a real eye-opener.",986428800,6,1236,4.327586206896552
