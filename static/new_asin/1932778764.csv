203144,5,1932778764,"I have been reading the books written by Greg Laurie for the last year. I get the daily devotion from Harvest.org, he is so plain spoken I am so happy to have discovered such a man of God...Then I watched his video ""Lost Boy: the next chapter"" a few minutes ago. I would love to send a copy to my whole family to everyone at my church. God can restore and use anyone He creates no matter how broken.....none have to stay in sin....He will forgive us all...when we come to Him.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Boy-The-Next-Chapter/dp/1932778764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Boy: The Next Chapter</a>",1312588800,5,643,5.505050505050505
203145,5,1932778764,My husband and I ordered both The Lost Boy and The Lost Boy the next chapter. We love this documentary and have recommended it to all of are friends and family. Our kids (17&20yrs old)watched it with us and they too loved it.,1297296000,,225,4.255813953488372
203146,5,1932778764,"There are so many ""lost boys"" in this world that need to know that they are not alone and there is hope for them.  Pastor Greg, thank you for your ministry and for sharing your story.",1290124800,,183,4.083333333333333
203147,5,1932778764,"Lost Boy is compelling.... I cannot convey how inspired I have been as I searched my own life as a mother ... thinking of things I could have done and things I should not have done.  These words spoken in the film are still resonating in my mind and heart... The life you lived as a child has brought you to where you are now. It is time for me to let go of some resentments with my birthmother and with a friend who did me wrong.  I appreciate the film's truthfulness, directness, and transparency as it tells us what God wants from us.",1290124800,7,537,4.153846153846154
203148,5,1932778764,"This story has been a blessing to me and has offered much hope and direction for my prayers. It is so like the LORD to take a troubled life, turn it completely around, and use it to encourage people to stay in the battle against the enemy.",1289952000,4,239,4.1063829787234045
203149,5,1932778764,"Well done!  Amazing true life story of one of the most impacting evangelist of our time!  Greg Laurie charts his life through a heartbreaking childhood, troubled teen years and then straight into the light of God's path.  Now Pastor Greg is widely known as the world's most recognized Christian Evangelist!  His ministry grew out of the ""Jesus movement"" of the 70's.  He now pastors one of the largest mega churches in the US.  The tragic death of his son Christopher only served to fuel his passion for the lost....this man is the real deal.",1421193600,,542,4.712765957446808

203152,5,1932778764,"A very unique man that overcame a terrible childhood, a short-lived step dad's fantastic presence (until later in life when reunited),  blessed with a fantastic wife, Cathe Laurie, and his 2 sons, one of whom died 7/24/28 at age 33. Chris Laurie ran into a state  street cleaning truck (Laurie's son was speeding). Life: upside down and inside out...

This is Greg's story of overcoming and moving forward after yet another major tragedy hits. Not many would press on with such faith, love, patience, fortitude, kindness. The only thing I would LOVE to have heard more about is his still living other son, Chris' younger brother Jonathan Laurie.",1389398400,2,645,4.953703703703703
203153,5,1932778764,"I listen to pastor Greg on a regular basis. It was wonderful to know his story - where he came from, what he has been through, how he handled it, but more importantly WHO brought through it all.",1375660800,,194,4.131578947368421
203154,5,1932778764,"I have watched this documentary several times with different family members.  It still moves me to tears.  I moved to Riverside, CA, 9 months ago and have been attending Greg Laurie's church.  As far as I can tell, he is exactly what you see here!  This video goes further than his book with the unfortunate death of his son.  It will break your heart as he shares his pain and God's comfort.",1369612800,,392,4.388888888888889
203155,5,1932778764,"An awesome testimony of what Christ can do for us if we only accept HIM as our LORD.
Good purchase...",1356307200,,101,4.1
203156,5,1932778764,"This award winning documentary was brilliantly produced and directed. But more importantly, Greg's story is a true example of God's redeeming love, grace, healing and mercy. I worshiped at Greg's church years ago and have kept up with him over the years and marvel at the anointed power of his messages. When I heard this story for the first time I had no idea his life had been so difficult growing up. To see what the Lord did for this broken, lost little boy is a magnificent testimony to His colossal love for us. Greg has been tested on the anvil of adversity, and his story has profoundly affected my life and faith. As powerful as his ministry was before, it is even more so now. When I go through difficult times, sometimes his story comes to me and I say, ""There is hope indeed. God will get me through this.

This DVD is a powerful tool for evangelizing. Glory to God for His all consuming love that gives us such hope.",1351296000,2,929,4.401162790697675

He has a plan for every person on the face of the earth, as unique as each of us are.  Greg Laurie lived a life that could have turned out so differently.
