The diminutive comic uses a lot of physical humor and seems to dress up in drag in almost every movie. And why not, he makes a cute girl. In Bees In Paradise, when his wig is tugged on he exclaims, ""you made me loose my peek-a-boo curl!"" He does drag better than Robbin Williams or Dustin Hoffman, and funnier. Mister Cook Lady has him posing as a female cook to wheedle his way into a show. In Bees In Paradise, he land on a strange island inhabited solely be women as they kill off their husbands. Both films are very funny and hold up well today.",1306713600,,699,4.185185185185185
