8106583,5,B000E6G8JC,recommend this dvd to all Bishop Fulton Sheen admirers,1405036800,,54,5.111111111111111
8106584,5,B000E6G8JC,"In addition to his keen insights as both priest and scholar, the late Fulton Sheen was a precious and gentle soul who can - through these DVDs that have survived him - continue to leave you laughing at his jokes one minute and deeply moved by his life lessons and observations of our world and where it's headed the next. His sermons are as relevant today as when they first aired.",1397606400,,381,4.380281690140845
8106585,5,B000E6G8JC,"Instead of what is normally on TV.
I listen to the Bishop.
Keeps me grounded.
Timeless information for all ages.",1397174400,,112,4.65
8106586,5,B000E6G8JC,Bishop Sheen is great.  Whatever comes out of his mouth is either humorous with a message and always a  message worth hearing.  I'm so grateful for the videos that are affordably available....I wish there are more of these but I'm grateful for these.  He is a speaker for all the ages and I'm struck by the way his messages relate to life today as much as life back when he was on tv.,1393372800,,384,4.219178082191781
8106587,5,B000E6G8JC,Watched  him while growing up and his words still resonate today. It is one of my favorites to listen to.,1354492800,3,105,4.25

8106589,5,B000E6G8JC,"This DVD has perfect clarity.  They didn't colorize the 50's version, and its exactly how I remember it back then.  My kids ages 20 and 27 also enjoyed his Irish Wit.  Its great for the whole family.",1237593600,14,199,4.324324324324325
8106590,5,B000E6G8JC,"Unlike ""Sheen Gems"", this program was great! It had a lot more of Sheen and less of the unrelated poetry, scenic nonsense that the other sheen compilation (Sheen Gems) had.

Bishop Sheen really was a funny guy and his Irish humor is well captured in this DVD program.
Highly recommended.",1226275200,19,287,4.74
