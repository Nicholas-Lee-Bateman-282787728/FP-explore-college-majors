But to be honest, I can understand the importer not having the confidence to issue it in the region one formatt, because of the extra cost of the transfer, and the probable limited appeal. The title though, spells out the main theme; but regardless of whether the Cricketing inclusion puts US buyer's off or not, I have to imagine the same story, being set in America, with a small but close-knit community, bound together by their love of local competitive Baseball. But, my fascination with the first world war, in all it's wide and encompassing effect on the world, be it a huge city ,or small village, would far outweigh any such reservations.
At this miniature level, the gradual involvement by all males from age 18 to 40, that virtually all towns and villages in Britain made sacrifices for, can be seen today ,with their lists of brother's names, etched in stone for all time. Often whole families of males were decimated, in a epitaph to the effect, that engulfed the nation. The Cricket matches are a metaphor for the rivalry and determination that is felt by the young men , to win through regardless of the effort or cost. The real cost though, could never have been imagined or foreseen by anyone. The effects on this small farming community, was reflected throughout the whole country, with the loss of so much of it's labour force, that it badly affected the countries ability to feed itself. Beautifully filmed on location in the Dales of Yorkshire, the --you are there--ambience, is tangible. A short film, but good value in all qualities.  Recommended.
