I was very disappointed.",1512864000,,241,4.431818181818182
8072833,3,B000A2WDJ4,my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.,1364428800,,170,3.8857142857142857

8072835,3,B000A2WDJ4,"I'll give you a few quick lines on this movie.

A much-hyped sequel to the original Twins Effect (Also known as The Vampire Effect), this movie was a surprise to say the least. Rather than its sleek, stylish predecessor (chinese vampire kung fu? fantastic!), Twins Effect II is made in the style that a Fu Chow friend of mine says translates to ""Makes No Sense"". And I think that it meets that goal.

Now, whether or not that's a good thing is difficult to say. Were I from Hong Kong, I'm sure I would understand better. As it is, I see this movie as a satirical/surreal journey ""for the fun of it"". A sequel for sequel's sake - the actors are the same as in the original, the plot has no connection whatsoever. And that's disappointing. I really liked the original, as ""pop"" as it might have been, and I was really looking forward to seeing the next phase for the hip vampire kung fu comedy. This is along the lines of an even more self-aware Evil Dead III. With Jackie Chan. And pop stars.

An epic quest against an Evil Sorceress Queen in a matriarchal medieval kingdom. Will the twins and their male counterparts save the day and free the kingdom? Will they pair up and finally admit their love? Will they ever stop making movie trailers that begin with ""In a world...""

So, to reiterate, do not expect this to be a real movie. It's not. Some people might call it surrealist, but I don't think so. Surreal humor for me lands the joke a bit more, I don't think this hits it enough - but that may well be the point. You're not going to get anything out of it at all, except for some laughs along the way. Even then, perhaps you should go with a Stephen Chow flick instead.",1135209600,9,1674,4.321656050955414
