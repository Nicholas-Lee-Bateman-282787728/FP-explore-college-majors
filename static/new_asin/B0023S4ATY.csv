8350065,3,B0023S4ATY,"This is a Chicago independent at heart, containing five chapters of grit, loss and possible redemption. There is a mix of five directors, writers and cameramen all vying for a chance in having their individual improv skits meshing together into believable minimalism. Putting aside the bad sound, out of focus hand held cameras, and an unbelievable chain of events involving a missing child, there are some decent performances with a few harsh scenes.

The five chapters of the film all showcase different parts of the city during both day and night. Which makes this enjoyable for the fans in the Chicago art world, but outside of that the film presents nothing too attractive in being appealing to the outside world. The two lead characters are played by local actors, but their roles make for people you find hard to care about - including the guy who prostitutes himself out for pedophiles and paid self gratification. Our lead gal has internal conflicts about this missing child she thinks she knows something about, but self destructs each time she should have the common decency to help.

The picture quality is poor, the 2.0 sound horrible, no special features and a mixed bag of a production, all make for a lower rating, but in the eyes of some Chicago followers it might be a must see for the geography.",1247875200,,1314,4.8097345132743365
