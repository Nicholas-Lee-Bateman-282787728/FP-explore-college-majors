7385048,5,B014662I12,"Great series and so much action I cannot wait for collection 6
To have them both DVD & BLU-RAY is a must",1449187200,3,104,3.772727272727273
7385049,5,B014662I12,Fairy Tail is a fabulous series now just waiting for the next one.,1448236800,,66,4.153846153846154
7385050,5,B014662I12,"Funimation is on a role with releasing this Collections! I was surprised but pleased when this set was announced for release!

I am so happy to finally see Collection 5 and this arc dubbed. I love the cover as well. It has both Natsu and a memorable character who debuts briefly in the last collection, and officially in this set. (I won't spoil who it is for you guys.) Gajeel and Pantherlily are the characters on the front so Im guessing that by the time all the collections are out well have a chance to see at least the core Fairy Tail cast in the collections. I look forward to that! I wonder which members theyll choose next?!

~

This DVD set consists of episodes 97 - 120. Which was originally released as Fairy Tail Part 9 & 10 separately.

There are 8 discs included. Just so you know this is a DVD & Blu-ray combo pack meaning the Blu-ray is a copy of the DVD. So in reality it's 4 discs with four copies on Blu-ray. (I only add this because Ive received questions in the past about it)

The Blu-ray is breathtaking for the Fairy Tail series it just adds something that the DVDs don't have. The animation looks clearer and sharper. Not to mention the audio is better as well.

The collection dvd sets are worth having. They consist of twice the amount of episodes part volumes have. Yet they cost around the same price so they are well worth it. Sure they take longer to be released but its worth the wait for someone on a budget. Also I prefer these collections over parts because of the quantity as well. Thus far there will probably be at least 2 or 3 more collection sets consisting of Key of the Starry Sky & The Grand Magic Games Arcs. Before they release Fairy Tail 2014 as collections. (Fairy Tail 2014 may be animated slightly different but it follows the manga and continues where the original anime left off)

This is a fantastic collection of English dubbing! This has been worth the wait! Tenrou Island Arc is one of the positively best arcs Ive seen in Fairy Tail. It's worth watching again and again! The action, the plot, the suspense, the revelation, and some grimmer tones make it really enjoyable. Finally, we get to see the Fairy Tail guilds core members together competing in a full arc! After Edolas its a nice change of pace! Not to mention we meet some unexpected characters (weve only heard about since the first few seasons) in the flesh. A lot happens and it's an intense arc full many perils for the wizards. There is comedy, heart, suspense, painful moments, engaging battles and more. Its truly a great arc!

There is only one Story Arc in here:

Tenrou Island arc

Fairy Tail holds its annual S-Class Mage Promotion Trial, a trial that allows for one of eight selected candidates the opportunity to become the next S-Class Mage. But Carla has a vision of utter disaster for this year's trial, which is held at Fairy Tail's holy ground, Tenrou Island. The sudden appearance of a mysterious and deadly Mage who can kill without touching, and the arrival of members of the strongest Dark Guild, Grimoire Heart, quickly prove her right. Cana's past also comes into focus...

 If you're concerned about the price remember this is Amazon. Keep a look out because prices fluctuate back and forth a lot here. You just need to have patience.

It would have made more sense to end the collection on the episode where they return to Magnolia, rather than where they did.

Otherwise, as outstanding as always!",1473120000,,341,4.412698412698413

With the addition of the dark wizard Zereff, I'm speaking Greek to anyone who hadn't watched the series.  But from now on I'm buying the collections rather than the sets, as the collections are twice the episodes for the same amount.  Also you get to see the power of my favorite Loki, haha, shameful of me.",1464048000,2,456,4.404761904761905
