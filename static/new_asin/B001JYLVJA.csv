8314010,5,B001JYLVJA,"I bought this documentary to show to my freshman American government class when I had to go to a conference. It ended up being a really good choice. It discusses many current political issues such as, health care reform. It also shows how people from other countries view the United States and America, in general. Interestingly, many of the people interviewed do not view the U.S. in the best of light. Somewhat surprisingly my students were a bit hostile towards the documentary and didn't see how ""someone living in a hut could judge our life style"". However, I think it does an excellent job of showing the extent to which the U.S. culture/policies differ from European culture/policies. The author also does provide a good deal of statistical evidence to support her arguments. Overall, I thought the documentary was very eye opening.",1265328000,,839,4.957446808510638
