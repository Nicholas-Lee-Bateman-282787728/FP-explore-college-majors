1725873,4,B000068MAU,"The Warrior and the Sorceress managed to adapt the story from Korosawa's YOJIMBO to fair effect, giving this movie's plot far more originality and coherence than most of New Concorde's Sword and Sorcery efforts from the '80's.  The villains are more intelligent than most of their ilk, but it is the hero who proves to be the one-eyed man in the Kingdom of the Blind, as he proceeds to prod the badguys to self-destruction.  Of course we have the full run of scantily clad ladies cavorting about (this is to be expected), as well as the obligatory epic battle at the end (which is par for the course), but hey this is a B-Movie Sword & Sorcery epic, you need these things in it.
The special effects were kept to a minimum, almost to the point of non-existance, with most of the effort expended on sets and costumes for the lizardmen.  The props were (admittedly) rudimentary with only one or two outstanding examples of swords.
The acting was ... patchy, I believe is the best word.  It might be that under another director the actors would have delivered a more consistent performance.  The fight choreography and stunt work, well let's say you can tell they are trying not to hurt each other, but on the other hand Maria Socas was a definite pleasure to ogle, and her acting about on a par with her cohorts.
All in all, for what it was and what they had to work with, this is definitely a cut above the rest.
My final rating:  OK (Wow, OK, Eh, Sigh, Blech, Ach Ptooey).",1059955200,13,1471,4.470149253731344
1725874,1,B000068MAU,"I normally love all this 'Sword and Sorcery' stuff, but was sadly let down by this dire film - for starters where was the sorcery, or `The Mighty Wizardry' as the review on the back of the cover calls it??? Not one spell, incantation, curse, enchantment or lightning bolt in sight throughout the entire movie. All there is to mention is a sword that can chop through an anvil (the one and only time you see this done is when it's made towards the end of the film).
The storyline, dialogue, acting, fight choreography and the sets are all terrible filled with a cast of characters that are instantly forgettable - you kind of wish at the end of the film that a huge fireball would come and engulf them all. It would certainly add to the enjoyment.
All in all, at a short 81 minutes this film felt too long to endure it all the way through, so do yourself a favour and don't bother.",1038700800,5,880,4.307228915662651
1725875,1,B000068MAU,"This has to be one of the very, very worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to own, let alone watch. Granted, there are plenty of topless young ladies running around (and Ms. Socas is certainly bewitching enough as she romps around in the almost-altogether), but despite the allure of pointless nudity, what we have here is a no-holds barred gobblerfest.
While it is true that ""Fistfull of Dollars"" was a remake of the Kurosawa classic ""Yojimbo"", ""Dollars"" was a legitemate film in its own right. ""Warrior and the Sorceress"" is just a knockoff copy of both films, set for some reason on another planet.
David Carradine plays Kain, a ""dark warrior"" who is a stand-in for Clint Eastwood with a sword. The name Kain, of course, is the same name as perhaps Carradine's most famous character, from the classic ""Kung Fu"" television series. Obviously, the producers were trying to capitalize on Carradine's fame as much as possible, just as the producers of another copycat movie ""Double Double-Oh-Seven"" gave ""star"" Neil Connery (younger brother of the more famous actor), the character name of... Connery!
Other than being healthily in her prime (as you can tell when she's topless), Socas is forgettable. Carradine is obviously mugging his way through the horrible dialogue (probably hoping the movie would never be seen outside of its native Argentina).
Probably the only other somewhat recognizable actor is Anthony De Longis, who plays a Captain of the Guard. De Longis coreographed the fights in this and many other (more legit) films, and if you recognize the voice, you might just put it together with one of his best-known parts; the Kazon leader Cullah on ""Star Trek: Voyager"".
As for extras, there are some trailers for some other topless swordfight ""films"", like ""Barbarian Queen"" and ""Amazons"". No reason to buy this one unless you have some friends really good at MSTY-ing a bad movie... and I mean REALLY good at it!

1725890,3,B000068MAU,"First of all, I have never seen the film Yojimbo to which many other reviewers alude to as being the ""inspiration"" for the plot of The Warrior and the Sorceress, so I cannot comment if it is indeed a rip-off, though it probably is. I will say that as far as cheesy sword and sorcery films go, this one is pretty good. Mind you I'm comparing it to others of similar budget and ""quality"" such as Barbarian Queen or Ator the Fighting Eagle not to Conan the Barbarian or Beastmaster.
The main attraction here is the T & A content, of which there is plenty.(...) This is worth the price of the DVD alone. Also there is assorted nudity throughout the film in case one looses interest in the bare bones plot regarding a struggle over a water well by two evil warlords.
David Carradine plays Kaine or The Dark One, as he is called by almost everyone, who wanders into town and is entangled in the struggle for the water well. He switches sides often, depending on who pays the most gold and is as treacherous as he is cunning and greedy.
There are plenty of groan inducing moments, mainly one in which Carradinde fights a tentacled monster who is plainly all rubber and also a lizard creature who is little more than a sock puppet. In general The Warrior and the Sorceress delivers what it promises, a fun, light story with plenty of naked babes and sword fight scenes.",1114646400,7,1361,4.426294820717131
1725891,2,B000068MAU,"This movie is more boring than painful, but it is bad just the same. I bought it after reading the divergence of opinions here and found it to be mostly boring and mostly bad, with occasional points of light. Well, two points of light anyway. The first point of light: David Carradine plays a character named 'Kain', which is an obvious in-joke from his ""Kung Fu"" days when he played a character named 'Caine'. I don't know why this amused me so much, but I found that pretty funny for some reason. The second (and larger) point of light is Luke Askew as 'Zeg' in what is clearly the best performance in the movie. Askew is actually a very good actor, although he appeared in this and three other movies with David Carradine (including ""Kung Fu: The Legend Continues"") and even once on ""Knight Rider""! He is, of course, better known for his excellent characterizations in ""Cool Hand Luke"" and ""Easy Rider"". Here he is a beacon of light. His performance isn't one of the best in his career, but it certainly beats the other performances seen here.

Frankly, I am a fan of all genres of B-grade films, but the mystical films are not one of my favorite subsets of cheese. This one basically pits Kain, the 'Dark One', against everyone. He is a mercenary for hire to the highest bidder (although the trailer says it is the ultimate fight between good and evil): Carradine spends most of the film switching allegiances based on pecuniary considerations. It is tough to keep up with which side he's on at times, but in the end, inspired by the sorceress he sides with the peasant revolt and helps kill off the pig-faced slavers. Thematically, the film centers on the value of water as a natural resource and Kain's bank account. The movie has comically named characters like 'Bludge', 'Zeg', 'Burgo', 'Blather', 'Gabble' and 'Hubcap'. (I'm not sure about that last one; it is hard to understand some of the names.) Kain's power ultimately comes from the magic 'Sword of Ura' which the sorceress makes for him. It is so mighty it can cut through rocks! Zeg launches an all out war to get it, with the help of the fat guy and his talking pangolin (or is it a Komodo Dragon?) puppet (which speaks, though his lips don't move). Eventually Kane, sorry, I mean Kain takes on just about the whole planet and wins water for the oppressed masses.

This movie has both its share of good and bad. The swordplay is actually very good, particularly in the final scene. The big black clouds that herald Kain's entrance onto the battlefield and the incredibly stupid giant land squid (with teeth!) are leaders in the bad column. Also modestly in the bad column is leading lady Maria Socas (better known for her work in Argentinean cinema with such credits as ""Sobredosis"", ""El Color Escondido"", and the 2002 release ""Sin Intervalado"") who has serious hair issues (though to cut her some slack, this movie was made in 1984) and is really not a very good actress, and is frankly not quite attractive enough to walk around in her given costume (if you can call it that.) She isn't terrible, but mostly looks disinterested.

This movie isn't particularly good, but it isn't wretched either. It is too long, though, at 81 minutes. If it were an hour long it would be a much more entertaining production. Features of the DVD include trailers from this and many similar movies (actually the narration in the trailer made some sense of plot points which were confusing) as well as biographies/filmographies of the four central characters.

Two stars. It won't ruin your life or cause you to seek therapy, but there are many better (and many funnier) B movies out there.",1086825600,6,3640,4.665109034267913
1725892,2,B000068MAU,"First there was Yojimbo, then came Fistful of Dollars, and finally The Warrior and the Sorceress! The damsel in distress, the two warring factions in town, the old man befriending the hero, and the hero playing the two sides against each other for greedy profit; you know the story. However, W&S takes us much further...
There are the many unanswered questions teasing (or mocking!?!) the viewer within this classic retold:
1)who/what are those two hysterically laughing mutant dudes? Are they merely a whimsical afterthought to the plot to give the kids some cartoonish mayhem or a Fellini-esque effort to disorient the audience even further in this already baffling world? By the way, what happens to those guys? I think they just disappeared about halfway through the movie. But that's okay, they were really annoying.
2)Why is no one in the movie aware the Sorceress is NOT WEARING CLOTHES? These are some very loutish fellows, but there is an embarrasing lack of leering going on. It's like one of those dreams where you begin to realize something isn't quite right about being naked in public, except in this movie that point is never reached. I mean, by the end, she's even going into battle like that. I'm sure that put the fear into the other team.
3) What is that rat-like reptile? He ""speaks"" but no one seems concerned that his lips or whatever don't move! On the other hand, he doesn't look like he has much of a brainpan but he's giving advice to one of the head honchos. Maybe that's why they are in such a crappy situation. A failed life is really all about making bad decisions.
4)How does Luke Askew's cheiftan character ALWAYS have exact change? Every time David Carradine comes up with an off-the-wall amount for some lame favor, Askew has it ready in a bag right in front of him?! Now there, my fellow filmbuffs, is where my suspension of disbelief was yanked hard off its disbelief-place!
It was OBVIOUS Mr. Askew was reading ahead in the script and KNOWING  what sum Mr. Carradine would require. If only the Kung Fu master had improvised and ad-libbed something like, ""That'll cost you 400 takarats and 25 cents!"" Ahh, the look on Mr. Askew's face would have been worth the buck ninety-nine I got this tape for at the clearance rack. But I digress.
5)Finally, what the heck is it with the four-boobed lady? Obviously this special effect is where the budget went, because it was quite realistic. Disgusting, but realistic. This quadra-mammary dance sequence IS the most memorable scene. Strangely, it has never been included in those ubiquitous film montages they do at the Academy Awards. One wonders if she is one of a tribe, and if so, what do its men have four of?
In summary, one can't ignore the director's homage to Samurai films of old. The Warrior and the Princess is a worthy addition to the ""not very good sword and sorcery in the eighties"" movies and at a crisp 78 minutes, requires virtually no fast-forwarding.",1082678400,15,2946,4.742690058479532
1725893,2,B000068MAU,"You'd have to call this ""Yojimbo"" meets ""Kung Fu.""  Essentially a sword-and-sorcery remake of ""Yojimbo/A Fistfull of Dollars"" starring David Carradine, TWATS is remarkable faithful to its source material considering how many goofy in-jokes and hokey special effects it contains (the grizzled wandering swordsman played by Carradine is named Cain, for example).  You probably need to be drunk or (heaven forbid) high to fully appreciate this film; but it has its moments of goofy fun, and its a must for completests who need to have every remake of ""Yojimbo.""",1075593600,2,558,5.258426966292135
1725894,1,B000068MAU,"The sword and sorcery genre that emerged in the early 1980s produced some good movies and even more bad ones. ""Conan the Barbarian,"" Arnold Schwarzenegger's big break, serves as one of the better examples. In fact, his movie kicked off the Hollywood quest to run every successful new idea into the ground. And so they did, producing and distributing average fare like Albert Pyun's ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" and the atrocious ""The Warrior and the Sorceress."" Starring the inestimable David Carradine--still recovering from his stint on ""Kung Fu"" in the 1970s--""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" is schlock filmmaking at its cheesy worst. Carradine, whose weird public life is well documented, is one of those actors I have difficulty accepting fully. He does excellent work from time to time, but from the mid 1970s well into the 1980s (and perhaps, some would argue, into the present) he starred in loads of low budget films like Larry Cohen's ""Q,"" ""Deathsport,"" and ""Death Race 2000."" Undoubtedly, many of these films delight on some level yet they are hardly monuments to epic filmmaking. ""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" falls well below this category, a movie even fans of the sword and sorcery genre should forget.
""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" resembles Albert Pyun's ""Omega Doom,"" which in turn is a rip off of Akira Kurosawa's 1961 film ""Yojimbo."" It is amazing there are still filmmakers who will copy this film (Omega Doom was made in the late 1990s), but such is life. Why come up with a new idea when an old one will still draw in the dupes? I actually saw a few things to like in Pyun's effort. I saw little to enjoy in ""The Warrior and the Sorceress."" David Carradine plays Kain (!), a knight of sorts from some defunct society of guardians who now roams the blasted landscapes of a destroyed world. He stumbles into a little village--no more than two fortresses, actually--where two warlords battle it out for possession of a well. Each leader is more or less evenly matched in men and supplies, leading to a frustrating stalemate that wily tricks and epic plans of action rarely overcome for long. The only real losers in this battle are the hapless gaggle of townspeople who must beg and scrimp for a mouthful of the precious water. We don't really know what is going on at first, and frankly, we just as quickly realize we don't care to know. Yes, it is that bad, but don't worry your head about it. By the time this clunker grinds to a halt, you will be able to endure anything life may throw at you.
Kain adroitly plays both warlords off each other. He approaches the warlord Bal Caz, a fat, grinning fool who keeps a talking lizard creature near at hand (!) and offers his services for a sack of gold. At the first opportunity, Kain defects to the other warlord, Zeg the Tyrant, for a similar sack of gold. Kain flip-flops back and forth, stirring up loads of trouble amongst the two rivals paid for in the blood of their underlings. From time to time a mob of slavers turns up to wreak havoc on the village, another group the knight uses to shake things up. The film reaches a painful nadir when Kain battles a ""monster"" in a prison cell, a special effect that looks like it was made out of giant pipe cleaners. What's the purpose of this exercise? Perhaps Kain wishes to democratize the village by freeing the townspeople of these murderous thugs so the water will quench more thirsts. Maybe he wants to make a load of money. Since there is a sorceress involved--a woman named Naja who stumbles around in the buff all the time--who makes vague allusions to some magical sword every chance she gets, perhaps Kain is merely seeking a grand weapon. It's all so cheesily done, so gratingly banal, that I could care less about Kain's motives. Even a ""brutal"" drowning, an amusing strip scene, and the battle sequences at the conclusion can't make this turkey fly.
""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" fails on every level of moviemaking imaginable: the acting is laughable, the script should have been burned, the set pieces are a joke, and the pace absolutely drags. I think the movie only runs about eighty or so minutes but it felt like eons. Carradine looks embarrassed to be in this mess, and I cannot blame him when I think back to some of the humiliating scenes in the movie. Case in point: at the end of the film, a big battle rages over the water supply. The townspeople finally rise up to assert their rights and attack the soldiers standing guard over the well. Clearly visible are people falling down well after they were supposed to die. Ouch. It is this type of production values that elevate ""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" to the apex of mediocrity. Director John C. Broderick must have considered falling on his boom mike when he realized he crafted a disaster epic instead of an action film.
If you like a challenge, pick up the DVD version of the film. There isn't a lot in the way of extras, predictably, but there are a mess of sword and sorcery trailers for films like ""Barbarian Queen"" and several others. Many of these trailers point out a central fact concerning this particular film genre: sword and sorcery equals high cheese. If the makers of these films had aimed for camp, it might have been worth the effort. As it is, they now stand as monuments to inept filmmaking, and ""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" stands towards the top of the mountain in that regard.",1074729600,,5404,4.6419624217118995

The finished product might've been interesting if it wasn't for the fact that the movie is embarrassing, poorly made junk. David Carradine does a fine job as the guy with the big sword and there's some kitschy charm in the dirty set design and monsters, but this has been done infinitely better for the same or less money.

If you want to see a genuinely fun swords and sorcery epic, bit up ""Conan"" or go low brown and take in the ridiculously awesome ""Deathstalker"", which features monsters, magical sex changes and butt-loads of misogyny.

7964456,4,B000068MAU,"Representing the ""warrior"" of this movie title, the mysterious swordsman Kane (David Carradine; Kill Bill, Kung Fu: The Legend Continues) wanders into a small town, feels a bit parched, and frees the local well from hostile mercenary control, returning the water to the thirsty townsfolk.  Naturally, they're so happy that they celebrate with nude well-top pole-dancing.  Yeah, it's gonna' be that kind of Sword and Sorcery flick.

The town is run by two criminal rulers: Zeg the Tyrant (Luke Askew; Frailty), the more calculating politico, and Bal Caz, an obese fool who accepts counsel from his monstrous pet lizard--reminding me of Jabba the Hut and Salacious Crumb.  Kane behaves more as a manipulative rogue than a warrior, pitting Zeg and Bal Caz against one another for his own personal gain.

Setting the Sword & Sorcery mood, this world has two suns and scarce water (much like Dungeons & Dragons Dark Sun campaign setting), there is some mythically sharp magical Sword of Ura (Dungeons & Dragons' Sword of Sharpness), and topless mystics and servants abound.  The ""sorceress"" Naja (Maria Socas; Deathstalker II: Duel of the Titans, Wizards of the Lost Kingdom) is kept as Zeg's slave and her only magical qualities are revealed by her wardrobe, or lack thereof.  She pretty much just walks around topless all the time.  I don't think we ever don't see her topless unless she's altogether off-screen.  Not only is she perpetually topless, but for some reason no one ever seems to noticeyou knowbecause that's totally normal.  This would have been more appropriately titled The Warrior and the Topless Sorceress.

Carradine was 48 when this was released, but boy did he look worse for wear.  He could have passed for his mid-50s easily.  How about the muscled version of Carradine on the movie poster?  Reminds me of the muscled Clark Griswold from the National Lampoon's Vacation (1983).  It turns out that as our hero, Carradine is about the least-muscled person in this whole movie, and I'm including the topless sorceress.  Do some push-ups or something, man!  Despite the skills we know Carradine possesses, the fights in this movie are laughably bad.

The acting is pretty lame across the board, but the best performance was given by Bal Caz' bipedal well-dressed pet lizard thing, which also served as the most interesting character in the movie.  Was this reptile pulling the strings the whole time?  Were Bal Caz and the lizard romantically involved?  There was so much to explore there.  At only 81 minutes, they certainly had room to expand on this little sideplot.

What separates this movie from Deathstalker (1983) and the like is that the humble budget included a tentacle monster (much like a Roper or Otyugh from Dungeons & Dragons) to contribute to the fantasy element.  That, and of course a four-breasted exotic dancer.  Yes.  FOUR!  Total Recall (1990, 2012) had a three-breasted prostitute, Necropolis (1987) had a six-breasted necromancer, but before any of that we had a four-breasted exotic dancer paving the way for the polymastia-gifted ancillary female characters film!  God bless this movie!

As far as overall content and quality goes, this is a pretty good ""bad"" Sword and Sorcery movie.  It has all of the nudity of the shameless contributions to the genre, yet it makes the effort to deliver more story (however poorly written) and fantasy elements as well.",1395532800,,3398,5.037634408602151
7964457,3,B000068MAU,"Argentinian actress Maria Socas carries this film.  We've seen the storyline before in ""Yojimbo"" and ""A Fistful of Dollars"" but now with a sword-and-sandal Fantasy twist where a sorceress is held as a hostage instead of a main characters' wife.  And oh what a hostage she makes!  Maria Socas is a beautiful woman and her beauty is on full display in this film.  Her costuming is straight out of a Frazetta painting, with all the powerful eroticism retained.  The supporting characters are so-so but the actors are obviously doing what they can with them.  Carradine seems almost bored (or stoned) and the fight scenes are generally weak.  Still, we have Maria Socas unashamed of her feminimity, and that counts for a lot in this genre.  This film could have been so much more had there been greater peril to the damsel; such as a torture scene or two where Carradine has to come to her rescue.  As it is, even the ""horror"" of a girl drowning for the evil king's entertainment is only done so-so, and Carradine doesn't lift a finger to save her, or really seem to care one way or another.  Not exactly hero material, but then he's supposed to be the self-centered type out for his own riches and not a true do-gooder... until he finds the Sorceress in her jail cell.  Alone.  Helpless.  Looking for her hero.  That's when the tide turns.

It ended there, for those who have watched this movie.  You watch this movie because Maria Socas shows her upper self as the captive sorceress, because Cecilia Narova has two pair, and because Liliana Cameroni skinny dips.  Eva Adanaylo shares a little too, and that's as good as this movie is going to get.  David Carradine sword fights and generally elbows his way through 3 different armies single-handedly killing a hundred trained warrior swordsmen or so.  Luke Askew does a fair job of portraying an idiot tyrant Zeg, and Guillermo Marin is a perfect slob of a weenie tyrant Bal Caz who should have had Jim Henson help him with his lizard pet/familiar.  Anthony De Longis is the previously most feared (before David Carradine) swordsman captain of the guard, and the only part of this film women will enjoy.  The acting is worse than B-movie here, the special effects barely exist, and the fighting is as believable as when somebody says they owe you a favor, or they'll meet you halfway.  The film was made in Argentina and A.K.A. ""Kain del planeta oscura.""  I'm not necessarily looking for a documentary on owls, but this film needed more hooters.  Definitely not a family film, and probably isn't going to work well as a ""date"" film.  Surely David Carradine regrets being in this film.  Having said that, I'm going to watch it again; not for the action, but because of the scenery.",1332547200,2,1556,4.757462686567164
7964459,1,B000068MAU,"This film is not rated, and if given the task to do so, I would rate it STUPID!  The plot is non-existent.  The dialog is STUPID!  The action is STUPID!  The entire scene of the drowning nude with the pubic beard is entirely irrelevant.  It is degrading to Mr. Carradine's acting abilities to have played the lead in such a piece of trash.  He was probably hired because his name/fame would draw attention to the film.  If you are looking for something equal to Kung Fu, this is NOT it.  Save your money.  Breasts and pubic hair do NOT constitute a movie!  I had the dvd less than two hours and have already dropped it at a thrift shop.  This film is a piece of worthless junk.",1292889600,,677,4.251968503937008
7964460,5,B000068MAU,"I got this one on VHS because I'm not shelling out the sixty plus bucks for this on DVD. But having never seen this movie until now, I must say I really liked it. I don't know how this movie slipped past my radar,but it is low budget sword and Fantasy fun! Carradine does an acceptable job as the underdog hero. The villains over act dripping with scene stealing ferver,and the Scorceress was nearly naked the whole time, ...funny I don't even recall what her face looked like! This is exactly what you would expect from that time period. Good cheap entertainment. Every body keeps making fun of the lizard puppet guy, but I thought it was pretty cool. (much better than the cave puppet from Deathstalker!) Anyhow one thing you should watch for, is a scene at the end of the movie when carradine is making his grand loner exit from the village. One of the peasant guys stands up in front of the camera, someone starts to clearly tug on his costume to get him to move out of the shot. I rewound this and watched it three times. It was pretty funny. I do wish the price of this would drop on DVD, because it is worth owning.",1260835200,,1122,4.322274881516588
