5373526,5,B009Z59782,"I received an Amazon Gift card as a birthday gift and purchased this collection of musicals. I love it !! So worth it. Great value, great quality. Thank you Amazon for never disappointing me.",1390867200,4,191,4.647058823529412
5373527,4,B009Z59782,I bought this for my grandchildren because they had watched some of the old tapes I had.  They were delighted to see some familiar ones and many new ones.  They are enjoying them and sing along with many of the songs.  It is wonderful to see them enjoying the movies I love.  It has a good variety of movies.,1390608000,14,308,4.169491525423729
5373528,5,B009Z59782,Loved having all these in one collection.  I teach orchestra and love being able to use clips of musicals to help students learn about how music is used.  Especially Singing In The Rain where they see the change from silent movies to talkies.  Will use clips from most of these as they years go by.  (I also love musicals and big dance number. :) ),1389916800,2,348,4.3076923076923075
5373529,5,B009Z59782,"Excellent selection of movies- movies by Warner Bros. AND MGM!!! We were worried that the viewing quality might be poor given the price per disk (we've had that with some discount collections from other brands) but so far we've watched The Wizard of Oz and Willy Wonka and the viewing quality has been great! Some great family viewing, and some disks (ex Cabaret) for grown-ups.",1389744000,,378,4.8307692307692305

5373531,4,B009Z59782,"In celebration of its Anniversary, Warner Bros. is releasing its (and MGM'S) vast film library in genre specific Box Set Collections. The ""20 Musicals Collection"" is, for the most part, cause for grand celebration. The 20 films collected here are a good to great historical representation of the genre.  Most of the films included here have deservedly made several ""Best Of"" or ""Top Ten"" film lists.  The DVDS are housed in sturdy, attractive purple cases; neatly divided into three separate sections: 1927-1951, 1951-1964, and 1967-1988.
  1927-1951: ""The Jazz Singer"" was obviously included for its historical importance; as the film that revolutionized the motion picture industry. It's only ""part talkie"", and half silent. It's hard to believe that ""Broadway Melody"" won Best Picture of 1928-1929. When this ""Melody"" isn't stilted, it is melodramatic. The entertainment finally kicks into high gear with the sassy and snappy backstage tale "" of 42nd Street"". ""The Great Ziegfeld"" is an epic, all-star  biopic; the forerunner  of those epic, road-show musical releases that came into (and quickly out of) fashion in the 1950's-1960's. The best musical of the 1930's is,  definitely, ""The Wizard Of Oz"", the beloved classic starring Judy Garland that remains in a special class by itself. James Cagney won an Academy Award for his role in the patriotic ""Yankee Doodle Dandy."" Eyebrows were raised, no doubt, when ""An American In Paris"" won the Best Picture Academy Award against ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" in 1951. Still, there is no denying the overall excellence of the production, especially  the magnificent ""American In Paris"" ballet.
  1951-1964: This section  starts out grand enough; with ""Show Boat"" and ""Singin' In The Rain."" No arguments from me on these two choices. But  now  my problems begin. I can't stand ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"", and the alleged ""small town, marching down Main Street, U.S.A"" charms of ""The Music Man"" bore me to death-- well, at least, to sleep. The best musical in this section is 1954's ""A Star Is Born""; representing a brilliant dramatic and musical tour-de-force and artistic apex for director George Cukor and monumentally talented star Judy Garland. In his own way, Elvis Presley is just as magnetic and talented as Judy Garland. (Sadly, both Elvis and Judy gave their all to show-biz and worked themselves, literally, to death). Elvis really sizzles opposite the equally hot Ann Margaret in the fun ""Viva, Los Vegas."" Still, I'm perplexed: Why are ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"" and ""The Music Man"" included here instead of ""Gypsy"" and ""My Fair Lady""? ""My Fair Lady"" seems a particularly odd omission; especially since it won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture"", for Warner Bros. in 1964. Maybe the rights are now owned by Paramount, the ""home studio"" of divine ""Fair Lady"" Audrey Hepburn. and Warner Bros, can't get them back? Your guess is as good as mine.
  1967-1988: Ever wonder how the musical film died? Watch the opulent, costly and crumbling ""Camelot"", where Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave mumble their way through Lerner and Loewe's melodious and lovely score. The genre was moribund, and thank God Bob Fosse, Liza Minnelli, and Joel Grey brought it back to adult life with ""Cabaret."" Actually, after ""Camelot"", all the films in this section shine and entertain in diverse ways. Robert Preston, better than in ""The Music Man"", steals the show as Toddy, the cabaret artist who helps Julie Andrews become the toast of Gay Paree in the warm, witty and wise gender-bender gem ""Victor/Victoria."" Oddball, endearing charm is also on display in ""Willy Wonka And ""The Chocolate Factory"", ""Little Shop Of Horrors"" and ""Hairspray."" Fittingly, the Musical genre is celebrated once again in the original ""That's Entertainment!"", a glorious clip-fest where, among MGM'S countless stars, Judy Garland deservedly and easily steals the show once again.
 Most of the DVDS (but not all) include audio commentary or some Special Features.  In addition, the Box Set includes a colorful booklet, with information and photos from every film included. So, get ready for a fun Musical Film Festival. Pass the Popcorn: This is REAL entertainment!",1362268800,70,4203,5.193786982248521
