3771206,5,B001QW3SO6,"Peers teaching peers out of their open and honest experiences lends a voice of wisdom and insight.
Refreshing, honest and open dialouge.
This is a highly valuable resource for parents, schools and church communities.

3771207,5,B001QW3SO6,"The real teenage girls in this video talk about sex, choices, teen boys, and consequences in some predictable ways and in many more that I would never have anticipated hearing.  It was an education for me as an experienced woman over 50 -- my friends and I never really discussed these things in adolescence or young adulthood!  So it was helpful to hear what these girls had to say as I continue to visualize age-appropriate discussions with my young daughter.  Some of the girls are shown speaking individually with the offscreen interviewer, and some parts of the video show girls in group discussion.  The video is tasteful, authentic, and sometimes heartbreaking.  I can still see the face of the young mother who, for me, stole the show.",1234396800,,743,4.818897637795276
3771208,5,B001QW3SO6,"This video is a necessary tool for every parent/teacher/counselor working with middle and high school kids in today's world.  It is candid, current, and poignant. The content speaks to the audience in a way that they cannot help listening and learning.  Many of those sticky topics are handled with grace, but also with frankness that many high school kids crave.",1234396800,,363,5.033333333333333
3771209,5,B001QW3SO6,"We used this DVD to talk to high school girls about sex in our high school program. The girls loved the fact that the DVD included the interviews of the gilrs who were their age. It definitely took the edge off the subject. The discussion that followed each chapter was easy flowing.
The DVD does a great job of walking you through the whole conversation in a logical step by step way. Some of the topics discussed were teen pregnancy, birth control, teen pressure related to sex and others.
I highly recommend it to parents who are looking for ways to start sex conversation with their daughter.",1234396800,,596,4.579439252336448
3771210,5,B001QW3SO6,"This is a powerful video showing teenage girls from different races and walks of life discussing the emotional implications of sex.  While most educational videos provide lectures by adults, this video shows girls, in their own words, sharing their experiences and giving advice to other girls.  I highly recommend this video to all parents and boys and girls middle school and up.",1234396800,,381,5.129032258064516
3771211,5,B001QW3SO6,"This DVD is so timely, ""real"", and important.  As a parent, I don't want to find myself wishing I had talked openly with my kids about sex when it's too late.  The DVD is so different than what I remember seeing in school - it has girls talking about their values and what really happens, unscripted and honest.

The guide that comes with this DVD is extremely helpful to navigate the discussions that are prompted by questions at the end of each section.  I know from my work with teens in schools that club sponsors appreciate all the help they can get in leading discussions, particularly those that deal with sensitive and potentially awkward subjects as sex and sexual health.

I recommend gathering a group of teens you know and having a great discussion around this video - you will be leading a discussion that will make a huge impact on them and their future.",1233532800,,868,4.574193548387097
3771212,5,B001QW3SO6,"Every parent and teen should see this DVD!  As a parent, sex can be such a difficult subject to broach.  Yet this DVD makes it easy by relying on real girls who could be your daughter's friends.  It doesn't make your eyes glaze over with statistics and clinical terms, but relies on what girls and boys spend a lot of time thinking and talking about - relationships, and the impact of these choices on their sexual health.  In between stories, you can pause the tape and talk about specific questions, so kids can really contextualize the information for their own life.  Make sure your teen watches this video, and ask your school to buy one too!",1233532800,,647,4.543103448275862
8336614,5,B001QW3SO6,"The 7th grader from The Wisdom of Girls: Teens, Sex & Truth who made a conscious decision to disallow the influence of her peers made an impact on me. She realized she didn't want her friends, who will probably not be long-term, to influence such a big decision in her life. My daughter will be in 7th grade next year. Thank you for the ""seed-planting"" idea! And thank you Barb for the beautifully done video.",1369008000,,409,4.466666666666667
8336615,5,B001QW3SO6,"This DVD unequivocally lets the EXPERTS do the talking. Who better to discuss the pressures of early sexual activity than the girls themselves? The fact that these girls speak so candidly is what makes for such strong audience impact. Not just for girls..... parents, teenage boys, school counselors, and teachers will benefit from the viewing of this DVD. Thought provoking question sessions within the body of the video allow for instant analysis by the viewer. No other pamphlets, lists of statistics, books or discussions will convey the depth of the WHY behind teenage intercourse; kudos to the producer for her very complete product!",1308441600,,639,5.213592233009709
8336616,5,B001QW3SO6,"The Wisdom of Girls delivers EXACTLY what the title says it does! Under the intelligent guidance of teen expert and creator Barb Steinberg, teen girls speak candidly and share the wisdom of their own experiences, struggles and hopes. Powerful questions are posed after each section so the DVD becomes both interactive and practically applicable for its viewers. After having personally worked with over 10,000 teen girls, I can wholeheartedly endorse both the valididy and raw honesty with which The Wisdom of Girls is delivered. At a time when teen girls are more at risk for STD's and sexual objectification, The Wisdom of Girls: Teens, Sex and Truth is a must for all life skills programs, therapists and teen group leaders, and of course parenta raising teen girls today!

8336617,5,B001QW3SO6,"This is a candid video by girls, about girls and for girls, centering around the ""touchy"" subject of sex.  Teenage girls and young women who have either had sex or have conscientiously decided to wait to have sex are filmed in a roundtable format discussing their experiences around the topic.  There are also one-on-one interview-style discussions with the moderator edited so that the girl/young woman is talking directly to the audience.  Statistics and talking points are cleverly placed between each vignet so that the video can be paused for discussion.  You can tell that this video was clearly created by someone very much in-touch with the teen psyche because it never seems boring, uncomfortable or dogmatic (as I remember sex education videos being when I was a teen!).  This video would be ideal not just for educators but also for parents and/or teens to watch together.  I highly recommend it!",1241049600,,907,5.013333333333334
8336618,5,B001QW3SO6,"As an Educational Psychologist, I have had the opportunity to be a part of many workshops with middle school and high school girls while they watched this film. I was initially shocked by how little the girls initially knew about themselves and their own power when it comes to their bodies and sex. After the workshop it was amazing to watch how the girls' positive opinions of themselves and knowledge about sex increased after participating in the workshop. The girls were no longer afraid to ask questions about sex and their bodies...it was very evident that they needed this workshop. If you have a daughter in middle/high school or know someone who does, this film is vital to their positive psychological development - especially in school districts where comprehensive sex education is not available.",1239148800,,809,5.044776119402985
8336619,5,B001QW3SO6,"As a clinical social worker, mother of two and former teen, I believe this video is an excellent tool for creating discussion opportunities around sex for young girls (and boys!), parents, therapists and educators.  The DVD opens the door for communication by asking the difficult questions that are in everyone's mind but that are often too hard or embarrassing to ask.  The video calls for multiple breaks where questions are posed for discussion and/or writing.  The girls in the video are so honest and real and are amazingly open at sharing their personal experiences around sex, love, friendship, birth control, teen-parenting, peer pressure and more.  The video definitely advocates for making conscious choices and highlights both the emotional and physical consequences of having sex, but it also includes discussion around both sides of the decision to have sex or wait.  A distinct section is included on knowing when it IS the right time to have sex.  In summary, a one-of-a-kind presentation that will absolutely enhance any discussion involving a teenager around the many issues involved in deciding whether or not to have sex.",1238112000,,1141,5.2076502732240435
8336620,5,B001QW3SO6,"Discussing boys, dating, sex, birth control, etc. is not easy for most parents. And most teenagers don't want to discuss these things with their parents. As a father with a daughter, I found this DVD and guide to be just what we needed. The guide that comes with the DVD was invaluable. It really helped my wife and I understand what might be going on in our daughter's mind, how to ask questions to help her to open up and what questions to ask. The guide walked us through how to prepare our daughter on what she can say or do when she finds herself in a sexual situation - how to speak her mind and feel empowered to say what she wants and doesn't want. I can't recommend this product enough if you are a parent. This should be in all of the schools as well.",1236556800,,761,4.183673469387755
8336621,5,B001QW3SO6,"As someone who volunteers with teen girls, this DVD & guide is now a ""go-to"" for me when we have discussions about sexuality. I love that these are REAL GIRLS! These aren't actresses, and that makes all the difference for me. The facilitator's guide made it easy for me to lead the discussion and offered thought-provoking questions for the girls. I highly recommend this DVD & Guide for anyone who cares about teens and their sexual health. Great product!",1235865600,,456,4.784810126582278
8336622,5,B001QW3SO6,"This DVD offered a unique and important opportunity for our parents group to discuss what is an often uncomfortable topic. It provided an excellent catalyst for a frank and in-depth discussion among a group of dedicated and concerned parents who were eager to understand the issues facing or to be faced by our children. Hearing from young women who have been there about some of the issues my daughters will face as they grow up had a powerful impact on me and my husband. Viewers will hear from teenage mothers as well as from teens who have chosen abstinence. It is a powerful video, whether just to open your eyes to the issues facing teens today or to help parents begin an important dialogue with their children. Some of the revelations of the young women are shocking. Some will break your heart. All will have an impact.",1234828800,,828,4.639455782312925
8336623,5,B001QW3SO6,"Wisdom of Girls is a great parenting tool as well as an educational tool.
Moms and Dads may want to consider sharing and watching this video with their teens, both boys and girls to talk about teenage sexual relationships, in a healthy, supportive way!",1234656000,,252,4.75
