8227657,1,B000F8OIYG,"Porque la bachata y el merengue no sale con un DVD de calidad.

Porfavor Cervesa Presidente metan mano y hagan una production de nuestra musica dominicana como lo saben hacer.",1161734400,,175,4.833333333333333
8227658,3,B000F8OIYG,"This is a low budget DVD production featuring some videos and some live performances. Half of the songs are from Reyes' last CD, the others are some of his greatest hits. I believe the index on the box is not correct and that the DVD has one more song. Unfortunately you can only watch the songs one by one, it is not possible to play them in succesion. No bonus features added. If you are in to bachata, this is still a good buy.",1154044800,,430,4.130952380952381
