8390107,5,B0036MQO5Y,"My five year old grandson loves this series of cartoons. I love them too, because they teach values that I teach. They teach friendship, honesty, loyalty, community ethics, dependability, etc. I think these are very important concepts that need to be practiced by one and all. These cartoons reinforce these concepts and support my teaching. I very highly recommend these cartoons.",1271808000,,381,5.262295081967213
