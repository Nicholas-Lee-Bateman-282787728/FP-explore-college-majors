3943739,5,B002KPINY8,"Stargate 15th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray] After playing about a 150 BR's this is the first one that does not play but the previews.. It won't let me enter in Theatrical Version,Extented or even Scene Selection...

  AFTER THE FIRMWARE UPDATE THE THE BLU WORKS AND THE PICTURE IS STUNNING...",1259107200,4,292,5.041666666666667
3943740,5,B002KPINY8,"This 15th Anniversary edition is no gimmick, is has wonderful picture quality and really great sound. For a movie that was so great and spawned a few TV spin offs Stargate the movie really needed and deserved this, especially after the lack luster first release on Blu ray.

So for those owning the first release on bluray and wondering if this is worth the upgrade is most certainly is in every way picture-sound-bonus material, and I havn't even started watching the all new special features which by the way seem like their going to be very cool and I'm usually not even into special feature or bonus material.",1257897600,10,613,4.675925925925926
3943741,5,B002KPINY8,"After all the poor releases of this film, Lionsgate has finally stepped up and given the fans the REAL Ultimate Edition.  This is a new 1080p VC-1 film-to-disc transfer (~25 Mbps peak), with an all-new 7.1 DTS-HD MA audio track (7 Mbps peak) which literally shakes the floor and sounds more alive and active than I've ever heard.  I can't compare this to the 2006 blu-ray since I never purchased it (after reading that it too was subpar), but it's a massive upgrade from my 2003 Artisan disc.  Rounding out this release is 4+ hours of bonus content, none of which is contained on the previous blu-ray.  The best part of the deal was the fact that I was able to purchase this for $9.99 from a local big box retailer due to some confusion over which version was on sale.  If you haven't purchased the 2006 blu-ray (and even if you have!) this is a must-own for fans.",1257033600,192,864,4.408805031446541
3943742,3,B002KPINY8,"This is an interesting approach, a review from someone who has seen the disc itself, unlike the first four reviews.  Although I do agree that MGM could have built a new studio from the income from the multiple releases of this title.  The first two were sub-par quality releases that were not anamorphic.  The third release included the both versions and were animorphic.  They were a big step up but clearly atleast the second release was strictly for the money.  The final DVD release prior to this one, did not include the Theatrical version.  Stargate was one of the first film on Blu-Ray as it first appeared in 2006.  It contains no extra features and has only a DTS soundtrack, which is actually quite good.  How does the new release compare to the first BR?  Unfortunately, the image quality is UNCHANGED.  It appears to be the identical transfer as the 2006 version.  The new release does include the theatrical version, which in my opinion, is superior.  The Extended Version gives away the plot to early and repeats a screne or two.  I also like that in the theatrical release, when the general must decide whether to include Dr. Jackson on the mission, Kurt Russell with his back to the camera says ""It's Your Call"", instead of ""He's full of S...."" which he says in the extended version.  The sound is slightly improved on the anniversary edition and it does include about 2 hours of bonus stuff.  If you simply like the film and are not interested in the bonus features and the Extended version is the one you like, there is not image quality improvement so I would say, do not waste your money.  Since I like the Theatrical version, I invested in the new one.",1256688000,13,1673,4.601351351351352
3943743,5,B002KPINY8,"This Blu-ray will be a 50 gig disc opposed to the first one which was only 25 gig.  Just like early DVDs were pretty much just a low quality copy of the movie with no extras the same thing happened with early blu-ray. They lacked a lot of features and only used 25 gig discs.

I will be purchasing this blu-ray as this is such a visually stunning movie worth the purchase.  Not all movies are needed on blu-ray but this is one that is a must buy.

When looking to buy new blu-rays check the package to make sure that they are at least 50 gig discs.",1255046400,35,548,4.046296296296297
3943744,5,B002KPINY8,"No one can really review this product because it isn't out yet, but to answer (and counter) the above poster, there are several reasons to buy this release even if you bought the first Blu-ray release. I knew better; Stargate had at least 3 DVD releases (the first two were subpar), so why wouldn't Blu-ray be the same? I held off on the barebones Blu-ray (one of the first films to the format), even though it could be had uber-cheap.

The intitial Blu-ray only had the director's cut, which I find inferior to the theatrical cut (gives away too much at the beginning for one thing), so I never bothered to buy it. The new release will have both cuts of the film, plus lossless audio instead of just DTS-HD High Resolution (which is still very good). I would expect an improvement in video quality as well. I believe the first release was a 25GB Blu-ray with MPEG-2 compression.

Plus, this disc should have a slew of extra features, including but not limited to those contained on the Ultimate Edition DVD.  From thedigitalbits:

""You'll get both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film via seamless branching, along with audio commentary by director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin, The Making of Stargate documentary and the Is There a Stargate? featurette. You'll also get a 3 all-new featurettes (Deciphering the Gate: Concepts and Casting, Opening the Gate: The Making of the Movie and Passing Through the Gate: The Legacy), a gag reel, the BD-Java Master of the Stargate interactive trivia game and the Stargate Ultimate Knowledge PiP viewing mode.""

I am very excited that Stargate is finally getting the Blu-ray treatment it deserves.",1250467200,89,1658,4.84452296819788

3943747,5,B002KPINY8,"Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader of ""Wolf"" 1994 popularity) does the unthinkable by even suggesting that The Ancient Egyptian Civilization may have been influenced by outside influences, very outside influences. This runs off all inquiries to his theories.

But wait it looks like some one is interested in his cryptology abilities. Catherine Langford (Viveca Lindfors) had a secret that her daddy found years ago. Her secret will change the life of Daniel and Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell). Turns out that they will have a mission that will take them on a sojourn to the other end of the known universe. We go with them. What will we find and will we be able to bet back?

CON: You have to sit through at least 15 minutes of ads for ""upcoming"" movies and TV shows before it even gets to the menu.  And you can't skip past it...you're just stuck with it.  So pop in the DVD and then go pop some popcorn, use the rest room, maybe even eat dinner.

3943765,3,B002KPINY8,"I've always liked this movie though I haven't seen it in quite some time prior to purchasing this 15th Anniversary Edition on Blu-ray. There are ample reviews on the film itself out there, so I won't comment on the movie (the story, I mean).

I decided to give 3 stars for this Blu-ray edition because the picture quality is extremely grainy and, quite frankly, terrible. I noticed many of the ""most helpful"" reviews that pop up toward the top say that the original Blu-ray release was that way, but that it was fixed with this version. If that's the case, I'd hate to see what the original Blu-ray edition was like. Searching the reviews here with the keyword ""grainy"" shows that there are many other people who also found this edition to be pretty poor quality. Someone described it as being like watching on an old-school CRT television over the air with a pair of rabbit ears that's picking up a weak signal, and I think that's an apt way to put it. Maybe the 20th Anniversary Edition is better? I'm just glad I picked it up dirt cheap in the secondary market.",1485475200,,1064,4.512953367875648
