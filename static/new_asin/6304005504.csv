772584,3,6304005504,I love these two together in a comedy.  The up and down relationship is very intertaining.  I hadn't seen this one for over 30 years and it wasn't quite as funny as what I had remembered as a teen.  I still definitely liked it and would recomend it to others.,1178928000,,259,4.14
772585,3,6304005504,"Matters of sexuality apart, Rock Hudson and Gina Lollobrigida would make highly desirable bedfellows, beautiful as they were in the mid 1960's.  Melvin Frank's comedy is only average, but it has some very funny moments.  Gig Young and Terry-Thomas provide good support.  Lollo, dressed by Jean Louis, is a sight to behold; not to mention that her gift for comedy manages to surface here and there.",1168905600,3,397,4.984848484848484
772586,4,6304005504,"This couple, Rock Hudson and Gina Lolibridgita is always fighting because she's different from him and has her own idea and stands for women's rights and then before you know they are made for each other but she also is  involved with another man with hilarious results so be prepared to laugh.  Find out who gets the girl by watching the movie.",956707200,23,345,4.548387096774194

772782,5,6304005504,Rock Hudson did a number of these romance comedies. Most of them are great. This is definitely one of the good ones. Gina Lollobrigida held her own. Delightful. Recommended.,1402444800,,173,5.0

772915,5,6304005504,Enjoyed this comedy film  very much when I was lucky enough to see it in a theatre. Rock Hudson is always superb and Gina Lollobrigida provides wonderful support.,1362268800,,162,4.785714285714286

772918,4,6304005504,"So funny after all these years.  Rock Hudson and Gina Lollobrigida were as much a comedy team as Rock and Doris Day.  Having lived in Italy for five years it was hilarious when the two were fighting and Rock Hudson says, 'You never make any sense!'  She replied, 'I don't have to make sense, I'm Italian!'  If you like old comedies I would recommend this.",1330905600,,355,4.415384615384616
772919,2,6304005504,"I love Rock Hudson movies so I took a chance and ordered this one based on the reviews.  I was really disappointed. There was nothing spectacular about the film.  The cinematography was dull as well as the dialogue. In my opinion it did not live up to his work with Doris Day in Pillow Talk, Lover come back, or, Send Me No Flowers. In a word, boring.",1295222400,4,351,4.223880597014926
772920,4,6304005504,"Although I like the Rock Hudson-Doris Day romantic comedies, Rock and Gina are much more sophisticated and the scripts of both Come September and Strange Bedfellows are much wittier.  And when the Strange Bedfellows characters played by Rock and Gina first reunite after seven years, the celluloid sizzles.  Rock and Gina are both gorgeous.  Rock does double-takes that would do Cary Grant proud, and Gina displays the fabled Italian temper to a fare-thee-well.  Both films are worth re-watching just to laugh and sigh.  There'll never be another Rock Hudson, more's the pity.
I would recommend both Strange Bedfellows and Come September unhesitatingly.",1278979200,7,653,5.362745098039215
772921,4,6304005504,"If you like Rock Hudson, and who doesn't?, you will probably enjoy this oldie starring the Rock and Italian bombshell Gina Lollobrigida. Fortunately, the film has been released on DVD so it'll be around for a long time. The plot is silly but fun as all Rock's romantic comedies are. Best enjoyed with friends and a running commentary on the fashions, morays, and the eternal battle of the sexes.",1269388800,,395,4.739130434782608
772922,3,6304005504,"Although this is not a bad movie, it is not quite as good as I expected.  I loved ""Come September"" which also had Rock Hudson and Gina Lolabrigida in it, so I thought I would see if they had made any other movies together.  ""Strange Bedfellows"" turned out to be the only other film they made together and I ordered it in hopes of finding the same chemistry and humor in it as I had seen in ""Come September"".  I can say this movie was only OK.  If you're looking for a good comedy with these stars, I highly recommend ""Come September"" and wouldn't bother with ""Strange Bedfellows"" unless you are just a major fan of the stars and want it for that purpose alone.",1266364800,6,660,4.256
772923,3,6304005504,"Rock Hudson and Gina Lollobrigida (the former co-stars of 1961's ""Come September"") once again make a smashing team in the cute romantic comedy STRANGE BEDFELLOWS (produced and directed in 1965 by Melvin Frank).

Hudson plays Carter Harrison, a womanising company exec who marries Antonia (Lollobrigida), an Italian spitfire who is heavily into art and politics. When their marriage fails, Carter doesn't hear from Toni for many years, until his boss decides Carter will get a promotion if he can prove that he is a respectable (and, more to the point, MARRIED) man. He decides to lead Toni on to get the promotion but finds himself falling in love with her all over again. The memorable supporting cast includes Terry-Thomas, Nancy Kulp, Gig Young, Arthur Haynes and Edward Judd.

As other reviewers have noted, the film is presented in the wrong widescreen ratio, which will impact you if you own a widescreen television or 16:9 display.  Still, we're lucky to have this movie on DVD in the first place.

The DVD includes the trailer. (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1204329600,25,1070,5.0625
