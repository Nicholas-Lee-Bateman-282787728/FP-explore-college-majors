5777083,2,B009AHO1HC,"I bought this movie solely due to the inclusion within the DVD of a Noah's Ark cartoon.
The animation of both cartoons was less than fine, and once the music sung by the lead characters start to kick in, that's when it's about time to plug your ears. On the other hand, youngsters at around 4 and under shouldn't have much a problem with it.
On the plus side, from a creationist standpoint, is that different from other films in the same category of Noah's Ark, the scenery isn't all desert terrain, which is certainly a good thing!
Overall, irregardless, if you are looking for a masterpiece in animation, this is certainly not it.",1058054400,3,632,4.552631578947368

5777089,1,B009AHO1HC,They took too many liberties from the original story in the Bible. Just my opinion.,1438992000,4,83,4.6
5777090,2,B009AHO1HC,"Special effects were the only good thing about this movie. It was not close to the classical tale, I did not hear the word 'God' used which I found curious, plus the underlying love & hate stories just did not work very well. I did however watch if from beginning to end.",1438560000,2,271,4.230769230769231

5777093,4,B009AHO1HC,"This is a review of the Noah's Ark video only. It is cute and lively--perfect for preschoolers and K, 1. Older kids find it entertaining, too.
You are not going to find perfect doctrine here, but the messages of faith, obedience and trust in God and His promises are clear.
The greedy and the wicked are portrayed as such, without being scary to young children, as well as the consequences that come from refusing
to come into the ark for safety. This is one my own children have been watching for years.",1422230400,,504,4.489130434782608
8590388,1,B009AHO1HC,"there are articles out there that cover it greater detail, done by people that actually did the research; and testing, and such.  I don't recommend the video.  Though the ark is probably Noah's ark, unlike what national discovery tries to miss lead people with.  i do find it interesting to note that archeologies say it doesn't match up in time lines.  I wouldn't expect it to honestly, God doesn't qualify His day; peter is only qualifying that God is outside of time, so how do you track God ideal of time?  You can't.  People try to state well the bible doesn't talk about this or that, and the answer is so; what is your point, the bible is a Love letter written to mankind from a God that wants a relationship with you!  Just cause it has been used extensively to find lost cities and empires, and solves riddles of the ages; well geez, didn't know that was the purpose of our bible.  Get the point, it is suppose to talk about that which clarifies our relationship with our God; the extra is just that, extra.  For the glorification on God!",1513209600,,1047,4.439790575916231
8590389,1,B009AHO1HC,"Not Biblical at all.  I don't like how they introduce romance into children cartoons, takes away from the lesson and it is nonbiblical.",1497312000,,135,4.869565217391305

8590393,1,B009AHO1HC,"The movie is filled with an non-Biblical plot about a love story between Noah's son and the daughter of a fabricated evil king. The actual Noah's ark plot is almost a background story and isn't the focus of much of the movie. The background music is taken from The Nutcracker Suite - very strange. If you want to expose your children to the Bible, this is not the movie for you.",1466553600,3,378,4.338028169014085
