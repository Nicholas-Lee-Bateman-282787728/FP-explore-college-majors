2410111,4,B000BB1MIC,"It happens on many shows that when one or more of the principal characters transitions from high school to college, the series sometimes loses its footing. Gilmore Girls did lose some of what made it loveable from previous seasons in their fourth season.  Though good as always, the fourth season was lacking and it was a new dynamic to get used to.  However, any charm and wit that were lost in the fourth season are reclaimed in Gilmore's fifth and strongest season to date.

Season 5 explores Rory's journey into adulthood as she begins to embrace the life that her mother ran away from. Rory's relationship with the wealthy Logan Huntzberger unnerves her mother as much as it thrills and pleases her grandparents. We also see the long-awaited blossoming (and often tested) romance of Lorelai and Luke.  The audience is also exposed to a side of Richard and Emily that was only hinted at in previous seasons; their obsession with class, breeding and appearances. It manifests itself in horrible ways, driving a wedge between both Rory and Lorelai, as well as Lorelai and her mother with whom she had been on relatively good terms with in season 4.

The bonds between mother and daughter are tested both at the end and the beginning of season 5, in ways never before seen on this loveable, relatable and well-written season. Gilmore Girls has definitely emerged as a series that transcends all ages, races and genders.",1128124800,23,1420,4.827160493827161
2410112,5,B000BB1MIC,"This multi-leveled show cannot be faulted. If I had a teen (or child) and wanted to bond with them over a responsible, stimulating show (or anything) I would choose this!

And Season 5 is so well written and packed full of (and this is essential for dvd purchases) 'Rewindable Moments' - a line you can't quite believe they said relating to something you only thought you and your friends talk about - or an intricately choreographed event slipped into the background action.

In Season 5 Rory, has lost any trace of potentially annoying squat and become more of a flawed grown-up. If you thought her bad-boy boyfriends threw something interesting into the mix, just wait until you meet the fascinating new interest of Logan, who takes us into a jaw-dropping world of what the elite get up to in Connecticut. The added ingredient of this character impacts everything and almost everyone in Rory's life in ways we've never seen before!",1127952000,7,934,4.83125
2410113,5,B000BB1MIC,"After the somewhat downer 4th season, the original Gilmore charm returned with this season.  Rory found her place at Yale, Paris was MUCH less of an annoying roommate than she could have been, and everything in Stars Hollow seemed to be clicking.  This season was just 22 episodes of fun mixed with some excellently written drama.  I don't really believe there is much else to say about this season.  The romance between Lorelai and Luke has been so long in the making that it is finally a huge breath of fresh air to see it come to fruition.  After their little falling out 1/2 through the season, seeing Luke at her door and the two of them kiss made all my roommates and I jump off our couches and scream, ""YYEEESSSS!""  Which may not be that weird to some people, but we are all heterosexual heavy metal loving males.  Why do I mention this?  Because the Gilmore girls works on a level that is attractive to everyone.  Whether you're a middle aged woman, a college aged girl, or a pierced up 20 something male, the Gilmore girls is a fabulously well written and very entertaining show.

The thing I loved most about season 5 is the speed with which the characters quip back and forth to each other.  The dialogue has always been a trademark of what makes the Gilmore girls so special, but after what I viewed as a lackluster season 4, the dialogue really seems to get back on track with season 5.  Between Rory and Logan, the Gilmore grandparents separating and getting back together, Luke and Lorelai, and everything else that goes on, this season had all the right elements to guarantee excellent and witty sentences from everybody!

The Gilmore girls rocks.  If you're not watching or buying this show you are missing out on one of the coolest and most enjoyable things to ever grace television.",1127692800,30,1801,4.5875
2410114,5,B000BB1MIC,"The fifth season of Gilmore Girls might as well be named the Luke-Lorelai season, because basically that's what it was. From their first date, to thier breaking up, to Lorelai popping the question, it is obvious to me that they belong together. The break-up showed that. Luke was miserable without her, trying to find excuses to be near her, and Lorelai couldn't sit up! The whole point of the short break-up was to show that they belong together. It would be a major dissapointment to me if Luke and Lorelai didn't end the series together. After the great Luke-Lorelai romance, where could they go? Bring back Christopher? I don't think so.

On to Rory... seasons 1-3 were basically about Lorelai and Rory. Thier relationship, and being best friends. When Rory went off to college, it was hard for them to stay as close. Despite a few exceptions(Rory visiting Lorelai in bed after Luke breaks up with her) there were few great Lorelai-Rory moments this season.  This makes sense, because Rory is off to college, so some seperation is inevitable. Rory... has changed, and needless to say that has made many Rory fans unhappy. However, I think change is inevitable, especially when going off to college. And you can't blame it all on Logan. Although I don't nesesarrilly condone Rory's actions, I think her changes are more realistic than if should would have stayed exactly the same from ages 16-20.

I liked Logan. I have to say that he was better than Dean, and way better the Jess(the jerk). Logan treats her right, so what he likes to have some fun? What has he really done to Rory or while he was with Rory that was all that bad? He stood up to his family when they attacked her at the dinner. Rory dragged him to steal the yacht, not the other way around. Rory needs to be blamed for her own actions, not Logan.

All that being said, I really hope that they can repair the Lorelai-Rory relationship in season six, and I am pleading with the producers, PLEASE sign Scott Patterson for season 7!

Overall, great season, with more great stuff to come!",1127001600,40,2054,4.631868131868132
2410115,1,B000BB1MIC,"This is it. I enjoyed this show up to this point, but I'm at my limit. What happened, anyway? This show used to be a cute, funny ""dramedy"" that managed to stay rooted in reality despite somewhat far-fetched characters and plotlines. Now, it's all over the place. I can understand that characters need to mature over the course of a show, but Rory's personality change is ridiculous. Suddenly, she's no longer a serious academic, but instead wants to drop out of college, break the law, and sleep around. Meanwhile, several promising storylines go nowhere. Dean has returned, yes, but he's now a scruffy jerk. Luke and Lorelai finally get together, yes, but they sleep together after one date, ruining tons of potential. The list goes on and on. Plus, every episode now includes at least 15 minutes of uninterrupted, near-unintelligible, ""funny"" banter and/or diatribes. The plotlines have become ridiculous, in a failed attempt to be satirical. Once I saw the episode where Dean and Luke get into fisticuffs over a freakin' Bop-It, I was done. And if you respect yourself, you should be done too.",1126915200,19,1096,4.92972972972973
2410116,5,B000BB1MIC,This is television you can watch over and over again. It's so quick and witty I always catch comething I missed before. Not too mention the union of Luke and Lorelai getting better and better!,1126224000,13,192,4.514285714285714
2410117,5,B000BB1MIC,"After a brutal year that left fans guessing up until the last minute whether or not the girls would be back for a fifth season, comes what many fans argue as the best season of the series.

Focussing on Lorelai and Luke's blossoming relationship, as well as Rory's ventures into adulthood with sex and matural relationships, Gilmore girls starts to retreate into the teritory of the first couple years, bringing back the charm that was so veyr much missed over seasons 3 & 4.

Durring the Emmy Nominations times, there was alot of buzz going around about how this coule be the year that Lauren Graham gets a nomination, but eventhough she was overlooked again (in favor of 3 housewives) this season still remains the strongest season to date.

Special Features Include: The 100th Episode with Commentary by Creator Amy-Sherman Paladino (this is the first gilmore commentary!), behind-the-scenes footage, trivia, and more.",1126224000,80,921,5.046052631578948

It is very easy to get swept away into the world of the Gilmores and their friends and family. From quirky, witty, addicted to coffee Lorelai to quiet, intellectual Rory to the hilarious inhabitants of Stars Hollow, this show is full of belly-laughing fun! Season Five is Rory's sophomore year at 'Yale and personally, I enjoyed her college years more than her high school years because it is fun watching her grow and explore the world outside of Stars Hollow. The show is categorized as drama but it also contains so much witty banter. I have all of the seasons and love that I can just grab any season and pop in a disc, knowing that I will enjoy any episode I pick. I absolutely love this show and feel that anyone of any age would enjoy it. I have given seasons of Gilmore Girls to several people as gifts who own them all now as well and enjoy the show as much as I do!

2410181,3,B000BB1MIC,"Season five seems to be a candidate for worst season of the whole series ... then two years later, season 7 appears. You would think, with Luke and Lorelai now together, that things could only get better? Well, not if you consider the law of averages. In most shows, when you take out the mysterious romantic undertones, they commonly start emulating a satisfied, smug, overweight couple. Boring, with few redeeming values. If anything, this season is ushering in the inevitable finale, which is ""shockingly"" only two seasons away. Yep, we've jumped the shark, folks. Rory's college life is still about as boring as season four and her new beau is just really more trouble than he's worth. The one good thing about Rory, when it comes to Lorelai, is that the younger's love life at least helps to make her mother's a bit less pathetic. The only really redeeming value of the season is the most shocking season finale of the entire series, which has to do with Rory and starts at her internship.",1428278400,,994,4.718390804597701

2410347,4,B000BB1MIC,"I started watching this show when it first aired and for some reason strayed away after season 3.  I just purchased all of the seasons I missed and I must say that I missed a lot!

I agree with all other reviewers who said that this was one of the most unique, diaglogue rich, character driven dramedies to come along in a long while.  It lasted for seven seasons because of the stellar writing and the talent laden cast filled with rising stars and veterans. Melissa McCarthy is a comedic dynamo and she and Lauren Graham have fabulous comedic chemistry. Yanic Truesdale's deadpan deliveries are genius when paired with either or both.

I applaud Amy Sherman-Palladino for her brave decision to take Rory's character on a totally unexpected detour and let us all watch her find her way back, learn from her mistakes and mature in the process. Life's lessons 101...much more realistic and it made for good drama!

Alexis Bledel is a fantastic young actress and I was in tears when she went to her Grandpa and burst into tears sobbing ""Everything's falling apart...I've messed everything up and I don't know what to do!"".

Oh, the irony that Jess was the only one who could penetrate her ""drop-out stupor"", and get her  moving in the right direction again.

In my opinion, Logan's character was the perfect college love interest for Rory.  He challenged her and brought her out of her shell and she met his challenges head-on and calmed him down. Logan was like a combination of Dean and Jess, He had a sweet, protective and chivalrous side, like Dean(but with a future); and a well read bad-boy side, like Jess(but with a trust fund). We saw his character mature beyond the spoiled, dare-devil-party boy we first met, with some bumps along the way, which he rebounded from also. It seemed that their story was in no way finished. That would be the perfect basis for a movie, if there was one. :)

I've always loved the snappy dialogue and I totally get many of the pop culture references sprinkled throughout this series. The entire series is a testament to life as a modern woman.",1319932800,,2081,4.66120218579235
2410348,5,B000BB1MIC,"If you are even thinking about buying season 5 of Gilmore Girls then you probably know the show pretty well, or are buying it for someone who does. This season keeps up with the fast-talking girls, witty one liners, and drama that you expect from the show.

I will advise viewers that haven't seen the show from this point on that, although all the elements that make this show great are there, the show really starts to lose a little bit of it's charm as Rory and Lorelai spend less time together. The mother and daughter really start to have separate story lines, and this can be kind of bumpy. However, when they are together (and getting along) it is perfect.

This is my favorite show of all time, and I still miss it. I have all the seasons, and watch it with friends who haven't seen the show all the time. It's undeniable charm and fast paced wit wins over anyone who can keep up. And if you think you know pop culture, this show will test your knowledge. I have many times paused the show to Google a name, or event reference that left me saying, ""What!?!""

If you already love this show, I recommend Reba and I Love Lucy. Both of these shows have great elements of Gilmore Girls. (Don't blow off the Reba show just because you are not a country music fan. I don't care for her music, but she has one of the most natural comedic timing I have seen since Lucy. She plays a mom of 3 kids, an ex-wife trying to deal with the new wife, and a soon to be grandmother. The writing of this show is only outshined by Gilmore Girls)",1316390400,,1531,4.254295532646048

The only good thing about this season is that Luke and Lorelai are finally dating. Rory is no longer the smart, innocent girl we liked in the earlier seasons. Instead, she's only interested in trapping herself a boyfriend and sleeping around. Her relationship with her mom is extremely two-dimensional, and the witty banter that was such a delight in other seasons is now slow, lacking in references, and just plain boring.

It's the pressures of Yale and the upper-crusty Huntzbergers that finally cause Rory to veer off-course towards the end of this season. You'll notice that she starts to drink more, for one thing.

Such abstention is bad for the soul) nor does she really fool around with young men.  The show started to go wrong when Rory decided to go to Yale instead of Harvard; the result? NOTHING CHANGED. Rory was home every other episode, it was Chilton+.  Nothing new.

I have truly missed this show since it went off-air. Since I was only able to purchase the first four seasons a year ago, FINALLY getting my hands on this season was a reminder of why it was such a tragedy that Amy Sherman-Palladino left after the sixth season and the show fizzled in the seventh season.

During my holiday at the end of July untill the second week of August I watched every episode of every season . It only took that long as I had to order two seasons from America.
Season 5 carried on the legacy of season 4 I was not dissapointed with my purchase. Lorelai and luke , Rory and Yale , Gilmore Girls and Gilmore parents things moved on and I wanted to know where they were going each episode drew me into the next the banta was there as always and the fast talking .

2410439,5,B000BB1MIC,"Hyperbole? No. Gilmore Girls is one of those rare creations on TV or any media really where the characters are so well fleshed out they are real. I can not draw. When I try to draw a human face it ends up looking like a cat drew it or a 2-year old. Most TV is that way. Characters are distorted, lamed-down, absurd imitations of human beings. Quite depressing actually. It is why I read or watch sports.

Once in awhile lo and behold REAL PEOPLE on TV. Quirky people. Quirky people who are belivable. The main characters are flawed, intelligent, interesting, amusing, and aware. The quirky supporting cast is just as believable and endearing.

This year we get to see Rory dealing with relationships on a deeper more emotional level both with boyfriends and her mom. And there is more Luke and Lorelai together. Good stuff.

There has been talk of a Gilmore Girls movie filling in the time since we last have seen them. Also talk of Alexis not wanting to do it. It doesn't matter. Once you get hooked on the series you will know these characters as well as the writers and the actors. And that is some mighty fine writing to achieve that.

The Emmys should be ashamed of itself. The series was virtually over-looked except for a 'statue' episode. Almost nothing receiving an Emmy the forst years of the new decade could come close to this. Series is so good I gave it a 5 but it should as a DVD be closer to a 4 or even a 3. Not a lot of extras. Fans deserve more when they shell out money, especially as many have watched the episodes before.

But if you want to introduce someone new to them or watch them commerical free whenever you want. Or just have them on hand when a child is old enough to watch them, good buy.",1217808000,,1720,4.345794392523365

At the end of Season Four, Rory [Alexis Bledel] sleeps with her married ex-boyfriend Dean [Jared Padalecki] and the beginning of Season Five sees Rory being 'sent' off on a European tour with her grandma Emily [Kelly Bishop], a ruse by Lorelai [Lauren Graham] hoping that things will cool between Rory and Dean.

The plot twists in this season are fascinating - Rory eventually finds herself drifting apart from Dean, and drawn towards rich kid, Logan Huntzbeger [Matt Czuchry] which delight the senior Gilmores but not Lorelai. Luke and Lorelai's relationship grows from strength to strength, with some major hiccups in between, no thanks to the interference of Emily Gilmore [Kelly Bishop] and Christopher.

The last two episodes of this season truly keeps you riveted as a dejected Rory turns to a desperate act that lands her not only in trouble with the law but also causes a rift between her and her mother, Lorelai.

The writing is as good as ever and the acting superb. This is a great season that is sure to delight fans and new viewers alike.",1196208000,,1138,4.795918367346939

TV is for escaping.  The Gilmore Girls help you to escape into a made up town of Stars Hollow, where there is almost always, a happy ending.",1193097600,,422,4.134146341463414

2410463,4,B000BB1MIC,"Just 16 years apart, Rory Gilmore and her mother Lorelai are best friends. They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.

In Season 1, 16-year-old Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.

Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark throughout the seasons -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.

Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Sookie, chef at the Independence Inn, which Lorelai manages; Kirk, a quirky ""townie"" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. Rory's father Christopher is also around sporadically, as he and Lorelai fight an attraction which has intertwined throughout their lives, but never seems to work out.

In this season, Rory embarks on an affair with her ex-boyfriend Dean, who married the past season. Her actions drive her and her mother apart - as well as many fans, who viewed Rory's decisions as completely un-Rorylike. But meanwhile, Rory's also fighting an attraction to rich bad-boy Logan, a fellow member of the Yale newspaper and a mysterious campus secret society. Sookie learns she's pregnant with her second child, Luke's and Lorelai's relationship grows more serious, and the elder Gilmores announce their separation.

Although the show is supposedly set in Connecticut, the writers and producers never really make that believable to a native (i.e. Rory and Lorelai walking around with thin coats, wide open, supposedly in the middle of winter. Still, I can overlook that -- it's fun having one of my favorite shows set in my own state. That way, I almost feel like I might really bump into a Stars Hollow resident somewhere along my way... :-)",1175644800,,2666,5.147806004618937
2410464,5,B000BB1MIC,I bought my GF all seasons of the Gilmore Girls and it keeps her quite happy.  Very addicting series and a fair price from Amazon.,1173312000,,130,4.2
2410465,2,B000BB1MIC,"Season 5 of Gilmore Girls was disappointing. Mostly, because I really loathed the direction the writers took with Rory, the boring Luke/Lorelai pairing and Ritchie Rich, um, er.. Logan character. The only bright points in this season was the development of Lane, the ending of the relationship between Paris and that creepy professor, and the dragonfly inn.

First my peeves: I found Rory incredibly obnoxious this season. She started off as such a wholesome, nice girl, but has slowly become an obnoxious rich brat. Her treatment of her Grandmother, her insensitivity to Dean, and the the way she behaves  is just rude and callous. I really expected more from her. Plus, what I like about this series is the small town atmosphere. The richer than God friends Rory has been hanging out with make me feel like I'm watching Dynasty.

Lorelai has regressed to about 13. Since when does Lorealai need protection by her daughter? The Luke/Lorelai pairing bored me. I just don't see any chemistry there. Luke's treatment of Dean was obnoxious. I found it difficult to believe that Lorelai and Rory wouldn't have some issue with that. Okay, so they give their own mother the cold shoulder for playing matchmaker and don't get annoyed with Luke for trying to engineer Rory's relationship....Okay.

The girls were hypocritical and irritating this season. I'm hoping season 6 is better. Thank god this was just a rental.",1171584000,6,1410,4.987234042553191

Why oh WHY won't the writers let her be married, and stay married to someone wonderful? Like Luke? He was/is perfect for her... Sigh...",1171324800,3,536,4.944444444444445

I do not feel that Logan would be a good match forever, but it is nice to see her stepping out of her comfort zone and having to work for something as well as have fun in college, which I think is a better portrayal of college life.

Rory dates Dean, meets Logan, breaks up with Dean, gets together with Logan, gets arrested, drops out of school.

I personally felt that the third and fourth seasons had ruined all hope for the show (in my eyes at least), as they were quite clearly less enjoyable from a male's perspective, and quite a bit more ""girly"".

I haven't finished the fifth season yet, but from what I can see, things are looking up for the comedic value of this Warner Brothers ""classic-in-the-making"".",1153785600,,627,4.743119266055046

Luke and Lorelai start dating and their romance blossoms throughout the season, Rory meets Logan, Paris and Doyle even start dating, and the same mother/daughter relationship between Lorelai and Rory exists throughout.  It's a little of a tear - jerker at the end of this season because Rory ends up in jail for stealing a yacht and has to go to court for it, and she also ends up quitting Yale because she feels she can't be a journalist (watch the season for details; I'm not giving those away.)  Lorelai's left alone in the dark when Rory decides to move into the poolhouse with her grandparents.  Overall, this is a great season not to be missed and I'd recommend it to all Gilmore fans!",1148515200,6,724,4.589147286821706
2410490,2,B000BB1MIC,"In my opinion, season 5 is when the girls start their not-so-graceful swandive to mediocrity. The emphasis of the show turns to Yale and Richard and Emily and the Huntzbergers so much so that the show is starting to resemble a ""Who's who of upper class Conneticut"" advertisement. Less and less time is spent in Stars Hollow, and former regulars on the show don't get the airtime they deserve. Suki, Jackson, Miss Patty, Babette (what happened to Maury anyway? He's simply disappeared from the show!) and even Taylor are rare sights these days.

It's hard to complain about Lorelia's character, on her own she's fabulous. But when paired with Luke? The show has deflated noticably since this unfortunate turn.

The same goes for Rory. Once a strong, independent character, she has been reduced to half of the Logan/Rory combination. By making the two women of the show half of a couple takes away from the girl power message the show started out with. They now need men to save them, like Luke loaning Lorelai the money and Logan (in season 6) sweeping in to save the paper just hours before publication.

The show was at its peak when it revolved around Stars Hollow. Season five isn't all bad, but it's the beginning of the end. Season 6 has bright spots, but they are few and far between. Who knows what will happen once Amy and Dan Palladino leave after this season? It's sad when a show overstays its welcome, as this one is in danger of doing.",1146009600,7,1448,4.626459143968872
2410491,3,B000BB1MIC,"I realized that the quality of this show had greatly diminished by the fact that I found myself fast-forwarding repeatedly on the last 3 dvd's of this season.

I have always loved Gilmore Girls since Season 1, but I was so disappointed with Season 5, that I looked up the show's Episode Guide and read Season 6 synopses to determine whether it's worth it for me to buy it when it comes out.

While Lorelei continues to be a strong character and Lauren Graham continues to shine portraying her; I found the plot lines to be dull, forced and plain boring.

Unlike everyone else out there, I don't like Luke and Lorelei together.  For me Lorelei's best match was Max.  It was a pleasure seeing them together.  Luke belongs in the ""best friend category"" and as a good contrast to Lorelei's sunny disposition.  I found their scenes together forced and did not enjoy watching them together.

I got tired of so many scenes by Doose, Kirk and all the silly characters which were funny before but now have been pushed to an extreme on the silly meter.

The actress who plays Sookie, who is usually superb was, awful during the election of her husband to town's rep.  She looks like she's acting.....

Completely unbelievable that Lane and Zach got together, especially knowing they marry them off in Season 6.  Ridiculous!!!!

The positive this season?  LOGAN.  He was a pleasure to watch, and the mix between his good and ""bad"" sides were perfect.  I enjoyed all the scenes between him and Rory.  The screen lit up everytime he was on.  I am glad to see he continues to be very present in season 6.  BUT PLEASE, need to improve the kissing scenes between Logan and Rory.  We're not watching a 1930's movie!!!!.  Go back and watch Rory and Jess kissing, and then have Rory and Logan do the same.

Rory's character had the most changes.  It was good to see her making some bad decisions as she was just too perfect to be true.  But I don't think the actress was up to the needed performance.  I have a hard time accepting her as a 19-year old.  Also,PLEASE do something about her wardrobe and hair.  She looks 14 most of the time.

So, in conclusion, maybe it's time for me to say good-bye to the Gilmore girls....In any case, if I keep watching it will be for Lauren Graham, who has been a wonderful and consistent Lorelei, for Logan and Rory together (I think the writers can help the actress who plays Rory to evolve in her role),  and that's about it.",1145491200,3,2445,4.480725623582766
2410492,5,B000BB1MIC,"First let me say that I love this show. It's smart, funny, and always entertaining. But I thought that Season 5 was lacking some of that spirit that I loved about the first few seasons. I definitely disagree with the commonly accepted thought that Season 4 was a transition season, understandably a little weak, etc etc, and that Season 5 took the show back to it's beginnings. Personally, I don't find Season 5 at all nostalgic or reminiscent of the early Gilmore Girls days. [SPOILERS below]

My biggest complaint is the amount of sex in this season. Something I always liked about the show was how clean it was, even in Season 3 when Rory introduced the subject of possibly sleeping with Jess and Lorelai's frequent insertions of ""Ooh, dirty!"". I understand that the show needs to mature, along with Rory and with its original teenaged audience, but personally, there were several times during this season when I was uncomfortable to be watching with my younger sister.

I also thought that some of the loose ends needed to be tied up a little bit better. Dean just dropped out of Rory's life - after he had pined for her and then proceeded to cheat on his wife for her, he just walked away. Jackson was elected town selectman and presided over a town meeting - and then Taylor does not call a recall election like he said, instead he acts like nothing is wrong and is back handling the town museum and Luke's house purchase. I also felt Sookie's pregnancy could have been much more momentous than it was.

On the plus side, Richard and Emily's seperation and reconciliation was handled well, as was Rory's process of falling for Logan. This season had some great moments: Kirk singing ""Do You Love Me?"" during Fiddler on the Roof was priceless.

I don't know if watching Season 6 will give me new perspective on where the writers were heading when they wrote the episodes in Season 5. I still adore this show, but I have a feeling that my disc sets of Seasons 2 and 3 will see a lot more use than Season 5 will.",1143244800,5,2015,4.527472527472527
2410493,5,B000BB1MIC,I feel this is the best DVD Season for Gilmore Girls.  It shows how Rory is starting to mature and take lot of chances.

Season 5 finally gives us what we've been waiting for for 4 years:  Luke and Lorelai.  Though there are bumps along the way, the season ends with quite the surprise!

The rest of the cast is, as usual, fantastic and you can't help but love them all.  This is one of the best ensemble casts on TV in a very long time.  While Lorelai and Rory are the main characters, they couldn't exist without the rest of Star's Hollow or their family.

2410515,5,B000BB1MIC,"Okay, maybe I'm being a little critical there. At this point in the show's run, with Rory having one year of college under her belt and witnessing an undeniable rift in the mother/daughter dynamic in Season 4, I think it was important to add more than a twinge of humanity to Rory's character in this pivotal Season 5.

Season 4 was clearly not Gilmore Girls' best year, perhaps mostly because the relationship between mother and daughter had to undergo a significant change with the separation caused by Rory's entrance into college. As all avid fans know, Rory maintained her squeaky-clean, sweet little girl next door image throughout that season, right up to the season finale....and then she fell flat on her face with a decision that stunned everyone. In Season 5, we get to bear witness to her reaction to her big mistake (a reaction that you might not expect from her), and she goes back for her second year at Yale as a much more human college kid. She parties more, breaks out of her shell, and truly separates from that sweet and youthful image with a choice in the season finale that, just like the 4th season finale, left all viewers speechless (maybe even more so this time around). Now, of course, in the current Season 6, Rory is most definitely a very different person than she was portrayed as the first four years of the show, and although it is disappointing to many Rory fans, it is a dramatic shift in character that clearly began its unwinding in this Season 5.

A renaissance of a year for Rory Gilmore, indeed....but let's not forget Lorelai, either. Not only does she finally get her dream inn, the Dragonfly, underway with a highly successful test run and a booming first year of business, but she gets something else that's pretty major. Indications of the chemistry and concealed love between Luke and Lorelai have been evident to the naked eye since the pilot episode of Season 1, and now we FINALLY get to see this formulate into a romantic relationship. The strength of this season lies arguably in the bond that these two share. It's something that fans have wanted for a very long time, and with the developments occurring in Season 6, it appears that this couple will make for some very high quality television.

Season 5 is certainly a season to purchase if you are a big fan of the show. A strong metamorphosis takes place with the characters as they settle into their changes in distance and personal relationships, the show becomes something far different from what we enjoyed in the first few seasons and truly becomes respectable and powerful in its own right.",1141689600,,2601,4.699561403508772
2410516,5,B000BB1MIC,"The quick, witty dialogue of Gilmore Girls is an homage to screwball comedy films like His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby.  It works surprising well, largely because there are different levels of speed talking: Some characters can keep up, others get lost, and some try on certain days and prefer to be normal people on other days.  References and allusions abound as well.  Some of the cultural references are highly obscure - that is, even with your ability to pause and rewind the world of Gilmore Girls, there are times when even the viewer can't keep up.  This is all part of the fun of a dialogue-driven comedy that serves its main characters far too much coffee and a hilarious amount of food.

When the plot turns serious and the dialogue slows down, the sparkling planned community shimmers away as the stuff of real life creates drama.  I appreciate that the writers understand the need to feel drama slowly.  You can't banter through it, because only happy people relish in clever games.

It's hard to explain how a show about mostly white, middle class people living in a crime-free fantasy has become so popular, especially on the WB, which has been one of the few channels to embrace all of America's cultures, races, classes, and so on.  I think the answer is that the relationship between a single mother and her daughter and an absentee father is highly translatable to many Americans.  There are many conversations detailing Lorelai's struggles to provide for her daughter.  Viewers also empathize with the weird and uncomfortable encounters with rich, elitist people, namely, Lorelai's parents.

The DVDs are somewhat lacking in extras - a making-of video and some extended or extra scenes are all you get.  I think fans of the show would enjoy a dialogue dictionary of all of the references the characters make, a list of the books Rory and Jess are always reading, a map of Stars Hollow, a coffee cup, and Sookie's recipes.",1141430400,2,1946,4.807807807807808

2410532,4,B000BB1MIC,"To be honest I only ever heard of Gilmore Girls one time before when the mother and daughter of the series were mocked by the Family Guy and my wife had a quick retort to the show's defense. Then, not a week later, she begged me to buy her this box set for Christmas. In some ways I'm glad I did, and in others I'm kicking myself at the same time for not just buying her Season 1, as I'm still kind of lost at the moment entering a series so late into it's over all drama.

In my research, prior to watching season five I learned that this show's premise is supposed to be a mother and daughter who are so close that people mistake them for sisters. Something must have gone horribly wrong along the way because in Season Five I felt that there was a sharp wedge between Lorelei and Rory... a huge sharp wedge. I don't know if that was there all along, or if it's new, but I felt a mother desperately trying to get close to her daughter, only to be pushed away by the 19 year old.

To be honest this show was a mixed bag for me, again coming into it so late, though my wife was very excited to receive this Christmas present, and was able to hop right into the set I took longer to get my bearings in the story, and have come to certain conclusions that may not accurately reflect the series as a whole.

Firstly, that the show opened up with Rory helping what I later earned is her ex-boyfriend commit adultery didn't exactly put her in a favorable light with me, and said ex-boyfriend, Derek, seemed to have a really sweet, very loving wife who was desperate to please him, and crushed when she learned of his infidelity. This did not put him in a favorable light with me either. Neither character found redemption with me throughout the season, especially with the huge decision that Rory has to make when Preppy boy Logan comes into the picture (who looks freakishly like the guy I sit behind at work I might add...) I did not find a single redeeming quality to Rory, and I came to really detest Derek. I'm not too fond of Rory's grandmother either who is even more shallow and self absorbed than she is!

Thankfully, there's Lorelei who is funny, charming, and witty, and (According to my wife) finally with the guy of her dreams and they exhibit some amazing chemistry. I especially enjoyed the episode where the whole town finds out that they are together, and how the town reacts to it, and how they react to their reaction! It was a very funny episode. Lorelei is what made this season so enjoyable for me as she did for Gilmore Girls what Qui Gon Jin did for Star Wars Episode 1, held the show together, and prevented it from becoming un-enjoyable. You see, unlike her daughter and her mother, Lorelei is not shallow, hollow, and self-serving. She's quite the opposite in fact. There were numerous occasions where it was tempting for me to forward through Rory's scenes just to get back to her mother again. She does an excellent job keeping an otherwise stale story afloat, and making it actually entertaining! The show is slower paced, and more character driven, but as long as you don't mind that you'll probably find this series enjoyable.

Perhaps the biggest head scratching moment I had was when I read the back of the package and noticed a small add for the series' sound track... The music is used very rarely, and what is there is uninspired. Numerous heavily dramatic moments passed in this season where (especially with Rory) I just wasn't feeling it from the actors, this lack of feeling could have been eliminated with some dramatic score, an acoustic guitar... anything, But in most cases there was nothing. I suppose after 5 season you might have enough licensed material for a single CD, but don't expect much from the show itself.

The sound was decent for what it is; plenty loud on its own merits, but lacking any explosions and anything fancy like that it doesn't really need anything big sound wise so it delivers for what it is. The video is light years better than the grainy mess that was American Gothic, but its still not as clean as say 24 (Insert whatever season you choose) and for the sharp trained eye be warned there are frame rate drops which causes the camera movement and the action on the screen to appear somewhat choppy. Its very subtle, and having worked in film editing myself, most likely the result of the way it was filmed (probably digital) rather than the video transfer. This effect is less noticeable on a smaller screen, and isn't as bad as the first couple seasons of Deep Space Nine where any sharp movement of the actors or the camera caused significant choppiness in the presentation, as well as a motion blur. Gilmore Girls Season 5's frame rate dips are nowhere near that bad, but are noticeable on a big screen like mine, and my wife noticed them as well. Again people running this on a smaller TV (Like DS9 before it) may not find it all that noticeable.

In all honesty this is not a show I would have been drawn to on my own, but like I said I am glad I got introduced to it. It's one of the WB's better efforts, and although some of the lead characters seem shallow and self-serving they can be pretty true to life. I've lived in small towns, I know people like Lorelei and Rory, for better or worse, and so it's easy to get drawn into the show because of that. My recommendation is that this show is best for fans, or for folks who don't mind slower paced, more character driven shows, and especially for folks who live in smaller rural areas. I'll probably pick up the other seasons gradually myself, as I identify greatly with Luke and my wife, incidentally, has a personality very similar to Lorelei, which makes the show that much more enjoyable for us both. Plus its nice to have a show that we can both agree on, since she usually detests the horror shows I like to watch.",1138579200,2,5849,4.435348837209302
2410533,5,B000BB1MIC,I truly loved the Fifth Season of Gilmore Girls. The writing is amazing for all the characters. The little twists and turns kept my attention. It makes you want to just sit and watch all the episodes in one sitting. The actors are wonderful as in all seasons. It is very difficult not to get hooked on the Gilmore Girls and entire cast.,1138492800,,336,4.349206349206349
2410544,5,B000BB1MIC,"I've been reading some of the reviews for Gilmore Girls: Season 5 and I have noticed some very akward reviews. Such as I noticed a few that complained about packaging. There was ever a couple that were simply rude and un-neccisairy. Well I'm out to give all of you fans of the show a real review.

The fifth season deals alot with the Lorelai-Luke relationship and Rory begining her journey to adulthood.

Many fans have been waiting for the Lorelai-Luke relationship to begin. Now that it has I feel that it has completed the show!

It made many people happy, but to some it was wrong,wrong,wrong.

In this season Emily (who was finally getting along with Lorelai in the 4th season) tries (and almost succeeds) to ruin the Lorelai-Luke relationship. But instead ends up breaking the Lorelai-Emily relationship. Such as the wedding episode where Christopher gets in a verbal fight with Luke and tells Lorelai that Emily said he still had a chance.

This season brings great change for Rory as she trys to find out who she is. This big change starts at the end of the 4th season when Rory sleeps with her married ex-Dean. Which creates a huge gap between her and Lorelai. Then Rory meets Logan, a rich frat boy (the kind of boy we thought she would never fall for). Which also dousn't help Lorelai. At the end of the season Rory and Logan steal a boat and get put in jail. Rory then drops out of Yale. But at the very end is the biggest slap of all for Lorelai when her parents tell her Rory will be moving into their poolhouse.

The 4th Season was a bit of a drag. But the 5th season brought it all back! This is one of my favorites seasons! If i could i would give it 5 million stars! So OY WITH THE POODLES ALREADY!

Get off your butt and buy it now!",1136505600,2,1752,4.355828220858895
2410545,5,B000BB1MIC,"The fourth season of ""Gilmore Girls"" was my least favorite to date because essentially Lorelia and Rory spent the year treading water.  The finale of the third season, ""Those Are Strings, Pinocchio,"" was when Luke had the dream about Lorelia asking him not to go on the cruise with Nicole, which created a nice bookend with the third season premier, ""Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days,"" when Lorelia had the dream about Luke. Clearly something was being set up for the fourth season, but the payoff was deterred all the way until the final episode, at which point Luke finally kissed Lorelia, Lorelia kissed him back, and then Rory went and lost her virginity to Dean, who happened to be married to Lindsay.  Obviously the series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino is well aware of all those romantic comedies that died as soon as the bickering couples consummated their love (""Moonlighting"" being the paradigmatic example of such a fate).  Still, waiting until the end of the fourth season to have Luke and Lorelai finally kiss was sheer agony.

Between the first kisses and the consummation devoutly to be wished, the impediments came from other Gilmores.  ""Goodbye to Daisy Miller"" has Lorelai worried about Rory and Dean, and then learning that her parents are separated.  Fortunately Emily takes Rory to Europe and this actually gives Lorelai and Luke the necessary alone time.  Ultimately ""Gilmore Girls: The Complete Fifth Season"" is about cementing the ties that bind between Luke and Lorelai.  By the end of this season they have become one in every way that matters short of cohabitation and marriage, and are clearly moving in those directions.  All of the best moments in this season have to do with those two, while Rory gets thrown off track by falling into the orbit of Logan Huntsburger and his family.

The fifth season has several of my all-time favorite moments in the series to date and two moments when I was a-feared the show was jumping the shark.  My first favorite moment comes in ""Written in the Stars"" when Luke and Lorelai go on their first date, he recalls the first time they met, and shows her what is in his wallet.  Of course he is all in.  Then there is the moment at the end of ""Wedding Bell Blues,"" when Lorelai has learned from Christopher that Emily was encouraging him to rekindle their romance.  As Lorelai was being dragged over for the wedding photography I was yelling at my television for Lorelia to ""nuke"" her mother, by which I meant to pull out the biggest nuclear device in her possession and drop it on Emily, which, I believe is exactly what she does.  There was a close call for another great moment off of this plot line when Rory blows up at her grandmother in ""So...Good Talk,"" but it fell short of my requirements (I want Rory to say to Emily, just once, ""Grandmother, I love you a whole lot, but no matter what you do or what happens I will never love you more than I love my mom"").  My second favorite moment is the end of ""A House is Not a Home,"" and I am talking not only of Lorelia's final question of the season but the whole range of thoughts and emotions that Lorelai goes through right before she pops the question.  Why Lauren Graham does not at least get nominated for an Emmy for Best Actress in a Comedy Series is beyond comprehension (but neither did Sarah Michelle Gellar or any other actress from the WB).

My first fears of shark jumping proved to be a false alarm, but in the wake of the wedding debacle I did not buy it when Luke tells Lorelai in ""Say Something"" that they could not be together.  As the town elder points out in ""Blame Booze and Melville,"" Luke has been waiting for Lorelai for a long time and he should be able to weather the perpetual hurricane that is Emily Gilmore.  Fortunately Lorelia's phone call at the end of the episode changes the dynamic (Look at Luke's face: I swear he is ready to take her back right then).  I should point out that my third favorite moment of the season is what accompanies Judy Garland singing ""The Man Who Got Away"" from ""A Star is Born"" at the end of ""So... Good Talk.""

However, I had much greater concerns over what happens in ""Blame Booze and Melville"" when Mitchum Huntzberger lowers the boom on Rory and she decides to drop out of Yale.  I personally think that a gopher/intern should keep their mouth shut in meetings of the senior staff at a newspaper.  In the sixth season in ""We've Got Magic to Do"" it is suggested that Mitchum actually believes what he is saying, but I still find it hard to believe.  But the resulting split between Lorelai and Rory is really the province of the sixth season, and while I agree that the dramatic consequences of such a rift was worth pursuing at this point in the series, I simply think that dropping out of Yale and moving in with grandma and grandpa was not the way to go (I waited in vain for Paris to really read Rory the riot act).  But as the nadir of the series plays out against Claudin Longet singing ""I Think It's Going To Rain"" when Rory turns away from her mother, it also serves to set up the beauty of the cliffhanger that was never a cliffhanger.

""Wedding Bell Blues"" was the show's 100th episode so it gets special treatment with the DVD extras here.  However, the main thing is that we are now caught up with all five seasons out on DVD during the sixth season of ""Gilmore Girls.""

2410548,5,B000BB1MIC,"You know, I'm a little late in reviewing this season of Gilmore Girls, and all of the previous reviewers are right on the money, but I thought I share in the Gilmore love fest here.

There are so many monumental scenes and occasions in this season that make it such a must-see and in my case a must re-watch over and over! The season builds-up momentum and really hit's stride when marking it's 100th episode anniversary, (that was a great episode) and I have to agree with many, Lauren Graham deserves Emmy consideration! Nonetheless, many Luke and Lorelai fans will adore this season because the best stuff really comes from them.  Emily is meaner then ever, Paris is just as nuts as she always is and yes, Rory has a new love interest, there's just one problem he doesn't commit well.

Honestly the last episode of this season is the best of the series so far.  I can't wait to watch them all over again, because I know there will be something I'll notice that I didn't catch before.

If your unsure of investing in the Gilmore Girl sets then watch an episode of season 6 airing now, which is turning out to be, believe it or not, even better then season 5! It's already a shoe in for a 7th season and deserves all the praise it's getting, and all the praise the writers are getting for making us the fans fall in love with these characters all over again. There is no doubt in my mind that this series will eventually end with just as much whit, spunk, charm, warmth, and popularity as it did when it began and when that sad day comes I will have a complete set of one of the most fabulously crafted shows to ever grace our TV sets.  Again, I am amazed at how these actors and writers make us feel so much in such a short amount of time. Time now, we can relive again and again whenever we please.",1134518400,4,1801,4.297935103244837
2410549,5,B000BB1MIC,"""Gilmore Girls: Season 5"" is the best season yet of this beloved show for one simple reason: Luke and Lorelai.  It finally happens, but not without struggle and heartbreak.  This season is also a little controversial because Rory begins her downward spiral which only ends(?) with her bottoming out in season 6.  My favorite episode is probably ""Wrtten in the Stars"", a lovely, deceptively sweet show when Luke ardently proclaims his love and Lorelai is subtly equivocal, thus setting up the smash-up in the middle of the season.  Other soon to be legendary episodes are ""Wedding Bell Blues"", the 100th episode, when Emily and Christopher nearly succeed in destroying Luke and Lorelai; ""Pulp Friction"", the real reconciliation episode; and of course the season finale ""A House is Not a Home"", where Rory finally loses it after a mind screw-over courtesy of the Huntzberger family. (I wonder; is that supposed to remind us of the Sulzbergers of the ""New York Times""?  What did that newspaper ever do to Amy Sherman-Palladino, hmm?)  This is just a classic TV series, and I shouldn't have to remind men that it features two very hot actresses; winsome Alexis Bledel, and the staggeringly charismatic Lauren Graham.  If you are looking for a place to begin with the ""Gilmore Girls world, season 5 is a choice place to start.",1134345600,7,1321,4.923423423423423
2410550,5,B000BB1MIC,"Season Four fizzled for me.  Other than the last 4 episodes, I didn't really enjoy it.  (Of course, I own that one, too!)

But season five?  Whoa, mama!  Season five is the best yet.  We finally see Rory turning into a person.  After having an affair with her (married) ex-boyfriend, we now see that she is not the naive teenager we came to know and love in her Chilton years.  Drama, drama, drama, drama is included in Rory's storyline.  She's growing into a regular college student -- you guys know what I mean -- and she's doubting herself.  Not a good thing, but ASP pulls it off beautifully!  And the LL relationship!  The one we've been waiting for for five long years.  It's wonderful to see them finally together.  ASP pulls off their rough patch in the second half of the season wonderfully.  This season is the best yet!  BUY BUY BUY!",1133222400,7,844,4.453947368421052

Season 5 is wittier funnier better writing, fueds, hookups, great oneliners and so much more. This DVD box set has great special features including commentary and a gmae with all the hilarious diolouge in this season. But this show carries itself. It doesn't need any speical features for me to purchase it, all you need is a sence of humor, 80's trivia and your set!!! Gilmore Girls is the WBs best show for several reasons. It has evrything you need to make tuesday nights at 8 a snake and party night. Converting your friends shouldn't be hard and it has cult written all over it. The acting is phenominal. Lauren Grahm deserves and Emmy and so much more. She has already won like 2 actor screen guild awards and more. Kikeo Agenda is amazing. She plays the character so well. She has become my tv icon. Rock on Lane! The only downpart about it is that Logan is in the series. I wish they would have got a better actor for the thing but thats ok. The rest of the series pulls it off. Luke, renisance, proposals, and so much more gilmore Girls season 5 and all other gilmore girls items too are a must buy right now. BUY BUY BUY",1133136000,,1258,4.380341880341881
2410552,5,B000BB1MIC,"I don't think we are watching the same series.  Emily never left Richard in order to get Loreli back, she left him because they fought about everything recently, and she was feeling usless. She was ticked at him and that was that.  Emily was her own worst enemy where Loreli was concerned.  She had her moments, which always touched me, but her moments were never at the right time, nor long enough to help her.  It was not Digger's lawsuit, it was his father's lawsuit. And everyone knew it was never going to totally ruin Richard.  He is too smart for that.

This series is full of real life, and totally believable people. I feel sometimes like trying to find Stars Hollow on a map!  I wish it really existed, because that is where I would move to if it did. I love this show, and I hope that it does not stop with season 6.  I also hope that when it does stop, as I suppose all series must someday, that it will end with a resolution to everyone's lives, where everything is perfect.  Sounds drippy?  Well, that is what we all need.  Hope.",1132617600,3,1043,4.297435897435897
2410553,5,B000BB1MIC,"This show is so well done, it trascends genres--like the Godfather is the great American film because it works on multiple levels, Gilmore Girls is the great American dramedy (as funky as it sounds).  Characters like Kirk are there for just laughs, but so many others in Palladino's ""little corner of the world"" are the most human I've seen on T.V.  The situations aren't about rockstars, cops or morons (hopefully no one connects with the latter).  It's about seemingly real lives and it's intellegent (perhaps the reason Lauren Graham is constantly overlooked come award time).  It's what our culture lost.

Season 5 promises to be better then the first four, because there are major character developements with Rory, the long-awaited Luke/Lorelai romance and big things for Lane's band. What I love about this season is that the writers were building up to everything from the beginning, and it finally came out.  Chilton was a stepping stone to Yale and Yale to Emily and Richard;  Rory's turn from her mother(carried into Season 6 too) has been integrated in from the off.  And all you have to do is see the pilot to know how long Luke has been ""pining"" for Lorelai.  Even with Lane's role in previous seasons, her character has been climbing the ladder to musical success, hiding CDs in the floor boards.

Spend an hour with the show and you'll see why.",1131494400,12,1360,4.798283261802575
2410564,5,B000BB1MIC,"It's very safe to say that season five of GG was a startling and smashing return to form. Coming off of the misguided season four, which started off on the wrong foot but ended with a blaze of glory, season five was the kind of season that reminded you why you loved this show, and you were just glad that it was back in glorious form. There were some things that didn't quite gel as the season progressed, but they are minor quibbles. Nothing to detract from a fine season. Why so good?. The show was back to itself. Mother and daughter were more close again, and the show just had that special GG tone back. The writing was back on firmer Gilmore ground, new storylines were fresh, brilliantly done, and for this show and characters, daring. The humor was always there, but it was better and even spicier than in season four. This is the GG I knew and love. The season premiere, ""Say Goodbye To Daisy Miller"", was a brilliant season opener, and if you know who Daisy Miller is, the title makes perfect sense. Basically, Rory slept with married Dean, and that is causing major ripples in their lives. Dean's marriage crumbles, and Rory is in this interesting new state. Meanwhile, Lorelai and Luke are an item, and the episode ""Written In The Stars"", is a magical, sweet, romantic, and sweet tour de force that has the duo going on their first date. Rory meets rich kid Logan Huntberger, and it is the beginning of a new relationship. I didn't like Logan, but events towards the end of the season changed my mind a little. Other great episodes include the series' 100th episode, ""Wedding Bell Blues"", where Richard and Emily re-tie the knot. An amazing episode that begins a strong seperation between Lorelai and Emily. The end of the season finds Rory getting a job at one of Logans' dad's newspapers. But in ""Blame Booze And Mellville"", our little Rory gets disheartening news and reacts in a shocking and un-Rory way. That's what makes it great. The finale, ""A House Is Not A Home"", is a major piece of GG television. It sets up situations that are major in these girls' lives, and carry over into season six. It rivals season four's fantastic finale in a major way. There are plenty of other good to great episodes, but too many to all name here. Not all are great, like ""I Jump, You Jump, Jack"" and ""Norman Mailer I'm Pregnant!"", which does feature the famed author, but there isn't a bad one in the bunch. The writing is top notch and back to fighting form. This was easily one of the show's best seasons ever. The storytelling was rich, and the GG heart, humor, and drama were in full force. This season was one of the most complex and the most rejuvenated. The town of Stars Hollow itself and it's number of looney, but beloved, citizens are just as much a part of the show as anyone else, and I think they got the short shrift in season four. But they are all back and more involved than last year. Lauren Graham continues to shine and is the number one actress who continues to be Emmy-worthy, but never gets the much sought after award. Not even a nomination!. Alexis Bledel as Rory continues to blossom into such a young beauty, and this season has both women in new, different, exciting, and challenging places. Season five of Gilmore Girls is great television. The girls are definitley back.",1131321600,16,3306,4.530100334448161
2410565,1,B000BB1MIC,"Season 4 of Gilmore ended on very dramatic notes: adultery, Luke and Lorelai getting together, Emily leaving Richard so as not to lose Lorelai, Digger's lawsuit which could cost Richard all his money (and thus Rory's education), and the development of secondary characters like Lane and Kirk.

Within 8 episodes of Season 5, I realized none of these plots would be resolved.  Yes, maybe one or two resolved in a superficial manner, but not in any emotional, reality-based way.

BEWARE - the rest of this post has spoilers!

You will not see any repercussions for Rory committing adultery with Dean, helping to end his marriage.  None.  Where were the incredibly gossipy townies condemning Rory as she walked hand in hand with Dean, only days after his wife publicly kicked him out of the marriage?  Nowhere to be heard.  Rory suffered no consequences, and when Dean, the ""love of her life"", left her, she shed a single tear, and one hour later was in a limo of packed rich kids, laughing drunk, and wearing $100,000 worth of jewelry.

But enough of that.  What was more atrocious was the complete ruination of Richard and Emily's characters.  They immediately team up to sabotage Luke.  Why would Emily want to hurt Lorelai (even if it's ""for her own good"") when last year she did everything possible to be back with her?  She left Richard for her!  Absolutely ridiculous.  Instead of mature scenes where Emily explains her actions and love to Lorelai, we get re-dredging of 4 years of acrimony.

So many obvious plot points,  You can see the writers thinking: how can we throw troubles into Luke and Lorelai's relationship?  I know, let's bring back Christopher!!  Obvious, dull, and ridiculous.  And we have to watch these confrontations during an inane 2nd wedding for the elder Gilmores (who cares?).  After enjoying this show for 4 years, I gave up at this point, though kept watching to see how worse it would get.

Rory devolved from an independent, intelligent, plucky girl, to a weak-willed party-girl hanging around a rich, superficial frat boy.  Oh, and we're such a quirky show, she steals a boat!

So many other things were done just for quirkiness this season, and which were patently ridiculous.  Jackson's forced vasectomy!  Ha Ha! (Why not a forced tube tying for Sookie?  Because the advertisers would have all bailed on the show).  Drunken Paris begging for money! (that was the extent of her character arc this year).  Lorelai's 15 minute pregnancy scare.

And Lorelai and Luke together?  Barely any affection shown at all - he builds her an ice skating rink (!!) and she doesn't even kiss or hug him.  Did either say ""I love you""? - I've forgotten.  Enough.  And don't expect any better for Season 6 - it degenerates further. And I once enjoyed this show.  Ughh.",1131062400,30,2783,4.811839323467231

And you allude to things/characters on the show (even though what you stated is erroneous) so you must be watching at least some episodes to form your misguided opinions. And I find that even more confusing. You post your negative opinions about a show you allegedly hate, yet you somehow watch it. Hmmmmm.

As for the rest of us who looooove the show, I think seasons 4 (even though I'm in the minority) and 5 have been the absolute best. It's faltering right now in the beginning of season 6 IMO but I will hang in there. Afte all, season 4 started out a bit odd, it finished with a bang and a kiss (the latter between L and L).

2410570,5,B000BB1MIC,"Gilmore Girls is one of those rare shows that has maintained a consistently high standard of quality throughout its run and has even managed to get better with age.  The show started with the Lorelei (Lauren Graham) & Rory (Alexis Bledel) as mother & daughter who are best friends.  Rory was an innocent intellectual who was starting a prestigious high school as sophomore.  Through the years, the show has transformed her from a young girl who lost herself in books and education to a young woman who is experiencing life first-hand.  The change started at the end of season four when Rory sleeps with her ex-boyfriend, the married Dean (Jared Padalecki) and continues in this season with her relationship with the rich Logan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry).  The change in Rory is startling and Lorelei has a tough time dealing with it thus creating rift between the two.  This season also shows the blossoming of her relationship with Luke (Scott Patterson) and how that relationship is handled by her parents Emily (Kelly Bishop) and Richard (Edward Hermann).  One particular funny episode involves Richard taking Luke golfing.  The best episodes of the season involve Richard & Emily's wedding to renew their vows and the fall-out from Emily's visit to Rory's father Christopher (David Sutcliffe) who shows up at the wedding and gets into a verbal fight with Luke.  The season ends with Rory and Logan stealing a yacht and Rory decides to drop out of Yale.  Lorelei goes to her parents for help in this matter and they agree Rory shouldn't drop out.  They provide the cruelest slap of all in Lorelei's face when they renege on their promise and Rory ends up moving into the pool house.  Ms. Graham is particular superb in this season and fact she was snubbed for an Emmy nomination is criminal.  Gilmore Girls continues to be among the best shows on television and season five only reinforces it greatness.",1129507200,151,1906,4.863777089783282

Then I began to watch the new episodes on the WB, and it happened to be during season five.  I was very entertained by the first half of the season, however I am extremely biased seeing as I am a huge Dean fan, but when Rory got involved with Logan, I think that the show took a turn.  Not for worse but, a turn in itself.  However, I really do love this season.  It is probably one of my favorites and I CAN'T WAIT to own it.  It you have the complete collection, then of course this will be a neccesity, but if you are just getting into the show, you will really enjoy this season with its various plot twists, both satisfying and sad.
