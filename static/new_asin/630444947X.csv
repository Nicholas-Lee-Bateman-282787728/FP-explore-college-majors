885025,4,630444947X,"This smart plot deals with a mistaken exchange of apartment among a free-spirited dancer in Paris ( the glamorous Juliette Binoche) and a frazzled New York psychoanalyst, starred  by this fabulous actor William Hurt. As you may guess the comic spiral of confusions, mistaken identities and a golden retriever made of this sympathetic films one of the most remarkable ones of this years.

Once more, Chantal Akerman proves us why she is still the flaming torch in this field of Belgium. Admirable direction and enjoyable performances al the way through.

A must see.",1192406400,,565,5.053763440860215
885026,4,630444947X,I love this movie! It's fun. It's pretty. It's charming. The characters are funny and lovable. The scenario is clever and engaging. The mix of French and English is enriching. It couldn't be better. Try it!,1027468800,4,206,4.75
885027,3,630444947X,"Juliette Binoche is just great as usual. THis movie is nice and relaxing, the story is nothing crazy but it is a very nice entertainment. Worth Watching.",999475200,4,153,4.703703703703703
885028,4,630444947X,"William Hurt and Juliette Binoche make a very likeable (thought unexpected) duo in this fun, escapist romantic comedy.
 The premise for the story is quite far-fetched - a New York psychiatrist (William Hurt) does an ""apartment swap"" with a Parisian dancer (Juliette Binoche.) Neither gets what they expected, and soon their paths cross in a series of quirky encouters which lead to romance.
 Both actors are very likeable in this film, with Juliette Binoche dispaying here usual ""zest for life"" style which is very endearing - quite reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn.
 The dialogue throughout the file is a mix of English and French, which gives it a very enjoyable European/continental flavour - something cosmopolitan viewers will like. It's a movie that is much more ""French"" than ""American"" in style - something you'll either love or won't, depending on your personal taste.
 If you enjoyed ""The Accidental Tourist"" or ""Forget Paris"" you will most certainly find this refreshing and relaxed romantic comedy a pleasure to watch.",970790400,11,1027,5.206060606060606
885029,4,630444947X,"What a wonderful movie experience this was.  Some say the plot is implausible.  Maybe so but this is a MOVIE...  Let go of your analytical mind and just sit back and be romanced for a change.
There are some very  funny moments as Julliette Binoche takes on William Hurts psyciatric  practice in order to make money to spend while in New York.
Get some  bon bons and a glass of your favorite wine and indulge.",956966400,4,408,4.373333333333333
885030,2,630444947X,"The premise is a little unrealistic, that a uber-psychiatrist would temporarily abandon his Manhattan practice to switch apartments for a month in Paris-a switch with an unknown woman made through the newspaper.  Incroyable!
But when you have a chance to make a film with two Academy  Award winners, Juliette Binoche and William Hurt,  set both in New York and  Paris, who would pass the chance? Chantal Ackerman could not, the  opportunity to make her first English speaking film a bonus.
The film is  a reminder of how difficult it is to cross the pond movie-wise. Nuance and  sub-text is awkward or incomprehensible here-the threads on which the movie  is woven are frassled.
This artsy little film survives entirely on  Binoche's vitality, her French innocence and enthusiasm dominates every  negative New York influence her character encounters.
It fails most  everywhere else, sadly.",949622400,2,889,5.23404255319149
7872241,4,630444947X,Love this movie and haven't been able to find it anywhere for years. Would have rented in for streaming right now when I saw it if available in that format. This movie is such a gem. Highly recommended. Never forgotten it and wish I could watch it right now.,1472256000,,258,4.285714285714286
7872242,5,630444947X,"As an aside, more than once I have gotten a Region 2 DVD because it was either much cheaper or it was the only source of the DVD I could find.  These Reg 2 DVD's will play on your PC without problem using something like VLC Media Player which is free to download. You can also convert them to AVI or MP4 format with other freebie programs like HandBrake or VidCoder. Then you can upload them to your iPad or iPhone. Although I have not done this, a friend of mine says that he converts the Region 2 DVD's to Region 1 by using Movavi DVD converter. Just saying...",1466467200,,562,4.155963302752293
7872243,5,630444947X,William Hurt definitely needs to do more comedy... this one was great!  Loved it!,1433289600,,81,4.785714285714286
7872244,1,630444947X,This film proves what a terrible director Chantel Ackerman is. She was given two great actors and a  script with some potential and this film is a major flop.itis completely with out feeling and suffers some of the worst directing i have ever seen. I am amazed that people still fawn over her status as an experimental film maker when her works are insufferably boring and of little artistic merit. if you have any doubt just watch ANY of her other films.,1427068800,,455,4.548780487804878
7872245,2,630444947X,"The film is fine--as someone else said, a good film for a glass of wine and a plate of sweets.  What's extraordinary is that it was directed by Akerman, one of the more important experimental filmmakers to come out of the global avant-garde of the 1970s and 1980s.  Criterion Collection has by now released a number of those films, like 'Chantal Akerman in the Seventies (which includes her 'New York Films').  Truly distinctive filmmaking.  Buy some of those films, too.",1401667200,,471,4.85
7872246,3,630444947X,"I was so happy to get this movie on VHS format since the dvd's are so expensive.  But I was sadly disappointed to see the movie at times was so hazy and murky you could hardly tell what the scenes were about.  It may be that the vhs version is old and is going bad, but I am not sure.  I was glad to see the movie again though.",1368403200,,327,3.710144927536232
7872247,5,630444947X,"I never saw this when it was out in theatres but it has become one of my favorites. It's a charming romance in two of my favorite cities.  Juliette Binoche is exuberant and even the usually morose William Hurt is lovable as the austere, emotionally-repressed psychiatrist.",1359590400,,272,4.913043478260869
7872248,5,630444947X,"Juliette is so sweet and sincere in her role, so adorably uncomplicated, so charmingly funny and sick of being obsessively pursued by men in this ""breath of fresh air"" romantic comedy.  John is so stuffy and full of himself as a New York Psychiatrist who is mentally run down and depressed by his patients.  They both need a break from their own lives, but where will they get it?  Only on ""A Couch in New York.""

John's bewilderment that Juliette is curing the very patients that are driving him bonkers is hysterically funny.  Juliette's genuine, caring concern for John's underlying emotional problems with his family is touching.

It's easy to love both of these character's and to wish them all the happiness their two hearts can hold.  This movie is so worth the price of admission into their private lives.  It's a lovely dream of a romantic comedy that you will want to visit over and over again.  Don't pass this one by.",1342224000,,929,4.6503067484662575
7872249,5,630444947X,"The movie has to make me feel good to part with my hard earned money.
My collection are all in the feel good variety or some really good war movies.  This movie makes me giggle.",1223510400,,177,4.057142857142857
7872250,5,630444947X,This is a charming romantic comedy with a very charismatic cast. I thought it pretty hilarious but I really want to plug the soundtrack which features the music of cellist Sonia Wieder-Atherton.  I think it is exceptional.,1219104000,,222,5.0
