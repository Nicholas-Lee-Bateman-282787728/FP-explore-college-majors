8703895,5,B00U1TFZOQ,"One of their later movies, but I think it's their best Fox feature. Stan & Ollie end up on a runaway double decker bus with no driver, wildly careening through city traffic and ending up on an amusement park roller coaster! Lots of really funny situations along the way, including an intimidating encounter with Robert Mitchum! This DVD has bonus footage of their trip to England in1932 and the most complete copy of Oliver's interview for ""Ships Reporter"" that I've ever seen. I highly recommend this DVD. It's unbelievably inexpensive and very, very entertaining.",1479340800,2,565,5.0212765957446805
