1147183,5,7894550817,"I love Columbo, and this set is both more complete than you would get even buying all the available American sets right now and incredibly densely packed- it's two DVDs per slimline case, rather than spreading four out over a digipak. It's also much cheaper than buying everything individually.

I'm annoyed that the only other review for this is based on the fact that it's region 2- I'm sure it must be annoying to be unable to watch your movies, but it doesn't reflect on the actual quality of the set, which is very high.

(I do wish I didn't have to watch the stupid ""Piracy funds terrorism"" warnings attached to every second DVD, though.)",1301443200,23,644,4.591304347826087
1147184,1,7894550817,"I see that there is now a very visible warning about the region code on this boxed set.  At the time I purchased the set, there was no obvious warning, and I had never even heard of a region code.  I now have a lovely set of dvds that will not play on my player, or anyone else's player that I know.  Why is this set even being sold in the U.S.?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Columbo-The-Complete-TV-Series-1971-2003-LAPD-416-Ultimate-English-Edition-REGION-2-PAL-DVD-Boxed-Set-35-DVDs-in-18-Slim-DVD-cases-in-a-Cigar-box-Actor-Peter-Falk-5211-minutes/dp/7894550817/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Columbo - The Complete TV Series (1971-2003) / LAPD 416 / Ultimate English Edition / REGION 2 PAL DVD Boxed Set / 35 DVDs in 18 Slim DVD cases in a Cigar box / Actor: Peter Falk / 5211 minutes</a>",1297036800,22,834,6.298245614035087
7900691,3,7894550817,"Five stars if the discs all played.
About eight times the show was ruined near the final scene by unreadable discs. Our older DVD player battled on like a trojan. The newer blu-ray player simply stopped and none of our computers (of all platforms) did any better. Of course we KNEW who dunnit but wanted to hear the final exposition.

The shows and Falk, obviously, are just pure gold.",1386806400,,385,4.579710144927536
7900692,4,7894550817,"This was for a gift and seemed well designed and providing 100s of hours of original DVD experience. The only ""problem"" is the box, which could have been a bit stronger than corrugated paper. It is designed to be a cigar box, but could have been made out of thin wood or reinforced with plastic instead. The edges of the box are easily damaged in shipping.",1367712000,,356,4.409090909090909
7900693,3,7894550817,Does this set include the NBC Mystery Movie theme song at the beginning of each episode?  It's hard finding a version of this show on DVD that includes Henry Mancini's mystery movie theme song.,1360368000,,193,4.676470588235294

got! I would have been better off spending the money

Code rating, what a bunch of bull! I just think of all
the items Ihave bought from Amazon only to have them
tell me I'm stuck with this series of unreadable disks.
Thanks Amazon looks like I'll be shopping elsewhere!!!!

7900698,5,7894550817,"All I can say is that this Complete Set of Columbo is wonderful and well worth the price, and the cost of a new DVD player that will play them. My 7 year old granddaughter and myself are making very special memories of watching Columbo together. I would tell everyone who is considering purchasing this set to do it and enjoy the hours of the of hearing THIS ONE MORE THING.",1332547200,,374,4.28169014084507
7900699,5,7894550817,"For those of you who have multiple region playing DVD players..congratulations...you know what a pleasure and savings it is to be able to view contents that other folks who have only Region 1 DVD players can't enjoy.
I had bought this entire series (Region 2 DVD's) to play on my All Region Blu-Ray player from JVC ....the discs play perfectly, amazing picture quality and sound, the folks at Playback did an awesome job with these discs.  You can't go wrong with this set....it is packaged nicely and is a savings on space and price over buying the U.S. versions of each individual season.  Yeah, they could have provided different art and pictures for each case holder instead of having the same photo on front, but on the back side it has all the info you need to see what is contained on each disc.  The small booklet that is also included is an added bonus with some fun Columbo facts.  As I was a young boy when it first aired  I never paid much attention to this series...I just wasn't into mysteries or crime dramas at the time, now that I'm older and much wiser I can appreciate the series for the fine storytelling and production values.  Unlike todays productions that rely on stunning visual effects or musical scores, this series has well written plots/scripts and excellent performances of the actors in which to carry the show.  It's easy to see why it was a popular series back then and how it's required viewing still today.",1327622400,2,1441,4.60546875
7900700,5,7894550817,"I find this vendor to be exceptional.

Not only did my order arrive 2 days early, but they were
also willing to take the merchandise back because I did not bother
to read the print that stated that the DVD's are made for a certain area.
I figured out a way to make it work for me and I will not be sending my order back.

It is extremely gratifiying to be dealing with such a company and
will certainly order from them again.",1323820800,4,425,4.0476190476190474
