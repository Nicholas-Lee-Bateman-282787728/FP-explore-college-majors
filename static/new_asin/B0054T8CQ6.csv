8457049,1,B0054T8CQ6,"If I could have given this 0 stars I would have.  This is not a workout.  It is incredibly repetitive (each movement is repeated for approx. 5 minutes).  The exercises are not exercises, they are subtle movements that are not at all aerobic or sweat inducing.  The quality of the video is horrible, low budget.  I am surprised this passed muster with Amazon as a quality product to be sold.  Yuck. A complete waste of money.",1427500800,,424,4.5131578947368425
