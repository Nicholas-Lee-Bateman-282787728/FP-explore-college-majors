8037389,3,B00062IYDW,"This dvd was started Indianapolis 500 coverage from 1965 on for 40 years. Coverage was all right but wish I had been aware of the years covered before purchase. Wanted coverage of the Novi and offie roadster period. Although am thankful the race cars of modern times are safer they just don't have "" the romance "" of earlier race cars. Never have forgotten the sound of the Novi's screaming roar and once heard will never be forgotten. Sad that both the Novis and offenhauser are gone never to return except in race fans memories. Seems now the modern race cars are more airplanes without wings than race cars.",1440028800,,610,4.605504587155964
