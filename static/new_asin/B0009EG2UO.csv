8059409,1,B0009EG2UO,"One tends to wish the best for independent filmmakers, as they must do with small budgets and other restraints, and at times they overcome all impediments with a gem being the result, but such is not the case with this dreadful work that suffers from any type of shortcoming that may be imagined, from its direction to its sound designing. The plot, if it can so be considered, begins at a pre-nuptial bachelor party that includes the obligatory strippers, one of whom is the ladylove of a sociopath who, along with two companions of the same ilk, burst into the party, bringing about a series of grotesque incidents leading to the death of the first benedict, whose bride in an unhinged state manages to steal a mannequin with precisely the same appearance as that of her murdered husband, subsequently playing house with her non-sensate surrogate. The remainder of the movie consists of frenetic and nonsensical attempts by the three hooligans to kill the young widow and her best friend (actually played with some skill by Crystal Carson), all of which is marked by woefully inadequate direction, embarrassingly silly acting, a formless scenario, and sound mixing and dubbing that rank among the worst in memory, although it is in the nature of a blessing when one cannot comprehend the dialogue; a favourite line is uttered by a villain following his suffering wounds from a number of desperate attempts by the heroine to slay him with, among other weapons, an axe and a nail gun -- ""I can't stand you"".",1140912000,,1507,4.844961240310077
