8085120,4,B000BCIOJ6,"This is a rather rare documentary concerning the infamous Claus von Bulow case, a little rough around the edges but ultimately a good source of raw trial footage.

I recently read Alan Dershowitz's well-written, behind the scenes account of the von Bulow case, titled Reversal of Fortune.  I have also seen and enjoyed the feature film of the same title based off of Dershowitz's book.  I was surprised to learn that film interviews and footage of the actual players involved in the case are rather scarce these days (it's even difficult to find photographs).  I was happy to discover this documentary for sale on Amazon (strange, it's not really mentioned anywhere else, not even on IMDB.com, practically the official database of all films).

This isn't a particularly masterful documentary, but it addresses the major points of the case and features quite a good portion of actual trial footage from the Rhode Island courtrooms.  It is also very nicely narrated by Paul Vaughan (though there are times when the court clips play without any sort of interruption for many minutes on end, so it almost feels like you're there).

If you've seen the feature film and enjoyed reading Dershowitz's book, then this will be great supplemental viewing -- to see each of the real key witnesses and lawyers on film is engaging.  The intonations and mannerisms of the people on the witness stand are fascinating elements not captured anywhere else besides the actual footage.

The film doesn't have time to touch on every intriguing aspect of the case (as Dershowitz's book is able to do) but there are aspects of the case discussed here that were not mentioned in the book (for example, did you know the jury got to visit Clarendon Court?).  The first trial in which Mr. von Bulow was found guilty are rather skimmed over; most of the time is spent with footage and discussion of the second trial, after the appeal.  You can see the jury as they are addressed by the prosecution and defense, and you can hear and see the verdict read in real time.  Interviews with Dershowitz and Mr. von Bulow, as well as footage of Sunny's children and home, and news footage from the 1980s are all included.

There's a very brief but interesting update at the end of the program which essentially mentions where all the key players are now (now being 1992 when the program was created).  There are also interesting pictures, including one brief still from a newspaper clipping which rather cryptically shows Sunny von Bulow's face many years into her final coma (I certainly hadn't seen this before).

I'd say this is a must see for anyone interested in the case.

According to the credits at the end of this program, it was written and directed by Elkan Allan and edited and produced by Stefan Sargent (Amazon incorrectly lists Sargent as the director).  It is copyrighted 1992 by Production Intelligence Ltd.  And lists ""Videotape Facilities"" as ""Spitfire Television, London.""

I assume this was aired on British and American TV in the early 90s.  I'm glad it was made available on DVD as well as Amazon On Demand (I was able to download the movie for $10 using the latter service).",1238544000,4,3160,4.805914972273568
