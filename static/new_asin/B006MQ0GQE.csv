5006133,5,B006MQ0GQE,"I purchased the DVD and the PDF Book and was very satisfied.  Both were informative.  Both were instructional but, easy to understand.  I HIGHLY recommend these.  If your thinking about building or just curious about the process THIS is what you need to see. I give them a 5 star rating.",1367712000,6,287,4.568627450980392
5006134,5,B006MQ0GQE,"First thought this was just overkill.  But, after watching realized author is a perfectionist.  I appreciated his attention to detail.  Would recommend it to someone interested in inexpensive alternative architecture and construction.",1365465600,4,234,6.25
5006135,3,B006MQ0GQE,"Well, I wouldn't pay $29.00 for it knowing how poor the quality of the video is.  I can & do accept home videos, but this DVD doesn't ever beging in any format that you would wish to view it.  Not sure why!  I have never had a dvd present itself like this!

As for the subject, I feel like there is probably enough videos on YouTube that explain things as well.

I intend to build one of these to house my tractor & lawn garden tools.  I'll build my house using SIP panels.",1364688000,,473,4.032258064516129
5006136,4,B006MQ0GQE,"I thought the video was very in formative on the basics of earth back building. It makes me want to research this technique furthur
and possibly be able to build one of my own. Defintely need a lot more info though.",1364169600,,215,4.2682926829268295
5006137,5,B006MQ0GQE,"If you are considering building an earth bag building, this DVD is one you definitely want to watch first. It has great step by step instructions. Owen is a great resource in the field and this DVD is well worth the price for the valuable information he delivers. He has the most complete guides to building an earth bag structure that I have seen so far.",1338768000,9,355,4.393939393939394
5006138,5,B006MQ0GQE,"This book has everything the beginning and intermediate earthbag builder needs, it goes over several very important steps in ensuring your build is successful. In today's world everyone thinks that because they watched a YouTube video on a family building an earthbag home that they are now earthbag building masters, this is simply not the case, Owens knowledge is from years of solid building methodology as he in collaboration with other proven innovators in natural building have laid the foundations for how we build today.

Owen Geiger, former Director of Builders Without Borders and Founder and Director of the Geiger Research Institute of Sustainable Building and the Natural Building Blog, has offered one of the best earthbag basics DVD's there is, it is clear and concise and provides exactly what is entitled, solid information without all the Hollywood effects and budget.

I solidly trust Dr. Geiger's work and teaching methods and know that my hard earned money is going to exactly what I need in information and integrity. If you are interested in earthbag homes and are taking the steps to build your own, don't be without this DVD!",1338768000,15,1150,5.079365079365079
5006139,5,B006MQ0GQE,"This is a basic earthbag building guide, which is exactly what the title says.  This is for the folks that learn visually as opposed to what they can read online.  It puts all of the information scattered across the internet and explains the simple concept in visual depth.  Dr. Owen Geiger is a great instructor and I would consider him a philanthropist for all he does on the natural building blog.  A wealth of information is shared there.
Basics are something that many people can understand when read, but until they SEE it in action, are scared to take the first step.  This video helps those souls to get out there and make a move!",1338768000,12,638,4.51304347826087
5006140,2,B006MQ0GQE,"198 minutes that could be cut short to 20 or 30 minutes tops for what it teaches! The extras are also useless, badly put together and teach nothing -- the fly through is poor in quality, and the filming/camera work that shows the final house built made me dizzy!, given the ""nervous"" camera movement... Was expecting FAR, FAR more... Most of the video shows bag after bag after bag being filled, stacked, retc... on top of it, the presentation is amateurish and the editing is SO poor that it is not worth the money; this said, given the fact there isn't much available on earthbag building, I am still keeping in on my reference shelf... but I doubt I will ever need to go back to it.",1336435200,4,685,4.4015748031496065
5006141,4,B006MQ0GQE,"This is a good basic video aimed to help beginners learn the fundamentals of preparing soil, filling bags, tying bags and stacking & tamping. The video doesn't go into much depth beyond that. I was hoping it would touch more on finishes, earthern floors, plumbing & electrical techniques but I suppose these subjects are beyond basic earthbag building. In the video Owen is creating a cool pantry to an existing structure however they never show the completed project. You do get a tour of the roundhouse though which is a definate bonus. Overall, I am happy to have this addition to my instructional video library!",1334361600,6,615,4.866666666666666
8501123,2,B006MQ0GQE,I did not buy this DVD from Amazon but directly from the company set up as his distributor. Do not waste your time with this DVD. After buying it I watched it and immediately ordered the book from Kaki Hunter. There is little chance I could build a earthbag home correctly from the information provided in this video. Only the most basic of information is included. I learned far more from people building earthbag structures on YouTube.,1507852800,,437,4.688311688311688
8501124,2,B006MQ0GQE,"The dvd was okay. After seeing the dvd found this on youtube. Not happy. Second Dr Geiger showed how to put up the walls, no problem there except he never said how you do the roof the most important part of any building. He also did not talk about plumbing, so I'll have to find another book or dvd. I feel as if I wasted my money. The only nice thing about the whole thing you really only have to buy the sandbag.",1485820800,3,414,4.0

8501127,5,B006MQ0GQE,It is a simple presentation by a very exacting teacher. He does a great job of adding to ones knowledge of the subject with some simple projects in apparently tropical climes that most of us would not be able to get away with such roofs. Glad it's in my library!,1449187200,,262,4.26

8501130,5,B006MQ0GQE,This book gave lots of information. I will be using some of the suggested techniques in the near future. Wish me luck!,1396310400,,118,4.409090909090909
8501131,5,B006MQ0GQE,This was very easy to follow.  Author takes you through the process step by step.  If you are considering an earthbag home I recommend you purchase this resource.,1391904000,6,162,4.75

the entire video is about building a pantry. the part about basic earthbag building is completely missing!",1377388800,4,126,5.35
