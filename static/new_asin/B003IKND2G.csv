8397440,5,B003IKND2G,"Love this! I play this throughout the house to unwind when I get spooled up from stress. I also tend to play this lightly in the background if I'm reading, studying, or relaxing in a hot bath.",1481932800,,192,4.216216216216216

8397443,1,B003IKND2G,"I can't beleive that people would give this a five !!!  I have over 20 garden and this is the most boring.  Some of the gardens are beautiful, however they will pick one flower or some other item and leave the camera on each for as long as five minutes.  It is one step up from a slide show!  As far as the music goes I had to mute it as it was more boring than the video.  Not even a choice of just nature sounds ! ! !  Save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!",1333929600,3,448,3.8152173913043477
8397444,5,B003IKND2G,"After purchasing and viewing all the Zen Garden series of DVD's I have to say this is my favorite!  Don't get me wrong all the other DVD's are just as good, but I enjoyed this one the most.  I always loved and still look forward to watching the cherry blossoms bloom in the Spring season.  Here not only are they in bloom, but the music that complements this DVD also adds to the experience.  Even when listening to just the nature option on this DVD the sounds of the chimes and birds help put my mind at ease.  I would highly recommend this DVD.  ^_^  If you enjoy watching the cherry blossoms another DVD I would recommend is from SynForest.",1317600000,3,644,4.316666666666666
8397445,5,B003IKND2G,"I love all these relaxation videos by Zenchantent. In fact, I can't wait for more to come out. I use these beautifully produced videos to relax, to just have on as background or to enjoy as a sort of visual painting with music. I even use these to go to sleep if I'm restless or I want to replace traffic noise with my own serene environment. This cherry blossom one is one of my favorites, especially since I've spent time in Japan and love Japanese gardens. I never grow tired of this; it keeps growing on me.",1316304000,4,511,4.278350515463917
8397446,5,B003IKND2G,"This is one of my favorites in my collection of ambient and relaxation videos.  I love everything about it, but mostly the way it makes me feel. Every time I put this on, all the worries of my day, the traffic noise, everything just goes away. The cinematography in HD format, the music and everything is just so perfect. Whenever I want to unwind I play this. Sometimes I even go to sleep with it looping all night. It acts like white noise to drown out the traffic and it fills my bedroom with lush, serene colors and sounds that make me feel very much at peace with the world. I have all the other videos from Zenchantment too. I can't wait for more to come out. I'll keep buying them all.",1316304000,3,692,4.242424242424242
8397447,5,B003IKND2G,"I've been over to Japan a couple of times and this DVD really reminds me of springtime when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. In Japan the cherry blossoms have a very special meaning and this DVD captures it well. The camerawork is beautifully framed as it slowly goes from cherry blossoms to the zen garden scenery, the colors are vibrant and inviting. And I like the music- very understated, but not like one of those annoying new-agey piano saccharine soundtracks. Instead, the music is very cool, hip and hypnotic. And I like how the DVD loops automatically. It's the perfect relaxation dvd whenever I do yoga. I've recommended it to my friends and they love it.",1274572800,11,671,4.694915254237288
