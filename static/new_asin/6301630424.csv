7813939,5,6301630424,"Rock & Read is filled with fun for the little ones. The 80's rock 'n' roll music video style is a colorful treat for the eyes and ears of a new generation.  The songs include: ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star;"" ""I'm a Little Teapot;"" ""The Alphabet Song;"" ""Eensy Weensy Spider;"" and ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat.""  With Pauly Shore leading them, our little kids are learning to read the words so fast. Pauly is giving unconditional love as he teaches the familiar children's classics, revived by popular 80's bands like the Bangles and DeLaSoul. We are tapping our toes, too, as we remember the good old days.  We just bought a bunch of DVDs to use as baby gifts.  It's never too young to get smart.",1338076800,,691,4.504

Pauly Shore is engaging and the kids show that standard children songs can be updated and 'hip'.  It's ROCK and Read and that is what they do.",1177804800,,328,4.09375
7813942,5,6301630424,"1. This video features Pauly Shore who later stars in ""In the Army Now"" and ""Encino Man"". 2. Susanna Hoffs sings ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" on here, and she sings it very sweetly. 3. If you like Hip-Hop,(even old school) Give De La Soul's Version of ""I'm a Little Teapot"" a go(WHAT DOES MARTIANS HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?!)4. A silly sounding rendition of the ABC Song that may not be suitable for parents who have no sense of humor. 5. The guys that wrote ""Like A Virgin"" and other hits, Their arrangement of ""Eensy Weensy Spider"" is heard here and sung by one of the guys, Tom Kelly. 6. Another Bangle Featured on this Video!! Listen for Vicki Peterson singing ""Row,Row,Row You Boat"" with Bobby Donanti, This Version Rocks HARD!!! 7. This video is Directed By Susanna's mother Tamar Simon Hoffs. Hope this Review Helps!!!",1016150400,,824,4.6506849315068495
