1713745,3,B000066C77,"""Final"" was intriguing enough to keep me interested the entire time.  I wanted to give it like 3 and a half stars because it's not quite a 4 star movie, but better than a 3 star movie.  There is a great twist in the film (which I love) but the very end was a bit predictable.  However, it didn't ruin the movie for me.  I'm not sure I would classify this as sci-fi.  It's more of a mystery/semi-thriller.  It reminded me of the old Twilight Zones a little or The Outer Limits tv show a lot.  If you are looking for spaceships, robots, high tech machines ... this movie doesn't have any of that.  But it does have some pretty good acting, an interesting plot and a winding story line that will keep you guessing til the very end.  There are a lot of bad movies out there today... I wouldn't consider this one of them.",1091923200,18,816,4.17948717948718
1713746,2,B000066C77,"Dennis Leary is known for his high-speed humorous rants.  I was hoping for THAT Dennis Leary.
Science Fiction is known for special effects.  Effects... SOME kinda effects.
Neither was in this film.
Oh, sure, Dennis Leary proved he could do a 90 minute soliloquoy (Did I spell that right ? *grin*) with fair impact.  Kudos, Dennis.
Beyond that, though, I can't see what others are raving about.  The plot-twist was unexpected, but I kept waiting for things that didn't come:  more evidence of chemistry between the doctor and Dennis, and SOME evidence of special effects.
If you buy this DVD, be prepared for what it delivers:  Good acting by one guy and his lesser-light costar, and a good plot twist at the end.
Other elements you'd expect-- action, high humor, high tension, SF effects, technology of the future-- are not evident.  This is a no-action drama with a plot twist.",1085616000,3,878,4.8133333333333335
1713747,5,B000066C77,"Actually this was well acted all around. But Dennis really proved himself here.
Better then his role in Lake Boat and I really liked that. I have both these films in my library now.
A word of caution to most of you. There is no action in this film. 80% of the film takes place in one room. But having said that, this is a really good film. That has a well written, interesting story, that is enhanced by the performances of the two leads.
The story revolves around Dennis's character who wakes up in very sterile hospital setting, not knowing why he is there, why he can't leave, where he is in time, and is his life really at risk.
Thanks Dennis another good film. For me I take your name in the cast as an indicator that I need to see the film.",1082851200,11,746,4.151724137931034
1713748,5,B000066C77,"It is low budget, and borderline ""sci-fi"". BUT, it's also got an incredible story, excellent acting and intangible qualities that may make you want to cry in the end. With that said, it's not a chick-flick either (it's just that, I think I'm in love with Hope Davis after seeing this). And Leary totally saved the movie from obscurity for me. He is cast perfectly for this role. I won't tell any details, the less you know the better. Not for everyone, but if you like drama, sci-fi, and don't mind a bit of a slow start, you'll be glad you saw this movie. I can't wait to watch it again.",1035504000,20,588,4.306306306306307
1713749,5,B000066C77,"Leary's, Davis's and Scott's best work, bar none.  The screenwriter, Bruce McIntosh, also did a brilliant job.  I've seen Leary miscast in so many films that it was wonderful finally seeing him in one that showed all facets of his talent.  He should not be in light, frothy romantic comedies, which he's done, and this certainly is not a light, frothy, romantic comedy. I'm not even sure he should be in gangster films and I've seen him in several of those (ok at best).  He and Hope Davis are great together here and come together better as a couple than he has come together with any other actress in a film. I've seen him in romance vehicles with other actresses, like Sandra Bullock, that were just dismal.  He needs to do biting satire like he did in ""The Ref"" or outright layered, nuanced drama, like he does here. (I also loved his standup comedy act.)

Leary's character, Bill, wakes up from a coma in a psychiatric hospital with delusions that he is about to be executed by some futuristic society which has unfrozen him from the past.  However, under Hope Davis's care as Ann, his psychiatrist, he starts remembering trauma from his pre-coma life, including the death of his father, a break up with his fiance, and a drunken binge while driving. He starts to recover from his mental breakdown yet his delusions don't entirely disappear, surprisingly enough.  Or are they delusions?  Great blues music throughout.  I'd heard nothing about this film and tried it out simply based on what I read on the box and Leary's, Scott's and Davis's involvement.  I wasn't expecting a perfect 10 of a film but I sure got it!  Hubby absolutely loved it too.

1713751,5,B000066C77,"I found this movie by accident a few years ago because Denis Leary is the lead actor. This is some of Leary's best work. I like anything he does. And also I really like Hope Davis. She is wonderful in this. This is a big low-budget sleeper. Too bad it didn't get more media attention from the Hollywood elite idiots who brainwash the public with the mass-marketing trash they regurgitate over and over. This story is very unique and interesting with great characters and a great plot. You really can't figure out where it's going until the very end,but it keeps you entwined in the storyline and wanting to know more all the way through. Really keeps you guessing. This is definitely a cerebral film that makes you think. It has become one of my favorite films of all time. I rewatch it every couple of years like tonight.",1416700800,,822,4.523489932885906

1713753,5,B000066C77,"I purchased this film for very little $. I tried to watch this film a dozen times and after 20 minutes I was bored. This has been going on since 2007. Last week I viewed Dennis & Hope in ""The Secret Lives of Dentists"" & though I must not be patient enough to enjoy a possibly unique film and that was exactly the problem. As I watched the film I noticed that I was being enveloped by the plot. There were not the traditional protagonist and antagonist but a incredible love story with superb dialog and acting. The film kept getting better as I watched it and I was floored. Sure there were minute pieces that could have been tweaked. One hallway shot after the deaths & Dennis could have taken a few guitar lessons a la Ralph Macchio Crossroads But aside from being pedantic I love this film and it just reaffirms a philosophy that I try to incorporate into my life-Have patience with art, especially film with actors that love. The most important analogy especially for this film is captured in a performance from a musical perspective. Would you rather hear a band start off a tune with explosive energy and see them slowly fall apart that by the end the crowd is disgusted or a a band start a tune sloppy and disjointed but slowly work to get the timing, energy and cohesiveness that ends in a triumphant climax? I would take the latter and that is how I assess this film.",1383004800,2,1376,4.4
1713754,3,B000066C77,"Cheap production,weird story, good atmosphere and two competent actorsin a film wich should last no more than 70 minutes. A man who wakes up in a strange place not knowingwho and where he is surely is a cliche, but here the cliche  becomes intriguing. The movie has three distinct parts. the first one,when the viewer, probably a sci-fi fan like me, thinks he has just made a mistake watching it, because really it does not look a scifi movie. The second part, where the viewer gets caught in a mysterious situation(is the guy really in the future?Is this really a worls devastated by a plague?Are the guys in the hospitalsome kind of survivors?)and knows this IS a good scifi plot. The third partwith the surreal ending confuses the viewer...is it or is not a scifi movie? Watch it and decide...It should have been made in black and white, in less than 70 minutes. It would be a  very good episode of the original The outer limits...",1256774400,,934,4.620481927710843
1713755,4,B000066C77,"After discovering Denis Leary's awesome acting in Rescue Me, i decided i should try and find a few more.

I was pleasantly surprised with Final. Where other films have been completely panned, this one, thought the same might be critically said, i thought this film was quite interesting.

Though it can be confusing in places, there are some great moments in the movie. Denis Leary is quite good in this movie, i would say that it is one of my favorites. A highly underrated actor, Leary pulls off the frustration that would come with people told that the world as he knows it, no longer exists.

A slow moving film, but quite engaging.",1251676800,3,636,4.610619469026549
1713756,3,B000066C77,"Maybe I was mislead by some of the raving reviews here, but after watching the movie I was somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I don't need the typical Hollywood ""FX loaded but no story"" kind of movies to feel entertained. But this one was a bit too minimal or ""independent"" for me. Especially, since I didn't expect that after reading the amazon description and the reviews for the movie.

Since the whole movie just took place in maybe four or five different locations (in the same building), it reminded me more of a theater play than a movie. Which isn't bad per se, but again not what I expected when reading something about a ""great SciFi movie"".

Last but not least I found the ending kind of disappointing. Although Denis Leary had his hero moment, to me it was left too unclear, if his sacrifice had lead to a success for human mankind or not. The sister of his doctor had died, before they could help her. Ok, bad for the doctor, but what did that mean exactly for the rest of the world??? No help for nobody? Or just bad luck for the doctor?

Anyhow, if you don't hang your expectations too high, are a big fan of Denis Leary or like the minimal SciFi approach, you might have a nice time watching this movie.",1251072000,,1227,4.39647577092511
1713757,3,B000066C77,"Coincidentally, I watched Resolution #9 a few days prior to watching this one. That movie showed a man descending into paranoia-- believing everyone is out to get him and conspiring against him for some type of experiment. This one also has a hero in a similar situation. However, here, there is doubt as to whom to believe.

Denis Leary is great in this role and the movie is interesting, although it's not a perfect film by any means.

He wakes up one morning in a mental hospital believing it is 400 years in the future. He believes he went into the hospital to do a cryogenic experiment on his finger 400 years ago and that he was put into a cryogenic sleep against his will. He believes that he overhears the hospital staff talking about giving him his ""final"" injection that will kill him.

He tries to enlist the aid of his doctor (played without emotion by Hope Davis) who he begins to trust. As he begins to trust her, he starts doubting his own beliefs.

This movie has a great premise and almost delivers in its execution. Actually, it does, but it's not too satisfying. It's a good movie, but could have been a bit better had Hope Davis' character been a bit more emotional. The movie would have been better served had her character just been a bit less flat.

Recommended with some reservations. If you like the genre, you'll like the movie.",1202083200,,1354,4.510204081632653
1713758,3,B000066C77,"This film has an interesting premise that doesn't quite live up to its potential.  Leary's character, Bill Tyler, is confined in a psychiatric hospital, where he is being evaluated by Dr. Ann Johnson (Hope Davis).  Most of the film involves Ann's sessions with Bill, where his claims of being cryogenically frozen for 400 years are interspersed with memories of his past.  It all moves along pretty slowly at first, and can be a little confusing, leaving you wondering where it is ultimately headed.  Eventually, the truth about Bill is revealed fairly quickly.

The end of the film is somewhat unsatisfying and leaves a lot of questions unresolved.  Unfortunately, the DVD lacks any special features, such as commentary, that may lend insight into some of these unanswered questions.  Overall, it is not a bad film, and in hindsight will probably be more enjoyable the second or third time around.",1153872000,,898,5.027027027027027
1713759,4,B000066C77,"What at first looks to be a relatively standard drama of a patient in a mental institution turns out to be something far removed from that in this intriguing science fiction film.  And make no mistake, this IS science fiction.  Once the basic premise is revealed, it is crystal clear that what is really going on here challenges the main character and the viewer as well in their moral priorities.

The main character, Tyler, is played by Dennis Leary, who turns in a solid performance as someone whose paranoid fantasies of his current situation, ostensibly in said mental institution, fuse with his memories of a lost love from years before.  His doctor is Hope Davis, here proving her versatility as, at first, a removed scientist, then gradually warming to her subject.

The doctor's sister is also a patient, but one confined because of a physical illness, not for reasons of mental deterioration. This is a key element in the puzzle of this film as it unravels, as is the ice-cold director of the institution and the complete geographical isolation of the institution itself.

As Tyler's memories become clearer, he simultaneously moves closer to the doctor emotionally.  This very intelligent plot device is critical in the development of the story.  The beginning is a bit slow, because of what, as mentioned, appears to be a fairly routine scenario.  But stick around; it gets MUCH better.

A really well thought out script and fine acting make this a highly recommended, literate, science fiction film.",1094256000,22,1512,4.964285714285714
7962444,5,B000066C77,"It's based on a play and it reads like a play. If you are looking for High budget Hollywood Frills, this is not for you, but it's  so good!

7962448,1,B000066C77,"waiting, waiting, what happened? What happened to the plot? This movie cannot be considered even a ""filter"" since it does nothing to satisfy your entertainment needs.  I would not recommend watching it for free. No enjoyment here.",1439856000,,230,5.216216216216216

But is he fooling her? How did he end up where he is?

No spaceship, robots or thing that blow up in this clever sci-fi tale. Perhaps a bit slow at times for a supercharged audience with soundbyte mentality, but it is an independent film with no pressures from ""above"" to toss in nudity or gore.  Wait for the full film to finish before drawing your own conclusions. Primary actors were very compelling, even the security guy who was never allowed to speak!",1436832000,2,721,4.530769230769231
7962451,4,B000066C77,"I'm probably going to regret it later giving Final 4 stars, but it's actually an okay movie.  The problem is that it has way too many unproductive points.  It's about a mental patient who wakes up into the future (or past- LOTS of confusion figuring out which one's which!) and finds himself communicating with a psychiatrist (played by the familiar Hope Davis- familiar because I went to school with a girl who resembles her appearance in this movie almost exactly, hehe).  He doesn't understand why he's there, and the information we gather in the beginning doesn't really reveal much either.

I'll just speak for myself- I wasn't sure what was going on for the longest time hence the confusion.  I figured given how intelligent, alert and responsive Denis' character is whenever a question' asked (even though some online reviews that I've read say he wasn't alert- I don't understand that because he was clearly alert and even talkative and normal-speaking from my perspective) that there must be some kind of mistake and he doesn't *really* have any mental issues.  Well without spoiling the exact reason for his admittance because doing so would probably be a huge spoiler, let's just say it turns out he's 30 years into the future or past without knowing anything about it.  The reason leans on science fiction perhaps because of a worldwide epidemic problem going on, but then again who's to say such a situation isn't likely to actually occur some day?  To freeze someone and... nevermind.

The reason Final is only above average is because it tends to drag for long periods at a time.  Denis Leary is a terrific actor of course and it turns out he's an accomplished blues guitarist which is interesting timing given today's surprising news of the passing of BB King.  On a side note I had to laugh while Hope stood by and seemingly enjoyed the guitar playing she was experiencing.  Problem is, yeah, she doesn't exactly seem like the guitar lover type given her quiet personality!  Well for 80% of the movie, Denis and Hope discuss Denis's situation.  By the end I was thinking to myself much of the storytelling prior wasn't even important or necessary based on the events of the final 20 minutes, but I guess it's done this way to show what it's like for a normal psychiatrist to calmly and rationally ask questions to a patient, so we're led to believe he really needs help.  I wish the questions being asked were more exciting- so much of this story drags.  The stuff with Denis' girlfriend was underutilized and could've been given more time, along with the segments with the people we see in beds (such as Hope's sister and the older guy).

It would've also helped to venture out more.  That's pretty much the nature of the beast there however, because there's not a whole lot you can do when it comes to a mental institution.  You can travel to the TV room with the other sick folks, you can walk up and down hallways, you can go for short walks outside, but for the most part the story is confined to Denis' room.  Makes it sort of depressing and dreary but again, it HAS to be that way to capture the accuracy of a mental institution.  You can't exactly show the patients attending a carnival downtown without it feeling completely awkward.  It's also worth pointing out the tone of this movie is never really tense or angry.  It's calm and almost welcoming.  Denis perhaps should've expressed angrier emotions from time to time, specifically that of feeling trapped or incredibly bored/frustrated.

Overall, well a more interesting story would've helped me to give Final an even higher rating.  Too much uninteresting downtime between Hope and Denis' character made me occasionally wonder if it was worth sticking with the film until its conclusion.  Overall decent, and a fantastic final 20 minutes, but the stuff leading up to the ending was mostly filler.",1431648000,,3878,4.775112443778111
