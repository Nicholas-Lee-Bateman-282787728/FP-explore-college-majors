If you don't take my recommendation to heart and rent this movie, you'll know within the first 30 seconds that you've made the wrong choice.  Please take my advice.....this movie bites the big one, it sucks.",1379203200,3,321,4.578947368421052
8603695,1,B00EC6VZOS,Just...bad. Not bad enought to be campy fun (though I suspect they may have been aiming for that). I actually fell asleep.,1512864000,,122,4.590909090909091

It could have been a fun campy movie. Its not funny, its not scary, its just a story.  It suffers from common and uncommon errors.  If the camera work was much better and they replaced the thespians with more normal actors, it might be a fun B movie.  Sound seems good/natural for the locations. Camera work is not really good and too close and off sided for people.  If the camera person could pull back a bit for the love of god. I wonder if the camera man has a skin fetish or maybe wants to be a dermatologist. Was this shot by Len Kabasinski?  If so, I am now waiting for 25 Dutch angles.  Some of the music added in post seems off  and odd for the moment or transition.  The film was edited  well.

I gave nicknames to characters and put them in brackets

I really think this is based off a script, but more specifically it was written as a play, it really feels like it.  Some of the actors over act and think the Broadway play needs accents.  Both items hurt the film a lot. The woman playing the older actress and Brimstone both are with out a doubt stage actors and its painfully obvious.  Their style does not transfer to this medium.  It does NOT feel like they are doing a tongue and cheek movie like Larry Blamire does with ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"".

- Male lead (Amish boy):  Seems to be going for a bit too over the top and intense, while trying to summon the face of Jack Nicholson.  You will see it when he is on screen, its actually bad funny for a second and gets old fast.  He seems always way to excited to be on camera and talking, not a good thing.
- The sound girl (I call her, Juno):  Is quite good, natural in line delivery and you actually believe her doubt and sarcasm in the opening house scene calls for.  Is quite good thru the movie and enjoyed her in this.
- Psychic (Psychic): Not bad, read lines well enough for any B movie. She is quite good at some points and just ""fine"" at others.
- Actress (Eye Tweezer):  Over acting and it hurts the movie.  This is not a play.  She reads lines like its a play and there is an audience, those dramatic pauses.... man oh man.
- The caretaker (Useless man): Completely unnecessary.  Horrible acting and accent, again one who thinks its some dramatic theater production.  Was he reading his lines off set in the doorway?
- Brimstone (Not Sherlock Holmes):  Over acting and it hurts the movie.  This man is delusional, bad and thinks he is Sherlock Holmes in front of an audience.

I have no clue why they attempt the re budding relationship of Eye Tweezer and Not Sherlock Holmes as a 5 minute scene in the movie.  Maybe  filler, flavor, emotion, a personal moment.....well who the poop cares.... its a scary horror movie and not a Broadway play.

I have no clue why they do not use the lights that look like candles and instead they restore power.  We have lights... I suggest we use hot pink and green flood lights, it is the only and best way to shoot this.  They should have used a candle look made the scenes lighter, but it can add more shadows.  The lighting effects do not put the actors skin in the best light, so to speak.  This lighting choice turns out to be one of the worst parts of the movie for me. The light colors and intensity pull you out of any moment you are watching and reminds you its a bad movie.

The only two good characters are Juno and the Psychic.  The movie works when they are on screen and It works because they are being themselves and not trying to act like an actor.

It is not as bad as people say, unless they have not seen truly bad movies.",1509840000,2,3575,4.246290801186944
8603697,1,B00EC6VZOS,"Nope nope nope.  This is just silly.  Bad acting and the main character, for some unknown reason, keeps his head tipped forward and looks at everyone from the tops of his eyes.  Don't waste your time.",1508371200,,200,4.5

8603699,2,B00EC6VZOS,"The only thing redeeming about this video is that the main guy VAGUELY resembles Theon Greyjoy.  Bearing that in mind, even my obsession with Game of Thrones was not enough to carry me any further than 25 minutes 37 seconds.  ...I was cleaning up while watching this, it didn't even have my full attention - I just couldn't take it anymore.  The acting is cringey (especially the has-been actor and the caretaker), and the audio is irritatingly tinny.  Skip it.",1507766400,,461,4.725
8603700,1,B00EC6VZOS,"I wouldn't call this a horror movie. More like a ghost therapy session. There was nothing scary about it. The acting was poor, lighting was bad, the plot was nonexistent. Don't waste your time.",1507507200,,193,4.705882352941177
8603701,3,B00EC6VZOS,"Barry Bird (Christian Pawlowski) who lives in his mom's basement, is having a podcast on the 25th reunion of ""The House Where Evil was Born."" He has with him his technician Raike (Jennifer Verardi); the state's best psychic Amber (Jenny Costanzo); Victor Brimstone (Anthony D.P. Mann) the star of the feature; and scream queen former playmate co-star Vera Sunset (Sherri Paterson).

Barry conducts the interviews while Amber promises a seance as she feels a presence.

First off the title of the film I watched was ""The Ghostkeepers"" as opposed to ""Ghostkeepers."" The word ""THE"" appears inside the ""O"" in the word Ghost. I see DVD covers with and without ""the.""  This was a low budget film and suffered from the aspects of low budget. The sound quality had an echo. The acting was more fit for the stage than film. The voice enhancer for ghost speak was groan worthy. The plot had too many slow spots to build character and plot. And DP Mann must be some kind of gag porn name. And the ending was simply bad.

On the plus side, the script had some aspect of originality, even though the execution left much to be desired. The acting wasn't as bad most low budget films, except for Jennifer Verardi who seemed to be a first year drama student. Certainly the film view of Vera Sunset was great, a woman who reminded me of a blond Jamie Lee Curtis.

There was something about the film that I liked in spite of it being so bad. It was an honest effort that showed promise.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Very soft 3 stars.",1440374400,,1521,4.532846715328467
8603702,2,B00EC6VZOS,"Ghostkeepers story is a typical draw which hopes to bring the paranormal into the new age of fandom- the podcast and fandom blog world. The movie does a decent enough job to set up the story and give the characters enough to build from, however the attempt seems to fall a bit flat with this film. The acting is amateurish to the level of uncomfortable to watch. There is one actress who really stands out as a pretty believable talent-  Jennifer Verardi. Beyond her character the majority of this films human aspect seems less than.

The acting and melodrama seems to hint to some major chilling aspects of this ghost story but those moments seemed to vanish on screen and the drama just falls dead on the breath of the actors. The spooky thrills that should make any and all paranormal or horror films is almost non-existent in this pic so that was a bit disappointing. I found myself rewinding the disc thinking I missed the action, but that was just wishful thinking-there was almost no real action or chills to be had with Ghostkeepers. I was not happy with the film and it held little entertainment value for me personally.",1432512000,,1129,4.611940298507463

So,Depending on which generation we touch,Imagine Jonathan Frid (From classic Dark Shadows) being summoned back to Collingswood Manor or Jonathan Rhys Meyers having to tour the TUDORS castle,YIKES !
This haunted ghost story recreates for a podcast the film `The House Where Evil Was Born' stars reunited in a seance for there director ,who may have had help offing himself as film wrapped.
There is romance,intrigue and some actually good acting and scares happening here.",1381708800,4,497,5.225
