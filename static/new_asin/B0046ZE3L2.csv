8417521,4,B0046ZE3L2,"I love Christi Taylor's routines. This is one of my favorites. It took several times to get the moves but, with the help of her Move Master section, it was quite doable. I also enjoy most of the add-on work-out routines. The only negative is the cool down. It could be more interesting.
I haven't done the floor routine, yet, because I'm more of a step aerobics person, but I would highly recommend this workout.",1323388800,,412,4.506666666666667
