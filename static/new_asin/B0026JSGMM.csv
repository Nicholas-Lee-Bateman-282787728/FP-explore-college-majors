8352868,5,B0026JSGMM,"As one commenter stated, the picture quality is a little rough and some of the actual mound footage appears to be somewhat dated but it's worth the trade off to see some of the old black and white stuff. I loved it! The Edgar Cayce mound connection is new territory for me.  I decided to rent this film after recently reading a book called ""Path of Souls"" which is also written by Dr. Greg Little, the the director / narrator of this documentary. This Video seems to be more of an introduction to Little's research about Cayce and the mound builders. I would highly recommend checking out the book ""Path of Souls"" for a more in depth look at the subject matter in this film as well as detailed descriptions of the artifacts and accounts of the early explorers. Some how Greg Little takes this wild hot button alternative subject matter and turns it into a rational conversation. Five stars",1424736000,,889,4.55625

8352870,2,B0026JSGMM,"I found the content interesting and even thought provoking, but the picture quality was poor. I found it better to watch on a small screen than a big one because the picture quality was annoying on my 50"" TV.

On the content itself, it would have been nice to learn more about the artifacts excavated from the mounds. Although examples are shown, there was no explanation or even speculation offered as to how old they were, what their purpose was, or even what they were thought to represent. Some of the artifacts shown were quite impressive, but it would have been nice to know if they were imported from elsewhere, or made locally; whether they show regional stylistic differences or share characteristics common across the mound sites. These artifacts, which could shed light so much light on the culture, were just glossed over.

My overall impression was that the presenter was only interested in corroborating Edgar Cayce's claims, rather than presenting a factual account of what is actually known about the mounds and their builders. No citations for any of the ""scientific evidence"" presented are given, particularly in respect of the DNA evidence discussed. Mention is made of controversy surrounding this evidence in the archeological community, but we're not told why the findings are controversial. This doesn't actually strengthen the case being made in my opinion. In fact, it has the opposite effect. I'm going to have to research the matter myself now before I decide whether to believe any of it or not.",1312329600,7,1523,4.9921259842519685
