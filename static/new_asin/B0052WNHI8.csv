8454616,3,B0052WNHI8,"Thank God at least they did not take themselves too seriously at least! Some people (like the detrimental Asylum, do!).No, this knows to be a light farce with tongue in cheek horrific moments! but
The predictable story would run amok pretty quickly, despite the great environmental subtext, and its family's film under tones, since the writing seems poor and the directing is rarely inspired or even just above B level, without much of a visual style, or believable special effects(the really weakest part!). However, there was thankfully some cleverness to make this effort worth watching: the idea to push over the top with an often hilarious light tone, that never lets you take anything too seriously, helps a huge deal, making up for lack of tension or cohesive story telling! Actually this at times almost juvenile tone makes the movie unexpectedly growing on you, to a somewhat quirky 'simpatico', allowing the good cast to convey some weight to their characters! In fact we always find ourselves following them with curiosity and sympathy.
Again, while cinematography, production and costume design, score are just passable, despite the beautiful Central/Northern California's rural and bucolic locations work, tremendously accentuating the ecological prime interest of the movie, the script and direction are too weak to make up for a solid attempt at the genre, here, and both feel almost undecided whether going directly for exploitative choices or more personal and witty ones. Always almost about to fall apart, the film is mainly hold together tightly by the good intentions and the cast. On this particular department, a mention must go to new actor Pete Punito, whose portrayal of the troubled lead character, professor Gino Coletti, adds up with solid work, and, an almost defining wit and vitality. There's also a supporting role played by Domiziano Arcangeli (by far the only recognizable name by far, of the whole exceptionally supporting, and supportive talent, here so well cast as an ensemble, and, at least for the lovers of Cult films!) who's almost the villain of the movie: a well appointed suburban douche bag, one of those self proclaimed life coaches, but truly just a drunk, provincial, D grade playboy, made by the talented actor really memorable and vigorously impressive, and, thankfully, will go back on him through the use of a suggestive flashback that finally deepens into the premise, bringing more reason to the plot as well, and, certainly benefiting of Arcangeli's ex pretty boy charisma, the actor seems to demolish with a clever gusto!
Over all, it may not be certainly the best, but never the worst, if you don't have major expectations you may get a kick out of it!",1390608000,,2711,5.09438202247191
8454617,2,B0052WNHI8,"I decided to give this movie a look based on review that gave this a three or better. Two is being overly generous, poor production values, a weak cast and laughable special effects. I found this movie by going through the entire Amazon Prime horror movie catalog looking for movies that might be worth a look. In all fairness this one was way down the movie list and I selected it in spite of my better judgement. Do yourself a favor and learn from my experience, give this one a pass!",1372982400,,486,4.351648351648351
8454618,4,B0052WNHI8,"I enjoyed watching it. It has the romantic interest, the mystery, the action, the violence, the sci-fi/DNA aspect, and the special effects. This should be a model for any low-budget sci-fi film.",1372204800,,194,5.09375
8454619,5,B0052WNHI8,"I  LAUGHED OUT LOUD!, (sic, mine) I had the scene as the fertility doctor. It was a blast, and the movie is really hilarious. Genetic scientist using a Gilbert chemistry lab microscope!?! It could save millions of dollars in genetic research! Buy the movie, Buy two and give one to friends. It's an enjoyable feature film!!!",1316995200,,324,4.785714285714286
8454620,3,B0052WNHI8,"""Lizard Boy"" is Director, Paul Della Pelle's debut feature film, he also co-wrote the script with Bruce Brown. The film is an action/comedy/horror that also takes aim at science and asks the question, how far is too far when it comes to cloning and other genetic experiments. We get to meet the doctor's reptile son who they named Carlo early in the film then by using flashbacks along with present day we are brought up to speed on how exactly this Carlo was create, as time goes on and as Carlo begins to kill more people police and those in charge of the lab begin to take notice which leads to action packed, ultimate showdown at the end, the film tosses in a few nice twists as well. The use of flashbacks in the film work well with the present day happenings and it never takes any of the momentum away from the film, the pace is steady which never allows the audience to become bored of the story.

The film never takes itself serious, sure there's plenty of action and even some gore but the film is a comedy at heart. I found the film to be very funny at times and thought it was an original take on the genre. The whole idea of the lizard boy sets up some hilarious situations. If you go into the film with an open mind then I think you will have as much fun as I did watching it. The cast did a terrific job, each and everyone in the film looked like they had a fun time making it and it translates back to the audience. ""Lizard Boy"" may not be for everyone but Indie fans who are always looking for something a bit different to watch should eat this up. I don't know about anyone else but a lizard boy doing martial arts and some wire-fu gets high marks from me. I had an enjoyable time with this one and look forward to what this promising new director has up his sleeve next.
