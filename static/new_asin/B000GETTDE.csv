8679012,1,B000GETTDE,"This is worth about $1.  The info on this is completely misleading.  There are no worthwhile performances on this disc.  The way it works is the band will be performing, but after about 2 minutes, it will cut to the group being interviewed(in the most banal possible fashion - eg ""How long have you been into music?"", ""Do you like being on the road?"", etc. arrggg) by some incredibly stupid female host.  Then it cuts back to the live performance for anther minute or two, and then back to dumb, boring interview from hell.  Then it's on to the next band.  There is about 30 minutes of content total on this DVD.

I am an ISIS fan and bought this thinking I was getting a live performance shot in High Definition.  What I got was aproximately 4 - 5 minutes of music interspersed with an equal amount of unbelievably bad interview.  Let me repeat 4 - 5 MINUTES OF MUSIC PER BAND.  A typical ISIS song is 7 - 9 minutes long.  And that 4 - 5 minutes is spread across 2 SONGS.  Thanks so much for 2 whole minutes of each song.<sarcasm>

The video and sound quality is excellent, and comparable to the original HD broadcast.  Too bad the content is so unbelievably thin.  This disc is just barely worthy of being freely given away with a magazine.  Do not buy this under any circumstances.",1154563200,2,1284,4.377118644067797
