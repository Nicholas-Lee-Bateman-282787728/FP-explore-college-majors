8073077,1,B000A2X93S,"This is the last time Ans Records gets money from me.
I think they bought the cheapest copy they could find of this film, put it on a DVD and took some images and processed them in Photoshop to put on the cover. To look good.
What I bought is a collection of scratches and film imperfections of all kind. The quality of the copy I bought is so bad it is painful to watch.
I give 1 star to Carlos Gardel and his songs.
What a disservice to the Argentinian music and movies.",1226880000,,472,4.031914893617022
8073078,5,B000A2X93S,"Can you blame me for being in love with one of the most talented and popular Argentinean vocalists of all time?  For those of you unfamiliar with Gardel, this film is a grand introduction.  The name Carlos Gardel is synonymous with Argentina.  He was the son that all women wished they had and the boyfriend that all women wished they could meet!  What's more, he sang some of the most beautiful tangos ever played, and are still very well-loved today.  EL DIA QUE ME QUIERAS features the title song, which he sings with great feeling and expression, as well as other great tango tunes.  In the film, Carlos plays himself and he is basically on tour in a city in Argentina, during a time of particular political unrest and upheaval.  He meets and romances a beautiful woman (Rosita Moreno) while numerous onlookers and fans swoon in the presence of the charismatic singer.

This film is particularly significant because it was remastered in Venezuela, after Gardel died in an airplane crash, and is one of his best and most well known films.  This is definitely worth a look from an historical point of view, as well as for all the Gardel fans out there.",1188518400,4,1154,4.645320197044335
8073079,5,B000A2X93S,"This is a 1930 Argentinian movie, simple very well acted, corny yes but beautifull with some of the songs composed, sung, acted by the inmortal Carlos Gardel. The movie as old as it is has very acceptable sound and video.",1168300800,4,221,4.55
