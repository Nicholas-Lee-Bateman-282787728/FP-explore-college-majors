8601220,5,B00E4V0BG4,Possibly the best Ramones thing available. Great performance by them especially by Dee Dee.,1462233600,,91,5.571428571428571
8601221,2,B00E4V0BG4,"The poor packaging, lack of information, bootleg audio/video quality, and absolute bear bones nature of this release doesn't really bother me.  I can deal with all of that just fine.  However, if you're going to go to the trouble of releasing a concert on DVD, the LEAST you can do is ensure that the audio and video are properly synced up.  They apparently couldn't be bothered with this little detail and it really makes this release a piece of garbage.  It's only slightly off, but it's just enough to pretty much ruin the viewing experience, especially given the fast tempo of the music featured.  This is an absolute scorcher of a performance, unfortunately rendered virtually unwatchable by this infuriating audio-visual misalignment.  To see this footage presented properly, check out the It's Alive 1974-1996 DVD.  It unfortunately doesn't contain the entire show, but what it does have is of superior quality.",1443484800,3,918,5.08
8601222,5,B00E4V0BG4,"Excellent performance by the Ramones in Germany from back in 1978.  This is the same show that is available with CD on the ""Ramones - The Musikladen Recordings"" DVD/CD but cheaper because there is no CD included and it is viewable on any DVD player in the US since it is in the NTSC format.  The video quality is not HD but is okay.  However the performance more than makes up for it.  There is no booklet or any bonus videos included.  They are not even introduced in the video and just goes straight into the music.  A MUST for any Ramones fan!",1436918400,2,546,4.252427184466019
8601223,5,B00E4V0BG4,"Several classic RAMONES tunes on this. Glad I found it. I saw the RAMONES in concert once in Kansas City. They played after SOUNDGARDEN then before METALLICA. This concert helps remind me what the experience was like.

25 songs on this tour they had in ' 78. Some notables and favorites of mine: Sheena is a punk rocker, Commando, Pinhead, Now I wanna sniff some glue. There's just gobs of classics played in this show.

 Strong recommendation to get this legendary concert. Rock On ! :)",1408492800,,487,4.6395348837209305
