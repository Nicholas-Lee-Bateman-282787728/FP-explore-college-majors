7805530,4,6300189287,"""Caravan to Vaccares"" is a loose adaptation of a bestselling novel by Alistair MacLean.  Viewers are encouraged to take the movie on its own terms, including its early 1970's dialogue, fashions, and sensibilities.  The lovely Charlotte Rampling gets lead billing as Lila, a freelance British photographer, but she isn't given a great deal to do.  The story really centers on Neill Bowman (David Birney), a somewhat disillusioned young American with surprising talents, who has been hired to do a job by the mysterious Duc de Croyter (nicely played by Michel Lonsdale).

The movie takes full advantage of its location shooting in the rugged but beautiful Camargue region of Provence in southern France.  The area is home to an annual Romany encampment, distinctive local music, and traditional bullfighting.  Bowman's mission is to protect a refugee scientist with a secret.  His opponents are utterly ruthless, and it is unclear whom he can trust.  The suspense is good right to the dramatic finish.  The film has been digitally remastered to an excellent quality and includes a more recent interview with David Birney.  Recommended as decent entertainment.",1525651200,,1157,5.273224043715847
7805531,3,6300189287,"Underwhelmed is the word that most comes to mind when I think of Alistair MacLeans Caravan to Vaccares and its hard to put a finger on which element is most to blame. There is certainly plenty of action with the hero (known only as Bowman) racing around battling all manner of baddies and a very beautiful Charlotte Rampling as the leading lady. But other than these elements it is ultimately forgettable.
The movie does start off rather slow, we are introduced to one of the chief villains who, forces a gypsy caravan off the road in an attempt to abduct the gypsies passenger (a defecting scientist). Before he can execute the kidnapping our hero happens along with Rampling (playing a photographer with an interest in gypsy culture) in tow. Of course our hero prevents the villain from executing his plan.
It seems that Bowman has been hired by the Duc de Croyter (played by the normally excellent Michael Lonsdale) to spirit the aforementioned defector to the United States. Croyter has used the gypsies for the purposes of his strategy since they are allowed to travel across national borders with little hindrance.
Im not sure particularly why they chose to, but for some unknown reason they felt the need to dub Lonsdale. The movie was released in 1974, the year after Lonsdale had appeared in Frederick Forsyths Day of the Jackal, so its clear that  Lonsdale had no issue with English, but here we are presented with a voice that is clearly not his own and a pretty languid voice at that.
The music doesnt do the movie any favors either. I cannot remember a single note of the tunes, only thinking that it seemed totally inappropriate and horribly limp. Its such a shame and is, without a doubt, my least favorite MacLean adaptation (even worse than the likes of Bear Island and Fear is the Key). A great deal of blame must fall with director Geoffrey Reeve who fails on almost all levels.
As I mentioned there is no shortage of action, Bowman engages in fisticuffs with several villainous types, is chased by goons on horseback, chases around a French city trying to catch up with a fleeing collaborator, hangs from a helicopter and ultimately faces off with a bull, but its all pretty limp in its execution.",1525219200,,2217,4.713917525773196

7805533,1,6300189287,"Whilst the story from Alistair Mclean is  gripping this must be one of the worst film adaptations ever produced.
I found an old VHS copy at a boot sale and picked it up for 50p (25c or less) and I think I was robbed at that. I was expecting something of the quality of The Guns Of Navarone, or Where Eagles Dare, both great film adaptations from the same author. I now know why this 1974 film has not made it to DVD or even a listing in Leonard Matlins  movie guide. Simply put it is quite dreadful. Slow paced and dull lacking a good cast",1489104000,,539,4.0754716981132075
7805534,5,6300189287,"I am collecting Alistair MacLean novels made into movies. This one, not in same category Of Guns of Navarone, Ice Station Zebra, but. . . a lot slower moving not the snap and polish with intrigue that the books lead you up to. Oh well one mans opinion. Enjoy, you might fine a diamond I missed.",1367798400,,294,4.267857142857143
7805535,4,6300189287,"Similar to his plot in ""The Secret Ways"", an American is asked to help a scientist escape an eastern block country. Along the way, he is pursued by villanous gypsies who want to keep the scientist from defecting, as well as eastern block spies who want to kill the scientist, rather than let his secret formula fall into the hands of the west. You never know who the good guys, and bad guys are until the exciting end, when he is fighting off a bull in the ring. It keeps you guessing all the time. I really enjoyed watching the movie, but it's been so long since I've read the book that I couldn't tell you how close the screen play stayed with the book it was based on.",1026000000,5,671,4.209302325581396
