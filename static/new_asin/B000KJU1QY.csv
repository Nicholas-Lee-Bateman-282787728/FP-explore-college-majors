8157613,5,B000KJU1QY,"Awesome! This is a great live seminar DVD - you feel like you're right there at the live seminar with the crowd, I had a great time watching it and have re-watched it a few times to get even more information out of it.  I love how I can pause it any time to take notes, and rewind the parts I really like to let them ""sink in.""

There's a lot of competition out there, and I feel like I have an edge now, from watching this.  It's like going back to school - but everything I learned is a lot more relevant and fun, coming from Brian Tracy.  I'm going to keep watching it over and over again, because we forget most of what we hear!  It's constant repetition, like watching the same thing a few times, that makes it stick. That's the real difference...

Great DVD, I recommend it!",1194480000,4,780,4.132450331125828
