893901,5,6304500831,"This movie is more than just another Disney masterpiece.  The Jungle Book is a great tale of friendship and adventure.  Although almost every animated feature that was created during Walt Disney's life is a classic,  this one in particular holds a special place in the heart of many men (and  now thanks to video and DVD, boys) who saw it while growing up.  There  isn't a boy alive who can see this movie and not want to be Mowgli.  What a  life it would be to live in the jungle, with friends like Baloo and  Bagheera.  It is every young boys dream to be so free.
That is not to say  that only boys will love this movie.  As with all Disney films, this one  will be enjoyed by all members of the family, young and old.  I saw it  growing up, and never forgot my memories of the movie, and the days  afterward, singing the songs and dreaming of adventure.
The music in  The Jungle Book is some of the best in any Disney movie.  ""The Bare  Necessities"" is simply one of the best songs ever.  Add in the fantastic  animation and the characters that come to life (who wouldn't believe a bear  could sing after seeing this?), and you have one of the many classic Disney  stories.
Starring the voices of Disney regulars Phil Harris and Sterling  Holloway, as well as Sebastian Cabot (Mr. French, to those of my  generation) and many others, this movie is too good to not buy.
Get a  copy of this DVD before Disney removes it for another generation.  It is  the best that Disney has to offer.",956966400,198,1487,4.3090909090909095
893902,5,6304500831,"By far, this is my favorite Disney & what does it is the music.  Some Disney films may have characters I love more with the great music, but this one does it.  Well done by the Sherman Brothers.",956361600,,194,4.078947368421052

893904,4,6304500831,"I have always loved this movie. It is my favorite Disney. The only thing that would have made it better would have been some extras and the suposed suround sound. Of the 9 DVD's in the boxed set (that all state they have  full color discs) 3 did not have ""full"" disc art including this  one. I don't care if it is the same as the VHS, This one will not break as  my VHS tape did and it is so much crisper in color and sound. If you don't  have it, get it. Hopefully they will not reissue this in a new  ""gold"" edition ala Pinnochio.",946857600,5,532,3.9345794392523366
893905,1,6304500831,my advice is - don't bother!  this dvd is exacty it`s the same as the vhs version! .it is NOT dolby surround as stated but only stereo and there are no extras on the disc at all.the colour and sound are the same as the vhs  version-not re-mastered or enhanced at all for dvd.if you have it on vhs  don't waste your money!,945648000,38,321,4.063492063492063

I still catch myself singing the songs whilst doing some chore. I bought a copy for  my cousins although my uncle is the one that wears out the tape! They live  in another county so I don't get the chance to see the movie much. I  foolishly didn't buy a copy for myself & desperatly want a copy to be  cherished in my home to share with my friends, so come on Disney re-release  the film pleeeeeeese.",943660800,4,532,4.076923076923077

I'm 53 years old and still watch it when I'm feeling blue.  My granddaughter loves King Louie and we sing the songs together.  My whole family gets a kick out of how much I love it.

I was recently very sick.  While I was in the hospital and completely out of it, my six year old grandson brought me his Bagheera stuffed animal and put it in my bed so I wouldn't get lonely.  My cup runneth over.

895504,5,6304500831,"The Jungle Book, one of Disney's ultimate classics, it has great characters, an awesome story and terrific animation. I'll admit it, I adore Disney movies, I could never choose just one Disney movie as my favorite, I love them all for so many different reasons. The Jungle Book is one of my fav's though, after buying the new release on DVD, I realized that I love this movie now more than ever. The reason that I think this movie is so wonderful is because of the characters, they just brought so much life to the story and really made this into a wonderful Disney classic.

Mowgli is found in a basket as a baby in the deep jungles. Bagheera, the panther who discovers the boy, promptly takes him to a wolf who has just had cubs. She raises him along with her own cubs and Mowgli soon becomes well acquainted to jungle life. Mowgli is shown ten years later, visiting the wolves and getting his face licked eagerly when he arrives. That night, when the wolf tribe learns that Shere Khan, a man-eating tiger, has returned to the jungle, they realize that Mowgli must be taken to the man village, to protect him and those around him. Bagheera volunteers to escort him back. They leave that very night, but Mowgli is determined to stay in the jungle and loses Bagheera. Kaa, the hungry python, hypnotizes Mowgli into a deep and peaceful sleep, traps him tightly in his coils, and tries to devour him, but comically fails. The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the elephant patrol. Bagheera finds Mowgli and they argue; Mowgli runs away from Bagheera. The boy soon meets up with the fun-loving bear Baloo, who shows Mowgli the fun of having a care-free life and promises not to take him to the man village. Mowgli now wants to stay in the jungle more than ever. Shere Khan is after Mawgli though and won't rest 'till he kills him.

Seriously, these are some of the most memorable characters in Disney history, we have Baloo, the care free party bear that just wants to have fun and only needs the ""bear"" necessities of life. Begheera, a panther, that we've all known this kind of person, the one that just wants to get down to business and get as much done as quickly as possible, the party pooper, but deep down still has that heart. And one of Disney's most memorable villains of all time, Shere Khan, voiced by George Sanders, classy, sassy, menacing and vicious, I wouldn't be surprised if he was Scar's inspiration(the lion villain in The Lion King). If you haven't seen The Jungle Book, just buy it, believe me, it's worth the money. It's a classic fun animated film that I will love forever, still to this day I will always sing along to Bear Necessities, it's a good time.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

The fine subtleties in character movement shine. The brilliant Shere Kahn animated by legendary Animator Milt Kahl. The refined shoulder movement, I'm getting chills just thing about it. Bagheera's beautiful movements by legendary animator Ollie Johnston as well as Kahl... these animators hit it out of the park with the elegance of the quadruped animation this film contains. Don't even get me started on the brilliance in Mowgli's animation by again ledgendary animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas.

I am a huge disney fan but i don't like the way disney interpreted this classic. The story of jungle book is about how a man cub bonds with the wolfs (especially his wolf mom) and his fight with Sherkhan. Disney doesnt give attention to either of this and made this another princess movie. Emotions are never considered a big part of this movie, so watch it at your own risk.

I own almost all the disney movies released till date, but this movie i will never watch twice.",1461974400,,595,4.36036036036036

896845,5,6304500831,"The Jungle Book 2016 movie is inescapable. I read Kipling's book, written 120 years ago, as a kid and immediately went out and started swinging on Weeping Willows like a monkey. I watched the 1967 animated version in rooted disappointment. Then the 1994 live-action film appeared to be shot in a zoo. But last night I walked into a theater for just a peek before continuing to the movie I had bought a ticket for.  I was riveted in my seat in the first minute, and could not leave until the credits rolled to the end.

Mowgli the man cub is raised by a Wolf and her pack ever since he was brought to them as a baby by the Black Panther. Mowgli is taught the ways of the wolf, and the Law of the Pack, as I was as a Cub Scout: For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack. The boy faces certain challenges and is chastised for solving them with his man tricks such as using ropes and cunning.  He grows into a man-wolf learning the languages of the Elephant, Ape, Boa, Birds and every animal of the jungle, while slowly realizing that one day he will battle the Lord of the bush, the wicked Tiger.

The jungle is portrayed not as in the original 60s version of a wilderness to overcome, and not as neutral as the military suggests, but as my jungle survivor teacher taught, the jungle is your friend. And so the red flower  Fire  evolves different uses through the century along with the audiences, but always makes a cameo appearance at the end.

The cast was announced throughout 2014 with many famous voices leaping at the chance to become invisible animals before the mike. The search for casting Mowgli was extensive, with thousands of children auditioning from the USA and worldwide. Eventually, newcomer Neel Sethi of New York was confirmed for the role, and the 12-year old played it to the hilt. A natural.

Sethi underwent Parkour training in preparation for the role. Parkour is a training discipline that developed from military obstacle course training, or in my case before the word was born, from Boy Scout obstacle training courses. I saw early on the person who could cut the sharpest hypotenuse on the flat, and glide through the mud, and over the vertical wall, would be the fastest and earn a merit badge. It was just a matter of angles, which is easily viewed in Mowglis movement through the jungle to save his skin.

The movie is shot beautifully and though the only live actor is Mowgli, I was fooled. The Jungle Book is running wild over the competition in theaters, so don't be surprised if you have to fight for a seat.",1461628800,,2582,4.464968152866242

I was used to the VHS version from the early 90's and I thought it was a bit odd that this DVD is widescreen. The VHS version definitely used a standard screen aspect ratio, so I thought there might have been some cropping to achieve the widescreen aspect. Other reviews can back this up, but it's debatable which aspect is the proper one. While the cropping bothers me a little, there's something that bothers me more. Parts of this movie are interlaced! It's not noticeable throughout the whole movie but certain scenes with a lot of motion have a disgusting combing effect. If they went back to the original film source and recorded it for this DVD, why did they need to apply interlacing? The price of this DVD isn't exactly cheap. Is it a single layer DVD? Maybe they could have sprung for dual layer discs and provided cleaner progressive scan content.",1455494400,,993,4.461538461538462

898957,2,6304500831,"This rewiew is for the 2015 Blu-Ray re-release of this Disney film that was originally released in 1967.  The Blu-Ray video and audio transfers are very good. According to the introduction by Disney songwriter Richard M. Sherman, this is the very first release in binaural stereo--all prior releases were in monophonic sound. This was the last major production that Walt Disney personally worked on--he died of lung cancer in 1966 before the general release.

The movie itself is OK, but I would not consider it ""Classic"" in the same class as ""Snow White,""  ""Bambi,"" ""Fantasia"" and other earlier projects: The  animation and drawings are good, but not as intricate or elaborate as earlier efforts. The story is also very shallow and saccharine which is probobly appropriate for young children, but does not make for an interesting or memorable movie. According to the commentary track, the original storyline was too dark for Walt. He fired the original production team and re-worked the story into the current ""lighter"" form. I think that the original story probobly would have been better, but that is a matter of taste.

Anyway, I think that there are many better Disney feature cartoons available. Get this only if you are a completist collector or have already seen the move and really like it. Otherwise, spend your money on a something else.",1442448000,,1348,5.0

 THE JUNGLE BOOK was the last movie that Walt Disney directly oversaw. The finished picture in no way resembles Rudyard Kipling's original story, as Disney felt this was too dark for a cartoon. With top notch songs like ""The Bear Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You,"" talented performers and animation that was part Xerox, part hand drawn, ""The Jungle Book"" is a fitting career closer from the greatest name in family motion picture entertainment, Walt Disney.

JUNGLE BOOK TRIVIA--

The Beatles were to record voiceovers for ""The Vultures,"" but conflicting schedules made it impossible.

The song ""Trust in Me,"" originally called ""Sands of Time,"" was almost used in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MARY-POPPINS/dp/6304806469/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MARY POPPINS</a>&nbsp;(1964).

From this era of Disney, this is clearly one of the most memorable not just for it's amazing soundtrack but also the theme. In many ways, this is the precursor to the Lion King - a young male separated from his parents and raised by animals - but with a much simpler outcome.

Nevertheless, this is one of Disney's finest and if you have children under 7 or 8 they should own a copy of this on their device.",1430697600,,688,4.126865671641791

899933,5,6304500831,"Inspired by the Rudyard Kipling ""Mowgli"" Stories, with a screen adaptation story by: Larry Clemmons; Ken Anderson; Ralph Wright and Vance Gerry, the wonderful world of animation from Walt Disney, presents this classic favorite with every new generation: THE JUNGLE BOOK. Centered within a jungle in India, this 78-minute, digitally mastered, color, ""swinging-singing classic"" that's 'Rated G', comes to it's audience on a single-disc, DVD in spoken English with subtitles in: English, French and Spanish. It is Directed by: Wolfgang Reitherman and features the voice talents of: Bruce Reitherman as ""Mowgli"" the Man-Cub/Man-Child; J.Pat O'Malley as ""Colonel Hathi"" the Elephant Herd Leader; Phil Harris as ""Baloo"" the carefree Bear; Sebastian Cabot as ""Bagheera"" the kindly Panther; Louis Prima is the swinging ""King Louie"" of the Orangutans; George Sanders is the fearsome and dreaded ""Shere Khan"" the Tiger; And the sneakiest, most hypnotic, slithering Snake within THE JUNGLE BOOK is ""Kaa"", as voiced by: Sterling Holloway; And Darlene Carr is ""The Girl"", who is the first human who befriends ""Mowgli the Man-Cub."" This animated, colorful, Walt Disney, delight: THE JUNGLE BOOK, centers around Mowgli - an infant boy, who ends up alone within a jungle. Bagheera the wise and kindly, old Panther, finds Mowgli and realizing that he needs attentive care which is something that he cannot give him, places Mowgli's' basket crib near the den of a Mother Wolf, who had recently given birth to a litter of wolf cubs. Rama - the Father Wolf, allowed the Man Cub Mowgli, too stay with the Wolf Herd, until he was 10 years old. Why ten? Because in the tenth year, a fearsome and dreaded stalker, named: Shere Khan the terrorizing Tiger, returned to that part of the jungle where the Wolf Herd and the Man Cub roamed, stayed and played, together. Knowing that a pack of wolves was no match for a large and ferocious Tiger, especially like Shere Khan, the Wolf Pack met and had a council meeting. And, it was with great reluctance, decided that Shere Khan ""...will surely kill the boy and all who protect him"" and that he'd be better off, with his own kind. Humans. The Panther Bagheera offers to escort Mowgli to the nearest village of settlers, but Mowgli prefers to stay within the jungle that he's grown to love. Taking matters into his own young hands, he eludes Bagheera, so that he wouldn't have to be placed with his own kind. Human beings. His jungle odyssey, animal encounters, included: Baloo the carefree Bear, King Louie and his band of Orangutans, Colonel Hathi and his Elephant Troop, Kaa the self-serving, hypnotic Snake and then finally, he has a face-to-face confrontation with Shere Khan the Tiger. And each depicted animal encounter is a lesson in life for the Man Child, Mowgli. But by then, the jungle animals had adopted him as one of their own and having formed friendships, there was one animal within the human jungle that all the jungle animals and even Mowgli himself, could not help but be smitten by. A young and pretty, female human. How does it all, play out? That... Dear Reader, is for you and your family, too see! In addition too, hearing melodic songs by: Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman with Music and Orchestration by: George Burns and Walter Sheets, respectively. Then, you will quickly see, just why THE JUNGLE BOOK is a delightful, Walt Disney, Animated Classic. And, as a JUNGLE BOOK/DVD Bonus: There is a Special Introduction by: Diane Disney Miller (Walt Disney's' Daughter); A deleted scene segment, in that you: Meet the Lost Character of Rocky the Rhino. And then, you get a first hand look at: Junglemania & DisneyPedia. Plus, you can sing along with the additional vocal talents of: Phil Harris (Baloo the Bear), as he sings THE JUNGLE BOOK/Hit Song: ""The Bare Necessities"", as written by: Terry Gilkyson. So, all in all, if you're an animal lover and enjoy Walt Disney Animated Classic's, then this THE JUNGLE BOOK/DVD is for you. It's delightful, colorful, entertaining and is a wonderful, big-screen, jungle story that's full of adorable animals, memorable music scores and sing-a-long songs plus, friendship..., jungle style!

900291,4,6304500831,"I purchased this for my daughter through Amazon Instant Video. I had no trouble with my purchase, no picture problems or play issues. I was expecting the picture to be dull, considering the age of the movie, but it is not. In fact I'd say the picture is more vibrant than I remember it. My daughter was happy with the movie and she is used to Pixar, high detail, fancy schmancy type quality in the movies she watches now. I guess some things really are timeless and Disney does have kids' entertainment down to a science.

The only reason why I take off a star is because I think this movie is too violent for a young child. I honestly would not show this to a kid under age 6. My daughter is 3 and I wish I had waited a while. She is a total scaredy cat though and HIGHLY impressionable so use your own judgement, but for us this was VERY inappropriate for my daughter's age.

I was sitting with my daughter and during the fighting scenes I was covering her eyes. I hadn't seen this movie since I was about 10 years old (I'm almost 30) and I had completely forgotten how graphic and sad it had gotten in some scenes. In the end I couldn't remember if Baloo died or not (I haven't read the book in years either and couldn't remember how they differed) and I was literally sobbing (darn hormones) through the last parts of the movie. My daughter was in my lap with her head buried in my shoulder saying, ""Is he gonna be okay? Is he? Is he?"" I can't believe my parents let me and my brother watch this when we were my daughter's age! If I had remembered it I would never have allowed my daughter to see it until she was MUCH older!

Not only that, but there's a lot of hitting, punching, and swatting in the movie which is partly playful boyishness and partly because Mowgli's a kid raised by wolves... hello. But my daughter is too little to get that. She is in a hitting phase right now which we have been trying to nip in the bud. Now her favorite excuse for hitting and swatting if she gets mad is that she's being a ""man cub."" I so, so, so wish I had remembered that from my own childhood (this was one of my favorite movies as a kid and I foolishly and impulsively bought it and played it immediately without pre-screening it...) but I kind of expected more from Disney! I guess I was forgetting about the PTSD I suffered from watching Pinocchio and Bambi as a kid. I'll remember to prescreen next time!",1423008000,,2407,4.239651416122005

Mowgli ventures away from them all and some vultures take pity on him and try to help him out. Eventually he finds a village with people and is entranced by a girl whom he follows. That ends his time spent in the jungle. Excellent story and music, highly enjoyable to watch.",1421625600,,704,4.3007518796992485

900853,5,6304500831,"An early draft of this film followed Kipling's work more closely; reportedly, it was dark and sinister, and quite dramatic.  So naturally Disney, with his dying breath put a halt to that, removing writer Bill Peet and composer Terry Gilkyson from the project.  It was also Disney's idea to make the vultures look and sound like The Beatles.  He even wanted them to voice the characters and sing the song, ""That's What Friends Are For.""  John Lennon was not amused by the suggestion.  The movie was released 10 months after Disney died.  It was a huge success.  The song The Bare Necessities was nominated for an Oscar but lost to Talk to the Animals.

This movie boasts a lot of established actors for the voice work, most of whom did little to hide their trademark voices (conjuring up unwanted images of the actors as the characters spoke).  How many times did they need Winnie the Pooh (Sterling Holloway) to unofficially `appear' in so many movies, sounding exactly like Sterling Holloway?  In this case, it's impossible to think of Winnie the Pooh as a sneaky snake.

This movie has a lot of great songs, considerable humor, and only a smidgen of danger.  It's always a joy to watch.",1418083200,,1188,4.685990338164252

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Mowgli [Bruce Reitherman] the man-cub has been raised by wolves in the Indian jungle since his birth. However, when the wolves learn that the ferocious tiger Shere Kahn [George Sanders] is making his way through the jungle and is looking for food, they decide to send Mowgli to a local man tribe to be safe. On his way to the village he meets a host of interesting, funny, scary and friendly characters that all find Mowgli fascinating, one of these characters - Baloo the Bear [Phil Harris] becomes firm friends with Mowgli and helps him on his travels. But Shere Khan is never far away.

The Jungle Book was Walt Disney's 19th animated feature and was released too much acclaim in 1967. Loosely based on the Rudyard Kipling novel of the same name, the screenwriters removed some of the darker content so as not to scare the younger audience. This is one of the main reasons why it has such a wide appeal to any age group.

From the opening scenes where the Wolves have to move Mowgli, we were entranced into how he would develop as a human alongside the animals, but also would he be able to evade Shere Khan or become another one of his mighty conquests. Whilst quite a savage idea initially, the story really comes into its own when the cast of characters pop up along the way. The wise, old Panther Bagheera who dishes out some sound advice for the young boy, is a joy and he also becomes a guiding light for Mowgli in his travels.

One of our favourite parts of The Jungle Book is the visit to the palace of crazy King Louie the orang-utan, and he is one of the most crazy characters Disney have ever produced! But we can't help but laugh at his ruling antics over his subjects and his singing.

The way the animators and voice cast put evilness into Shere Khan and Kaa the snake will never be forgotten no matter what age we are and they are two of the most dangerous and frightening characters ever seen on screen. However, the story is lightened up by the appearance of Baloo the Bear, a slow moving, no-troubles type character that is loved by all and hated by none. His love of Mowgli is a wonder to see, and it really shows towards the end of the film.

But we always want to hear him sing The Bear Necessities, a song that has lasted throughout the years and never gets old. There is something very fitting about the song, and Phil Harris [voice of Baloo] had such a wonderfully dulcet tone to his voice that it never moves throughout the whole range. We wish we had a Baloo to keep us company!

The animation is some of the best Walt Disney has ever produced. The animals are incredibly drawn with such precision it must have taken hours for each cell to be made. But what really stands out is the background artwork; having most of the film set in the jungle would have been tricky but the artists that worked on the background have done such a masterful job. It's difficult to ignore what is happening in the background, with just the leaves of a tree floating to the ground or the steady water running down stream.

The Jungle Book was also the first time that many of the primary vocal artists in an animated Disney animation film were stars in their own right. Disney animated features had always been well cast but only rarely with easily recognizable star voices. Here, apart from the voice of Mowgli, the voice talent on display was stellar, and the roles couldn't be better or more ingratiatingly cast. Phil Harris walks away with the picture as the easy-going Baloo, Sterling Holloway hisses coyly as Raa, and Sebastian Cabot grounds the film rather regally as Bagheera. And no one can do haughty and intimidating like George Sanders.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The film is presented at a 1.75:1 aspect ratio and is delivered in 1080p resolution. For those who found the scrubbed look of previous releases like 'The Sword in the Stone' problematic, there won't be any relief from worry with this release. Grain is once again a mere memory, and the DNR [Digital Noise Reduction] applied has a deleterious effect on fine-line animation like whiskers on the animals, which seem to fade in and out if one looks closely. Motion sometimes gets affected by the processing, too, blurring certain shots strangely. Sharpness ebbs and flows as well with all the processing especially in certain shots that aren't close-ups. Colour is balanced and strong without any bleeding, and there is no banding to be seen. Please Note: Playback Region B/2 and C/3: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix doesnt make full use of that wide soundstage, but it certainly is the best the film as ever sounded on home video. The musical numbers find themselves spread through the available channels and occasionally some of George Bruns background score is also expanded beyond the front soundstage, and there is one neat effect where a voices echoes bounce around the rears. But most of the dialogue has been placed in the centre channel.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Introductions [1080p] [2:00] Diane Disney-Miller and songwriter Richard Sherman give separate introductions to the film. They are brief, but nice all the same.

Special Feature: Never Seen Before: Insuring a Future for Wildlife and Wild Places [4:00] Is a commercial promoting Disney's positive work with nature's creatures, from their extensive cinematic history to the Animal Kingdom theme park in Orlando, Florida.

Special Feature: Alternate Ending: Mowgli and the Hunter [1080p] [9:00] There's a brand new ""recently discovered"" alternate ending for the movie which apparently they'd only had a script for, so a present day artist storyboarded the whole idea out and animated and narrated it and is animated, sketch-y storyboard form. To be honest, it's an absolutely terrible idea for an ending, and I can see why it got scrapped and lost. In this version, Mowgli goes to the village, while meeting a new hunter villain, and finds his original parents. After living with them for a short while, he goes back to the jungle. The hunter then believes there's treasure in the jungle and goes to the ape city to try to get it. There's also a showdown with Shere Khan that ends in his death. The version seen in the finished film is infinitely better.

Special Feature: Growing Up With Nine Old Men [2013] [45:00] For those who don't know, Disney's Nine Old Men were the original group of core animators who worked for Walt Disney. The bonus short features Ted speaking with the other ""kids"" the grown-up sons and daughters of Walt Disney's Nine Old Men. I found this bonus feature very charming, and it was interesting to glimpse into the world of the Nine Old Men from a different point of view. Ted Thomas is an amiable and folksy interviewer, and clearly has a kinship with those who went through a similar childhood as he did.

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Richard Sherman (half of the song-writing team), Andreas Deja (current Disney animator and fan of the film), and Bruce Reitherman (voice of Mowgli and son of the director): Consider this audio track a master class in professional appreciation: each participant extols the virtues of the ""Jungle Book,"" from the character animation quirks to the unforgettable soundtrack. While it lacks a coldly informational tone, it's nonetheless a treat to hear those connected to the production point out the idiosyncrasies of the animation film. For added historical oomph, archival audio recordings of Larry Clemmons (screenwriter), Ollie Johnston (animation legend), and Wolfgang Reitherman (director) are included in the discussion.

Special Feature: The Bare Necessities: The Making of The Jungle Book [2007] [480i] [46:27] This is a really marvellous encapsulation of how the film came to be and Walt Disney's lasting impressions. This documentary is one of the most interesting and revealing on any of the Disney classics, not shying away from some of the turmoil that occurred behind-the-scenes before The Jungle Book made it to the screen.

Special Feature: Music and More: Deleted Songs [21:00] Presents the full work of composer Terry Gilkyson, who was replaced by the Sherman Brothers once Walt Disney decided to flip The Jungle Book project sunny-side up. The songs collected here seem more suited to a Rankin/Bass special than a feature film, but it's an invaluable piece of history, allowing viewers a rare listen to the film's more ambitious origins. The audio quality is a little rough and possibly from a phonograph source, and contains the tracks: ""Brothers All;"" ""The Song of the Seeonee;"" ""The Bare Necessities"" (a demo version of the lone song that wasn't discarded); ""Monkey See; Monkey Do;"" ""I Knew I Belonged To Her;"" ""In A Day's Work"" and ""The Mighty Hunters"" and if you want to know why the heart of rock & roll has stopped beating, watch this train wreck of a cover song.

Special Feature: Sing Along With The Movie: Disney Song Selection [13:00] Offers up some karaoke, with the songs ""Colonel Hathi's March; ""Bare Necessities;"" ""I Wan'na Be Like You"" and ""That's What Friends Are For."" You can view the scenes with or without lyrics.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes: The Lost Character [7:00] Rocky the Rhino is a short feature exploring the deleted character of Rocky, a dim-witted rhinoceros (voiced by Frank Fontaine) who factored into Mogwli's interaction with the Beatlesque vultures. Walt just wasn't feeling the continual aggression toward the Man-Cub was benefiting the animation film's pace, thus a removal of Rocky and a slight reinvention of the vultures was in order. Rocky's scene is presented here in a series of fully-voiced storyboards.

Special Feature: Disneypedia [480i] [14:00] Here we take a trip into the jungles of India to learn about the real life counterparts to your favourite animals that you see in the Disney animation film The Jungle Book.

Finally, The Jungle Book is an exquisite family film that never becomes old, no matter how many times you see it. The animation film feels like it could live on forever and especially with this brand new UK exclusive Disney Diamond Limited Edition SteelBook Blu-ray, which is only available to us in the United Kingdom. The quality is breath taking and does the animation film justice with a great selection of added extras that will keep the family entertained for hours. The animation is beautifully crafted, the story is heart-warming and the songs just put a huge smile on your face, which you will automatically sing-a-long to. A classic in every sense of the term and that is why I am so proud to have this in my Walt Disney Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

This is great animated film--rich colors and great details--
the voices of the characters are perfect ---so distinct to each character--bumptious, sly, pompous, and very slitherinly snakey--
many more current animated films use voice overs that are often generic and interchangeable -- even though they might use name stars, they seem to be more for star value than for how well they portray the characters' personalities...

Disney has had a mixed bag of animated films but this one is from its Golden Age...

902838,5,6304500831,"When I first watched this, I was amazed at the vibrant colors in the animation.  The sound is fantastic on a 5.1 home theater system.  Disney did a great job remastering the original so that it looks and sounds great.

One thing that I really like about this movie is that when you pause it, it shifts into intermission mode, and starts a sing-along complete with animation.  It rotates through several of the more popular songs in the movie if you let it run.  When someone needs to take a quick break, the fun keeps right on rolling even though the movie is paused.",1402185600,6,567,4.413461538461538

902842,5,6304500831,"Being the last animation that the late Walt Disney was involved with, The Jungle Book is another great classic.  Anyone watching this movie now will immediately be struck by the smooth, flowing movement of the animation, the leisurely and sensible pacing of the story, and the appropriate match between the musical soundtrack and the setting.

Current Disney cartoon animations rely too heavily on CGI (computer-generated imagery), frantic pacing and dialog, and employ music that doesn't fit the era or the setting of the plot.  The current character voices also consistently use the same tired urban slang-infused lines even in period pieces.  Walt must be rolling in his grave now.  Don't get me wrong on the choice of music.  The jazz music soundtrack for The Jungle Book wouldn't normally fit a jungle setting but it doesn't stray too far unlike the generic top 40 pop music that peppers period pieces today.  Example: the ""Frozen"" title song against an old European setting.  It's pop with a tinge of....modern country!

The Blu-Ray edition of The Jungle Book appears to reveal the same treatment that other classic Disney animations have received.  Color saturation has been increased (probably more than what was originally intended), contrast has been increased, and the overall appearance is more solid and clean.  Personally, I see it as an improvement because it helps to anchor the viewer's attention to the story.  The sound has also been updated to 21st century standards.  Whereas the original release was stereo then later re-released in matrixed Dolby Surround, the current Blu-Ray and DVD versions have been remixed for 5.1 surround.  The result is clean, dynamic, enveloping surround ambience as well as various sound effects appropriately placed in the surround channels according to specific scene details (picture birds flying behind you and King Louie's monkeys taunting Baloo The Bear from behind you while Baloo is in front of you, putting you in the middle of the action).

The characterization bowdlerized, the wise bear turned into a clown, the sage snake into Disney's own trivialization of the Serpent, the Panther Bagheera turned into a cat, and a sexed-up ending. Man goes back to Man because an 8-year old boy follows a seductive 8-year old girl. OK, Walt. Where's Marlyn Monroe?

I read the book shortly after seeing this garbage. A tribute to the great Rudyard Kipling, as bigoted as he was. Not even Disney's homogenized ""American"" pap can seize the brain like Kipling. I have a vivid memory of the Mowgli stories, punctuated by Rikki-Tikki-Tavi et al. The Disney garbage, just a stupid cartoon seen while passing through a room.

903239,3,6304500831,"I will preface this by saying Disney's The Jungle Book has never been one of my favorite classic ""Vault Disney"" movies.  That being said, I am a huge Disney buff and enjoy just about anything the studio has put out in terms of Theatrical Animation with very few exceptions (read: Home on the Range, Chicken Little).

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are some great special features on here including an alternate ending in story board form that I never even knew existed.  Spoiler free: I'll just say I am glad that they didn't go with the overly dark and non-Disney alternate ending!  The songs (for example ""Bare Necessities"") are all relatively as catchy as ever, the characters are mostly like-able (Baloo, etc.), and the animation is beautifully well-restored.

REVIEW:

Where my rating drops from the traditional 5 stars I would give to a classic Disney movie of this nature to the 3 stars I did rate it, is in that this movie unlike say Cinderella or Beauty & the Beast feels very dated.  That is despite the restoration and remastering of the audio in full HD, the movie is still left feeling antique.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but movies that are just as old like Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty just don't have this same ""dated"" feeling.

Back in the 90's there were many tie-ins to the characters such as TaleSpin and The Jungle Book 2, as well as Disney World/Land attractions.  However, there are really no ""current"" or ""modern"" tie-ins to these characters that I am aware of (although I've read of multiple upcoming Live-Action motion pictures in the works).

Therefore, if you're considering purchasing this for your kids, I think you would be safer to pass on this one and go with one of the many other classic Disney animations such as Cinderella, Aladdin, Sleeping Beauty, Beauty & the Beast, etc.  I think The Jungle Book comparatively will quickly lose your kids attention spans and there aren't really any relatable characters to children.

RECOMMENDATION:

If you currently own the Platinum edition DVD release on the last vault cycle, the additional special features not contained on the Platinum edition do not warrant an upgrade in my opinion, nor does the albeit impressive at times HD picture and sound.  With upconversion a standard on current blu-ray players automatically upgrading your dvd to ""relative hi-def"", the only time you would notice any difference in picture or audio quality would be if you have an obscenely large tv (read: 65+ inches) or a killer 7.1 surround sound audio setup.  If you're an 80's kid or earlier, or grew up watching TaleSpin on the Disney afternoon block, or you are just a huge Disney fan like I am, is the only reasoning I would give to list this as a ""must buy"".",1397433600,4,2727,4.768085106382979

903311,5,6304500831,"I would say Snow White is Disney's greatest accomplishment--especially considering a full-length animated feature had never been done. Sleeping Beauty had the best backgrounds. The Jungle Book has the best characters. The basic story is rather simplistic: A boy really needs to return to the man-village as the jungle is too dangerous for him--even with the help of his animal friends. What really works is the personalities of the characters, allowing the voice actors to really shape the character rather than just read off a script.

904432,5,6304500831,"As I post this review there are already over 700 reviews of this film. I would like to point out that Amazon has a policy of combining all formats of a film (theater, DVD, Bluray and Amazon Instant) together when providing reviews. I always recommend that those seeking a review of a DVD or Bluray sort by date  you can choose newest first  - and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing.  Some of the reviews here go back to 2007 even before Bluray! This review is of the Bluray Combo pack version (including the Bonus Features).

I won't spend a lot of time discussing the film itself because  honestly  its a classic. Yes, its only 78 minutes long (just over an hour) but it has five great songs in it. Ill let you read others comments on the story ( an adaptation of Rudyard Kiplings stories) but Ill point out that one of the NEW special features this time is an 8-minute featurette where we see the story booked  version  of a recently discovered alternate ending, which is narrated by one of the new generation of Disney animators.

The Bluray version looks great. Its really sharp. Of course, it is so sharp that the black outlines of each hand drawn character (yes, this was made before computers!) are clearly visible. No, Im not complaining; just pointing out for the CGI generation.

The bonus features are divided into two sections:  The new ones show up first and then there is a section for the Classic bonuses from prior editions of the films home video release. The new ones include: a nine-minute interview with composer Richard Sherman,  an 18-minute one on the Animal Kingdom Disney Park (only tangentially related to the film), a 9-minute feature on Disneys in-house SPARK program where animators can pitch  new ideas to their peers.  And Bear-E-Oke, which lets you sing along to the five songs. This last feature isn't that necessary either since the Classic Bonuses includes the option to jump to the same songs with subtitles to sing along with.  So, honestly, the best bonus is the Sherman interview though an upgrade to this addition - for those who treasure the film and have an HD TV and BD player  is the print itself.

I think Walt would be very happy with this new release of the last film he was personally involved with.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

904433,4,6304500831,"Walt Disney Home Entertainment pulls another classic out of the vault and delivers it in a brand new high-definition package. ""The Jungle Book"" is the latest jewel in the crown of the Mouse House to hit Blu-ray in a Diamond Edition. The release will no doubt have Disney fans everywhere clapping their hands in glee.

Mowgli is a boy raised in the jungle since infancy by the animals. As he grows older, he journeys into the wild to discover who he is. He's accompanied on his trip by a bear named Baloo, who helps keep him safe as he meets all sorts of friendly and malicious creatures along the way.

""The Jungle Book"" Diamond Edition is presented in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 1.75:1. The picture is clear and the colors of the jungle and its creatures are vibrant and warm. There will be some complaints that the film is too clean and has lost its original cinematic flavor because of its digital upgrade. I found it to be a pleasant watch visually, however.

A 7.1 DTS-HD mix was given for ""The Jungle Book"" Diamond Edition. It enhances all the song numbers and atmospheric noises one would expect to hear in the jungle. The surround sound mix is something Walt Disney himself probably never imagined possible. It really beefs up the home viewing experience.

""The Jungle Book"" Diamond Edition includes over two hours of bonus material. There's behind-the-scenes featurettes like ""Sparking Creativity,"" ""Music, Memories, Mowgli,"" and I Wan'na Be Like You."" ""Bear-E-Oke"" Sing-Along will get the children in your household whooping and hollering in joy. Special Introductions to the movie are provided by Diane Disney Miller and Richard M. Sherman. We also get an alternate ending, ""Disneypedia: Junglemania,"" and more.

Lovers of all things Disney will find ""The Jungle Book"" Diamond Edition an absolute must-have addition to their home entertainment library. I wish I could say I appreciate this release as much as others. However, I don't find it as charming and irresistible as some. There's too much song and dance and not enough action for my tastes. Kids love it and that's all that counts in the end.",1394064000,2,2130,4.87292817679558

The songs are top-notch ~ not a single one that doesn't make your toe tap or cause you to sing along. A great movie for all ages.",1393372800,,428,4.296296296296297

Picture is great - story is pretty good. I would rate this a very good 8.5 to 9.0 - just shy of being great. This movie seems to be passed over sometimes during discussions about what Disney movies are thought to be among the best 3 or 4 which seems a little unfair to me.

Music is super and voice talent was great.

I would recommend this for animation fans,  Disney fans and anyone young at heart - how can 'The Bare Necessities' not bring a smile to your face!!",1393286400,,699,4.1940298507462686

904851,1,6304500831,"Jungle Book is clearly NOT a restoration in the broadest sense. As again with other films (Like Robin Hood), they have butchered the film for the apparent sake of convenience. I can't think of any other reason why. The film has been CROPPED from its original release. They have chopped off sections of the film to give it the look of widescreen. Jungle Book was never shown in widescreen so this is an altered image. I have no idea why Disney can't truthfully RESTORE a film. Admittedly the picture quality and sound are great. But I expect Disney to restore a film properly and actually DO IT. It seems that you can not post images here but there are links below to image comparisons of the original release and the DVD version. Yes the color is good and the image has been cleaned up. But especially look at the parts of the animation that have been cut off. Especially when it is parts of characters. Disney, at least offer us a choice of how we want to see the film. As it was originally intended, with all the artwork and labor of the artists included. Or your way, with chopped off images and distorted picture to falsely accommodate those with widescreen TVs. Take note that those of us that bought widescreen TVs did so so we could appreciate films as they were made as some were indeed in widescreen. Jungle Book was NOT in widescreen so I have no idea why you chose to cut it to give it that appearance.

New DVD release. Mowgli and Baloo both badly cropped.  [...]

905257,1,6304500831,"I can't believe that Disney actually did this! I just viewed my new Blu-ray of The Jungle Book Diamond Edition.

First off; I noticed that the movie was widescreen. Now, I own the original DVD and have also owned the VHS and the Laserdisc as well and I can assure you that this movie was never widescreen! I went back to my DVD and viewed it. Upon comparison, I noticed that in order for Disney to make it widescreen, they had to crop off the top and bottom of the picture. In some scenes it even cuts off Baloo's head feet.

I feel so sad and sorry for the original artists who worked so hard on this movie. All that beautiful animation they did has been cut off. It's sad! I'm not sure why Disney would do this. All I can tell you is that it's almost unwatchable! They didn't do it to Bambi or Alice in Wonderland, So why Jungle Book. I've been waiting for this Blu-ray release for years.

I have some fond childhood memories of this film. My dear Grandmother took me to see this movie when I was a kid. It was this first time she ever took me out alone. A wonderful day. It's a treasured memory for me. But now Disney has managed to crush the viewing of it. If they wanted to give the new kid viewers a screen that fills the TV, they should have given us both versions in the set or at least given a choice when purchasing.

Secondly; If you try to pause the film for whatever reason, after 5 seconds, the screen automatically goes to a narrative screen about the movie that CAN NOT be bypassed. It's very irritating!

I'm going to return this Jungle Book Blu-ray. Hopefully it will send a message to Disney...Maybe they'll get it!",1392422400,22,1634,4.258064516129032

905326,2,6304500831,"This cartoon was ANIMATED in a ratio of 1.37. Disney claim it was designed to be framed later at 1.75 as is the case with this release. However although it is true many cinemas did show it at the wide ratio in the US this was not always the case in other markets where it was widely shown using the full original animation. It is also fact that all early video releases were in the full frame ratio. Even the most cursory comparison will show the wide screen cut loses a huge amount of the frame and is tight and very unsatisfactory. I have compared this with my full frame DVD and I have not the slightest reservation in stating that that is the release I would have preferred on Blu-ray. I do not like this transfer at all despite the obvious technical improvements as it completely fails to grab the soul of the production. Shame on you Disney, you have also wrecked Robin Hood and The Sword in the Stone in the same way! If you have the old full frame DVDs keep them as they will become a treasure. If you can find a copy grab it as it is just so much better",1392163200,11,1062,4.160194174757281

I purchased the movie anyway, although I have found images on google that show the actually DVD cover I prefer. I will even be contacting the disney home entertainment hotline to determine if they will releasing a DVD and Blu ray only version that will match the other DVDs with a blue rim. I just cant quite understand why they would do this change. Has only heard of a later release of the simple blu ray and DVD edition or know where I can buy it? Despite my love for the movie the packaging has really ruined it for me",1392163200,2,862,4.167664670658683

905329,5,6304500831,Bought as present; the kids really loved it. It is a great classic by Disney. Can hardly beat the music.,1392076800,,104,4.25
905330,5,6304500831,"I hadn't seen Disney's The Jungle Book in at least 15 years but I was surprised by how much of the movie I remembered - even the animal's iconic expressions were burnt into my memory! What I never experienced as a kid, though, was how absolutely GORGEOUS this movie is.

The Blu Ray transfer is a work of art! The jungle foliage provides plenty of opportunity for animators to show off their craft, and they certainly do. This may be one of the most visual Disney movies ever. I was entranced by the animation this go around, with my adult eye, but even still the story is great fun. Not the most complex plot in the Disney canon, but fabulous none the less. Also, the aspect ratio of this movie is 1.75:1 which means it will fill up your whole TV.

OVERALL: I buy pretty much all the Disney blu rays, especially anything from the Diamond series, but their new transfers still amaze me. This one exceeded even my high expectations. It truly is like watching it again for the first time. If you've ever been a fan of The Jungle Book, even just a teeny tiny bit, try watching it again in 1080p. You'll be blown away and have a new love for the movie - guaranteed!",1391990400,4,1161,4.321100917431193
905331,5,6304500831,"I took my boys to see this film when it first came out and then I bought a record w/the songs on it and my boys, now have children of there own and they still talk about it.",1391990400,,173,3.5789473684210527
905332,5,6304500831,"Although Bambi, Dumbo and Lady and the Tramp are my favorite classic Disney titles, The Jungle Book holds a special place in my heart. My mother took me and my brother to see it on the big screen shortly before she died, and it was the only animated Disney film we saw together at the cinema. I remember that we were late and missed a few minutes, so we watched the rest of the film, Treasure Island, and then sat through all of The Jungle Book again afterwards. I only asked to see the few minutes we had missed, but we couldn't bring ourselves to leave at that point.

I don't think I have seen the film since that day around 40 years ago, so I wondered whether my treasured memory would be ruined by seeing it again as an adult. I'm happy to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

Walt Disney's last major animated film is a feel-good story suitable for the whole family. The story is simple: Mowgli is a small child who is discovered by Bagheera the panther in the Indian Jungle. After giving the matter some thought, he decides that the local wolves would provide the best home for the boy. Ten years quickly pass during a narrated scene and we skip ahead to the current day. The wolves have heard that the tiger, Shere Khan, is back in the neighborhood. He hates humans and will likely seek out Mowgli to kill him. Don't worry, I promise that your children won't be frightened by the story.

Mowgli is befriended by a small elephant, and also has the help of Bagheera, who decides to deliver the boy to a village so that he can be among his own kind. Along the way they encounter Baloo the bear, who is the life and soul of the film. He's not too bright, but his heart is in the right place and it's easy to love him.

Like most Disney classics, the story contains plenty of songs. The most notable is Bare Necessities, sung by Baloo, and it was nominated for an Oscar. There are four other songs, including King of the Swingers, which is almost as much fun as Bare Necessities.

The 78-minute story seems to be over all too quickly, but you could always watch it twice as I did all those years ago. I could imagine small children loving the colors, the music, and the bright characters that populate the entire movie.

The Diamond Edition  Blu-ray boasts a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, as well as the original mono track, and 5.1 Dolby Digital versions in French, Spanish and Portuguese. The picture is free of dirt and debris and looks as clear as a watercolor painting could possibly look. Be aware that these hand-painted Disney classics do not have the depth of modern CGI images, but the story is strong enough to make you focus on what's happening in the foreground. I was very happy with the presentation.

As well as features from the Classic DVD, this latest version includes the following:

Music, Memories and Mowgli: A Conversation with Richard M. Sherman, Diane Disney Miller and Floyd Norman (9:42)
Alternate Ending - Mowgli and the Hunter (unfinished animation in storyboard form) (8:46)
I Wan'na Be Like You: Hanging Out at Disney's Magic Kingdom (18:25)
Bear-e-oke (5 songs)
@disneyanimation: Sparking Creativity (9:14)

The package comes with an embossed slip cover and a DVD.

For any Disney fan who hasn't seen The Jungle Book, the Blu-ray is a great way to experience it for the first time. I would also recommend it as an upgrade for owners of the DVD.

In the movie they remain adversaries.  Also, Baloo is not the buffoon in the stories that he is portrayed to be in the movie.  The stories are beautiful allegories.  I wonder how Kipling would have felt about the movie.  It's great fun, but it probably does not reflect his intentions in writing the stories.",1390089600,,485,4.7023809523809526

One would expect this to have a detrimental effect but it all works in the movie's favor. It's basically a string of sketches and set pieces cobbled around a loose narrative, though it flies by quickly, especially when Baloo is on the screen.

Mowgli is a man-cub abandoned in the jungles of India and raised by wolves when Bagheera, a concerned panther, steps in and rescues him. Around 10 years later Bagheera tries to take him back to the man village but they are sidetracked by a variety of animals including Kaa, the snake, and lovable, floppy-armed King Louie, an orangutan who wants the secret of fire.

Much of the movie has a late-60s jazz theme which keeps it moving and jiving. The jungle animation, making great use of multi-plane cameras, is absolutely gorgeous, and makes every scene a joy to look at, even during some of the lulls (anything with the Elephants).

It's easy to see why it has become a classic as the characters are brilliant. Baloo and Co. came back in TaleSpin 23 years later and secured their status among the most popular Disney characters.

The Blu-ray looks absolutely gor-gee-ous in 1.75:1 1080p. You won't believe your eyes at how bright and colorful this 46-year-old animation looks. It's flawless. The sound is in very good DTS HD-MA 7.1 with lots of spacious effects and surrounds. Extras are fair, but hardly extensive.",1378944000,,1853,5.981132075471698

906443,4,6304500831,"Disney Studios 19th full length animated feature film from the Disney studios. The Jungle Book breathed new life into the Disney animated films after the so-so Sword in the Stone. By this time Walt was busy with other projects and had little Time to spend overseeing the animated films. The new Xerography process while being a cost saving achievement did not make these newer films better in my opinion, in fact they just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to.

Fortunately, The Jungle Book is one of Disney's best from this time period and because of the luke warm reception of Sword in the Stone Walt had a lot more to do with this film than that one. The Jungle Book has extremely memorable characters and has some of the best songs to grace any Disney film. The animation process has been fleshed out more and the new process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone. I can only imagine what this film would have looked like if it were done without the Xerography process. The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style. The rougher lines on the drawings being exposed just comes across like their unpolished. This process worked well with this film, Winnie the Pooh and 101 Dalmatians though, but after ending the traditional process with the fabulous looking Sleeping Beauty, (yes one scene used this process a sort of trial) these films looks very 2 dimensional and just don't seem to have the same magical look to them.

OK, now about the film and video releases. I have owned both DVD releases and now the Blu Ray release and they all have their good points and bad points. the first release has no bonus features, but is in the superior full screen format. While the restoration isn't as impressive as the newer release, it looks very good and actually helps to soften the rough lines in the animation. The newer release has been restored and looks great, but the widescreen presentation is cramped chopping off heads and feet in some scenes. Also the rough lines are more exaggerated. The EASY solution (Disney I'm talking to YOU!) would have been to include BOTH formats.

*****BLU RAY UPDATE******

The new Blu Ray release looks fabulous, but it does not include the full screen version of the film.
This is disappointing news for purist.

******END OF UPDATE*****

If I had to choose one edition I would keep my Limited issue DVD as the Full Screen Film is really what's important here. I would like to see it sparkle like the new edition, but I prefer the presentation in full screen rather than widescreen. It was shown both ways in theaters so why not offer both? The film is short enough and the extras don't take up that much space. I'll keep Blu Ray and the Limited editions as the film really does look great in HD dispite this flaw.",1378339200,8,2816,4.599601593625498

906633,5,6304500831,"One of those timeless tales, and one of Disney's finest hours, `The Jungle Book' is one of the best examples of the Disney canon that is NOT centered on a princess.  There is nothing wrong with princesses in my book (I've got two of them) but there is something special about a family film that reaches both genders in a way that isn't centered on love interests and royalty.  Teaching valuable lessons with a humble setting is what `The Jungle Book' is all about, and this dazzling 1967 film is top notch, for sure.

The film tells that familiar tale of young Mowgli, a young boy raised by animals and segregated from civilization.  Threatened by the evil Shere Khan (a tiger), Mowgli's friends Baloo and Bagheera try and convince him to leave the jungle and join a nearby village.  Baloo, the boisterous and lovable bear, takes a stab at convincing the young boy to leave, but the fun they have makes the decision all the harder for the young boy, and Baloo.

The film is one great moment after the other, and is filled to the brim with memorable songs and sequences, characters and sentimental life lessons that make the enjoyment factor VERY high with this one.  In fact, as an adult one can really take in this film and appreciate it on another level.  The themes of friendship and loyalty are strong here, and the bond that forms between Mowgli and Baloo is something special, and something that all ages will feel connected to.

With splendid animation and songs that will remain with you year after year after year, `The Jungle Book' is a swinging good time to be had for the whole family.",1377561600,,1597,4.575438596491228

Walt Disney adapted the story for the screen play and added some of the best songs ever written for film and utilized some of the greatest talent for narration, voice-overs, music, scripting, animation, and character design.  While Disney has put out many movies over the decades since Walt began his timeless journey, and many films became very popular in their day, The Jungle Book will stand as one of the all time greats along with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Mary Poppins, 101 Dalmatians, Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan and Cinderella to name a few.

907175,5,6304500831,"Disney stands for so many things and if you want to be cynical about them there is plenty of opportunity. For me I look to the things they've done the best and ""Jungle Book"" is one of the very best.

The characters are all well defined visually and the voices match the look perfectly. The songs are not just memorable they are almost necessary for a well rounded childhood.

No matter your age there will be someone here that you identify with. (I'd like it if I were Shere Khan, but I'm probably a little more King Louie) This is a fast paced, jazzy and fairly hip (for it's time) feature. It was one of the few that I never minded the kids saying, ""More! Again!""

The extras are fine, but I rarely judge a DVD release by the extras. In this case I was very happy with restored brilliance of color and sound. It looks just great on my Sony TV.

The kids I used to watch it with are now Sergeants in the army and computer techs for Microsoft, but I still watched it anyway. I remembered every word to every song and it all made me feel happy.

That is what Disney does best.",1372377600,,1075,4.173913043478261

My older brother took me to the theater to see it, must have been about 7 or 8 (I'm 51 now). The character that still stands out is the snake, with those hypnotizing eyes. He wasn't scary, but made me a little nervous when he turned those eyes on, and my brother noticed it. So he told a friend of his about it. He had what some call ""cat eyes"", ( a Black person with light colored eyes like blue, green, hazel etc). Well his friend was dark skinned with light grey eyes, and after he heard how I reacted to the snake in the cartoon, he would tease me by glaring at me with his big grey eyes. But it was all in fun, I wasn't ""traumatized"" or anything. Back then that's how older brothers and sisters played with and taunted one another. The orangutang is another favorite character - great movie for the kids overall.",1360368000,,907,4.218390804597701

What I like about this as an adult is the story of how creatures band together to protect a child very different from themselves.  It doesnt matter where you live, look like or believe.  All that does matter is knowing the differences in us all should not stand in the way of protecting another being, in this case Mowgli, a little boy.

908649,4,6304500831,"After falling completely off the wagon, as Walt Disney stepped down largely from the animated films at the end of the 1950's, this is, I would say, the greatest accomplishment of the lost Disney era (1960-1980). After Walt retired from this position, the individuals who came in his place were more concerned with saving money, recycling animation and doing everything cheap and quick (pshh, typical suits).

This was NOT the motto of Walt Disney, which is why under his wing the best animation the world has ever seen was produced. Unfortunately by the time this film came out W.D. had succumbed to lung cancer, so he was never able to see the final cut of the film. Although this was during the period of cheap animation, it's obvious when the animation is this scratchy and unclean, the story was good, the songs were great catchy jazzy tunes, voice acting was on par contributing to the overall saving of the movie. Now every Disney movie in the world has their own fan base, there are movies lots of people love and movies not as many people love, but every Disney film is loved for one reason or another.

The movies were also being much less produced then they had previously been, there were as many Disney films in the 1950's as there was from 1960 to the beginning of the new Disney Renaissance (1984-1994). Because of the quality of the films and reception after creating such great and seminal films as Cinderella how they could go to make hardly mediocre movies like The Aristocats?",1356393600,,1495,4.680608365019012

The music is wild, especially ""I Wanna Be Like You.""  I really like how this is a ""babysitter"" kind of movie where Bagheera the cranky panther must watch over a stubborn man cub like Mowgli, and Baloo doesn't seem to help him. The funniest moment between Baloo and Bagheera is when Bagheera gives a speech for Baloo who then takes it proudly, and makes Bagheera feel duped. Also, Shere Khan is a great villain, especially because he's a tiger. He's sophisticated, gentlemanly, but evil and deadly at the same time. Kaa is great too. He may not be the main villain or Shere Khan's henchman, but with all the popularity around him, he might as well be. Mowgli is remininscing of a protagonist with a difficult story; stubborn and rude but still a fun boy. King Louie's character is confusing for me. He kidnaps Mowgli, yet he is used for the fun bright side stuff of this movie? Oh well. Personally, I still really enjoy this.

Oh, well, nobody asked for 100% authenticity. And how did the man cub learn to speak English? No more absurd than the rest of the animals in the jungle speaking English, I suppose.

Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman) is an adorable young man, maybe 11 years old and rail thin, when the wolf pack that raised him from a baby ""man cub"" decides he has to be taken to the man village because Shere Khan the Tiger (George Sanders) is around, and he hates humans. He would surely destroy the man cub and anyone who tried to protect him. So Bagheera the Panther (Sebastian Cabot) volunteers to take him to the man village.

Mowgli doesn't want to go, he wants to stay in the jungle, even after Kaa the Snake (Sterling Holloway) hypnotizes him and the monkeys kidnap him. It turns out King Louie of the Apes (Louis Prima) wants Mowgli to teach him how to be a human. Specifically, he wants fire, but Mowgli doesn't know how to make fire, so that doesn't work out so well.

There is also a brigade of elephants led by Col Hathi, who will tell anyone at the drop of a branch about how he won the Victoria Cross. The colonial's adorable little son makes friends with Mowgli, which turns out to be important later on.

It's a fun story, but I won't swear it bears much resemblance to the original Jungle Book. Still, this is a good one to share with children and grandchildren.",1336608000,,1504,4.418772563176895

'Cut scene' to today... my baby daughter Sofia... Loves this movie too!  She requests 'Mowgli and Balloo' and the other characters.  After going through it once I use the 'Scene choose' function so we can watch various scenes.  It's a great intro to feature length stories, with many scenes you can watch by themselves.  The music is wonderful - a true classic of the Disney Animation genre.  I've seen nothing of recent vintage that remotely compares.  I also use Fantasia.

As a teacher I recommend these movies - they are wonderful.  But as a Dad - what can be better than watching Baloo sing 'The Bear Necessities' - with your kid in your lap! Answer: Nothing!

It ends with a depiction of a traditional culture - no worries, my daughter will be a modern person.

Also - the voices are amazing.  The Classic actor George Sanders plays the evil Shere Kahn.. Sebastian Cabot as Bagheera.... and Sterling Holloway is Kaa - the same voice that plays Winnie the Pooh, but here he's the cunning python.  My daughter always requests his scene first.  And the scene with Louie Prima singing the part of King Louie is beyond price.

THE JUNGLE BOOK was the last movie that Walt Disney directly oversaw. The finished picture in no way resembles Rudyard Kipling's original story, as Disney felt this was too dark for a cartoon. With top notch songs like ""The Bear Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You,"" talented performers and animation that was part Xerox, part hand drawn, ""The Jungle Book"" is a fitting career closer from the greatest name in family motion picture entertainment, Walt Disney.

However, after having re-read Kipling's classic, I can not say that this film is true to the original story.  The characters, most notably Baloo, the elephant army, and Kaa, have lost their nobility, and have come off as buffoonish.  Then, too, there is no talk of ""the laws of the jungle,"" which was so important to the original story.  Finally, Mowgli's original conflict is diminished.  In the Kipling stories, Mowgli returns to the man-village because the wolf-pack, led by outsider Shere Khan, has turned on him.  It's a cute movie, but in the end, it won't be joining my collection.",1304121600,2,706,4.793388429752066

909507,5,6304500831,"The Jungle Book is one hour and one hour and eighteen minutes and was released in theaters on October 18, 1967. This would be the last movie that Walt Disney personally oversaw. Basically the movie tells the story about a boy, Mowgli, who is raised by wolves in the jungles of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is ten years later and the tribe of wolves feels that the man cub must be sent to the human village because Shere Khan, a tiger, has return and they feel that they cannot protect the boy. Bagheera, a black leopard, offers to take the boy cub to the man village and that where the adventure begins. Mowgli does not want to live in the man village and wants to stay in the jungle.

Bagheera tries to explain to Mowgli, but he does not listen. Mowgli finds several different animals who would like to get closer to him for different reasons. Mowgli first meet Kaa, a giant Indian Python, and Kaa wants nothing more then to eat the child. Kaa fails in the two attempts when he is with the boy. Next he is met by Baloo, a sloth bear, and Baloo is a care free, fun loving bear who lives one day at a time. Baloo immediately takes a liking to Mowgli and wants to raise him a bear also. Later on in the movie Bagheera informs Baloo the truth as to why he can't raise him because of Shere Khan. While Mowgli and Baloo are enjoying life, Mowgli is kidnapped by a group of orangutans and is brought back to their leader - King Louie. King Louie wants the boy cub to teach on how to acquire the red flower (fire). King Louie plans are crushed when Baloo and Bagheera comes to rescue Mowgli. It is about ' into the movie that the main villain appears - Shere Khan. Shere Khan wants to kill the boy because he hates man and that includes women also. I will not go into how the story ends because of the criticism I have gotten in the past, but I will tell you that the movie had no ended and it was Walt Disney himself that came up with the ended himself.

The movie version of the Jungle Book differs greatly from the book version. In the book version there is no King Louie no vultures and the only resemblance to the book is the names used in the movie. Walt thought the book was too dark for children and instructed his animation department not to read the book. The Jungle Book was nominate for an Academy Award in 1967 for Best Song, The Bare Necessities, but lost out to Doctor Dolittle for Talk to the Animals. Gregory Peck tried to get the movie nominated and win for the Best Picture category, but the members of the Academy of Motion Pictures and Science felt that animation films did not belong in that category. It would not be until 1992 when Beauty and the Beast would be nominated for an Academy in the Best Picture category. The Jungle Book is a delightful movie for all ages and gets an AAAAA+++++.

909511,5,6304500831,"Reading other reviewers complaints about screen ratio it appears to me that no one appreciates the philosophy of ""bare necessities."" I guess I do though, because it doesnt bother me it wasn't released in widescreen, but still looks like an updated version of the VHS copy, which I had. So does Cinderella, play the same way, sooooo, so what. I'll say this one thing, Sleeping Beauty is presented in widescreen ratio, and I still use the ZOOM in my remote to bring the picture back to full screen. It seems I would rather be close to the characters, and the action, rather than appreciate the panoramic look. I think the portable dvd players, however, do manage to play with the panoramic look because of formatting. At any rate, these recent platinum Disney dvd issues are grand with multiple discs, extras, and places to choose besides movie. The package cover is 3D like and very attractive, almost difficult to throw away to keep just the discs on file, which I ususally do to most movies to downsize storage, but I have a special dvd rack for these wonderful Disney releases, and have no complaints about formats whatsoever.  There are books available on the art of Disney that present in printed form the final looks of most Disney animated films if one really needs to see the artwork firsthand.
Great extra of the animals that were left out, and how Walt hated the comedy bit profiled to one animal that was deleted by his account.",1298505600,,1438,4.683794466403162

It's just how I remember it, beautifully animated, toe tapping music, great characterisations (although this was less of a concern when I was 5!) and a good story to boot. Modern animations, although impressive, seem too polished sometimes and I love in this film how you can see the pen strokes on the screen and get a feel that there was a person behind the artwork. The songs in this film are some of Disney's most famous and rightly so, 'Bare Necessities' 'King of the Swingers', even the 'elephant parade', they really are that good . I tend to find Disney films too saccharine sweet, but The Jungle Book is just the right balance of cuteness and story. Overall a great film from the Disney back catalogue and one not to be missed.

909817,4,6304500831,"Jungle Book, the movie, is radically different from the classic Rudyard Kipling novel but I tend to be more forgiving if a movie preserves the spirit of the book but in this case it absolutely doesn't. The characters are completely different and remain the same only in name and species. In particular the literary Baloo is nothing like the singing slacker from the movie. One might note that at the beginning it states that the movie was `inspired' by Kipling's Jungle Book and I assume by this it means that Disney was inspired to write a completely new story. The real question is whether or not the Jungle Book, standing on its own, is a quality animated movie. Of course it is, it's Disney but that doesn't mean it's spectacular. The Jungle Book is a rather small tale that takes place over the course of one or two days as Mowgli is taken by Bagheera and Baloo to live in the man village.

There are a few issues with the movie that can be a bit cringe worthy. The monkeys who kidnap Mowgli, including King Louis, are all portrayed as stereotypical blacks. Now one might argue that the movie does take place in Africa except it doesn't. The Jungle Book takes place in India which is in Asia. Why aren't the monkeys portrayed as stereotypical Indians? There is a tremendous amount of Disneyfication. In the book Mowgli grows to loath the humans for their treatment of his parents and uses elephants to raze the village to the ground. This is, shall we say, NOT the ending Disney went with. In the book Mowgli kills Shere Khan and skins him rather than having him scamper off with his tail on fire.

The animation is old fashioned yeoman type work but in this case that is a big compliment. There is no corner cutting here as each characters is drawn alive and active rather than static with moving mouths as cheaper animation studios will do. The character movement is very believable and I'm sure a ton of rotoscoping was done which I don't consider cheating in the least. Disney was well known for doing meticulous research on animal movement and Shere Kahn looks great as he stalks Mowgli. The music is very catchy including the python Kaa's `Trust in Me' and Baloo's wonderful `Bear Necessities'. Overall the animation is probably average or below average for a Disney movie (which are always above average for animation in general). It's very dark and often bland.

So what you get is a dramatically watered down story that kinds of leaves it a bit dull. It's just a one (or perhaps two) day journey to the man village and not a whole heckuva lot happens. There are segments where Mowgli meets a group of elephants and another with some buzzards imitating the Beatles (a rather unfortunate attempt to tap into some pop culture circa 1967). Both of these segments added nothing to the larger story which is paper thin. I like the concept behind The Jungle Book and there are great elements but if I were to start a collection of Disney movies The Jungle Book would be low on my list of movies to own.",1278892800,2,3009,4.568518518518519

The movie was enjoyable to watch.  The segments on the making of the film reveal why it was so successful, why I enjoyed it so much when I was a kid.

There is only one complaint I have, and that regards the packaging.  You realize early on that the primary storyteller, a key character, was Bagheera the panther, and he has been my favorite Disney character.  Yet he is not at all on the packaging of the film, either on the front or on the back.

One Disney film gives you the idea that all of Disney's animated films are classics, and I strongly disagree.  However, this one definitely is a classic.

910211,4,6304500831,"If there is some kind of contest on for the Walt Disney movie which least resembles the supposed source material, ""The Jungle Book"" must be the clear winner. It bears only the lightest and most coincidental resemblance to Rudyard Kiplings's cycle of stories about a little boy raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. Only the setting and the names of characters are preserved. That said, ""The Jungle Book"" deserves to be considered on its' own terms as a classically animated Disney feature,  the very last to have been blessed by the hand of Walt himself. The plot is as thin as a wisp; the journey of the boy Mowgli to the village of his own kind, interspersed with some good-natured musical numbers, and helped or hindered by a variety of genial animals, and not terribly threatening villains.

It is a curious jumble, to watch with eyes accustomed to more recent animated features like ""Shrek"" and ""Toy Story"". Without exception the backgrounds are beautifully rendered, densely detailed, almost painterly. The animal characters were fully-fleshed, and with the exception of Kaaa, the python, seemed to move and flex like their real counterparts; especially King Louie the baboon, Bagheera the panther and Sher Khan the tiger. The last two seemed especially slinky; it would be nice to know if the artists responsible for their rendering had cats. King Louie is hilarious, and so are the four vultures - very obviously patterned after the Beatles.  In contrast, the rendering of Mowgli the boy and ostensible hero, looks like a bland and sketchily rendered cut-out. It almost seems as if the artists were far more interested in the animals.

The extra features included are generous; this is veritably the platinum standard for a DVD classic. It is on  two discs; necessary to contain the complete movie and commentary. There is also a nearly hour-long feature about how the movie was developed, along with several shorter features. One of the bonus features is a look at a character ""Rocky the Rhino"" who was eventually omitted - rather a pity actually, since Rocky  would have been voiced by the man who did ""Crazy Guggenheim"". There are also complete recordings of songs which were dropped from the final version, and probably a good call. There are also generous picture galleries of the characters and of the background art, which was purely my favorite, and a series of games. The actual movie itself takes barely more than an hour itself, but the extras will keep an audience amused for days.",1243900800,2,2502,4.9170616113744074

Disney twisted the story to make Mowgli naive and helpless.  The only moment in the movie that (almost) rings true is Mowgli's attraction to the human girl at the end -- but in the novel, this only happens when Mowgli becomes a man.  In the book Mowgli is driven back to man by traitorous members of the wolf pack, but returns to the jungle after killing Shere Khan and being rejected by his fellow humans.

910506,4,6304500831,"Well, yes, that's true.  This is one of the great classics ever produced.  I already own the original version in full frame on DVD.  The reason that I gave this 4 stars is simply because they cropped the movie from top and bottom to make it widescreen.  It's not true that you won't see the characters heads.  Yes, you lose a little from the picture, but then so you do if you play the full frame version on a widescreen TV and you set the TV to ""widezoom"" instead of 16:9, because if you set the TV to 16:9 you will see everything ""flat"".  So you need to set it to a more normal aspect ratio, which in the Sony case it's called ""widezoom"", Philips has the ""Zoom 16:9"" and ""Zoom 14:9"", others have other names for that setting.  When you watch the movie like that, in order to fill the entire screen, you will lose from top and bottom on a full frame movie.
However, with this movie, they didn't simply just cut the movie from top and bottom.  They did an entire re-working of the film, where they take it frame by frame and they cut from top and bottom where there's unimportant stuff on the screen.  In other words, if you have a scene where the character is shown more on the top of the screen, and you have a rock or grass, or something else on the bottom, then they will cut only from the bottom enough so that it fits on a widescreen frame.  In other scenes, they will cut accordingly, so that you won't lose essential stuff that must be seen.
Therefore, if you're trying to make a decision whether or not you should replace your original, full-frame DVD of this movie with this new widescreen version, I guess it all comes down to how much of a movie buff you are.  If you really really love a classic, an original, then you will stick to the original full frame if you already have it.  If you just want to own a copy of this movie, and you own a widescreen TV and you adore new technology, then I suggest that you buy this new version.  They made it to fit just that profile.
Me - I already own the original full-frame DVD.  I've watched it on my widescreen TV and it looks fine.

Of course, the story is loosely based on Rudyard Kipling's work, but entrancing to all.

910798,5,6304500831,"I hadn't seen this movie from beginning to end since I was 4 or 5, so I didn't remember it too well. When I finally got the DVD for Christmas and watched it, I loved every minute of it. Jungle Book has lost none of its charm over the past 40 years. From the very beginning, when we see Bagheera rescuing the abandoned ""man-cub,"" Mowgli and entrusting him to the wolf pack, to Mowgli's journey through the jungle to the man village, it's a pure delight. Shere Khan, who hates man, has returned to the jungle to find young  Mowgli and kill him. The wolf pack hears about this and decides it's too dangerous to keep him around any longer, and have Bagheera escort him to the man village to safety. Of course, Mowgli does not want to leave the jungle, and tries to get away from Bagheera. He meets Baloo the bear, Kaa the python, and the scat-singing King Louie (voiced by the legendary Louie Prima). This can more than hold its own against modern classics such as ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin,"" and ""Lion King."" Highly recommended for kids of all ages!",1199577600,,1053,4.427835051546392

910800,3,6304500831,"I don't have kids yet! Someday, but they're always be must haves for the kiddies. Of course, by that point, they're probably be newer, better editions out!

I didn't really remember much about this movie, apart from the songs. But as soon as it started, it all came flooding back. It was never my favourite Disney movie, and it was also Walt Disney's last movie, before he died. There are also a few problems with this movie - a couple of scenes are directly lifted from previous films (the scene where Mowgli is met by his 'family' is the same as the scene from Sword In The Stone), Phil Harris who did the voice of Baloo went on to voice the Little John character in Robin Hood, and the snake is the same in this film as in Robin Hood again. It feels almost lazy at some points, but they're using the same artists, so it does feel quite familiar at some points.

Why was Jungle Book never my favourite Disney movie? I'm not quite sure about that one, it just never appealed to me as much as some of the others. I never really enjoyed the book either.

I got the UK edition of the DVD, which comes with the 2 disc DVD, and also a book. It's just a plain picture book, with key scenes from the movie, which is quite a cute addition.

Disney are doing well with these reissues of old movies, even if the extras are always aimed at the kids - what about adults reliving their childhood? - but they're not coming out fast enough! I missed out on Beauty & The Beast and Aladdin first time round, can't wait to hear about those!",1199232000,,1523,4.241379310344827

I guess over the past years we've all been spoiled by the sophisticated computer-generated animation on more recent movies, and this movie doesn't have that new rich detail.

910913,1,6304500831,"While the Jungle Book remain one of my Disney favourites from my childhood days, watching this cropped version virtually killed all the magic that was in the movie. I was so distracted by all the cropped heads and feet there was no way I could concentrate on the plot. So much of the background and scenery was lost that it just threw the scenes off balance. Why even call this a platinum edition when the original 1.37.1 aspect ration was not preserved? Isn't that what a platinum edition is all about? Ever see a cropped Picasso or Van Gogh? This is the worst Disney release to date and I would hesitate buying another Disney release if they are all going to turn out this way. A total waste of money. Disney should refund or offer to replace all discs from dissatisfied customers.",1198454400,40,783,4.52112676056338

911021,5,6304500831,"Disney's latest addition to its platinum DVD series is its 1967 classic, ""The Jungle Book"". Many reviewers have complained about the widescreen transfer of the film for this new DVD - I'm not. Having both the platinum release and the original limited issue '99 disc, the sound and picture quality of the new edition towers over its imperfections. A worthy addition to the platinum DVD collection.",1197936000,,396,5.015151515151516
911022,5,6304500831,"Walt Disney's animated classic, ""The Jungle Book,"" gets the platinum treatment on its latest appearance on DVD.  This wonderful tale, fully restored with vibrant colors and excellent audio, tells the story of Mowgli, a man-cub, and his black panther father-figure, Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot), as the latter attempts to get the boy back to the man-village where he belongs before the wicked and mighty tiger, Shere Khan (George Sanders), can get his claws into him.  Along the way they meet up with the one and only jungle VIP, King Louie (wonderfully voiced by Louis Prima), Kaa the python (Sterling Holloway), everybody's favorite bear, Baloo (Phil Harris) and some wisecracking vultures.

This platinum edition features an excellent digital restoration, a number of excellent documentaries, games, a visit with ""Rocky the Rhino,"" who found his way to the cutting room floor, and plenty of other extras.  There's also a passable Jonas Brothers cover of Louis Prima's ""I Wan'na Be Like You"" that's sure to attract the attention of pre-teen girls the world over.

This particular DVD is also a Disney Movie Rewards disc, meaning that you can gain points for purchasing it.

While some squabble over the aspect ratio of the film, I think that the story, music, and characters are far too valuable to pass up because of this.  If you don't own ""The Jungle Book"" and consider yourself a Disney fan, make sure you buy this disc before Disney takes it away again.

Highly recommended.",1197417600,,1478,5.028688524590164

Three stars says you like the movie, but at the same time your not in love with it. That explains my position perfectly. This is a charming movie that I thoroughly enjoyed as a child, and by all means it is superior to most films that are made for children today. My main issue is that I don't feel it is as strong as other classic movies from the Disney vault. It just doesn't compare to a Snow White, Peter Pan, Bambi, Lady And The Tramp, or Mary Poppins. It is good to note that this is a solid childrens film that the whole family can enjoy. However, I always hold Disney films under a more critical lense. Disney themselves set the standard for childrens films, so they should be judged by the standards they set forth. Jungle Book is a solid movie I am proud to own.

911389,5,6304500831,"Left in the jungle as a baby, raised by wolves, befriended by a panther and a bear, Mowgli's life is now threatened by the return of Shere Khan, the tiger, and king of the jungle. Don't worry; this movie has very little violence for it is a classic story based off of Rudyard Kipling's story about a boy who is raised by wolves.
  Mowgli's animal family refers to him as the ""man cub"" and he is happy living in the jungles of India, but once the tiger Shere Khan finds out he is there, he will no longer be safe. Bagheera, the wise old panther, decides to take Mowgli to the nearest man village, even though the boy doesn't want to leave. Throughout their journey, they encounter Kaa, a hypnotic snake, and an army of elephants, and Baloo the bear, who is widely popular for his ""Bare Necessities"" song. Mowgli is tempted by Baloo's lovable, laid-back way of life, but when Mowgli decides he likes being a bear and the two ditch Bagheera, the pair run into trouble.
Some crazy orangutans kidnap Mowgli and take him to their king, Louis Prima, who then tempts him with an offer he can't refuse. Shere Khan finds out there is a ""man cub"" in his jungle and is hot on his trail. Somehow, Baloo and Bagheera find a way to team up to protect the boy.
  Once the unlikely duo rescue Mowgli from the orangutans, Baloo angers him by mentioning they must take him to a man village and he runs off. He eventually encounters the barbershop singer group made up of vultures and they cheer him up. Danger strikes when Shere Khan appears and attempts to capture Mowgli. Baloo comes to his rescue by distracting the tiger so he can get away, but the tiger attacks Baloo and knocks him unconscious. Bagheera then ties a branch engulfed with fire to the tigers tail and he runs off.
  Once Shere Khan is defeated in the film and Baloo recovers, the trio treks on and only by chance does Mowgli leave the jungle. At the bittersweet ending, Mowgli is lured by his human instincts when he sees a girl for the first time and follows her into the village.
The Jungle Book is filled with songs you can't help but sing along to and with jungle animals you can't help but fall in love with, even Shere Khan's voice is charming. Enjoyed by children and adults alike, this charming film is Disney's 17th animated feature and the last film Walt supervised before his death.
  I enjoy this movie every time I watch it, especially now because it reminds me how much I loved it when I was a kid. Every character is appealing to viewers in some way because they are all so diverse and in it's own way, the film does teach children even though it wasn't necessarily created for educational purposes. Children can learn that even if someone may look or act differently from them, they can still get along. By the end of the movie, Bagheera manages to loosen up enough to give in to Baloo's care-free way of life. They can also learn about teamwork through Baloo and Bagheera and that it's not okay to kill someone even if you don't like them.
  I would certainly recommend this film to children, parents and even teachers. Teachers may find the new edition very useful for educational purposes because it is interactive. Parents and children may also find the interactive aspect a plus because kids can then interact with their favorite characters through games. The 40th Anniversary Platinum Edition just came out this fall, with many special features such as music videos, deleted scenes and songs, long lost characters, backstage features, games, and more.",1194739200,,3524,4.561708860759493

I'll watch this over and over again it's so good.",1194652800,,377,4.920634920634921
911393,5,6304500831,"The Jungle Book is a significant film for several reasons. First, it was the last film that Walt Disney himself was involved in directly. Walt had not been happy with some of the company's recent efforts such as ""Sword in the Stone"" and he took a more hands-on role with Jungle Book. Unfortunately, Disney would not see the fruits of his efforts. He passed away in December 1966, about seven months before the film was released. Still, Disney's handprints are all over the film. Initially conceived as a darker, more dramatic film, and more influenced by Rudyard Kipling's original story, Disney tossed out the idea, along with the original director. The result was the last great Disney animated film before the company was rejuvenated in the 1990's with films like ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"". By anyone's account, their films of the 70's and 80's were lacking the passion of earlier efforts.

Yet another significant difference in this movie was the use of major Hollywood talent to supply the voices for most of the characters. This is common practice today but was not the norm in the 1960's. And you probably could not have selected a more eclectic group of actors. At one of the spectrum you have stately British actors Sebastion Cabot as Bagheera the Panther and George Sanders (one of Hollywood's great voices) as the sinister tiger Shere Khan. At the polar opposite was Comedian/actor /bandleader Phil Harris and his southern drawl playing happy-go-lucky bear Baloo, along with Jazz bandleader and swing singer Louis Prima as the voice of orangutan King Louis. Additional voices were provided by Sterling Holloway as Kaa the snake. Holloway is better known for providing the voice of another Disney character, Winnie the Pooh. Ron Howard's brother, Clint, voiced baby elephant Junior. One other footnote, the singing voice of Shere Khan was performed by Thurl Ravenscroft who was the voice of Tony the Tiger, as well as the singer of the ""Grinch"" song.

The story oh Jungle Book is simple. Little boy Mowgli was found in the jungle and raised by wolves. But when the wolves find out that the evil Shere Khan is returning to the jungle, they enlist the aid of Bagheera and Baloo to escort Mowgli back to the man village. The only problem is that Mowgli doesn't want to go. He's grown up in the jungle and the animals are his friends and only family. Complicating masters is not one, but three villains. Besides Shere Khan, Kaa and King Louie all want Mowgli for their own reasons. Bagheera and Baloo have to keep him safe from the villains and convince him that the man village is the best place for him.

Jungle book contains two of the best songs in Disney history, ""The Bare Necessities"" and the swinging `I Wanna be Like You"". These are timeless songs which were both Oscar-nominated. Not to be forgotten is the menacing and hypnotic ""Trust in Me"" sung by Kaa to Mowgli as he prepares to make a meal of him. It's a fantastic production and the animation is simply gorgeous. Watch the scene when Mowgli is walking by himself through the jungle, kicking at the ground. The fluidity of movement is perfect, and watch how his hair blows in the gentle breeze. 3D animation may be the rage today but there's nothing like outstanding 2D animation.

This is the latest Disney classic to get the platinum treatment and while it doesn't have as many special features as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it's still a solid lineup of extras. The making of documentary runs about 45 minutes and includes current and vintage interviews with many of the writers, animators, actors, and the composers who were involved in the project. This takes you through the complete process and there's great footage of Prima and his band dancing about as they perform ""I Wanna Be Like you"". In ""Mowgli's Return to the Jungle"", Bruce Reitherman, the voice of Mowgli, shares his memories of making the film and how the experiences influenced his current job as a wildlife filmmaker. Reitherman's father, Wolfgang, was the film's director.

There's an interesting short featurette on a lost character from the film. The near-sighted, short-tempered rhinoceros named Rocky is brought to the screen using original storyboards and original voice recordings by Frank Fontaine. In addition there's a couple of other featurettes, audio commentary, sill gallery, music videos, and games. The word classic is over used today but it definitely applies to The Jungle Book. Forty years later this is still a wonderful film for the whole family.

Did I ever see this movie when I was young?  It is so hard to know with these Disney movies as I watch them with my daughter.  Some of the songs seem familiar, but is it from watching the movie?  We only got to see them every couple years or so on the Sunday night movie.

This movie, which was released the same year I was born, is much more fresh and young than I am.  First- another Disney remastering where the film is absolutely flawless, crisp, and colorful.  The soundtrack is good as well.

As for the film and story and music, this is one of the best from Disney.  Watching Baloo dance and sing the Bare Necessities is so enjoyable for adults and kids.  When Baloo puts on his ""disguise"" at the ruins and starts to dance with King Louie, he steals the show.

All the songs are great, but my favorite is King Louie's ""I Wanna Be Like You"".  If there is one flaw with the whole DVD, it is the music video for that song by a youngish rock band, and it is a bad version.  Louis Prima's original is so good, perhaps nobody could top it, but this isn't even close.  Disney has done much better with some of the extra music videos on the other DVDs.

One special touch of all these Disney movies, is compeletely unintentional, is ""spotting"" or hearing the voice actors in the various roles in the various movies.  In this one, of course you have Sebastian Cabot, but the one I really love is Sterling Holloway as Kaa the boa.  Holloway a decade later would go on to be Winnie the Pooh and you can always hear him as Pooh, so to hear Pooh's voice come out of the evil Kaa, is just delightful.  (Holloway also was the stork in Dumbo 25 years earlier than Jungle Book).

Superbly voiced by Phil Harris, Baloo seems to be endowed with all the characteristics that made Walt Disney himself so beloved: he's charming, funny, warm, inventive, child-like and a helluva lot of fun to be around.  How poignant that he was pretty much the master animator's final creation.  The ""ridiculous"" being four mop-topped Liverpudlian vultures.  This embarrasingly misguided homage to the Beatles -- who sing a hackneyed barbershop quartet yet -- lowers ""The Jungle Book"" to a level it never rises above.  Too bad, as the film up until then has been a near-classic.  The animation is gorgeously detailed and colorful, the scoring by George Bruns mysterious and evocative and the songs clever and memorable.  I say ""near""-classic, as I find the elephants both boring and unneccesary, particularly when they set out to find the missing Mowgli and trudge themselves right out of the film, never to be seen again!  Is ""The Jungle Book"" worth having?  It's a Disney film, of course it is!

This film was a hit when I was a youngster and is one of my three favorite Disney animated movies.  [The others being- 101 Dalmations and Snow White].  All the voices fit the characters they are portraying.  Not like the animated flicks of today, with celebrities hitching to the voice wagon, just so they can tell their precocious offspring- ""Look daddy (or in some cases Grandpappy) is the voice of Fester the Fish!"" I especially like the voice of Shere Khan, provided by George Sanders.  Those great animators of yesteryear even made the Tiger look like Sanders.

With incredible voice talent of New Orleans' Phil Harris and Louie Prima, this movie is so jazzy and cool that you become addicted to their style of lingo and banter. Just like being in New Orleans French Quarter!
This two disk set is curiously missing the theatrical trailer(s) while they managed to put in an extraneous music video.  Who really cares about these young kids singing a Jungle Book updated (gasp) song.  I don't.

911874,5,6304500831,"""The Jungle Book"" needs no praise from me; it's a lot of fun, and about as ""hip"" as Disney got (at least without being embarrassing about it) until Pixar started figuring into the occasion.

But I'd like to say a few words about the extras. On paper, they look pretty skimpy -- especially for a two-disc release -- but in truth, they're pretty good. There's a full-length commentary (though unfortunately many of the principals aren't around to pitch in), and an hour or so of documentaries, and that's not even getting into the games and such, which I have no interest in investigating.

My only reservation about the extra material is that it could be a bit better edited -- several of the same anecdotes pop up as many as three times. But I found it interesting to hear (and see), for instance, how Louis Prima and his band performed ""I Wanna Be Like You"" to inspire the Disney artists (though the band was eventually replaced on the soundtrack), and hear the complete earlier score supplied by Terry Gilkyson, which -- other than ""The Bare Necessities"" -- was dropped along with the original conception of the film.",1192320000,5,1119,4.675126903553299
911875,5,6304500831,"The Jungle Book tells the story of a boy named Mowgli who is raised by wolves in an Indian jungle.  He leads an idyllic life befriended by many animals until the day that Shere Khan, the tiger, returns to the area intent on killing the boy.  The animals decide to send Mowgli to the man-village where his people can protect him.  Bagheera the panther gets the job of escorting him, but Mowgli has no desire to leave the jungle.  In his desperation. Mowgli links up with Baloo the Bear and attempts learn the ""Bear Necessities.""  A good deal more happens, but I don't want to give away the whole plot.

Disney has made few movies that have maintained their popularity as well as The Jungle Book.  It is a true classic.  First, the voice talent is quite possibly the finest ever assembled for an animated film.  Younger audiences will not be familiar with names like George Sanders and Sebastian Cabot even though they were very well known in their day.  But the important thing is that every single voice is pitch perfect for the part.  The epitome of this is obviously Phil Harris who provided the booming voice of Baloo.  I must confess that Baloo is probably my favorite Disney character of all time and I can't conceive of anyone else bringing the easy charm and warmth that Harris just radiated with that incredible voice of his.

The characters are all interesting and likable.  The malicious Shere Khan comes across as incredibly suave with a wry wit that is quite funny at times.  Even relatively minor characters like Colonel Hathi and King Louie are memorable and enjoyable.  This is partly because of the excellent voice acting and partly because of the unusually sharp script.  The story moves along at a brisk pace and more than holds the interest of adults and children alike.  Mowgli seems to get in one mess after another and the jungle provides a great source of these situations.

The music is yet another high point.  The soundtrack features several tunes that are very catchy and fun.  Some are well remembered such as ""The Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You.""  But even less featured songs such as ""Colonel Hathi's March"" and ""That's What Friends Are For"" burn themselves quite pleasantly into your brain.

If The Jungle Book has a fault, it is in the animation.  The movie was made just as Disney started cutting major corners in their animation and it shows.  The character animations are definitely more sketchy and rough than you would see in a movie like Lady and the Tramp when they were more meticulous.  Fortunately, the character design was still flawless and the quality of art had not yet diminished to the extent that it would in the 1970s when the company's animation hit rock bottom.

My final verdict on The Jungle Book is that it is as entertaining an animated film as you're ever likely to see.  In many aspects of its production, it remains one of the true greats and I would recommend it to anyone of any age.  The story is interesting, the characters and voices are incredible, and the music is as catchy as any soundtrack you'll hear.  The art is a little rough but is not nearly bad enough to detract from the overall experience.",1192320000,3,3179,4.635062611806798
911876,5,6304500831,"What can I say...it's a Disney Classic. It's great the Disney finally chose to put it on DVD, it's a nice addition to our collection.",1192060800,,133,4.36
911877,4,6304500831,"I hate the word ""zany"" though since it implies to me a sense of craziness with no heart or anything of substance. But when you look at it, The Jungle Book was probably one of Disney's more optimistic and overly-joyful outings; from its music to its humor to its voice acting. But it also had, like a lot of Disney films had, a sense of something beyond surface-level that you could get out of it. While certain things about it feel unpolished, it's a good capper on Walt Disney's influential career and a good film on its own.

One day in the jungle, Bagheera the panther finds a small baby in the woods. Not having the heart to abandon it, he decides to leave it with a small wolf pack. Now 10, Mowgli wants to stay in the jungle and be like everyone else but when the feared Shere Khan the tiger is spotted with a loathesome opinion of man, Bagheera has to help Mowgli get to a man-village. But when free-spirited bear Baloo comes in befriending Mowgli and seductive snake Kaa wanting Mowgli for lunch, it becomes harder to get him safely to the village.

Probably best known as Disney's last film before he died in 1966, the Jungle Book is one of those kind of films where others have done better in certain areas yet the film pulls it off anyway. For one thing, the animation is not as impressive as Sleeping Beauty was, the villain doesn't have the presence and staying power like Captain Hook or Cruella Da Vil. And after many a viewings, I still never found the elephant herd likable or even entertaining on some way. As for the rest of the film, what it does have is fun music from the ever-popular ""Bare Necessities"" to the infectious ""I Wanna Be Like You"".

Make all the jokes you want about DI$NEY and their tendency to favor money and product over art, they're second to none when it comes down to getting the film look pristine and while the animation style looks a bit cruder (which started around 101 Dalmations and continued till the 80's), this is probably the best looking version of the film out there. We also get a making-of and a commentary but then again it's got that Disney tendency of putting in kid's games so it might not be stockful of meaningful info but at least you can say it's stocked.

Parts of me enjoy the Jungle Book but another half of me finds it the least likely candidate of the Platinum releases to get constant replaying but it's a fun movie anyway that kids will no doubt love.

By the way, for those interested, next is 101 Dalmations for Spring and apparently, Sleeping Beauty is being re-released this time next year for Blu-Ray.",1191974400,3,2577,4.451271186440678
911878,5,6304500831,"A majestic black panther named Bagheera comes across a human baby all alone in an Indian jungle. Concerned for the child's wellbeing, he delivers it to a family of wolves in the hopes that they will take him in as one of their own. They do, and the boy, Mowgli, grows up happily among the animals as a creature of the jungle. But when the ferocious, man-hating tiger Shere Khan returns to the area on a mission to kill the boy, Mowgli's animal friends must conspire to return him to the safety of the man-village from whence he came.

Bagheera and Mowgli set forth on the long journey to the village and encounter some of Disney's greatest characters along the way. The best one being, without a doubt, Baloo the bear, who immediately adopts Mowgli after the boy discovers the purpose of his excursion with Bagheera and refuses to continue. Mowgli is happy where he is, and Baloo is all set to teach his new man-cub how to be a bear and live off the bare necessities. However, with such dangers as Kaa the hypnotic python, King Louie the would-be pyromaniac orangutan and his monkey troupe, and of course the menacing, deadly Shere Khan lurking about in search of the boy, even the carefree Baloo will have to take into consideration what is best for the child.

Truly one of the finest Disney animated features of all-time, and possibly my favorite from Walt's day (though, that's a very tough call), ""The Jungle Book"" is a must have for anyone who loves Disney animation or just animation in general! This is still considered some of the finest character animation of all-time! And that's what ""The Jungle Book"" is all about, the characters! The plot is simple, no doubt about that. It's a road-trip through the jungle with survival being the key concern. There's more emotion and entertainment to it than you might think though, thanks to those outstanding character creations! This film has plenty of laughs and heart, and some of the best music you've ever heard (thanks to the Sherman Brothers, Terry Gilkyson, and George Bruns)! Wonderfully directed by Disney animation legend Wolfgang Reitherman, whose son Bruce was the voice of Mowgli, and guided by the master himself, Walt Disney, as the last animated feature he would personally oversee, ""The Jungle Book"" was deservedly an instant smash success! The virtually ""living"" animation and simple storytelling demonstrate Disney filmmaking at its best, and one of the songs (Bare Necessities) even earned an Academy Award Nomination! And for those who think casting big-name celebs in animated films detracts from the overall effect, it certainly didn't hurt this Disney Masterpiece! The cast roster includes such folks as Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, George Sanders, and even Clint Howard, among others! It was even intended to use the Beatles as the voices of the vultures, but I guess they felt they were bigger than Jungle Book. Oh well, I always preferred The Monkees myself! Though, this film features a different kind of monkey.

Without a doubt, if you own a DVD player, you should own this DVD, and ""The Jungle Book"" has never looked better! This newly restored version, presented here in a widescreen format that gives us less on the top and bottom (but more on the sides) than the old, bare-bones release, looks and sounds great and is loaded with extras spread out over 2-discs. Before I get to the extras though, I know everyone is concerned about the aspect ratio thing. Well, there seems to be debate over whether Disney should have gone the matted route. Some say the film was intended to be cropped into a widescreen version for its theatrical release, some argue that it was not. Clearly, Disney should have included both options in this set, but my best advice is to not throw your Limited Issue ""Jungle Book"" DVD out if this is a problem for you. I probably will hang on to mine. Of course, most of you probably don't have the L.I. DVD, but whether you do or not, don't hesitate to pick up this newer edition. The picture, matted as it is, looks amazing, and the extras are so great. Sure, there could have been more. Disney has somewhat slacked off on the Platinum Editions most of the time in comparison to the initial Snow White release, but there is still a lot of must have stuff for the Jungle Book fan!

In addition to the film itself, Disc One holds a wonderful audio commentary with Bruce Reitherman (Mowgli's voice and son of the film's director), composer Richard Sherman, and current Disney master animator and self-professed number one Jungle Book fan Andreas Deja. Archival recordings of animators who worked on the film are also played during the commentary, and it all adds up to one very informative and enjoyable, even touching experience. The first disc also includes the ""Music and More"" section, which holds your standard, cheezy Disney Channel teen update video, this one being the Jonas Brothers performing ""I Wanna Be Like You,"" and a set of three sing-along song selections from the film, as well as two other far more fascinating features. These are a group of audio selections of deleted songs from a very different version of the film that Walt felt was too dark for a Disney animated feature, and a deleted character/scene of a dim-witted rhino named Rocky put together in voiced storyboard format. The deleted scene is quite interesting to watch, especially with its more Beatle-esque version of ""That's What Friends Are For,"" but overall it's not something that you'll regret having been cut. The deleted songs, on the other hand, are a bit more substantial and bring to mind the much earlier, live-action ""Jungle Book"" film starring Sabu. Besides all that great stuff, there is a promo for the Disney Wildlife Worldwide Conservation Fund, and the disc is also enhanced with Disney Fast Play for the kiddies.

Disc Two features the bulk of the extras, of course, the main one being the expected ""Making-Of"" featurette, ""The Bare Necessities: The Making of The Jungle Book."" This is an excellent 46 and half (or so) minute featurette full of great interviews and with a really tear-jerking section that goes into Walt's death during the making of the film. It really is a captivating watch, and it can be viewed in sections if one chooses. Other featurettes include a first-rate comparison between Disney's version of the film and the original works of Rudyard Kipling, ""The Lure of the Jungle Book,"" in which we get to see modern animators reminisce about what ""The Jungle Book"" has meant to them and their careers, ""Mowgli's Return to the Wild,"" a featurette about Bruce Reitherman's current life as a nature filmmaker and his reflections on his father, and finally ""Frank and Ollie,"" which is not the feature-length documentary of the same title available on its own DVD, but rather a brief carry over from the Jungle Book laserdisc previously referred to as ""Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston Discuss Character Animation."" Besides the featurettes, there is one more group of extras that falls under the heading of ""The Man Village"" (as Disc Two is divided into two sections), and that is the Art Galleries. These are what you have come to expect from Disney Platinum releases and are all very appreciated by us Disney animation fanatics, of course. The other section of Disc Two falls under the heading of ""Jungle Fun,"" and, to be honest, it's mostly just for the kids, though I do like the Disneypedias. The bulk of the section is 4 games that can be played as one long game, but I had trouble playing them on my player (which probably has more to do with the player than the disc) and I wasn't too interested anyway. I'd rather have trivia games if anything. There's also some sort of English teaching game that is separate from those others. Now, that was in interesting inclusion. I think it could work to teach any kids the names of animals though. As I said, there is a Disneypedia in this section, which is sort of like a Disney-fied Animal Planet program (running just under 15 minutes). Here, we get to see and learn about the real animals and locations from the film, and while it's aimed at kids too, it can also be enjoyed by adults.

While the DVD extras do lack any theatrical trailers for the feature itself and movie poster art in the gallery section, this still adds up to a fantastic, must-own DVD, as are all the Disney Platinum Edition releases. I suppose that's the real reason why Disney hasn't been putting as much into them as they could lately. Even with less content than the earlier Platinums, they still are amazing sets, especially compared to the original, bare bones releases. ""The Jungle Book"" was released in 1967, by the way, almost a full year after Walt's death. It is inarguably one of his greatest achievements. In 2003, Disney released an all new sequel to theaters, ""The Jungle Book 2."" Despite what most hardcore Disney fans would say, I feel there was great potential in a sequel to the '67 classic. We still hadn't seen what life was like for Mowgli in the Man-Village, and here was the opportunity. Unfortunately, as with most of the sequels to Disney classics, the film was made strictly with a child audience in mind, and it didn't meet its full potential. Also, some great characters weren't included and colors were just plain wrong. It was a theatrical release that looked more like a better-than-average direct-to-video release. While it's not without a certain level of entertainment value, most adult viewers will probably only find merit in this original Masterpiece. If you have to have more of Baloo, Louie, and Shere Khan though, you might first want to pick up the 1990 television series ""TaleSpin"" on DVD. That is, if you don't mind Baloo being transformed into a 1930's aviator in a world of anthropomorphic animals, ha. It really is a wonderful show. There was also a later program more loyal to the Jungle Book setting but featuring the main animal characters as children. It was called ""Jungle Cubs,"" and it was a cute show for the younger set, but it's still not available for purchase. Various live-action Jungle Book films also exist (both by Disney and other studios), and there is a fine cartoon short by Chuck Jones entitled ""Mowgli's Brothers."" Of course, the 1967 Disney animated classic is as good as it gets!",1191801600,7,10303,4.791901012373454
911879,4,6304500831,"Disney successfully weaved together several of Rudyard Kipling's original jungle stories into a fun-filled adventure for children and adults. Well-received and quite memorable, The Jungle Book is full of unforgettable characters and timeless songs, although it was unable to reach the level of emotion and passion that would later be perfected with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.

Bagheera the panther finds an abandoned man cub in a basket and, against his better judgment, delivers it to some fellow wolves to raise as their own. The human child, Mowgli, grows to be a favorite amongst the jungle creatures. But with the news of the return of Shere Kahn, the human-loathing tiger, Bagheera and the others decide it's best if Mowgli is returned to a human village. The boy doesn't want to go, and runs off for adventures with Baloo the bear and King Louie the orangutan before realizing that the jungle really is no place for a human.

The characters are very well-crafted and their designs are flawless. In fact, three of the characters were so popular that they were drafted into their own spin-off TV show, Tailspin. Baloo the bear, King Louie of the apes and Shere Kahn the Tiger became more personified versions of themselves in Tailspin, which was also a huge success. The character designs in The Jungle Book paved the way as templates for future Disney characters including many of those in 1994's The Lion King. Other notable aspects of the inspired animation include the voice casting of Kaa the snake, by Winnie the Pooh's Sterling Holloway, and Colonel Hathi, leader of the marching military-like elephants is voiced by Pat O'Malley.

The animation in The Jungle Book is incredibly life-like and accurate. From Mowgli's carefree hopping about in the jungle, to Bagheera's lithe lunging from tree to tree, to Kaa's bouncy coils, it is evident that each new animated feature by Disney gets more precise and impressive. The last film to be personally supervised by Walt Disney, The Jungle Book was ensured to focus on those important animation details as well as a great story. Not following a particular Rudyard Kipling story, but combining the most intriguing bits of several ideas, only Disney could create such a timeless tale of adventure, laughs and music. The film features several of the most catchy and sing-along songs ever written, including ""The Bear Necessities"" and ""I Wan'na Be Like You.""

The animation is wondrous, but with the lack of shadows and with glaringly noticeable solid colors on each of the characters, it is evident that much improvement could be made in the future. And while 1989 marked the return of Disney's winning streak with The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, The Jungle Book marked one of the last of a run of great animated features up to 1967.

The 2-disc Platinum Edition of the Jungle Book boasts all-new digitally restored picture and sound, games and activities, the unveiling of a long-lost character dubbed ""Rocky the Rhino,"" deleted songs and a making-of featurette.

911880,4,6304500831,"The Jungle Book was Walt Disney's last animated classic.

It's an enchanting film based on the Rudyard Kipling stories about a young human boy named Mowgli, who lives in the jungle among the wild animals. I always find this type of movie so warm and loving. And it helps young people to love and appreciate animals.

We first meet Bagheera, a panther. The baby Mowgli is crying and Bagheera hears him. The wolf pack cares for the baby. Then, years later,the wolves are threatened by Shere Khan. He wants to take revenge on all humanity.

All sorts of problems and dangers occur.

Bagheera just about gives up in his hopes to return the boy. Mowgli, however, sees some beautiful eyes looking at him and he goes into the village. Then good things start to happen.

I didn't think the video was as clear and crisp as it could be. The audio was okay and in Dolby. If not for these two minor issues, I would have given it 5 stars.

So it's wise panther Bagheera (voiced by Sebastian Cabot) to take him to a man village where he would be safe until Mowgali runs into a lovable jungle bum bear named Baloo (Phil Harris) befriends him and goes on a journey from the ruins of jazzy orangutan King Louie (voiced by Louis Prima), the wraith of a hypnotic snake named Kaa (voiced by Sterling Holloway) and finally a battle with Shere Khan.

One of disney's most entertaining and greatest movies ever! This was the last animated movie to be supervised by Walt Disney himself long before he died. Adapated from Rudyard Kipling's novel of the same name and from the stories of ""Mowgali"", this is a charming and exciting animated movie flowing with excellent animation and memorable songs like ""I wanna be like you"" and ""Bear Necessities"". Truly a must have for every collection of animation or for family's library.

The picture and sound quality is phenomenal on this DVD and there's excellent extras like audio commentary, a new ""I wanna be like you"" music vudei, interactive jungle cruise, A documentary on the making of this movie, four featurettes, games, deleted scene with deleted character, deleted songs and art galleries.",1191628800,,1409,4.842323651452282

I went and bought the old 1999 version from a used seller instead, and I recommend that if you're a true Disney animation fan, then you do the same.

911987,5,6304500831,"Disney Studios has become infamous for repeatedly revamping and re-releasing its most celebrated titles.  THE JUNGLE BOOK is the current title on this marketing merry-go-round, and the question inevitably arises: should you replace your earlier DVD with this the new ""Platinum Edition?""  The answer is a firm ""maybe.""

Certainly there's no question about the film itself.  Released in 1967, THE JUNGLE BOOK really is one Disney's finest, a very free adaptation of the Kipling tale of a child who is raised by wolves and must break with the jungle in order to enter human society.  Beautifully animated in the classic hand-rendered style and brilliantly voiced by the likes of Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, and George Sanders, this is a film certain to charm children and adults alike--and it is among the handful of Disney films that I have gone out of my way to keep in my library.

But do I really need all the bells and whistles of the current edition?  The re-master is nice, but I have to note that THE JUNGLE BOOK was never actually in need of a major restoration in the same way that SNOW WHITE, FANTASIA, or PETER PAN were.  It looks great, yes, but you may not notice much difference in picture and sound between the earlier DVD release and the current one.  As for the special features--I enjoyed the audio commentary and the ""making of"" feature; I was also amused by the ""lost scene.""  But I could not care less about the rest of the content, which ranges from the kiddie-silly to the uninspired.

Ultimately, your decision to purchase the Platinum Edition of THE JUNGLE BOOK rests on how much of a Disney fan you actually are.  If you can't bear to let a single item go buy, or if you are particular fan of this title, by all means purchase it--you'll find it worth the money.  And if you don't own it at all, or if you're still making do with an old VHS copy, obviously this is the way to go.  But if you do own the earlier DVD edition and you are happy with it, don't feel you have to make this ""Platinum Edition"" a priority.

Five stars for the film in and of itself!

They did this by chopping off the top and bottom of the image. This results in the loss of a good deal of character animation (at least the tops of their heads and their feet). Trust me, I own the original Limited Issue DVD of this film and I did a side-by-side comparison as soon as I got the new Platinum Edition home. If you are a purist about original aspect ratios, please avoid this release and petition Disney to start a free disc replacement program. We should at least have the option of watching the original unaltered film the way that it was meant to be seen.

911989,4,6304500831,"When Bagheera the panther (voiced by Sebastian Cabot) finds a man cub alone in the jungle, his first instinct is to leave it.  But he can't stand to do that, so he makes sure the boy is adopted by a family of wolves.  As a result, Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman) feels completely comfortable in the jungle.  He loves his home.

Unfortunately, trouble is brewing.  The tiger Shere Khan (George Sanders) has returned to the area and wants to kill Mowgli.  For his own good, the wolf pack decides to have Mowgli return to the man village.

Mowgli doesn't want to go, however, and makes life very difficult on Bagheera, who has agreed to take him.  In his efforts to stay in the jungle, he crosses paths with Baloo, a jungle bum of a bear (Phil Harris), King Louie the monkey (Louis Prima), a military pack of elephants, a boa constrictor with sinus problems (Sterling Holloway), and four vultures with perfect harmony.  But will he leave the jungle?  Is Shere Khan on his trail?

The part of me that is still a kid still loves this movie.  It's got some great laughs and lots of fun songs.  The main characters are a little underdeveloped, but they are still fun and lovable.

However, watching this as an adult, I do notice some flaws.  The animation is simpler then it needs to be, although they have some amazing shots of water here.  And the voices of some of the supporting characters seem a little flat, like they are reading a script and not really trying.

Yes, these are the complaints of an adult looking at the film now.  As a kid, however, I loved it.  And I'm sure today's kids will love it just as much as I did.",1191283200,8,1617,4.420338983050847
911990,5,6304500831,"Mary Poppins is considered by many to be Walt Disney's crowning achievement, combining almost everything he had developed in one movie, and rightly so. But after watching this new double-disc DVD release of THE JUNGLE BOOK, I think a case could be made that it also is the culmination of almost everything Walt and his studio developed in the field of animation.

Now, The Jungle Book is not the most innovative, lavish, dazzling or detailed animated feature in the Disney library. It even has those ""scritchy lines"" that my brother and I used to dislike when the studio switched to Xeroxing cels in the 1960's. But like Poppins, no other animation studio could have produced a feature with the kind of character animation; storytelling and musical interweaving that Disney could in this film.

There's a reason that the master animators and directors of today who you'll see interviewed on the second disc were influenced by The Jungle Book in their youth and used the animation as reference for their work. When I saw and heard the songs and story ideas that did not make their way into the film (and they are plentiful on this release) because Walt changed them, it will make you wonder how post-Walt movies might have been different had he lived to supervise them.

I love good audio commentaries, and disc one has a nice one with composer Richard Sherman, animator Andreas Deja and voice of Mowgli Bruce Reitherman. Thanks to Mr. Sherman, I finally found out that George Sanders does not sing the last line of ""That's What Friends Are For."" It's Bill Lee, whom Tim and I discuss at length in Mouse Tracks. (And speaking of records, the gallery contains a shot of a store display filled with Disneyland Jungle Book LP's.)

Musically, you can hear seven songs Terry Gilkyson wrote for the earlier, ""darker"" version of The Jungle Book. It's fascinating stuff. One of the songs sound like it should have been in a Rankin/Bass special. And the original demo of ""The Bare Necessities"" is very different from the version we all know.

We finally get to see what the ""Rocky Rhino"" sequence might have been like before Walt deleted it. It's also amazing to hear what ""That's What Friends Are For"" might have sounded like had The Beatles or the had either done the voices for the vultures or, after they declined, had Walt not changed his mind about having the vultures sing like them anyway. My feeling is that Walt was right about it being dated. An unintended example: Entertaining as The Jonas Brothers video is that also appears on this disc (from DisneyMania 5), if this young group actually sang ""I Wan'na Be Like You"" in the movie it would have the same era-specific pop music effect.

Disney fans will want to glory in the fresh batch of special features on disc two. Detailed examinations of how the story evolved from Bill Peet's vision to Walt's, nods to the voice talents with anecdotes about them (how everyone thought Walt was crazy for considering Phil Harris for Baloo), and lots of new and archival footage of everyone involved. Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston and Wollie Reitherman are especially showcased, with a special look at Wollie's son Bruce's career as a nature filmmaker with an affection glimpse of his relationship with his ""Popper.""

I can't think of any DVD release with such a touching exploration of the loss of Walt for the people he left behind at the studio, since this was the last animated feature with his personal involvement. In a section at the end of ""The Making of The Jungle Book,"" there's a lot of sincere sentiment from those that knew him, loved him and were influenced by him.",1191196800,8,3619,4.753184713375796

The story of Mowgli, Baloo, and Bagheera is well-known by now; watching it after all these years has increased my appreciation of it. I highly recommend watching the Making-of documentaries first, as they will also enhance your viewing experience. Especially enlightening is the story of how Walt changed the Rudyard Kipling tale and why (and to learn that he actually returned to the original text for his inspiration of how to end his version). It is also somewhat sad to see that this was the last film to have Disney's indelible stamp on it due to his death, yet also inspiring to hear the animators talk about what they put into the film as well as future animators who were inspired as youngsters by viewing it. Different concepts along the way are interesting to see, and not surprising to learn that Phil Harris put much of his own personality into the dialogue and characterization of Baloo. The other extras are fun too, including the games (although some could benefit from better instructions, such as the follow Kaa's eyes game).

912077,5,6304500831,"With so many Disney DVDs to choose from, is ""The Jungle Book,"" even a new ""Platinum"" version, really a must buy?

Absolutely. Just 78 minutes long, this unpretentious adventure is full of imaginative characters, charming song and dance routines, interesting themes and innocent good humor. Unlike many Disney films, ""The Jungle Book"" doesn't strive to be high art and has no groundbreaking special effects, but it's still one of the company's best animated films. And now the film has now been ""digitally enhanced,"" with a brighter contrast and cleaner colors.

Telling the tale of Mowgli, a human boy brought up in the jungles of India, the movie is a freewheeling adaptation of some Victorian-era short stories by British writer Rudyard Kipling. Rescued as an infant by a protective panther named Bagheera, the boy is raised by wolves and adopted by a carefree bachelor bear, Baloo. Disney punches up the stories with Western jokes and music (the pop soundtrack includes Baloo's and orangutan King Louie's infectious scat duet ""I Wanna Be Like You"" and Baloo's perky prickly pear primer, ""The Bear Necessities""), but wisely eliminates Kipling's patronizing overtones.

""The Jungle Book"" teaches children a number of good life lessons. It demonstrates that the world includes enemies as well as friends, and that enemies sometimes disguise themselves as friends. It argues that though its fun to pretend you're someone you're not, it's best to accept the person you are.

It has two lessons about love. First, that true love is unselfish, as Baloo learns when he realizes he must finally return Mowgli to the ""man village."" And second, as Mowgli realizes in the final scene, that the ultimate male fulfillment is the love of a good woman. Or, as my husband views the segment, the pursuit of a wide-eyed flirt.

Parents can take note of a classic Disney touch: the acceptance of both religion and science. The film begins with the infant Mowgli lying in a basket along a riverbank, a reference to Moses that's not in the Kipling stories. Later, however, there's a nod to Darwin, as the orangutan King Louie greets the human boy with an outstretched hand, saying ""Shake hands, cousin.""

If nothing else, adults can enjoy identifying the distinctive character voices (Kaa is voiced by Sterling Holloway, the Cheshire Cat in ""Alice in Wonderland"" and best known as Winnie the Pooh) or laughing at the chorus of Beatle-like vultures. One looks just like Ringo. Sounds like him, too.

If you're a fan of the story you may also want to check out Disney's live-action (and non-musical) version, 1994's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rudyard-Kipling-s-The-Jungle-Book/dp/B00005T5YC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book</a>.

""The Jungle Book"" is Rudyard Kipling's story of Mowgli, a boy raised by the wolves in the jungles of India.  Mowgli cavorts with his buddies Balloo, a lazy bum of a bear, and Bagheera, a worry-wort black Panther.  His very menacing enemies are Shere Khan, the tiger, and Kaa, the sibilant python.  It's a child's dream tale of life in the jungle, free from the restraints of school and parents and civilization.

The highlights of this movie are nearly endless:  Phil Harris is superb as the laid-back Baloo; George Sanders plays a tiger with upper-class diction and (one suspects) unusual sexual preferences;  Louis Prima belts out a showstopping musical number. The Elephant march is touching, funny, and toe-tapping.  Mowgli himself is a charming, sunny boy.

Mowgli is a forerunner to the likes of Tarzan. It boggles my mind to think of the imagination -- the daydreams -- Kipling must have had to come up with this story.

If you're a girl in my family, this one is 16th  and Mermaid is 15th.  The strengths here are the cute retelling of an old story and some good music.

912294,5,6304500831,"Based Rudyard Kipling's classic story, Disney's JUNGLE BOOK delivers a laugh out loud, fun, sing-along classic. In my opnion, this was one of the most fun Disney classics. Along with a great soundtrack and fun musical numbers, the entire family will enjoy this one.
Mogli is a young boy who was orphaned when he was a baby and then was found by a pack of wolves. Now that Mogli is older, Shiar Khan the tiger, wants Mogli dead. Now the wolves and Bagira the panther have to bring him back to the human village to be with his own kind and for his own safety. Mogli wants no part of that and while running away from Begari's sight, he runs into Baloo, a fun loving Bear who teaches Mogli how to have a good time and the ""Bear Necessities"".
I really love this movie. This one is a lot of fun. I only had one problem with this movie and that was a little animation recycling in the ""Friend Like Me"" scene with King Louie (if you saw ROBIN HOOD or ARISTOCATS, you'll see what I mean). But even that wasn't enough for me to take off a star. I still think this is a 5 star Disney classic.
If you're looking for other fun Disney classics, check out ROBIN HOOD, ALICE IN WONDERLAND and WINNIE THE POOH 25th Anniversary DVD. And if you're looking for a great Rudyard Kipling book, look for RIKI TIKI TAVI. Enjoy!",1043280000,10,1302,4.275303643724697

So he brings the baby to a pack of woods and about a few years later the baby now growing into about 5 maybe 10 years old man cub named Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman). But Mowgli has to go to a man village because a tiger named Shere Khan has return to the jungle and is going to kill Mowgli because he hates hunters with gun and fire. But Mowgli wants to stay in the jungle, and finally Bageera gives up a lets him be on his own. And he meets a bear named Baloo (Phil Harris).

Mowgli is sassy, resourceful and independent without being in the least bit irritating.  Something none of todays animation movies (with the exception of chicken run) seem capable of achieveing.
This is long before the days of computerized everything, each scene is a genius work of just watercolors and ink pen.
The most hilarious scenes are those of Col hathi and his jungle march. The jazz bit with the monkeys is a very close second.
""The bare necessities of life..."" could be the byword by which we live.
Sher khan, Col. haathi evoke days of british imperialism with ease.  These characters and those of Kaa, Bhageera, Bhalo and of couse Mowgli will surely live on forever in the hearts of those of us who were young and innocent when this movie came out.

Excellent picture and sound quality, I don't have to recommend you the story itself, because it has proven to be one of the best. I could go on and on about it, but I trust you to know a little bit about Kipling, just as I trust Disney to produce high quality anim. cartoons as they usually do.

912408,5,6304500831,"When it comes to DVDs, I would probably be the first in line to complain about releases that have mediocre supplements. But I felt like I had to make an exception when it came to Disney. All of their ""Limited Issues"" seem to have little or no extras at all, but the actual animated classic that the disc holds, for me anyway, more then makes up for it.
""The Jungle Book"" is one of the first Disney Movies that I watched as a kid. I bought the DVD, and I saw the movie today for the first time in around 12 years. The entertainment value is suprisingly still there, and more over, as a grown up movie fan, I can appreciate the film more as a classic in animated films from Disney & not just a 'cartoon' to pass the time, like I considered it to be as an adolecent.
The picture and sound is satisfying for the film's age and genre; the Spanish Dubbing is an excellent addition, for some of my family anyway. But it pales in comparison to the English vocals; The animation is terrific, too bad it wasn't created in a widescreen aspect ratio, it would have been a great visual to have looked at (The film is presented in it's original theatrical aspect ratio, 1.33:1).
Now that the announcment of Disney's 10 ""Platinum Editions"" have been made (The first of the 10 being ""Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs"", but ""Jungle Book"" will be one of the other 9), this ""Jungle Book - Limited Issue"" is a fine way to have the film until the full-fleged ""Jungle Book - Platinum Edition"" is released sometime in the next decade.
