6040387,4,B00FYYS9D2,My husband and I are learning the Electric slide and Cupid shuffle. We find the instructions easy to follow and fun.,1389139200,7,116,4.571428571428571
6040388,5,B00FYYS9D2,"It was easy to learn, fun, loved all the diffrent steps you could add too. The instructor looked great so easy to watch",1389052800,6,119,4.217391304347826
6040389,5,B00FYYS9D2,"I haven't been Club Line Dancing in like . . . EVER, but with these videos I certainly could. Years ago at a Summer BBQ, my friends adult daughter tried to teach me Club Line Dancing and it was like inviting a dyslexic to an Army marching drill. Hard as I tried to learn, I was forever turning left when she turned right. From watching these DVDs I can see now what she was trying to show me.

The instruction on these DVDs is easy to follow, and repetitive enough for one section to build on the other. Perfect for me, as I tend to forget what Ive just learned in class. When I need to, I can just rewind and review. In live dance classes I just have to take more classes until I get it, and then if I sit out for a month, I start all over again. It can get costly for me. Shawn breaks the hottest dance steps into manageable chunks, and builds on what we just learned.

Both Shawn and Joanna are easy to learn from. Shawn models some styling that looks cool and natural for a guy and Joanna adds some great tips for the women on styling. And its pretty cool to be learning the hottest club dances.

I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get up on the dance floor and move with style.

For just one DVD this would be a great purchase, but for the set of two this is a GREAT bargain. For the dance skills youll come away with, this is time and money well spent. Best of all is a little bonus at the end: full instructional review, followed by music to dance to both slow and fast tempo. Now that Im comfortable with a few dances, I can just skip to the end for a quick workout before I start my work day. Thanks Shawn - this is a great product. I hope it sells like crazy!",1388880000,40,1688,4.029850746268656
6040390,5,B00FYYS9D2,"Club Line Dancing I & 2  is awesome!!  No more sitting like a wallflower while everyone else is up having fun line dancing. Shawns instructions are so easy to follow. He teaches basic steps, but he also demonstrates more advanced versions of each step. The music is leveled with both slower and faster beats. I was able to keep up with the slower music while still learning the steps and progress to the faster music as Im becoming more proficient. Joanna did the basic steps while Shawn did more advance styling. Im able to progress at my own pace and look classy out there. How convenient to be able to watch the instruction over and over, unlike out on the dance floor. I received this DVD as a Christmas present. What a fun gift! Its a 5-Star dance DVD packed with instruction, fun, and great exercise. Youre going to love it.

6040391,5,B00FYYS9D2,"I own Shawn Trautman's older line dance DVD, Party Line Dances (2005), and this is definitely new and improved! The setting is more club-like, the DVD is MUCH longer, there are two people to watch, not just Shawn (it's nice to have Joanna to watch, since women and men don't always do the moves exactly the same way), and they both seem to be relaxed and having fun. I enjoyed the old DVD, but I really like the changes!  I already knew some of the dances on this DVD, but there were some new ones I wanted to try. I like how Shawn and Joanna introduce a few of the steps at a time, allow for practice, and then add on. Once you have learned all of the steps, they take you through the entire dance with a slower song, and then a song with the same speed you'll get in the clubs. I know copyright is an issue with music, but that's okay since the clubs don't always use the same songs for the dances-I've experienced that recently! After I went through the instruction, I especially liked being able to go to the menu and choose to practice the songs with music, with either fast or slow music. This took me directly to the part of the instruction where I could do the dance, with Shawn calling out the steps. This menu option will allow me to easily go back and practice the dances I was a little stuck on, and I will use this feature in the future!",1388707200,,1350,4.1923076923076925
6040392,5,B00FYYS9D2,"As a beginning dancer, the details are extremely important.  The count, shifting weight, which leg to start on.  With some of the other DVD's it always seemed as if the instructor would forget to mention some of these critical details.  Shawn breaks down the movements, the steps, and the beats in such a way that I am able to follow and not get lost.  He also has a way of being repetitive enough without being too repetitive and wasting time.  On top of the intuitive instruction, the line dance selection hits the mark as far as the most frequent and popular line dances at all the bars in my area.

I highly recommend this DVD to girls and guys alike.  It has taught me that ""rhythm"" is a learned behavior and gave me hope that I might be able to dance something other than  like a robot. I also like how the instructor highlights some of the key areas to make it look like you have a little swag without overdoing it.  All things considered, this has to be one of the best value instructional DVDs you can buy.  5 stars.",1388361600,27,1025,4.319371727748691
6040393,1,B00FYYS9D2,The instruction is fairly good as far as learning the dance itself but why then would they not dance to the actual music for a particular line dance.  I cannot believe I paid for this.........,1388102400,,192,4.485714285714286
6040394,5,B00FYYS9D2,"Alright, so this was a gamble for me.. that payed!  I have been trying to learn a few of these line dances by mimicking the others in in the crowd, watching a ton of different youtube videos and even tried two different group classes.  None of that seemed to do much good.  I am really not very coordinated I suppose.  Got the club line dance dvds a few days ago and totally love em!  They go through all the steps nice and slow first, and then keep adding on until they've gone thru the whole thing, then they dance to music, twice, while shawn mixes it up the girl stays doing the original steps, plus shawn calls out where you should be to help keep you on track.

I kept moving like the whole time, so it was fairly exhausting, had to take a break half way thru the first dvd and have not gotten to the second one yet.  Quite a bargain.  Excited to start number two tomorrow!

I am really impressed with instruction and quality, these guys definitely know what they are doing.

Now if only I can get my boyfriend to move his lazy bones and do this with me!  Any advice on that one Shawn?

Seriously though, thanks a mil for these DVDs, going to the club tonight and can't wait to impress some friends and my man with my new moves!",1386892800,68,1234,4.182203389830509
6040395,5,B00FYYS9D2,"This DVD is very accessible for the beginner who has two left feet (that's me).  The instructors are extremely easy to follow and I recommend this course to anyone who feels as if they really want to join in when that music starts but just can't seem to keep up with everyone who already knows the steps.  I'd always wanted to be able to do these dances at weddings and cruises without feeling self-conscious.  Now, I feel as if I can Wobble with the best of them.  It only took about two hours to learn a wide variety of popular dances, and I even learned some flourishes that will make me actually look as if I know what I'm doing.

The systematic approach to instruction totally works.  You first learn the steps, and there aren't any strange angles to make it confusing.  Then, you practice to a slower song, and finally, you do a fast one.  The music is great and you are able to really focus on the steps because the lyrics don't get in the way. I wasn't looking for a workout, but I definitely raised my heart rate.  All in all, this is a wonderful way to learn club line dances.",1386547200,41,1086,4.284313725490196
6040396,5,B00FYYS9D2,"I just purchased Club Line Dances 1&2 and am absolutely thrilled with how easy it was to learn the steps to some of the more popular line dances!! I am not a dancer by any stretch, but with upcoming weddings, I wanted to make sure I could hold my own when these dances come up for the crowds. I tried using YouTube, but I never seemed to be able to follow well and the instructors presumed the viewer knew the basics. In the Club Line Dances instructional DVD set, Shawn and Joanna are able to break down the steps in an easy-to-understand method, and after a couple of practice rounds with them on the DVD, I found myself doing the steps without having to think about it!

The instruction is well-paced, the music was hot, and I liked the options Shawn provided to kick it up a notch if I wanted to, while Joanna continued each dance in the most basic form so you never miss a step. It reminded me of exercise videos where one person always does the routine at a slower pace.

Now, there is one thing you should be aware of - when you get to the bonus section on disc 2, you have to select the first Cha-Cha Slide song from the menu to get the full instruction. If you don't you'll think the instruction is not included.

I already know I'm going to purchase these as gifts for my girlfriends. The dances are great fun, Shawn and Joanna are clear and easy to follow, and I can see this DVD set as a fresh alternative to low impact exercise as well. Oh-- I'm 55 years old and you can bet I'll be on the dance floor like I belong there!!",1385942400,153,1536,4.1824324324324325

6040398,5,B00FYYS9D2,"Great instructional video. Easy to follow, step-by-step for beginners. I picked up Cupid Shuffle, Electric Slide (my favorite) and the Two Step quickly enough. Cotton-Eyed Joe and Footloose are proving more of a challenge. But hey, practice, practice, practice. I didn't have an issue not having the original music. Copyright and licensing laws prohibit using the original music. I downloaded the songs to my phone. Once I have the steps down, I mute the instructions and use the music from my phone to find my rhythm (which is usually lost to me), but works pretty well.",1528675200,,571,4.958333333333333

6040410,5,B00FYYS9D2,Item arrived promptly and in good condition.  Loved the instruction technique and demonstrations.  Very easy to follow.  Learned much more from the DVD than from live classes because I could repeat the video as often as I wanted to conform the steps and the sequences to learn the dances.  The classes I took covered too much material each week so learning (for me) really required the DVD which I could was very definitive  and easy to use.,1522022400,2,441,4.675324675324675

They walk you through the dance slowly then you go through it again a little faster then you try it to music.

And, I am finally enjoying dancing instead of always worrying about making a fool of myself. Actually, I am now one of the best Line Dancers in our monthly dances (of about 100 people), and the attention I am now receiving from my improved performance is great. These 2 DVDs have helped me enjoy Line Dancing as much as I originally thought I would.

It was so much fun knowing how to do the dances. In the past I didn't know what I was doing so I was watching everybody else and trying to keep up, BUT THIS TIME, ha, I was out there doing the Electric Slide like a pro. No more watching other people's feet. While I didn't get out on the floor when the Cupid Shuffle came on I knew exactly what they were doing, and the same with the Wobble. I knew who was doing it right and who wasn't. lol I now want to take lessons to learn how to shag and dance to ""beach"" music. There was a lot of ""beach"" music played and believe it or not, disco. In the past I haven't been out dancing much, but I think that is going to have to change. Thank you again for your lessons.",1487548800,2,873,3.88268156424581

I have watched several videos for dancing and really feel he has done it best. Many of the tapes used awful music to try to learn with and have had many friends complain about it. Shawn did the best job I have seen with the music. Hoping I can find a ball room dance class from him. I would buy it in a heartbeat.,1485043200,3,475,3.9583333333333335

6040528,5,B00FYYS9D2,"We were to attend a July 4th Wedding of a Nephew and I decided since most of the attendees would be young people doing line dances I bought this Video.  What a life saver.  I took it to my Daughter's home who had a 12yr. old boy, sister 9yrs. and Mom coming to visit.  Soooo! of course we put this on so we could (the old people 50-75 yrs.) could learn some steps.  We had such a ball and they did not want to go home.  My Son-in-Law did the directing and some steps too.
On the day of the Wedding Rehearsal, I stayed back before heading out for the dinner and practiced some steps.
Wow, at the Wedding our little group could get up and do most of those dances they had played.  The parents had to add another hour for the DJ who was so good.
If you can dance a little you can use these steps to the Music of today that is played.
Thank-you so much.  I had gone to every store here in the City and could not find anything to use for dance lessons.  Then I thought Amazon must have something.  How lucky for me I am a Prime member and received this in enough time to practice.  We have two Weddings to attend early in 2017.  I have to take this out again.  The reviews also helped me decide which Dance program to get.  Thanks to all of you.
One other thing.  This is really a good exercise program too.  I just have to learn how to use the DVD player.  At 76 yrs.  I'm not too old to learn.",1477526400,4,1390,3.96028880866426

Disappointed with the DVD.  The dance instructions should have been done to the corresponding music that they belong to.

I had some minor questions about the music and Shawn responded promptly with helpful information.

Thank you for explaining why you couldn't use the songs we are used to hearing with these dances.  That part was disappointing.  However, using other music to do these dances helps us to understand we can dance to other songs with the same beats!

I'm glad the original music is not featured. I had an experience in a real life workout situation where the instructor liked Neon Moon and every single exercise class played that song, sometimes more than once. In about a week I could not go back, and still don't like the song--I  simply got sick of it!

Maybe, in this case, it wouldn't happen and I could listen to all of these dance songs over and over as I'm learning to dance, and then bounce out on the dance floor and have a lovely time, but I suspect it would feel boring; same-old, same-old, you know?

6040633,5,B00FYYS9D2,"I have been a dance instructor for over 10 years now and wanted to see how Shawn teaches at a beginner level.  From a pure instruction standpoint Shawn Trautman is articulate, easy to understand and easy to follow.  He builds each dance slowly and with lots of repetition for people who are new dancers.  I can see how people with dance experience would find the instruction a bit slow, however, for beginners, the instruction is spot on as Shawn makes it foolproof and does a great job of letting you know what's coming up before you do it.  I also like that there's a basic version of most of the dances and that his partner shows it consistently while Shawn demonstrates how to add additional steps in when you're ready.  Though the music is not the actual songs, most of the time is spent on the instruction, so it won't affect what you're learning.  As an instructor, it's common to use slower tempo songs for practice purposes and then the full speed song when ready, so the way they used two songs per dance was very helpful.  I would have preferred dancing them to the actual songs but I understand the licensing limitations as an instructor.  I plan to use a lot of his concepts in my beginner classes and am already thankful for the confidence he gave me.",1449014400,,1265,4.493449781659389

6040639,4,B00FYYS9D2,This is easy to follow along. But the beginner needs to follow Joanna for the basic steps and the camera mostly follows Shawn. I learned one dance quickly and just need to muster my coordination to look like I'm not ice skating for the first time.,1447804800,,247,4.391304347826087
6040640,5,B00FYYS9D2,"Hats of to you Shawn. I have been trying to learn this since last summer
Could not get the hang of it so each time I gave up. I even tried YouTube. One evening
 I dicided to give line dancing another try. Checked out Amazon for DVDs,since youtube
did not work for me. Felt comfortable with the content of the Club Line Dances 1/2. and within
 3days of using the DVD, I was able to do the first two dances .
 Thanks, Shawn for building my confidence. Knew I could do this with the right teacher.",1447718400,,494,4.125

Shame I cannot send it back!  A lot of money for nothing.",1447718400,3,445,4.211764705882353
6040642,5,B00FYYS9D2,I think I can finally learn to line dance!  The instructions are very easy to follow; they are are repetitive enough to allow you to master one step before moving on to the next.  Thank you Shawn Trautman!,1447632000,,205,4.368421052631579
6040643,5,B00FYYS9D2,I am really enjoying the line dance DVDs.  The instructions are easy to follow and go at just the right pace.  I am thinking of ordering a set of these for my sister as a Christmas gift.,1447113600,,186,4.0

You and your wife do an amazing work, and you make learning dancing fun and easy to understand.  Don not change, and keep up the good work!!  Grateful am I.  I am in a line dancing class presently, and I am having a lot of trouble learning.  Your video is priceless, because it provides a better understanding of how to line dance by parts of the whole dance before putting the entire dance together.",1446595200,3,561,4.863157894736842

6040650,5,B00FYYS9D2,"I bought these DVDs to get an enjoyable form of exercise and they have done the trick. The instruction is very gradual for each dance step and I especially appreciate that each dance is first done to music at a slower pace before moving to the full paced version. I have trouble remembering the sequence of steps on my own, so having Shawn call out the steps throughout the dances is a big help. The music and the dances are fun and definitely a good moderate workout for me.",1445731200,2,475,4.348314606741573

At first I was wondering why he didn't use the original music but he explained it was because of copyright issues. The most important thing to me was learning the dance steps. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn line dancing.

It was fun and and the results speak for themselves.  I am so excited to participate in line dances at my next event!",1444608000,,429,4.605263157894737

I used this video And was comfortably doing several on the very first night.  So comfortable that I can go on our cruise this year and not embarrass my girlfriend.  They are incredibly easy to follow. Sean is so good at patiently walking through the steps and repeating them, and seems to do it just enough times for me to get the hang of it  that is so incredibly easy to follow.

The super fun thing is that my husband has started to join me on the workouts and it makes it so much more fun! I can't wait to really get it down where I know the dances well enough to start adding some ""groove"" to my style!

The steps are presented in such a way that they are easy to follow. When the tempo speeds up, we do find that some people have two left feet -- or two right feet -- but the dance goes on, and by the time the music is added we're all together. Thanks so much.

We have a big screen TV in our living room, so we pushed back all of the furniture and gave it a try.  What a workout!!  We have danced our way through the first DVD and absolutely love it.  Shawn's instruction is so easy to follow and when he started throwing in some fancy steps we weren't quite up to, we just followed Joanna with the basic steps.  The repetition was helpful, showing each move slowly and repeatedly until we got it.  Once we had the first set somewhat down, we moved to the collection of full speed steps at the end of the DVD.  So far we haven't had the wind to make it all the way through all 5 songs.  But we sure do work up a good sweat trying!  Thanks, Shawn and Joanna, for a great product.  We're not quite ready to go public yet, but we will.  Oh, yes, we will!!  We highly recommend this DVD set for anyone interested in learning to line dance.",1439424000,9,1004,4.092307692307692

He goes at a perfect pace, and great for me being a beginner.  You can stop and repeat any section or dance if you want to but I just kept going and didn't need to do that.  I can't wait to get thru it all and really know how to do these dances. Plus he gives a little extra effort to make you look good while doing it.. his wife does the 'basic steps' all the time and he adds an extra move or turn. .that kind of thing. This is SO much better and less expensive than going to dance lessons.. (as I did when I was young)... wish we had DVD's back then!  I would not have wasted so much money on person-to-person lessons.  Love to be able learn to do this in my own home ... really fun!",1438560000,3,836,3.8372093023255816

6040687,5,B00FYYS9D2,Wish I could give it 10 stars! This is the best instruction I have ever seen and was the first video I retained the information from.

6040689,1,B00FYYS9D2,"The instructors were very professional and thorough and demonstrated steps in manageable chunks. Kudos to them. However, I gave the DVD one star because the music used was nothing I had heard or would probably hear in any dance venue I most likely would attend. A couple of the dances (2-step and cotton-eyed joe) seemed more appropriate for a real country style venue and not a ""club"" venue--a matter of interpretation on my part.  Probably a good instructional video otherwise.",1437264000,7,479,4.9875

These beginner lessons are perfect for the beginner, but an experienced dancer may find it a little slow. I would recommend that once you get these steps so they are comfortable, you may want to get the popular songs by the original recording artists that the dances are used for and have some fun. I would random shuffle them so that I knew the steps would be easy to recall later on.
These lessons gave us a great foundation for sure!!!

Shawn and his wife show you the steps and then she keeps the simple routine while he continues with a bit more jazzing it up.

These are beginner line dances and easy to follow Shawn and Joanna. They are broken down to easy steps and then put together for the whole line dance. I like the added steps that Shawn throws in and my mom prefers the basic version of each line dance and follows Joanna. We practice with the video, then download the original songs from iTunes that go with the line dances.  Then play them off the laptop or make a dvd and play it (for personal use). We make our own playlist so we can keep dancing :).  I like that they break each line dance down into small pieces and call the moves out loud.  I already knew some of them but learned some cues to help teach my friends. I like the slow version first, and sometimes have to go back to that if it's been awhile and forgot one. If it is still to fast or you have a sticky spot put the remote on slow play. I didn't have to do that with this set, but I've done it before. If you have never line danced, some advise just learn one or two at a time. We have found that writing a cheat sheet of the beginning steps for a new one that we learned also helps for when we go out and don't have the dvd with us (LOL).",1408492800,2,1313,3.9101123595505616

One of the reasons that I purchased these DVDs was so my husband and I could have a fun way to exercise together and learn dance moves at the same time. It seemed like a win win situation to me.  I have always wanted to learn to dance; everyone always looks like they are having so much fun out on the dance floor, but it has always been so difficult for me to learn from other people. I guess one reason that I never learned is because I was shy about looking silly in public.
I have tried to follow how to videos on youtube before, but I just could never seem to catch on. The your right my left thing always seem to throw me off. lol  The way that Shawn teaches makes it so incredibly easy! I learned three daces on the first day that my DVD came in the mail! I have not yet practiced my new found knowledge out in public yet, but at least now I will know the moves when I decide to jump in. :-)

6040796,5,B00FYYS9D2,"We ordered this set on June 29'14 from Amazon. Since we did not have time play all through chapters as an acceptance test, we randomly played a few dances. We found that:

GOOD: the content is great. The discs are for real, real beginners - like us. We have been looking for lessons at this level for a long time; did not find one until we found Mr. Shawn Trautman's . So, if you never dance or you know a little bit of dancing but now want to become more confident, we strongly suggest that you buy this set.

CON: We found the section titles ""Bonus: Cha-Cha Slide"", at the end of Disc 2, has technical error: one minute into the section, when the music was introduced as ""about to start,"" the section abruptly ends (we would like to suggest that Mr. Trautman plays this section.)

We plan to call Mr. Trautman to see if he will send us a replacement or -  although we really want to keep it -  we will have to return this set to Amazon -

UPDATED on July 18'14: FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE!

Fantastic customer service ... Shawn responded and offered us a solution just a few hours after our review. This husband & wife team, Shawn & Joanna Trautman, takes turn to keep us informed that steps are taken to have their DVD manufacturer correct the production error. A new and correct set is on the way to us as a replacement for the one with error.

Although we originally rated 2 stars due to the DVD production error, we have been very satisfied with the content with the DVDs since we received them. With the correct DVDs to replace and with this level of customer service, we think it deserves the rate of 5 stars.

By the way, before we were informed that we will receive a replacement, we feel so comfortable with the dancing instructions that we had ordered Shawn's  11-DVD Super Set from www.shawntrautman.com (Amazon does not carry this). The Trautmans is running ""Christmas"" sale in July on their website ... We have received this set; it has several different dancing styles. Joanna left her advices on our answering machine which dance we should start first.

We purchased this DVD set with no idea as to how the instruction would be presented. But what a blast! We've never had so much fun together!! Couldn't stop laughing- but somehow we actually learned a few dances- which is a testament to the instruction itself.

I read some of the previous reviews before ordering and don't really understand how anyone could complain. Especially about the music! As another person has stated- that's not what you order an ""instructional"" dance DVD for. They have been more than successful at what they are intended to do- instruct & teach. Who cares what music is playing- we're learning to dance!! :)

I've just ordered a 2nd copy to send to my daughter in Atlanta as she is much more likely to be out in the clubs than I am. Might have to plan a road trip for a night on the town!!

We'll get her to do a review, as well. Compare the 50's review to the 20's?!?",1402704000,2,1122,4.328571428571428

6040810,5,B00FYYS9D2,It was exactly as described and as I needed. Its a great DVD. It was a step by step instruction which was what I was looking for. It takes you through the beginning steps first with a dance and then each dance introduces you to new steps along with the old ones. Great for anyone that wants to learn line dancing. Thank you,1400457600,,323,4.142857142857143
6040811,4,B00FYYS9D2,Easy for my school kids as well as myself to learn. Line dancing no need for partners so it is good for school kids.,1399852800,,116,3.875

6040813,5,B00FYYS9D2,"This is a fabulous DVD, I found it very easy to follow along and learn the dances. The instructors are great, they take it slow and easy, but at the same time, offer options to spice up your moves later on, making this an ongoing learning experience. Would love to see what else these guys have out there.",1399161600,,305,4.275862068965517
6040814,5,B00FYYS9D2,"I have been basically sitting on the sidelines every time these line dances begin at the club and finally decided to try one of Shawn's line dance DVDs. He's other, more tradition couples dance DVDs have always been great, so this was no brainer and it delivered 110%.

Each dance taught is first thoroughly explained and instructed step by step and then done to music. Plus each dance is also done to two different songs in the review section where you dance along with Shawn and Joanna. This is really a great feature as the first song is a bit slower beats per minute then the second which is exactly the same as the song you would expect on the dances that have somewhat of a common song for that particular dance.

After reading a lot of the feedback on here I am somewhat surprised at the negativity based on the music choices. The DVD does exactly what it is designed to, teach you each line dance step by step. The music they use is spot on for the rhythm, style and beats per minute so when you dance the line dance in a club environment you know exactly what to do. In fact, learning the line dance to a less common song helped me in solidifying and focusing on the steps without having to think about the lyrics in the song, but instead the beat of the music.

Fantastic instruction, great music and perfect for a beginner like me!",1398643200,,1342,4.36
6040815,1,B00FYYS9D2,This DVD sucked! I tried this DVD and these happy go lucky people do not even use the right music. If this is really for the club then the music that is supposed to be used should be included so that using this dvd can be realistic....I regret buying this dvd. It was a waste of money. I broke it up and threw it in the trash. I am sure Shawn does not care he was paid.....To me this DVD was nothing more than false advertisement! I was under the impression....wondering if all the rave reviews were from friends and family....,1398643200,2,527,4.227722772277228

I wasn't crazy about his music choices though.  He suggested songs that each dance could be danced to, but then had different songs on the DVD.",1398297600,,313,4.553571428571429

6040822,1,B00FYYS9D2,"This DVD was not at all what I expected. I thought I would hear some of the music that went along with the dances, but it was slow and boring and they didn't have the rhythm I was hoping for. Disappointed!",1398038400,,205,4.024390243902439
6040823,5,B00FYYS9D2,"My husband and I recently returned from a cruise where we participated in line dancing classes.  Even though we are inexperienced line dancers, and had trouble keeping up, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  We are planning another cruise in the next few months, and this time we want to be prepared.  With that in mind, I ordered this DVD.  It had good ratings, and I thought it was worth a try.  It was the perfect choice.  Shawn and Joanna Trautman break down the dances into small segments that you can go back and review until you have them mastered before moving on to the next moves.  Each dance introduces new moves, as well as using some of those used in previous dances on the DVD.  They demonstrate each move clearly, and while Joanna keeps doing the basic moves, Shawn embellishes them to show how you can add your own touches to the dances once you've mastered the basics.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn to line dance in a fun and easy way!  After just a few days of dancing along with Shawn and Joanna, I'm confident that my husband and I will fit right in when we join the other line dancers on our next cruise.  Even if the dances are different, we'll have a good background of the basic moves in line dancing so we'll easily be able to pick up on any new steps.

I was so pleased with this DVD that I ordered Shawn's Two-Step DVD as well.  We're looking forward to perfecting that dance as well as the line dances.

Thank you Shawn and Joanna!  I plan to purchase more of your DVDs in the future!",1397606400,2,1538,4.347368421052631
6040824,4,B00FYYS9D2,"I don't mind instructional videos, in fact, I prefer detail. But when the detail is at a pace so slow, the point gets lost and you end up speeding ahead so you won't lose what was learned. Other than that, the video did allow me to learn the dances I wanted.",1396828800,,258,4.078431372549019
6040825,5,B00FYYS9D2,"My husband and I are frequent attendees at weddings where dancing at the reception is an event staple.  Our local town square also has monthly concerts in the park where the basic party dances often break out to get the crowd engaged.  Line dancing is definitely a favorite at these events and looks like a lot of fun!  I decided it was time to learn these dances so that we would no longer just be spectators on the side.  I am thrilled with the instruction that Shawn and Joanna provide in this video.  They break the moves down into small steps, at a slow pace and repeat the short sequences, building on them a little bit at a time.  Before the end of instruction on any one of the dances, the steps have been easily absorbed into my muscle memory and feel very natural.  As an extra bonus, I have added the line dancing lessons to my morning exercise routine.  I completely forget to watch the clock, as the time spent learning the dances flies by so quickly and is such a pleasure.  I definitely recommend this video to anyone wanting to get off the sidelines and participate!",1396828800,,1082,4.424242424242424
