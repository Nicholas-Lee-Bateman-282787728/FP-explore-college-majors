2289349,2,B0009GV9CS,"After reading the effusive reviews of my fellow-reviewers, and buying it based on their recommendation, I find this product a major disappointment. When I was able to begin buying my own LPs in college, 30 years ago, Il Trovatore was one of the first operas I bought.

In watching this version, I was bored stiff. I don't consider myself an opera expert, so I don't claim to have fully analyzed the problem, but I would identify two areas:

Except for Zancanaro as Count di Luna, the principals cannot act. Fiorenza Cossotto as Azucena is especially a disappointment: she has two major gestures in her scene with Manrico: arms crossed over her chest, and hands stretched to her mouth. The revelation to Manrico that he is not her real son passes without any dramatic action.

Secondly, then we have direction: I am amazed to read that Brian Large did the TV direction. Well, I guess everyone has a bad night now and then. In the scene where (I believe, the Count's) soldiers march off the stage, I almost laughed out loud. You would think you were watching some 9th grade high school thespians. It was wooden and unimaginative.

I have watched it twice, and don't plan to watch it again. Anyone want a copy cheap? If not, save your money for a high-quality audio version, and enjoy the wonderful Verdi tunes--with your eyes shut or open, as you see fit.",1186012800,9,1353,4.648535564853557
2289350,4,B0009GV9CS,"I would give the main singers the following ratings:

Bonisolli - A++

Cossotto - A++

Zancanaro - A

Plowright - B

Bonisolli's singing is thrilling - his 'Pira' is so perfect, you could die for it - the audience loves it, so they go through it a second time.  Bonisolli looks quite handsome in this video.  His acting is blustery and he basically stomps around the stage and makes sweeping motions with his arms - exactly what you expect from a great tenor - it works!  Zancanaro does the same and it seems to work fine for him too.

Cossotto's singing is also terrific with her fierce chest notes.  She holds one of those low notes a super long time and the audience is ecstatic.  Her acting is a little over the top but it also works - she seems very committed to the role.

Zancanaro sings a tiny bit blustery.  On a couple of the ensembles his lack of agility is quite noticeable, but all in all, he sings well.  He has very pleasing, rock-solid high notes.

Plowright is way too pushed at the top.  She also runs completely out of breath and gets behind during the Act 1 cabaletta.  She makes me feel she was really always a mezzo, not a soprano.  Her pleasant voice, pleasant stage presence, good acting, and good diction make up for some of the lack though.

The Ferrando was fine but nothing to write home about.

It's worth it for Bonisolli and Cossotto in my opinion.",1149984000,20,1379,4.375494071146245
2289351,5,B0009GV9CS,"It is a large-scale production.
The camera focuses at the beginning on the audiance to illustrate how many people are there.
It is open-air and still a very good sound quality.
Perhaps due to the singers.

The cast is very strong, in the virtuosic aspects:
Bonisolli does not posses the prettiest of voices, but his technique is electrifying, and I enjoyed his Manrico very much.
Zancanaro has a great voice; I have him also singing in Butterfly and Don Carlo and he is terrific.
Plowright sings and acts well, although she missed the high C at the end of act one (Bonisolli backed her up).

What is special about this dvd is having Fiorenza Cossotto.
Yes, there are many available recordings of her in that role, but this is her last (as far as I'm aware of).
She is still in full control of the range and dynamics - she hits the high B flat with no difficulty.
Plus, her experinece as Azucena is vast and it is shown.
Her quality of voice is less refined than it used to be - most apparent is the heavy vibrato, but that fits the part.
She has always sounded too high, and she still does, but at least she sounds old ;)

The conducting is no more than conventional, but it's not necessarily a bad thing.

Buy this for Cossotto's most mature Azucena!",1145750400,15,1251,4.402597402597403
2289352,5,B0009GV9CS,"Ya tenamos un Trovatore excelente con Domingo, Cossotto, Cappuccilli y Kabaivanska, ahora tenemos dos. Realmente recomiendo a los amantes de esta pera tener ambas versiones ya que las dos brillan a gran altura.

La puesta en escena de esta versin en la arena de Verona es de gran belleza y originalidad. El vestuario variado y elegante resulta muy adecuado para la ambientacin del tema. La orquesta y el coro bajo la direccin de Reynald Giovaninetti hacen una entrega de gran profesionalismo y contundencia.

Los cuatro solistas principales cantan en gran forma. Partiendo por la atractiva Rosalind Plowrihgt cuya voz, de gran belleza, fluye con mucha armona logrando impresionar en cada rea, cabaletta y conjuntos tanto por su volumen como por su color. Adems demuestra excelentes condiciones histrinicas. Todo lo anterior la hacen, a mi juicio, la mejor intrprete de Leonora desde la Callas. Otro tanto se puede decir del magnfico desempeo de Franco Bonisolli, quien nos muestra una voz brillante y segura, como asimismo una generosa entrega, configurando un Manrico apasionado y herico. Fiorenza Cossotto, que se repite en ambas versiones, nuevamente est esplndida mostrando la potencia de su instrumento y cantando con un pathos que emociona. Giorgio Zancanaro, qu gran bartono es, est en la plenitud de su voz y entrega un Conde de Luna firme y vengativo. Tambin en este caso quisiera referirme a la belleza de timbre y color  de su voz. Todo lo anterior hacen de esta versin una opcin imprescindible para los amantes de la pera verdiana. De Zancanaro y Cossotto tenemos muchas grabaciones pero, uno se pregunta por qu de Plowright y Bonosolli hay tan pocas? Sera maravilloso que las casas editoras  pudieran entregarnos otras peras cantadas por ellos para satifaccin de los amantes del arte opertico.",1131926400,9,1806,5.15358361774744
8060281,5,B0009GV9CS,"Beautiful version of this opera, I bought it for Cossotto, the mezzo.  The soprano is good too, and the tenor excellent, very satisfied.",1454976000,,136,4.913043478260869
8060282,5,B0009GV9CS,"An older production, but the best. I love the tenors taking a bow and doing an encore right in the middle of the opera. Only in Verona.",1425686400,,135,4.037037037037037
8060283,5,B0009GV9CS,"Sometimes an opera can be pure fun. Here's a great example.

This is an older recording so don't expect HD. It's a standard 4:3. The singing is good, not great. There are times the tempi seems rushed. Some of the staging is a bit confusing---the opening scene made me laugh out-loud as this giant....errr, battering ram...heads toward the audience and we're riding it in.

All that and 5 stars? You bet! Some operas are just sheer fun. The audience is exuberant and it's contagious. It reminds me of what it must have been like in the 1800s. People applaud and ""bravo!"" every aria. It's really fun.

Il Trovatore is a weird opera anyway but it's packed with great music. Enjoy this ""NASCAR"" version! Get in there and cheer, boo, hiss and BRAVO!

Get the DVD for the sheer pleasure of opera.",1415750400,,790,4.581560283687943

8060285,5,B0009GV9CS,"very dramatic andrather dark, the whole opera seems to take place at night a rather sad sto0r7y line but worth wathing",1357171200,,118,4.666666666666667
8060286,5,B0009GV9CS,"And has any NEW production's cast managed to outshine THIS one?
The answer is plainly 'no'!
The leads are simply mesmerising - even though you may claim that Bonisolli's Manrico isn't as 'gentle' and sophisticated as Placido Domingo's, still, his singing and his physic more than made up for any deficiency of his acting 'here'.  He was plainly the best Manrico of his time, and he isn't surpassed in the present century.
I disagree adamantly that the rather unsophisticated direction in this production mars the visual image in any significant sense.  After all, the performance was made in the Arena di Verona, not the Metropolitan or Covent Garden.  It was a much more spacious venue, and the actions of the characters on stage could not be too fine-tuned.  Sometimes, less action is better than more in such setting.
Zancanaro is a sterling Count di Luna, if not the vocally best.  He acts with conviction, sings reasonably well though not in a truly distinguished voice, and he has the aristocratic demeanour for this role.  Cossotto's Verdian mezzo-soprano fits the role of Azucena to a 'T'.
Bonisolli is simply the best Manrico since Corelli - he has the right timbre and looks, though I would not say that his performance here is his absolute best (even so, enough to oust others!).
Rosalind Plowright is by far the BEST Leonora I have ever seen - she looks the part, sings the part and owns the part.  Her timbre is beautifully colored, with just the right amount of 'push' for a lyrical and tragic role as this. Her singing is very refined 99 per cent of the time in this performance. Her acting is also wonderful.
Sorry, even Karajan and Domingo's version did not manage to outshine THIS one, for the lack of an authentic Manrico.",1346544000,4,1741,4.745033112582782
8060287,3,B0009GV9CS,Having just seen the MET version and listened to the 1962 Price/Corelli version this is mediocre. Il Trovatore is perhaps the most beautiful opera ever written. The Price/Corelli version even in mono will make your hair stand up it is so spine tingling in depth of emotion and vocal brilliance. In this Australian version there is no staging but a single chair and lighting. A disappointment.,1306368000,2,392,4.954545454545454
8060288,5,B0009GV9CS,Joan Sutherland is magnificent. If only she were still singing today. The recorded performance is as good as it gets.,1303171200,4,117,4.9
8060289,5,B0009GV9CS,"Kultur has just released nine DVD's featuring Joan Sutherland. This one is a jewel. The first thing that impressed me was how well scenery, lighting, costuming, and stage/video direction, created from this live performance, recorded in 1983, a superb video experience, There is little that does not come through the television screen as made for that medium. Quite an achievement and quite an impact on the viewer. As to that which comes through so well, it is superb. Every featured member of the cast sings and acts with skill and feeling,while the orchestra, under Bonynge, provides driving force and strong underpinnings at every stage. No element that matters will disappoint. A proud evening, indeed, for Australian opera and a gratifying one for the viewer,
The performance is sung in Italian with English sub-titles. The picture and sound are fine with ordinary equipment",1248048000,17,879,5.197183098591549
8060290,4,B0009GV9CS,"Superlative singing and acting from everyone, particularly Fiorenza Cossotto, who has the most experience for Azucena's part. There should be a better sound level balance from the orchestra.
As I have said for a similar problem in the last act of the Glyndebourne Festival Opera Marriage of Figaro presentation, opera is a visual as well as a musical art, the scenery is important. This is supposed to be taking place in a castle in Spain, not around scaffolds erected for whatever purpose.",1215475200,6,490,4.987804878048781
