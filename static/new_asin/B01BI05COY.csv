7646827,5,B01BI05COY,"I enjoyed the way this DVD uses CGI of dinosaurs in the story. This show is truly entertaining and educational. It is very colorful and teaches a great deal about dinosaurs and how they live in their environment. We learn all about several species of dinosaurs - Edmontosaurus, Triceratops, Brachiosaurus and Spinosaurus. Trek teaches us about what they eat, how they care for their babies, how their foot prints give paleontologist information about how they lived and more.  It is also quite entertaining in the way Trek's imagination put the dinosaurs into the world now.

 Dino Babies uses great story lines in each episode. I enjoyed the way each episode has a real life familiarity. For example ""Switched at Nest"" tells us how dinos care for not only their young but other species young.  ""Dino Tooth Fairy"" examines the various species teeth. The vocabulary and material are very well suited for the intended age group and they do a great job explaining terms and answering why dinosaurs do the things they do. I enjoyed the introduction of each episode with a situation that causes Trek to work on the solution and, in the process, he uncovers information about dinosaurs that he shares with the audience.<p>We see many positive role models. Trek and his friends demonstrate a friendship and willingness to work together on their school project. They all recognize Trek's expertise when it comes to Dinosaurs.

This is exceptionally well produced. It has excellent options on the menu that are easy to use, allowing you to view all episodes or select a specific chapter.

I definitely give thir 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12. Reviewed by Juanita S., KIDS FIRST! Juror",1462406400,,1696,4.871527777777778

8750277,4,B01BI05COY,"Dino Dan Trek's Adventures: Dino Babies is the newest release in the series. My kids really enjoyed these episodes but did struggle a bit to explain them all clearly. With all the interesting dinosaur names and their excitement from really enjoying the episodes, it can sometimes be a little tricky to catch all the details. However, they do learn quite a bit from this show, and the following is what I was able to take away from their opinions on this DVD release. In the episode Dino Tooth Fairy, Trek has a loose tooth. When he finds a strange tooth on the front porch, he is determined to figure out which one of the dinosaurs in his yard that it belongs to. My boys also really enjoyed the Dino Pals episode in which a new student from Australia shows up at Trek's school. This new boy is obsessed with dinosaurs and shares Trek's unique ability to see them. Naturally, they become instant friends and go on an adventure to find a missing dinosaur bone. I like how most of the episodes put a strong emphasis on teamwork and being a good friend. The series tends to incorporate a lot of problem solving skill in order to make hypotheses and come to conclusions. I feel like these episodes really help kids to develop critical thinking skills, and my kids really enjoy watching them. I would recommend this release to any dinosaur fan who likes a little bit of science mixed with a lot of adventure! This DVD includes eight episodes for an approximate running time of 90 minutes.
