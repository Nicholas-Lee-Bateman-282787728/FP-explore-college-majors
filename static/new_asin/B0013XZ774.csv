3120370,5,B0013XZ774,"GOOD MORNING VIETNAM is an amazing film. It is one of those films that is just so watchable and so endearing. It lingers, yet we return to it. Perhaps, it will end differently this time out. Robin Williams is just so frenetic. His pace and the pace of the film somehow are thrown of kilter by the predictable unpredictability of his mind, his madness that is the only thing really sane in war. I love this film. DEAD POETS SOCIETY too is bittersweet. Robert Sean Leonards performance is just so on mark, just so heartbreaking. Once more we question the motivations of Williams character he portrays. Interesting scores from both Maurice Jarre and Alex North in these two films. They were interesting choices, both Jarre and North.",1388966400,,730,4.755905511811024
3120371,5,B0013XZ774,"These two films have become part of the common culture of this country.  ""Seize the day"" is a philosophy that is not limited to those who studied Latin or went to prep school and ""Good Morning Vietnam"" is a greeting that will forever symbolize the frantic last days of the war in that country.  Each story is enjoyable in its own right but together they are even better and showcase the range of this extraordinary actor.",1383350400,,421,4.526315789473684

Good Morning, Viet Nam is just funny in the beginning.  The famous, ""Good Morning, Viet Nam"" is a classic opening.  The war and its accompanying incidents is a sad commentary of 'no good deed deserves to go unpunished.'",1252713600,,431,4.3375
