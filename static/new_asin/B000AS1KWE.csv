2390982,3,B000AS1KWE,"Having read so many other reviews, all I can say is ""Sit back and enjoy the ride."" This is enjoyable camp to say the least, including a wonderful ""Woe is me"" performance from Tom Baker, later to bring Doctor Who to the cult status it enjoys now. (Rightly so but that's another story).

This is essential viewing if not buying. Choose one but I bet you'll take the other too.

Enjoy!",1139961600,2,382,4.366197183098592
2390983,4,B000AS1KWE,"Is there any more enduring stereotypical character within the horror genre than the mad scientist with altruistic visions of improving the overall lot of mankind?  And they always seem to share the same philosophy of in terms of the `need to break a few eggs to make an omelet', or, the need of the many outweighs the need of the few as an impetus for their actions...The Freakmaker (1973), aka The Mutations, co-written by Edward Mann (Island of Terror, Hot Pants Holiday) and Robert D. Weinbach (Hot Pants Holiday), and directed by Jack Cardiff, whose better know for his cinematography on such films like The African Queen (1951) and Death on the Nile (1978), stars Donald Pleasence (Circus of Horrors, Halloween, Escape from New York) as Professor Nolter, teacher, scientist, and all around first class nutter.  Also appearing is Tom Baker (The Golden Voyage of Sinbad, ""Doctor Who""), Brad Harris (Goliath Against the Giants, King of Kong Island), Julie Ege (The Final Programme, The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires), Scott Antony (Dead Cert), Jill Haworth (The Haunted House of Horror, Tower of Evil), Olga Anthony (Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter), and the diminutive (only in size) Michael Dunn, who played Dr. Miguelito Loveless in the 60s television show ""The Wild Wild West"".

After a brief intro from the director, the film starts proper with about five minutes of footage featuring sped up visuals of plants growing, accompanied by some really odd music.  After this we're in a lecture hall where Professor Nolter is discussing mutations, both of the natural and induced kind, along with providing examples in terms of carnivorous plants (there's an exceptionally strong sense of foreshadowing going on here).  As the class ends, we meet four of the students in Tony (Antony), his girlfriend Lauren (Haworth), Hedi (Ege), and Bridget (Anthony), who splits off from the rest of the group (permanently, as we'll soon see).  Oh look, a wee man (Dunn) is posting ads proclaiming a carnival in town, one featuring a freak show...anyway, Bridget gets abducted by a masked figure and ends up at Professor Nolter's home/laboratory, which includes an assortment of grotesque-looking plant life...he doesn't seem to recognize her (I guess she wasn't a very good student), and Nolter and his facially deformed kidnapper acquaintance, named Lynch (Baker), prepare her for some kind of experiment by taking all her clothes off...homina homina...now we're at the airport as our three, plucky remaining students are picking up a visiting dignitary/researcher named Brian (Harris), who quickly latches on to the sweetmeat Hedi (who could blame him), proving that English girls are, in fact, easy.  Professor Nolter and Brian are colleagues of sorts, and after getting the grand tour of Nolter's lab and accomplishments (where's Bridget?), Brian hooks back up with the gang as they make their way to the carnival, the highlight being the freakshow.  Afterwards, a suspicious Tony returns to the carnival after closing, only to get caught by Lynch, who it turns out, is part owner (along with Burns, played by Dunn).  Seems Lynch and Professor Nolter have some sort of arrangement which I won't reveal, but let's just say the Professor will have a few less term papers to grade this semester...as the Professor continues to get his freak on, quite literally, Brian picks up where Tony left off, provoked by the recent disappearance of Hedi, leading up to a spectacular finale, where everyone gets exactly what they deserve, more or less...

In terms of sleazy exploitation horror/science fiction films, The Freakmaker is a real standout, in my opinion.  The story is fairly solid, although slow going at times, and features a strong subplot (reminiscent of Tod Browning's 1932 film Freaks) with regards to Lynch and his association with his sideshow employees (he doesn't see himself as one of `them') that fits in nicely with the rest of the tale.  Pleasence presents an interesting, Dr. Moreau like character, with a clearly defined vision, even though his methods are highly suspect (at least he gets results).  One thing I did find a little bothersome with his character was that generic European accent (sounded Germanic) he used throughout.  I'm not sure why he didn't just speak in his normal voice, but that's just an aesthetic quibble on my part.  I was intrigued by his theories, and his conceptualization of the ideal organism...why wait for nature to take its course, when one has the ability to induce desired mutations?  There was no contemplation here with regards to ethical questions normally raised as to while one may have the knowledge and ability to do something, but does that mean it should be done?  Damn the consequences, I want my mutants!  I thought Baker also did very well, the drooling, facially deformed antagonist driven by the desire to have something which most take for granted, willing to go to any means to obtain it...there are some decent shocks to be had here, along with some disturbing sequences, all highlighted by one of the more bizarre soundtracks I've heard in awhile, some of it coming off as futuristic flamenco music, but it did work for the material, proving the worth of trying something different.  Overall, for the type for movie this is, I thought the production values decent.  Some of the effects may seem low rent, but that doesn't mean they weren't effective.  Also, a bit of the nekkidness didn't hurt at all (Jill Haworth and Olga Anthony certainly had the goods).  My favorite scene from the film involves Professor Nolter and his casual feeding technique of one of his carnivorous plants, proving plants, unlike felines, aren't very finicky...

This is my first purchase of a Subversive Cinema release, and I have to say, I'm very impressed.  I got a feeling here that the people who put this DVD together are fans of the film (and films in general), given the overall quality involved, and appreciate the value and potential of the DVD format.  The anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) looks clean, although some of the colors do seem saturated, but, given the film hasn't been available in any format for the last 25 years, I got over it...there are four audio tracks, including the original mono, a stereo version, and two commentary tracks, one featuring the director Jack Cardiff, and another with producer/writer Robert D. Weinbach and actor Brad Harris.  The well thought out extras include extensive bios, a still gallery, a featurette titled `The Freakmaker' (26:04), reproductions of three lobby cards, a decent sized replica of an original theatrical poster for the film, and a hidden feature allowing one to access an alternate credit sequence.  There are also trailers, one for this film, along with other Subversive DVD releases (or soon to be released) like Blue Murder (1995), The Candy Snatchers (1973), Battlefield Baseball (2003), The Gardner (1975) aka Seeds of Evil, and Metal Skin (1994).  Given the amount of attention given to this odd, cinematic curio, I'm looking forward to more releases from Subversive, as they seem to know how to do it right.

2390986,4,B000AS1KWE,"Although it had hints of the classic movie ""Freaks"", it was a more modern take and I never saw it before. Sure it was a little corny at times, but still creepy in it's own right. Don't mess with mother nature!",1363564800,,209,4.121951219512195
2390987,2,B000AS1KWE,"The movie is okay as long as it remains within the boundaries of being an homage to Tod Brownings ""Freaks."" However, when it slides into the territory of mutated half-human-half plants, with the mandatory topless heroine in distress, then it simply becomes ridiculous. It's hard to believe that it was directed by Jack Cardiff (Sons And Lovers), better known for his stunning cinematography in the classic Black Narcissus.

2390988,5,B000AS1KWE,"THE FREAKMAKER is the touching tale of a mad scientist named Norter (Donald Pleasence from RAW MEAT, HALLOWEEN 1 and 2, ALONE IN THE DARK) who is determined to create a human / plant hybrid (!!). This means that a few people must disappear, winding up on Norter's laboratory table. Meanwhile, a freak-show thrives next door, w/ a steady supply of new and unusual attractions. Tom Baker is great as Norter's henchman, Lynch. This cries out to be watched as part of a double-feature w/ its contemporary, spiritual twin, SSSSSS! Wondrously weird!...",1361145600,3,546,4.945652173913044
2390989,5,B000AS1KWE,"I primarily bought this movie because it features Tom Baker (Dr. Who) as the disfigured villain. Even under all the makeup, you can tell it is classic Tom Baker under the slouch-hat. If you are upset by sideshow freaks, do not get this movie, as that is much of the theme and the setting. One wonderful surprise is getting to see Michael Dunn on-screen again. I so enjoyed his performance as the nefarious genius - Dr. Miguelito Lovelace - on ""The WIld Wild West"". He died a year after this film was made.

The plot centers around the mad-scientist (Donald Pleasence), his deformed partner (Tom Baker) who is helping the doctor in hopes of having his deformity ""cured"" by the Dr's wild experiments. The Dr. is trying to cross plants with humans to make us stronger and more able to cope with life in the future. Many wonderful time-lapse films of plants are included as part of the intro and as part of the experiments.

Side note: It must have been really, really cold when they were filming this movie. Even in the scenes that seem to be filmed indoors, you can see the actor's breath condensing in the chill.

A MUST for any serious sci-fi collection ---- especially if you like British sci-fi and in particular - Tom Baker.",1359244800,,1227,4.568181818181818

2390991,4,B000AS1KWE,"Somebody found a time laps camera for this film and made a movie around it. Freak meets girl, Doctor turns girl into plant. A movie like this couldn't be made today because of the exploitation of the handicapped, which I fully support. All in all it was an ok movie even though I hope I have better friends than the ones that were abducted, missing for a week and no one comes looking. I did enjoy the fact that the police weren't contacted since most movies just have the cops thinking they are crazy are that they were the killers.
I do recommend this movie for all you classic horror fans.
There is lots of skin, bad acting, clueless characters and mostly shot at night. Have fun with this one.",1355875200,3,697,4.369230769230769
2390992,4,B000AS1KWE,"I first saw this movie in the early 1970s at the Belmont Drive-In in Greenville SC under its original and much better title of THE MUTATIONS. Imagine an updated color version of Tod Browning's FREAKS that borrows its principal plot device from H. G. Wells' THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU. Add more than a touch of David Cronenberg style body horror (three years before Cronenberg's first movie) then combine it with the unmistakable look of the British horror films of the time and that will give you some idea of this unique and periodically disturbing film. I had not yet seen the Tod Browning film so the idea of sympathetic carnival oddities was new to me. I did, however, know the plot of DR MOREAU from the 1932 film ISLAND OF LOST SOULS with Charles Laughton one of the creepiest films to come out of the 1930s.

Donald Pleasance nicely underplays the quintessential mad doctor who wishes to create a race of biologically superior life forms that combines elements of both plants and animals. The experiments that don't quite work out wind up as sideshow attractions at a local carnival headed up by a pre-DOCTOR WHO Tom Baker looking for all the world like a tall version of John Hurt's ELEPHANT MAN and dwarf actor Michael Dunn only a few years removed from THE WILD WILD WEST. The rest of the cast of young British talent and a somewhat stiff hero played by Brad Harris fufill their roles in the necessary manner for this type of film which is basically a B movie with a pedigree. That pedigree is director Jack Cardiff, one of the world's greatest cinematographers and an occasional director of fascinating films (THE LONG SHIPS, DARK OF THE SUN, SONS AND LOVERS). His knack for interesting visuals makes this movie a hard one to forget. If only they had kept the original title.",1300406400,6,1784,4.6455696202531644
2390993,4,B000AS1KWE,"Known by another name in the UK this is a gloriously mish mash of Browings ""The Freaks"" remade in the early 70's. It can't be rated higher but is still worth a look with some of the daftest monsters ever and enough nudity and flared trousers to make up for the plot holes.

8079308,3,B000AS1KWE,"Having Donald Pleasance and Tom Baker together in the same movie was pretty good, though their relationship together was a typical Dr. Frankenstein and Igor dynamic. I've heard this movie once was originally called Mutations,which would have been more appropriate than Freakmaker, but I guess they changed it to that since it was going with the movie Freaks near the end. Over all the movie was okay! This is your typical cheesy exploitation film with real sideshow performers in the cast and that guy from Blake's 7 turning into a plant monster. Not a real classic, but anybody who likes monster movies should really give this one a shot.",1500681600,,639,4.871559633027523

8079311,5,B000AS1KWE,"In 1932 Tod Browning brought the fantastic, Freaks to life. In 1972 Jack Cardiff brought us The Mutations (now re-titled The Freakmaker). The Freakmaker wasn't a big hit at the time but it was fairly controversial-for the same reason 1932's Freaks was controversial. The film features people with real deformities just like Browning's film did. While the film is essentially a retelling of that film, it does bring its own plot elements into the retold story.

PLOT: Donald Pleasance (of Halloween fame) plays a scientist/professor who works at a college and secretly in the carnival. He's obsessed with plants and conducts wild experiments/research. Aiding him in his research is the terribly deformed-Lynch (played by Dr. Who's Tom Baker). Lynch works with doctor because he's made a promise to perform surgery on Lynch to make him 'normal'. So, Lynch abducts locals (mainly from the college) for the twisted experimentation. The doctor takes people and through various 'surgeries' turns them into plant-human hybrids similar to the humanimals in The Island of Dr. Moreau. They're then put on display as sideshow attractions in the carnival. In Lynch's spare time he terrorizes the other carnies and visits hookers. However, the vanishing college kids catches the attention of their friends and the police. Meanwhile the carnival folk begin to turn on their oppressor...

THE FILM: The Freakmaker garnered a decent sized cult following and is considered a cult classic. It was written by Edward Mann and Robert Weinbach. It features the talents of Donald Pleasance, Tom Baker, Brad Harris, Michael Dunn, and Jill Halworth. The film features music by Basil Kirchin and Jack Nathan. Nolter was originally written to be played by Vincent Price.

REVIEW: The Freakmaker features strong performances, rich color schemes, decent characters, decent writing, great special effects, beautiful musical score, and tight direction. The story is fairly interesting; it combines both elements of Frankenstein and Freaks in a unique way. I found most of the characters to be fairly well written, however most of the college kid characters were fairly uninteresting. The film centers mainly on Lynch, who's the most well written/developed and interesting characters. He's tragic yet cruel in that he's torn between being 'normal' and being a 'freak'. There are times when he's nice to his fellow carny companions and other times when he's down right viscous. Dr. Nolter is essentially just another mad scientist however Pleasance plays the character in such subtle/calm-collective manner that the character is pretty intriguing. The other characters are a little underdeveloped but still engaging. The effects for the time aren't too ad and the final man-plant is very cool. I love the film's musical score and beautiful visuals. My only real problem with it as that the big finale is a little abrupt. SPOILERS............................
Lynch's death scene is fantastic but after that what happens is way too fast and undermines Nolter's overall menace. So his escaped plant man makes his way back into Nolter's lab, grabs Nolter- during the struggle they knock over a few bottles which causes a fire. Then the building burns, THE END. Although it seems like that would ruin the rest of the movie, it actually doesn't but the ending is still okay, it just could've been better. Other than that I thought The Freakmaker was one of he best horror films of the 70s, It's definitely one of my favorites of all time. It's paced fairly well and is pretty cool.

HOME VIDEO: The Freakmaker made it's way onto DVD a couple times. Once by Desert Island Classics and by Cinema Classics. But a definitive release came out in 2005 by Subversive Cinema. It has also been released on VHS several times.

8079314,3,B000AS1KWE,"The nice thing about some of these old horror flicks is they feature quality actors and at least were created by professionals, even if they seem corny, have no CG for special effects, and so on. Based on that expectation,  only 3 stars because the plot involved circus freaks largely played by circus freaks. While there is one good scene of conflict between the freaks, in general I prefer real life be left out of it. Particularly in bad taste were excerpts of a real freak show. On the positive side, we have a mad scientist doing a great service to mankind while in actuality committing horrific atrocities involving attractive young people -- a horror archetype at polar opposites to the sociopath, retard, or demonic force of evil, not used enough anymore.",1405123200,,763,4.78030303030303
