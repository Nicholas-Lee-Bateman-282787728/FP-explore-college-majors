8332604,5,B001P9G3B0,"I purchased this for use in a class I teach on gender and sexuality in the Middle East (though the content of the film goes further afield).  It is a good, highly personal documentary.  My students enjoy it and so do I.  I'm not sure I would want it to be someone's base for ""knowing"" about the issue, but it certainly does a good job of humanizing it and thinking seriously about issues of repression, faith, and ""being oneself.""  I plan to watch it with students again and to share it with my wife one evening as well.  It's a lovely film.",1510704000,,541,4.264705882352941

8332607,3,B001P9G3B0,"Having been raised in Turkey.  I feel utterly disappointed in this production.  It supposedly highlights human rights issues in some locales he had been at. and shares some stories that are news, like celebration of two historical male lovers.  Yet while giving more depth and footage to gay stories, it manages to treat lesbian stories as insubstantial.
It is done as a way to allow him communicate his religious convictions and devotion, which to my observations amount to subjecting women to invisibility.  While building tension around male characters' safety.  I have personally known the lesbian characters from Turkey, and how he endangered their safety.
 He glorifies male sexual prowess, as the discussion between one main gay character and supposedly a religious leader, focus on sexual aspect, totally discounting the love, platonic angle of his attraction to men.  This character was depicted as a father.  Yet so called humorous conversation between him and his children, had only shown how the culture would make light of death stonings.  That shows me how shallow his convictions to human rights are.

Yes he highlights how devoted gay/lesbian children are to their parents, correction to their mother.
He manages to bring about internal conflict of male characters between their faith and their love orientation.  For women characters, he depicts them in the way he believes they can be part of an Islamic community, behind veils, behind burkas, devoid of personality, as 2nd class citizens.  We saw the gay men characters as human beings.  He failed to extend the same courtesy to lesbians.  As so called religious faith of women come from middle age conviction that their visibility will seduce men.  So they must be rendered invisible.
He failed to depict locales of characters in their essence.  His religious faith and male entitlement perspective fail to  communicate the full essence of those locales.
Ah we need a documentary that would talk about A Jihad for Equality, for Justice in the very same locales.",1404950400,,2031,5.162079510703364
8332608,4,B001P9G3B0,"A good documentary and overview of queer Muslim individuals.  Parts can be difficult to watch due to the content - it's not physically graphic, but can make you emotional if the topic is close to you, personally.",1386288000,,212,4.72972972972973

Intentionally or not, by letting on sexual discrimination grounds such different culturally newcomers in rather rich with a mirage of opportunities contemporary, developed, civilized etc places of ""non-believers"", a very controversial issue had been popped up.

In general. this work initiated a positive impression of Muslims not short of any common ""mortal sins"", according to clergy overwhelmingly, a same gender attraction surely is.",1300752000,3,686,6.061855670103093
8332610,4,B001P9G3B0,"It was interesting to see how gays and lesbians in prominently Muslim countries view themselves and their religion. A Jihad For Love does not just focus on gay men as many studies, reports and documentaries but also gives us a view into what life is like for lesbian Muslims. However, I have two problems with the film. The first being the lack of depth for the people in the film. We see people in the park but very little information about who they are, where they comes from and the react from friends and family. Also the camera work at times was out of focus and very shaky. It will be interesting to see where the subjects are and if they have found inner peace in a few years.",1284854400,4,683,4.3023255813953485
8332611,5,B001P9G3B0,"A Jihad for Love showcases the plight and suffering of the gay and lesbian community in countries where Islam is practiced; the laws of Islam dictate that homosexuality is illegal, immoral and sick and that gay people should (or at least could) even be stoned to death for their ""sins!"" The film is an excellent documentary that lets us meet several gay and lesbian people, some in relationships and others not, who must struggle to reconcile their Islamic faith with their being gay or lesbian. Some of them are expatriates and others still live in Islamic countries and chose to hide their faces for fear of retribution from the local police and other legal authorities. I truly felt that I knew these people by the time the film ended and the bonus features helped me even more to understand their struggle and the situation for gay and lesbian Muslims, even in our country. In addition, the cinematography is excellent and the film moves along at a good pace; it moves neither too slowly nor too quickly and the interviews with these gay and lesbian people make them stand out as human beings with rights and that's terrific.

The film essentially consists of interviews with gay and lesbian Muslims; they all bravely and honestly tell their stories in such a way that it's impossible not to empathize with them and their struggle. One interesting situation is that of a lesbian couple who live apart in separate countries, getting together from time to time yet, at least for one of them, unable to accept that being Muslim and being homosexual can go together. We also see how one man received one hundred lashes for being gay. Another brave soul, who was married and has visitation rights with his children, explores his children's feelings about homosexuality and the results are powerful and moving at once. We also see (in one of the bonus features) a relatively new organization of gay and lesbian Muslims in the United States where they are respected more and are able to organize more openly than in other countries.

Overall, I highly recommend this film for anyone studying gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender issues. It does fall somewhat short of discussing transgender issues but it's still a good film; at least we do see how one man dresses up as a woman to essentially belly dance in a Parisian restaurant. This is also an enlightening film for anyone who wants to understand the religion of Islam as it relates to homosexuality and its other religious laws in general.",1276732800,4,2492,4.806526806526806
8332612,5,B001P9G3B0,Thank God the secrets are out!  Tolerance and do no harm!  What we fear and disagree with seems to be what we fear may become true in ourselves or forced upon us.  May God help us to tolerate each others differences  as we try to harm none.  None of us are perfect or superior.  Death makes us all equal and memory is gone!,1247616000,2,323,4.0476190476190474
8332613,5,B001P9G3B0,"Director Parvez Sharma spent more than five years traveling throughout the Muslim world and interviewing lesbians and gay men about their life, their faith and their fears as followers of Islam.  The results are enlightening, heart rendering and, at times, shocking.  Like the documentary about gay people in the Orthodox Jewish world, Trembling Before G-D, A Jihad For Love restricts itself to the paradox of religious followers of a faith that seemingly rejects their existence.  Of course, the penalty for homosexuality is far more severe in countries ruled by Sharia law, but it is amazing to see and learn how the faithful deal with what must seem like overwhelming obstacles in simple things that gay people in the Western world take for granted.

I learned quite a bit from this film that I was previously unaware of, such as the fact that Turkey, although overwhelmingly Muslim, has no laws forbidding homosexuality, and attitudes there concerning homosexuality have always been more relaxed than other parts of the Muslim world.  I also was under the false impression, as many Westerners are, that jihad means ""Holy war"".  It actually means ""struggle"".  Thus the film's title is quite apt, and because the film's creator / director is himself a member of the Muslim faith, the film exudes an aura of self-assured confidence, familiarity and respect for its subject matter that many documentaries cannot hope to achieve.  In modern Pakistan, of all places, the Sufi sect celebrates the love of a 16th century poet and Sufi saint, Shah Hussain, for a Brahmin boy named Madho Lal.  Each year on his urs (death anniversary) their love is celebrated through ritual dances held in the shrine near the tomb of the two lovers.  The scenes of Muslims dancing and celebrating this love are jarring, and totally at odds with what many in the West have come to expect from the Muslim world.

One of the most striking things about this documentary is how Mr. Sharma managed to get the men and women interviewed in the film to openly talk about themselves, although most of their faces are not shown.  Even though a gay Muslim himself, it must have been very difficult to gain their trust.  More striking still is the devotion to their religion that these people still have, and one contrast with Western culture is how close they still are to their parents, and how accepting their fundamentalist parents seem to be, despite the cultural and religious taboos against same-sex love.  That is to say, many of the gay people profiled in the film are still close to their families, whereas in Fundamentalist Christian families, many gay children are rejected by their parents completely.  There is even a wonderful segment where a Turkish lesbian brings her partner to meet her mother.

There is also a scene where a South African Muslim confronts an Imam, and tells him that the verse in the Qur'an which condemns homosexuality (there is only one, outside of the story of Sodom & Gomorrah) is open to interpretation.  The Imam responds that the only portion of Muslim law about homosexuality that is open to interpretation is the severity of the punishment to be inflicted.  Such complete close-mindedness will not surprise anyone who has ever tried to argue gay rights with a Christian fundamentalist.  It has long been my understanding that one of the most severe problems with homosexuality and Islam is that the Muslim religion has no central leadership, in that almost anyone who is a member of Islam can study to be an Imam and so become a spiritual leader and recognized as an authority on the Muslim religion and what it teaches.  As such, many of the leaders of the Islam faith are those who are most fundamental in their interpretation, although the term Imam itself differs completely depending on whether one is a Sunni or a Shiite, the two largest sects in Islam.  This documentary is extremely eye-opening, shedding light on what heretofore has only been a shadowy world of isolation and self-hate.  It is sure to engender discussion among Westerners, and may even result in some dialogue within the Muslim world.  And at least that's a start.  Highly recommended.",1240704000,21,4171,4.917261055634808
