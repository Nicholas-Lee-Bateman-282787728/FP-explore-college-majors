Father O'Malley arrives at the parish and learns the previous pastor had been taken away to ""Shady Rest"". [The lighting tells you this is a stage set.] He meets Sister Superior Benedict and the other nuns of the parish school. Earthly honors and rewards are not for them; they do God's work. The children recite the Pledge in the new fashion, hand over heart. The school has no playground; they had to sell it to raise money for repairs to the school. [The Great Depression.] Mr. Bogardus tells Father O'Malley that he wants their school; if they don't sell the Town Council will condemn it (eminent domain or zoning). A woman arranges for her daughter to be boarded at school; she needs special help. A new boy gets into trouble. What is the proper way to handle interpersonal conflicts? The Sisters visit a sporting goods store (remember them?) to gain knowledge on a non-scholastic subject. [Note the firearms on open display.] Father O'Malley helps a young girl with her homework.

Young Patricia's essay hints at help from an adult. Young Eddie has profited from his extra-curricular education. The Christmas play put on by first-graders shows elegant simplicity. Mr. Bogardus explains his need for their school property - his workers need parking for their cars (a comment on the return of prosperity). The Sisters tell Mr. Bogardus that they want him to donate his new building to their school! [The war time shortages of materials like glass are referenced.] The stress is harming Mr. Bogardus. A long-lost husband is reunited with his wife, and we hear another song. There is a question of school policy as to passing students who are not academic high performers. What is the purpose of schooling? Isn't it a means to an end, not an end in itself?

Mr. Bogardus suddenly turns over a new leaf, and donates his building to St. Mary's! It's a miracle. The doctor has bad news: Sister Benedict has TB in an early stage. [This diagnosis was often a death sentence before the antibiotic cure of the 1950s.] She must be sent away for a rest cure, but she cannot be told why (to keep her spirits up and effect a cure). Patsy meets he reunited parents, and things will be different. Patsy graduates to move on to High School. [In earlier times those who finished Grammar School went to work at age 14; their education continued in the workplace.] Was life really so simple in those times? Ingrid Bergman shows her acting ability as Sister Benedict.

I remember another reason to explain Mr. Bogardus' generosity. His plant was land-locked, even if he got a new parking lot. But if he was able to buy a large property outside of town he would have more than enough space and lower taxes too. No traffic problems either. An elderly widow could no longer work her farm. So Father O'Malley arranged a deal that was a win for all concerned. The availability of plentiful food has put an end to TB in America. From about 1860 to 1950 it was the major cause of death in America. Did we end up with an epidemic of obesity in turn? Its better to die of a heart attack or diabetes at 60 than of TB at 30.
