8158836,5,B000KRN6B8,Loved this DVD. Loved seeing Kasey away from NASCAR back to his roots. Nice to see him so relaxed and glimpsing his life prior to his fame. One review said that they were mad that there wasn't more racing but who cares. You wouldn't be able to see Kasey if it was more racing as he would be in the car w/ a helmet covering his darling face.,1313884800,,340,4.014705882352941
8158837,5,B000KRN6B8,"I like this DVD because it's not the same old thing you see....48 hours with KK puts you right in his shoes-  autograph session- drifting, sprint car and even buds with tony stewart.....I totally dig this dvd and recommend it !!",1180396800,,228,4.560975609756097
8158838,1,B000KRN6B8,"First off, the box says that Kasey races Tony Stewart for charity, but that doesn't even happen. Tony races in one race that Kasey isn't in and wrecks, so they don't race each other.

Second, the dvd is only 50 min long and about 40 or 45 of that is people talking about nothing at all. What they ate for dinner, what's good on tv, just whatever comes out of their mouth like it wasn't edited at all

Third, there is almost no racing footage and what there is, is terrible. Extreme close ups of one car so you can't even see the race, just retarded stuff like that

Fourth, and this is the really bad one, the audio is terrible. You literally cannot understand at least half of the words spoken on this dvd, and there are no subtitles

Don't waste your time or money on this, buy something else.",1179878400,3,795,4.245033112582782
