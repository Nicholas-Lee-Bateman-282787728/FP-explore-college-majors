8048724,5,B0007LXOMS,"Ok, we all know that this is a totally amazing show and this DVD does not disappoint!!  It's all action and amazing story lines.  If you loved anything about the 2003 TMNT version, then you HAVE TO GET THIS DVD!!  And, don't be nervous about getting this particular DVD ""Words Collide"" that has the cover art with Splinter at the top left corner, April at the top right corner, and Ralph in the center.  I'm saying this because here on Amazon it states that the language is in Japanese with English subtitles - this information is completely inaccurate.  THE LANGUAGE IS IN ENGLISH!!  And if you are reading this review now, then you have guessed correctly that this DVD is out of print.  I took a chance and bought it used here on Amazon because I wanted this DVD so badly.  The type of used DVD I got was ""Used - in very good condition.""  I suggest then if you don't have this DVD and want it, then get it used here - but get one that is in ""used in good condition.""  Well, good luck fellow fans in compiling this amazing collection!!  This 2003 version of TMNT is the best version out of the 3 that they have done so far when compared to the 1987, 2003, and 2012 versions.  And not only that, but this 2003 TMNT is the BEST ANIMATED SERIES EVER MADE!!!",1408752000,2,1255,4.271186440677966

8048727,5,B0007LXOMS,"Worlds Collide is a three-parter that takes place after the Space Invaders three-parter which can be purchused in Ways of the Warrior 3.1  Weary of the war between the Federation and the Triceratons, the Fugitoid arrives on Earth.  He believes that he is the cause of all the bloodshed since both sides want him to build a teleportal device.  So he decides to give himself up so all the carnage may cease.  But the turtles can't bare to see their friend sacrifice himself so they try to put a stop to it.  But the action heats up when Agent Bishop finally emerges from the shadows, putting his own schemes in to motion.  So the turtles will have to protect the Fugitoid from baddies on several fronts.  One way or the other, the conflict is about to come to an end.

  This dvd also includes Touch and Go.  In this episode, two super powered French speaking bounty hunters are hired to take out the turtles.  And in New Blood, Saki aka the Shredder uses his vast fortune to begin rebuilding New York city after the events of the Triceraton invasion.  The public, unaware of Saki's true face, believes that he's assisting the citizens.  But he's really after something else entirely.  For a large amount of alien technology has been left over after the attack, and in Shredder's eyes, its ripe for the picking.  But why and for what purpose?  C'mon, you'd think I'd spoil the rest of this season for you?  Not my style.  These are five of the best episodes season three has to offer.  So pick this one up.",1146960000,3,1504,4.5
