I have just ordered and viewed this film and I'm so excited about it I want to share it with my friends.  When I looked up the film I did see the sole customer review from Ms. Wagner and was puzzled for a moment, until I realized she must have thought she was getting the Hollywood movie with Jimmy Stewart.  One can understand her mistake -- Lindbergh sure does look like a film star, and she may be too young to remember Jimmy Stewart.  Ordering can be so confusing, and it isn't Meet Me In St. Louis either!  Seriously though, this sounds like something to be worked out with the sellers for a refund or exchange, since this was not what she thought she ordered, fair enough.

I thought this film was excellent and true to its genre, which is travel documentary, a tag that can be misleading in the case of Mr. Williams's films which are consistently more than a cut above the others in that niche. This one is especially good in my opinion, because there are some personal touches that make it truly a blend of past, present and future.  It won't spoil you for other films about Lindbergh:  if you haven't seen any it will whet your appetite, and if you have seen them all I think you are still in for a pleasant surprise.",1430265600,,1278,4.291666666666667
