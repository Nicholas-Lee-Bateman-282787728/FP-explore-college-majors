165681,5,0800114051,"The others are right, five stars is NOT enough for this magic, Amazon really ought to have six stars available for those VERY few truly exceptional films. This is definately one of them!  I only wish that I could go back in time and see it for the first time all over again.  Perfect.",971740800,3,284,4.2407407407407405
165682,4,0800114051,"While this doesn't feel as timeless or as compelling as Capra's other films, it is a lot of fun. A very young James Stewart and Jean Arthur shine, but Lionel Barrymore steals the show as the crusty old grandfather  of an eccentric family. As with almost all Capra films, the business man is  the 'bad guy', and the happy family that believes in good old-fashion  American values and aren't afraid to forget about everything else and do  'what they like to do' are the 'good guys'. It feels very stagy, but it  does have it's funny moments, and Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur make a  dangerously cute couple. An entertaining slice of Americana by Mr. Capra.  From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!",961286400,8,699,4.456692913385827
165683,5,0800114051,"Jean Arthur and Jimmy Stewart are terrific in this screwball classic about the trials and tribulations of a VERY eccentric family during the depression. Edward Arnold and Lionel Barrymore are tremendous and even  though the picture has dated notions, they only seem to add to the movie's  charm as a whole. Director Capra had reached his creative genius by 1938  (The FIRST director to have his name above the credits, this genius almost  singlehandedly kept Columbia Pictures financially sound.) Jean Arthur made  her first film, a silent in 1923! she had to wait an incredible 12 years  before her comedic gifts were finally recognized by Hollywood. Never as  young as  audiences assumed, she was born in 1901 and was 37 in this comedy  classic which was voted by the Academy as the Best Picture of 1938. A  delightful diversion in the screwball genre!",946857600,62,854,4.909090909090909
165684,5,0800114051,"This is one of the Capra films I always had on my list, but never seemed to get around to seeing.  My family took me to see it one year on my birthday and since then I have made every close friend, roommate, and lover  see it.  Watching Jean Arthur in this film is a joy unrivaled in my  opinion.  The scene with her and Jimmy Stewart, in the posh restaurant is  side-splittingly funny!  This film also permits the viewer to see Stewart  in a softer, subtler role than he usually inhabits in Capra's films.  I  fell head-over-heels in love with both Arthur and Stewart after seeing this  film.  If you don't see this, you're really missing out.",939340800,12,644,4.364406779661017

165733,2,0800114051,"Best picture award of 1938 --  hard to believe. Two hours and six minutes of talky, noisy Capra corn and not very funny by any standards.  Also hard to believe its being a play by George S. Kaufman, considering his penchant for wit.  Lionel Barrymore -- so much better in David Copperfield and Grand Hotel.  Likewise James Stewart -- better in ""The Spirit of St. Louis"" or any Hitchcock film in which he appeared.",1510444800,,413,4.54054054054054

165737,5,0800114051,They don't make movies like the classics anymore.  I love the story and the ups and downs. I laughed out loud many times. This movie has real substance and meaning that movies don't have anymore.  Definitely worth owning and watching every year. A great lesson in being a good human.,1508544000,2,283,4.64
165738,5,0800114051,"Sure, it is a little corny at times and also completely unrealistic: none of the main plot points stand up to any kind of scrutiny.

But then again, neither do Marvel movies. So, this movie paints an idealized picture of the ""heroes"", which in this movie are ""moral heroes"" and not gunslingers or superheroes.

And there's something refreshing about that. These kinds of movies are fantastic fairy tales without CGI.

This is a fun, family-friendly movie with a morality tale about money and power and fame versus family and friends. There are some delightful moments of humor, and the message is one that is relevant for all time. Yes, it is ham-fisted at times -- but also a lot of fun with likable characters.

Highly recommended, especially as a rental.",1507248000,,757,4.8
165739,2,0800114051,"Just rewatched this charming 1938 movie. Why didn't its racism strike me before? It's about a nonconformist household where everybody does only what makes them happy. The house is run by a Black maid and her husband who happily cook, serve, clean, haul, fix, wipe, and chauffeur for the whites as if that's their dream life, everything they (being Black) ever dreamed of doing. And at the end, as everybody prepares to move to a new house, the couple--the only ones in the house who do any work at all-- are heard to say they sho' hope there's welfare available at the new place.

This film is as bad as pornography. I'm embarrassed I didn't realize this years ago. Thank you, Black Lives Matter, for opening my eyes.",1506816000,,717,4.6015625
165740,5,0800114051,"My Daddy loves this movie, and I FINALLY found the right one. Not a bad price, either, considering the movie and who it is, how old it is, and how well it works. Not a scratch!",1506470400,,176,3.9166666666666665

165742,5,0800114051,"A classic with Jean Arthur of the daughter of a madly eccentric father guided by paterfamilias Lionel Barrymore in one of his best roles. She falls in love with James Stewart, the scion of a rich and powerful and very stuffy family, but can their romance survive their very different families? One of the best screwball comedies.",1506038400,2,329,4.7894736842105265
165743,3,0800114051,"Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold) is closing the real estate deal of the century. All he needs to complete this is a small plot of land. Unfortunately the eccentric Martin Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore) that lives there won't sell. This is back in the days that there was no right of domain for private construction.

Anthony's son Tony (James Stewart) the vice president falls in love with his cutie stenographer Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur.) Sort of a ""Drama and Greg"" thing. And just like Drama and Greg all the members of her family seems a tad touched and preoccupied with doing their own thing.

By now you have guest it the stenographer is the grand daughter of the eccentric hold-out. The fun begins when the two families meet and exchanges different philosophies. There are lots of fire works. Than a trap is sprung, netting the lot of them. During the sorting out process we get many long speeches.

How will it all end?
Do we learn anything in the process?
So we may come to the conclusion that ""You Can't Take It With You"" then again?

Based on plays by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart you can see an overwhelming over ride by Director Frank Capra.

Some of the same actors turn up in another Capra film ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946).

165779,5,0800114051,"The cheery, upbeat tale of a proudly bohemian family and their efforts to find common ground with the snooty, stuffed-shirt parents of a future son-in-law. I don't usually go for such brash, in-your-face optimism, but something about this ragtag group of merry, welcoming, open-hearted characters really struck a chord. Though it brims with loud personality - new faces pile in by the fistful each time we visit the house - there's a shocking level of character development at play here. That can be partially attributed to its roots in theater, and the associated volumes of dialog that are breathlessly peppered in, but I think just as much credit must go to the actors, who commit wholeheartedly to their roles (no matter how silly) and smoothly grant fast, earnest credibility. Stereotypes abound in the plot, from the sinister banker looking to tear down a merry little village to the happy-go-lucky grandpa who's always got the perfect sentimental speech prepared, but that legitimacy of character (plus the film's age) makes it all feel like a natural fit. And really, don't some themes ring eternal? A true classic that warms the heart and reminds us to slow down and ensure we're still getting all we want from life.",1485216000,,1225,4.980487804878049

165792,5,0800114051,"I read the play, and I loved it. I laughed the entire time. It was raunchy, it was silly, and it was so funny. Then I found out about the movie version. Silly me, I didn't know it was watered down. The first time I saw it I liked it and the second I loved it. Alice Sycamore is in love with a boy named Tony and they want to get married. His family is straight laced and slightly uptight. Hers, on the other hand, is hilarious and sweetly free-spirited. Her grandfather goes to graduation ceremonies because it's fun, her mother writes plays all day, her sister cant dance but dances for the love of it, and her father makes fireworks. Their house is often noisy and crowded with people doing whatever they love. Money is worth very little in her family and with his, it's everything. As you can imagine, the families clash. You immediately love Alice's family. Sure, they're a bit kooky, but they do what they love and they don't care what anyone else thinks. They have fun all day, and Alice is a wonderful girl with a wonderful sense of humor thanks to them. Her grandfather is a sweet, good man who just wants people to be happy. You can't take it with you, he tells people, which is very true. Everyone loves grandpa, from the family to the neighbors, and what I love is how the neighbors help grandpa when he needs them the most. It's a very funny movie about a very funny, very loving family with a very sweet ending",1478217600,3,1423,4.333333333333333

As movie tend to drop into formulas all too familiar these days its nice to go back once in a while and watch something from the past, something that after all these years seems fresher than many movies being made today. And for my money if you want to find a movie that will make you laugh and think at the same time there is no better movies than those made by director Frank Capra. So when I heard that this was coming out in a special edition I was pleased as punch.

Based on the play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, the story revolves around a unique family to say the least. Led by patriarch Martin Vanderhoff (Lionel Barrymore), a man who walked away from work years ago to enjoy life, the household has a number of offbeat characters living there. Among them are his daughter Penny Sycamore (Spring Byington) whos been working on a novel for years, her husband Paul (Samuel S. Hinds) who is in the midst of creating fireworks, their daughter Essie (Ann Miller) who dreams of being a ballerina, her husband Ed (Dub Taylor) who distributes Essies candy she makes and wants to play the xylophone and Alice (Jean Arthur), the most apparently normal one of the group. This is a house filled with what some might call misfits but in truth are a group of people doing what they enjoy rather than what they must as designated by society.

As the story opens businessman Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold) is trying to buy out a 12 block area of the city in hopes of tearing it all down to build a munitions factory for the government, a deal which will make him richer than he already is. The only hold out so far is Mr. Vanderhoff though Kirby isn't aware of him by name.

At the same time Kirbys son Tony (Jimmy Stewart) has fallen in love with his secretary and her with him. What no one is aware of is that his secretary is none other than Alice. Tonys snobbish mother is unhappy with his choice of girlfriend seeing as how the young girl isn't a member of high society. Before Alice is willing to accept Tonys proposal she invites him to bring his family to meet the future in-laws. Unfortunately Tony brings them the night before they are scheduled which starts a ball rolling that results in some hilarious moments as well as problems for all involved.

The end result is a movie that not only flicks at your funny bone but touches your heart as well. And that was the thing with most Capra films, they didn't feel fake or phony but felt real like these were people you could meet while walking down the street. They might be a bit eccentric but they had principles and ideals, they wanted the best out of life and did what they could to achieve that. The wealthy are portrayed not so much as evil as misguided, in pursuit of something the might never achieve which is the happiness that those far lower on the rungs of society find on a daily basis. In the end what you come away with is an understanding that money might help at times but it isn't the be all to end all.

What I love about Capras films as well is the performances he gets from everyone in a film. For me a great performance isn't one that goes over the top, one that you sit marveling at the performance being given. To me a great performance is one where I honestly believe the people I am watching are those characters they are performing as. Barrymore comes off as the kindly grandpa here who wants nothing more than for the government to leave him alone, for big business to go elsewhere and for his family and neighbors to be happy and content. Stewart is believable as a young man in love willing to chuck it all for her. Arnold once again is the stuffed shirt who lightens up eventually. And Capras fall back star Jean Arthur presents herself as a woman in love who adores her family but knows they aren't what most people call normal at the same time.

The movie is a joy to watch and one that stand the test of repeat viewings. I think Ive seen it at least a half dozen times now and each time I find myself laughing, rooting for the underdog and getting choked up at moments that were planned out for me to do so. While many tagged his films as Capra-corn for me they will forever hold a place in my heart. With few exceptions he never made a movie that isn't worth watching more than once. This movie not only deserves a place in your heart but one on your shelf as well.

Extras include a short documentary interview with Frank Capra Jr. and more.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Director Frank Capra was a superstar Hollywood director in the 1930s. He had a string of critically-acclaimed and successful pictures after joining Columbia Pictures and elevating the studio from poverty row to a force that competed with the big leagues. Two of Frank Capras Columbia movies won the Oscar for Best Picture, and Frank Capra became the first filmmaker to win the Oscar for Best Director three times, all within five years. You Cant Take It With You was Frank Capras second Best Picture winner and his third Best Director achievement.

Sometimes his films have been called Capra-corn, because they are usually steeped in Americana, explore themes of social class inequality, feature casts of eccentric, but lovable protagonists and greedy, heartless villains, and contain stories about the Everymans struggle against the Establishment. Frank Capra was also one of the developers of the screwball comedy, in which mismatched couples, usually from different social classes, fall in and out and back in love.

You Cant Take It With You was based on the Broadway play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, which was still playing in New York when the film opened. Its a story with Frank Capras classic oddball characters and this time a whole family of them and their clash with the moneybags banking world, which was a hot topic in the Depression-weary 1930s.

Grandpa Martin Vanderhof [Lionel Barrymore] is the patriarch of a  poor but extremely happy freedom-loving houseful of misfits that include his daughter Penelope ""Penny"" Sycamore [Spring Byington]  as a pulp writer and painter, and her husband Paul Sycamore [Samuel S. Hinds] who is a maker of fireworks, his granddaughter Essie Carmichael [Ann Miller] as a would-be ballerina taking lessons from a mad  Russian instructor Potap Kolenkhov [ Mischa Auer] and her husband Ed Carmichael [Dub Taylor] as a vibraphone player and  printer, a couple of other hangers-on who create things in the basement Poppins [Donald Meek] and DePinna [Halliwell Hobbes], and the obligatory comic African-American maid and butler Rheba [Lillian Yarbo] and Donald [Eddie Rochester Anderson]. Oh, and then theres the other granddaughter, Alice Sycamore [Jean Arthur],  who is relatively normal and works as a secretary in the big bank building owned and run by Anthony P. Kirby [Edward Arnold], who  wants to buy Grandpas house and land so that he can develop on it. Grandpa is the only holdout in the area and refuses to sell. The complication comes when Alice Sycamore and Anthony P. Kirbys son Tony Kirby [James Stewart] in his first major role and first for Frank Capra and falls in love and want to marry. Socialite Mrs. Meriam Kirby [Mary Forbes] disapproves with such viciousness that she practically becomes the real villain of the piece.

Thus, the Frank Capra ingredients are all there, odd and funny characters, a conflict between upper and lower classes, and a screwball romance. Add in a healthy dose of Americana songs like Polly Wolly Doodle and you have a classic that in many ways still resonates today as a cautionary tale of greed. As the title states, you cant take your money with you when you're gone, so you might as well have fun and not worry about it while you're here on earth.

The performances are first rate all, and the adaptation by Robert Riskin is superb, despite radical changes to the third act of the play. There are some very funny moments, such as when the Kirbys come to the Vanderhof home for dinner on the wrong night, causing the nutty household to spring into action to accommodate them. Familiar-face Harry Davenport has a wonderful comic turn as a night court judge when everyone is thrown into the drunk tank for disorderly conduct and illegal manufacture of fireworks.

And yet, of Frank Capras most well-known pictures of the 1930s was It Happened One Night; Mr. Deeds Goes to Town; Lost Horizon; Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and this one, You Cant Take It With You is perhaps the weakest. The problem is that it is slightly too long, at times ponderous, and it takes a while to get going. I do question whether or not it really was the Best Picture of 1938 and other nominees such as The Adventures of Robin Hood, Grand Illusion and Boys Town may have been more deserving. Though other films in Frank Capra's repertoire have eclipsed it over the years, its simple yet important themes continue to strike a chord, and its earnest, winning performances enhance the story's underlying warmth. Many who watch it might detect a hint of old fashioned home spun philosophy, but for the most part, this engaging, often goofy, and occasionally sentimental ensemble piece is honest, straightforward, and wise...all hallmarks of one of the finest directors of Hollywood's Golden Age.

Finally, in the Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook you have the Frank Capras forward from the 1938 souvenir programme, where he quotes:

When I saw the George S. Kaufman-Moss Hart stage play, You Cant Take It With You, I was convinced that here is one of the finest comedy-dramas of our time  a great idea told through comedy.

Any story or play with universal appeal, with a theme that reaches into the hearts and minds of humanity, makes for great screen entertainment.

These fundamental qualities are present in an unusual degree in You Cant Take It With You. That is why I believe the picturization of this delightful story will have widespread appeal to everyone everywhere.  Frank Capra

Which sums up the film 100% and especially as it is a Frank Capra film, that always has magical image quality and one of the best directors to come out of America, as his films are always a joy to watch and makes you want to actually meet the characters in the real life and shake their hands and say, well done, you was totally enthralling and entertaining, and you deserve all the plaudits for your performance in this film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment brings us this classic film You Cant Take It With You that has been digitally restored and remastered in 4K and offered up on Blu-ray in an encoded 1080p image that looks quite remarkable given the 1938 vintage of the film. Source damage is minimal, and while the grain structure does look quite coarse, it is organic and filmic. The Black-and-White photography looks striking, with strong contrast and only the slightest hint of crush in some of the blacks. The restorative efforts have delivered elements that are largely free of any major cases of damage, and aside from some very minor wobbliness at some transition points, which I assume may be ""joins"" between the various sources, and there are no other issues of image instability. According to the liner notes, the 4K restoration of 'You Can't Take It With You' ""proved to be a complicated mix and match of sources"" due to the film's horrible state of disrepair and lack of any original camera negative. Moments of softness come and go, and - typical of the time - close-ups flaunt a diffused gauzy quality, but considering what the restorers had to work with, this is quite an admirable effort that rightfully honours this Oscar-winning film.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment brings us this classic film You Cant Take It With You in the original monaural soundtrack sounds about as good as it can for a recording from 1938 in this 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio track on Blu-ray. It is basically clean and free from excessive noise, and is very intelligible. While obviously unable to overcome the technological limitations of the original recording, the track is decently clear, with good prioritisation. Strangely enough, 'You Can't Take It With You' received an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound Recording, despite the fact that aside from an explosive fireworks sequence in the film, it contains few showy sonic moments. The dynamic range is limited and there's not much resonance to the track, but it serves the material well and does its job without incident.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Frank Capra, Jr. and Author Cathrine Kellison: The director's son, Frank Capra, Jr., delivered an astute and engrossing commentary for Sony's 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' release a year ago, but he and cohort Cathrine Kellison drop the ball here, providing a dreadfully dull, uninspired track that's only rarely enlivened by a few choice anecdotes and observations. The pair spends too much time watching and reacting to the action on screen and their incessant laughter wears thin very quickly, and merely scratches the surface regarding production details, cast and crew biographies, and narrative themes. Frank Capra, Jr. sprinkles in a few colourful stories and the best of which focuses on the adversarial relationship between his dad and Columbia studio chief Harry Cohn, quotes from his father's writings, and cites some differences between the play and its film adaptation, but Frank Capra, Jr. and Cathrine Kellison struggle to sustain listener interest over the course of this two-hour-plus film. But despite this situation, there is some other interesting information about this film from Frank Capra, Jr. and Author Cathrine Kellison, like they point out that the name of Frank Capras name is above the title of the film and they talk about the composer Dimitri Tiomkin who Frank Capra, Jr. tells us that he use to visit their home regular and found his strong Russian accent very amusing. We are also informed when we first see Jimmy Stewart, that he was a very young 30 year old in this film, who originally was training to be an architecture  and his Father had a hardware store and was contemplating to go back and work in his Fathers store, but of course fate propelled him into a very prominent actor. We find out that in the original Broadway play, there were only 19 characters that appear throughout the play, but in the film, Frank Capra had it extended to over 153 character actors. We also find out that Lionel Barrymore had crippling arthritis, that is why his character is always with crutches, which was brought into the story line, but over time his arthritis got even worse with his follow up film, he had to play out his character in a wheelchair. We also find out that Ann Miller was only 14 years of age in this film, but told the studio that she was 18 years of age. With the main scenes in the lounge, if you look carefully you will see dotted around all the walls only have photos of Jean Arthur, which is not really explained why this was. They talk about Jean Arthur who was known to be paralysed with stage fright, but in this film you see her look so comfortable, but unbeknown to us is that Jean Arthur would always throw up in her dressing room before appearing on the film set, so to calm her down, Frank Capra would work on her beforehand to boost her confidence, which seem to calm her down, but deep down jean Arthur felt that she was not a very good actress. At one point in the film when Jimmy Stewart and his Parents arrive without warning to the house, but instead of talking about this part in the film, Frank Capra, Jr. decides to ramble on about something I have mentioned in the next special feature, where Frank Capra had a falling out with Harry Cohen and Frank Capra, Jr. just goes on and on to total boredom and does like the sound of his own voice, and should of stuck to talking about unknown facts about the film. Despite this little bit of boredom it was quite an interesting audio commentary and they both sure make out they love the film. Their remarks most of the tie are well intentioned and appropriately reverent, but the lack of some sort of focus at times and also the lack of further information regarding the film and their sort of enthusiasm makes this track only a meagre 50% success, still it is entirely up to you to decide whether you fancy hearing their ramblings and agree with the information I have informed you, as their remarks are well intentioned and appropriately reverent, but definitely lacks any kind of focus, and if they were still at school, their report would say, they could do better.

Special Feature: Frank Capra, Jr. Remembers . . . You Cant Take It With You [2006] [1080i] [1.78:1] [25:42] This breezy yet intimate special feature begins with Frank Capra, Jr. recalling his parents taking a trip to Europe and especially England and when he visited the London office, and found out his name was linked with a film that was a total flop and his name splashed all over the cinema posters and other printed material advertising the film If You Could Only Cook and was seething with anger. So immediately flew back to Hollywood to berate Harry Cohen, especially informing what he did was wrong and wanted his contract with them cancelled, but was warned it would be a breach of his contract and wanted a lawsuit between his father Frank Capra and Columbia Pictures, but with a total bluff from both sides, eventually Harry Cohen caved in and visited Frank Capra in his home to eat humble pie, and in doing so  resulted in the studio acquiring the rights to 'You Can't Take It With You' and for Frank Capra to start working on this film. It then covers such topics as the film's themes, the casting of James Stewart, and how director Frank Capra opened up the George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart 1936 play, balanced comedy with meaning and messages, and paid close attention to small details and minor character actors. Though it concludes with a seemingly irrelevant and funny anecdote about Frank Capra's affinity for tennis, in thinking he was the best, especially with one particular tennis match, where unknown to him, he was duped into playing a game with a well know professional French tennis player, which people in the crowd knew of this situation, in the end of course Frank Capra found out about the joke and had a good laugh about it. All in all this is a worthwhile piece that reflects on the humour and humanity that distinguish Frank Capra's best works. We also get contributions from Richard Pea [Associate Professor of Film at Columbia University] and Jeanine Basinger [Curator of the Frank Capra Archives, Wesleyan University]. But what was nice is right at the end, we get a nice dedication that reads as follows:

And of course, a very special thank you to Frank Capra, Jr. His good-natured flexibility, prodigious memory, grace, dignity, and humour are at the core of this project. Mr. Capras quiet devotion to and respect for his fathers life and work continue to keep the Capra flame and name burning bright.

Theatrical Trailer [1938] [1080p] [1.37:1] [1:00] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film YOU CANT TAKE IT WITH YOU. More of a teaser than a trailer, this preview also includes snippets from previous Frank Capra's successes, which includes excerpts from It Happened One Night; Mr. Deeds Goes To Town and Lost Horizon, and premieres what a genius Frank Capra was as a director.

BONUS: This beautiful collectible Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook Blu-ray packaging contains a thorough essay entitled The Making of YOU CANT TAKE IT WITH YOU by Jeremy Arnold. You also get extensive Key Credit Film Lists of James Stewart; Jean Arthur; Lionel Barrymore and Frank Capra. You also get information on the restoration of YOU CANT TAKE IT WITH YOU in 4K by Grover Crisp. Plus load of beautiful black-and-white production stills and extensive credits information.

Finally, YOU CANT TAKE IT WITH YOU is a beautiful timeless classic film filled with laughs and humour that is still relevant today. The running social commentary on wealth and class disparities is far from subtle, but certainly in tune with the day. It is also a lovely piece of escapist fare, an amusing screwball comedy with a bit of serious subtext which seems simplistic by todays standards and informed specifically by the period in which it transpires. Bottom line, its a must for all cinephiles fans, especially Frank Capra fans, like me, also any Jimmy Stewart enthusiasts, and lovers of glorious Black-and-White films. The film contains wonderful performances from a cast that includes bubbly Jean Arthur and James Stewart as her drawling fianc, and also a vast comic talent on display from all the other characters in the film. If you haven't seen it, then make a point of catching this Frank Capra classic, as it is a joy to behold and will entrance you forever, as I think it is a totally brilliant film and a great honour to have it in my ever increasing Frank Capra Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

Felt like a long movie.  Overall, I really liked it.  Great cast.  Interesting to see very young faces of actors that would go on to do bigger things.  The biggest surprise was one of my all-time favorite character actors in his FIRST role -- Dub Taylor -- who went on to appearing in one of my favorite films, Bonnie & Clyde (now there is a film I should watch this week).  Also noticed the IRS agent, played by actor Charles Lane, who would go on to being a big character actor in many 60s sitcoms.  Finally, another familiar face that I had to look up --  to find that actress Spring Byington would become villain, J. Pauline Spaghetti in a Batman episode.

The Blu-ray looked very good.  It had plenty of grain but still fairly detailed.  I know that the film went through an extensive restoration and that it wasn't in great shape.  To take that all into account, You Can't Take It With You looks quite good.

We're holding out for Meet John Doe!

I lost my job in Sales 3 days after Christmas. I came home and told my wife. We were scared and didn't know what our future held with us and our two young children. For whatever reason we decided to watch this film that same night. Both of us had never seen it. To our surprise, and nothing short of inspiration, the film dived right into how we need to follow our dreams. It made both of us realize the potential that had been stunted over the years in doing what we wanted to do as careers. Losing the job was honestly a blessing in disguise. This movie was seriously a cherry on top!

165882,5,0800114051,"You Cant Take It With You was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director. Based on the hit Kaufman-Hart play, the story follows Tony Kirby (James Stewart), a young man from a family of wealthy snobs who becomes engaged to a girl, Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur), from a good-natured but eccentric family. The film contrasts blissful, creative liberty with the strictures of wealth, status and ambition.

Calm, soft-spoken, easy-going Tony is the son of wealthy banker Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold), who is planning to buy out a local neighborhood and gentrify it, putting many families out on the street in the process. All that stands in his way is a single property owned by Alices grandfather, Martin Vanderhoff (Lionel Barrymore), whose home houses a collection of inventors, musicians, dancers, and artists. His daughter, Penny (Spring Byington) pounds away on her typewriter; granddaughter Essie (Ann Miller) twirls to the beat of a xylophone played by her husband, Ed (Dub Taylor); and Pennys husband, Paul (Samuel S. Hinds), sets off fireworks in the basement. When the two families finally meet, chaos ensues. Director Frank Capra paces the action of this screwball comedy at breakneck speed with considerable slapstick, while keeping the themes of social responsibility and individualism in the forefront.

Available for the first time on Blu-ray, You Cant Take It With You is digitally restored and comes with 24-page Digibook packaging featuring rare photos and a new essay by film historian Jeremy Arnold. Bonus extras include commentary by Frank Capra, Jr., the featurette Frank Capra, Jr. Remembers You Cant Take It With You, and the original theatrical trailer.",1450224000,,1723,5.239130434782608
165883,5,0800114051,"As I post this review here on Amazon there are 321 reviews already posted here (!) and they go back as far as 2000  15 years ago!  Though the new RESTORED version was not released until last week (December 2015). That is because Amazon has a policy of combining ALL releases of a film (even VHS ones!) together and posts on ALL versions. I ALWAYS recommend that potential buyers sort by the Most recent review first and then look at the VERSION (VHS/DVD/Streaming/BD) that the reviewer is discussing. Thats very important in this case.

I won't go into discussing the plot or the acting. This is a classic film and you can get that info from other reviews. But I will say that  even though it was made in 1938 (and won BEST PICTURE and Best Director Oscars)  the story is just as timely today with investment and real estate moguls buying up properties for speculation.

Until a few years ago  when ORIGINAL nitrate 35 mm prints of two of Director Frank Capras films were discovered in a shed on his former property  prints of the film were less than optimal. It took years of digital editing and scanning to create this new print  and it looks great. (younger viewers should be aware that it is in Black and white and in 4:3 screen aspect ratio, so you will have black bars on left and right of TV screen.  The film runs 126 minutes.

There bonuses here are enjoyable but not new. Both the informative 25 minute featurette with Frank Capra JR is from the 2005 release as is the feature length commentary. But if you have the earlier version and truly LOVE this film, you might want to upgrade. If buying for first time, youll want the 2015 version. It comes in a small hardbound book with an essay on the film, 2 pages about the restoration and lots of photos.
And there are subtitles in 22 (you read that right!) languages (including Swedish, Hindi, Turkish and three dialects of Spanish). Talk about universal!

This is a true classic and Sony gave it the 5 star treatment!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

165884,5,0800114051,"I'm usually not very big on editions of a film with extra content. Simply put, my main concern is always the movie and there's few I give big hoots about extra/bonus features. It's rare supplemental material matters at all.

For once though, I'm really glad.

The new Blu-ray release of Frank Capra's You Can't Take It With you has a nice book case with supplemental data. Covering well the relationship between the film and the play and how it came to be. I never realized how big a success both were back in the 1930s. Frank Capra's work is some of the good stuff among classic films, IMHO.

Something that I never knew was how hard it's been to get a good cut of the film. Not so much luck with the archival copies, including what the library of congress has on file. Apparently, someone finally smashed open a locked room on the late Capra's ranch and found a bunch of old films. Only bits of two were recoverable, You Can't Take It With You was one of them. The work on the new 4K master helped net us the best copy of the film...when so many great films, the originals are gone, lost to history and we're fortunate to even be able to watch some of them today in any form.

I've written about the film numerous times over the years because it's one of my favorites. It's crazy. it's fun. It's beautiful. You should watch it. I suggest the shiny new Blu-ray or flipping on TCM when it's on.",1449532800,19,1394,4.329501915708812
165885,4,0800114051,"This is one of the finest plays that has ever been produced for the American theater.  It won the Pulitzer Prize in its day.  I've seen many different productions over the years.  As far as I can tell, there are only 3 different versions that have ever been broadcast.  In my humble opinion (or IMHO for the Internet savvy), the movie is a disastrous adaptation.  It loses much of what made the play so amazing and adds plot elements that are far too ""Hollywood"" for the original play.  CBS ran a version in 1977 that starred Art Carney and Jean Stapleton (along with a cast of favorites, including Howard Hesseman as the man from the IRS), but they had to cut it substantially to fit into the commercial space.  Although I prefer many of the cast decisions of the 1977 version, this one is far closer to the original material.  Everyone should watch this play from time to time to remind them what is really important in life.  Note that this is a filmed play and therefore suffers a little in production values as a result.  PLEASE somebody release this version on DVD so that the general public can see it as the authors intended, and not be content with the abomination that is the movie.

Kaufman & Hart's YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU won the 1937 Best Drama Pulitzer; Frank Capra's screen adaptation was honored with Best Picture and Director Oscars. Robert Riskin's movie script generally follows that of the original production, but diverges on a few plot points:

1.) Poppins, the film's toy and mask creator is not in the play. Printer/xylophonist Ed Carmichael was also K&H's maskmaker.

2.) On stage, the actress G&aacute;y Wellington visits the Kirby home to read one of Penny's plays. She drinks too much and passes out. This character was eliminated from the movie.

3.) The play's Grand Duchess Olga Katrina, now a waitress at Childs Restaurant, and her Uncle Sergei (an elevator operator) aren't in the film.

This was the screen debut of Dub Taylor, a character actor often seen in westerns whose 56 year film career ended with MAVERICK (1994), the Mel Gibson/Jodie Foster/Jim Garner comedy. Taylor was chosen for Ed Carmichael because he was a skilled xylophonist. In one classic Johnny Carson Show appearance many years later, Dub astounded the audience by playing the xylophone with three mallets in each hand.

The two-month shoot was not without some suffering. Fifteen-year-old Ann Miller, looking much older as Taylor's would-be ballerina wife, hid from crew and cast that the numerous dance moves required of her were causing severe pain. Lionel Barrymore as family patriarch Martin Vanderhoff, was so disabled by arthritis and a bad hip he needed crutches. Director Capra designed a special foot cast and wrote into the script that Mr. V. had recently injured his leg. Thoughout each workday, Barrymore received injections to ease his suffering.

""You Can't Take It With You"" concerns an extended family of kooks and the romance between Alice Sycamore, its most level-headed member and Tony Kirby, troubled son of an even more miserable wealthy land developer. The elder Kirby is a typical Depression Era movie rich guy: selfish, avaricious and without friends or redeeming qualities. His eventual transition into a human being is as assured as the rocky road that Tony Jr. and Alice will face before their own happy-ever-after ending.

Comedic highlights are the crazy goings-on at Alice's home: random fireworks testing, a trained raven, music and dance on the spur of the moment, her dad posing for a oil portrait as a Roman discus thrower, Martin playing head games with an officious IRS man-- it's a classic screwball comedy celebrating a simple idea: carefree folks who fully enjoy life.

165943,4,0800114051,"F. Scott Fitzgerald is famously (or infamously) noted for having said that the rich, which by that he meant the very rich, the ones who in his day lived in open air mansions and who today we of common clay never see since they are protected from view by about seven layers of security which even the President would envy, are different, very different from you and me. I believe that there was more truth in that statement than he realized and certainly today with all the talk about the income equality gap getting very much skewed it is plain for all to see. Of course not everybody has (had) to buy into that premise even in the Great Depression when everything for lots of people was going to hell in a hand-basket like in the film under review, an adaptation of George S. Kaufman and Moss Harts play You Cant Take It With You. In America the notion of class and class differences has always had a murky existence, always been muted by the roads paved with gold dream, even when those differences are rubbed in our noses every day.

This film is a comic tribute from the master of the genre Frank Capra who plays to that murkiness and presents a counter-position to Fitzgeralds take on class in America. Now during the Great Depression when lifes laughs were few and far between almost everybody could a few laughs at the movie theater and that is what at the comedic level Capra gives us, and even I can agree that such entertainment has its place. As social commentary though especially in the later 1930s when working people were in some very heavy battles to organize themselves into unions and performed other acts of solidarity it runs rather thin even today as archival material.
Heres the skinny on this one and you make up your own mind about what is what about the rich, the very rich:

Young Tony Kirby (played by amiable James Stewart), son of a high-end aggressive big time New York banker who is learning the ropes in his fathers business as a Vice-President in charge of himself apparently, is, well, smitten, with his secretary, Alice (played by Jean Arthur) which already does not bode well for what is to come. See old man Kirby (played in a part that is tailor-made for him by Edward Albert), a ruthless scoundrel out of the old school of cutthroat capitalism where the idea is to grab everything of value not nailed down (and even then give it a shot) has big plans with his cronies to run up a big monopoly on munitions production for what everybody knew was the seconding coming of war to Europe. Not only are old man Kirby and the boys interested in huge profits but also in ruining a fellow munitions maker who needs to expand his operation if he is to survive. Kirby came up with the bright idea to buy up all the land of the people around the competitors operation and freeze him out. Nice work.

The problem is that the whole area had to be purchased or the deal would sink and of course there was one hold-out, Grandpa, Alices Grandpa (played as a jolly wise old ex-capitalist who had seen the light and dropped out of the rat race by Lionel Barrymore), who sees no reason to leave the old homestead for no matter how much filthy lucre. So we get to step two of the problem. Mother and Father Kirby as parents to young Tony Kirby are looking for him to succeed his father after he retires. They are not interested in seeing that derailed by his being taken in by a gold-digging secretary (their take, she is just Americas sweetheart) no good can come of any of this. Ho also just happened to be a granddaughter of the guy who is gumming up the works for old man Kirbys big plans.

But this is where this film as romantic comedy comes in and saves the day. Young Kirby loves his sweetie more than somewhat screwy family and all (and all being related and unrelated hangers-on at the wacky family homestead). So he will not be put off without a serious fight. After several social mishaps Alice comes down firmly on the no go side of the decision that she cannot marry into the Kirby family since they see her (and her family) as beneath them. She takes off for parts unknown. Not good, not good for young Tony and not good for Alices family when Grandpa decides to sell out and find a place for the family near wherever Alice is. At the same time Tony gave the old man the word that he was quitting the rat race business even though it is on the brink of creating the monopoly the old man has dreamed of. That triggers an epiphany in the old man as he realizes that despite his wealth (remembering that he cant take with him) the loss of his sons respect and presence only leaves ashes in his mouth. You can figure out the rest, figure out that a certain secretary from a wacky family is going to be going down some church aisle with a renegade son and with the fathers (and hesitantly the mothers) blessing. See the rich are just like you and me when it comes to family. I don't think this one would have been played that way in lets say a Theater Guild production of the time but for entertainment it is just fine.",1424995200,,5047,4.388888888888889

It is a movie about ""casting your care"" and living in ease and peace; even the family blessings over dinner emulate that.  Just would like to be able to watch it without changing Regions.

165988,5,0800114051,"As apposed to the garbage that is paraded as ""movies"" today.

It was made in a time when decency, morals, manners, chivalry, honor, character and righteousness reigned supreme. A time when Christian beliefs and principals was sewn into the very fabric of the most blessed nation that has every existed.

Sadly, that is ALL gone now. And one of the reasons is: In THIS movie, the ""bad"" guy played by Lionel Barrymore was brought DOWN from his ""Ivory tower of Babel"" and ""Legend in his own mind"" by his own son (Jimmy Stewart).

They don't make movies like that now; because America has sold its soul to satan; so there is NO decency, morals, manners, chivalry, honor, character or righteousness to be found; EXCEPT in a few dwindling places. Thus the arrogant, pompous ""goat"" that a man's son brought down; NOW reigns supreme; including most ""sons"" and ""daughters"" now; across the spectrum of this once mighty bastion of a righteous nation.

For those of you that would love to be taken BACK to a time when ""goodness"" was the norm; and the ""bad"" were rebuked and punished; this is a movie for you.

To go along with that: the video and sound is excellent; AND they did not mess with the original ""aspect"" ratio ""SD"" (4:3) and call it ""HD"" (16:9). Which is another satan led ploy to garner more viewers through sinful subterfuge. Sad indeed.

May Jesus (God Almighty IN the flesh-1Timothy 3:16) have mercy (He will NOT!) on ALL; who flaunt sin in His face; and their blind, gullible, satan-led, Godless liberals; and their blind, satan-led, Godless ""dittoheads""; when He rights ALL wrongs,

Capra was all about the storyline and characters; he definitely wasn't pushing the envelope with revolutionary camera work. Anyhow, this is a charming film for those who are looking for clean entertainment. I wish someone still made movies like this. Please note that this film is in black and white, not color as the cover photo portrays. I watched this video via Amazon Instant Video -- which I like a lot, and I find the quality excellent.

166141,5,0800114051,"Ah, Frank Capra! You gotta love the guy! Remember ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" which you probably saw on TV every year during Christmas? Well, here's another, at least as good. And it also stars Jimmie Stewart, along with Jean Arthur, Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and Spring Byington. It's quite a romp.

Jimmie Stewart is the capitalist's son, and set to become the President of a new, bigger than ever monopoly his father is putting together. The only hold-out in his buying up an entire neighborhood to tear it down for a factory is the kooky Sycamore family. Now, the Sycamores have exactly what I've always wanted: a sort of communal home where everyone does what they like to do, and manages to make enough money doing it to get by. Sort of a precursor to the Hippie communes of my youth. Or what we wanted to be, anyway.

The complication is that Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) and the boss's son are in love. Alice is his secretary, whom his snooty mother discovers him kissing when she visits his office unexpectedly. Alice takes him home to meet her family, who are basically certifiably crazy by most standards. In fact, she's the only one who seems sane at first, although gradually you may come to realize that only the people in that house are sane, and the rest of the world is crazy.

I won't spoil it for you, because you will laugh yourself silly at all the crazy things that happen on the way to humanizing Jimmy Stewart's father, and even give hope to make a human out of his mother (the Russian ballet teacher may be able to loosen her up, it seems).

You gotta watch this in the context of 1938, of course. Both the economic times and the sociological ones, including the servant couple played by Rochester (remember Rochester on the Jack Benny Show?) and a pretty black lady who is cook and general housekeeper and who may or may not be his wife. But it has a similar theme of friendship, and the scene you remember from ""It's a Wonderful Life"" where all those friends take up a collection to help Jimmie Stewart are played out here, as well. Except it's Grandpa Sycamore on the receiving end this time, when he is fined $100 for making fireworks without a license.

I'll give it five stars, in part because I enjoyed it so much, and in part because I want to make the point that it is even better than the other Stewart/Capra movie reviewed earlier.",1337385600,2,2370,4.52803738317757

(One small word of warning, this is not a movie that showcases the tap talents of Ann Miller. One of the best in tap dancing, she spends her screen time attempting ballet and, though she does actually stand on pointe in her pointe shoes, she ""stinks."")

Robards' acting is (as always) superb, believable and a pure pleasure to watch.

I agree with the other reviewers that this is the best version of the play, although if you can't get hold of a copy, the earlier film version directed by Frank Capra, with Lionel Barrymore, James Stewart and Jean Arthur, is definitely worth watching too.

When I was a child, my mother was an English teacher who always had her high school students stage performances of ""You Can't Take It With You."" I was too young in those days to comprehend what the play was about. Then, as an adult in the 1980s, I saw this version of the play, starring Jason Robards, when it was broadcast by PBS, and was immediately smitten! The impact and fun of that viewing are still with me. Inspired, I ended up directing my own high school production of ""You Can't Take It With You.""

This is a feel-good movie about a household of ""eccentric"" characters, Jean Arthur's family, which includes Lionel Barrymore of the great theatrical family, Spring Byington (remember ""December Bride?""), and a very young Ann Miller(purely zany and none of her great tapping).  They have several roomers and pooling resources seems to be the way they all support their belief that everyone should only do what they love to do.  I don't know if that was true for the African-American characters (including Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson who used Jack Benny as his straight man), but it was another era.

Jimmy Stewart, the son of a wealthy and greedy banker (Edward Arnold), falls in love with Jean Arthur (his secretary) and his determination to marry her leads to an amusing and telling clash in social perspective and values.

1.) Poppins, the film's toy and mask creator is not in the play. Printer/xylophonist Ed Carmichael was also K&H's  maskmaker.

2.) On stage, the actress Gy Wellington visits the Kirby home to read one of Penny's plays. She drinks too much and passes out. This character was eliminated from the movie.

3.) The play's Grand Duchess Olga Katrina, now a waitress at Childs Restaurant, and her Uncle Sergei (an elevator operator) aren't in the film.

Taylor was chosen for Ed Carmichael because he was a skilled xylophonist. In one classic Johnny Carson Show appearance many years later, Dub astounded the audience by playing the xylophone with three mallets in each hand.

The two-month shoot was not without some suffering. Fifteen-year-old Ann Miller, looking much older as Taylor's would-be ballerina wife, hid from crew and cast that the numerous dance moves required of her were causing severe pain. Lionel Barrymore as family patriarch Martin Vanderhoff, was so disabled by arthritis and a bad hip he needed crutches. Director Capra designed a special foot cast and wrote into the script that Mr. V. had recently injured his leg. Thoughout each workday, Barrymore received injections to ease his suffering.

""You Can't Take It With You"" concerns an extended family of kooks and the romance between Alice Sycamore, its most level-headed member and Tony Kirby, troubled son of an even more miserable wealthy land developer. The elder Kirby is a typical Depression Era movie rich guy: selfish, avaricious and without friends or redeeming qualities. His eventual transition into a human being is as assured as the rocky road that Tony Jr. and Alice will face before their own happy-ever-after ending.

Comedic highlights are the crazy goings-on at Alice's home: random fireworks testing, a trained raven, music and dance on the spur of the moment, her dad posing for a oil portrait as a Roman discus thrower, Martin playing head games with an officious IRS man-- it's a classic screwball comedy celebrating a simple idea: carefree folks who fully enjoy life.

166167,3,0800114051,"I like Capra a lot.  This, for me, was one of his weakest efforts.  While it has its moments, and a few nicely played performances, the overall feel of the film is underwhelming (and a tad forced) and comes off sloppy as apposed to Capra's more polished and effective works.  In fact, if you took some of his best moments (`Mr. Smith Goes to Washington', `It Happened One Night' and `It's a Wonderful Life') and threw them together into one film you'd have `You Can't Take it With You', a film that should (but rarely does) work.

The overall plot of the film is rather predictable and familiar.  Alice comes from a poorer family than her boyfriend Tony, who happens to be very, very wealthy.  Tony's family is very apposed to his relationship with Alice, but he doesn't care and wants his family to accept Alice and her family for who they are, which just so happens to be a group of eccentric people who put pleasure before responsibility.

Yes, I know that this is a `big business is evil' type film (which is not an uncommon idea for Capra), but it comes off foolish.

The whole idea of Grandpa Martin Vanderfof and his `life philosophies' are really hit or miss.  The idea that one should enjoy his life as apposed to ruining it for wealth is a positive and poignant one, especially when you contrast his character with that of Anthony P. Kirby, his nemesis and polar-opposite.  But, realistically, the Vanderfof clan live a really absurd and pointless existence.  He is painted as a wise and sympathetic man, but he is rather foolish and irresponsible.  That, and it's hard to believe that anything that happens in that house would actually take place.  It's far too, silly.

The film is really a hodgepodge of clich&eacute;s, both society-wise as well as purely Hollywood-wise (every romantic-comedy clich&eacute; is thrown at the audience).

But, there are some highlights here.

For me, this film is about a few central performances that elevate the material.  I love Jean Arthur (I would have given her the Oscar, which she wasn't even nominated for, in 1939 for her brilliant work in `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' over Vivian Leigh) and think she is splendid here, even it she isn't given much to really work with.  Lionel Barrymore, despite having a ridiculous character, makes every scene shine brightly.  The best in show award goes to Edward Arnold though, who manages to give us a believable transformation thanks to his ability to add layers of character development in every scene.  I mean, just the small smile he gives when Penny insults his wife's `hobby' is a beautiful way to give a crack at this man's harsh exterior.

But with the good comes the bad, and performances like that from that horribly stereotyped Russian guy just serve to knock this film down a peg or two (that performance was just gross).

Anyways, like I said, this one is hit or miss.  I liked it in parts, but as a complete package it is not one that I would recommend or care to really watch again.  Loved Arnold though, so see it for that (if you love film and love evaluating performances, I'd recommend you see it just to get a glimpse at a stunning supporting performance).  I give it a C, nothing more, nothing less.",1267401600,2,3216,4.649557522123894

166171,1,0800114051,I love the original stage play. And I love the tv version which stars Jason Robards. Both of these versions are well written and very funny. But the Frank Capra version just tries too hard to be funny and ultimately falls flat. And they changed the stage play beyond belief. Jimmy Stewart's character was built up and the other characters were cut back. The continuity of the story suffered because of that. But the worst aspect of the movie is the overblown effort of all involved to be oh so funny and zany and madcap. It is terribly overdone. I usually like Jimmy Stewart's acting. But not in this movie. I usually like Frank Capra's movies. But not this one.,1255219200,11,662,4.525

166173,5,0800114051,"""You Can't Take It With You"" is the funniest screwball movie ever made.  As funny as it is, the best part is that it is full of heart.

""You Can't Take It With You"" is a delightful family film.  I have always felt that good comedy sets up best when the characters, not the lines, are funny.  This movie is a perfect example of this.

The story is about two families that are poles apart in wealth and lifestyles.  The Kirbys is an affluent high class family that is never satisfied with what they have.  The Sycamores is an eccentric family that does whatever they want in order to be happy.  The members of this family include a mother who keeps writing a book, a daughter who dances all the time and a father trying out experiments in the basement (with explosive results).  These families come together because of a romance between Tony Kirby and Alice Sycamore.  Even though Tony loves Alice's family and thinks they are wonderful-the two are driven apart.

James Stewart, as Tony Kirby, is brilliant.  His comedy timing and mannerisms are perfect.  The interaction between the characters-the situations they find themselves-are so much fun to watch.  Lionel Barrymore as well portrayed the grandfather with heart and passion.

Frank Capra, well known for directing ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and others, did a superb job of bringing this story-originally a play-to the screen.  It is fast-paced, with perfect timing and wonderful to watch.

A great movie to watch as a family and learn an important message.  Regardless of wealth and circumstance, a person is ""rich"" when they have friends and are happy.  Fun and entertaining-this is a gem you will be glad to own.",1253836800,2,1667,4.765734265734266
166174,5,0800114051,"This is a movie version of another successful play on Broadway performed during 1936-1938 season. Frank Capra received the best director award from the Academy in recognition of his superb work, and the film also won in the best movie category.

During the post-depression era, Hollywood was obsessed with making movies that poked at the rich and famous, especially those who lived lavishly through banking and investments in stock market, some of whom were responsible for economic depression, and large scale unemployment that followed. There is a long list of movies casting some of the best from Hollywood, and Jimmy Stewart and Lionel Barrymore are two players who have made such movies. This is a comedy-drama of two families pitted against each other during the post-depression years (1938). One is poor, down to earth eccentric family; and another, a rich family who are concerned about their wealth and social status. Lionel Barrymore offers a brilliant performance as Grandpa Martin Vanderhof, as the head of a poor family, and Jean Arthur offers another splendid performance as his grand daughter Alice Sycamore, who is independent, with her own mind and in love with a rich young man, named Tony Kirby (Jimmy Stewart). Penny does not think much of the differences in their social status, and so is Tony, but when his parents meet Vanderhof's extended family, things turn into a very ugly surprise, and they all end of in jail!

The members of Vanderhof family are a strange bunch of characters with peculiar hobbies and interests. Grandpa Vanderhof doesn't believe in paying income taxes to IRS, and his only daughter, Penny Sycamore (Spring Byington), a lovable, down-to-earth character writes unpublished plays, and her husband Paul Sycamore (Samuel Hinds) experiments with fireworks often with mild explosions: All these consequences taken with a smile and humor! Adorable Ann Miller plays the second grand daughter Essie Carmichael who aspires to be a ballerina, and her husband Ed Carmichael (Dub Taylor) plays xylophone.

When Anthony Kirby (Edward Arnold) buys out dozens of buildings for a new factory in the Vanderhof's neighborhood, Grandpa refuses to sell his home, but later he decides to leave his home. In the mean time, Tony after losing Alice, who is staying her relatives in Connecticut, quits his job at his father's corporation, and Mr. Kirby begins to wonder if his life is really is empty, and if he really has true friends. In the end all ends well after some fine drama in the court.

My favorite scenes in the film are; when Tony proposes to Alice indirectly, when he says, ""Scratch hard enough and you'll find a proposal,"" and when they start dancing with the neighborhood kids and start running when the neighborhood cop shows up. The most hilarious scene is when the house catches fire when fire crackers accidentally ignite, and in the next scene they all will be in jail. George Kaufman and Moss Hart wrote this film, and their fine work was honored with a nod from the Academy during the nominating process in the best writing category. Another interesting story is that during this film, Lionel Barrymore experienced the effects of arthritis and director Capra had his leg put in a cast and made him walk on crutches, which I thought was a nice touch. Screenwriter Robert Riskin also created a new character for the film, Mr. Poppins (Donald Meek), who becomes a permanent house guest of Vanderhof's family after quitting his job at a printing shop, and pursue his dream of making toys and masks. Director Frank Capra is a master of making movies in which a little guy stand up against the big in the society, and eventually win: This is evident in some of his most successful movies. It is also a bit of change in the direction of his cast, because in Capra's wildly successful Christmas classic, It's a wonderful life, Barrymore is the wealthy banker who tries to take advantage of Jimmy Stewart's character during his financial turmoil. It is nice to see Barrymore plays an adorable old man. This film was James Stewart's first and Jean Arthur's second film with Frank Capra. The following year, they would do their second and last film together, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. As all fans know that there is always a powerful message hidden in all Capra movies and the take-home message in this film is that you can't take your wealth with you, but you can always have the love and warmth of a loving family and good friends.

166180,3,0800114051,"I thought ""Frank Capra, James Stewart, Moss Hart, 30's screwball comedy.. It should be terrific.""  Somehow it failed to meet my expectations.

There are some good performances. Stewart was excellent and not too ""aw-shucksy"" as he got in his later days. Lionel Barrymore is engaging as the Patriarch of the unconventional family that provides the comic (and moral) clash with the banking family.  After awhile, though, his charm began to pall a little.  The banker and resident stuffed shirt and bad guy is well played by Edward Arnold who does seem to rescue the character from being a complete cliche.  Poor Ann Miller, who really was a good dancer, was forced to play a silly girl who prances around in her toe shoes to the accompaniment of her husband who plays Chopin on the xylophone.  This is supposed to be really ""zany"" fun stuff.  Likewise the other residents of the ""fun"" house.  Perhaps this really was funny in 1938 but I can't think of anyone over the age of 10 who would be amused by all of the ""hilarious hi-jinks"" nowadays.

Cliche is piled on cliche, with the good-nicks, who are against paying taxes and working for a living are supposed to be our heroes while the banker and his snobby wife are the ones we are supposed to hate.  All the bankers are old, white haired men and the treatment of the Black couple will really make you cringe.  The woman is the servant and her husband is ""on relief"" which is supposed to be really funny, too.  Also he can dance really well.....

There are some funny scenes but a lot of sermonizing....I give it three stars for the good cast and some good performances.",1234828800,4,1618,4.59581881533101

He always seems to find a fresh way of reminding us of the most important things in life - the love and support of family and friends.

Besides, Barrymore is a hoot and a half as the presumptive head of the Sycamore clan. Ann Miller is also delightful as the bat-brained would-be ballerina Essie (it must have been hard for Miller to incorporate awkwardness in her steps as she flits around the house - most of the time she doesn't dance all that badly).

166185,4,0800114051,"""As near as I can see, the only thing you can take with you is the love of your friends.""

The legendarily heartwarming Frank Capra tries out eccentricity for size in the enchanting ""You Can't Take it With You,"" a movie all about doing whatever makes you happy, not rich. While he's not quite in his element here (this is supposed to be really weird? Call Wes Anderson!), the talented cast and heartwarming message make this a truly enchanting, sweet movie.

Megamogul Kirby (Edward Arnold) has bought out dozens of buildings for a new factory -- only one eccentric ""lily of the valley"" family refuse to sell their family house. What he doesn't know is that his dissatisfied son Tony (James Stewart) is madly in love with Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur), the daughter of the family -- who also happens to be his secretary. And now they're engaged, although he hasn't broken the news to his parents yet.

When Tony shows up to meet the future in-laws, he finds ballet in the kitchen, fireworks in the basement, and genial patriarch Grandpa Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore ) ruling the house. But though he loves the way the Vanderhof clan lives, Tony isn't prepared for how his wealthy parents will react to them -- or how they will all be arrested. Wll the Vanderhofs lose their carefree way of life, or will Kirby start to realize that if you can't take it with you, it isn't any good?

Frank Capra tried hard, but he was better at sentimentality than eccentricity. He just doesn't seem to know what a weird family looks like or quite how they'd act, or even HOW weird they should be on a regular daily basis. Capra introduces us to them through a timid clerk who decides ""The die is cast -- I'm a lily!"" and follows Grandpa home so the Vanderhofs can help him explore his ignored creative talents. Before long, he's joined the pack and is happily making fireworks.

What makes this movie -- adapted from George S. Kaufman's stage play -- so enchanting is what Grandpa says in the jail cell: ""You can't take it with you, Mr. Kirby. So what good is it? As near as I can see, the only thing you can take with you is the love of your friends."" That warm'n'fuzzy little message rules the story, where the Vanderhofs devote all their available time to art, food, fun and friendship -- unlike the Biblical lilies of the field, they ""toil a little, spin a little, have a barrel of fun,"" in such a way that it makes you want to join them (even the lady who asks everybody ""Were you ever in a monastery?"").

The film takes a darker turn in the last quarter, when the Vanderhofs appear to be leaving their beloved old house, Tony has lost Alice and soon quits his job at his father's corporation, and Mr. Kirby begins to wonder if his moneyed, powerful life really is empty -- and if he really doesn't have any friends. But don't expect the free-spirited Vanderhofs to be squashed by a corporate president, no matter how powerful he is.

This was the first of Capra's collaborations with James Stewart, and Stewart is a shining bright spot even when he's the most normal one in the house -- albeit not the most eloquent (""Sometimes you're so beautiful it just gags me""). His Tony is unspoiled, sweet, and longs to be part of a loving, wacked-out family. Lionel Barrymore does a stellar performance as the kindly Grandpa, who hides the poignant reason why he will never leave the house, and Edward Arnold is also excellent as a corporate mogul whose preoccupation with money has eclipsed his own happiness.

""You Can't Take It With You"" will leave you longing to become a lily of the valley, and remind you of what is truly important. The eccentricity doesn't fit as it could, but the bright, magical story makes up for that.",1223510400,21,3708,4.557057057057057
166186,2,0800114051,"This 1938 film was a big hit in the years of the Great Depression. It is terribly dated and unfunny today, given a changed culture. It begins on Wall Street when Mr. Kirby arrives at the building that has his name on it. Kirby & Co. will have the biggest monopoly on war munitions after he has bought all the property surrounding a competitor's factory. An early mechanical calculator is shown. The Vanderhoff family do their own thing at their large home. [This must be attractive to the unemployed of that day.] We meet each of them and their personality. [Only in Hollywood?] The culture of that time provides the background. ""Hello, Mother."" Could the son of a millionaire marry his secretary? Does this drama seem dated?

The neighbors are afraid of being forced out as someone is buying up all the land. [No eminent domain then?] Grandpa's house has too many memories for him to leave. What will he get for paying his income tax? ""Not with my money."" Do these activities suggest family insanity or the stress from losing their wealth in the crash? Is ""having fun"" the purpose of life? The scene in the restaurant is interesting and funny. The family's activities are like a circus when the Kirbys arrive. Their dinner will be hot dogs, sauerkraut, and corn! Was there a mistake over dates? The conversation leads nowhere. Then some strange men enter and arrest everyone.

These G-men found literature in a candy box. The fireworks go off, they all go to jail. Can anything else go wrong? There are speeches in the jail that discuss philosophical outlooks. [Do they make sense to you?] The trial in the courtroom provides drama. Grandpa decides its time to move on with his family. A. P. Kirby has triumphed. Ramsay has gone bust, but warns Kirby of a future fate. [Does the ending seem tacked on?]

Can people's problems be solved by making music? Only in a Hollywood movie. The scene at the dinner table looks like a Norman Rockwell painting. Everything that was broken was put back together for the ending. [The scene where everybody puts up money was repeated in ""It's A Wonderful Life"".]",1221609600,5,2097,4.708446866485014

I really do like his other movies. Meet John Doe, Mr. Deeds, Wonderful Life, Happened one night, Arsenic, Mr Smith, etc. All really good, watchable, enjoyable movies.

Then again, as a born again Christian, my world-view has changed dramatically since getting saved, and that may have something to do with my dislike of this picture. (But I recently watched Happened one night,  and I still liked it a lot.)

So I don't know what it is. Maybe its because several of these cast members are more familiar to me in their other Capra movies. Jimmy Stewart is Mr. Smith, or George Baily. Jean Arthur is Clarissa Saunders, and Eddie Arnold is too much like Jim Taylor in Mr. Smith, and D. B. Norton in John Doe. Lionel Barrymore is simply Henry F. Potter, and that's all there is to it! I can't suspend my disbelief at them at all.

Plus, the movie is really weird. I didn't take to the cast of zanies at all, (whereas I usually like Capra's screwballs in his other pictures.) I kept waiting for the movie to get good, and it never did for me. (Several scenes were well done, like the restaurant visit, for one.) But overall, the movie was very tedious for me to watch.

""You Can't Take It With You"" is an absolutely charming and engaging comedy, directed by Frank Capra, that isn't at all dated and definitely will make you smile and think!  They certainly don't make intelligent films like this one anymore.  It is definitely in a class by itself.

Alice (Jean Arthur) is a stenographer for Tony (James Stewart), the son of an affluent and influential banker in their town.  When Tony proposes to Alice, he challenges the barriers of class, social standing and background to be with the woman he loves.  Alice comes from a family of truly distinctive eccentrics.  This includes a ballet dancing sister and her xylophone playing brother-in-law, a grandfather who isn't more content than when he is playing his harmonica and taking pleasure in simpler things.

166198,5,0800114051,"There are two screwball classics of the 1930's which stand out above all the rest, Capra's ""You Can't Take It with You"" and Gregory La Cava's 1936 ""My Man Godfrey"".  Although I love both of them dearly, it's the former 1938 Capra film which has all the magic.

There are plenty of plot synopses here, so I'll just comment in general.  First, the cast could not be better.  Every single actor here takes the art of comedy to new highs.  Some of the staged comedic routines are so complex one wonders how Capra could ever keep track of all the goings-on.  These show just that the brilliant magic of the ensemble can outdo individual efforts.  Not that there aren't standouts here, but, other than Barrymore and Byington, one is hard-put to pick one out over the others.  The ensemble work is perfection.

However, this is a Capra direction.  The script crackles with social commentary.  This carries things forward in spite of the near total lunacy going on around it.  Capra knew what he wanted here and successfully weaves together the two tapestries into a stand-out of the genre.

Forget that Capra changes the Kaufman-Hart play.  That doesn't matter.  If you want to see the play, it's also available on video.  Both stand on their own.  However, this film is a must-see.

166200,2,0800114051,"This ""adaptation"" of the Broadway comedy is way over-written by Frank Capra and turned into a vehicle to showcase Jimmy Stewart.  Perhaps 75% of the play's dialogue is included but is broken up by many long sequences written specifically for Mr. Stewart.

The stage version of this story was mainly about the Sycamore family and their goofy home activities.  Capra has changed the story to focus on the ultra-rich Kirby family and the senior Kirby's relentless quest for wealth and monopoly power.  The scenes devoted to the Kirbys are not at all funny and way over-the-top with populist preaching and anti-capitalist dogma.  While I tend to agree with that part of Mr. Capra's philosophy, especially since this is a Depression era movie,  it really destroys the continuity of the play and makes for some uncomfortable viewing.

If you want to really enjoy ""You Can't Take It With You"", skip this movie and attend a live stage performance.  In addition, the VHS copy has widely variable quality of picture and sound and is mostly not very good.",1165017600,8,1044,4.892045454545454

166205,5,0800114051,"Frank Capra tries out eccentricity for size in the enchanting ""You Can't Take it With You,"" a movie all about doing whatever makes you happy, not rich. While he's not quite in his element here (this is supposed to be really weird?), the talented cast and heartwarming message make this a truly enchanting, sweet movie.

Megamogul Kirby (Edward Arnold) has bought out dozens of buildings for a new factory -- only one eccentric family refuse to sell their family house. What he doesn't know is that his dissatisfied son Tony (James Stewart) is madly in love with Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur), the daughter of the family. And now they're engaged.

When Tony shows up to meet the future in-laws, he finds ballet in the kitchen, fireworks in the basement, and genial patriarch Grandpa Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore ) ruling the house. But though he loves the way the Vanderhof clan lives, Tony isn't prepared for how his wealthy parents will react to them -- or how they will all be arrested. Wll the Vanderhofs lose their carefree way of life?

Frank Capra tried hard, but he was better at sentimentality than eccentricity. He just doesn't seem to know what a weird familoy looks like. Leave that to Wes Anderson. What makes this movie so enchanting is what Grandpa says in the jail cell: ""You can't take it with you, Mr. Kirby. So what good is it? As near as I can see, the only thing you can take with you is the love of your friends.""

That enchanting message rules the story, where the Vanderhofs devote time to art, food, fun and friendship. Capra introduces us to them through a timid clerk who decides ""I'm a lily!"" and follows Grandpa home. Before long, he's joined the pack and is happily making fireworks.

The film takes a darker turn in the last quarter, when the Vanderhofs appear to be leaving, Tony has lost Alice and soon quits his job, and Mr. Kirby begins to wonder if his moneyed, powerful life really is empty -- and if he really doesn't have any friends. But don't expect the free-spirited Vanderhofs to be squashed by a corporate president, no matter how powerful he is.

This was the first of Capra's collaborations with James Stewart, and Stewart is a bright spot in a stellar cast of solid, memorable actors. His Tony is unspoiled and sweet, and he longs to be part of a loving family. Barrymore does a stellar performance as the kindly Grandpa, who hides the poignant reason why he will never leave the house.

""You Can't Take It With You"" will leave you longing to become a lily of the valley, and remind you of what is truly important. The eccentricity doesn't fit as it could, but the bright, magical story makes up for that.",1152662400,5,2649,4.611464968152866

It's as if they are following techniques of ""Screwball Comedy Acting 101."" Edward Arnold, and James Stewart are always first rate. Aside from the excellent restaurant sequence with Stewart and Jean Arthur, the film is artificial.

Quick pace, great ensemble cast full of familiar faces and happy tears.  What more could you ask for?  Well, some closure on that Grandpa's IRS situation would be nice, but it never happens.

166210,5,0800114051,"I've come upon this film so many times on TV, it's nearly ridiculous. Unfortunately, each and every time, I've come in more than halfway through the picture, thus rendering it rather pointless to stop and watch. When I saw the DVD at the library this past weekend, though, I decided it was time to take the plunge and finally watch ""You Can't Take it With You"" for real. I'm glad I did.

If I sit back and think of Frank Capra pictures, I usually come up with the image of an ""American experience"" movie: well-intentioned, pleasing, grass-roots common-people patriotic, and sometimes a little overzealous. This film is no exception, but it's rather different from the Capra films most people remember - ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" of course, and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" - in that it's far more comedic. To the modern viewer, that might seem like a strike against it; even I'm a bit skittish with the ""controlled chaos"" aspect of 1930s comedy. However, the bulk of the film is so sweet, so idealistic, and so good-naturedly funny it's impossible to dislike. And underneath it all, there's a message that still applies today: money is the root of all evil. Or, as the characters would be more likely to put it, money's not the point of living.

It's a simple setup. There's a wacky family, all engaged in their own hobbies and small moneymaking endeavors, who live in a big house presided over by Grandpa Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore). Vanderhof is the only guy in town to resist takeover by the monopolizing banker Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold), but little does he know that his granddaughter (Jean Arthur) is seriously involved with Kirby's son (Jimmy Stewart). You can see where this is going, right? Simple American folk bungle their attempts to impress the rich future in-laws, while at the same time holding onto their values? Big businessman's cold heart is slowly but surely melted by honesty and happiness? Right, you've got it. No surprises here. It's all been done before, will all be done again, and in this case, it's a Pulitzer Prize-winning play - which are often moralistic to begin with - adapted and actually made more populist by that most moral of directors, Frank Capra. It feels like a play, sometimes to its detriment, and on occasion it feels like a moral tract. But it's a very entertaining one at that.

The joy of the film lies in the great characters. Everyone gets something to do, which is quite rare with a cast of some twenty individually-defined characters. Jimmy Stewart, of course, makes a great impression by sheer screen presence, even though he's one of the simpler, more obvious characters; at the same time, though, Harry Davenport (a very recognizable character actor), is just as memorable in a single scene. The standout performance is by Lionel Barrymore, and if you only know him as Mr Potter of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" you've got a surprise coming. He steals whole scenes with quiet speeches and folksy humor; an early one, with the bank clerk Mr Poppins, is just possibly the highlight of the whole film. If you ever catch the start of the film but can't sit through it all, make sure you experience that scene, at least. It's magical.

The film is not without flaws, of course. Capra greatly restructured the second half of the play to fit his own pet themes, and it does feel like a sudden shift in tone. It also makes the film about twenty minutes too long, with what seems like a false ending - and then, oh wait, there's more. And while the family's various hobbies and tricks are all very entertaining, they do wear out the third or fourth time we're trotted through them. But it's a fairly minor quibble...

I do heartily recommend the film, because even if it is a bit too long or a bit too moral, there's so much to enjoy it almost doesn't matter. It's nice to occasionally see a movie so irrepressibly idealistic and optimistic, and I challenge you not to finish watching the film without a big ol' happy grin on your face!",1127347200,2,3985,4.687142857142857

166212,5,0800114051,"If you were not in love with Jean Arthur before seeing this Frank Capra gem, you certainly will be afterward. Robert Riskin handed the great director another warm and hilarious screenplay, based this time on a play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. A perfect cast, which includes Jean Arthur, Lionel Barrymore, Jimmy Stewart, Spring Byington, Mischa Auer, Edward Arnold, Donald Meek, Ann Miller, Harry Davenport and Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, make this a true film classic.

The story centers around the impending marriage of Tony Kirby (Jimmy Stewart) and Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) and the complications that arise due to her very unconventional family, headed by her kind and loving grandfather, portrayed in memorable fashion by Lionel Barrymore. Everyone in her family does pretty much as they please, defying convention and unafraid to enjoy life to its fullest.

Alice's mother Penny (Spring Byington) writes plays because a typewriter was once delivered to their house by mistake. Her sister Essie (Ann Miller) can't dance worth beans but takes lessons anyway from a starving and slightly crazy Russian named Kolenkov (Mischa Auer). He knows she can't dance but comes for the food and might as well be one of the family. Alice's dad spends all his time creating fireworks and testing them out inside the house. And grandpa, who refuses to pay taxes, has brought home a Mr. Poppins (Donald Meek), whom he has talked into pursuing his true love, which happens to be the making of monstor masks. All the above is usually going on simultaneously as grandpa plays the harmonica.

Tony's family is involved in some strange thing called banking. His father Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold) is, in fact, one of the most powerful men in America, and seeking even more power in a deal that hinges on his acquisition of an entire city block. But Alice's family lives in that block and grandpa is quite happy to hold out so everyone in the neighborhood doesn't have to move.

There is a warm and charming scene as the young couple talk of their dreams and families on a bench by a moonlit lake. They end up dancing with some kids trying to make a buck, and Arthur somehow winds up with a sign on her back that reads: NUTS! Since Alice and Tony are on their way to meet his parents for the first time, it might just raise some eyebrows!

The sweet but nervous Alice finally arranges for the Kirbys to come for dinner. Tony brings them on the wrong night, however, and catches everyone being their normal and whacky selves. Even Alice gets caught in the act, sliding on the bannister! The only thing Anthony P. Kirby has in common with these folks is he once upon a time played the harmonica, just like Alice's grandpa. Both Lionel Barrymore and Edward Arnold shine, respectively, as man enjoying life, with lots of friends, and a man out to make more money, at any price.

A fireworks mishap lands both families in jail, and the press has a field day when they learn Anthony P. Kirby is in the clinck! Harry Davenport is wonderful as the wise judge they are brought before who does his best to straighten the mess out. The results are terrible, however, as Alice is hurt by Tony's family and runs away, refusing to let Tony know where she's at. She comes rushing back when word reaches her that her grandpa has given in to Kirby, and is selling their home.

It is Kirby who will set things right in the end as his love for his son and a foreshadowing of his own future causes gradpa's words to sink in. You really can't take it with you, but you sure can play the harmonica! Even Tony's stuffy mom might loosen up a bit, if handled in the right way. The daughter-in-law they didn't want, with the family they didn't like, may just prove to be the best thing that ever happened to the Kirbys.

Stewart and Arthur are great together, and Arthur is just magical in a couple of scenes. Eddie Anderson, Jack Benny's long-time sidekick, has a few fun moments also. No director ever straddled the line between the sweet and madcap better than Frank Capra, and this warm and wonderful film is proof of that.

""Well, George,"" Capra says, ""what do you think of my movie version of `You Can't Take It With You?'"" Kaufman slowly removes his glasses and looks at Capra like a side of creamed spinach he hadn't ordered. ""Mr. Capra,"" Kaufman says, ""not much."" Despite what Kaufman and his partner Moss Hart must have thought, however, I love the version of ""You Can't Take It With You"" that Capra and his regular screenwriter Robert Riskin concocted. Certainly Capra and Riskin take enormous liberties with the Kaufman & Hart original; they create new characters and jettison others (goodbye Grand Duchess Olga, hello Mr. Poppins); they introduce the income tax subplot with Grandpa Vanderhof, then abruptly drop it; and, above all, they add all the little-man glorification that was the Capra trademark, and absolutely antithetical to the airy lightness of the Kaufman esthetic. And yet I find I like Capra's conception at least as well as Kaufman's. For one thing, Capra was as masterful in staging gags as Kaufman was, and perhaps even better at telling a story; the Capra movie is totally engrossing throughout its two-hour-plus running time. For another, Capra knew how to direct actors, and to attract the very best actors to his projects. The Capra ""You Can't Take It With You"" has an incredibly brilliant cast, with all the actors working at the top of their game. Lionel Barrymore was superb at playing hateful old curmudgeons, as he proved in ""It's a Wonderful Life;"" he was even better at playing lovable old codgers, and his Grandpa Vanderhof is a marvel. You also have the outstanding romantic chemistry of the great James Stewart and the incomparable Jean Arthur, she of the Noble Roman beauty and endearingly froggy voice; the great Edward Arnold, playing his specialty--a smug fat cat--with conviction and aplomb; and a positive cornucopia of wonderful character actors including Mischa Auer, Spring Byington, the sprightly Ann Miller (was she REALLY only 15 when she made this movie?), the ineffable Dub Taylor (30 years before Bonnie & Clyde), and the aptly named Donald Meek. If Kaufman's version was the precursor of Neil Simon and the better sitcoms (Cheers, The Mary Tyler Moore Show), Capra is more like a prototype John Irving (though merely flirting with tragedy, rather than embracing it). Kaufman won the Pulitzer, Capra the Oscar, and all I can say is that they both deserved them. I have seen two TV versions of the original Kaufman-Hart play: one with Art Carney and Jean Stapleton, the other (a taping of a 1980s Broadway revival) with Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst.

166219,5,0800114051,"This is one of my very favorite Capra movies, somewhere along with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""It Happened One Night"", in fact it's a blending of those two films. This film is a real pleasure to watch from top to bottom. It portrays one of the best and most unmanufactured eccentric families ever to exist on screen. Lionel Barrymore steals the show as a grandfather abounding with grace, wisdom, and humor; the patriarch to a crazy clan who've discovered the secret to living a happy life: be yourself and be free, and material things don't matter so much as people do.

This film is full of that joy of life that Capra instills in his work. Like almost all his films it portrays a group of idealistic, independent, and good people in an intensely cynical and embittered world. And like almost all his films the idealists gets battered and bruised along the way, but eventually come out on top. Everything about this film is earnest and sincere, from the hopeful life affirming themes to the sweet romance between graceful and strong Alice (Jean Arthur) and free thinking, rebellious brahmin banker's son Tony (a very young and charming Jimmy Stewart).

The spirit and conflict of the film comes from the clash between Tony's stuck up and snobby aristocratic family and Alice's completly oblivious but adoring freewheeling lower class bohemian one. Tony's folks hate Alice, but Alice's folks love Tony. And Tony and Alice are crazy for each other, although Alice wants approval from his people, and he would love to run off and live in the woods with her tribe. This provides fertile soil for Capra's great ability to render comedy, a soaring social commentary, and also have time for some of those heartwarming, glowing dramatic moments. What you get on the other end is a natural, flowing, glowing, quirky ensemble romance flick with a higher message free of pretense, arrogance, and ""fakeness"", superbly crafted only the way a true master can.",1102204800,4,1948,4.864457831325301
166220,3,0800114051,"Winner of two Academy Awards in 1939 (Best Picture, Best Director - Frank Capra), based upon a Pulitzer Prize winning play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, boasting a stellar cast, I was more than a little disappointed that I found myself immune to YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU's charms. I really did much care for this movie.

  Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur play a pair of young lovebirds related to a pair of bickering elders.  Edward Arnold plays Stewart's father, a heartless industrialist who is building the largest monopoly in history if only he can buy a small lot owned by Arthur's eccentric grandfather Lionel Barrymore.

  Barrymore plays a man who dropped out of the business world thirty-odd years ago to stop and smell the roses.  Arnold's character is ruthless.

  The movie busies itself with the Stewart/Arthur romance, the education of Arnold's character, and takes every chance it can to allow Barrymore to dispense some homespun wisdom. For my money, Barrymore's brood is a little too eccentric, Edward Arnold is a little too cutthroat.

 My favorite scene also contained a bit that drove me to distraction.  An IRS comes to Barrymore's coveted house.  Barrymore hasn't paid his income tax for years.  The agent tries to convince Barrymore that he has to pay, while Barrymore parries with variations on ""What does that money buy me?""  In the meantime, granddaughter Ann Miller pirouettes poorly about the room, Spring Byington works on her play, Dub Taylor plays Mozart on the xylophones, and the boys in the basement are messing around with their home made fireworks.  Arnold and wife and son arrive.  They were supposed to meet Arthur's family tomorrow, so they're a day early.

  Edward Arnold was an excellent actor, and he played the stuffed shirt as good as anybody.  It's fun to watch his dignity assaulted time after time in this scene.  What isn't so much fun is listening to Barrymore drone on and on with his ostensibly homespun variations on ""Why should I pay taxes?""  It's supposed to be funny, I suppose, but in reality federal marshals would have run him in long before the frustrated IRS agent arrived.  Barrymore is allowed to rant, but the movie doesn't make him pay the consequences for his opposition.  In other words, the Barrymore character seemed phony to me, and that severely affected my entire reaction to this movie.

  This movie also shifts the point of view fairly frequently.  I think Capra was more effective when he narrow his sights to a single character.  It's a lot easier to get emotionally involved with a George Bailey or a John Doe when the great majority of events is filtered through them.

  So, with some disappointment, I gave this movie three stars.  The dvd picture is fine, but some of the words are recorded at such a low level they're impossible to hear.",1097971200,4,2826,4.814583333333333

The filmaker continues his favorite theme, downplaying the materalistic and embracing the things that really matter, love, both romantic & platonic, friends & family.  This type of material might be a preachy bore in the hands of a person less skilled than Frank Capra, but he makes it work.  Not only does it work, but the movie is hilarious.  The cast is excellent, starring Lionel Barrymore, I would say at his best, but I never saw anything he was in where he wasn't great.  Jimmy Stewart plays one of his nice guys here to the max & is terrific also.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well.  I especially loved the ""mad Russian""  played by Mischa Auer.  Eddie Anderson steals every scene he's in whether he's speaking or not.

166223,4,0800114051,"A fine Frank Capra comedy featuring Jimmy Stewart at his most boyish and gangly, and Jean Arthur as the girl of his dreams. It's a comedy of mismatched lovers: Stewart plays the son of a cold-hearted business tycoon (Edward Arnold) who looks forward to the coming world war as a way to make a killing on the stock market. In the path of Dad's capitalistic machinations lies a family of carefree bohemian kooks, whose open, life-affirming attitude holds together the neighborhood where Arnold hopes to build his next munitions factory. And guess what? Surprise...!! Jean Arthur's character also just happens to be the object of his son's affections. Into this ""Dharma & Greg""-like scenario, add Lionel Barrymore as her saintly, eccentric father, who was once a businessman but then dropped out and now spends his days smiling at life, following his passions, and encouraging others to do the same.
In all honesty, although the film is charming, it isn't Capra's best work -- adapted from a stage play by George Kauffman and Moss Hart, it shouts out its kookiness, and has the feel of an off-Broadway production gone awry. The scenes that are meant to show how wacky her family is often play out too broadly, with shouting and grand gestures and a flurry of chaotic action -- dancing, xylophone playing, cooking, painting, newspaper rustling, fireworks going off -- and all of it happening at once.  It's too obvious and dramatically weak... Plus, Stewart really hasn't found his feet yet as a star actor. On the other hand, both Barrymore and Arnold give delightfully strong performances, and Jean Arthur is *always* easy on the eyes.  Even when slightly muddled, Capra is still better than practically anything coming out comedywise from Hollywood today.  A charming 'Thirties comedy.",1068940800,7,1784,5.02027027027027

It's a wonderful, warm, witty, and simply enjoyable movie.  I love it.
The DVD:
1 star
I bought this DVD without reading any reviews (I also bought ""Talk of The Town"", a day-and-date Columbia release), because Columbia has, in the past, done astounding work restoring and remastering their old films (""It Happened One Night"" from their Classics collection is nothing short of an amazing transfer).  Apparently, their agenda has changed: they are now content to simply release anything as long as they can tout it as a ""high-definition remaster"", thus tricking their customers into thinking that some money and time was actually spent on striking a new print.  Both this and ""Talk Of The Town"" look and sound absolutely horrible.  The VHS version of this film has less grain and fewer sound defects (hissing, popping abound). In fact, this transfer is akin in quality to the one I often see on network television -- it's an absolute disaster on all levels.  Virtually unwatchable.  Avoid at all costs until Columbia treats its customers (and this film) right with a proper DVD release.  Even Paramount is doing it with their catalogue releases, Columbia!

I watched You Can't Take It With You on one of our family nights in our den. We popped the movie in, and figured on enjoying an evening of cinematic enjoyment comparable to It's A Wonderful Life. By the end of the movie, my opinion had changed.
Basically, besides the love story between Stewart's character, which is almost a side plot, the movie is about a pack of pirates who don't do anything...they just stay at home and lie around! Jimmy Stewart is pretty much the only thing that held this movie together for me, and the only reason that I finished the movie is that I hate to leave a movie started, but not finished.

On the flip side there is a fast paced money hungry business world that seems to produce great wealth and power, but little or no genuine happiness. And between them, the incomparable James Stewart. With his boyish good humor, he's able to recognize, long before his aristocratic parents, the value of the simple and joyous lifelstyle epitomized by his new found love and her family.

166229,3,0800114051,"I LIKE classic oldies, but this film stretches the bounds of believability, not to mention how horribly dated it feels.  I have no idea why it won a 1938 Best Picture Oscar, as it would never even be nominated nowadays. Of course, times were different then, but even so, it is simply not that good. It is filled with eye-rolling, oh-brother moments. For instance, Hollywood never used Anne Miller well, and here she is, attempting cringing ballet once again. She is out of place even in this screwball comedy. Here's another - a fancy restaurant scene is totally painful to watch, as it depends on a sign taped to Jean Arthur's back that everyone notices and laughs at, while our hero James Stewart, standing just behind her to a side, NEVER notices.  When he finally notices, does he remove it? No...they walk backwards to their table, knocking all sorts of things down.  Ha ha.  And he still doesn't remove it. He pretends later he is going to scream in the restaurant, so Jean Arthur screams in horror that he might scream and thereby causes the scene she wanted to avoid.  Ha ha.  Near the film's end, everything is solved because Anne Miller dances a ballet routine to...a xylophone and 2 harmonicas performed by the Grandpa character and the ""reformed"" villain of the story. This is just a ridiculous movie from start to finish.  The acting is okay but nothing extraordinary; however, folks who don't like the acting style of the 1930s probably should stay away.  At any rate, if you want to see a truly great James Stewart-Jean Arthur-Frank Capra film, skip this film and see ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" It is FAR superior and is more deserving of an Oscar than this film.
I'll give it 3 stars simply for the talent involved, but I think only folks interested in film nostalgia will HONESTLY enjoy this film.  There are much better screwball comedies to choose from, folks!  Try His Girl Friday!",1043625600,8,1906,4.696696696696697

166232,5,0800114051,"Recently, I found this movie at my aunt's home and decided to make a go of watching it even though it is black & white. The truth is, soon you absolutely forget that fact and become quite absorbed watching some of the most colorful free spirits you will ever see in an ""old"" movie.

Frank Capra once described a play he saw ""whose witchery was so entrancing, wild horses couldn't have dragged me away from the final curtain.""

This was of course ""You Can't Take it With You."" The Kaufman-Hart play. In fact, this movie is a bit like a play in some scenes.

The story centers around two families. One rich, one poor. The rich family is of course a threat to the entire community as they want to buy up the poor families homes so they can build a factory.

In the middle of this business deal, two people fall in love. Tony is the son of a rich businessman and Alice is the only working member of a rather eccentric family.

Alice (Jean Arthur) and Tony (Jimmy Stewart) have a warm chemistry that makes you just fall in love with them both and you want them to be together. Of course Tony's snooty mother is as cold as ice and his father is about to make the deal of his life, yet conflicted.

Alice's family is a mismatch of creative energy and is the basis for the humor in this story. When Tony takes his parents to Alice's home on the wrong night for dinner, the real fun begins. Just when you think the story can't get any worse for Tony's parents, it gets even more amusing. I laughed out loud plenty of times and it was so unexpected, but well worth the wait. The start of the movie is a little drab, but make yourself plow through the first bit.

In the first few scenes in Alice's home, there is a cat. Oh, look for that cat. It is adorable! It is sitting atop the pile of papers next to the typewriter and just as it is getting comfortable, Alice's mother picks up the cat and uses it as a paperweight of sorts to hold down the pile of papers. Anyway, it is quite cute.

During the production, Lionel Barrymore was suffering from arthritis, and needed crutches to move around. They worked this nicely into the movie by claiming the character sprained his ankle sliding down the banister. Lionel will have you rolling on the floor yourself as he deals with a very frustrated IRS man and bring you close to tears as he plays the harmonica with his newest friend.

A movie everyone should see because it deals with such very human ideas, and well...it is also just hilarious!

A timeless classic!

Corny! Lord, is 'You Can't Take It With You' corny.
And dated.
I won't argue that many of this Capra classic's
sensibilities haven't slipped from vogue.  But kids,
this is an old movie starring a lot of famous old
actors that you might want to check out.  It's about
a family of eccentrics living together in a single
house and behaving like a truckload of Looney Tunes
characters let out on loan from the Warner Brothers
studios.  They don't fret money. They don't fret
mores. They don't fret the authorities. They don't
give a hoot about appearances.  In fact, they don't
do much of anything, other than what they feel like
doing, which is usually nothing that'll help anyone,
not even themselves.
I'm willing to admit that even as a fable it's not a
very practical, pragmatic, or mature message to impart
on a child.  But impart it on yours anyway.  Just about
everything else kids meet in this world will teach them
to be pragmatic, sensible, even calculating, quick
enough.
I think every ten-year old kid should see this movie
(and 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington', and 'Meet John
Doe').  Parents, wrestle those young'uns away from
blowing things up on their video console, or from
watching things get blown up on television, and force
them to watch this flick.  If they're too jaded by age
ten, then show it to 'em when they're nine, or eight.
Heck, beam it at 'em 'in utero'.
The collective message of Frank Capra's films is
frequently misidentified by his critics as a belief that
human beings are all inherently good, and will do good
if given the chance.  Such critics like to point out how
dangerously naive that belief is (and they're right),
but Capra's message is more subtle than that: that any
community--a town, a country, or a family--can and
should be based around an unwavering doctrine of
unconditional compassion.  Once you have that, you're
protected from this oh-so pragmatic, sensible, and
calculating world.
SIDE NOTE: Jean Arthur was the greatest celluloid
combination of knockout sex appeal, smarts, and comic
ability ever, and young girls looking for better role
models than the narcissistic twits personified on film
these days by the likes of Cameron Diaz and Julie Roberts
should check her out in this and other Capra classics.",1020297600,5,2269,4.809768637532134

And, ""Isn't there anything else he'd rather be doing?"". When the milquetoast clerk pulls out a delightful invention of his, Barrymore asks him why he is punching numbers into a machine instead of inventing things. He then invites him to join his oddball household where ""everybody does what they want to do"" and be a ""lily of the field."" They survive on a meager income, because what they ""do"" makes them happy, not what they can ""get.""
Barrymore's family has found the secret to success. Live life to the fullest now, because after all, when it's over, you can't take it with you. John Barrymore and his ""family"" are incredibly fun to watch, and will make you want to throw out your TV, quit your job, and dance (to the harmonica) in their living room.

Jimmy is the son of a powerful banker, bent on buying up a block of homes in order to a build a factory which will increase his wealth. Jean is his secretary, and as it turns out, lives in the only house on the block that is holding out on the deal. Lionel Barrymore plays her grandfather; a simple man who gave up working years earlier because he did not enjoy it, and completely opposed to selling the house - for the memories he has for it still linger; and that of his dead wife compel him to hold on to it. Values like these are amply expressed in the movie. Among the eccentric people living in this house are Spring Byington, who plays Jean's mother. She writes play after play, after play. Dub Talyor is xylophone player who likes to write things. Ann Miller is his wife. She enjoys tap. Donald Meek joins the family, and his favorite hobby is ""making things up""; little monster masks, and wind up musical boxes that pop up.
And when all these zany people come together in this eccentric home, the fun and mahem really begins.
""You can't Take it With You"" is a true delight to come out of the golden age of movies.

Barrymore is being pressured to sell his house to a big businessman, Edward Arnold, who is trying to buy all the surrounding property to build a factory.  Barrymore resists, but the problem is that his granddaughter Jean Arthur has fallen in love with Jimmy Stewart, the son of Arnold.  It all becomes the story of big business vs. the little guy, the rich vs. the ordinary man.  In other words, the typical conflicts of many of director Frank Capra's films.  The film starts off a little slowly, but picks up energy and steam as it goes along.  There are a number of terrific scenes, including Stewart and Arthur in the restaurant, the fireworks explosion, and the courtroom.  Stewart and Arthur give fine performances, but the film really belongs to Barrymore and Arnold, playing men with opposite viewpoints who basically want the same thing out of life.
