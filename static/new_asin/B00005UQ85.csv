1668587,3,B00005UQ85,"The DVD arrived on time. I started out looking at the DVD but I got a little board with the first part of it.
I'll try watching it again and give it another chance.",1272326400,,164,3.8529411764705883
1668588,1,B00005UQ85,Pompous overblown presentation with very little of value.  Only minor projects being described as major activities.  Save your money and time.,1255737600,4,142,5.714285714285714
1668589,4,B00005UQ85,I ordered this DVD and a few others to plan my trip to the Grand Canyon. This DVD arrived from Finley-Holiday quickly and well packaged. Other DVD's I ordered from other companies were lost by the postal service and after 2 weeks had to be overnighted by Amazon Customer Service. The Images On this DVD are awesome and most of the background music is well fitted. This DVD was cheaper and better than the other DVD's I ordered. Its a nice way to spend 20 minutes.,1255478400,,463,4.395348837209302
1668590,4,B00005UQ85,"This video consists of geology and history of what is known about the Grand Canyon. If you are looking for a ""vacation"" video of what to see and do during a visit, you should probably choose a different title. Very well put together with excellent video and narration. It didn't go in to depth on many topics, but raised a lot of questions about the current state of many issues at the Grand Canyon.",1237593600,13,399,4.405405405405405
1668591,5,B00005UQ85,"This is exactly what I was looking for - a full 50 minutes of video cam of Grand Canyon, without any ""cheap information""(history, interview, anything that's not great views of Grand Canyon). Video taken at wonderful angles to present you the best of Grand Canyon that you can hardly capture by your own cam. Love it.",1235520000,3,316,4.660714285714286
1668592,5,B00005UQ85,"This 1986 video features a spectacular helicopter ride, with no obtrusive narration. Instead, some great classical music accompanies this visual treat, which is akin to those relaxation tapes that soothe the senses. The color is slightly faded, but those familiar with the GC know that colors are always changing there, so it's not a real distraction. The Grand Canyon has been around for millions of years; a 20 year old video shouldn't make much difference. They also filmed this before the helicopters were given their restrictions. Any view of the GC is a treat, and this 1 hour video is stunning.",1147305600,2,601,4.96039603960396
1668593,5,B00005UQ85,"I used this dvd at work in the customer area with surround sound, and have had nothing but compliments. This dvd and the others by image products about our national parks are nothing but the best. Without narration and with music, makes it the tops.",1103500800,8,249,4.555555555555555
1668594,2,B00005UQ85,"I live in the UK and ordered this movie as a prelude to visiting the grand canyon in person for the second time (since I went some years ago).
I have a home cinema system with a 100"" projection screen. I therefore believed this DVD would look impressive. However I was a little disappointed by the picture quality but a lot more by the soundtrack which was poor quality.
Although the scenery is impressive on the film, there is no soundtrack apart from music. This is it's main failing, since I was hard pressed to sit through 55 minutes of scenery, mixed in with closeups of flowers, wildlife and a steam train with no narative.  This could have been hugely informative, with good shots of scenery but it needed a narrator to give history, background, facts and figures, geology etc etc. As it was, I turned it off after 40 minutes because the scenery, beautiful though it was, all started to look rather similar. THe program desperately needed some facts and figures to break it up.
Overall I was disappointed and probably would not watch this DVD again. In any case it doesn't compare with the IMAX productions that are far superior, or to being there in person.",1055462400,14,1165,4.600961538461538
1668595,5,B00005UQ85,"My wife & I have have experienced the Grand Canyon's beauty by mule and twice on overnight hiking trips and are about to embark on a 6-day white water rafting trip through the Grand Canyon. This DVD is by far the best depiction of the Canyon's beauty that I've ever seen. However, you have to experience the Grand Canyon yourself to put all this beauty seen on the DVD in perspective.",1013904000,22,384,4.422535211267606
7955433,5,B00005UQ85,"I just viewed this DVD and it is most worthwhile! Very informative and educational-one learns about the history of Grand Canyon, peoples from long ago, plants, and animal life. And what is being done to help and prolong the animal and bird life there. I highly recommend this!",1503360000,,276,4.770833333333333

7955435,2,B00005UQ85,"We were hoping for more panorama scenery, sort of a glimpse VBeras of what we will experience when going this spring. Instead it seemed to focus on vegetation.i am sure there are other options out there for our needs. Suggestions?",1486080000,,230,4.775

7955439,5,B00005UQ85,"The one DVD I checked was Grand Canyon, America's Wild Spaces.  It features a rare scientific expedition to explore the canyon's 277 mile long voyage.  It covers different plants, animals fish and eagles.  The canyon was not made in a day but it can be changed for the worse due to climate change which would impact everything!  Hunters used bullet with lead will poison bald eagle.  Tourists are recorded on different lookout points to throw coins for their wishes.  A coin killed a bald eagle.  This DVD is a field trip to one of the wonders of the world down at the river level.  The Colorado River changed course a million years ago still puzzled scientists as to why it happened.
This DVD enables viewers to appreciate this American wonder and motivates all of us to preserve this sacred place for our future generations.  It will be a good collection to have if you had been there.",1428883200,,887,4.598726114649682
7955440,5,B00005UQ85,"What a beautiful place, our country has such a diverse array of land. It just takes your breath away. The two DVD.s show my family and friends just how beautiful it is ! Very pleased.",1420502400,,183,4.257142857142857
7955441,5,B00005UQ85,Very satisfied with this purchase.,1417305600,,34,6.0
7955442,4,B00005UQ85,"Based on what I read on the back of the DVD cover, I was expecting to see parts of the canyon that the average visitor does not get to see in person. That being said, this is not a video meant to entice you to come visit the Grand Canyon for yourself, although it may achieve that objective anyway. The documentary, which is about 45 minutes long, is intended to educate the audience about environmental issues around this great natural beauty. It also discusses some Native American history of the area. It is appropriate for families as well as a middle school or high school audience.

My favorite scenes are the ones in which the scientists are riding the rapids, because the blue waters of the Colorado and the brownish red canyon rocks look so beautiful taken altogether. I was a little disappointed they did not show the North Rim as much, and I got a little bored somewhere in mid-video, but oh well. I learned that the California condors choke and die from silver coins thrown by silly tourists, and that ticks that ride on squirrels and other animals often carry the same disease that led to the Bubonic Plague.",1399852800,,1121,4.577114427860696
