387428,5,6301964314,"I saw this film over 25 years ago. It made a permanent imprint on  me. I had never seen anything like it (and haven't, since). It's a western, and a fantasy (but not science fiction). It's also mythological and even a bit religious. It's also a wonderful, life-affirming film. I've never been a fan of Tony Randall, who I always remember as the prissy little neurotic in ""The Odd Couple,"" but I have to give him the greatest credit in this movie (he plays six parts!) The special effects are Ray Harryhausen stop-motion (and obviously fake) but that is part of the enormous charm of this movie--as exemplified by the amusing-looking snake in the cage with a man's face on it, and the goldfish-bowl-dwelling monster than attempts to snack on Dr. Lao. In some ways this movie reminds me of Ray Bradbury's _Something Wicked This Way Comes,_ but this is a far superior film. In fact, I'd have to call it a classic.",981244800,91,910,4.58282208588957
387429,5,6301964314,"""7 Faces of Dr. Lao"" has been my all-time favorite film for 20 years. It is the best movie from fantasy/science-fiction film pioneer George Pal (his other wonderful films include ""The Time Machine,"" ""Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm,"" and ""War of the Worlds""). The script was written by fantasy-master Charles Beaumont (""Twilight Zone,"" ""Masque of the Red Death"") adapted from the cult novel ""Circus of Dr. Lao"" by Charles Finney. The special effects, while unpolished by today's standards, are done by masters of their art, including the best stop-motion animator ever, Jim Danforth. It is well acted by a great cast: Barbara Eden, Arthur O'Connel,and (most of all)Tony Randall in the role(s) of his career.
This is a magical, moving, marvelous one-of-a-kind film, and now that it's on DVD, DON'T MISS IT! You'll want to enter the world of Dr. Lao over and over.",976060800,15,868,4.993103448275862
387430,4,6301964314,"The comment in the title above is not meant to be detrimental to this fine, if offbeat, movie.  ""The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao,"" with excellent stop-motion animation from Harryhausen, is an unusual blend of Eastern mysticism (Hollywood-style), Old West myth, psuedo-Freudian psychology, Old World fantasy, and 60's film storytelling.  With a great Tony Randall performance, the sight of a pre-Jeannie Barbara Eden, and a most unique transformation from fish to reptile, the movie is a lot of fun.  Not just for kiddies, ""Lao"" may not be a classic, but it is one that still holds up after all these years.",969667200,3,601,4.930693069306931
387431,5,6301964314,"While cosmetically, the ""Seven Faces"" (as our fan club affectionately calls it)  is not polished, the film's appearance does not reflect upon the deeper issues revolving around Tony's performance.  When  one considers Tony's roles, consider his first words - ""Excuse  please""  This is nothing other than brilliant.  Tony is simply  apologizing for presence as a big star in a small town performance.  He is  the big goldfish in a small bowl.  Even his name is small - it is  ""low"" -not l-OW! as others call him.
Some people don't  understand Seven Faces. They think it stinks. They think the acting is  horrific and the sets are from a local middle school.  They also don't  understand the plot (especially the part about the family and the snowman).  The humor does fade at times.
!Excuse!  They are wrong.  Tony is superb.  The film shows off his assets very well.  He can be Pan, he can be a snake,  he can be a woman, he can be Merlin.  This is important.
Why was this  movie made?  We don't know, but we are glad that it was.  The dragon is  bigger than all of us. Tony is better than all of us.  Dr. Lao is older  than all of us. Understand?  Neither do I!  Tony explains, then  dances.
In fact, Dr. Lao is a seven ring circus that makes viewers dance.  Not only does Dr. Lao save the town he also saves our soul.  He captures  our imaginations and prevents us from falling into the pitfalls of modern  materialism for we ARE the townspeople and we must not sell our lives  inorder to promote business!
Tony takes on many roles, as many as it  takes to show us our souls and urge us to look deeper than we've looked  before.  What man is not changed after seeing the despised snowman or the  pitiful Merlin who can no longer produce the same magnitude of magic.  Merlin is despondent because of youth's reluctance to believe, the plight  of the downtrodden Indian, and the villains belief that man is a miserable  evil creature.  But Dr. Lao is bigger than all this.  Simply put it is a  showcase for Tony's talent.  This movie glorifies Tony's ability.  The  greatest actor in the modern arena.
Seven Faces defies categorization.  In a video store, where do you find it?  Academy Awards section? (It won  one!) Horror?  Drama? Mystery?  Cult classics?  Adult? NO: FANTASY.  It is  beyond the average film in all ways.  it is fantastic.  it is lao.
Don't  forget the time of Communist rule - the discussion of ""dictators""  and capitalists at the beginning of the film and the fact that Lao is from  China.  ""Seven Phases of Chairman Mao?""
""Who You? Who  You?"" I am Randall - greatest of all magicians.  No sight is sadder  than Tony alone amongst the crowd during the circus performances. he has no  peers.  he has no friends.  he is alone with himself and shall always know  only his own magic.

A completely uncommon western.  Food  for the soul. Lessons for life at all ages.  Tony Randall capturing your  imagination in a role...roles! as he never did before or since.

387500,5,6301964314,"A dysfunctional town is soon to be a railway way station. Only Clint Stark (Arthur O'Connell) knows this and is making the towns people even more dissatisfied with their life so he can buy them out cheaply.

Can no one come to the rescue not only for the economics but the people them selves?

A mysterious little visitor appears and everyone is excited to see he has brought a circus.

As each person visits the circus they are confronted with his/her self. Whether he/she recognizes it or not is a different matter.

The finally performance tells a tale of a city lost in history and the people again look familiar.

The movie has appeal on many levels. Such as Tony Randall plays many parts as Dr. Lao, Merlin, Pan, The Abominable Snowman, Medusa, a Giant Serpent, Apollonius of Tyanna, and an audience member.

There is a parade of talented actors. Barbra Eden gets to sweat. Special effects are by George Pal (War of the Worlds, and The Time Machine"". And the movie is based on the book ""The Circus of Dr. Lao"" by Charles G. Finney.

""The whole world is a circus if you look at it the right way. Every time you pick up a handful of dust and see not the dust but a mystery, a marvel there in your hand. Every time you stop and think I'm alive and being alive is fantastic. Every time such a thing happens, you are part of the circus of Dr. Lao.""",1503792000,,1349,4.350597609561753

387704,5,6301964314,"This is one of my top-10 favorite films.  One of the props in it (seen just in passing) is also featured in another favorite (The Wizard of Oz).  Said prop is the extra-large hour glass owned by the Wicked Witch in Oz, which contains red sand,  surrounded by small carved gargoyle-like creatures.  Director George Pal, whose stop-action fantasy films were in themselves groundbreaking, may have just found the hourglass lying around on the old MGM lot (where this film was made), or may have included it on purpose, so see if fans (like us) would notice.

William Tuttle's wonderful make-up skills (for which he won a special-recognition Oscar) transform Tony Randall into each of seven characters (he also makes a cameo, near the end, sitting in the audience as himself).  It's hard to classify this film, but ""fantasy,"" like most of Pal's other most-celebrated works, probably suits it best.  It takes place in the fictional turn-of-the-century small Western town of Abalone (which, not by accident, sounds a bit like Babylon when pronounced), and is a morality tale pitting the power of one-man's greed against the avarice of the ordinary townsfolk.

The magical Dr. Lao and his very unusual circus (featuring a variety of characters from popular Greek and Roman mythology) come to town and cause all-concerned to reflect on who they are, and what they're doing.  I first saw this roughly 50 years ago, and have owned it on DVD.  I was delighted to find it available on Amazon Prime Instant Video, as well, as a downloadable purchase.  It's well-worth the asking price.

Also featured in the film are a young Barbara Eden (of ""I Dream of Jeanie"" fame), Arthur O'Connell, Noah Beery, Jr., and many other popular character actors of the day.  If you enjoy fantasy films, Tony Randall, the works of George Pal, or movies that nearly defy categorizing, this may become one of your favorites, too.

387839,5,6301964314,"An old classic comedy, without nudity, potty mouth or gratuitous violence.  Fortunately, it made its money in the sixties, because nowadays, almost no one would pay to see such an unconventional and encouraging film.  Heavy on the magic and mythology, but also explains what is really important in life for younger viewers.  Hopefully, it will never be turned in to a video game!

If you like Tony Randall and miss Barbara Eden, you'll probably like this movie.

387885,5,6301964314,"The whole world is a circus if you know how to look at it. The way the sun goes down when you're tired and comes up when you want to be on the move. That's real magic. The way a leaf grows, the song of the birds. The way the desert looks at night with the moon embracing it. Oh, my boy, that's a circus enough for anyone. Every time you watch a rainbow and feel wonder in your heart. Every time you pick up a handful of dust and see not the dust, but a mystery, a marvel, there in your hand. Every time you stop and think 'I'm alive and being alive is fantastic!' Every time such a thing happens, you're part of the Circus of Dr. Lao.""  Dr. Lao

The time is the dawn of the 20th century. The mystical traveling circus of Dr. Lao (Tony Randall) arrives at the dusty small town of Abalone, Arizona bearing marvels and legendary characters. Everyone turns out for the strange and fascinating event to see Dr. Lao and his amazing performers:

1. Merlin, the great magician of Arthurian legend
2. Pan, the god of shepherds and forests in Greek mythology
3. Apollonius of Tyana, a blind soothsayer and philosopher
4. Medusa, a fabled creature of Greek legend
5. The Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas still said to exist today
6. A hissing serpent that bears a rather uncanny resemblance to Abalones scheming businessman, Clinton Stark

Then there is Dr. Lao himself, a mysterious stranger who rode into Abalone from out of nowhere to teach important life lessons to townspeople who have lost touch with the joys of life. Meanwhile, the greedy Clint Stark (Arthur O'Connell) works to convince the people that their land is worthless so he can buy it all up to make way for a railroad. Fans of classic movie magic, as well as the young at heart, are sure to enjoy this delightful western fable. Rated G.",1456704000,4,1797,4.4363636363636365

7 FACES OF DR. LAO: Diminutive Dr. Lao (Randall) rides into the Old West town of Abalone, circa 1912, puffing his opium pipe, ready to set up his traveling circus. He stumbles into a town crisis, however: Greedy land baron Stark (OConnell) is trying to buy up the town, while idealistic newspaper editor Ed Cunningham (Ericson) crusades for people to stay and create a community.

The entire town attends Laos show, and everyone sees something specialbut few are capable of understanding exactly what they see. Laos center ring spectacle illustrates the fall of a great city into oblivion, cryptically revealing the fate of their own town should they sell out to Stark. Will surreal estate agent Laos parable open the eyes of the citizens, allowing them to save their fledgling community?

Discussion: Are you an acrobat? eight-year-old Mike asks Dr. Lao. Only philosophically, the ancient Asian replies, a twinkle in his eye. His circus is more than just surface; its a mythic mirror, specializing in wisdom. The sideshow is stocked with mythic figures: Pan; a Medusa; the Lock Ness monster; Apollonius of Tyana, cursed to tell the truth, however ugly; Merlin, the wizened wizard, slowly succumbing to senilityand every one of these characters is played by Randall.

Each visitor gravitates to the figure most likely to mirror his or her own myth, and peering into that reflection of destiny provides each with a cosmic context for their petty problems. There are more things in heaven and earth than the residents of a dusty Western town can ever dream of, but the pixieish impresario provides them with the opportunity to understand that even Abalone can become an Avalonand that the entire world is a circus, full of magic and miracles, if you just adjust your perspective.

Not only is this a literally fabulous film, full of fun, poignance and timeless wisdom (not to mention exceptional stop-motion effects courtesy of Ray Harryhausen), but its also the role(s) of Randalls careera tour de force in which he plays literally half the characters in the film. And by all means read Charles Finneys brilliant, hilarious, astonishingly original source novel! Too few have!",1423180800,,2429,4.943627450980392

Tony Randall is the star actor, and his showmanship was second to none as he played several roles.  Tony Randall, in the role of Dr. Lao portrays combinations of behavior of comedy, wisdom, common sense and fantasy in 7 multiple faces.  Each character has a hidden meaning of value for life which any viewer of any age can understand.  The circus is quite a tent to enter performed by a Chinese impresario, Dr. Lao.  The production of each fantasy was
ahead of its time.  The worthiness of this movie was acknowledged by the Academy that awarded this production with an honorary Oscar.  Whether an individual or a family, here is a movie worthy of family entertainment with inherent lessons about the real values

388357,5,6301964314,"All of Tony Randall's comedies are, well, a bit strange or quirky. Here he plays a little Chinese impresario of a traveling circus, Dr. Lao, who mysteriously makes his presence known in a small western town. His circus and its many characters (all played by Randall) are nothing but mirrors to the townsfolk, their hopes, fears and foibles. Dr. Lao and his circus arrives in the nick of time to save the town from an unscrupulous land baron.

If you are a fan of Tony Randall, or just like your comedy quirky, I highly recommend the 7 Faces of Dr. Lao.

It is quaint and readily re-watchable. Special effects by George Pal who was preeminent at the time.

Another fine Tony Randall comedy is The Brass Bottle. Buryl Ives portrays a well-meaning genie who only manages to bring trouble rather than joy to the Randall character's life. It is terribly funny and, well, quirky too.

They are my two favorite Randall comedies.",1403654400,,921,4.666666666666667

I still get a little choked up over those two scenes (so many special moments in this film)--during Merlin's stage performance, when he asks the skeptical, rude audience to 'believe in him' and the little boy, asking Dr. Lao to let him join the circus---wow, powerful stuff!

It is not a phenominal piece of movie making and does drag at times but there are many good parts if you like this sort of thing.---- Tony Randal (white) playing the role of a Chinese  magic circus owner putting on the circus in a super small western town.---  Dr. Lao (Tony R.) teaches the townspeople many moral lessons through his special wizard talents (early special effects) and his humurous demeanor and attitude towards life.----- Its a good little B Movie But let me be clear ---Its a B movie.

Simple enough for children to enjoy and learn from, but clever enough in dialogue for adults to enjoy if they take the time to listen.  The morals expressed throughout the movie are ones everyone should live by, the world would be a better place if they did.
Tony Randal is brilliant in this movie, for which I fail to understand why he was not nominated for an Academy Award.  It was nominated for an Academy Award for Special Effects, but lost to ""Mary Poppins"".
I watched this movie as a child in the theater when it was first released in 1964 and was mesmerized by the characters and special effects, but I also took away the great morals of the story that would make this world a lot better place to live if everyone took them to heart.  When watching this movie as an adult, I still enjoyed it as I was able to pick up on all of the clever and creative dialog that I didn't get as a child.

Big props to Amazon's customer service, though. I called to complain and a replacement was sent right away. Unfortunately, the replacement DVD had the same problem (though not as potent). I called and, since they couldn't guarantee the same issue wouldn't happen a third time, I asked for and got a full refund and a promise they'd look into the issue.

I first saw this sweet movie about 10 years after it was released.  I was in Santa Barbara and went to one of those crazy movie-fests where they packed the house with students, hippies and whatever to see six films.  The best movie (I think it was ""The Sterile Cuckoo"" was save to almost last, and 7 Faces was the opening filler.

At first the crowd paid little attention to it, but as it wove it's spell over them, the place became unusually attentive. They were fascinated by it, as was I.  Tony Randall was simply amazing. A good, happy film with a good corny sweet ending.

Decided to purchase it so I wouldn't be left to the mercy of TV and when they'd play it again and when and where is just about impossible to find.

388729,5,6301964314,"This is a worthy effort from 1964 to create a fantasy adventure for the entire family. The story involves a mystical Chinese gentleman named Dr. Lao who brings a circus to town and changes the small town for the better. At first it seems as if his magic and mysteries are nothing more than figments of an overactive imagination and cheap parlor tricks but then one begins to discover there is much more there than meets the eye.

The movie is set in a small western town that is about to undergo major changes known only to a scheming businessman. The entry of Dr. Lao and his circus into town and the efforts of two young men who own the newspaper complicate the businessman's plans so he decides to take action against them.

It is fun to watch the magic of Dr. Lao and the determination of the two young men begin to have its effect on the town's future. Those things that seemed at first to be fakery suddenly turn into the real thing. The special effects, though dated by today's standards, are adequately convincing and help carry the story along.

The movie has moments of humor, mystery, and excitement that help make it a very nice evening's entertainment. I recommend it for the entire family.",1341619200,5,1203,4.534562211981567

388731,4,6301964314,George Pal is best known for some of his earlier films (Destination Moon; When Worlds Collide; The War of the Worlds; The Time Machine) and this fantasy set in the American west in the early 1900's is a different type of movie - but with the above it is a classic film. The plot is mentioned in a number of reviews; the movie is superbly directed and the cast overall does a good job. Wonderful make-up transforming Randall into so many characters. Highly recommended as a family movie and for all fans of Pal's work.,1339804800,3,517,4.4526315789473685

I got the chance to see it again as an adult but fell asleep and still missed the ending. So imagine my surprise when I found I could order Dr. Lao from Amazon. Now I not only got to view the entire movie and still enjoyed the special effects as I did as a kid, but I also could appreciate the acting of Tony Randall and the sweet story to boot with nary a curse word to be heard!",1334275200,3,514,3.858490566037736

388801,5,6301964314,"I have seen and loved this movie since it was first release and yes compared to the cakes made out of solid frosting made today.  (Fancy computer special effects)  This movie has some rare qualities and that is a great talent of Tony Randall.  One of the best second bananas...his timing is well just brilliant.  Yes it is in some ways corny and lower tech special effects but the far out premise is great!  I have had folks see it especially when the city of Vallejo had a smoodzing snake of a developer sweet talk the town.

I just love the scene with the bullies, priceless! The movie is Jesus saying in Mathew:  ""Beware of false prophets, for they come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.  You will know them by their deeds...""  This movie is still just as relevant then as today, especially the current political scene.  Glad to see the excellent DVD issue.",1323907200,3,892,4.51875

Right now the price is SO high. but then I told him he had to bang the tape cartridge onto a countertop, and flip it over and do the same on the other side.  That this would LOOSEN the tightness of the tape.  IT WORKED!!!He enjoyed watching the movie that day.",1316044800,,500,4.15625

It's for the entire family and the only thing you could want is...A DR. LAO TOO!",1287532800,2,358,4.741935483870968

Tony Randall does an excellent performance portraying different aspects of the human condition that ether makes or breaks human happiness and giving it back to the subject at hand. Of coarse Barbra Eden didn't hurt the movie at all. The ending will leave in wonder.",1255478400,3,411,4.6438356164383565

But Dr. Lao's circus is no ordinary circus.  From the moment it appears, seemingly out of nowhere, the residents of a quiet, turn of the century western town soon find out that this circus will change their lives forever.
The various acts in Dr. Lao's circus (all performed by Randall in many guises) will force the townsfolk to forget their own petty and self absorbing problems and take an insightful look inward.
Good special effects for the era and some very good performances by a note worthy cast.
A very enjoyable trip into the past!!!",1214179200,,709,4.664

The original STAR WARS films look dated to me, but this seems strangely relevant.
I remember being dragged out of this film as a child because I was crying at the end.
Seeing it again, if you AREN'T crying at the end you should be institutionalized!
This was a movie for great character actors with a fine story. In fact it is a story potentially damaging to the current Administation.

7817953,3,6301964314,I used to watch the t.v. series of the odd couple when I was a kid.  And that is how I always remember Tony Randall.  I was pretty young the first time I saw this movie.  I don't think it was at the theater.  It might have been on t.v.  And it seems like it might have even been at a drive inn.  Any way Tony Randall does very well in this.  He has a traveling circus and plays I think seven different characters.  Each of which gives the citizens of the town a good moral lesson.  I loved this movie when I was a good.  And it surprisingly holds up very well as an adult.  I think Tony Randall did such amazing work in this he should have at gotten a best actor nomination.,1518825600,,674,3.9185185185185185
