2667530,2,B000JBXHLE,"This item is supposedly titled ""UFOs: The First Encounters."" It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation.",1159488000,4,207,5.5
2667531,1,B000JBXHLE,The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them.,1157673600,3,422,4.410256410256411

8149455,5,B000JBXHLE,I was really digging into American and South American history and these videos helped me do that. Well worth the time and money!,1418860800,,128,4.608695652173913
8149456,1,B000JBXHLE,"You can watch it on you tube for free. You can down load it or stream.
  There are lots of movies you can watch for free on you tube.
 There are many movies you can't watch free on you tube. For those, I DO recommend purchasing them from Amazon.

 I will be purchasing all 4 seasons of Game of Thrones. You can watch it on you tube for free.
I DO recommend purchasing them from Amazon.",1397606400,,385,4.0131578947368425
8149457,5,B000JBXHLE,"Has this series been removed?  I am very interested to watch ""The Lost Castles of England"" and the episode about North American burial mounds, both of which said ""download only"", but when I clicked them it changed to ""Not Available""",1363132800,,232,4.8
8149458,2,B000JBXHLE,Okay so the DVD by A&E called secrets of the Aztecs is EXACTLY the same as the DVD by History Channel called The Aztec Empire.  The only difference is that Leonard Nimoy is the narrator of one and not the other.  Total waste of money.  All it talks about is how the Aztecs liked to sacrifice people and babies!  No real HISTORY of the Aztecs or anything like that.  Save your money!,1256083200,12,382,4.25
8149459,5,B000JBXHLE,Run time was 48 minutes.  A stellar documentary.  The download worked perfectly.  Hope the review was helpful.  ty.,1169251200,,115,5.222222222222222
8149460,1,B000JBXHLE,"I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of ""The Black Death"", but I still wanted to see the full show!",1164844800,3,246,4.212765957446808
8149461,5,B000JBXHLE,This is an excellent documentary of Shangri-La and its elusive transcendental nature.,1161475200,,85,6.166666666666667
