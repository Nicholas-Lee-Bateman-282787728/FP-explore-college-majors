2936371,2,B000VD5IAI,My toddler just didn't believe this Old version to be the Pingu she knows and loves.  She wasn't interested.,1244332800,,108,4.684210526315789
2936372,4,B000VD5IAI,"We purchased this as our daughter (1.5 years) adores Pingu and his antics (albiet the morals are a little questionable at times). I agree with other reviewers, this version is a little more ""Hollywood"" compared to the earlier work and perhaps the episodes are not as good. However, it makes our daughter laugh and at this point as long as it's Pingu - she doesn't see a huge difference. Worth a look if your children are into Claymation.",1243036800,,437,4.615384615384615
2936373,2,B000VD5IAI,"I bought 3 videos for my kids 2 to 4, years old. Butu unfortunately this is not the original pingu. They supposely have improved the the filming and animation but actually they have complpetely lost the spirit and charm of the original pingu's.",1240358400,4,244,4.6976744186046515
2936374,5,B000VD5IAI,"I love Pingu.  He is so cute and reminds me of me (being the older sibling).  This is just another DVD I need to have of Pingu - I want them all!  More Pingu, please!",1229385600,,166,3.6857142857142855
2936375,5,B000VD5IAI,"the Pingu DVD's are funny in way that's entertaining to kids and adults. they incorporate a lot of typical kiddy themes (sibling rivalry, not liking veggies at dinner time, etc) in a really funny un-sappy way. my 22 month old LOVES them and frankly, so do i!",1213574400,,258,4.51063829787234
2936376,5,B000VD5IAI,"Pingu is the silliest non english speaking penguin ever. His ordeals are real and relatable to toddlers. my three old laughs hysterically everytime he watches it. It's not just pure mindless entertainment, if you watch it with your child you will see it instills very good life lessons and family values along with it's funny nature. Although they speak some jibberish language the context is clear and fun for kids.",1203811200,,416,4.957142857142857
2936377,3,B000VD5IAI,I have to agree with the other reviewers.  We have the first two Pingu DVD's and this one is not the same.  It seems to be slicker....I miss the old Pingu with the original music and the clunkier animation.  This one doesn't have nearly the charm.,1203638400,18,247,4.326086956521739
2936378,3,B000VD5IAI,Everyone that has seen the first two Pingus movies (ages 3 to 52) has really liked them a lot.  This new one wasn't recieved as well.  Its much faster paced and Pingu is not as sweet as he used to be.,1203292800,15,200,3.8536585365853657
2936379,3,B000VD5IAI,"I am no Pingu expert. I own one of the first Pingu DVDs and my kids love it. But something has happened to Pingu since. The whole ""feel"" of the cartoon has changed. It is as if it underwent some ""hollywoodization"". I wonder if the franchise has changed owners since. There seem to be more frequent cuts, the scenes change in a more rapid sequence, the characters are moving faster, seem to be less ""cute"", becoming more of ""action characters"". I miss the the old Pingu.",1201824000,36,469,4.465116279069767
2936380,5,B000VD5IAI,"pingu is delightful in all of his movies.my granddaughter adores him.the show is funny and pingu learns a lesson in most of them about taking care of his little sister,to be a good friend etc..there is no particular language spoken,but it is really funny never the less.",1401753600,,270,4.76595744680851

2936382,4,B000VD5IAI,Even with the different language these characters are easy to understand and very entertaining for young children. Can't wait to find more videos of this quality.,1387238400,,162,5.269230769230769
2936383,2,B000VD5IAI,"Love Pingu at our house. The cartoon itself is worth 5 stars. The price is the reason I gave the low star rating. Very disappointed that it is no longer offered as an Amazon Prime video. My granddaughter loved to watch this every night. She started watching another show for awhile and wanted to return to watching Pingu, only to discover it was no longer a free option. I don't think this is worth the $10 that it is selling for. There are a lot of other kids dvd's out there that are great for kids at half the price. I did give it two stars because it did bring a lot of smiles to a 3 year old.",1385164800,,597,4.025210084033613
2936384,5,B000VD5IAI,"This is so darn cute and amazes me how much my grandson, age 3 3/4, so enjoys it.  There is no language but is totally entertaining by simply watching the action.  It encourages his imagination, no foul or unacceptable language to worry about ----- just wonderful entertainment.",1379289600,,278,4.8936170212765955
2936385,5,B000VD5IAI,"I don't particularly care for this show being that no words are ever expressed.  I find it extemely silly but my kids will sit through the whole thing without even blinking an eye.  For that reason alone, I give it a high rating.  My kids are 6, 5 1/2 and 5.",1378944000,,258,4.019607843137255

2936387,2,B000VD5IAI,"My grand-daughter didn't care for it very slow, extremely slow for an adult watching with a grandchild.  Not worth even trying to watch we only watched for 10 minutes.",1376352000,,167,4.758620689655173

2936390,5,B000VD5IAI,This one in particular really catches my two year olds attention because Pingu is in a quarrel with a seal.,1373760000,,107,4.4

2936392,5,B000VD5IAI,"My 5 and 2 year old laughed and giggled throughout the rental. It's simple and cute animation. No words, just music and silly scenarios. But the kids loved it.",1372550400,,159,4.517241379310345
2936393,5,B000VD5IAI,"My kids and I love Pingu! Very clever and cute. We have watched every episode we could find during our limited TV time. Also very interesting developmentally because viewers have to figure out the story from the context, unless of course they speak fluent 'penguinese.'

One reviewer said their 2 year old did not pay attention, but why in the heck was he/she letting a two year old watch TV? Two year olds can't pay attention to anything anyway.",1371859200,,446,4.6455696202531644

2936396,3,B000VD5IAI,My grandson is almost 2 years old and watched it on and off during the time it played. It didn't capture his attention for too long.,1368144000,,132,4.115384615384615
2936397,5,B000VD5IAI,Really fun and creative claymation.  Fun to see them work together to solve problems. This was our first time connecting with Amazon video and it worked well.,1368144000,,158,4.851851851851852

2936407,2,B000VD5IAI,I thought this movie was dumb. I got it for my granddaughter who is 4. She didn't seem to care for it either. I turned it off before it was over and she has not asked to finish watching it.,1365292800,,189,3.75

2936411,4,B000VD5IAI,my kids love these little videos. we stream them over amazon prime and the short length of videos make it easy to put one or two on at a time.  They can finish an episode without having a meltdown,1364169600,,196,4.0256410256410255

2936417,5,B000VD5IAI,Great for kids of all ages! I loved Pingu when I was little now my kids love him. Even though he doesn't actually talk Pingu os still better than most of the crappy kids programs out there ;),1362182400,,191,4.052631578947368
2936418,5,B000VD5IAI,"Great movies for kids of any age (including ""big"" ones).  I love Pingu because there is no spoken dialog, so little imaginations still get to work through the stories and make decisions about what is happening and what the characters might do next.",1362182400,,248,4.767441860465116

2936423,5,B000VD5IAI,"I had my 2 year old grandson spend a few days with me and we ran across ""Pingu"" on Amazon and decided to check it out.  Not only did it capitivate him but it did me as well.

2936425,3,B000VD5IAI,"I was used to watching ""Meet Pingu"" and ""Chillin' with Pingu"" with my little girl. I thought we could use a change, so we watched ""On Thin Ice."" The first two we could watch over and over again. My little girl didn't care that it was the same thing over and over, and surprisingly, neither did I. I still smiled at the same parts, still laughed, still said, ""aw!"" during the sweet moments. I don't even know how to explain all the changes that occurred for ""On Thin Ice."" I didn't feel anything. None of the stories evoked any response in me at all. Soulless and hollow. That wasn't the Pingu we'd grown to love. So, please, if you're going to get just one or two Pingu DVDs, avoid ""On Thin Ice"" and go for the best.",1298937600,4,716,4.233576642335766

2936427,5,B000VD5IAI,Pingu is great for little ones. Actions speak louder than words and these short cartoons are quite entertaining and very well done. Kudos to the creators of it.,1256860800,,160,4.75

I know some people complain about how the video starts, or the lack of extras, but my son is no cinema snob; he pops it in and laughs for half an hour or so.  He likes to watch it again and again, it goes away for a month, and then comes out for a few more weeks.  It is funny, well done, clean and there are no adverts.",1252713600,,530,4.0095238095238095

I know some people are not big fans of the newer style of animation, but its what my kids are familiar with and they enjoy it more. This is a series of shorter clips or stories about Pingu and his family. No one talks just jibber jabber noises. Pingu is a typical kid avoiding things like 'gross foods' and only eating the things he likes. He does fun things with his family like enter an ice sculpture contest. Overall, its good clean fun. Nothing too intense or scary. Some kid mischief, but things like hiding his vegetables and lying is later revealed and dealt with in the family.",1473120000,,661,4.426229508196721

While it's a cute and appropriate for young children film, there's no language, just jibberish.

I noticed it is the same way with a lot of Kids shows on Amazon. Until they start offering these as part of the subscription, I don't see how Amazon Instant Video can compete with Netflix, especially in regards to Kids programming.

Hope this helps if you're trying to decide between the two services for your little one.",1415404800,2,518,4.385416666666667
