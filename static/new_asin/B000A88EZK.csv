Not sure if it's a Pleasantville Syndrome [reminders of a kinder, gentler age], or my current inability to make sense of a world gone strange, but it's been very enjoyable to view these time capsules.

This is a great collection of old shows [You Bet Your Life, Beat The Clock, Masquerade Party, and other 50's gems] that TV guide advertises as ""The Original Reality TV Shows"" and that's not a far stretch.

Of particular interest for collectors, should be the inclusion of the show ""21"" on this group of DVD's.  It is THE show, that shows the contestant Mr. Stemple losing to Mr. Van Doren, on which the motion picture ""Quiz Show"" directed by Robert Redford was based.

Essentially, Mr. Stemple had been given the answers to the show for some time, and then they decided to give Mr. Van Doren the answers and make him the long running winner.  Mr. Stemple feeling it is a matter of anti-semitism, notifies authorities that the show was fixed, which resulted in a congressional hearing.

That very show, wherein Mr. Stemple finally loses his ""winning streak"" is in this collection.  It was after this show that Mr. Stemple would notify authorities.  Also of peculiar interest is when [Mr. Stemple] is asked a question whether he understood a detail on how something was computed or worked, and what he says in response seems to be electronically deleted:  they run a signal OVER what he says on the show, so you can't hear what he is saying - I found that remarkable.

Of additional interest is seeing Mr. Van Doren wracking his brain thinking of answers when you know, in reality, he was already given the answers or was being fed the answers through headphones - this is just mindboggling to view!

Outside of that - this is a great collection.  Original ads and commercials are kept intact which make this an even better collection.  At the bargain basement price listed, if you're into classic television:  this belongs in your collection!",1153872000,8,2110,4.726775956284153
