8520144,3,B005LJJ67I,"I saw this film (Le gendarme et les gendarmettes) dubbed in Hungarian on a DVD.  It concerns a set of 6 bumbling cops who receive a computer (the film is originally from 1982) and are also mandated to help train four female cadets.  It's not clear that any training whatsoever goes on, but the four cadets seem not to mind, either.  As the cadets start to be kidnapped, the police captain realizes that the situation is serious (since he'll be transferred if he does not safely recover the women), but it's not clear that this realization helps at all as the officers try to protect and free the cadets.

My take is that this is the French version of slapstick.  I enjoyed the film chiefly for the unintended reflections on how things were at the time (unintended meaning so natural at the time that the film didn't distort it, like when Roger Healey goes over to Tony Nelson's all the time in ""I Dream of Jeannie"" and the front door is never locked).  I thought the plot went from weak to flimsy by the end (ie. the kidnap motivation made no sense to me, and even less when it was explained at the end).",1502150400,,1104,4.387254901960785
