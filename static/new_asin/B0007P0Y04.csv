The Dick Tracy comic strip began around 1930 when Chester Gould created it for the Chicago Tribune. Its purpose was to influence public opinion to support the police in Chicago and elsewhere. It was liked by adults because of its cleverness and stories that appealed to the public. Its villains were famous for their distinctive features, a belief fostered by some criminologists that is obsolete. It met the wants of its audiences (fighting crime in the city). There was no mention of corrupt politicians or similar scandals. The Shadow was a popular radio program in the 19230s-1940s that featured Lamont Cranston, a man who worked undercover to fight crime. Refer to the individual reviews for more details.
