8427786,1,B00070JWFW,"Old Engine good.  905 Wild bad...very bad. Without doubt, 905 Wild is the worst Emergency episode ever made.  Jack Webb wanted to spin off a series about L.A. animal control officers.  He used Emergency to try it.  Basically, unplug the human victims from a typical Emergency episode, and insert animals as the victims.  Wrong.  Didn't work.  Some of the worst writing ever.  Veteran actors trying to look truly concerned for a baby goat on the operating table.  New uninteresting characters trying to create pathos from dealing with animals.  Every time the camera panned to the baby goat with an oxygen tube sticking out of its mouth, you have to suppress a laugh.  In fact, laugh suppression is the primary experience in viewing this episode.  Animal Control, while a humane government undertaking, is simply not a dramatic subject.  The typical animal life show on TV is more fitting.  Nowadays, though, with the elevation of animals onto the same plane with humans, this show might have led to a #1 rated TV show.  Otherwise, see if the seller will give a 50% discount.",1274140800,,1074,4.856353591160221
