1420876,1,B00005B6JW,"This blaxtoiplation film is par for the course; very comical these days, and great for the ""so bad its good"" crowd. Although a film like this is good for the Dolemite crowd, the DVD's poor authoring make this a problem. For starters, the DVD has a very diffuse, poorly recorded soundtrack. Instead of keeping the film in mono and the center channel, it sounds like the authors thought it would be clever to spread the sound over all five speakers. The net result is an odd diffuse sound that is only corrected when you turn Dolby encoding off. The video quality is watchable - but scratched and with muted colors. Lesser titles have gotten much better treatment then this.
I don't mind the minimal extras, and a title like this doesn't deserve restoration and all that jazz. But the transfer of the film is so below par, I'd say skip the film unless you really need to spend $... that bad.",1009670400,16,889,4.527950310559007
1420877,3,B00005B6JW,"It looks and sounds like a fifth generation dub of a vhs tape, but it's still fun to watch. Nobody here can act and they apparently improvised the fights on the spot. You betcha, this is MST3K type fun. It's worth it for the Casper the Ghost cartoon alone. When's the last time you saw a full-length cartoon before a movie?

1420878,2,B00005B6JW,"Roger Corman's New World Pictures combines blaxploitation with chop-sockey in this 1975 exploitation film that was directed by Cirio Santiago, a Filipino director who did a number of films for Corman.  The plot is simple; Diana ""TNT"" Jackson avenges her brother's murder and becomes involved with drug dealers, including Stan Shaw, who sports a huge Afro and wears a 70s era pimp wardrobe throughout the film.  Jeanne Bell portrays TNT Jackson . . . she can't act and her kung-fu moves are laughable as she chops and kicks various Filipino and Chinese extras.  In fact, almost all of the kung-fu scenes are among the worst choreographed fight scenes ever filmed.  Viewed today, this film is unitentionally funny and might make a good party DVD, though there is some nudity and coarse language, reflecting the film's exploitation roots.
The running time listed on this Brentwood Communications release says 90 minutes, but the film runs just over 70 minutes.  Unfortunately, the print used by Brentwood is not good . . . numerous scratches and artifacts are found throughout the film and the soundtrack is poorly recorded; you'll have to crank your volume up to hear the dialog.  Brentwood also includes a few extras on their budget DVDs, including a ""Casper, the Friendly Ghost"" cartoon, an interactive movie trivia game, a dictionary of DVD terms, 6 chapter stops for the film, and a special internet connection for those viewers having a DVD-ROM equipped on their computer.  Not a bad deal for five bucks.",995414400,16,1507,5.004

1420880,5,B00005B6JW,"I viewed this film as a child,now as an adult and love it just the same. It entails a SISTA's revenge of her brother and reviews the fact that you can't trust anyone. In one scene the heroine almost fell in love but her  true reasons for being in the movie prevailed. In the end she put up a  great and outstanding FIGHT. This movie was dynomite and a must see.",961372800,,361,4.070422535211268

1420892,5,B00005B6JW,I liked this movie I had ever heard of this before but I am trying to buy at lot of movies from the 70's and this was worth the price and a good movie.  Overall I enjoyed the movie and I will continue to add to my collection of 1970 movies.,1322438400,2,240,3.7058823529411766
1420893,2,B00005B6JW,"I'm not rating this movie based on the acting. I knew going into it that this wasn't going to be a piece of 'high-art' film-making.

I am giving this movie a 2-star rating , however, because the transfer is very poor quality. The producers of the DVD made no attempts to clean up the film and it is riddled with scratches from the original filmstock. Also, the sound quality is extremely bad. I have to practically turn the volume all the way up just to hear what the actors are saying, but then I also get a lot of 'hiss' from the speakers for doing that.

As a 70's era Blaxploitation movie it's adequate. Not one of the best examples certainly, but I've seen worse.

It's probably not going to get a better release than this, so if you're into these types of movies just be advised that this DVD transfer is very inferior quality.",1296086400,2,833,4.361290322580645
1420894,1,B00005B6JW,"""TNT"" is really an incredibly bad movie, and there is no reason I can give you why you should prefer this one over any other Blaxploitation flick of your random choice. The sound- and picture quality are lousy/dreadful..the actors are implausible and the story is.....One could really tear one's hair!",1273622400,2,301,5.04
1420895,3,B00005B6JW,"The movie is okay. It has it's good points; Jeanne Bell, who is very attractive and has a topless karate fight at one point in the movie and the character Charlie who is one of the coolest characters ever in motion pictures! It has it's moments of great dialog and some pretty humorous attempts at kung-fu fighting. The sets and wardrobe are great!

And some bad points, but I won't get into those here. If you're familiar with exploitation movies from the 70's, you know not to expect cinematic genius in most cases.

This is not a Jack Hill/Pam Grier/Sid Haig flick, so don't expect the greatness present in Coffy or Foxy Brown. Its not as cool or quirky as those movies, but it's not as bad as some I've seen either.

The presentation is not too great; a sometimes too dark print in widescreen but again it's not as bad as some I've seen. I only paid a dollar for mine, so I'm okay with it.",1260144000,,893,4.335329341317365
1420896,3,B00005B6JW,"Jeanne (Jeannie) Bell is Diana ""TNT"" Jackson, a karate expert on a mission to avenge her brother's death amidst the gangs and drug dealers of Hong Kong. TNT arrives and realizes that she will need to go undercover to penetrate the drug gang that's responsible for her brother's death. Naturally, being that Bell was the October 1969 Playboy Playmate of the Month, she agrees to pose as a prostitute and quickly finds herself involved with a very young Stan Shaw. Shaw (Toomer from ""The Great Santini""), who is an extremely gifted actor, is seen here in an absolutely stupendous afro and unreal polyester clothes that are half the entertainment of the film. Shaw is aiming to become big in the mob and sees TNT as an asset. There is disagreement about her value within the organization when heroin shipments start getting hijacked, leading to no end of dramatic confrontations.

The film is an excuse to show Bell doing karate on mobsters and tons of Asian extras. Probably half the running time is taken up with karate scenes of dubious quality. Bell is a pretty woman, but not exceptionally talented in martial arts. The fight scenes are amusingly choreographed and lack a certain amount of credibility. OK, who am I fooling? They are laughable and ridiculous, but they provide the other half of the entertainment value the film yields.

The story is straightforward and predictable, the acting is sub par (Shaw does well with questionable material), and the quality of the DVD recording is not very good, as it has a lot of surface flaws and poor color balance. Still, the fight scenes are entertaining (albeit not in the intended way), and the film does have a satisfying (if predictable) conclusion after Bell and Shaw engage in fisticuffs for an exceedingly long time. It's only 72 minutes long, so there's not enough time to get too bored (although the native dancing toward the end started to approach the boredom threshold), making it a brainless, fun flashback to the 1970's.",1224028800,2,1984,4.866863905325443

7936695,2,B00005B6JW,"The film opens with traditional Chinese ceremony being performed to ""whack-a-da"" music to an audience of black people. TNT (Jeanie Bell) is attempting to locate her missing brother and ends up finding out his killers were heroin dealers. The movie has the uppity black woman using era phrases like ""dig it"" and ""tell is like it is."" It is a part of town where you can't walk down the street without engaging in a karate fight. The best fighters are those that can make their fingers look the most crooked and broken. TNT has a body double thick in the waist do her back flips. The production includes a classic ripped open blouse scene and ridiculous in the dark fight that follows.
