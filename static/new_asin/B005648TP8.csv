8459185,5,B005648TP8,"Ordeal by Fire is a magnificent production of a significant event that has impacted the entire U.S. for over a century.  George Sibley's detailed descriptions and marvelous video ""capture the moment"" of what it must have felt like to those who lived through the 1910 Fires.  It is entertaining, captivating, realistic and downright five star entertainment for the entire family.  Sibley interviewed descendants of the 1910 Fire, and meticulously crafted a fine story.
This is a wonderful gift that tells the story of the biggest fire in the Northwest!
