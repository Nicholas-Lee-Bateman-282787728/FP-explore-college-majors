7910805,5,B00000ILBB,"This DVD is a delight for aviation and travel buffs. It covers the flights of a Junkers JU-52, a classic tri-motor airliner of the 1930's still in operation in Switzerland. You'll find yourself flying over the glaciers, mountains, valleys and lakes of Switzerland listening to the drone of 3 BMW engines. Even the seemingly mundane tasks of an engine over-haul and refueling are fascinating to watch. I highly recommend this DVD for those who enjoy the aircraft and air travel from the Golden Age of Aviation.",983059200,6,509,4.930232558139535
