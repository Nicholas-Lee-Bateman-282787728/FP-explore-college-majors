7877880,3,6304828993,This tape is divided into three segments but there isn't any kind of guidelines of how we are supposed to use it and how many times a week. Because it's not a normal weight workout it should give that kind of information.,994982400,2,221,4.285714285714286
7877881,5,6304828993,"I don't think anyone else has had the common sense or compassion to make a video like this. I am very pleased with the quality of instruction and filming. This isn't an aerobics video.  It's a prevention video. It  instructs you how to strengten and keep mobile. The exercises are geared to  work: joints, muscles and tendons. Having strength and flexibilty in all  these areas eliminates unnecessary injury. Good going, Reebok!",935366400,4,428,4.985915492957746
7877882,1,6304828993,"This is the mosr disappointing of the Reebok exercise videos, in my opinion. It contains little or no challenge. It is difficult to see how these ""exercises"" could provide even minimal training for the average person. I, a 59 year old woman, found this video to be a complete waste of time and money. The younger and stronger among us will surely want to look elsewhere for strength training. Look to Cindy Crawford, to Gilad, to The Firm. Forget this one!",913420800,2,456,4.6419753086419755
