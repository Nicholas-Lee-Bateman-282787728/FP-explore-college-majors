6255900,4,B00IARA8FM,"Ash (Dean Norris) and Al Klein (Christopher Meloni) own a successful used car dealership that took a long time to get there. During that time Al got divorced from his wife Barbara (Bridget Moynahan) who sought security for their son Fred (Devon Bostick). Fred is now 18 years old and has a chance to go to Cal-Poly but would rather learn the used car trade from the father figure he missed growing up. This causes issues that only Al can work out.

This is a heart warming comedy for a mature family. The humor is not over powering, but it does work. The characters are flawed, but Al accepts this fact in other people more easily than they accept it in him. It has a happy ending and is something that approaches a Lifetime film minus the Puffs.

The film is ""R"" rated but contained no F-bombs, sex, or nudity.  The sex references were sparse, but apparently coarse enough for the rating.  I have seen PG-13 films far more crude.  Solid 4 stars.",1401062400,,946,4.445086705202312
6255901,5,B00IARA8FM,"Inspired by a true story, SMALL TIME is a sweet, charming, quite funny family comedy, written and directed by Joel Surnow, and featuring a cast of capable actors whose faces are well familiar to television audiences.

Christopher Meloni stars as the co-owner (with Dean Norris) of a small used car lot.  These two guys, with a staff that includes a mechanic/Spanish-speaking salesman (Amaury Nolasco) and a less than bright office girl (Ashley Jensen), are experts at selling vehicles off their lot, even to the most reluctant buyer.

Things change when Melonis son (Devon Bostick), against his mothers wishes, decides to forego college and come to work with his father.  The teenager had lived with his mother (Bridget Moynahan) and her wealthy husband (Xander Berkeley) for most of his life.  Now, he wants to move in with and get to know his father.  The youth quickly transforms from an innocent young man into a brash seasoned car salesman, which becomes troublesome for Meloni.

SMALL TIME may be a small movie, but it is also a touching film, enhanced by clever writing and solid performances from actors (e.g. Meloni, Norris) who you don't often see in these kinds of soft roles.

The Blu-Ray is from Anchor Bay Entertainment.

Not sure if that was intended by the director, just a poor casting job of the actor, or if the main two headliners are just SO GOOD (which they are) they make someone else in a scene with them look mediocre.

Still greatly enjoyable film that has a story and feeling a lot of people can relate to in some way or another.",1415059200,,429,4.156626506024097

6255912,3,B00IARA8FM,This is a story of two films that uncomfortably try to coexist.  The first one about the used car business is quite good in explaining the intricacies of the trade and how to sell a product to a customer who may not need it or particularly want it.  The family drama that takes up the heft of the film is somewhat lacking.  It concerns a father trying to reconnect with a son after the kid's high school graduation by bringing him into the family business.  Christopher Meloni is good as the father but Devon Bostick as the son leaves a lot to be desired.  Bostick is one of those kid actors who are trying to transition into adult roles and making a mess of it.  Bostick is so annoying and obnoxious that you want Meloni to convince the kid to go to Cal-Poly like he originally intended.  What I would have liked to have seen is more time given to the relationship between Meloni and his African-American girlfriend which is left totally undeveloped.  The film also purports to be a nostalgia piece and I guess it was set in the Nineties but the film has no sense of any time and place whatsoever.  Not a complete waste of time though the film has a movie-of-the-week feel to it.,1410048000,,1180,4.376146788990826

6255919,4,B00IARA8FM,"I enjoyed this movie.  I liked the characters (I like the actors!), I liked the story.  It was just a feel-good movie.

(But did anyone notice the phones of this movie?  Not one person had a cell phone.  There were many phones with the curly-q cords attaching the receiver to the base.  And the cordless phone was old-school with the really long antenna that one had to pull out of the receiver.  This movie was made in 2013 (released in 2014), why were there such old style phones?)",1404604800,,483,4.420454545454546
6255920,4,B00IARA8FM,"Me renting ""Small Time"" after some late night On Demand surfing wasn't because I read ""coming-of-age"" in the synopsis. Films of that nature tend to thrive on performances alone and follow a very structured, very calculated formula that rarely brings ingenuity or surprise to the table. What brought me to this independent ""coming-of-age"" flick were two other things mentioned in the synopsis: the fact that it was set at a used car lot and starred ""Breaking Bad's"" Dean Norris as something other than a cop. Coming from a car business background myself and being a fan of Norris, watching ""Small Time"" seemed like a match made in cinema heaven. And, surprisingly, the experimental decision lead me to a satisfying one.

The story follows Al Klein (Christopher Meloni) and Ash Martini (Dean Norris), two longtime friends who own a used car lot. When Al's son Freddy (Devon Bostick) graduates from high school and decides to put college on hold for a summer selling cars with his old man, against the better wishes of his mother (Bridget Moynahan), Al has to make some tough choices to shape both Freddy's future and his own.

One of the film's strongest points are its characters and their relationships. For a movie that's less than 95 minutes long, it does an impeccable job of establishing histories and catching you up on the moment. The chemistry between Christopher Meloni and Dean Norris, Meloni and Bostick, Meloni and Moynahan- are all first rate and immediately believable. Credit belongs to the script (penned by Joel Surnow with semi-autobiographical experience) and to the actors who sell it. These are a cast of characters who are difficult to leave behind once the credits roll.

Another thing ""Small Time"" gets right is the business. The hilarious sales tactics on display here are at times a bit over the top, but are, nevertheless, versions of tactics that are as used as the cars they're peddling. The camaraderie between Meloni and Norris during these exchanges is also highly contagious; selling cars like its a two-on-one basketball game won by assists rather than hogging the ball. As a newcomer to the business, Devon Bostick nails it, transitioning from clueless bystander to over-his-head douche bag rather seamlessly.

As a member of the ""coming-of-age"" genre, however, ""Small Time"" does indeed follow a structure designed to eliminate surprise. The story goes where you expect it to and despite being well-acted and set where not a lot of other films bother to spend their time, there are a handful of moments that give off a very sitcomy feel (not to say that this wouldn't make for a good one, by the way, but when you're a 'movie' for a better portion of the running time, being anything else for even a second can be distracting). There's also the nit-picking issue of newer cars cruising the streets of a 1970's Covina, California, but that's the problem with small-budget movies I suppose- it costs money to keep the outside world from getting into your inside one.

Minor gripes aside, ""Small Time"" has a bigger impact than its title suggests. It's funny, filled with some wonderfully drawn, wonderfully acted characters, and has a heart that's effectively exposed throughout its short running time; never once treading on manipulative and always genuine.

SCORE: B+

6255924,5,B00IARA8FM,"Every once in a while a small film is released that goes unnoticed by most and yet deserves so much more attention than many of the flashier big name titles that tend to take up 3-4 screens at the local multiplex. Often these films are filled with heart and emotion and steer clear of all the combinations of mega-explosions and special effects. They are films to be treasured and sought out. So let me guide you to one called SMALL TIME.

Christopher Maloni stars as Al Klein, a used car salesman who's feeling older with each passing day. Along with his best friend Ash Martini (Dean Norris) they do great business at the lot. But it's his personal life that Al finds upsetting, filled with regrets. None of those is bigger than the life he couldn't provide for his ex-wife (Bridget Moynihan) and son Freddy (Devon Bostick).

On his son's graduation day from high school, Al and Ash try to make sure they're there on time. Alas it isn't so but, being the great salesmen they are, they fake their way through it. A clear bond between Al and his son is shown here in subtle ways that only deepen as the film moves forward. This is plain to see when Freddy shows up to talk to Al about the possibility of going to work for him. While his mother wants him to go to college, he feels he can learn more about the real world working for his father.

While the parents disagree on this concept, his mother ends up allowing him to follow through with the plan. Freddy moves in with Al and the two find themselves catching up on lost time. His first days at the car lot are filled with mistakes and fumbles and a few lost sales. But this turns as his time at the lot progresses.

But as Freddy's sales skills increase so does his disrespect for the people he deals with as well as those around him. Al seems to be the only one who notices this. Having lost the only thing that mattered to him all those years ago, is he willing to let Freddy fall into the same lifestyle that costs him what was most important to him?

The movie has a calm cool atmosphere to it, moving along at a steady pace that allows the story to unfold in a manner that suits it well. Some might see the change in Freddy as fast but in truth it's just that the storytelling going on here is so seamless that it only feels that way. The combination of script, directing and acting come together here so perfectly fit that it feels the movie is over before it began. It leaves you wishing you could see what happens down the line.

The three male leads here all do an amazing job. Meloni is a master of playing things close to the chest, never revealing all that his character has going on inside of his mind with wasted words. Instead he offers ponderous gazes that convey everything we need to know. Norris turns in another great performance to match those of the past with his character being the more brazen and fun loving of the two. Ash is not someone looking down the line at what is to come but only in the here and now. Al and Ash are two sides of the coin that combine to make a single unit. Both have something to offer Freddy. The problem is Freddy realizing which is the most important and that the two can co-exist and should with neither wiping out the other. Bostick as Freddy does an equally great job with his character making him timid at first only to find himself swelling with far too much hubris later on.

Another great thing about this movie is the film's director and writer, Joel Surnow. Known by most for his creation of the series 24 he's also been a writer for years having worked on THE EQUALIZER, FALCON CREST, LA FEMME NIKITA, THE COMMISH and MIAMI VICE. Now he takes a turn at something a little different and does an amazing job.

There are plenty of laughs in this film and a number of tender moments as well. It's that combination of the two that make this a film worth watching. It's a film that could be shared between a father and son that would lead to a great conversation. It might have not been a box office smash, but it is a movie that needs to be seen.",1403654400,,4061,4.299346405228758

6255928,4,B00IARA8FM,"Small Time is the story of Al Klein (Christopher Meloni, Law & Order: SVU) and his longtime friend, Ash Martini (Dean Norris, Breaking Bad). These two own a used car lot and know every trick in the book when it comes to selling cars. Ash has lived a carefree life, never really settling down. Al still has feelings for his ex-wife, Barbara (Bridget Moynahan, Blue Bloods), who left him years ago for a more successful man. After graduating from high school, their son, Freddy (Devon Bostick, Diary of a Wimpy Kid), decides to forgo college in favor of selling cars with his old man. Al is thrilled when Freddy moves in with him. Its the first time the two have lived under one roof since Freddy was a kid. Barbara, however, isn't at all pleased. She is concerned that whats best for Al might not be best for their son, as Freddy quickly transforms from innocent kid into a seasoned shark.

This is the first big-screen effort from Joel Surnow (TVs 24), who wrote the screenplay and directed. Surnow has based it film at least in part on personal experience. He worked into his mid-twenties with his father as a carpet salesman. With a cast mostly of TV actors, this comedy/drama is appealing in its colorful assortment of characters, but structurally there are problems.

Freddys transition from awkward novice in the used car business to fast-talking sharpie occurs too quickly to be believable. Overall, however, the movie effectively shows the developing relationship between a father and son getting to know each other for the first time. This kind of movie  about real people with real problems  is being overshadowed these days by superheroes, alien invasions, and computer-fueled spectacles. Small Time is a refreshing return to character-driven movies.

8640468,2,B00IARA8FM,"Small Time just doesn't provide enough excitement to recommend.  It's about a teenager (Devon Bostick) who just graduated from high school, and his career goal is to become a car salesman and work the business with his father.  Devon doesn't want to go to college much to the dissatisfaction of his mother (Bridget Moynahan).  Bridget takes it very personally that her son prefers the car salesmen business no doubt because she's divorced from Christopher and remembers the hard times they've had keeping the business going and the small amount of income rolling in.  She wants her son to do something more productive with his life.  This takes up a good portion of the story in the first half, and Devon working the business takes up the second half.  It's not much believe me.

The movie sort of makes being a car salesman seem like a bum job which is completely untrue.  I'd never be able to be a car salesman.  Not in a million years.  You have to be approachable, talkative, use creative wording in order to get people to buy your vehicles, make friendly conversation, understand the vehicle you're selling, etc (though surprisingly Devon doesn't seem to know much about vehicles and still makes it work).  All characteristics I completely lack. Christopher Meloni even mentions during a conversation with Devon how simple it is to be a car salesman, even though initially Devon disagrees and think it's a difficult job... until he gets good at it.

And that's the basis of the story- Devon gets good at being a car salesman, and eventually turns arrogant, controlling, critical and belittles his fellow employees and treats people like dirt.  This is a family type movie, in this case showing a son the proper way to run a business.  ""You shouldn't treat people that way"".  When Christopher begins to realize how this job is negatively affecting his sons attitude, this is when the only good moments of the story occur.  The problem is that the entire movie is *really* quiet.  It's very drama-focused and way too short overall.  I wouldn't call the drama very compelling either.  The comedy only comes from one-liners whenever Christopher Meloni and his buddies get together at the car dealership.  Otherwise Garcelle Beauvais, the woman who plays Christopher's girlfriend or good friend, should have been given more segments because her presence felt incomplete.

Besides Devon acting arrogant and learning the car salesman business, this movie is really slow.  Christopher Meloni's a good fit in Law & Order.  Maybe he should stick to that.",1439078400,,2549,4.945882352941177
