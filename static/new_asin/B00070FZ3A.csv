I remember that feeling of getting into deep thought about the characters, the sand, the words, the bird seeds, Everything lol. It's funny how fast life goes but I will definitely recommend this program for toddlers through 3rd grade.",1373760000,,358,4.523076923076923
8044413,1,B00070FZ3A,"A film that had some potential - pointing out the foibles of both the Americans and the French - quickly dissolves into a distasteful and annoying stew of one cliche after another - the vulgar and ugly Americans, the arrogant French, the spoiled daughter, etc., with some of the scenes being downright embarrassing. Even the usually reliable Gerard Depardieu may start out with an energetic and engaging performance, but he too soon succumbs to a terrible screen play. How this won both Best Film and Best screenplay at Venice, and how this could be the product of the great French New Wave director Alain Resnais (Hiroshima Mon Amour, Last Year At Marienbad, Providence)  are enigmas that will not soon be solved.",1346198400,2,714,4.900826446280992
8044414,2,B00070FZ3A,"It's hard to believe that this pathetic thing was directed by the same Alain Resnais as the one who directed other wonderful films, such as 'Providence', and 'Last Year at Marienbad'.  The wonderful performances of Gerard Depardieu, Micheline Presle, and Linda Lavin cannot carry the extremely grating and annoying performance of Adolph Green.  No bad acting, no matter how putrescent, can do justice to the ridiculous and vulgarly scripted role of Joey Wellman.  Linda Lavin does a good job trying to redeem the American characters, but Laura Benson's wooden acting complements Green's crude balsa wood lampooning of Americans.  Depardieu, Presle, and Lavin are evanescent, all the more so in the dim company of Green and Benson, but, unfortunately, do not take up enough screen time to keep this film above water, much as it pains me to write this about any Resnais film.

Let's hope for a Criterion Blu-ray edition of the wonderful 'Providence' to offset the damage done to Resnais' reputation by this poor film.",1311033600,2,1015,5.090361445783133
