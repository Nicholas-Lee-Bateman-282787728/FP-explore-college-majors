2676114,2,B000JLSPT8,It is short.  It goes too fast.  I was hoping it would show people speaking Spanish in real life situations instead of just of just a screen showing the Spanish word and pronouncing it.  It does not cover much material for a whole DVD.  I was disappointed.,1363305600,8,256,4.382978723404255
2676115,5,B000JLSPT8,"If you are looking for entertainment or a video to show a class, look elsewhere.  If you grasp vocabulary and sound easily in learning a language, skip this DVD.

If you find learning a new language challenging, are struggling to learn Spanish from scratch, or need repetition and reinforcement, buy this DVD!

This DVD provides visuals of the words while a Spanish speaker says them.  This DVD is one more tool to help you remember the spelling, accents, and sounds of what you're trying to learn.

I am taking a college course in beginning Spanish because I want to learn the language.  When I asked the Spanish department head how best to learn, she suggested using everything possible.  So, I have in-class instruction, use online course materials, use my textbook, watch the Spanish cable tv news, view animated films (set to Spanish), practice with flash cards, and listen to CDs in the car.  I have this DVD in a tv player in my bedroon so I can play the video before bed, when I'm getting ready in the morning, and other spare moments.

I've checked out every CD available through my library, and I have difficulty with many ""introductory"" sources being too advanced or there's not enough pausing for me to practice aloud.  Because of the pace and clarity of the sound on ""Learn Spanish: Level 1,"" it's easier to listen to than most of the CDs designed just for listening.  And if I sit down and watch, there are the words shown clearly and in color on the screen.

I will play this CD daily until I have mastery, and I ordered level 2.  I like it!",1296086400,43,1556,4.553956834532374
2676116,5,B000JLSPT8,This dvd is a great learning tool for anyone who would like to learn to speak Spanish!  Highly recommended!!!,1290988800,5,109,4.7368421052631575
2676117,4,B000JLSPT8,"I have used this video with a group of adults who have a desire to learn Spanish, but also have mild to moderate mental handicaps.  The pictures and repetion of vocabulary is great for all of us learning Spanish.  The program is great because it uses up to date pictures and is not childish, although could be used with children (maybe 8 years and up) interested in learning Spanish.  Level 1 teaches the alphabet with the use of pictures, good basic vocabulary.",1210464000,14,462,4.609756097560975

2676119,1,B000JLSPT8,I was looking for material that could be used with Middle/High school students. This DVD is entirely too slow to be used with them. An individual may have the patience to use it but even then it is not very helpful for learning.,1188950400,9,228,4.325581395348837

8151848,3,B000JLSPT8,"It says BEGINNER. I read comments saying it was not ideal for them, but for a beginner it would be.
And I'm about to become one of those people.
This DVD is the BASICS at a very very regulated pace. It is a bit too slow for my taste, I would prefer repetition. But if you learn gradually, and are JUST STARTING, this would be fine for you.",1421107200,2,339,4.0

8151852,5,B000JLSPT8,"Very good for the very beginner, which I am a beginner. Covers ABC's, counting, colors, greetings, grammar, If you have passed first year Spanish then you don't need it. For people like me who know nothing about Spanish, then get it and watch it over and over. I will be getting the other two DVDs. Just want to add one other thing. I started to take a first year Spanish program and it was assumed we knew the Alphabet and other basics. So I dropped out and will return when I have a sound foundation for speaking and reading Spanish.",1403481600,,535,4.36

  I like learning Spanish  because is easier than learning French. t is my Third language.  Is my second favorite language to learn.

  I will recommend it to lots of people and I will give five stars.

  Thank you,
