4841896,2,B005N10I30,"Music sucks, main character is a bit of a d-bag. Also should be called Cast South central since they never go farther than a couple hours from metro Anchorage. They only fish rainbows. They talk about how awesome they are because they fly fish, bash on bait guys and then use nothing but egg patterns and flesh flies, but its cool because they tie their own.
On a positive note it is in Alaska and the cinematography is well done, so yeah lots of great scenery. Just turn the volume off and enjoy the fishing.",1482537600,,509,4.368421052631579

As a female who fishes, I enjoyed this basic look at trout fishing in Alaska, and fly fishing in general, as did my other half. If nothing else, I got a good case of trout envy watching it LOL. I would have liked to have seen some more in depth information on fly tying, line choice, and basic rod/reel information included--I like to know what gear people use when getting the good ones.

I did like seeing the two different types of water craft in operation as well, as we have only owned kayaks in the past (ocean going varieties designed for fishing), and my broth-in-law has a bass boat. Hopefully, Amazon prime will add more in depth fishing films to the selections over time.",1437436800,,761,4.5144927536231885

4842011,2,B005N10I30,It starts off with some promise and even speaks of getting people outdoors with showing how everyone can enjoy fishing but this point quickly dwindles into annoying emo-punk rock music while attempts are made to catch rainbow trout.  Alaska has a lot more to offer when fishing on the fly and this film covers very little of the amazing species diversity present. I'm pro catch and release but this film makes you wonder if any of the participating individuals know what fish even tastes like. It's a boring film that shows little of what's really there.,1422057600,,554,4.770833333333333

4842028,5,B005N10I30,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. There was mention that it was only of Rainbow trout and I actually thought that was special because these fishers a unique breed in Alaska. It reminded me why I went on a trip to Kodiak Alaska from Vermont. The amazing fishing(silver salmon run), the animals,the wonderful people and the scenery. I would recommend this to everyone, fly-fisher or not. Great job",1402704000,2,402,4.926470588235294

Some great scenery and they do a good job of keeping true to the state, which is nice as a lot of the reality TV that's out there just doesn't do it justice.  I'd recommend this to anyone who loves fishing, Alaska or the great outdoors.

4842039,4,B005N10I30,"This superbly filmed and edited movie depicts rainbow trout fly fishing as it's done on the Kenai River and a smaller river in the Mat-Su area of Alaska. Although anglers not familiar with this kind of fishing might pick up a tip or two about indicator fishing with beads (egg patterns) and flesh flies, this film isn't about how the fish are being caught. Rather, it's about why people fish. To this end, the most compelling segment of the film is the opening story featuring husband and wife Dave and Bobbie Holsman, avid anglers whose fishing lifestyle allows them to build and share a reservoir of experiences and memories. Other stories in the film feature Dave Holsman teaming up with angling friends to pursue the fish of a lifetime: an elusive 30"" Kenai River rainbow. These are stories that will resonate with most anglers--and the cinematography, complete with soaring eagles, swans, bears, moose, big trout and lovely water filmed under autumn skies is sure to give viewers an itch to come and explore this great state. But there's an underlying problem with the subject itself. On both river systems, a number of otherwise beautiful trout that come to net have seriously damaged jaws--the result, no doubt, of fish being caught multiple times on barbed hooks and carelessly released. Happily, Holsman addresses this problem. Hopefully, more anglers will use small, barbless hooks when fishing for trout they don't intend to keep in the first place. This is a good film to watch on a cold winter day while dreaming of warm weather, new water and arced rods.",1325376000,3,1568,4.898496240601504

8480093,1,B005N10I30,i was drawn in by the title. but it soon left me wondering if this was about fishing or some dude that wanted to come clean to his girlfriend he really didn't want to spend time with her. either way not worth the brain cells only my thought,1522627200,,240,4.020833333333333
8480094,3,B005N10I30,Decent flick. The soundtrack is painful however. Imagine a 40-50 year old guy/gal catching the fish of a lifetime to the tune of a pop punk guy wining about his high school girlfriend. It's kind of silly but it ruined the movie for me. I was constantly cringing waiting for the next blast of pop punk in my face. About half-way through I turned it off.,1520553600,,352,4.348484848484849
