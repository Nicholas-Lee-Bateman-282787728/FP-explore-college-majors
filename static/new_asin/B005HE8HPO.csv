8472894,5,B005HE8HPO,"As a friend of the late Bob Palmer, one of the most intelligent, welcoming and perceptive people I've ever encountered, I found his daughter Augusta's portrait of Bob an a journalist, musician, man and mystic seeker entwined with her own journey to make peace with his difficult personal legacy incredibly affecting. As a film-maker, her weave of the parts of Bob's life - his high order music and journalism, his denial of the responsibilities of fatherhood and family, his quest for transcendence... -- come seamlessly together. I can only image how difficult this film was for her to make. It put tears in my eyes, not only for her pain but for Bob's. Under his command and intellectual ardor was a tortured interior that I only had glimpses at in his more self-destructive moments. For Augusta, I believe this film is also about finding understanding and forgiveness. And in no way does getting a glimpse into the deeper life of the ""real"" Robert Palmer diminish a note of his genius or accomplishments, which had the power to change lives, including mine.  ALL THAT SAID, THIS IS AN EXTREMELY MUSICAL MOVIE - and perhaps the best look inside the world of the Master Musicians of Joujouka, with whom Bob experienced a great personal and spiritual awakening. Augusta's journey to Morocco to understand Bob's experiences there plunges her and her fellow travelers into a deep musical, cultural and spiritual adventure that is entirely captivating, and her friendship with Bashir Attar, the leader of the Musicians today, feels fated in some way. For fans of world music or of Robert Palmer and his legacy, this is ""must,"" but The Hand of Fatima also speaks volumes about family, genius and the deep and uncategorizable connections that lie beyond the mere science of DNA.",1322006400,2,1773,4.929765886287625
