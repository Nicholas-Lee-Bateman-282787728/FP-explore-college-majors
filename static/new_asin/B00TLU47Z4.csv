8702236,3,B00TLU47Z4,"Ukrainian band I MISS MY DEATH was formed back in 2007, and following a self released single, EP and mini-DVD they signed to Ukraine label Metal Scrap Records in 2014 who  subsequently released their debut album ""In Memories"" the same year. ""In Memories Presentation Show"" is their first proper DVD production, and was released through the same label in 2015.

For those aware of this band already, it might be noted that this DVD was actually recorded before their debut album was released, back in 2013, so one might assume that this DVD has been in development for quite some time. It does takes time to edit such a production properly, even if only three cameras was involved as in this case, and one might assume that the band wanted to know if there was a market for such a production before releasing it as well. Live DVDs is a product that will mainly be of interest for existing fans after all.

Musically this is a band that falls under the female fronted metal band umbrella. The main lead singer has a compelling, operatic voice, and her vocals are offset by a male vocalist who will alternately speak or growl. The band opts for a more regular heavy metal style in support, with occasional lapses into slower, doom-oriented passages and only on rare occasions taking a left turn into more pace-filled passages. The keyboards are central, in providing subtler details like a frail piano motif to add a tender quality to the proceedings but on most occasions as the provider of rich, symphonic motifs that combined with the guitars creates majestic soundscapes. I'd hazard a guess that some of the members in the band know their classical music fairly well too, in part due to the inclusion of the song Lacrimosa (credited to Mozart), but also due to the ballad Earl Pale, which comes across as just as much of a chamber music piece than a rock ballad in my book with piano, lead vocals and two violins combining in a compelling and suitably mournful composition.

The band performs the music rather well too, as far as I can judge. Elena Krivovyaz has good control of her voice, the instrumentalists all comes across as solid on their respective instruments, and while one might assume that there are some differences between this live performance and the studio album, that is the very nature of a live concert to begin with.

I didn't get much of a stage presence from the band however. Band chemistry and audience interaction are two of the dimensions that makes watching a live concert on DVD appealing, and these dimensions aren't brought too much into play here. Slightly aloof and introverted is the main impression I get, and as good a vocalist as Krivovyaz is she doesn't function as well as an engaging front person from what I can see. She is a good looking woman, and she has some fancy clothing on stage that is somewhat intriguing, but apart from that she doesn't have much of a distinct presence when not singing. As such the entertainment level of this DVD will, as I regard matters, be one more focused in towards existing fans and with less entertainment value for others.

The sound quality comes across as good, presumably captured directly from the soundboard. Well balanced and clear throughout, as one tends to expect from a band in the digital age. The video footage is more difficult to comment on, as I was sent this production as a digital promo. The color balance comes across as good, but the picture quality comes across as somewhat unfocused at times, slightly grainy, and in general perhaps not quite at the level one would expect of a recent live DVD. Still miles ahead of a budget production from the 1990's for instance, but not at the same level as the more professional live DVDs I'm accustomed to see from a label such as Metal Mind Productions.

As mentioned I regard live DVDs as products mainly of interest to existing fans. Some productions manage to appeal more broadly than that, but this one isn't one of those as I experience it at least. Those who are big time fans of what this band opts to describe as Gothic Doom Metal might want to track down the band's debut album and start their investigation at that point. Existing fans should find this DVD to be a pleasant one, and the closer your attachment to their music is, the higher this DVD should go on your shopping list.

My rating: 60/100",1455321600,,4352,4.657552083333333
