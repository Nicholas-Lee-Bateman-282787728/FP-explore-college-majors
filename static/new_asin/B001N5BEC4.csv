8598903,5,B001N5BEC4,"Lili and the Baobab was an interesting film which helped exemplify the connections between the modern western world and the African world.  A young French woman who takes it upon herself to help a poor African woman and a poor village.  It was an interesting case of how the ""white"" world could affect the daily goings on in the African world.  But it poses a question.  Should the white world intervene in the important aspects and cultural beliefs of the African world?  Should we have the right to interfere simply because we don't agree with something?  Lili and the Baobab explores these questions and presents them in a way that is easily understood by all.",1239062400,,663,4.721739130434782
8598904,5,B001N5BEC4,"LILI & THE BAOBAB takes us on a beautiful journey to Senegal where two women, one French, and one Senegalese, will become friends, allies and family for life. We feel we are Lili who leaves the cold shores of the French northern coast to stunningly sunny Senegal. We are thrown in a culture, landscape, lifestyle, and rythm that are so different from what we are accustomed to in the West. No one is judged in this film and no culture is superior to another. Women have an acute sense of solidarity beyond cultures, languages and political situations. A great bonus comes with this film: a 52mn making of with interviews of the crew and cast. Not to be missed by anyone who likes movies made with passion and small budgets (Romane Bohringer is the only professional actress in the film and Chantal Richard, the director, is one of the original founders of the twining between the village and the French city of Cherbourg).",1237075200,2,922,4.662576687116564
