8408108,5,B003XFN1XM,Trailer Park Boys are awesome! And the cost of this dvd made it even better! I am planning to collect them all!,1356825600,,111,4.090909090909091
8408109,5,B003XFN1XM,"The Trailer Park Boys series is fantastic.  All of the actors are spot on.  You really think you are in some messed up trailer park, and they are really filming a documentary.  The show has such great actors, and you fall in love with every character.",1338768000,2,251,4.413043478260869
8408110,3,B003XFN1XM,"The three star rating is only for this release of the show because of what it's lacking. The Trailer Park Boys is a great show. A fake documentary comedy similar to Reno 911. Unfortunately this release is done by a different company than all the other dvd seasons, specials, and movies out there. This dvd has absolutely no extras. You will be much better off buying the Season 1 & 2 TPBs which has lots of extras- commentary tracks, deleted scenes, alternate takes, interviews, outtakes and a music video.",1303257600,10,506,4.696629213483146
