1404400,4,B00005957N,"I had watched the Paris and France videos by Rick Steves and Globe Trekker before I took the trip there. I found this video very informative, covering various cultural aspects as well as places not mentioned in the other videos.

True, some portion of the video footage appears to be taken years ago, but the commentary is much better in depth than all the others. I wish I had this video before my trip. Highly recommend.",1111881600,21,422,4.552631578947368

Most information is still relevant, but I guarantee you can find a more enjoyable and up to date way of getting it. I recommend using resources like YouTube or your library for free info!!",1456963200,,330,4.338709677419355

7933137,5,B00005957N,"Loved this DVD because it gave soooo much information about traveling in France plus Frances' history and customs.
My wish is someone would do a DVD on being served the most wonderful meal in France..the whole DVD being served and consuming this meal. maybe they will enclosed a scratch and smell card to know the wonderful aromas of the food!! JUST  A WISH.",1368489600,,358,4.682539682539683
7933138,5,B00005957N,"What a wonderful surprise!  I looked for a DVD travel documentary that would give me a good understanding of the various places to go in France.  I stumbled across this one.  I was amazed at how well they presented the highlights of France: of Paris, the history, the nature areas, the food and wine, the castles and villages, the Alps, the folk dances, the art and culture...  The narrator told the story of France with great clarity and perfect Renaissance and Baroque music to match.  I now have an excellent understanding of France and I know exactly where I want to visit.  It opened a whole new and wonderful world.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1331251200,5,651,4.608695652173913
7933139,4,B00005957N,"You know, I read all of the previous comments and was reluctant to buy the DVD as a result.  However, there just aren't that many DVDs on France available at Amazon so I decided to take a chance any way.  Frankly, I'm glad I did.

I was specifically looking for a resource that highlighted each region of France and that's exactly what this DVD did.  So what if the clothing or hairstyles are a bit dated?  It is still a wonderful introduction to the country at large.

I'm a teacher and I developed a lesson plan for students to study the various regions of France on their own.  This DVD gives a great ""taste"" of each region without going into too much depth.  It's just enough to spark curiosity and research.  Do not be fooled by other reviews, I thought the DVD did exactly what I was looking for.

There are also extra video segments on the DVD that can be used as well.  Again, they are a bit dated, but again they cover the essential France.  I loved it!",1258156800,9,962,4.283333333333333
7933140,2,B00005957N,"When I viewed ""Video Visits: Discovering France,"" I wept, but not with nostalgic tears of joy. Rather, I was disappointed to see images of the France of yesteryear. The inclusion of the word ""video"" in the title should have been a clue.

More than a few scenes smacked of mid-'80s glitz and early-'90s bohemia. Yes, I loved the '80s, too.  Prince, Michael Jackson and Boy George were my demigods; Donna Summer, Madonna and Boy George my demigoddesses.  However, when I spend my hard-earned money on a travel DVD in anticipation of a forthcoming trip to France, I expect to view a contemporary perspective on a constantly evolving nation, including controversial issues.

It should come as no surprise, therefore, that I shuddered through a Paris fashion segment featuring early-'90s outfits.  Why stop with the '80s and '90s?  Why not reach back to '50s Paris and show Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir at Cafe Flore, decked out in their bourgeois-best duds while engrossed in an intense, caffeine-induced dialogue?

I was so annoyed with the ""Video Visits"" DVD, that I gave up on reminiscing my own trip to France and settled for fiction: the Hepburn-Astaire classic ""Funny Face.""  Now, in THAT film, I never mind watching the fabulous fashion parade of yore.

Thank heaven for the Travel Channel.",1167177600,7,1304,5.0
