8375836,5,B002O1EP1I,"Great episode! It is a 40 minute episode not a 20 minute one. It shows how dog, Tim and leland deal with their first case since they were arrested for the Andrew luster case. If you have seen the special on the arrest this follows on to his first case. Would definitely recommend it!",1483142400,,283,4.2592592592592595
