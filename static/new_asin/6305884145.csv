Thank you.",1147219200,,194,4.705882352941177
7898355,4,6305884145,"This is a really great video for people who want to learn the Tiger Crane form of Hung Gar Kung Fu. Master Chiu Chi Ling is one of the greats in the Hung Gar pantheon.

When I first saw this video, it did jar that it felt very much like a Hong Kong movie product. There is a beginning segment in which two guys are going at it that feels a movie like. However, the segment where gm Chiu Chi Ling does the entire form on the temple grounds is cool. Then, there are the whipping sound effects that at first sound jarring and theatrical, but when you get used to them, they actually help punctuate the individual techniques.  There is a good show of the emotional element of performing the techniques, but no explanation. The voice-over is in English. The form is broken up into ten sections.

What I think students already studying with a Hung Gar school will get from this, is a feel and sense of form that only a grandmaster like Chiu Chi Ling can convey, as well as a reminder of the sequence of techniques. The applications shown are ok, nothing great. There is also a ""self-defense"" section where Hung Gar students as assailants attack one by one, mainly using non-streetfighting techniques. However, all this can be forgiven, as this is a tape of a great Hung Gar master showing the style's signature form. Well recommended for any HG practitioner and any fan of martial arts history.",1032480000,7,1388,4.5
