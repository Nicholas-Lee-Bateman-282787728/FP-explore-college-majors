8687965,1,B00PHHGVOU,"Do not waste your money for the bonus ""DVD"". This bonus DVD asks a series of questions to determine which planes fire and rescue character you are and then reveals it after the series of questions. That's all the bonus DVD is. Not worth the extra money at all. No other quick clips are included on the bonus disc. If you really want this combo, Walmart sells this combo for the same price as purchasing only the movie on Amazon. $24.99",1419724800,3,435,4.382716049382716
