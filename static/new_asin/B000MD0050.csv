8209450,5,B000MD0050,Wow! These Cartoons brought back memories when I was a kid getting up at 6Am on Saturday mornings to get my cartoon fix. But The Selfish Giant and The Remarkable Rocket were on a Kid's TV show and I remember these ones real well. The VHS box is in excellent condition and I am impressed and pleased with the quality of the picture on the tape. It is real clean and clear.,1318809600,3,371,4.166666666666667
