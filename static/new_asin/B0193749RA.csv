8743771,5,B0193749RA,Well worth the puchase! Happy I own an all-region bluray player. Great film collection and fantastic World of Hammer complete collection.,1532131200,,137,5.571428571428571
8743772,5,B0193749RA,"I agree with the first review that if you can find this for a decent price it is MORE than worth it.  I paid I think 130 bucks for it two years ago and have gotten my money back many times over considering how many times I dip into it.  No, it doesn't have everything- and to the complainers that it's a Region B set, ok this one's not for you and it wasn't intended for you; It's an Australian release- but it's a great big doorstop of a package with lots of extras, at least 7 top-tier Hammer films, 5 good ones, and three middling efforts.  But let's face it, if you're a Hammer fan, in for a penny in for a pound.  It's an easy and less-expensive way at putting a dent in your need for all the Hammer that's out there. This, the WB box, the Universal box and a select few titles from Lionsgate (Dracula, Curse Of Frankenstein), Scream Factory (Vampire Lovers), Synapse (Twins Of Evil, Vampire Circus), and Studio Canal (Scars of Dracula, Dr Jekyll And Sister Hyde) and you've got a pretty thorough overview of Hammer.",1531699200,,1021,4.302083333333333
8743773,5,B0193749RA,"Shock Video from Australia has reissued it's HAMMER HORROR Blu-Ray Set. It now contains 17 Hammer Films on 15 Region-B/2 Blu-Rays and the Complete ""World Of Hammer"" TV Series on 2 PAL DVDs. The previous set only contained 13 discs, they have added the last four films listed below. All the Blu-Rays are available separately as Region-B/2 Blu-Ray+PAL DVD sets in Australia and as Slipcased Region-B/2 Blu-Ray+PAL DVD sets in the UK from StudioCanal (*), as Region B/2 Blu-Ray+PAL DVD sets from First Cut/Universal (**) and Hammer/Icon (***), and ""The Hound Of The Baskervilles"" which is available in the UK as a Region-B/2 Blu-Ray only release from Arrow Video (****).  There has also been a Limited Edition (of 3000) Region-A/1 release from Twilight Time of ""Hounds"" that has virtually the same extras. If these aren't enough to make you get up from your recliner and go out and buy a Region-Free Blu-Ray player, you never will.....!

The discs are within a VERY sturdy Book within a VERY sturdy Slipcase. Alas, the disc have to be slid in and out of slots, but if you invest in some of those Japanese ""rice paper"" sleeves they fit just fine and protect the discs. The only major problem in this set (and with the stand-alone StudioCanal release) is the soundtrack to ""Rasputin The Mad Monk"" on the Blu-Ray. Someone screwed up while authoring and transferred it in 1.0 Dolby Digital instead of Lossless LPCM as the rest. It's listenable but VERY ""tinny."" The DVD sounds fine.  Supposedly the StudioCanal release has been corrected and the stand alone Shock version is OK. MOST of the Shock releases cart over the extras found on the StudioCanal, First Cut, Hammer/Icon and Arrow discs except for the following:

- StudioCanal's QUATERMASS AND THE PIT also has the alternate US credits and trailer
- StudioCanal's RASPUTIN: THE MAD MONK also has an alternate 2:55:1 version of the film, THE WORLD OF HAMMER episode ""Costumes"" (on DVD 2 of this set), a Commentary Track featuring Christopher Lee, Barbara Shelley, Francis Matthews and Suzan Farmer, and a Photo Gallery.
- StudioCanal's THE DEVIL RIDES OUT also has  a Stills Gallery, a Commentary featuring Christopher Lee, Sarah Lawson & Marcus Hearn, and an Easter Egg. The World of Hammer Episode 'Hammer' is on DVD 2.
- The Hammer/Icon FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL also contains a 1:37 version in HD, and a Commentary Track
- StudioCanal's THE WITCHES has a Commentary Track, the featurette ""Hammer Glamour"" is on the ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" disc
- Arrow's THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES also features Optional English subtitles, a new audio Commentary with Hammer experts Marcus Hearn and Jonathan Rigby, a new interview with hound mask creator Margaret Robinson, a new interview with assistant director Hugh Harlow, ""The Many Faces of Sherlock Holmes"" a 1986 documentary looking at the many incarnations of Conan Doyle s celebrated character, narrated and presented by Christopher Lee, ""Actor s Notebook: Christopher Lee"" an archive interview in the which the actor recalls his experiences of making THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, ""The Hounds of the Baskervilles"" Excerpts read by Christopher Lee, the original Theatrical Trailer, a Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Paul Shipper and a Collector s booklet featuring new writing on the film by Hammer archivist Robert J.E. Simpson, illustrated with original archive stills and posters
- First Cut/Universal's THE BRIDES OF DRACULA also features ""The Making of The Brides of Dracula"" Narrated by Edward de Souza and featuring interviews with Yvonne Monlaur, Jimmy Sangster, Hugh Harlow, Pauline Harlow, Don Mingaye, Margaret Robinson and Tony Hinds, and a Stills Gallery
- First Cut/Universal's THE CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF also featues ""The Making of Curse of the Werewolf"" documentary with interviews with Catherine Feller, Yvonne Romain, Mike Hill, Don Mingaye, Margaret Robinson Jimmy Sangster,"" ""Lycanthropy: The Beast in All of Us"" documentary, a Stills Gallery and ""Censoring the Werewolf"" A new 13-minute documentary directed by Hammer Films historian Marcus Hearn.

Unless your a rabid ""have to have it all fan"" or still in the DVD era, you can't go wrong with this set from Shock, which can be found for $150 US or less if you shop around. I actual paid $107 US for mine.....

8743774,5,B0193749RA,Love Hammer films!,1470700800,,18,5.333333333333333
8743775,5,B0193749RA,"Previous reviewers seem unaware of some basic realities about the world economy and media products.  This is an Australia/New Zealand product that was not produced for the US market, but it is nice that some sellers have made it available to other countries like the US.

The US rights for most of the well-known vintage Hammer films belong to different companies.  They decide when and how to release those films.  Hammer does not make those decisions and the EU has nothing to do with that.  There is good news for people that are not world citizens and will not make the minimal investment in a multi-region (A,B,C) multi-format (PAL/NTSC) Blu Ray player: there are some Region A Blu Ray releases available and more are on the way - including what looks like a nice 8 disc Blu Ray upgrade of the 8 disc DVD version of Universal's Hammer Horror Series set available here on Amazon.  That is the follow up to Warner's release last year of the 4 disc Blu Ray set Hammer Horror Collection, Volume One.  It's great that they are releasing these since the market for them is minuscule in relation to the Blu Ray market for recent blockbusters.

I own the prior 13 disc version of this set which is also mostly Region B (Blu Ray discs have had region encoding since their inception).  This 17 disc set adds 4 films: Hounds of the Baskervilles, Captain Kronos, Brides of Dracula, and Curse of the Werewolf.  The original set plays nicely and was a good addition to my Hammer collection.  Note that only the film discs on these sets are Blu Ray; some additional content such as ""The World of Hammer"" is on DVDs. Also note that the discs are in PAL format.

So, as ever, the choices for world film enthusiasts remain the same: get a mult-region player, buy digital versions from sellers like Amazon Video or iTunes or Vudu (not all titles are available but there are quite a few Hammer films in digital versions), or wait and hope for releases that match your hardware's capabilities.  The films presented on the reviewed product are well-known and IMHO worth owning and viewing in whatever way possible.

I give this product 5 stars based on what it is: a great set of Blu Ray versions of vintage Hammer films in a licensed release for Region B-capable Blu Ray players.",1467849600,12,2263,4.610972568578553
8743776,1,B0193749RA,I agree with the previous reviewer Hammer Films needs to wake-up and realize America love The Hammer Genre. I thought Blu Ray discs were compatible with any blu ray player?This is the kind of bad decisions on Hammers Part that send the company into a downward spiral that bankrupted them in the first place.,1467763200,9,307,4.703703703703703
8743777,1,B0193749RA,"I still do not understand how Hammer Films makes money by denying widespread American audiences the opportunity to purchase these films on Blu Ray. It just makes no sense. Does Hammer own stock in region free player companies? Now that the UK has exited the EU, maybe these Hammer execs will be smarter and go after American customers who love these films. Who knows?",1466812800,13,367,4.75
