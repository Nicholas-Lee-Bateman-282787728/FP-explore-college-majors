The only problem I had with the whole show was the camera work(angles)/quality. I know this event took place in 2005 but ROH had better quality at the time. Anyway, I thought this was a good DVD and I've decided to keep it to watch again and again in the near future. I might just have to buy more FIP Wrestling DVDs soon.",1504915200,,437,3.977272727272727
