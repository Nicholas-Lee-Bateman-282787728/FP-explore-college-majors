2099892,5,B0002JZT5U,I've only watched the first 7 episodes but I am already so glad I bought this.  It's reasonbly priced and has great entertainment value.  I was born in 77 so I was too young for tv during the first couple of seasons but watched the later years and loved it.  This is a must have for any child of the 80's.,1096243200,8,305,3.9672131147540983
2099893,5,B0002JZT5U,"One of the older series I have been most anticipating on DVD is Diff'rent Strokes.  Outside of a brief stint on Nick At Nite in early 2001, DS has been pretty hard to locate on television for the past 8 or 9 years.

This show is bashed a lot by people who weren't there, but for those of us who were kids when this show was big, there are a lot of memories here.

Of course, the star of the show is Gary Coleman.  Say what you will about him and his post-DS ""career"",  but Arnold Jackson Drummond was an icon.  How anyone can deny his comedy talent is beyond me.  He was hysterical and had the comedic timing that people three times his age wished they had.  I think this show could've been named ""Arnold"" since that is what the show is.

The first season sees Charlotte Rae playing Mrs. Garrett, a role that went onto The Facts Of Life (I hope this comes out soon too on DVD),  she was hilarious.  Dana Plato (RIP) and Todd Bridges also were quickly getting settled into their roles.  Both of them had awful post-DS lives,  but let's just see them as they were on the show and not dwell on their future failures.

This is a DVD pretty much anyone between 24-35 should have... it is a part of our childhood and it is STILL just as funny now as it was a quarter of a century ago.

Columbia, bring on season 2!",1095206400,7,1308,4.134920634920635
2099894,5,B0002JZT5U,THIS WAS A GREAT T.V. SHOW AND I REALLY DID ENJOY IT I USED TO COME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND WATCH THIS SHOW EVERYDAY. I REMEMBER WHEN IT USED TO COME ON NBC. IT IS A SHAME HOW THE QUALITY OF TELEVISION AND RADIO IS SO BAD AND IS IN SUCH POOR TASTE THAT THE DEMAND OF CLASSIC TELEVISION IS IN DEMAND.  THIS WAS A GREAT SHOW AND I REALLY DID ENJOY THE SHOW. I THOUGHT GARY WAS SO DARLING AND CUTE. AND TODD WAS ALWAYS A GREAT KID ACTOR. DANA PLATO DID A FINE JOB AS WELL.  CHARLOTTE RAE DID A FINE JOB ALSO.  THIS IS A  FUN HEARTWARMING SHOW AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS FAMILY FUN I REMEMBER WHEN GARY (ARNOLD ) HAD A GOLDFISH NAMED ABRAHAM . I  REALLY DID ENJOY THIS SHOW AND I WOULD RECCOMEND ANYONE WHO ENJOYED THIS SHOW IN THE PAST TO PURCHASE THIS DVD.,1094083200,3,770,3.91025641025641
2099895,5,B0002JZT5U,"I am so happy this show is finally getting the DVD treatment! I absolutely LOVED this show when I was a kid and Arnold had a heart of gold.

Too bad that show that gave us so many laughs would end in tragedy for the castmembers, but hey that laughs had to continue in some form or another. From Gary Coleman beating some woman up to Willis high on crack and shooting a guy to Kimberly robbing a video store and then OD'ing, one has to wonder just what kind of father Mr. Drummond really was!",1092873600,3,491,4.114583333333333

2099897,5,B0002JZT5U,"This is a great show. I watched this show to death in reruns. I also got the Columbia House collector tapes. I also have some episodes on DVD RAM that I recorded off of Nick. The problem with Nick and TV Land is all the reruns are edited. One scene that is cut from the pilot is Miss Garet telling Mr. Drummond to have a garage sale,Mr. Drummond replied ""What's a garage sale?"" That scene was not on the Nick version. At long last a full season of Diffrent Strokes is coming to DVD uncut. Way to go Sony Pictures!
Update-Sorry The Garrage sale comment Miss Garet made to Mr. Drummond was in the second  episode ""The Social Worker"" Not the pilot. My mistake!",1090800000,8,657,4.298387096774194
2099898,3,B0002JZT5U,"When this series debuted (1978) on the NBC network, interracial families and/or single parent families were still a cultural annomally.

Harlem residents Arnold and Willis come to live with the white Phillip Drummond (Conraid Bain), after their mother dies from a generic fatal illness. On her death bed, she makes her employer promise that the boys will be taken care of in her absence. Instead of being annoyed by the new responsibilities and ensuing mishaps, Mr. Drummond is genuinely happy to treat the boys as one of his own. Subsequently, there is an endless stream of gags about the family and their cosmetic legitimacy in relation to the larger society. Are they actually a family, or is it a practial joke several families decided to put together?
Another notable character is Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae) the Drumond's new housekeeper. Although she would quickly be spun off into the far more successfull The Facts of Life as dorm mother of Kimberly's (the late Dana Plato) elite boarding school, she provides the 'maternal influence' to this comedy ensemble. This critical transition occurs towards the end of the season, and although it does not do anything for the series itself---was very important for network ratings.
With the status of it's many associated child stars subsequently diminishing, this show has taken a beating in American pop culture. Since the first season is not half that bad, it is rather disappointing that the crude jokes abound.",1089331200,5,1467,5.087136929460581

2099949,5,B0002JZT5U,"""Diff'rent Strokes"" is a sitcom that broke new ground, as it was the first to feature a premise of two young boys from Harlem being adopted by a wealthy financier - actually, a construction magnate. The sitcom's main subjects, Willis & Arnold Jackson, find it rather a challenge to acquiesce to their new environment. Along the way, they learn how to see what it's like living on the other side of the fence, as well as facing issues such as fitting in socially & tackling dating & various forms of peer pressure. It's a delight to see Willis & Arnold enjoying their new surroundings. Big sister Kimberly is there to help her newly-adoptive brothers along on their journey. Along with the precocious young cast of Gary Coleman, Todd Bridges & Dana Plato, Charlotte Rae plays mother hen to all three as Edna Garrett. Philip Drummond (Conrad Bain) is quite the father to all three of his children, as he's always there to see Willis, Arnold & Kimberly through good & bad times. Not only does this sitcom deal with important subjects as dating & social groups, it tackles the subject of discrimination & bias head-on, as we see in an episode where Willis & Arnold are rejected admission into an exclusive private school - Mr. Drummond's alma mater. A sitcom is only as good as the writers, producers & actors can make it, & ""Diff'rent Strokes"" fits the bill as all three of these items are concerned. The first two seasons are worthy of many a viewing, so pick up ""Diff'rent Strokes - The Complete First Season"" ASAP!

2099960,4,B0002JZT5U,"DIFFERENT STROKES was an American TV sitcom that aired on NBC from Friday November 3, 1978 to Saturday May 4, 1985 and then on ABC from Friday September 27, 1985 thru Friday March 7, 1986 and was an instant smash when it made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1978.

DIFFERENT STROKES was a sitcom regarding 2 African American boys named Arnold Jackson(Gary Coleman) and Willis Jackson(Todd Bridges)from Harlem who are adopted by a wealthy white Park Avenue businessman Philip Drummond(Conrad Bain)and his daughter Kimberly(Dana Plato)for whom their deceased mother used to work for and all lived in a penthouse in New York City.

Additionally; Arnold often addressed his famous line ""Whatcha Talkin' 'Bout"" just like Higgins on MAGNUM, PI became known for his often addressed line ""Oh My God"".

In this 1978-79 Season; Charlotte Rae co-starred as the Drummond's maid(Mrs. Edna Garrett)whom ultimately departed DIFFERENT STROKES in the Spring of 1979 to star in the spin-off series THE FACTS OF LIFE which debuted on NBC in the Fall of 1979.

Therefore when Mrs. Garrett left DIFFERENT STROKES, she was replaced by Nedra Volz as the housekeeper Adelaide Brubaker in this shows 2nd Season whom was later replaced by housekeeper Pearl Gallagher(Mary Jo Catlett)in the 5th Season and remained on the show for the last 4 seasons until the show was axed in March of 1986.

DIFFERENT STROKES made stars out of child actors Todd Bridges and the late Gary Coleman and the late Dana Plato and the show became known for very ""special episodes"" regarding serious issues like racism, illegal drug abuse, and child sexual abuse were dramatically explored throughout DIFFERENT STROKES whole 8-year run.

Unfortunately, in reality the lives of Coleman, Bridges, and Plato were later plagued by legal troubles and drug addiction as their stardom and success they all acheived while doing DIFFERENT STROKES eluded them after the series was cancelled in the Spring of 1986.

As a matter of fact; Dana Plato was fired from the show in the Spring of 1984 for substance abuse, especially after being publicised with brushes of it.

Therefore Plato's character of Kimberly Drummond was bounced from the show and was written out the story lines in the 7th Season with the explanation that Kimberly moved away to Paris to study abroad for a couple of years.

Meanwhile; the ratings started to sag in the 6th Season, so new characters were added to open up future storylines
in the 7th Season as viewers now getting to see Philip as happily married now.

Therefore the addition of Dixie Carter as divorced TV aerobics instructor(Maggie McKinney)and Danny Cooksey as Maggie's son(Sam McKinney)were added to the show as permanent co-stars after joining the cast in the Winter of 1984 midway through DIFFERENT STROKES 1983-84 Season when Philip eventually married Maggie after Philip and his family fly all the way out to L.A. in a 2-part trip episode in February of 1984 when Philip proposes to her.

Unfortunately, since the addition of Maggie and Sam did nothing to improve the ratings, NBC had cancelled DIFFERENT STROKES in the Spring of 1985 and Carter departed the series at the end of its 1984-85 Season and ABC picked up from the series trying to revive it for an 8th Season airing it on Friday nights which turned out to be the last season of the show and Dixie Carter was replaced by Mary-Ann Mobley as Maggie McKinney as Carter had left the show to co-star on DESIGNING WOMEN, but it just so happens that Mobley had previously guest starred as an unrelated one-off love interest of Philip's in an episode of DIFFERENT STROKES 1st Season.

Unfortunately, ABC had cancelled the series after only 19 episodes and aired its final episode in March of 1986 since the ratings flopped even more when DIFFERENT STROKES was moved from NBC to ABC since this shows 1985-86 Season only ranked 76th out of 106 shows and only averaged an 11.5 household rating.",1344902400,,3927,4.906485671191554

2099963,5,B0002JZT5U,I love watching this.  This is a nice addition to my sitcom collections!  It takes me back to the olden days with laughs and smiles,1315872000,,131,4.2
2099964,5,B0002JZT5U,"What do you get when you combine superb comedic timing, charm, charisma and that 'special something' one is either born with or not, but no one can give you?  Gary Coleman.  I must confess that when I sat down to watch Diff'rent Strokes, after not having seen the show for over 20+ years, I did not expect it to have stood the passage of time. Other shows, such as Laverne & Shirley, while clever, nostalgic and funny, fail to do so as well as this series.  I originally rented the DVD's, but after I watched a couple of shows, I flat out bought it! It was even better than the first time!

After I watched the first episode of Diff'rent Strokes, I was hooked.  The writing was excellent and the acting, particularly Coleman, Bridges and Rae's, superb.  I must admit that it got a little hard watching Dana Plato looking at one of the cameras every so often, but eventually she got the hang of it.  If you think that an entire episode - about 30 pages of script, give or take - usually rested on Coleman (barely 10 years old) and Bridges' shoulders, the show is even more awe inspiring.  I just could not wait to watch more of Coleman's charm and humor delivery with every episode.  Indeed, we lost an incredible talent with his passing.  The cast's great chemistry is also truly palpable and it is easy to believe these people truly liked each other.

On another note, I wonder if a show like this would make it today, considering the incredible amount of political correctness on TV these days, plus the high racial tension (on both sides) we're experiencing.  What I am treasuring about this show is the raw honesty and tact with which racism is handled.  Because of it, I think it can make anyone color blind.  In fact, I wish this show would be on right now...we need it!

If there is only one thing more astounding than Coleman's talent here it is that SONY would follow it's usual MO and pull the plug on further DVD releases of Diff'rent Strokes, as it seems to do with a high percentage of its TV of DVD releases.  This show is truly superb and deserves to see a full release.  One would hope that eventually SONY would get their act together, stop using the consumer as a guinea pig and show a little more respect.  This said, do not let SONY's moronic behavior deter you and get the two available seasons.  It is truly a magnificent experience.

UPDATE:  'Shout! Factory' has picked up this series and is scheduling the release for the rest of the seasons!  Shout! is known, thankfully, for making up for SONY's lack of consumer awareness.",1301270400,,2550,4.474025974025974

2099971,5,B0002JZT5U,"""Diff'rent Strokes"" was one of my favorite TV shows from my childhood. Here was a comedy show that I would constantly watch with my friends and family members. And why not? It was a sitcom that the whole family could enjoy. Not to mention it was a very funny show. So I decided to take a little trip down memory lane and watch the entire first season of ""Diff'rent Strokes"" on DVD, and it still holds up well 30 years after it debuted on NBC.

The premise: wealthy widower Philip Drummond agrees to honor the dying wish of his black housekeeper (a widow) and take care of her two sons Arnold and Willis Jackson. He brings the two boys from Harlem to live in his luxurious penthouse apartment with him, his daughter Kimberly, and their new housekeeper Mrs. Garrett. What follows during the course of season one is the wonderful bond that this family creates. In the very first episode, older boy Willis (13 years old) is not too pleased to be living away from Harlem. But as the first season progresses, he and his younger brother Arnold (8 years old) begin to really like living with their new family.

There are many touching moments throughout the first season of ""Diff'rent Strokes"" as well as a lot of funny moments. There are many episodes that I liked, but my personal favorites were: Episode #5 - ""The Spanking"", where Arnold gets in trouble for dropping water bombs off the 30th floor balcony and Mr. Drummond thinks that a spanking is the best form of punishment; Episode #12 - ""The Woman"", in which Arnold, Willis, and Kimberly try to ruin Mr. Drummond's plans to propose to his new girlfriend who isn't quite the nice lady they though she was; Episode #22 - ""Getting Involved"", which puts Arnold in a tight spot after witnessing a robbery and becoming the prime target of the robber; and Episode #23 - ""Willis's Birthday"", where the entire clan go to Harlem to celebrate Willis's 14th birthday. But all-in-all, there was rarely a disappointing moment during the first season of ""Diff'rent Strokes"".

The cast of ""Diff'rent Strokes"" was a very good one. Conrad Bain, who had just come off of six years on the hit Bea Arthur series ""Maude"" (where he was hilarious as Dr. Arthur Harmon), was wonderful as Philip Drummond. Here's a very good actor who starred on back-to-back hit sitcoms, then seemed to disappear from the scene after ""Diff'rent Strokes"" was cancelled in 1986 after eight years on the tube. The only acting projects that I saw Bain in after ""Diff'rent Strokes"" ended its run was a supporting role in the short-lived George C. Scott 1987-1988 sitcom ""Mr. President"" (which aired on the Fox network back when it was a brand new network airing opposite network heavyweights CBS, NBC, and ABC), and a very small role as Meryl Streep's grandfather in the 1990 Mike Nichols film ""Postcards from the Edge"". But since then I haven't seen him in anything else. As good as Bain was, he wasn't the main star of ""Diff'rent Strokes"". That honor belonged to Gary Coleman, who played the wisecracking Arnold. Here was an actor who went on the steal scene after scene and in the process got the biggest laughs on the show. He also provided the show's now famous catchphrase: ""Whatchoo talkin' bout?"" All of that is evident in season one. But lets not forget about the other actors: Todd Bridges and the late Dana Plato were also very good as Willis and Kimberly. And Charlotte Rae was terrific as Mrs. Garrett. Rae would move on to her own show, which was the ""Diff'rent Strokes"" spin-off ""The Facts of Life"". You can see the ""Diff'rent Stokes""/""Facts of Life"" connection with the final episode of season one titled ""The Girls' School"" (featuring a guest appearence by a very young Molly Ringwald, who went on to star in the first season of ""The Facts of Life""). Just like ""Diff'rent Strokes"", ""The Facts of Life"" went on the become a big hit as well. The later seasons of ""Diff'rent Strokes"" would feature two different housekeepers, but I always thought Mrs. Garrett was the best housekeeper on this show. And Rae made the most out of that role (she was great on ""The Facts of Life"" as well).

It was well worth it watching the first season of ""Diff'rent Strokes"". This is a great show to watch along with anybody. Whether your an adult or a kid and you're looking for a very funny family sitcom from the past to watch on DVD, ""Diff'rent Strokes"" would be a great choice. Plus the DVD feature a couple of great extras, which include a look back at the show and has interviews with three of the actors: Conrad Bain, Todd Bridges, and Charlotte Rae (as well as some of the crew members behind the show). Unfortunately, Gary Coleman is noticeably absent from the extras. It would have been great to see him in the DVD extras.",1215907200,,4732,4.629761904761905

2099975,5,B0002JZT5U,"With all of the problems that the three child stars of Diff'rent Strokes faced, people often forget what a talented cast the show had, especially that of 10-year-old Gary Coleman.  Anyone who has forgotten can now easily go back and reminice with this first season boxed set.

What made Gary Coleman, as Arnold Jackson, an overnight sensation was his sense of comedic timing.  In fact, I put him up there with Cary Grant and Michael J. Fox as far as comedic timing goes, and Gary Coleman was a kid!  I grew up with Diff'rent Strokes, so as a child, I couldn't appreciate the acting abilities of Gary, but now as an adult, I can truly marvel at the level of talent that this young kid had, especially for a young kid who was plagued with kidney problems throughout his childhood.

Comedic timing wasn't his only ability.  Just watch his broad range of facial expressions that he used.  And, of course, his signature line that he will forever be remembered for, ""Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis?""  VH1 has him ranked as the #1 greatest child star, and deservedly so.  Gary was the heart and soul of the show.  This was a kid who was overflowing with joy and affection, and he often demonstrated this in his character.

The rest of the cast was great as well in the first season.  Todd Bridges, already a veteran child actor in such roles as in Little House on the Prairie, plays Willis.  Todd and Gary worked well off one another, and it showed.  Willis Jackson has pride, and it's this pride that often gets him into trouble.  Arnold has to talk Willis out of leaving Mr. Drummond in the pilot episode.

Dana Plato didn't really solidify her role until subsequent seasons that followed.  You'll notice that she isn't in the first season a whole lot.  I think producers were initially unsure of whether or not she would be a permanent character.  Rumors had it that she was going to be part of the ""Facts of Life"" cast.  You see more of her character in season 2 as Kimberly.

Who can forget Diff'rent Strokes' first and best housekeeper, Edna Garrett played with true charm by Charlotte Rae.  Obviously the producers quickly saw her great acting ability and quickly figured that she should have her own show.

Conrad Bain, a veteran of such sitcoms as Maude, was a brilliant choice to play Philip Drummond, the guardian of Arnold and Willis.  While he certainly has comedic talent, he wonderfully balances it with wisdom and discipline.  Mr. Drummond usually butts heads the most with Willis.

You have to remember the time that this show was running.  It was quite a new idea to have two African-American boys going to live with Caucasian man.  Many of the episodes in the first couple of seasons had the boys and Mr. Drummond dealing with prejudicial people and their views.  A social worker who visits states that, ""black children belong with black families.""  The social worker quickly finds out that it's love that counts, not the color of your skin, and this is the point that the show drove home each week.

I'd been waiting for this show to come to DVD for some time now.  I still enjoy watching this show as well as watching and appreciating the comedic genius of Gary Coleman.  On this show, he truly was a joy to watch.",1197763200,,3228,4.5971978984238175
2099976,1,B0002JZT5U,"I thought the languages that had this DVD on the description saying English and Spanish, when it DOES NOT come in Spanish, :( thats a lie thats why i bought it but anyways iamnot really happy with this Item.",1190678400,7,207,4.333333333333333
2099977,3,B0002JZT5U,"It's hard to judge a show like Diff'rent Strokes, since the show itself has fallen into footnote to the tabloid fiascos that became the lives of the three child stars.  With that in mind, I tried to seperate myself from that and focus on the show qualities itself.  And, it was alright.

Conrad Bain plays Phil Drummond, a wealthy man on Park Avenue in New York City who promised his long time housekeeper on her deathbed that he would adopt and care for her two children.  And, true to his word, he adopts two black boys to live with him and his daughter.  The show's producers said that sometimes if you tell a big enough lie the people will believe it.  And, I would have to agree with this.  They were getting hate mail from the Klu Klux Klan over this.  And yet, this became a cultural phenomenon.

Why it became a cultural phenomenon is hard for me to see past the obvious cuteness of Gary Coleman and that ""Whatchoo talkin' bout?"" line.  The show in the beginning was not that outrageous save for the fact there are two black children living with a white man as their father without a mother figure (save for Mrs. Garrett the housekeeper).  Eventually the show would evolve into more semi sleazy topics (child porn, drugs, etc.); but, the only issue they dealt with in the very beginning was, obviously, racism.  Some of it was a little too over the top - Arnold and Willis being harassed by superiors or authority figures before they realized that Mr. Drummond really was their adopted father, transistor radios and dancing to the beat, etc.  Are we better people because of this?  I don't know.  Did we learn lessons from this show?  Maybe a few.  With that, it was an educational show that tried to appeal to the kiddie / tween set to engrain positive messages.

But, I can't get past the kids on the show and how their lives have fallen apart.  Todd Bridges (Willis) succombed to drugs and a vareity of brushes with the law, even a murder charge.  Gary Coleman (Arnold) sued his parents for their loss of his fortunes, lost his family, and had a few legal troubles as well.  And Dana Plato.  Just about anything and everything that could and would go wrong did.  Teenage motherhood, drugs, armed robbery, porn movies, poverty, and eventually, her death.  And, truth be told, while we often talk about the plight of a child star and how they tend to ruin their lives as adults, they were good actors.  They were not great, however.  They were good.  They were not great, they were good.  While some child actors have risen above the stigma of child star (Ron Howard, Jodie Foster, Brooke Shields, etc.), these three were examples of inertia who didn't expand into other fields and felt they were gyped by the establishment.  Sorry, not buying it.  They were some of the first Hollywood Brats Gone Bad.  The greats will stay.  They did not.",1182988800,4,2849,4.558185404339251

2099985,5,B0002JZT5U,".. the cosmos align and a show comes along that touches the very soul of a nation. DS was not that show, but it came remarkably close to being something special.

Virtually ignored by the Oscar voters, DS had a cast that oozed with charm, talent and just a slight bit of desperation. For Conrad Bain, it was his last grasp at a hit TV show after years of playing second fiddle and character actors and dealing with substance abuse. For Dana Plato it was a way out of her unhappy home in Maywood, California and a chance to meet Conrad Bain. For Todd Bridges, who had only a few more years of rascal-like cuteness before adolesence was to hit him in bad way. For Charlotte Rae, DS was one last gasp at acting before returning to the promise she made to her father to take over his veterinary practice in Milwaukee. And for Gary Coleman, sweet adorable Gary Coleman. Huggable to the ""nth"" degree, Gary was a superstar, photo shoots, jet setting and break dancing his way through his young years. It was Gary's only chance to break away from his controlling parents in Zion, Illinois. Parents who would criticize his every move ... and felt he wore plaid pants too often to be taken seriously.

This show touched the heavens and left us all with a smile on our face. I particulary enjoyed Dudley's dad. Man, that was one sharp-looking man. Why wasn't he on more?",1147132800,5,1359,4.475806451612903
2099986,5,B0002JZT5U,"This series is really dated now, but I have to admit for its day it was ground breaking and very different.

Growing myself a child born to a racially mixed family whose teenage years were the end of the 1970s, early 1980s I have to admit ""Different Strokes"" made me feel good about myself, okay so Willis and Arnold were Black and living with a white man and his daughter but such diversity that was close to my own background was not something that was portrayed on TV all that often, so this was a breath of fresh air and my siblings and I were great fans from the word go.

We loved the antics of Arnold and his catchphrase, ""Whatcha talking about Willis?"" along with the sparing relationship between Willis, Arnold and their white step-sister Kimberley who was more prominent in the second series, in this series she was often away at boarding school.

Conrad Bain was the great as Arnold and Willis' long suffering step-father Phillip Drummond, and Dana Plato was wonderful as the brace-teethed Kimberly who was delighted to have two new brothers and cheerfully told them in the first episode, ""touch my bedroom and you're dead!"" Spoken like a true sibling.

The series was ground breaking not only for its mixed race cast but also for the subjects it attempted to tackle, such as racism, intolerance etc which it did with humour and a candidness that was amazing for its day, even now in the 21st century we are struggling to face our demons when it comes to subjects we are not comfortable with.

A great series, that brings back some real good memories, don't expect too much in the way of state of the art sets and such like, however the acting is pretty good, the humour still funny enough to give you a belly laugh every now and then but it is dated but then what series isn't?

I haven't seen the series since it was on Nick at Nite & TV Land, a few years ago. It's unfortunate that it is no longer on TV. But I was very glad to pick up this DVD set of the first season. It includes twenty-four, full and uncut episodes (more than most sitcoms) from the 1978 - 1979 season.

Here's all the episodes included in this set with the original air dates:

Movin' In (November 3, 1978)
Millionaire Philip Drummond ('Maude' star Conrad Bain) welcomes 8-year-old Arnold Jackson (Gary Coleman) and his 13-year-old brother Willis (Todd Bridges) into his New York penthouse. Mr. Drummond tries to make his new sons feel at home with the help of his daughter, Kimberly (played by the late Dana Plato) and his housekeeper (future 'Facts Of Life' star Charlotte Rae) Mrs. Garrett. Arnold also utters his trademark catch-phrase, ""whatchya talkin' about Willis"" for the first time in this episode.

The Social Worker (November 10, 1978)
Arnold's big ears cause him to misinterpret Drummond's conversation with Mrs. Garrett. And, Arnold convinces Willis that Mr. Drummond doesn't want them around. It's all cleared up though when their new family comes to pick them up.

Mother's Last Visit (November 17, 1978)
The title of this episode should be 'Mother's Only Visit' because this is the only time Mr. Drummond's busybody mother makes an appearance. When Grandma Drummond finds out about her two adopted grandsons she faints in front of them prompting the boys to tell Drummond that she isn't happy to have them around.

Prep School (November 24, 1978)
When Mr. Drummond tries to get Arnold and Willis into his former prep school it turns out to be a valuable lesson in bigotry.

The Spanking (December 1, 1978)

The Trial (December 15, 1978)
Willis sets up Arnold to take the rap so that he can prove to Drummond that fair trials are hard to come by. This episode is a total 'Brady Bunch' rip-off, but in my opinion 'Diff'rent Strokes' got it better because it was funnier and more believable.

Retrospective (1) (December 29, 1978)
This is a flashback episode with the boys and Mr. Drummond and Kimberly and Mrs. Garrett. The opening credits for this episode are different, it shows Arnold and Willis' bedroom with the 'Diff'rent Strokes' logo and the theme song is shorter. Originally aired as a one hour episode.

This is second half of the retrospective episode. The opening credits for this episode are the standard opening credits.

The Fight (January 5, 1979)

The Club Meeting (January 12, 1979)
Willis invites his friends from his former neighborhood over to show off.

The Woman (January 19, 1979)

This is the original pilot of what was to become 'The Facts Of Life.' Mrs. Garrett visits Kimberly's school (East Lake, in 'The Facts Of Life' called East Land) and has a run-in with the school's pushy principal. Also introduced are future 'The Facts Of Life' costars: Nancy, Sue Ann, Tootie, and stuck-up Blair.

I can't wait for Season Two of 'Diff'rent Strokes' to be released on DVD. I also can't wait for 'The Facts Of Life' to make its DVD debut! Both are classic sitcoms that are greatly missed.",1112486400,91,6349,4.795600366636114
2099996,5,B0002JZT5U,Can't say enough about this show. The editing and sound are wonderful and of course the show is a classic. It is just as funny as you remember it! I thought that I would enjoy it's nostalgic essence and grin at the slapstick humor but I and my wife (she never really watched the show when it aired originally) couldn't help but laugh at Arnold over and over. Great show! Highly recommended!,1109894400,3,390,4.430555555555555
2099997,5,B0002JZT5U,"Here is one of the greatest TV shows of all time on DVD.  With Gary Coleman and sexy Dana Plato, how can one go wrong?  I can't believe that only one season of this is currently available.  It makes me also want to get Facts of Life on DVD, which has not been released yet.  There is great ""What choo talkin' bout""? comedy and lessons on life in this series.  Unlike many family sitcoms, this one involves a rich family.  Therefore, it is closer to ""The Cosby Show"" than ""Good Times.""  Just about everything Gary Coleman says is funny.  Dana Plato is just too much to handle.  I always had a crush on her.  I highly recommend this set and look forward to more seasons being released.",1108857600,2,683,4.307086614173229

2099999,4,B0002JZT5U,"I always thought that catchphrase was a little wordy.

I want to start a Diff'rent Strokes drinking game where you drink every time Willis wakes Arnold up in the middle of the night and says, ""c'mon, Arnold.  We don't belong here.""

Also drink for every ""special episode"" they have, like when Sam was abducted, or when Kimberly and Arnold were abducted, or when Mr. Carlson tried to molest them (and they weren't abducted).

Hilarious sitcom hijinks!",1098230400,3,450,4.881578947368421
