4270175,5,B0046MOVD0,"When it comes to movies, there are general expectations that everyone can rely upon:  Having big name stars does not guarantee quality, anything James Cameron makes will earn more money then the total income of many third world countries, and movies based on video games are awful.  Yet, surprisingly, Resident Evil:  Afterlife breaks the trend by being a movie based on a video game that isn't just decent...it's actually really fun.

Resident Evil:  Afterlife, follows Alice, genetically modified super heroine, who for the past three films have been battling zombies, undead monsters, and generally making the film's universe revolve around her.  This film sees her continuing her quest to fight the evil Umbrella Corporation and save the world (or what's left of it) from a zombie apocalypse that has wiped out over 99% of humanity, by means of guns, kung fu, and whatever weapons she can improvise on hand, while trying to find the last, true safe place on Earth.

While the past entries in the Resident Evil film series have been good, but not great, it's one of the very, very few franchises that has steadily gotten better with each installment, and Afterlife is the best one yet.  The production values are surprisingly high throughout, featuring solid effects, fantastic cinematography that creates a wonderfully gloomy atmosphere, and best of all, lots of action.  From beginning to end, Resident Evil:  Afterlife is packed to the brim with exciting action sequences, the highlight of which is a water drenched battle with a massive, axe-wielding monster.  This is a film more interesting in hurling monsters and rabid zombies at your face, rather then debating the finer qualities of the human condition.

Now, I will admit that as a fan of the video games this movie is based off of, I am somewhat biased in my review of the film.  There are plenty of little errors that are common in the genre, from a paper thin plot, thin characters, and an ending that sets up yet another sequel, instead of ending a few minutes earlier and being a self contained story.  And yet...even knowing the flaws were there, I still had a fantastic time watching the gunfights, monster battles, and all the explosions, and seeing the games I enjoy coming to life before my eyes.

In the end, Resident Evil:  Afterlife is really meant for fans of the games the movies are based on (complete with plenty of winks and nudges towards moments from the games themselves).  People who haven't played the games will struggle to make sense of the characters, the genetically engineered super powers, and what's going on in general, but even then, fans of post apocalyptic action films, zombies, and monsters can enjoy it as well (and for horror fans, there are even a few genuinely scary, jump-out-of-your-seat moments).  The film sets out to be a fun, action packed B movie, and in that aspect, it completely success.  Highly recommended.",1284076800,5,2922,4.926530612244898
4270176,5,B0046MOVD0,"This by far is my favorite Resident Evil movie I've ever seen. I would see it over and over, but I'll just see it 2 or 3 times before it comes out on blu-ray since I don't want to spend $9 per ticket. I've played Resident Evil 5 alot, and online with friends and I've had it since it came out on PS3, then got the Gold Edition when mine got ruined by my little sister(talking about the disc). I would recomment any Resident Evil fan to see this movie, because its not only in 3D, but its got top characters from RE5. If you think this movie is good, say so and rate the movie like I have, cause all my friends are gonna go see it. Thats over 50 people right there. Anyways, I rate this movie 10/5, but since I can't rate that high, its a big 5/5.",1283990400,7,746,3.947019867549669

4270243,4,B0046MOVD0,"After the world is devastated by a zombie apocalypse Alice searches the world for survivors.  Ending up in an LA prison turned fortress she must lead the survivors to a possible sanctuary.

This is another fun installment in the RE series.  It starts with a real kick, as Alice and her army of clones fight their way into (yet another) secret underground lab.  The whole sequence has a lot of style and action and feels like the Matrix films (back when they were good).  After that things get a little predictable with survivors holed up in a prison (did RE do it before the Walking Dead?).  And there's a coincidence that strains suspension of disbelief, but at the this stage who cares any more.  No one is coming in expecting Shakespeare.

My only advice is skip this version and get the 5 film set, currently $15~$20.  Or wait a year or two for the inevitable 6 film set.

4270247,5,B0046MOVD0,"I won't comment on ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" as a film, it is well known to fans of the series. But I will say that what I have read elsewhere about the difference between the Blu-Ray and the 4k UHD disc versions to be absolutely true: The 4K UHD image is a vast upgrade over the generally terrible transfer used on the standard Blu-Ray disc. Not that the 4K UHD image for ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" is especially great as a 4K UHD presentation. But the 1080 Blu-Ray transfers is so mediocre that the huge up-tick in clarity and texture on the 4K UHD disc just jumps right out at you. This is surely a film that had its many special effects finished in 2K intermediate for editing. Some scenes are just inherently soft. So any increases in quality is a plus. The image is just much better resolved on the 4K UHD disc.",1493164800,4,818,4.3881578947368425

4270262,3,B0046MOVD0,"Yup Milla Jovovich and her clones are back to killing even more zombies...

Paul W. S. Anderson (Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, Soldier) returns to the beloved Zompocalypse franchise and, apparently, he thought he was directing a Matrix sequel. No sooner are we re-acquainted with Alice (Milla Jovovich; The Fifth Element, Resident Evil 1-3, Ultraviolet) than we see her in Blade II ninja gear running across walls and spiraling through the air dodging slow-motion machine gun fire as bullet casings rain to the ground, their chiming on the floor punctuated by the hum of her twin katanas as she minces her way through dozens of Umbrella SWAT guards.

Coming after Wesker (Shawn Roberts; xXx: The Return of Xander Cage) at the Tokyo Umbrella headquarters, Alice has come full-force with twin Uzis, a leather and tights ensemble, andas she promised at the end of Extinctiona whole bunch of her(s).  Despite the impressively attractive army of Jovo-clones, her plan backfires when Wesker neutralizes her T-virus; stripping her of her superpowers.

The franchise has taken us from the heart of Raccoon City to the Las Vegas desert and now we are swept to the beautiful Alaskan wilderness where the now human Alice is reacquainted with Claire (Ali Larter; House on Haunted Hill, Final Destination 1-2, Resident Evil: Extinction), and off to a dilapidated Hollywood where several survivors (including a slimy Kim Coates; Sons of Anarchy, Innocent Blood) have taken refuge in a prison besieged by zombies.

As the franchise progresses, so does the virus.  The hastened zombies now have quad-unhinging tentacle jaws (like Blade IIs vampire meets Hellboys Sammael; both predating Afterlife) and are joined by a giant axe-wielding hooded ogre (think Silent Hills pyramid head; also predating Afterlife).  It looks cool but both the film and the monsters execute poorly.

Despite all the action (and theres a lot), the quality of the special effects seem to have dropped considerably since Extinction and I was unimpressed with the explosions and fights.  Im not sure if this was an actual budget issue, or if Anderson dedicated so much attention to how this would look in 3-D that he never stopped to consider how it would look on a television.  Perhaps it was all much prettier with red and blue glasses on the big screen?

Alice and Claire fight the giant ogre mutant and, outside of the monster looking cool, it bored me.  Yes, there was slow-motion giant axe-throwing, slow-motion water pipes bursting and slow-motion sliding across the wet floor by soaking wet ladies.  But Ive got news for you, Anderson, slow-motion does not equal good.  Its a shame, too.  Anderson clearly tried to make this a worthy rollercoaster of excitement to follow up parts 1-3butAlice running in slow-motion through a field of head-bursting zombies with quarter-roll buckshot just isn't doing it for me. I miss Russell Mulcahy (Razorback, Highlander 1-2, Resident Evil: Extinction)can we bring him back?

Dodging slow-motion bullets and sunglasses, the black leather-clad Wesker goes full-on Agent Smith, hellbent on consuming Alice as she iswait for itthe one who can help him tame the T-virus. #MatrixEyeRoll

The highlights of this movie include the sheer fun of an army of Alices in the opening sequence, gorgeous shots of Alaska, the crisp sweeping interior shots of the ship Arcadias lower research decks, and the return of the weirder-than-ever zombie dogs.  The story is developed a bit and we are introduced to the Umbrella heart spiders, but nothing feels further explained; another weak point of this installment.

I have had a blast revisiting parts 1-3. However, I can comfortably say that this Zombiegeddon sequel was by far the least gratifying and least entertaining.

Resident Evil is like the Fast and Furious franchise of horror action in that they are always already planning on part 5 before part 4 hits theaters; complete with closing scenes revealing premise points with future villains.  Watch out for the Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory; Resident Evil: Apocalypse, The Time Machine) stinger at the endas every other Resident Evil film has so far to harbinger its soon-to-come sequel.",1488758400,,4196,5.1683899556868536

Anderson's script to Afterlife. It's a great filler since there never was a movie novelization for the film. Give it a read.

4270328,4,B0046MOVD0,Fun and action filled. Very convoluted plot but entertaining none the less.,1462147200,,75,5.333333333333333
4270329,4,B0046MOVD0,"This movie sets up the second Resident Evil trilogy, and takes place sometime after the events of Afterlife, in which Alice finds her other clones.  It marks the return of Paul W.S. Anderson to the director role, having written all the movies, but directed just the first.  It starts out with Alice attacking the Tokyo umbrella facility, trying to take down Albert Wesker, who was shown basically as a hologram in the third movie.  She ends up losing her powers and then ends up trying to evade another zombie horde while holed up in a prison and find Arcadia and the refugees she sent off during the events of Afterlife.

I will not say more about the plot, because to do so would spoil too much.  The film brings back the character of Claire Redfield played by Ali Larter, and also introduces the character of her brother Chris, played by Wentworth Miller.  They are holed up with a new group of refugees, most notably the character Luther West, played by Boris Kodjoe.  The climax of the film basically involves trying to take down Wesker, as well as a rescue.

For those who get the blu-ray, the movie looks and sounds great like the others.  I have the regular version, so I cannot tell you how the 3d version is, but it is much like the other films have been in 2d.  There are deleted scenes, outtakes, multiple commentary tracks on the movie, and several behind the scenes and making of features.  Good for what is there.  By now everyone knows what the movies are and are not.  Most likely, if you have liked the other movies, you will still like this one, although you have to be okay with it moving farther from the kind of basic zombie movies that parts 1 and 2 were and having ever evolving threats.  It will not win any acting or writing awards, but it is a good action, sc-fi, horror blend, and makes for an entertaining movie if you enjoy the genre.",1461542400,,1864,4.460176991150442

4270443,2,B0046MOVD0,"All Resident Evil movies follow the exact same trajectory:  Alice and several others either arbitrarily or all too conveniently find themselves at Point A.  They then spend the entire movie fighting to get from Point A to Point B, and all, so far as I can tell, for no reason other than so that they could have done just that:  shot and killed and blown things up while travelling from Point A to Point B.  In this essential way, the movie is absolutely no more complicated than a video game, which should be a slight clue that something is wrong.

But what is wrong with that?  In theory, it would be possible to make a good action film based on that simple premise, but for one problem:  the action is boring.  Nearly every move or moment of any consequence is placed in slow motion.  The good guys are so good that they seem nearly invincible, to the point where nothing is suspenseful.  Just how much would you worry about a guy if you once saw him single-handedly fight off dozens of attackers, with style and ease, and now he is about to face just one more?  When they talk about this great, impending danger, it falls completely flat, like some dominating boxing champion talking about what a formidable opponent the loser they signed up to get walloped by him is.

The predictability of the plot, the flatness of the dialogue, the sterility of the action scenes, it all adds up to a boring movie that just doesn't work.  But then, that is true of all of these movies, and if you've come this far in the series, you probably can't be persuaded to turn back now.",1425945600,,1568,4.440559440559441

4270460,1,B0046MOVD0,"Why was this movie made?

Seriously, who thought that dogs with their whole bodies turning into mouths, and giant zombies with hammers, just HAD to be in a movie?  Are you really expecting me to believe that this guy just found this hammer thing laying around somewhere?  Or that Umbrella really custom made him this weapon?  Were there a bunch of scientists sitting around in Umbrella one day thinking about weapons to give to zombies and some guy said, ""Hey I know!  How about a big hammer that looks so ridiculous that the only time you would ever see it in the real world would be at a comic book convention?""  And then suddenly everyone agreed with him that it was a great idea and put a purchase order in for that?  This was just stupid!

Okay moving on.  While I was watching this movie, I was able to call out pretty much everything that was going to happen before it happened.  As soon as I saw the guy in the suit on top of the building, I knew he was going to betray everyone.  Soon as I saw the floor of the showers, I knew something was going to burst out of it.  Soon as I saw Luther go down into that tunnel and everyone gave him up for dead, I knew that he wasn't dead and we'd see him make a triumphant return.  Hell even when I heard the recording from ""Arcadia,"" I knew that it was a trap set up by the Umbrella Corporation.  This movie is just completely predictable!

Oh and let's not forget the constant things flying through the air toward the camera just so it would look cool in 3D.  You can't just throw 3D effects up on the big screen and ignore a plot!  Give us a story!  Another thing that doesn't make sense to me, what is the deal with this ""T-Virus?""  Why does this virus have to make her into a Final Fantasy character complete with telekinesis, pyro-kinesis, and other abilities that you would only see in a Matrix movie?  What was wrong with just having it make her tougher, faster, stronger and a faster healer?  I guess that would mean they would have to rely on writers instead of special effects guys to make a movie interesting.

The first Resident Evil movie was good, it gave us Alice's back story.  The second one was good, it showed us what happened in Raccoon City and gave us some supporting characters.  But after that these movies just took a dive.",1423526400,,2296,4.3107476635514015

Then it ends on a cliffhanger, which doesn't even get to the ending it started with!

This one actually incorporates a few things from the game that Extinction failed to bring to the big screen. Wesker, Clare, Chris and even a few of the grotesque creatures that were featured in the more recently made Resident Evil installments.

Teaser: The Executioner makes an appearance in this one with a fight scene. I was pretty happy about that.

However, I noticed that this movie depended a lot on the special effects (specifically slow motion) to keep it's viewer wanting more.

The worse decision the makers ever made was to center the movies around a character that was never in the Resident Evil games and make everything else window dressing.  This movie has made me never want to see Retribution or any further sequels.,1409875200,,441,4.7631578947368425

4270522,5,B0046MOVD0,"Part of the joys of this series is that while it has a rich history and world it keeps building upon, each new entry is easy for beginners too. Every film almost acts like a reboot into a new subgenre of this sci-fi/horror series.

For this 4th film, after a stunning shoot-em-up opening replete with Matrix-level effects, carnage and destruction, the meat of the story is a pretty bare-bones tale of survival and escape from a prison during a zombie invasion (pre-Walking Dead,) featuring a smaller cast and scale than some of the other films. But while the setting is more intimate than usual, the effects have not been skimped on, featuring some fantastic creatures and awesome ""boss"" beasts.

Jovovich is simply the best action heroine going today bar none, with great intensity and emotion and killer moves.

The grand finale is also fantastic in its adventurous mystery, embracing the rich potential of the premise by having another ultimate sequence filled with sci-fi, action and horror as only these movies can.",1406592000,,1020,4.953216374269005

You can clearly tell that it was shot solely to be viewed in 3D just based on the ways the characters interact with the world - especially the giant zombie thing with the ax. But even with these obligatory 3D action shots there are zombies and action and death and in the 4th movie of a series I was happy that those things existed.

4270572,4,B0046MOVD0,"It works for me.

""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" (2010) is the 4th installment in the series, which started with 2004's ""Resident Evil"". These are the only two films I've seen in the series so I obviously don't consider them ""must see"" movies and, yet, I have to admit to being thoroughly entertained when I do. They're basically superhero vs. zombies flicks with loads of style and pizazz. You can't take 'em too seriously and, yet, the stories & characters are ironically dead-serious.

I call these ""superhero"" flicks because that's what Milla Jovovich is as Alice in a ""last people on earth"" scenario. She's dressed in a skintight black outfit with a weapons harness and looks stunning throughout. In this segment she meets up with Claire (Ali Larter) and they fly to a Los Angeles prison where a small group are holed-up against the legions of zombies. They seek to get to an offshore ship, a thought-to-be safehaven from the hordes.

Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson is an expert at making great-lookin' movies with a cool sense of style. In addition, the score and soundtrack are excellent.

Being based on a video game, which I've never played, there's loads of action, which gets cartoony at times (e.g. the giant with the axe).

The best part is the women. It's hard to choose who's better: Milla or Ali. They're both great, but Ali might have the edge. As magnificent as these two are, they throw in more, like the gorgeous Kacey Barnfield.

Taking it for what it is, ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" is a dang entertaining movie.

In this film, Alice meets up with Claire and Chris, and a few other survivors. They are trapped in a building surrounded by zombies, and they want to reach a ship on the other end of the city. There is a message coming from the ship saying that any survivor can go there to be safe. The group fights off many zombies until they reach the ship. When they get there, they find out it is a trap set up by Wesker. He is now fused with the virus in some way, and he has superpowers. The group must fight him off and save the people trapped in the ship.

This movie has lots of action and cool looking zombies. The 2nd film called ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' is still my favorite, but I like this film a lot too.",1373414400,,876,4.147058823529412

The opening sequence and the final sequence really channel the stylistic over the top action of the Matrix films while having none of their gravitas or aspirations.  The zombie deaths are both predictable and boring (based almost entirely on archetype).  If I wasn't just a zombie and Milla fan, I'd probably be sad I lost time watching this.  As it stands, I still liked it.  I just recognize that it sucks.  =)

I hear the next one does a lot of retcon.  But that's okay.  I'll watch it.  I like pain.",1369785600,3,549,4.510204081632653

4270610,3,B0046MOVD0,"I am going to disagree that this series is running out of steam.  I think the fourth redeemed the series by giving us a sharper, flashier and a slightly better movie that it's predecessor.  Resident Evil: Afterlife begins with another narration by Alice followed by a depiction of the T-virus outbreak in Tokyo, Japan. In the fourth movie, Alice and her clones take the war to CEO Wesker (played deliciously with panache by Shawn Roberts) after dispatching the biologically-altered Dr. Isaacs at the end of Resident Evil: Extinction.  The movie mainly focuses on Alice looking for Arcadia and then finding out what it really is, helping Claire Redfield regain her memory after being controlled electronically, helping a group of human survivors who are walled up in a California prison and going after CEO Albert Wesker and The Umbrella Corporation. The confrontations and exchanges between Alice and Wesker are what keeps the story line going.  The prison battle scene with the seven-foot Axeman is scary.  Along the way, Claire is re-united with her brother, Chris and K-mart is rescued from The Umbrella Corporation's clutches.  We also find out that Officer Jill valentine who was last scene with L.J. and Officer Carlos Olivera rescuing Alice at the end of the second film, Resident Evil: Apocalypse has been captured and is now controlled by The Umbrella Corporation.  The ending tells everyone another film is coming.

The script is not as good as the third movie's but the movie looks and feels great due to the incredible camerawork.  Yes, there are numerous 'matrix-type' scene rip-offs but they work.  There is no originality here but the film does hold your eye.  I enjoyed this movie because of Paul Anderson's style and movie-making skill and the performance by Milla Jovovich (now his wife in real life).  While I enjoyed it but it is not the strongest of the series.  it is still worth the viewing time.",1367107200,,1919,4.959375

Knowing that something is so bad, and yet continuing to participate in it, isn't that called masochism? I'm no sadist, and the film doesn't deserve these words, but just saying, it's so bad it's good--the acting, the special effects, the PLOT. Oh, the plot is a sadist if there ever was one, and anyone who doesn't turn off the film, but watches it to the end must certainly be a masochist. Oh, dear, I find myself unable to review this film without using those two words, after all. Well, my advice is, know what you're getting into, because it's one giant STINKER!!

So, wait, what? Are the zombies and monsters real? How is the computer generating real live zombies? The movie didn't make a lot of sense and I found myself not excited by the action sequences because I knew the zombies or monsters weren't real.

The first 10 minutes alone make it worth the purchase as it was clearly built for a 3D audience. The storyline was also enjoyable - yes that's going against all the critics. If we believed critics then every Oscar winning movie should be a blockbuster but it's not. Critics - I took two film classes in college - love to talk about artistic style but it's more along political ideology or what they view from a personal belief of what is a great movie.

Movies were created in America for one reason - to escape reality. That simple and that's the truth. With that said, this is a movie based on a video game that's based on zombies, something that doesn't exist in the real world. When you take it from that perspective and ignore the baseless realities of critics you'll also enjoy the movie.",1362960000,,877,4.48125

I have enjoyed the Resident Evil series, even though I love the video game and hate the way the movies distort the material, but this movie is about the limit of ability to follow along.

The movie starts off as confusing, and quickly makes its way into the realm of ""come on!"" and ""what?! Seriously?"" Furthermore, all of the zombies, zombie ""captains"", and even Wesker, seem to have been taken directly from RE5. However this is a good movie to watch with some people that like talking over movies, as there is little dialogue worth listening to.

I would not recommend this movie, but I did enjoy it in a certain fashion.

4270665,3,B0046MOVD0,"Alice returns to destroy the evil Umbrella Corporation once and for all, but her journey leaves her trapped with a small band of survivors in an abandoned prison compound that is surrounded by thousands of the undead. It will be up to her to find an escape and lead the group to the safe haven known as Arcadia. Paul W.S. Anderson has outdone himself once again in RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE, creating the most mindless and over-budgeted entry in the series. Anderson's complete lack of concern for story and character is more apparent than ever. From beginning to end, there is no progression or expansion on any of the events from the previous films. It is an unnecessary chapter at best, and a boring one at that. Several new characters are introduced from the video game series, only to be given fewer lines and background than they had in their playable forms. The one place where RESIDENT EVIL continues to excel is in the fast-paced and explosive action sequences, although most are self-indulgent attempts to exploit the 3-D gimmick used in the film's theatrical release. Unfortunately, the open ending lends proof that Anderson's career will continue onward to bigger (but not better) things.

If you haven't seen the movie they are running around an Umbrella facility that is built to duplicate different cities for training. So you'll see Moscow, Tokyo and a suburan American town etc. I enjoyed the last movie but it and this movie have a similar flaw, there isn't much character development. We are introduced to three new characters, who also happen to be in the games including fan favorite Leon Kennedy, but we never really find anything out about them. The action is great as usual but the depth of character seems to be missing. Also the movies are starting to feel more like episodes than whole movies. This could end up being a good thing if there is an overall arc planned that pays off in the sixth movie or beyond.

4270693,4,B0046MOVD0,"Alice is back!  That's right.  Our favorite zombie-slaying heroine is back for the fourth installment of the popular Resident Evil franchise.

The story picks up from where the last movie ended, and starts off with Alice and her ""sisters"" attacking the underground Umbrella facility in Tokyo.  If you will recall from the previous movie, Alice told Albert Wesker, the CEO of Umbrella, that she will be coming after them.  True to her word, Alice and her clones fight their way through the security forces and confronts Wesker.  However, Wesker escapes.  But not before activating a timed explosion that destroys the facility, and kills the clones.  Alice and Wesker fight inside the tilt-rotor.  Wesker manages to stick Alice with a syringe that neutralizes her special abilities, but in so doing, took his attention from piloting the aircraft.  The plane crashes.  We see Alice walking away from the wreckage.

Months later, we see Alice on a plane flying towards the source of a mysterious radio signal from a group called Arcadia.  Upon landing, she is attacked by Clare Redfield.  After sorting matters and removing the controlling apparatus from Clare's chest, the two fly south towards the west coast.  Eventually arriving in what was once Los Angeles, they make a risky landing on the roof of the city penitentiary.  They join forces with the last survivors in the city.  Meanwhile, outside the prison, zombies are trying to break through the iron gates.

I don't want to spoil the movie for you.  But this is your typical RE movie.  Lots of action from the main characters.  Jovovich is fun to watch.  Lots of great stunt work.  But alas, the lickers do not make an appearance.  However, a sack-masked, axe-wielding T-103 does make an appearance and goes on a killing rampage.  The plot is fairly simple, naturally.  The focus is on the action and on MJ.  Joining Mila in this movie are series regulars Ali Larter, Boris Kodjoe, Kim Coates, and Shawn Roberts.",1357171200,,1967,4.9176829268292686

4270700,3,B0046MOVD0,"And why do I punish myself every time by watching it?

  I will admit that I've been waiting a good while to see RE:Afterlife. I always catch these things when they hit the video shelf. I like Milla Jovovich for the most part she picks some interesting movies to act in. I admit my 3/5 is biased because I like her. I never liked any of the Resident Evil movies because they never stuck to the story of the game. It's kind of just cameos mixed in with random action. The games aren't like this at all. Actually the playing the game is closest to The Walking Dead. You most of the time are trying to get from point A to point B while making discoveries and running into people along the way. You never actually try to take on Umbrella like Milla does in the films, matter of fact no one has supper human strength or does any of that stuff you see her doing. You don't get an arsenal of weapons or anything and if you're lucky you might find one good gun or two and fire it only when you need too because ammo is scarce.

 Also I've never seen Alice find a typewriter ribbon or blue and green herbs to heal her wounds. Although I will say she has impeccable inventory management when she showed off her arsenal in this film...Of course, I am kidding about nit picking all those little things. The movies never worked for me because they are always over the top and it's obvious that the people who created these films have never played the game...at all. The games actually have a deeper plot/story line than this movie. This is mostly Terminator meets the Matrix with Zombies. Resident Evil has so many good characters I don't understand why they created Alice to develop a story around. This isn't really Resident Evil if it has nothing to do with any of the characters from the game. It's just a Zombie science fiction movie using the Resident Evil trademark and some of the themes from the game. Aside from those two things nothing else about the movies has anything to do with the game.

Now how is THIS movie? Well? That's the thing I'm trying to point out about this series. This movie is the exactly the same as the last two. It's just Alice fighting Zombies and then at the end facing the Umbrella Corp. again. The zombies at least have evolved somewhat though, and aren't the usual biters. However,  they are just in the background and not a major part of the story (seems strange for a game about zombies). The plot of this movie is about Alice finding out what happened to a refuge station called Arcadia. She just does exactly what she did in movies 1-3 to get there.

There is a lot of action in the movie, it's cool and it's fun to watch Milla do what she does best on film but these movies really have nothing to do with the game they are based off of. They took the games plot and characters and completely destroyed it all. At this point in the series it's too late to care and too late to complain so I just watch the movie knowing what to expect and leave it realizing I saw exactly what I think I would see. Like the console game the movies too seem to be trying to dish out as many sequels as they can to cash in on the franchise.",1356566400,2,3150,4.273489932885906

As great as these franchises are, they both have one thing in common; one installment that is good but not great and doesn't really do anything except ride the coattails of the other installments.  For me, ""Afterlife"" was that installment just as Aliens 3 was in that franchise.  It was fun but it just seemed to be the first part of a whole.  It's as if the movie they wanted to make was to long, so they chopped it in half with that big monsterous zombie axe and released it as a stand alone installment.  I gave it a four because it is almost awsome.  One thing I hated was the Matrix copycat scenes.  Resident Evil is good enough that they don't need to copy someone elses decade old idea.

Throw in some zombies following Alice as she jumps off the top of a massive prison, a giant with a massive war hammer and Ali Larter helping her to kick monster butt, and you have a great popcorn movie.

4270742,3,B0046MOVD0,"A disappointing installment in the Resident Evil series.  At this point, it's all about the fighting, no plot required.  They simply alternated the mad tussles with travel sequences, the idea being put Alice (Milla Jovovich) in places where she can fight, move on, fight, move on...............  Nothing is resolved, there are still an endless number of zombies roaming freely while the Umbrella Corporation shows no signs of letting up (why should they when they have an unrealistic number of soldiers at their disposal).  It's an excess of absurdity with only pockets of humanity left, caught between the two raging hordes.  I'm left wondering just what the objective of the Umbrella Corporation is, it's not as if they've any consumers left.  The few stragglers are kidnapped for experimentation.  World domination is hardly worth the effort.  Soon they will be fighting each other.  Until then, do they expect Alice to carry on while cities still burn, a variety of mutant zombie creatures show up, and people still need rescuing.  Will she be doing this with a walker, a geriatric soldier of misfortune?  I'm beginning to wonder.

In this episode, Alice takes a meandering journey to reach another holdout of humanity, trapped in a prison.  This new cast is quickly disposed of, no chance for their personalities to register, a meager body count.  The bad guy/special guest star villain is just a smirk in dark glasses, a reject from the Matrix (did they forget which movie series they were making?), caught sitting on a throne  no less.  I laughed, I don't think I was supposed to.

The first film still remains my favorite, the rest pale, I've kept them anyway, this one too, and I will keep watching them.  I can always fast-forward through the dull bits.  Maybe, eventually, they will get it right again.",1349568000,,1813,4.943708609271523

After LOVING the first 3 movies in this series, I'm sad to report I was disappointed by ""Afterlife"". The first 3 films had so many taught, tight, and tense actions sequences. Lots of close quarters and surprises. More infected goo than you could shake a stick at. An evolution of a heroine unfolded in front of our eyes. (Which was a real surprise in a bloody sci-fi action film.) This movie? Has Alice. Has Claire. Has infected. Has the Umbrella corporation. Has some good action, but it doesn't have any of STORY or HUMANITY that surfaced in the previous movies.

Everyone seems to be moving in slow motion. It felt as if they were marking time just to get to the next film. There aren't any real connections between characters; not even with Alice. Alice herself seems to be completely uninterested most of the time; even after finding Claire and some survivors in Los Angeles. By the way - the survivors in Los Angeles seemed pretty healthy for folks that had been living like that for what(?) over 4 years?

There were some good action sequences, especially the opening scene (which was pretty fantastic) but unfortunately mostly they were TOO stylized. And again - in SLOW MOTION too often. There wasn't the same anxious and desperate survival feel as we were given in the other films. Even so, it wasn't all bad. It was somewhat entertaining and for fans of the series it does have important information for the next film.  I do hope that they return to more of the style of the first 3 movies when they give us the 5th. And maybe actually give us a final resolution.

On a side note, I hope they leave Wentworth Miller out of it. He was horrible. Utterly horrible.

SPOILER ALERT:
I'm not so sure that Alice doesn't still have powers. I know he ""cured"" her early on in the film but she still seemed to be ""better than everyone"". So...yeah.",1345420800,,2096,4.45953002610966
4270756,4,B0046MOVD0,"This film was my introduction to the ""Resdient Evil"" franchise.  I've always avoided zombies movies, but I was looking to add another 3D movie to my collection, so I took a chance.  Though the story was about as brainless as the poor souls infected with the T virus, the action and gore were good (if not over the top), and the 3D effects were among the best I've ever seen.  In fact, I had a better 3D experience with this film than I did with ""Avatar"" because ""Avatar"" didn't have enough pop-out effects for my taste.  ""Afterlife"" was filled with them and also offered plenty of depth.  I got the first 3 flicks in this franchise after seeing this one just to satisfy my curiosity, but I didn't have as much fun watching them simply because they were all 2D movies.  (I'm glad I found used copies of them for dirt-cheap prices.) If the 3D in this film weren't so good, I'd knock off a star.  I'd say buy this just for the 3D if that's your main interest in it.  Otherwise, you should know the story here isn't very deep, and the action features that ""Matrix"" style type of wire work with lots of green screen shots (some of which work, and some of which don't).",1345248000,,1163,4.3271889400921655

If you don't play video games and I don't, there will be some disorientation going from one film to the next. Anyway, I enjoyed the visuals of the burning and abandoned city and the humongous prison citadel in the middle of it. The action was non-stop and kept my attention...I was never bored.

4270769,4,B0046MOVD0,"Well, it has to be your own for the most part. Look at the wide variety of ratings for this movie. Most of the 1-3 star rated reviews mainly talk about how bad the movie is for the acting, writing and so on. To me, no, it was not the better of any in the franchise but it was not unwatchable as some remarked. There's some pretty cool stuff going on. Some are complaining that ""this is a zombie movie, where are all the zombies""? The fact is that this is NOT a zombie movie. It's a thriller about a woman infected with a virus but instead of turning into an un-dead, flesh-eating creature, she aquires exceptional abilities and vows to destroy the corporation/people/person responsible who are desperately trying to capture her for their own purposes. This is sort of the same complaint people have about, ""The Walking Dead"". Not enough zombies. Hey, I like 'em as much as the next fan but you just can't have zombies in every aspect of the film. They are the main thing that drives the story and are always in the back of your mind, but they don't always have to be in your face. Suspense and fear are key factors in a movie like this. Then read some of the 4-5 star reviews. Those concentrate more on the 3D aspect of the movie. Most have a favorable review yet I've seen others elsewhere that say the 3D effect is nominal for the most part and one might wonder if their 3D glasses were even working. Live action 3D does not look as good as animated 3D. Also remember there are native 3d and conversion 3D movies. Goggle, ""complete list of full hd 3d titles"". Native being the better looking, (like RE:A). Then, are these people using passive or active-shutter glasses? It makes a big difference. I think some people tend to be looking for the 3D so much that they actually miss it. It's kinda like those ""magic eye"" pictures from the '80's. You have to relax and let your eyes naturally focus in then you see the hidden picture. I thought the 3D effect was very good, although it is the only live-action disc I have now.

So, to sum it all up, if your an R E fan, you may like this movie no matter what or you may find it disappointing. I think the 3D effects are very good but remember not everything will have a 3D look as with most any I've seen so far. Thanks for reading.",1328832000,,2279,4.3

4270786,2,B0046MOVD0,"After a brief visit to Tokyo, with her sister-clones, to dispatch the remnants of the Umbrella Corp and deal with that naughty fellow Wesker, Alice is now searching Alaska for Claire and the refugees. She finds Claire, but there's no trace of the others, nor of the fabled, plague free Arcadia. Her peregrinations take her to Los Angeles where she ties up with some more castaways and she disovers that she didn't do a very good job with Wesker and his evil corporation...

And so to the fourth in the series. Resident Evil 3 was showing the strain of an unimaginitive producer and screenwriter and this installment is, I'm afraid, no better. Whereas Extinction was Mad Max 2 with zombies, I suspect that Anderson turned to The Matrix for his inspiration for the large part of Afterlife. So we have Alice in Trinity's skin-tight leather catsuit, Wesker in Neo's Gestapo trenchcoat and shades, lots of bullet-time and falling off high buildings firing pistols and so-on. In fact it's so obvious it's almost embarassing. Once again we are treated to some Grand Canyonesque plot holes: just how far can you fly a Yak 52 on one tank of gas? and how many years did those poor people survive on top of the LA prison complex? By the timeline of the series, they must have been there nearly ten years.

Well, I'm not marking the film on internal consistency alone and I honestly do believe that you probably can land a small plane on top of a building if you get the wind direction right (but to take off again? come on!). However, the film just keeps on compounding the crimes: there's the racial, gender and occupational stereotyping of the LA survivors, the astonishingly long odds of Claire meeting her brother Chris in the jail, the ridiculous, clunky, B-movie dialogue and the arrival of a Nemesis type creature who is incredibly difficult to kill right up until the moment he looks like he's going to win. I'm sorry, but any one or two of the many crimes against humanity I could deal with as a necessary evil to keep the film trundling along, but put them all together and you get a sort of unintentional comedy.

I think that RE1] and RE2 are great and I gave RE3 a three star rating because I felt some loyalty to the brand, but this one barely deserves a two star rating. I shudder to think what the fifth installment will be like. I don't hold out a lot of hope.",1323648000,2,2366,4.549295774647887

4270788,3,B0046MOVD0,"So to begin, I should say I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil series and even though they barely have any resembalance to the games... still fun. This movie put all the effort on its 3D effects but the movie has so many flaws it was impossible to ignore. My friend actually took off his 3D glasses after 30 minutes and started to write a review of how terrible it was. He refused to finish the movie and went home because everyone else wanted to finish. I have seen better acting in a third grade play and we were laughing about how terrible the actors were. Hell, one segment showed blood on the doors and when they panned to another angle everything behind her that was JUST IN THE SCENE was now gone and empty...

The 3D parts were awesome though and the people watching with me even commented that they were really showing off the capabilities of home based 3D TVs.

Final result... movie is great for 3D but you will probably never watch it ever again. It's an overglorified tech demo.

BTW- The ending makes no sense and if you really think about what happened... kind of impossible in any sense for any of that to happen in the time frame given.",1323302400,2,1153,4.328703703703703

4270792,1,B0046MOVD0,"This whole series is a mess.  I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil video games.  I remember hearing rumors of the movie in the mid to late 90s and I was so excited that my favorite game was going to be made into a movie.  Well, since then, I have been nothing but disappointed with each movie.  However, while I have been disappointed with each one, I always felt like they were at least worth watching.  However, Afterlife is just too messed up.  This will probably contain some spoilers, so if you don't want to have anything ruined for you, then stop reading.

Let me say, the very beginning of the movie is awesome.  It is revealed that the T-Virus' world-wide outbreak actually started in Japan, not Raccoon City.  Unfortunately, after this scene that lasts only a few minutes, the movie turns into a mess.

One thing I noticed was that there hardly ever seemed to be any zombies.  This just turned into a straight up action flick with the zombies thrown in only occasionally.  And since the movie series decided not to follow the game series' storyline, what we have are enemies in the movie that make absolutely no sense.

There are Majini zombies in the movie (if you've played RE 5, then you know what I'm talking about) that are completely unexplained.  And why are there Majini zombies?  That's not a property of the T-virus, they are caused by Plagas from RE4 and RE5's storyline.  Also, the Executioner (known as the ""axeman"" in the movie) makes an appearance in the movie.  It is actually pretty cool seeing him, but why is he there and where does he come from?  This is all unexplained.  And ultimately, Majini zombies and the Executioner are both types of enemies that don't belong in the movie.

The thing that really bothers me is that the story could have salvaged after RE Apcalypse.  Because in the game's storyline, after Raccoon City is nuked, that is the end of the T-Virus (actually the G-virus) and Umbrella goes under too.  This opens a brand new storyline of people infected with Plagas... but instead of following this, the movie producers decide to forget the video game storyline, do their own thing and have Umbrella save face and the T-Virus still continues.  So now when new enemies make cameos into the movie series, it makes no sense.  Because they are combining T-virus zombie enemies with Plagas infected enemies.

If all of this weren't bad enough, the movie itself just isn't good either.  At the end of RE: Extinction, we are set up to expect Alice to go to war with Umbrella with countless clones.  I never liked the idea, and apparently neither did the writers.  Because within the first 15 minutes or so, all of the clones are killed off and we're onto a new plot point.  Alice has her ""powers"" stripped away, but you'll never notice as she survives a plane crash unscathed and still is able to pull off all of her same acrobatic moves.

Everything feels nature and when things pop out I go wooah!
I usually don't like 3D movies but I enjoy watching this movie in 3D.

The 2D version is great too. For some reason I feel like the 2D version is sharper than the 3D one, and there is more detail in the colors. I use a PS3 to play this btw.

Now the movie itself.
Solid everything except the acting and story. WEll, there isn't much acting in any of the Resident Evil movies anyways, but the plot is really why I only give it 4 stars. Without the 3D I'll only give this movie a 3-star rating.
I enjoy the first two Resident Evil games and the first two movies, but I do not like where the story is going the the third and forth (this) movie.

4270807,5,B0046MOVD0,"don't believe in the term ""guilty pleasure."" At least, not with regard to movies. Maybe if you were a connoisseur of baby seal steaks or hoodies made from pandas, the attribution would be appropriate, but not when talking about one's taste in films. Take Paul W.S. Anderson's body of work--I'm kind of an easy lay when it comes to his Resident Evil films for reasons both concrete and maddeningly difficult to articulate. They're glossily shot with (at least with Anderson or as with RE: Extinction's Russel Mulchahey behind the camera) and promise at least a few engaging setpieces featuring series lead Milla Jovovich in some kind of improbable action, possibly kicking dogs in the face as her character Alice navigates whatever bizarre and occasionally goofy developments are thrown her way by the increasingly slapdash evil conspiracies at the heart of the series.

I love the series because at its heart, it's a great big silly (okay dumb, but sincere) bit of fun, obviously made for and by geeks (I don't mean this pejoratively) who are really into the games. Each entry promises some truly bizarre development for the subsequent sequel that never full materializes.

Case in point: after the opening shootout in an underground, Japanese facility operated by the Umbrella Corporation--the baddies who created the T-Virus and Alice's former employers--Afterlife quickly dispenses with the more interesting developments from the end of the last film and puts our heroine back on the trail of Claire (Ali Larter) and the remaining survivors from the last installment. With most of the Earth's population decimated by the zombie plague, survivors have been following an automated beacon to Alaska, where they're promised food, shelter, and most importantly, no zombies. Unfortunately, the life Alice is able to find at the site is a feral, dirty Claire, whose memories have been wiped thanks to an insect-like device embedded in her chest.",1318723200,,1941,5.178343949044586

4270810,3,B0046MOVD0,"Ok, I liked the movie, I give it a four for a higher budget horror movie.  But the steelbook which costs 49.00 for a new one is just a bad idea. In fact making blu rays more than ten bucks on older titles is a poor idea and new titles should never be more than 15.00-20.00. Some poor smuck paid 50.00 for this and could have bought the same item in a normal blu ray case for far less. Probably thinking , wow it's going to be collectable!  NOPE.  It isn't at all. Forget steel books and just get a regular cased blu ray. In fact the higher pricing ploys only hurt sales in the long run for all of the blu ray  medium.  That's why regular dvds can now be had for quite cheap, and some were collectors items too. We don't need steelbooks or digital copies or a dvd copy in blu ray packages either.  instead we should have lower prices to sell the format before it's too late and bad ideas like steelbook turn people off from collecting blu rays.  As for the movie it's typical of the series, lots of zombies attack the few survivors left and even some mutants are on the loose too. Will anyone escape alive?  , well mila will and that's ok!

4270818,1,B0046MOVD0,"Nothing can better sum up how I feel than that simple phrase - I just hate this movie - I hate everything about it.  I hate that it came at this point after EXTINCTION gave the franchise a surprisingly strong boost.

The movie is a travesty from the get-go. Well, that's not quite true - actually, the opening credits sequence is pretty cool, ending with the crash zoom out to the heavens.  But, it's when we come back down, and we have this overblown action opening that the problems begin.  After the poorly edited opening action sequence, we are shown how Wekser (ah, Albert...was there ever a more annoying villain in film OR video game!?) uses an injection to remove Alice's T-Virus, and hence, her ""abilities"" - you know, the filmic excuse for her to be able to pull off all her Matrix Rip-Off moves.  This seemed like a very promising concept - and it made sense, for a moment.  Open with the crazy action so fans get their fix, then strip our heroine of her advantage and put her back into the danger zone.

Well, this proves to be short-lived, for IMMEDIATELY following this scene, Alice survives a head-on airplane collision.  Not just survives, but walks out of the wreckage unscathed.  Indeed, the entire duration of the film, you'd have no idea she was fully human again, aside from a knife injury near the end.  Why they introduced this plot point, then never explored it is beyond me.

The film is rife with these kinds of ""go nowhere"" plot points.  In the second act, we are introduced to Wentworth Miller (from FOX's PRISON BREAK- someone must have thought it hilarious to introduce him incarcerated in a prison cell) who insists he knows the way out.  After the characters finally trust him to let him out, he promptly leads them to a door with an ATV inside ... a door anyone of the characters could have found at any time.  And, this proves to lead nowhere anyway - the ATV is non-operational.  So, again, a pointless plot element.

Furthermore - this is a Zombie movie, right?  I ask only because the zombies are barely in the movie.  Other than a final influx in the final act, they only pop up here and there for a quick shoot out, and that's about it.

Ali Larter, who brought a fresh element to EXTINCTION, is relegated to the sidelines for the bulk of the film with a convenient ""memory loss"" theme.  She only comes back in the end for a quick ""look how bad-as$ I am"" fight scene.

Well, it all boils down to a final battle with Wesker, who is apparently 100% indestructible - which means one more boring element added to his already boring character.  And, after the obligatory final action scene, we are left with the threat of yet ANOTHER sequel to come, as our characters are literally left facing an all-out assault (again, not by zombies, but by humans).

My problem with this film is that it just highlights the overall weakness of the entire franchise.  It was based on a series of games that were themselves based on a genre of b-movies.  Yet, none of these films really plays into the zombie-horror mythos - rather, these are thinly veiled Matrix-wannabe action flicks.  Constant slow-motion, humans displaying inexplicable kung-fu powers and imperviousness to injury, and plots that don't even measure up to video game ""standards"" - that's what this franchise has come to represent - and while EXTINCTION gave us a brief glimmer of hope, AFTERLIFE plunges us back into reality - this is just a weak franchise that needs to be put down. Sadly, it makes money - and that's all that matters to the producers - and really, who can blame them?

Poor Milla, meanwhile ... I imagine her at night sitting on the floor in the corner of the room, hugging her knees to her chest and rocking slowly as she contemplates the state of her career, muttering over and over to herself ""I still have THE FIFTH ELEMENT ... I still have THE FIFTH ELEMENT..."" until she finally falls into a restless sleep.",1313366400,3,3921,4.580229226361031
4270819,3,B0046MOVD0,"Afterlife is probably my least favorite in the Resident Evil movie series, but that's mainly because after the first 20 minutes of nonstop generic shooting action, you're unfortunately forced to persevere 40 straight minutes of melodramatic storytelling that features absolutely *no* action whatsoever. Alright, occasionally a tentacle-faced zombie will make an appearance resulting in the main characters cleaning their clock with their always-ready and handy weapons, but that's about all the excitement that occurs during this 40-minute timeframe.

After that, the action picks up when this monster called the Executioner comes into the picture, and this one scene in particular where he tosses his axe around the room and tries to smack Jill and Claire with it is definitely my favorite part of the movie. Besides that, well the head-splitting dobermans are awesome but that's not until the very end. I was honestly hoping the Executioner was Nemesis in disguise, but no such luck.

I have to be totally honest though- the lack of suspense and horror elements is disappointing. I realize by this point we're supposed to be used to the fact that the movie series doesn't deliver the same kind of horror as the Resident Evil video games, but I fail to accept a lack of horror elements in the case of Afterlife thanks to several boring moments that did nothing to entice the viewers.

4270822,3,B0046MOVD0,"Resident Evil's fourth 3-D installment had its work cut out for it: Alice was now an army of clones hell-bent on digging Wesker, leader of the Umbrella Corporation, out of his hole and squashing him like a bug. Wesker was replaced by a more physical actor, which is a good sign - fans of the series know just how tough he really is.

Where the third installment killed off characters in a desperate bid to save the few remaining survivors, this movie is about Alice (Mila Jovovavich) and Claire Redfield (Ali Larter).  After neatly offing the clones, removing her superpowers, and uprooting Wesker, Afterlife switches gears to Alice's lonely search for other human beings.

Mila looks rounder, sexier, more full in this film than she has in all of the other Resident Evil movies put together  Her crystal gaze is as lovely and piercing as ever, and the movie wisely exchanges Alice's thigh-high dominatrix outfit for something more practical. Motherhood suits her.

Claire, on the other hand, starts out suitably mussed and becomes inexplicably more and more glam with every camera shot. She has no other purpose than to be the eye candy got when Alice is unconscious, which isn't very often.

Things pick up when Alice crash lands her plane onto a prison surrounded by zombies.  Paul W. S. Anderson has an eye for interesting shots, and he finds beauty in the grotesque, from a burnt-out Hollywood to the bloody zombie smear left by a low-flying plane. We end with a few new survivor stereotypes who do not disappoint - the sleazy agent, the hopeful actress, the noble sports hero, the miscellaneous guy with an accent, the nerdy guy prone to freaking out.  Most will die - except for the ones we can recognize from the game, in which case they'll stick around to the end.

All the survivors seek Arcadia, a safe haven free from the zombie infection. Arcadia is not what it seems, of course, and then we're back to CGI zombies with tentacles for mouths, dogs that split in half, and really big guys with axes.  None of this is explained and for fans of the series, they don't need to be. We've seen them all in Resident Evil 5.

What's surprising is how the fourth installment is so uninterested in continuity with its own movie canon and focused on staying true to the video game series. Fans of the game will applaud seeing their favorite monsters on the silver screen - everyone else will probably be confused.

All the interesting elements that made the third installment so unique have been jettisoned in favor of tentacles, standard survivor tropes, and big, bad Wesker. Resident Evil Afterlife isn't a bad movie.  It's just not as good as its predecessor.",1311120000,2,2663,4.738095238095238

Movie Resident evil is thriller not horror,not single scare was created by gore or amputations that was good for a mass appeal. So far its the best 3D movie i watched in theater and Home. it share same camera technology as used by James Cameron. Resident evil makes you realise that you are watching 3d version by intermittenly rotating caremas,gun shots or debris throwing towards you. Many people `ll hate it but they are mostly the ones who didn`t invest in 3D tech but those who did`ll mostly like it. There is more feel and involvement in movie even if it is at sake of wearing big glasses. This movie delivers it all and makes it best movie so far to show off your 3D home theater. Its not like Movie UP (Great movie for 2D viewing)and many others who are great for viewing in 2D but why 3D? You are carrying burden of glasses whole time for basically nothing.

4270842,5,B0046MOVD0,"I originally saw Resident Evil: Afterlife in the theaters in 3D and it was a very enjoyable experience that I will never forget. I wish that I could have seen it on the big screen once or twice more but as fate would have it, I was not able to. So I was very much looking forward to seeing it again when I bought it on DVD. Although this review is for the standard DVD only, from what I remember, the 3D for this film was awesome on the big screen. I hope to someday see it again in 3D. But the movie is still very good on its own even without the 3D effects.

Update: I finally obtained Resident Evil Afterlife on Blu Ray in 3D and let me tell you, this movie looks AWESOME in 3D at home. If you have a 3D TV and a Blu Ray player that can handle 3D disks then do not hesitate to get this movie, it looks amazing! I give it the highest rating and recommendation possible.

Paul W.S. Anderson wrote and directed this installment and he did a fabulous job. He is one of my favorite directors and I love most of his films from Mortal Kombat, to Death Race, and this one is one of his best features yet. It is loaded with great action scenes, lots of suspenseful moments, and beautiful slow motion visuals. It also features one of the coolest movie monsters yet in the form of the giant lumbering Executioner monster which carries and swings a ridiculously huge hammer/axe thing at his victims. The Executioner looked awesome in 3D, especially when he would swing and throw his big hammer/axe at the viewer! This movie is a Horror Action/Thriller movie fans dream come true. If you loved Resident Evil Extinction, you will definitely enjoy this film as well. I can't wait to see what they do with the next installment!",1302393600,2,1714,4.303405572755418

4270848,5,B0046MOVD0,"The Resident Evil movie franchise get's a lot of crap critically, and I never really understood why. To me the point of watching a movie is entertainment, and fun. That's exactly what this movie gave me. Sure the plot isn't that deep, but I don't think this or any of the other Resident Evil movies really need some big, epic plot. It's simple. Zombie's have overtaken the world, and outnumber the humans. Survive, and try to keep the human race alive. That's your plot, and that's all you really need.

This movie has just about everything you could ask for in a zombie movie, and more. Zombie's, action, good looking girls, blood, and some pretty awesome fight scenes. I originally saw this in theaters in 3d, and really enjoyed it. When I saw it released on blu-ray I questioned if I enjoyed it more, because of the 3d. After watching it even without the 3d I enjoyed it just as much. I'm sure the 3d blu-ray would make it even more fun.

The movie comes with a bunch of special features including commentary, behind the scenes, outtakes, and more.

If your debating watching this, my advice would be to go into it open minded, and without expectation. If you enjoy action I think you'll be more than satisfied.",1302048000,4,1214,4.559633027522936

I actually bought this DVD, watched it, then immediately put it up for sale.  Maybe if you were a die-hard Res Evil video game fan, or read the books, you would like it.

4270851,5,B0046MOVD0,"I've always been a fan of the Resident Evil video game series, I've played every Playstation iteration of it and loved them all. When they made the first RE movie I thought for sure it would be just as horrible as every other game-based movie, but much to my surprise I really enjoyed it and have also enjoyed the sequels. Sure the movies are campy, but that's a large part of their charm in my opinion. We recently purchased a 3D capable Sony Bravia and this was the first movie I popped into it to check the 3D capabilities. Wow! WOW!!!! WOOOOOOW!!!! I was blown away from the very first scene just like I was when I saw it in the theater. This movie isn't just a 3D-ized version of RE, it was clearly made to be 3D from the ground up. Every scene makes jaw-dropping use of the technology, I just can't say enough good things about what they've accomplished in this movie. All the viewing planes are fully utilized- the scenes have an amazing amount of depth and there is enough usage of pop-out elements to keep things interesting without seeming carnival-like. Some of the landscape scenes would be right at home in a National Geographic 3D episode. This is the movie to get out when you want to show your friends what 3D is all about! I won't review the movie storyline itself since that's been done sufficiently by others here, I'll just say that I personally loved it although I can see how it might not appeal to everyone, especially those unfamiliar with the RE games or those who don't care for zombie movies in general. But whether or not you like the content, the dazzling use of 3D is sure to impress nearly anyone. Here's hoping that Hollywood catches on and brings us more eye-candy like this rather than trying to force 3D onto a movie like they did with the Last Airbender disaster.",1301529600,2,1799,4.47112462006079
4270852,4,B0046MOVD0,"I see that this title gets a lot of crap for being a re-hashed ""who cares?"" plot, featuring cardboard acting of yawn-provoking characters polished over with 3D special effects.  ....True, but keep in mind, this IS an adaptation of a video game.  Speaking as a long-time fan of the Resident Evil game series, I can certainly say that even though Afterlife may be arguably the weakest of the series, it's still packed with a lot of fun!

If you've played Resident Evil 5, you'll recognize a lot of nods to the game, including fairly faithful adaptations of the ""Majini"" zombies, the ruthless Undertaker, and a pretty damn good interpretation of Albert Wesker in his final appearance.  (Spoiler: I'm glad they didn't try to do Wesker's ""final"" final appearancein RE5; you know, the one where he melds his arm with a peice of twisted metal and chases you around a volcano?"")  And if you were one of the people who has had enough of Alice and her superhuman clones, relax, because it seems like they responded to all of the negative feedback in the first ten minutes of the movie, in which they not only rid Alice of her T-Virus powers, but also kill all of the clones in one shot.  She's still the main character, but believe it or not, takes a backseat in the final battle, which features predominantly Chris and Claire Redfield, in yet another decently-adapted moment from RE5.

As far as the 3D goes, I have to say I was pretty impressed.  Among the recent surge of 3D in theaters, this was one of the few that was actually filmed in 3D, rather than being converted in post production, so it works.

Overall, it's a fun movie that you don't have to invest too many brain cells in, and don't have to worry in the least about being scared witless afterward.  These movies are basically like playing the video games without doing any of the work, so if you've had a rough day, they're a great way to unwind.",1301443200,,1903,4.538011695906433

4270860,4,B0046MOVD0,"Resident Evil:Afterlife(released Sept/10)is the fourth live action movie of the franchise and from my point of view it is a step up from its' predecessor ""Apocalypse"".The action is hot and heavy,the S/FX are excellent and Milla Jovovich keeps the proceedings well grounded;her character fits her like a glove.
The plot in Afterlife continues where Apocalypse left off. Alice(Jovovich) and her clones from the Umbrella facility in the desert in the U.S. are in Tokyo,Japan and on a mission to destroy the main facility led by Albert Wesker(Shawn Roberts).The clones do most of the dirty work,many getting taken out in the process. Wesker manages to escape in a Black Ops VTOL craft but the original Alice is aboard. Wesker nukes the Tokyo facility from the air but Alice and he duke it out on the aircraft. Alice gets injected with a serum that neutralizes the T-Virus and she becomes human once more. However before either of them can do anything,the aircraft,unpiloted during this time,plunges into the side of a Japanese mountain. Alice is the only one who seemingly walks away from the crash alive.
The scene now switches to Alice who has commandeered an aircraft. She has flown across the Pacific and is heading for Arcadia,Alaska,the place mentioned from Apocalypse that was supposedly infection free. She lands in a field chock full of abandoned aircraft of all types and no one is around. She wanders to a beach but before long is attacked. It turns out to be Claire(Ali Larter) who has a strange metal spider-like device attached to her chest. Alice removes it but Claire,obviously heavily drugged,cannot remember Alice or much else. Alice loads Claire into the two seater plane and both head south along the Pacific coast. In L.A. they encounter a small group on a rooftop who are signaling for help. They cannot land below as it is surrounded by the undead. It's a nail biting sequence but she manages to land successfully on the roof top.
This is the ""Citadel"" prison but they cannot stay too long here as the undead are slowly starting to find ways into the supposedly impregnable facility. In the facility the group is holding one prisoner,a military man,Chris(Wentworth Miller),who got caught up in the exodus of his long gone comrades. He has a way out and,realizing they don't have many options left,the group finally releases him. Upon release Chris looks at Claire and introduces himself as her brother. He tries to hug her but Claire not recognizing him,puts him in a back hand lock. She releases him at Alice's insistence and Alice tells Chris she cannot remember much due to her past ordeal in Arcadia.
Things are going from bad wot worse in the facility.""Knocking"" at the main gate is a huge brute wielding a king sized axe and many of the undead have now mutated into new forms. The newest are now tunneling their way into the Citadel through the walls as they have tentacles that emanate out of their mouths. Not only great for digging but it's how they grasp their victims. The group heads downwards to the sewers,which will lead them to the ocean. Off the coast lies their destination. It is a ship called the Arcadia. This seems to be the source of the transmissions for safe refuge that Alice and the others have been receiving all along,not in Alaska.
They get a boat and board the ship;it seems deserted. Below decks lies huge long containers which contain the answers to some of their questions. It seems the Umbrella corporation has been snatching survivors and putting them in cryogenic freezing for further experimentation. A little farther along they run into none other than Wesker who has been waiting for Alice and her compatriots. Wesker has been monitoring Alice all along and he has now infected himself with the T-virus and hopes with an infusion of the blood Alice carries he can successfully control the bad side of the virus. Alice of course has other plans. First she dispatches his two ""dogs"";also mutants whose heads split open to reveal the creature inside. After their demise she,Claire and her brother finally ""subdue"" Wesker. They release the rest of the cryo-frozen cargo of uninfected but Wesker,thought dead,escapes in a VTOL.He has the same plans to destroy the ship as he did the facility in Japan but this time Alice is one step ahead of him. She has planted a nuclear device on his aircraft which sends Wesker to meet his maker. Alice sends out a radio broadcast to all survivors who may out there offering now a true refuge for them aboard the Arcadia. The movie ends with a slew of VTOL black ops aircraft heading towards the boat as Alice says:""Here comes trouble"".
With that ending we can see another sequel on the horizon,that is for sure. If the producers can keep up their sure fire and imaginative stories for this ever-burgeoning franchise,there is no where to go but up. After life is a definite improvement in story construction and plot evolvement over Apocalypse. The movie moves along at a more brisk pace and doesn't get bogged down in trivials like some its predecessors. Jovovich continues to be the glue that grounds this franchise. She is firmly ensconced in her Alice character and I couldn't imagine anyone else doing the great job she has done so far. This movie also has a plethora of special effects in it and the stunt work is amazing. The film certainly and more than once,references the ground breaking work of the Matrix but Afterlife still stands on its own.
Technically the film has been transferred wonderfully to DVD and is clear and crisp. It appears in its' original a/r of 2:35:1 but is NOT in 3-D,as originally shot. However this lack of 3-D is no deterrent to the films enjoyability. As an aside I cannot wait until this 3-D craze runs its course and disappears from the scene once more. Wearing glasses at a theatre is one thing but at home constantly?......C'mon!!! .Extras include: commentary,trailer,previews,a two featurettes on the action and the cast.
Afterlife is a very good sequel in the Resident Evil franchise,a better turn than its predecessor. The action is swift and sure and the special effects are,once more,top notch. Milla continues in her franchise-grounding role as Alice. Recommended.",1300579200,,6202,4.868495742667928

4270873,2,B0046MOVD0,"I enjoyed the previous Resident Evil movies.  But, this movie seemed to be crafted entirely for the 3D experience, and not so much for advancing the plot.  There is plenty of action, but it's almost all in slow motion to show things coming at the screen.  I don't have a 3D television, so none of this impressed me, and I would have rather seen the action at full speed.

The movie has a terrible plot and dialog.  There are a lot of things that just make you want to yell, ""B.S."".  When Alice is flying into LA and the city has fires all over the place with plumes of smoke everywhere...she notices that there are no signs of life, not even the undead.  Well, who started all the fires then?  Landing a plane on top of a building.  And why did they light so many torches in the prison?  Just how much light do they need?  When did Alice find out how to clone herself?  Where did she find the facilities to do it?  Who's the big guy with the monster Axe and where did he come from?  Shouldn't Umbrella be trying to figure out how to fix the problem or kill all the zombies?  After all, you can't live forever underground.  Sooner or later you'll run out of food and need a safe world to return to.

4270875,1,B0046MOVD0,"And no, I'm not talking about the Resident Evil franchises' ability to frighten its audiences. After four (!) installments, it has become clear that these aren't horror films. These are sci-fi action films. I'm done asking these films to scare me. In fact, I'm done trying to look for anything of any merit in these films. But why watch and review them, you ask? Because it's so much fun to verbally kick in the teeth of the people who inexplicably love these movies enough to warrant more sequels for this franchise. And for the record, I didn't pay a dime to watch this movie, I borrowed my sister's Netflix copy. I resolved not to give the thieves they call producers any of my money long ago. So, let's start the thrashing, shall we?

This film picks up with all the Alice clones launching a full-scale assault on Umbrella Corporation's home office in Tokyo. Albert Wesker, Umbrella's HNIC, manages to escape, but not before encountering the real Alice on his escape chopper. They tussle, and he injects her with some formula that strips Alice of all her cool powers. The chopper crashes, and though we never see if Wesker makes it out (though you know he does), Alice survives. Wait, how did she survive the fiery crash without her powers? Why, with the aid of slow motion, of course! Who needs telekinesis when the world simply slows down to a crawl for you, giving you plenty of time of avoid any kind of physical harm, no matter how deadly and perilous the situation? I guess the T-Virus pandemic has affected the laws of physics and the space-time continuum as well. Great Scott!

Anyway, Alice somehow makes it to Alaska, only to find the safe haven known as ""Arcadia"" to be nothing more than an empty beach. She runs into her pal Claire Redfield, who has some metallic insectoid mind-control device stuck to her chest. After removing it, Claire starts to come to her senses, though her memory is a little fuzzy. Good thing Alice is an expert when it comes to amnesia, since Alice seems to be stricken with amnesia in just about every film in the series so far. So the girls put on their traveling pants and head for Los Angeles, which is a burning wasteland. Somehow, all the buildings are still burning and there are still zombies years after the initial outbreak. Logic would dictate that these walking corpses would have starved to death (or back to death) without anything to eat, and the flames would have also died off. But oh, I'm bringing logic into this review. I keep forgetting that logic does not exist in the Resident Evil dojo.

They come across a handful of survivors who have taken refuge in a prison. Among these survivors is Chris Redfield, Claire's brother. What are the odds that two siblings who haven't seen each other in like FOREVER would both survive a zombie apocalypse and run into each other? That sounds highly illogic....OW! Sorry, I just slapped myself. No logic, remember?

So the refugees concoct an escape plan when it is discovered that Arcadia isn't a place, it's a tanker boat. The ship has set up off the L.A. coast, so Alice and company resolve to head for the ship. Of course, that's easier said than done when there are millions of zombies waiting to tear you apart outside. Oh, and the zombies have now developed tendrils that come out of their mouths and the ability to burrow through the ground. And there's a big dude with a burlap sack over his head dragging an ever bigger ax/meat tenderizer with him. Where'd he come from? Ah, just don't bother to think about it.

So most of the survivors (see: disposable fodder) meet a gruesome end and Alice, Claire, and Chris make it to the vessel. Turns out, Arcadia is a clever (see: predictable) ruse pulled off by Umbrella to round up survivors to experiment on. And who's on the ship? Wesker! Dun dun DUN! Now Wesker wants to eat Alice. Yes, he states his need to digest her. See, he's infected himself with the T-Virus but has managed to control it to an extent, but it's slowly taking over. He wants to chomp Alice because her DNA was strong enough to control the T-Virus, so if he eats her, he'll be able to control the infection within himself. (Why he doesn't bother to try eating her back on the helicopter is never explained.) Get that? No? Well who cares anyway? It's fight scene time!

They tussle, and though Wesker pulls off some wonderful bullet-dodging and acrobatics that would make Neo cream his trench coat, he ultimately takes a lead sandwich from our heroes. But since even bullets can't keep him down, he gets to anothah choppah and flees. But luckily, Alice has planned for this contingency and hidden a nuke on the craft. Ka-boom!

Alice and the Wonder Twins have saved the day. OR HAVE THEY? Swarms of Umbrella choppers approach the Arcadia (loaded with Umbrella soldiers the company seems to magically pull out of their posterior despite the fact that most of the world's population has been turned into zombies), one of which is helmed by mind-controlled Jill Valentine. And so, we get the set-up for yet another unwanted yet inevitable sequel.

In short, these movies are nonsensical crap. AVOID. DO NOT WANT.",1298505600,5,5136,4.661147902869757

Consequently, she can bring a level of drama and expertise to these otherwise tawdry films, like no other.  She has perfected the ""stare.""  With her beautiful but unsettling gaze, you cannot help but accept her as something unnatural, beyond the ordinary, and a fearsome force to be reckoned with.  Mila somehow makes the unbelievable believable, and her undaunting strength is what glues us to the screen.

4270885,4,B0046MOVD0,"Me and my hubby watched this movie last night. I really liked it. Now Resident Evil Afterlife do have it's weak points, and this film is mindless action and little else, but what it is is done quite well. This film have gone back to the more classical zombie survival horror type movie this time. Alice and Claire join a group of survivors holed up in a old jail, Alice have lost her Tvirus powers so while she still fight like nobody's business she no longer have the ability to just mow zombies down at will, zombies actually pose a danger to her. Other than that this film is like the rest, Umbrella is evil, Alice is though and the zombies are hungry.

The action scenes are spectacular, they are well choreographed and very entertaining to watch and this is good as hardly five minutes pass buy without something exploding, someone shooting or some insane acrobatics ending in deader zombies taking place. The special effects for this film is great, it obviously had a big budget. If you are trying to decide whatever or not to get Resident Evil: Afterlife in DVD or blu-ray I would say go for the blu-ray as the visual are definitely the biggest part of this film.

One thing I have to give this film credit for is that it really feels like a computer game, right down to a end boss. Every location and fight have the feel of a level in a computer game and as such this film really pay homage to the games. Now as to the 3D, I do not have a 3D TV so I did not see those effects, however there are several places in the film where a shot is held for a very long time and so on where it is clear that there is some 3D effect going on for those with TV's capable of showing that, however this is never so in your face as to be distracting and while you notice it is there it just blends into the movie.

The plot of Resident Evil: Afterlife is rather thin, if what you are looking for is deep, involving storylines then this movie is not for you, the plot is an excuse to have elaborate action sequences, however the plot do it's job and there is just enough of it to keep the viewer interested in the action. You are not going to come away from this film with a feeling of having seen anything deep and meaningful, but if you like action or zombies then my guess is that you will be entertained. One more note on the action also, Resident Evil: Afterlife is rather full of gore, however the gore parts are filmed in a way that feels very outlandish, I am not saying that it look fake, but it do not give that much of a shock effect so that people who are squeamish about gore might still like this film.

I must also say that I love that Executioner Majini have an appearance in this film, sure the character is a blatant Pyramid Head ripoff, however he looks both impressive and menacing and the scenes with him are my favorites in Resident Evil: Afterlife.

To wrap this review up, I think Resident Evil: Afterlife is a great action film, it has a weak plot, but it is well shot and entertaining and it just plain works. I really enjoyed watching this film, and while it is by no means perfect I think it is very good and I definitely recommend it.",1297814400,,3154,4.241264559068219

This might be the last one although they left it open to push another low budget, storyline and graphics ripoff from other movies, sequel as a possibility. This series actually started out fairly interesting but got progressively worse with each sequel.

Negatives:
(1.) Really cheap wire aerials - spins, flips, wall running, etc. that look a lot like '70s Hong Kong martial art movie effects.
(2.) Matrix high speed camera (therefore super slow effects) bullets and character movement. These days - really boring.
(3.) K-Mart selection of stereotypic characters that have no function other than to provide a minimal amount of drama for the cheapest buck.
(4.) Really lame graphics, almost '80s level in quality and creativeness.
(5.) Unimaginative storytelling. How many movies have zombies surrounding some mini-fortress and tunnel ,or whatever, in and then get blasted just to sell the visuals to zombie audiences.
(6.) Script writers that work for minimum wage of $7/hr because all they can come up with are sentences using no more than seven words per sentence (that's a dollar per monosyllabic word).

1. Milla Jovovich kicks ass.
2. The film score is dynamite.

Personally, I feel that the movie wasn't all that great because of the way the characters appeared. Their portrays are completely different from the game. Plus the new characters didn't have much of a role. Nevertheless, I love watching the heroine Alice fight. She's the only thing that make these films worth watching. Its without a doubt action-packed, but my overall rating for this film is 3 1/2 stars. When it was over, the ending definitely left one word in mind, ""sequel"".

4270914,3,B0046MOVD0,"*May contain spoilers, but not detailed*
I have enjoyed the resident evil movie series ever since the first one came out. The made for movie character,, Alice kind of threw me off at first but Milla totally owns this role and adds to the Resident Evil mix. This 4th installment however, seemed a slight bit lacking. Having watched it only on DVD and not in the theater, this review is based on seeing it only in 2D at home and not in 3D at theater (the way it was probably meant to be seen.)

Pros :
Zombies, Zombies, Zombies
Awesome (sometimes over the top) action sequences start from the opening scene.
It's Milla AND Resident Evil in another zombie killing action flick
Picks up right after the end of RE:3 Extinction
The movie ends wide open. Leaving it open for the 5th installment

Cons :
Most of the CG Elements looked a few notches above a typical SciFi Channel made for TV movie. ie: Weskers dogs(as if they spent more money on shooting the film with James Camerons 3D digital filming methods and equipment rather than giving the attention to the CG portions to make it look more realistic. ""Realistic"" is used loosely of course.)
Though this movie has more zombies than the other films, the interaction with them was minimal.

If you have not been following the movie series I believe I can safely say, this movie is gonna suck to you. Just like the beginning of every RE movie so far, Mila narrates at the beginning catching all watchers up to speed with what has been happening, but if you are just jumping in to the series with this 4th installment, you won't become attached to the characters and won't care much for the film as since there is really no character building in this one. As a fan of the series, I was slightly satisfied with it. The pros are equal to the cons in my opinion, but only if you've been following the series. I read reviews saying, ""If you are a fan of the movie franchise, you will love this""...But I disagree, I'm a huge fan of the movie franchise, but this film left me feeling unfulfilled. I can only hope the 5th one, presumably the last one, ends with a bang and they throw out everything they can into it.

I give this movie a 2 1/2 stars...not 3, but amazon only allows full star ratings, not fractions. It's ok. Nothing spectacular, but still a nice romp through the Resident Evil world.",1296086400,,2338,4.455607476635514
4270915,2,B0046MOVD0,"Another Resident Evil movie, just what we need.  And wouldn't you know it, but writer/producer and director of the first film Paul W.S. Anderson has returned to the director's chair to continue Alice's (Milla Jovovich) quest against the Umbrella Corporation, amid armies of zombies, evil beasts, and other assorted nasties.  The proceedings are pretty predictable, with Ali Larter returning as well as Claire Redfield, and her brother Chris finally makes his film debut, played by Prison Break's Wentworth Miller.  Utilizing top notch 3-D technology, Anderson fills the film with so many slow-motion effects and bullet time moments that you'll find yourself falling asleep.  Why is that you ask?  Because we've all seen this done so many times before, and we've seen it done much better as well.  As a whole, Resident Evil: Afterlife is actually kind of boring, which is really disappointing considering that the previous film, Resident Evil: Extinction, was a surprisingly good installment of this otherwise stale series.

Shame WB won't pull there heads out of there behinds and make the Matrix 4 everyone keeps asking for it just throw down the cash grab the crew and make it! Does this studio want to make money or go bankrupt whatever it takes you want to beat box office records that is your ticket... But anyways back to Resident Evil they kind of left us hanging with Milla getting that shot in the neck did she lose her strength and ability from this shot or did she in fact have no reaction it seemed as if she was weaker directly after that but hard to say in the end.,1295740800,,918,3.994565217391304
4270917,4,B0046MOVD0,"RE:Afterlife...
First off I would have to let everyone know before buying this that in this chapter of the series it does have its ups and downs.
For example this movie starts off really Matrix-like with Alice taking revenge against Umbrella in Tokyo...no zombies,no mutations,just kicking Umbrella ass.
Then the movie drags you to see how Alice loses her powers because of Wesker's sneakiness(no powers?really?).
Afterwards,the film takes you to ""Arcadia"",Alaska where Alice searches for her comrades from the last film to find Claire Redfield at her throat but only for a moment which IMO should've been a duel.
Then you get to L.A.,California to find other survivors in a prison,one including Claire's brother Chris Redfield played by Wentworth Miller from Prison Break. Ironic?Yes.
But the main reason to watch this movie is for the final bout between Alice,Claire and Chris against the reborn Super Wesker while ""The Outsider[Apocalypse Mix]"" by A Perfect Circle is playing although it is not as great as the game but the music pumps you up to watch it over and over again(me specifically for being a APC fan).
All in all,the movie does drag on alot of the time more than any of the films before it but being a fan of the series game and movie-wise i gave it 4 stars for the effort.
Oh yeah don't take out the movie after the credits start rolling because you sorta get a sneak peek of what's to come from the next movie. Gamers won't be suprised but people who only watch the movies will if they know who ""SHE"" is.",1295654400,,1520,4.7180451127819545

4270921,3,B0046MOVD0,"I've been a fan of the series from the start, way back when the first movie was released.  I can say that this one, the fourth in the series, puts me squarely in the middle on my opinions.

The movie was good in general.  I give it 3 stars for general satistfaction.  If I were rating it on Mila alone, it would be 4 or 5 stars, but I must rate the movie as a whole.

The Pro's:  The story continues the series well and picks up right where it left off.  Alice goes to Umbrella HQ to attack them, just as promised.  The storyline as a whole has good progression and is logical.

The Con's:  Some things seem to be just dropped in as a tribute to the video games or simply as a cliche.  The big axe-wielding zombie from Resident Evil 5 is there for some reason. (???) In RE5, he had a reason for being there.  In Afterlife, it just seems contrived.  Also, this is not really a zombie movie, in my opinion.  There are some sequences where zombies do appear, but a vast majority of the movie isn't about zombies.  It's more about Alice vs. Umbrella.

Anyhow, I was generally satisfied, and I didn't demand a refund on my movie ticket; however, the others in the series were better to me.",1295395200,2,1184,4.195555555555556

2) The 3D is perfect! I didn't experience any ghosting at all , the image was crisp and vibrant I am going to watch it again this weekend
3) The audio was superb

This turned out to be my favorite RE movie yet

If your an action or RE fan then just buy it I am sure  you will enjoy it and if you have a 3D TV you HAVE to add it to your collection now!",1295308800,,507,3.675925925925926
4270923,5,B0046MOVD0,"Maybe it's me but I can't get enough of this series. I know, I know....how many times can Alice (AKA Milla Jovovich) come back to stop the dastardly corporation known as Umbrella, which started the whole Zombie mess in the first place? And maybe it was just me, but I thought that this was the best one by far. Why....well, let me start with a brief synopsis of the movie.

Alice tries to stop the leader of Umbrella (Wesler) by attacking him with several of her clones. After a showdown or all showdowns, it appears that she has been made human again (stripped of her supernatural powers) and she travels to what she thinks is salvation only to find a ""mind altered"" Claire who remembers nothing since they separated in the last movie. Following the clues where they go, they find a group of survivors who are living in an abandoned prison. Ironically, in the basement of the facility, in a cage, is Claire's brother who claims to know a way out of the prison.  Of course it is not long before the mindless, yet ever hungry Zombies find a way into the facility and the survivors  are running for their lives. Who will survive and who won't? That's for you to watch the movie and find out.

What I liked about Resident Evil? Well, there  were new characters, among them the sexy Wentworth Miller (Claire's brother)  and Boris Kojoe (Luther West, an athlete). Maybe they were not new, but for someone who knows nothing about the video game or the story line that evolved from it, I was happy to see some newly introduced central characters. I also thought that they were brilliantly cast in their roles and  brought an authenticity to their roles that I was surprised to see. I even liked the guy who played Wesler and thought that he brought a ruthlessness to the part that some may not have. There was even a gigantic executioner who appeared in the middle of the movie that was determined to kill them. He was awesome. And finally, there were wonderful special effects and several fight scenes that made the movie exciting and suspenseful at the same time. Not to mention  a cliffhanger that will send lovers of the series to the movies in droves if there is another sequel. Whatever the formula, the creators of Resident Evil still have that winning formula that made the mindless Zombies theme work.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it!",1294963200,4,2341,4.58133971291866
4270924,3,B0046MOVD0,"Reviewing RE Afterlife is actually pretty complicated; its a lot of highs and lows and ""how does this compare"" type of feelings.  Personally I really enjoy all the RE movies, I know they aren't cinematic masterpieces, but they have all entertained me time and again.  That being said, I think this movie was a low point in the series.  I guess I should clarify and say I did not get to see this in 3D, I missed it in theaters and rented this week and watched it on Bluray.  I know for a fact this movie would have been better in 3D, the only thing is that is part of what I don't like about the movie.  Watching it in 2D makes it clear that about 80% of the movie was nothing more than an excuse to show off their 3D imagination and camera.  Too much of the movie you could tell was storyboarded simply because it would look good in 3D.  This to me is the culmination of the direct the movies have gone.  The first one was definitely a horror movie with action in it.  RE Afterlife was just an action movie.  If you like that, then ok good, Im glad you enjoyed it.  This movie mostly consisted of Action / Action in Slow-mo / Action in 3D / and Action in Slow-mo 3D.  I know all movies like this have ""expendables"", but they didn't even really introduce you to any of the expendables in this movie.  By the time they started getting killed off I thought ""Oh, were that far along in the movie already?"".  Not to mention the deaths were totally random, almost as if saying ""Its the formula, we have to start out with more people than we can end with, so we have to kill some off now"".  It also was a bit annoying how they set up the first 15 - 20 minutes writing a scene to say ""Oops.. We made Alice too powerful, and definitely made a mistake giving her clones.. So we have to do something to make an excuse to take all that away"".  Kinda like in video games where they start you out super powerful, and then make some excuse to take it all away from you right away.  Also there is like all of 3 zombie attacks in the movie.

I did like how they tied even more into the video games.  Chris Redfield shows up, the zombies now have the split face thing from RE5 and they bring in the huge nearly impossible to kill guy with a huge hammer.  There is a tie-in between the bad guy in this movie and in RE5.  The ending sets up the next movie, even though its kinda laughable if you think about it.  That being said I would do it again if I hadnt seen it.  I just feel that 3D should add to a movie, not be the reason for it.  I guess an example of that feeling is Avatar.  Avatar was a great movie in 2D that was even better in 3D.  This movie would have been decent in 3D, but fell short in 2D

So in the end I think I will have to rate the movie like this:

+1 star for being a RE movie
-1 star for filming so much of the movie to only be relevant in 3D
+2 star movie if it had nothing to do with Resident Evil or 3D
+1 because Im feeling generous to the movie",1294963200,2,2956,3.9897785349233392

4270930,3,B0046MOVD0,"Hmmm well, being a fan of the games, the genre, and this series, I will say I was satisfied but somewhat disappointed as well. Unlike the first one, where while attempting to follow the video game series, they added in a story line that fit in the elements of the game, this one added in elements of Resident Evil 5 (the video game) with no explanation as to how they fit in the storyline. The zombies with tenticales coming out of their mouths and the dogs whose heads split in half are based on a different virius whose orgins were not explored in this movie. The movie also adds in the characters Jill Valentine (not sure if this was the same actress from the second movie) and Chris Redfield with no backstory as to their involvment. Another item that someone who gave a worse rating pointed out, Wesker injected Alice with a serum that removed the virus that gave her the superhuman strength and agility, yet she doesn't seem rid of these elements at all during the movie.

But overall those were the only real problems I had with the film. I did like it better than 2 and 3 which were too over the top with superhuman alice, especially #2. Although I did enjoy Mike Epps' light humor to the movie which was destroyed buy the over-the-top antics (can you tell how much I hated the wire-fu that was used). #3 was hardly memorable which is why I won't make any comparisons. While this was not as good as #1, I was generaly entertained by the setting (prison) and most of the story so much so that I didn't realize how little it focused on the zombies or had them on screen. Probably a similar budget cutting technique as the one used in #2 (remember the out of focus shots of zombies).

So in summary, not a bad movie with a decent run time.  Worth the money and looks great in Blu-ray. You can keep that 3D stuff, I already wear glasses to watch TV.",1294617600,2,1853,4.3497109826589595
4270931,3,B0046MOVD0,"I remember way back in 2002 when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil/dp/B000XJ5TOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil</a>&nbsp;came out how skeptical I was about a video game transfer to the big screen. But you gotta hand it to Writer/Director Paul Anderson on that one; he made a great, Action/Horror film.

Then along came&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil-Apocalypse/dp/B000EZ7ZZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil: Apocalypse</a>&nbsp;(RE2) in 2004. Anderson wrote the script, but turned the directing reins over to noob Alexander Witt...and you saw Witt's inexperience all over the movie. RE2 added an amateurish hokeyness that wasn't present in the original.

In 2007 the series returned to straight-up Action/Horror with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil-Extinction/dp/B000YPUFA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil: Extinction</a>&nbsp;(RE3). RE3 never got as dark and creepy as RE1, but it was a lot better than RE2. Anderson again wrote the script, but relied on vet Russ Mulcahy (remember the cult 80s hit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highlander/dp/B001AQO3XS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highlander</a>?) to direct. For RE3, Mulcahy went back to a lot of the basics that made the original so good.

Paul Anderson is back in the Writer/Director's chair for Resident Evil Afterlife, and he continues with the straight-up Action/Horror format. There are good old fashioned scares, tons of action and the story never get boring. The acting and action are often clich&eacute; and over the top, but it's all good.

The story is pretty consistent throughout all four movies. The deadly T-Virus is accidentally (or not) released by the Umbrella Corporation, and it's up to Milla Jovovich to save the world from its effects: zombies, unthinkable mutations (man and animal alike) and the psychotic minds of the Umbrella Corp.

What's really cool is that Anderson keeps a lot of the themes in place that originated in the video game series that the movie was adapted from. For example, in Afterlife we see some of the elements recently introduced in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil-5/dp/B0012N94WO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil 5</a>, the most recent addition to the game series. There's Wesker and his modified abilities; there are the new human and animal mutations that spew a reptilian protrusion from their mouth or head to attack; there's ""The Axe Man""; and be sure to watch the closing credits for an introduction to a video game character staple that has been conspicuously absent from the movie series.

It's certainly not necessary to watch all the movies in chronological order to understand what's going on in the individual releases. But if you're into the Action/Horror genre, and you haven't seen the first three, I recommend just starting from the beginning and enjoy the ride. And as of this writing the individual releases in my links above are really cheap on Blu Ray here at Amazon. None in the series have topped the 2002 original, but Afterlife comes the closest.",1294617600,3,3279,6.373873873873874
4270932,2,B0046MOVD0,"Like a zombie, this franchise just won't die. This is the fourth in the live action movie series. It kicks off like the Matrix with characters wearing slick black and sunglasses indoors. The main villain speaks and looks like Agent Smith from the Matrix trilogy. The bulk of the movie seems taken from Alien 3 with the cast of survivors stuck in an abandon prison.

Mila Jovovich is back as Alice (superhuman heroine), Ali Larter is back as Claire (emotionless heroine), and the guy from Prison Break is her brother Chris Redfield. All of your stereotypes are in the cast. Beautiful ninja, girl without a memory, big talking African American, snaky soldier, paranoid jerk, emotionless villain, bland survivor, and so on.

The movie isn't scary; it's an action movie with moments that startle you out of the blue instead of building up suspense. There's atmosphere everywhere, so I give credit to their set makers and director of photography. From dark, torch lit areas, color faded Alaska, gritty, destroyed Los Angeles and sleek polished underground labs; it all looks great. The special effects are good, plenty of computer generated stuff that looks cool.

The first minute kicks off with a zombie attack, but another one isn't seen until 30 minutes later. There's a lot of really dull waiting around through a lot of the movie.  Not suspenseful waiting around, literal waiting around. There are a few video monologs from the heroine that felt like failed attempts to sell desperation. A lot of things feel like a failure, like if they can trust a locked up Chris Redfield. He felt blatantly trustable from the start.

Another huge negative is after the first fifteen minutes of crazy action (stolen straight out of the Matrix lobby scene), Alice catches up to the main villain and well, he doesn't walk away. It felt like a nice ending to the movie (like the atom bomb in Indiana Jones: Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), but then it goes on for another 80 minutes.

The Resident Evil movies use a formula that starts the movie where the last one ended, because the previous movie ends with something interesting to begin. I mention this, because if you didn't see the last movie, you'll be completely lost. I've seen the last movie several times and I was even lost. Alice tries to jog Claire's memory by recapping the last movie. It made me think that if Claire doesn't even remember, why would I?

The two heroines spend this movie searching for two things, a safe haven from the zombie apocalypse and a likeable character from the last movie. Unfortunately aside from a brief 5 second flashback, you don't get to know who the character is, other than her name is K-Mart. Sure it's a clever name, but maybe more movies should have characters sponsored by companies. Like NASCAR.

I can't say this was a disappointment, because I didn't expect much, just some unbelievable and laughable moments. That's exactly what I got.",1294617600,2,2924,4.822355289421158
4270933,4,B0046MOVD0,"First off, this film isn't mind food or anything deeply contemplative.  It always surprises me when professional film critics can't figure this out.  I mean, c'mon, a film titled ""Resident Evil"" will have a certain mechanic about it.  It doesn't exist to be more than what it is billed as---a fun, popcorn pseudo-videogame film specifically aimed at Resident Evil fans, but also wholly accessible for those who are uninitiated and want to jump aboard for the ride.  (Though with that said, the film doesn't give backstories on the primary bad guys.  To a small degree, it does expect you to do some outside homework if you're not familiar with the games but want to know the full story on why Albert Wesker, for instance, is an important character instead of just another Umbrella suit.)  So if you're looking for a deeper meaning behind things, an Oscar winning performance, or want to take it apart to look for the hidden ""zeitgeist"" you'll be disappointed.  But if you're looking for a solid survival horror with many surprising layers, then this film might be for you.

For me, what struck me immediately was an evolution and an almost restarting of the mythology.  Many conventions in-fiction were reconstructed and removed in order for the characters to grow, but surprisingly, there were also changes made in-reality that added a whole new depth to this film.

There is layered duality present here that is uncanny.  (Outside of the obvious comparison between 2D and 3D.)  On one hand we have the standard zombie/monster action/horror scenes.  But on the other hand, we have very striking contrasts that almost seems like a indie arthouse film versus a more mainstream production, as well as a battling aesthetic match between the modern and the vintage.

For example, in the beginning we have a closeup of rain falling on a very nice pair of legs that looks like it's from a high-fashion hosiery or shoe commercial, but then seconds later we have a brutal zombie attack.  And this conceit continues throughout the film: While there are cluttered city blocks filled with ragged and filthy undead, we also have beautiful and pristine panoramic views gliding over expansive Alaskan landscapes.  While we have ultra-modern weapons like .50 caliber sniper rifles, automatic pistols, and assault rifles, we also have revolvers, antiquated shotguns, and katana blades.  While we have cutting edge computers and thermobaric plasma implosion bombs, we also have torches and an almost medieval siege on a prison that looks like a castle.  We even have some characters with vintage styled clothes flying vintage prop aircraft, yet we also have characters with very modern and synthetic combat suits flying Very Near Future looking tilt-rotor aircraft.

It's a very strange mixture, and almost oxymoronic in the contrast.  But somehow Paul W.S. Anderson and his creative team pulls it off.

What's great about this world is, it's extremely developed.  Although it is self-contained and removed from the regular Resident Evil game canon, it never-the-less has created its own credible ""tangent reality"" that has evolved from a meme of the microcosm, to the entirety of a parallel universe that's very well realized.  So much so, in fact, that it has formed its own unique mythology that is just as strong as the core material it's based on.  This film reinvents itself, and it takes us to a whole new level.  That's unusually rare in franchise-based films, especially videogame ones.  It is also a rarity that these films keep getting better and better with each new offering.  I think a great deal of this, is due to the characters.

Casting and characterization were well executed, both in the principle cast and the proverbial cannon fodder.

As for the ""guest stars"", Kim Coates' character was written a little cliched as the 'Jerk Survivor', but he played his role admirably.  It also worked for me on a personal level, because an acquaintance of mine acts in the same egotistical, self-important style, even though he's perhaps the most unimportant person in my social group.  Boris Kodjoe plays a great warrior/survivor, and Kacey Barnfield, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Fulvio Cecerem, and Norman Yeung are also competent in their roles.  Yeung's character; Kim Yong, is one of the weaker developed character, but at least it gives us an Asian character on screen; which represents my racial grouping, so that was nice on a personal level.

As for the principle cast, with the exception of Wesker, all the prior established characters have the same actors back to reprise their roles.  Once again Ali Later nails her Claire Redfield persona by having a greater (and more physical) role this time around, and Wentworth Miller plays a worthy Chris Redfield.  Even Spencer Locke reprises her role as K-Mart, though she has very little screen time.  As stated, the only real change-up was Shawn Roberts replacing Jason O'Mara as Wesker.  Normally I dislike this as it breaches continuity, but here it was a vast improvement because Roberts channels Wesker perfectly.  (That, and Wesker's role in 'Extinction' was very minor compared to 'Afterlife', so this change can be overlooked.)

Of course, I can't forget about the star of the film, beautiful Milla.  Milla is a cat in human form.  She is sleek, lithe, and her movements are very precise and very predatory.  But this time around, we get a new take on Alice that's both refreshing and rewarding.  Gone are her ""superpowers"", so in her unguarded moments alone, we can almost sense a rebirth of innocence mixed in with a newfound vulnerability.  No, she doesn't lose her combat prowess, fighting skills, or bravado (when with companions), she just loses all the extra enhancements that made her more a superhero X-Man, less a realistic [highly skilled] outbreak survivor.  But now that she's reset back to her ""normal"" self, she doesn't have the advantage of speed, psionics, or fast healing she once had, so the dangers around her become more credible and threatening.

Speaking of threatening, this time our monsters and villains are pulled from the excellent 'Resident Evil 5' game.  The main zombies, dogs, and mutants are the Majini-type (in all facets), but there are also the running themes of self-doubt, isolation, and vulnerability.  So while things are indeed geared towards a monster movie, we also have the innate human-centric condition that reinforces and attacks our characters more-so than any of the prior films.

The production designs be it digital or physical, were great.  Some things that I thought were real (Alice's plane in flight) were CGI, and some things that I thought were CGI (Arcadia freighter) were real---but all in good ways, as it illustrated a successful blending of the tangible and imaginary into a near seamless fabric on screen.

I was also really impressed with the costume design.  Chris' was pretty faithful in terms of his gear and signature blade, and Wesker's and the Executioner Majini's were near dead-on.  But it was Milla's that really sold me.  Walk up to anyone and ask how a corset [and later web gear] worn over a black catsuit; and gray legwarmers under knee-high boots would look, and they'd probably think of some 80's throwback.  But not here.  Milla's outfit was strikingly elegant, and there was a very deliberate and classy vintage feel about her that radiated an almost timeless beauty---especially when we first see her debark from her aircraft and she's dressed in a long gray coat over her outfit.  That, and her slightly shorter haircut compared to her clones, almost looked like she was supposed to be projecting an Amelia Earhart persona.

Moving on, sure, 'Afterlife' had it's flaws.  All films do.  The most glaring one for me, was the reunion of Chris and Claire.  Given the sheer distance between Alaska and California, the two Redfields finding each other was far beyond plausible coincidence and somewhat hokey, but I give it a pass because although the reunion between Claire and Chris in the 'Code Veronica' game was a bit different, at heart it was just as cheesy.  My only other potential gripe, would be how Alice survived the Osprey crash in the very beginning of the film after her T-Virus cells were neutralized.  But that could easily be explained as some mutated cells were still alive when the crash occurred, and they were enough to heal her or keep her alive until they became inert.  There were a couple other minor things, but they aren't worth mentioning...

Overall, you should be able to tell if this film is something you want to buy or not.  After all, no one knows you, the consumer, better than you.  For me, it was very worthy of a purchase, and I articulated why I thought this was the best of the series thus far.  Maybe that will carry some weight in your decision, maybe not.  But for me, it worked on almost all levels, and I was able to suspend my disbelief and have a good time for almost two hours.  If you like cool monsters, constant action and gunplay, post apocalyptic locales, and kick-ass tough guys and beautiful women with guns, then this film should work for you.

Obviously the impressive 3D version would greatly enhance this film, but its translation to 2D works just fine for the casual viewer.

I do have one more thing I'd like to mention.  If you buy the film, watch the credits, as there is a second surprise ending about two minutes into it.

My review ends here, but I do want to mention the ending spoiler because I think it's important.  So stop reading NOW if you are done with the review and don't want to know the second ending.

If you don't mind the SPOILER, continue reading.

Obviously the film ends with a cliffhanger ending, but the second surprise ending with Sienna Guillory reprising her role as Jill Valentine really blew me away.  Out of courtesy, I always watch the credits of movies I see.  Well, when I was in the theater watching the ending credits of this film, I saw Guillory's name, but it confused me because I didn't remember seeing her.  I kept wracking my brain trying to figure out if I missed a flashback scene, but then I simply chalked it up as a mistake on the part of the film---perhaps a flashback that was cut out, but not corrected in the credits.  Well, about a minute later, we see her appearance, and to me, it was fantastic!  Probably the highlight of the movie.  Not only was it great to see her again (I had always wondered why Jill/Sienna wasn't in the last film, and I missd her), but Anderson also kept her current by modeling her after brainwashed ""evil"" Jill from 'Resident Evil 5'.  What was even better, was, the brilliant costume.  Remember when I said the costume designs were great?  Jill's skintight and slinky combat suit was pulled off wonderfully.  The style is a little different from the game, but it's a brilliant translation into real life, and Sienna looks absolutely stunning in it.  Remember when I said Milla was a cat in human form?  So is Sienna, but she's the proverbial bad kitty.  She perfectly pulls of the sex kitten look with the feline walk, posture, and slight smirk as she looks at us, yet she also carries herself in confident manner that exudes the aura and demeanor of a deadly assassin.  She is a perfectly stylized counter to Milla and Ali, and with a set up like this, I'm really looking forward to see what comes next.  Hopefully we won't have to wait too long for the next installment.

4270934,4,B0046MOVD0,"But clearly the set up for the next film.

RESIDENT EVIL:  AFTERLIFE is the fourth installment in the Resident Evil series of zombie flicks, picking up about a year after the end of the last movie.  The earth is still a barren waste land, the unaffected population is becoming smaller and smaller, and to make matters worse, the zombies are mutating, becoming even more deadly.  Alice has struck out on her own and is still searching for vestiges of untainted humans.  The ever-present, all-invasive, and insidiously evil Umbrella Corporation is still after Alice, her powers are still a threat to them, and she is the one remaining force that might still bring them down and save humanity.

While the storylines are getting predictable, RESIDENT EVIL:  AFTERLIFE is still a monster-bashing, gore-filled zombie flick which has enough surprises to keep its audience interested.  The special effects are amazing, and the Resident Evil franchise can still boast that they have the coolest decapitations on record.  And RESIDENT EVIL:  AFTERLIFE clearly ups the ante in this area, bringing decapitations to even new heights.  (There's a sentence I never thought I would think, let alone write!)  Additionally, there is more slo-mo per capita here, than in any movie I've seen to date!  Talk about your Matrix effect!  I can only imagine what RESIDENT EVIL:  AFTERLIFE looked like in 3-D.  It must have been awesome.

As noted above, the ending leaves you hanging, yet clearly signals that the next film is on the way.  If you like good, old fashioned B horror flicks, RESIDENT EVIL:  AFTERLIFE and the rest of the Resident Evil franchise are films for you.  I know that I, personally, am already looking forward to the next flick.  Hopefully, the unanswered questions will finally be resolved.  And if they aren't, I can confidently predict that there will be another totally innovative and completely unique decapitation.",1294531200,4,1918,5.060702875399361
4270935,3,B0046MOVD0,"If you run any movie series long enough, you will run it into the ground. I am a big fan of the first and third films. As a sequel, this movie gets points for picking up where the last one left off, no ""Halloween 3"" here. Milla (Alice) and her newly discovered clones are going to go to Japan and go underground to kill and bunch of uninfected humans still conducting experiments. This would have been a great movie in itself, showing her getting across the Pacific, battling the dead with her superhuman powers. They could have made the third movie all over again, except in Japan with new humans. Alas this is not the movie they did, but instead it all happened in the first few minutes.

The movie starts off with a brief narrative, then uses a few quick flashbacks to catch up any new viewers, or us old guys who forget a lot. The movie seems to have digressed into a ""B"" horror movie as Milla loses her superhuman powers, which was the reason why we watched these things in the first place. Now her lack of powers doesn't prevent her from fighting 13 million dead people in LA. Of course we just don't have dead people anymore. Some have become dead mole people and one guy was a huge orc/troll/Jason creature with super dead-human strength. What was that supposed to be?

The new cast of characters are boring. The special effects were great. The script was very bad for a sequel. I felt raped.",1294444800,,1400,4.422480620155039
4270936,3,B0046MOVD0,"Eight years after the first entry into the Resident Evil film franchise, the series is still a gamer favorite as it goes into its fourth chapter, ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"". For horror franchises, once you pass the second or third installment, most of them begin to falter in some capacity, so how long before this critic-proof, zombie series outstays its welcome with moviegoers?

""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" is set approximately four years after the initial outbreak upon Raccoon City. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is continuing her crusade to destroy the malevolent Umbrella Corporation. At the same time she is making her way northward to one day join Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) and her band of survivors that headed to a supposed infection-free zone somewhere in Alaska. However, Alice quickly discovers that the safe zone was nothing more than another elaborate ploy by Umbrella. With time and patience running thin, Alice luckily finds and enlists the aid of Claire, her estranged brother Chris (Wentworth Miller), and a few others in one last-ditch effort to save humanity from Umbrella and the undead nightmare that has plagued the world.

Continuing his writing duties, and returning to the director's chair for the first time since the original film, Paul W.S. Anderson may be running out of steam with this series. There are several indicators that lead me to this conclusion.

For starters, several elements within the movie are unapologetically borrowed from other successful films. Granted, this series has taken from many a movie or event along the way, but none so blatant and borderline lazy as those found in this film.

The most obvious sign of laziness lies with the film's primary villain (not the zombies as one may think), but a new genetically enhanced individual controlled by Umbrella. This character is so unoriginal that he appears to have been plucked directly from the mold of the Agents used for ""The Matrix"". From his speech pattern, movements, fighting style, and attire (right down to the sunglasses), everything about the character screams ""Rip-off!"" I know movies borrow from previous releases all the time, it's impossible not to; however, when it reaches a point that plays more like plagiarism rather than homage, then it's downright shameful.

Also, the energy and excitement that used to permeate this series seems to have been erased from existence, much like most of humanity. The franchise first began showing signs of a much slower, somewhat meandering pace with the previous installment. It appears that Paul W.S. Anderson was unable to shake this potential problem, and with this newest chapter we are given a film that seems to be just going through the motions with very little momentum propelling it onward.

Then there is the issue with the zombies themselves. Because this is a zombie series, it doesn't take too long for the proceedings to become stale. After all, there are only so many ways one can kill a zombie. Not to mention, the majority of the world is infected. Meaning, a way out for humanity seems more and more implausible with each passing entry.

So, my question is this, ""When is enough ""Enough!""? Maybe we've already reached that point with the previous film and this one is merely another attempt at delaying the inevitable? Based on the story issues I addressed here and others potentially on the horizon, if this series' issues are not rectified, I would say that it has gone on long enough. I figure it's maybe one more movie away from becoming just another horror franchise past its prime that doesn't know when to quit.

An area that up to now hadn't grown quite as stale, but was definitely showing signs of wear, is the visual effects work. The first film suffered a little from moments of sub-par CGI, but the previous two installments made definite improvements in this area, despite the continually lacking financial support from the studio. Yet with this entry the visuals seemed to take a step back as some shoddy CGI work was employed. Some of the visuals were mediocre to the point of being as pathetic in some instances as they were in the original film.

Now, there are two possible causes for this waning visuals issue, and both may be correct, but I leave that for you to decide. First, Paul W.S. Anderson wrote and directed the first film and this film, and both suffered from lacking visual effects quality. Whereas, he only served as writer for the other two installments and their visuals were noticeably improved.

Second, Paul W.S. Anderson filmed this entry using 3D cameras (which undoubtedly came with a heftier price tag) and was forced to spend more time and effort staging shots accordingly. Of course, while I'm sure the camera technology added a bigger price tag to whatever was allotted for cameras on this film, the time spent crafting scenes could have been far less involved if Anderson had chosen to not be annoying with the use of 3D.

What I'm referring to is this; he went with the ""throw things at the viewer's head"" approach that crappy 3D movies in the 80's employed. If he had simply done what James Cameron had done with ""Avatar"" by making the 3D non-obtrusive, then perhaps more of the budget could have gone towards CGI effects. Plus, the use of 3D will magnify flaws in a movie's CGI (if there are any to be found), so when your budget is insufficient for your effects from the get-go, using 3D seems to be a poor decision at that point.

By now you have no doubt noticed that the series as a whole is wearing down, and keeping that theme going is the film's cast. While the performances were decent, there was really nothing new or fresh in this department, and in particular, the two female leads are looking a bit bored with themselves.

Series star Milla Jovovich has been with the franchise since the beginning and has claimed in interviews that she knows Alice inside and out (somewhat paraphrased). Having such a familiarity with a character isn't necessarily a bad thing as it can help keep a performance on track and natural. However, in this instance, I believe that due to Alice being Milla's comfort zone as a character, she is no longer finding any challenge in the role. Therefore, she comes off as uninterested in the character, despite her comments to the contrary, and the performance suffers in the process.

In the other lead role is actress Ali Larter, who joined the franchise in the previous installment and injected new life and eye candy into the proceedings. Yet, just like Milla her performance is beginning to run thin. This is most likely due to the lack of significant character development for her character Claire since the last movie. Ali has proven in previous works that she is a capable actress, but even the most qualified of actor or actress needs a role that will continue to develop and interest them. Otherwise you wind up with the uninspired performances we found here.

Several actors and actresses joined the cast this time around, but the most notable newcomer to the series, at least in name, definitely not in performance, is actor Wentworth Miller (TV's ""Prison Break""). Wentworth portrays the role of Chris Redfield, the long-lost brother of Ali Larter's Claire. His character was poorly handled as he is nothing more than an action hero clich. To be specific, he's the prototypical strong, silent, no-nonsense type. Granted Chris was apparently in the military prior to his current situation we find him in, this based on what little backstory we are granted for the character, but his asinine tough-guy routine felt played out and lame from the get-go.

To sum things up, as I'm sure it's quite obvious at this point, this entry left a lot more to be desired than its predecessors and could easily signal doom for the future of this franchise. If another sequel is to be made, then there needs to be some substantial changes implemented to get the series back on track. Do whatever it takes to bring back the entertainment value this franchise once had in spades. If nothing changes, then the ""Resident Evil"" series will become just another laughing stock in the already long list of horror franchises that outstayed their welcome.

Yes, you know the big weasel is going to outlive most 'good guys' until he receives his final justice. So, no big surprises, and not a lot of sense, either. We know nothing nor care anything for these 'video game' characters (unlike, say, movies like ""Aliens"" or ""Road Warrior""). Instead of creating some difficulty and drama for our heroine, the movie decides that the now ""human"" Alice can still swing from tall buildings, shoot her way out of millions of zombies, and vanquish a 12-foot tall mutant Executioner.

I will have to admit that seeing the latest one, Resident Evil: Afterlife, in 3D on a big screen was absolutely fantastic, but I still enjoyed seeing it on DVD.  It seems Milla Jovich was made for this successful series, which obviously her husband also agrees.

 The beginning scene with a whole group of Alices taking down the Umbrella Corporation has the most action, but there are enough tense moments throughout the film to keep you interested.  Personally, I like the third of this series the best so far, but they are all action packed films that most people have come to expect from the Resident Evil Series. Since I am into edged and other weapons, especially the Gurka and samurai swords, the use of a variety of weapons by Alice makes these films a must see for me.

In all honestly, speaking objectively, I would call it just another action flick. However my attachment to the characters, mixed with my love of well done action films (and this was well done- plenty of original and epic camera shots and slow motion) causes me to label it an excellent movie. Filled with more than enough gore and action, Mila Jovovich is, as always, a spectacular Alice, paired well with Ali Larter and Wentworth Miller. I enjoyed the larger role Claire played in this film, complimenting Alice's 'fighter-girl' persona with her own. While this film did not leave as much room for character development as I would have liked, it gave enough for me to become attached to the new characters, and more so to the old.  My favorite part about this movie however, is that I believe it is the first horror-centered film in which (spoiler) the black guy makes it to the end.

Likewise if you hated them, then there is nothing new in this one that will change your mind.  This movie for the most part suffers like most sequels; the fact they are not as good as the one before.  The same is true with this movie.  I enjoyed it and do not regret buying it, but it does suffer in the fact it was obviously made for 3D and I bought the 2D version.  Don't get me wrong I have enjoyed 3D movies, but this movie seemed to be one Matrix-like bullet time scene after another connected by brief segments of story.  This movie would have been better with a few less of these bullet time scenes and the money spent on authors to develop the characters.  As for suspense, I found there to be very little.  It was all too predictable.  It does setup the inevitable sequel during the closing credits.  Let's hope they spend the money on writers and move closer to the quality of the first and even second one in the series.  For the first time Resident Evil viewer, do yourself a favor and watch them in order, the first one is the best of the series and the second and third weren't bad and then watching this one will be easier to take.

As to my rating, I can't give it 5 stars that would be Gone with the Wind like and this wasn't.  I would give it 3 and a half but that's not a choice.  I gave it 3 because of the poor execution of the Blu-Ray.  At least in my player you had to watch two Sony commercials and then several trailers totaling over 8 minutes.  During this time my player's menu and chapter advance buttons were not operative.  Fortunately I could fast forward, but that still took time.

I don't normally write short, lack of information, reviews but there just isn't any more to say than what has already been said.
Needed to know before watching...Remember how in the last movie, Alice was now really powerfull and it looked like she would have an army of Alice's? The film makers decided, lets have everyone get drugged (yet again) and have their memories erased and this will explain why we are making yet another film. What??!! Wesker hits Alice with a serum to make her human again? But..He can still track her, she still survives a plane crash (just walks away)? When fighting, she still seems to have these abilities but they seemed dulled down. It was just something that bugged me about the plot from the start.

4270950,3,B0046MOVD0,"This is my first movie review, so bare with me.

As a movie, I can probably say that this was a very 'ok' movie, and is worth probably a good-not-solid 4.
But, since this movie seems to primarily be based on Resident Evil 5 the video game, I was only hoping that they would add those nice touches from the game.

I watched this on DVD, not in blu-ray, or at the movie theaters, so I didn't witness the 3D like everyone.
I also don't have a 3D TV with 3D glasses for the blu-ray either, so that's probably also something that took away from the excitement.
When I first rented this (for $1 from the Redbox) I was thinking: Yes! I get to see more of Albert Wesker! Yes! I get to see the Executioner Majini! Yes, Chris Redfield in the movie for the first time! Yes, yes, yes!

But while I was watching the movie, and these characters started appearing, I was more saying no, no, no!! I'll explain.
They have the characters appearance down to a T, but the actors they got to play them are more-than-off.
I have a big problem with the people they cast to play Chris Redfield and Albert Wesker.
Since I'm coming specifically from Resident Evil 5 (As I've never played the previous ones and don't really know how Chris or Wesker looked in their thinner days), I'm expecting the actor that plays Chris to be chiseled and probably a little better looking than who they got to play, which is one of the stars from the show Prison Break: Wentworth Miller ([...])

Now, I started personally liking him as a PERSON, so I started to overlook that they got him to play the part, but it was still a back-thought saying ""I'm settling with less by accepting him to play this part!"" Wentworth is particularly skinny and thin when it comes to this character, even though he has Chris's voice (from Resident Evil 5) down packed, but it also doesn't look right for him to be talking like that. Chris talks a little overly-dramatic, or at least KIND of, and Wentworth did a great job at that, but it didn't look right for him to be talking like that, and also took away from the character and movie.

Next, it's Albert Wesker. Again, coming from the game itself I was expecting the Albert Wesker they cast to be older and more mature.
Personally, it doesn't look right for Wesker to be 'Young,' seeing him on Resident Evil 4, he actually was alot younger looking than 5, but I started liking his matureness on 5. But the person they have playing this character is: Shawn Roberts ([...]). Honestly, he started looking like a Mr. Smith (from Matrix) more than Wesker. Again, I started liking this actor as a person, therefor tried to overlook the character he was playing; but unlike Chris's actor, I just couldn't. Honestly, he is way too young to play this character, and his face is a little fat and it's just not kosher. Really, this was kind of a big deal breaker for me, seeing as Wesker is one of my favorite characters, yet they ruined him so deeply.

As far as everyone else goes, I never played any of the previous Resident Evils before RE4, so I don't know many of the new characters they introduced, like Luther West (Played by Boris Kudjo), if he even IS a character from the video game series.
I just knew Claire from her relationship between Chris (sister/brother). But other than that, I guess they have the right casting; I pretty much just look at the new characters they bring from the game, which I think they never execute properly at all, it's always something big off in regards to the actor playing the characters, even though they can't always be the perfect match, they still can find much better people to play these parts.

But enough about the characters and actors.
The movie itself isn't scary at ALL, much like Resident Evil 5, so they got THAT correct. It's barely even suspenseful.
It's actually pretty boring and slow until the Executioner Majini comes in to play, but in my honest opinion, even that battle was done wrong. Knowing that the Executioner Majini would be in the movie, I was happy to see how well the fight looked against him and the protagonists; but really, for him to be an Executioner the whole battle (if you wanna go as far as to call it ""a battle"") surely wasn't executed right at all.

I don't know if the infected in this movie are Majini or Zombies or what, but they do resemble Majini's how their mouths open up and the things come out, so I'll just call them as both. I liked the way they introduced the Executioner Majini, it was slightly suspenseful and it was like: uh oh! Here it comes! But when they actually fought it, it was cool and everything, but it just wasn't right. You have this big thing, yet it goes down like any other monster with a carefully aimed shot...They tried to shoot it and show that it 'doesn't go down easy,' even with a bullet-to-tha-brain But even that felt like non-sense after a little while.

I know that 'bosses' in movies can't be THAT hard or have THAT long of a battle, as it might make the scene feel repetitive, but to have THAT short of a battle just made it seem like you got ripped off. Again, like I said, this is all because I'm coming from the game itself, to critique these things as just a movie-watcher with no knowledge of the game, then it was just another boss fight done well, I GUESS.

But anyways, also, a problem I had with this is the fact that they call it a zombie movie, yet there really aren't that many zombies.
It seems like they just show a giant horde of zombies on the other side of the barricades to make it seem like uh oh we have to fight all these zombies! But no, really, they only have 2 if not 3 zombie encounters the whole movie. And really, besides the Executioner Majini, they didn't have any new monsters or anything that would make you say ""What's THAT?""

The whole movie is basically filled with talking and walking, and while there might be enough action scenes, they aren't such a big impact that would make me say, this is too much action! Which is a bad thing, because none of the scenes were overwhelming, and in a good action movie, there has to be AT LEAST a FEW overwhelming things, to accompany the boring walking and talking scenes that come after it, but no, it was just 'ok' action.

Really, I'm not saying that boring walking and talking is actually boring, because it was actually pretty ok, but still, for it to be so much of this, with less-than-stellar action, it kind of makes the whole movie kind of boring, but still good.
Like the title says, this is a review from someone who played the games, and is disappointed with the way they implemented things, and is also disappointed with a few of the actors they cast to play such huge roles of Chris Redifield and Albert Wesker, a few of the main hearts of the series. And if I had to rate this movie specifically in ways of a Game-to-Movie transaction, then I would rate it probably a 2, because of the disappointment.

But when it comes to a movie itself, I could probably give it a 4, but you have to understand that this IS a game adaptation, if not directly. But it does come from the video game series, and they should have better thought-out the casting a lot better, and added a little more action AND horror/suspense to it. I loved the first Resident Evil movie, because it was scary in the dank underground subway or wherever, but I hate the fact that people can say ""Fear in daylight"" and just expect it to be scary...No, there can't be scary movies or games in the daylight, not unless it's filled with deep suspense as well.

It may seem like I'm reviewing a Resident Evil game right now, but I just can't help it because I'm a fan of the game(s) and I just wanted to get into some good Resident Evil action. I was hoping, really hoping, that this movie was bring back the scary-feeling that Resident Evil: Extinction, and to a lesser extent, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, was missing.

The game elements they implemented into the movie, honestly took big chunks out of the movie itself, seeing as how much they, to me, failed in all aspects of the new things added into the movie.

In the beginning of the movie you might be thinking: what? I hope the whole movie isn't like this. But it changes.
So, watching this as just a movie-goer with no experience of the game, it might be really boring.
I know that I gave this a 3, and possibly a 4, even though I'm talking rather harshly of the movie, but I guess at most it was a pretty alright movie; but like I said, the characters they inserted into this movie (mostly Chris and Wesker) failed in all aspects of the character, beside Wentworth's spot on voice. They can't put ANYone in a black leather coat, black shades, red eyes, and
slicked-back hair and call them WESKER...No...no way.

I give this a 3, and it's worth a watch. It may not be worth a buy though, if you're collecting these Resident Evil movies, then the most I would say is that it will just be part of the collection, most likely nothing else. This is the worst of all the other 3 Resident Evil movies for me. I hoped this helped.",1293926400,2,9041,4.404191616766467
4270951,5,B0046MOVD0,This movie was great in 3-D at the theater and even better at a party held at my house for a bunch of friends.  Don't miss the clip buried in the credits!,1293840000,2,154,3.8125
4270952,2,B0046MOVD0,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I am a huge fan of the first film. Since then I have been muscling my way through each new installment. So if you are a die-hard fan of every installment, just pass this review up. If you feel the same way I do, then give it a go.

The problem I have with this franchise is the recycling of the same plotline, story, characters, etc. Each movie has Alice stumbling upon a ragtag group of survivors which normally include a bad-ass chick, a smart-ass, someone from the military, and a comic relief. Alice and the survivors she found in that given installment then proceed through a series of pointless plot points until almost all of the survivors are dead. Then there is a big final battle scene which usually includes some sort of self-sacrifice by someone and the movie ends with a cliff hanger. Take a look back at the last three sequels...if I'm off base at all, let me know.

Since all of the sequels are essentially duplicating their predecessors, nothing ever gets added to this franchise. I honestly don't feel like I know any more about Umbrella than I did from when the first film came out. All I know about Umbrella is that their employees like dark sunglasses and they really like building giant structures underground.

I had high hopes for this one considering the director of the first film was back in charge. But if anything, this is possibly the crappiest installment to date. The storyline is even more redundant (if possible), the acting is even more cheesier (if possible), and the characters are even more cliche (if possible.)

 If you have a 3D tv, I'm betting the 3D version is a bit more watchable as the film is inundated with ""in your face"" action sequences. If you don't get the 3D version, there is probably little point in buying this movie unless you are a hardcore fan of the franchise.",1293840000,2,1865,4.555223880597015

Just wish it was in 3D on the regular Blu-ray.",1293840000,2,288,4.377358490566038
4270954,1,B0046MOVD0,"I just don't understand how anyone can be pleased, much less enthusiastic about this movie.

Garbage...

And yes I am a fan of the game series.  It seems the biggest problem is the focus on 3D.  Or more accurately stereo...  Every shot, every aspect of this film was engineered to take advantage of stereo effects.  The characters motions seem robotic and cinematography is gratuitous and without purpose.

This is an example of what is wrong with stereo.  It can be used well and in a way that elevates the experience. This has shown with Coraline, Avatar, How To Train Your Dragon, and many others.  Problem is there is nothing here to elevate.  It's just a whole bunch of stereo demo vids strung together and called a movie...

It's unfortunate because this whole series could have been much more.",1293840000,,800,4.72463768115942

I loved all the action and characters. I liked alice, clair and chris redfield as well the people who portrayed them. The zombies and dogs were cool with there new transformations. Albert Wesker was very cool to. This film takes many ideas from Resident Evil 5 but it's every fun and cool to watch.",1293840000,6,649,4.158730158730159
4270956,1,B0046MOVD0,"I played some of the games, I watched every other movie.  I anticipated this release and was sooo excited when my boyfriend rented it.  I am really, really disappointed.  I did not watch it in 3D, but it would make sense with the matrix style of so many of the fights taking great care to show you every bullet.  I can forgive the makers of the movie that.

What I cannot forgive...
*the absolute lack of storyline.  There is nothing moving this along except the desire to not be eaten and figure out if anyone is on a ship that has given no transmission for 3 days, with no movement visible at all, every time they check.  And they check often.
*The people you like, for the most part, die.  The people that get on your nerves--won't die fast enough.
*There's a big nasty ""experiment"" but you have -no- idea how it came to be.  Just randomly in there with a bunch of mindless zombie types.  A few lucky zombies got to be smart and light a fire under this movies butt so they do something besides sit.
*The end of the movie.. ugh.  I won't spoil it except saying it's really, really bad, and if they make another one I won't even rent it to see if it's worse than this one.
*The entire storyline of the movie could have been avoided if she didn't land the damn plane.  sad.

What was good...
* um.... they tried?  maybe.. I think.

I would go into detail, but I don't want to spoil it for someone that might actually enjoy it.  Sort of difficult to describe  particular examples without giving the movie away.  I'm really glad I didn't buy it.  I can appretiate loyal fans.  The first couple were really great and I truly enjoyed them, and remain a fan--But if I had seen this movie before production I would have groaned and told them to scrap it.

The first movie was pretty good. I bought that one and the next two. But these have gotten progressively worse and this one is just flat out bad. This is a 3D movie and you could see scenes where the story was set up so that some 3D action would happen, but in reality, things would have proceeded just as well if they hadn't tried to set up the 3D shot. Well, the whole movie is like that from a plot standpoint. So many things could have been dropped and no one would ever know they were gone. Primarily because you're generally wondering ""Where'd that come from?""",1293753600,2,748,4.304964539007092

Graphics are a little better and I get to watch it on my 13 foot dvd screen so that is cool, but there is nothing really new with this one.  Still worth a watch I guess.

Edit:
I'm writing this edit after I saw the end.  The end was pretty good, just like in the other movies.  Again, it hints that there's gonna be a sequel to this one.  I am kind of suprised that they made this many Resident Evil movies.  I know they made a ton of the games, but I didn't think the movies were as popular as the games.  Nonetheless, I still think the Trilogy shines way more than this movie does.  I think this one was cool because it was in 3-d and it would have been really scary to watch some of the parts in 3-d as you know which parts they were.  Either way the movie is evil like the other ones.  I still like the Trilogy best.",1293753600,3,946,4.0
4270959,5,B0046MOVD0,"Yes, Paul W Anderson, the director of Resident Evil Afterlife 3D, used the same Fusion 3D camera set up as Avatar, evidenced by the film credits and 3D featurette on the 3D Blu Ray, which also plays standard 2D. The 3D as a result, looks excellent and better than most 3D films out there, excluding Imax's Studio Nature productions. From the opening to the end, everything pops out far greater than you might have seen. The rain in RE:A3D looks spectacular and the depth really shines as though you're ""in the movie"". This is what 3DHDTV was made for. If you miss this and own a 3DTV, your loss if you like action movies.

The movie has elements of the Matrix's fight scenes and slow motion, with The Walking Dead's zombie infested city. The film covers Alaska, Tokyo and Los Angeles. The opening action scene is a highlight and really slick, packed with blazing machine guns and acrobatics. There's also a Axe man scene worth buying this disc for alone, and a cool but short end fight scene with RE5's Albert Wesker. The story is a basic ""escape plan"" movie, but in the RE style. This is the best one so far IMO.

The featurettes are 47 minutes total, and informative, including cast interviews. There's also a screen in screen presentation, director commentary track, deleted and extended scenes and more.

Overall, if you own or eventually plan to buy a 3DHDTV, buy this version for a few extra bucks, as it plays in regular 2D on regular HDTV's and players and looks great in 2D, but exceptional in 3D.

4270962,5,B0046MOVD0,"To begin, movies based on video games will never be as good as the video games, they are homage to a great franchise, but Resident Evil has done the best I think. Also to be noted, many thought that there were many things not explained or didn't make sense in this film installment. However, it MUST be known that in this particular movie, elements are ripped straight out of the game, mostly from Resident Evil 5. If you have played Resident Evil 5, this movie was made for you. RE5 is where the Executioner came from, Las Plagas (the new zombies), the device found stuck to Claire, Wesker's guard dogs that split in half, and his super powers, all the way down to his outfit, some of his dialogue and action moves: ALL from RE5. The way he tosses around Chris and Claire during the ending fight is the same as the game too. If you have not played RE5, Afterlife may seem confusing or random. The climactic scene with fighting Wesker could have been longer, but was still done fairly well. This movie was more directed toward the diehard fans (like me) I think, which is why those of us who have played the game don't need anything explained. We know Chris (well portrayed by Wentworth Miller) and we know Claire, and we definitely know Wesker. We know all about Las Plagas and how deadly that Executioner's axe can be. If anything, this movie should make you want to play the games. There will definitely be a fifth movie (judging by the end of Afterlife) and I am excited because all diehard fans should be. Perhaps the moviemakers decided to cater more to the long-time fans this time, and I shout out a big thank you to that! :)",1293580800,3,1633,4.446666666666666

4270964,4,B0046MOVD0,"When we last saw the character of Alice (Milla Jovovich) in the third RESIDENT EVIL movie, she was about to take on a zombie horde again as her friends left for a new world, a new chance somewhere in Alaska. A signal was being broadcast from ""Arcadia"" promising hope and safety. Alice was giving them the chance to make it there.

The latest edition, RESIDENT EVIL:AFTERLIFE, opens with an army of Alice clones taking on the Umbrella Corporation in their Tokyo facility. Filled with blood and mayhem, the Alices wipe out the initial army sent to stop her, working their way to the head man. A confrontation in a plane as he destroys Tokyo with a massive bomb leads to their crashing but with Alice, of course, walking away.

Six months later Alice is flying to Arcadia in search of her friends. She arrives to find a graveyard of airplanes and Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) disheveled, crazy and wearing a controlling device on her chest. Subdued, Alice tries to find out what happened but Claire is suffering a loss of memory. Together they fly to Hollywood where they find a group of survivors trapped in a prison and surrounded by zombies.

Landing the plane on the roof, Alice and Claire are introduced to these survivors who have been hearing the radio broadcast for Arcadia, except that it's not a town at all. Using binoculars they found that Arcadia was a ship and it's now sitting in the harbor. The only problem is they have to find there way there and Alice's airplane only holds two people.

Deep in the cellar of the prison is a special prisoner still locked away. This turns out to be Chris Redfield (in an ironic twist of casting played by Wentworth Miller, start of PRISONBREAK). Fortunately for these survivors, Chris knows a way out. Unfortunately at the same time the zombies have found a way to tunnel in to the prison and begin attacking. Topside a massive zombie with a giant hammer is attacking as well, breaking down the main entrance.

Much of this is taken directly from the game the film is based on. The suspense isn't developed in wondering how they'll get out but if they'll get out. You also know from the start that not everyone will survive. Characters in these films tend to become fodder for the zombies to assist others in surviving. It's just a question of who will survive and who will become a very unhappy meal.

The action is high level mingled with plot revelations and a storyline that moves the plot forward. It's not a plot on par with the most involved spy thriller, but it does hold your interest and moves the film along. The problem is these films have a tendency to move forward only to set up the next one. Sony has realized they have a decent franchise here and it's more about that than making a stand alone film.

This movie was made featuring the newest technological gimmick to lure people into theaters again, 3-D, and while it doesn't affect the story you can still tell the scenes made to feature the effects. Guns are pointed at you, ninja stars thrown your way and blood splatters towards the camera. For me the chance to see this in 3-D it wouldn't warrant the extra expense of the ticket.

Granted this is not a set piece for Oscar winning material but the actors here do a great job of making you believe they are the people they are portraying. Movies in this genre have been made featuring some terrible acting (watch nearly any SyFy mega creature film and you'll know what I mean), but the RESIDENT EVIL films have fortunately been blessed with decent actors who make their parts come alive. Well, except for those playing zombies.

Perhaps my only disappointment in this latest film was the number of zombies used. We get great crowd shots of them but little one on one confrontation. And when we do they move so fast we don't see much of them. Seeing as how this film was 3-D one would think fans would love to see the gory make up effects coming out of the screen. With the exception of a nasty rooftop encounter for Alice and one zombie shown bursting through the earth after tunneling, we don't get that.

Bottom line is the movie is fun. It does offer another tale in the series and does it well. It holds your interest from beginning to end and moves the franchise along, ending with (of course) a set up for another sequel.

4270966,4,B0046MOVD0,"This is response to William Merrill's review, if in fact you have played the latest major installment of the Resident Evil game franchise(which would be Resident Evil 5) you would know that the fight between Chris Redfield/Alice/Claire Redfield against Albert Wesker in the movie was based loosely but not too dramatically different from Resident Evil 5's flashback sequence where Chris redfields remembers himself and Jill Valentine fighting Wesker. And in that sequence Wesker fights exactly the same, with Matrix style fast moves in which they slow down the camera to catch all the action and suspense of the fight. SO technically the movie wasn't exactly copying the signature Matrix Bullet-time technique, the game had and the movie took that element for the same purpose. Just to clear that up...onto the review...Resident Evil: Afterlife was an awesome 3D movie experience(for those who were lucky enough to catch the movie in all its 3D format glory)...it was well worth the price of admission to see this movie in 3D...it definitely took the Resident Evil franchise to new heights with its 3D action including fights ane zombies and all that gory jazz...Being an avid fan of Resident Evil games then movies and Zombie movie's in general I truly enjoyed this movie experience(and can't wait for the next installment)..though with all that said, like every sequel, it did have its flaws...mostly just in the flow of the movie...long drawn out flight sequences kept this movie from my 5 star rating but other than that make sure you catch this movie in its 3D format(the way the movie was meant to be released...

After an inital blast of action, with clones of Alice and all, the picture slows down a bit.

The film goes into a cool adventure mode with Alice flying across the US to the city of Los Angeles. Her ultimate goal is to find Arcadia (a safe haven). Eventually they lock down in a prison facility, until the undead realise that they are there and then the action starts again.

Action scenes seem to be borrowed from the Matrix (but who cares, that film started a whole new realm of cinematics):

- Fighting in 'rain' against first zombie boss with an over-sized axe;
- Main boss has an Agent Smith type of feel, dark shades and all, there was also the extensive use of the bullet time effects.
- the 'wire work' isn't too shabby either.

Not a bad action film, with hard driving music to keep the momentum going.",1292544000,,1241,4.526785714285714

I knew after the first 3 movies that there would be justice done to Alice and friends and a well written storyline. But I was really impressed with the 3-D effects which blew me away and changed my mind about the new updated 3-D format. I wanted to go Back in and see it again immediately but had things to do, so I can't wait to receive this and watch it over and over.

How boring would it be to see each of the games (which I have played many times over and still love) played out in a movie? I want new and bigger/better scenarios and situations. It makes it feel like you're in a new video game that you don't have to control. You just sit back and enjoy!

I think the producers/directors/writers did a wonderful job with presenting Chris Redfield in this movie. They incorporated certain things from the RE5 game into this latest movie (such as the mind erasing jem attached to Claire's chest, the large double sided axe swinging villian, and the fact that Jill isn't really dead!).

To me, this is the best RE movie yet and I can't wait for the next one. The movies keep getting better and better. Milla Jovovich also fits the character of Alice very well.",1290902400,2,1092,4.29126213592233

Jesus, the producer have in their hands a very successful franchise and don't even bother to make a decent movie!?  What up with that?
We are all seeing good movies being produced based on comic book heroes so it can be made.
Truth is, I think the producers of RE know that fans of the game are probably going to watch it anyway so they just don't care much if the movie  has a good plot or if it's good at all.",1290643200,3,590,3.9495798319327733
4270973,5,B0046MOVD0,"This is one of those movies where the 3-D was not added in post-production. It showed, too, as the movie progressed and you followed the adventures of Alice and the people she finds. Tuning in this time, the zombies seem to be running more of the world and Umbrella seems to be getting bigger by the moment. alice seems to be on a revenge trip, too, taking it to Umbrella for a bit before turning her attentions elsewhere. Her elsewhere is toward the survivors she sent into the middle of nowhere, hoping they would find something besides death. When she gets there, however, she finds a lot more than she bargained for.

for people that have been following the series, this movie fitsa in well. I've seen a lot of people talk about some of the ideas thrown out here with disdain, but this was a good movie in my eyes. It only has a bit of alice doing the whole Umbrella shooting notions from the commercials, then it tunes into more important ideas. Fans of the games will enjoy some of the people that pop up, too, because they are nice.

As far as the creatures are concerned, the beginning was a little bit devoid of contact. this changes, however, as Alice drifts toward some survivors and finds that they've changed. They personally remind me of RE:4 enemies placed on the screen, showcasing just how horrid something like that can be. a new bigboy joins the field, too, placing his axe in places where people won't like it - in their skulls and other places. Combine that with the effects that seem to go along smoothly and it really is action packed.

If you've followed the series, you really have no reason not to like this movie. Even if one or two of them put you off, perhaps this is your gateway back in. I am not a fan of 3-D in movies, seeing a gimmick in it, but this is one of those rare examples where something like this works. You see things in it that show you what 3-D should be and you have a nice story and the motion of the characters as they keep on keeping on.

STARRING: Milla Jovovich, Ali Larter, Boris Kodjoe, Wentworth Miller, Kim Coates, Shawn Roberts, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Spencer Locke and Sienna Guillory

Review Date: 25 October 2010

Resident Evil: Afterlife is the best Resident Evil yet, by far. Here is a series that has done the complete opposite of most franchises: gotten better with each movie. The first film was at best a disappointment, as it was the farthest thing from the videogame series. But its writer / director, Paul W. S. Anderson, has returned to write and direct this installment, and has redeemed himself quite nicely!

Milla Jovovich is back from her bloody crusade of slaying zombies over the course of the last three films, as Alice. We pick up right where we left off back in 2007, and are treated with yet another refreshing voiceover catching us up to speed on what's happened. When you average two to three years between films, this comes in handy.

At the end of part three, Alice had threatened the evil Umbrella-corporation-Heads that she would be coming for them with a few of her friends. After destroying one of Umbrella's labs, and releasing several experimental clones of herself, this film starts with her doing just that. It's a shotgun blast to the face as far as action is concerned, and we love it.

From there she embarks to a place called Arcadia Alaska where all of her surviving comrades from the last film were headed at its end. However, she becomes keen to the idea that Arcadia Alaska may not exist, and finds only one of them; Claire Redfield (Ali Larter).

Claire has suffered some sort of amnesia and no longer remembers Alice, but Alice scoops her up against her will and takes her along to scout the continent for more survivors. Their search leads them to Los Angeles where they hold up in an old prison, hounded by thousands of hungry zombies eagerly waiting outside its gates.

They meet a few other characters there, most of whom who will serve as zombie lunch, and the rest of the film plays out like an action-packed videogame, which is exactly what we're looking for in a film of this genre. There is no shortage of brutal violence, zombie attacks, and awesome slow motion shoot-out scenes, ripped right out of The Matrix. But by now, what movie with more than one gun hasn't done this?

The film leaves us open for another sequel, but bring it. At this rate, I'm pleased to see what's next. Hopefully Anderson will stick around. He does magic with the camera and wrote some really gruesome material. `Carnage candy', for any horror junkie.",1288828800,5,2708,4.789699570815451
4270976,5,B0046MOVD0,"This could be the best Resident Evil movie of the whole saga so far.  Resident Evil Afterlife is packed with lots of nonstop action and for the first time real scary moments making the saga get into the horror genre, which you could experience in the game, if you have played the games; the first RE movie had some scares but they were absent on Apocalypse and Extinction parts.  I jumped out of my seat a couple of times with some unexpected scary attacks of the undead.  I want more of this... so take notes for the fifth part.  The movie RE Afterlife is very well paced, taking care of the characters development.  And finally Resident Evil was presented in 3D which could have been the best movie presented ever with this technology, the effects were astonishing, there are no words I can use to describe the sensations they produced.  I can hardly wait to get my 3D DVD format on December... Resident Evil Afterlife delivers and for all fans of the game and zombie movies RE Afterlife is Eye Candy!!!",1288656000,5,1005,4.524861878453039

I sat 4 rows from the front (I couldn't get any closer without not seeing the whole screen) and was completely devoured by every creature. What an experience! Note I saw this at another movie theater that did not have the 3D version and I loved it but much prefer the 3D version. I have to say that if you love Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter - you won't be disappointed. They look super hot and kick some serious butt! The two of them team up to defeat a 12 foot tall executioner dude with a massive ax/hammer. K-Mart makes an appearance at the end but doesn't say a word. No matter - there WILL be a Resident Evil 5; I bet she'll speak in that one.

4270979,1,B0046MOVD0,"Or something. I don't know. Something needs to be done. That's two bad Resident Evil movies in a row.

There's something about these last two Resident Evil movies that are lacking. There's this weird sense of bland, hollowness as you're watching it. Nothing about it engages you, it leaves you feeling like a distant spectator. I was bored out of my mind.

There's just no feeling of purpose or goal. The characters are just wandering from scene to scene, with some vague sense of some nebulous destination in the near future, but it just doesn't feel significant. The relationships between the characters are never fully explored, such as between Chris and Claire Redfield, and you just generally don't care about anything that's going on, you're just ""watching.""

I like the inclusion of Michael Scofield, and his being ""broken out of prison."" Nice nod to the Prison Break series, of which only the first two seasons count, as everything after that are just abominations to mankind in its purest form.",1286668800,7,1003,4.923076923076923
4270980,2,B0046MOVD0,"I think they're starting to use 3D as a clutch to make bad movies like this seem better than what it really is. Like ""oh well just make a crappy movie, but put it in 3D and let the idiots eat it up!""

I watched this and I was bored enough to want to skip to all the action scenes in this movie and just be done with it. So if you were somewhat bored of the older resident evils, then I'd avoid this. Being 3D should barely be enough to consider watching this in the theater, even a rental might be questionable, but worth it cause of the curiosity.

There's really nothing at all new in this installment. It was boring, same o same o action kind of movie. Honestly, I really thought it would be like a war of the clones type of movie considering how the previous one ended. It was a bit at first but was cut short. I really can't find a good reason why this movie was even made since it didn't even give a closing ending and is giving further excuse to make another RE. Lack of action and when there are some action scenes, they're all boring because you've seen it all example would be the matrix-like fight scene. Nothing new that'll make you want to watch this. It's just not worth it in my honest opinion.

I'm also a bit confused on why they call it AFTERLIFE. I have a theory, but so far nothing big to confirm it.

SPOILER ALERT!

The guy also injects her with something that takes away her powers, strengths and speed and ""neutralizes"" the T virus. So how come it doesn't show much through the movie?

The 2nd one uped the action & weirdness very well.

The 3rd one had me very interested from beginning to end.

This one didn't have much except regular zombies for the most part which was disappointing.  The beginning sequence was a neat way to capitolize on the end of the 3rd movie.  I really wish it had ended about 3 minutes before it did.  The cliff-hanger was not needed in my opinion nor do I hope they make another one to resolve it.

It's by far One of the weakest Films of the Year when it comes to the Plot/Story
If you are like myself and grew up on the Resident Evil Games. Don't expect to get any Sort of Payoff
The Film is a Series of Over the top Action Sequences that would have Worked 10yrs. ago
Nothing is Original most Scenes were Ripped off From Matrix and Die Hard
Paul W.S. Anderson is A True Hollywood Hack he's Films tend to Devolve
Somebody is doing some back-room politics  at Sony
The Zombie make-up effects Sucks!
One very good CGI was that Huge Monster Dude with the Ax (From Resident Evil 5) But, in the same breathe Nothing was Explained Regarding this Huge Killing Machine? Much better then the fake Plastic looking Nemesis from R.E. Apocalypse
The Cast is so/so
Milla Jovovich has been Pushed as a Action Hero she's ok (Her Good looks Brought her to the Dance Not her Acting! Meryl Streep she's Not  she's Not even in the League of Uma Thurman!!!
One good Thing she has a Much better Costume Compared to The Dune/Mad Max Outfit she wore in the Previous Film.
Wentworth Miller as Chris Redfield  was Actually the Best Casting (To Bad They introduced A Real R.E. Character 3 Movies to Late!)
Shawn Roberts as Albert Wesker was  just plain BAD casting!  Why he was chosen is Beyond Me  (They should've just got the Dude from the Matrix since at times u think you are watching The Matrix
The Story mixing Plot elements from Code Veronica and R.E. 5
One good idea was The Survivors being held up in a Prison But, that doesn't get used to any degree just a waste of a Good Idea
(There is No Story This Film could run neck and neck with Rob Zombie's Halloween II Nothing adds up you get No Closer or Any type of Payoff by the end)
Except you get the Ultimate Insult A Cliff Hanger Ending
For the Love of God Enough The Resident Evil Series has been Disrespected and Trashed Enough!!!
The 3D as times look very good But, some scenes are over-done
You can have the best Scenes ever but, when you have No Real Story to move the time along it becomes a Form of Torture

I find it Strange that very few People are questioning the After Effects of The New 3D Format
It's Nothing more than a Huge Gimmick along with All the New Re-Makes coming down the pipe
Hollywood has run out of Any Rare and Cutting Edge Ideas so they throw the 3D Gimmick against the wall and it's Stuck for now!?
When the Film was over every Person that walked out were rubbing there eyes including me
I felt like I had Lasik  done for the second time! Had such a Bad Migraine for the rest of the day
Thanks to the second coming 3D is!
Leaving the Theater Blind from the Overkill of 3D I thought to myself Would this Series have been given allot more Respect and Deep Story  if Sony/Screen Gems Stuck with George A. Romero Script?!!?!? I'm sure it wouldn't have been this Much a Cluster F**k.
  Could be cut/edited down to a 7min Music Video and you still get the Over-All Idea  7/10

Plenty of action, plenty of zombies, plenty of ass-kicking scenes.

And hey, the beautiful, talented, and awesome Milla Jovovich is in it.  That should make you happy.  The end of the film leaves room for another sequel, so be ready for one coming in the near future.  I'll be the first one in line at the box office.

That's when the Millas invade the stronghold of Evil Corp, originators of the zombie virus, and reduce the property value quite abruptly. That's also when we meet Wesker, the over-the-top Chief Evil Overlord (CEO) of the mad scientists' club.

Pretty soon, we're down to just one Milla and the movie gets under way. She finds a former co-survivor, whose memory has been scraped down by mysterious drugs - administered by a robotic scarab that seems sure to become a popular fashion accessory. She connects with one of the small bands of uninfected, and sets out in search of a haven promised by a mysterious radio transmission. She mows down zombies, loses colleagues in a classic countdown, mows down more zombies, saves the innocent, mows down more zombies, battles her nemesis, and braces us for yet another sequel. BTW, the nemesis wants to consume her flesh to make him strong, and the manner of superstitious primitives everywhere (with or without lab coats).

The 3D part works well, especially in a few scenes that already had a hefty splatter factor. For whatever it's worth, Milla keeps her clothes on in this one - a pity, since she wears very little very well.

This is a great sequel that is faithful and as great as its original sequels. This is a fast-paced, action-packed ride that will keep you thinking and on the edge of your seat, at the same time. This looks great in 3D.",1284422400,3,3817,5.084529505582137
4270991,2,B0046MOVD0,"""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" proves once again that a good story is hard to come by. Good storytelling is even harder. By saying ""good,"" I only mean ""adequate"" and ""coherent."" Nothing more. I'm only saying just because a film is based on video game doesn't mean it should be written poorly and directed badly.

So Milla Jovovich's Alice has come back. The film is set first in Tokyo, and then in USA. With Claire (Ali Larter) who has lost her memories, Alice looks for ""Arcadia,"" a haven free of undeads. In a former prison building in the zombie-ravaged city of LA, Alice and Clair are greeted by survivors including Luther (Boris Kodjoe) and Chris (Wentworth Miller). Some of the major characters of the series will return (albeit briefly), so do not miss the end credit.

For director Paul W.S. Anderson, all that matters is actions. And the actions of are ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" not particularly great. The opening Shibuya underground battle sequence shows no sign of creativity. It seems he is so intent on shooting scenes using 3-D camera that he forgets everything he is doing has been done before. Things get better as the film goes on, but too late, the film is almost over.

Alice has become such a strong fighter, capable of using any kinds of weapons, that she can apparently survive anything, even a plane crash (though the film never explains how). Whatever happens to her, we no longer care. Her lengthy battles against the big bad corporation Umbrella's Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who looks like Agent Smith (or Terminator), goes on and on ... probably to another sequel.

Those who have seen the film in 3D may find it interesting to watch objects flying at the camera. I don't dislike it, but I prefer more straightforward but effective ways to entertain, like storytelling and characters.",1284422400,2,1813,4.857605177993528
4270992,3,B0046MOVD0,"The Review:

Resident Evil: Afterlife is the fourth installment in the franchise based on the incredibly successful Capcom video game series.  Afterlife is also riding the 3D movie trend that, for good or ill, has taken firm hold of Hollywood.  Using the same Fusion 3D techniques from the film Avatar, Afterlife looks great and is filled with stunts and action set pieces, with the story taking a back seat to the action.  The story, such as it is, suffers a bit because of the waters having been muddied over the course of the first 3 films and several video games.  I'm familiar with the video game source material and the prior films, and have a difficult time explaining the plot without the aid of Wikipedia or IMDB.  Reviewing the film is difficult because any serious attempt to analyze its story makes it apparent that there isn't much of a story to review.  Nonetheless, Resident Evil: Afterlife is a fun action movie set in the increasingly popular zombie apocalypse.  Manage your expectations and you'll find that there is much fun to be had, but don't go looking for the next 28 Days Later or The Descent.

By way of background, Resident Evil is a re-imagining of George A. Romero style of zombie movies, with a liberal dose of late 20th and early 21st century angst added to the mix in the form of an omnipresent, and apparently omnipotent corporation called Umbrella.  Umbrella seems to have more resources than Apple, Microsoft and Black Water put together.  It dabbles in everything, including biological weapons.  In 2002's Resident Evil, one of those bio-weapons, the T-Virus escaped into one of Umbrella's massive research facilities, turning all its personnel into zombies.  Despite her best efforts, our hero, Alice, played by Milla Jovovich, is unable to stop the release of the virus, and over the course of the next two films, Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Resident Evil: Extinction, the T-Virus went world-wide.  Afterlife picks up very soon after the events of 2007's Resident Evil: Extinction, and Alice, or to be more precise, several Alice's, have taken the fight to Umbrella Corporation, which inexplicably, has survived the world-wide zombie outbreak.  Governments have fallen, and small pockets of survivors struggle against the zombie hordes, but the evil of Umbrella is eternal.

Now, Resident Evil: Afterlife has been savaged by mainstream film critics, with a 38 on [...].  And, if judged solely on its story, a mash up of Japanese video game and anime clichs and American action movie making, Afterlife earns its mainstream film critic scorn.  Still I couldn't help but enjoy it as a great action movie held down by a B-move plot.  Afterlife shines when Alice and her ragtag band of survivors are shooting their way out of zombie infested LA prison.  It falters when it makes feeble attempts at characterization, or exposition.  Long lost siblings, amnesiac secondary characters, unexplained giants, supposedly normal human beings able to perform super heroic feats of strength and agility, and paper thin villains capable of predicting everything, except the most obvious things abound in Afterlife.  There doesn't seem to be a motivating force behind any of Umbrella's actions.  Is it trying to run the world?  Newsflash, Umbrella, you're the only entity left standing.  All the Governments are gone, and you're the only thing left with any serious technology or the ability to field any sort of military force.  But, this is kinda the problem with reviewing a film like Resident Evil: Afterlife.  My pondering the motivation of a fictitious corporation's efforts to control a runaway zombie virus is reminiscent of critics who called the movie Blade to the carpet for being unrealistic.  Well, duh!  It's Resident Evil folks.  It's just not the kinda movie that stands up to serious film critique.  What it is though, is dumb, end of summer movie season fun.  Heavy on action, and very weak on story.  I had plenty of fun watching it, but upon reflection, I have to admit that the story is kinda dumb.

That's one way of saying that Resident Evil is a fun, but dumb action franchise designed primarily to deliver a sequel every few years so long as each film returns a high enough profit.  The stunts are great and the action scenes are really helped out by excellent use of 3D effects.  If you want a smart zombie film, then I recommend Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, and Zombie Land.  If you want a great action focused zombie movie that showcases the newest in 3D tech, see Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D.

4270993,1,B0046MOVD0,"Now I like the RE series. So much so that I've played the games and watched the movies multiple times. So I decided to go to the midnight premier of the newest installment in the RE franchise. Upon entering the theater I was met by ecstatic fans. So naturally my excitement rose. About forty minutes later the lights dimmed and we held our breath as the movie began. What we were treated to was unfortunately the worst RE yet. The story picks up right where the third one left off.

*Spoilers* After Alice and her clones take their revenge on the Umbrella facility in Tokyo, Alice makes her way to the fabled sanctuary known as Arcadia. Upon arriving at the supposed location of this safe haven, she discovers Claire Redfield, of course burdened with the classic cliche: amnesia. So she has no way of remembering what happened to the rest of the party that Alice had sent there in RE Extinction. Fearing that they are the last humans, they make their way to Los Angeles. Because that's exactly where you should go during a zombie apocalypse, a LARGE CITY! In LA they find a whole horde of zombies. SHOCKING! There also happens to be a small band of survivors surviving in a prison. Again, SHOCKING! Alice MUST help these people get to Arcadia. Why? Who knows?! Or cares?! The farther along the movie went, the more I realized that I was not one of the few people who did. The movie was nothing more than action sequences tethered together by nothingness. Most of the new characters were completely worthless and only served as fodder for the zombie hordes. Now I know the RE series is not looking for an Oscar but really, a little more effort from the actors and the screenwriters to develop the characters might have made me care a little more. Actually I doubt it. These characters have gotten boring! The action scenes were half decent but even those were ruined. The huge killer? SLOW-MOTION! I wanted to rip my hair out! A great action scene is instantly killed with unnecessary 2min slow-motion. Alice jumps off a building -> slow-motion. Someone throws a gun to Alice -> slow-motion. Claire takes out a zombie boss -> slow-motion. Alice picks her nose -> slow-motion! Totally killed the pacing and excitement. Another major pace killer? The editing! The movie is absolutely filled with useless shots. For instance: more often than not we'll get a birds eye view of the area and Alice's location. Yes, we get it, she's being tracked! A little gripe out of the many shots, but little things like that really accumulate.

Now Afterlife did have a few shining moments. The 3D was actually spectacular! It really helped with the depth of the movie, particularly with the flying scenes and the zombie battles. Was it a gimmick? A big emphatic HELL YES! Everything from knives, bullets, blood, guns, zombies, and giant axes were thrown at the viewer. While it was a bit much at times, it was still awesome! Apart from the 3D, seeing The Executioner made me as giddy as a school girl. He was freaking amazing. Unfortunately, he and the ""new"" zombies are never explained in the movies, which only leads to confusion. While the end of RE Afterlife leaves room for a sequel, ""this"" RE universe in no way deserves another one. The best way to continue the RE movies is IMO by completely rebooting it. Make a Resident Evil movie based on the actual games! Resident Evil Afterlife wasn't just disappointing. No, it was a terrible movie with a predictable plot, stagnant pacing and dull characters.",1284336000,11,3490,4.691680261011419

4270995,3,B0046MOVD0,"I loved the scenery, special effects and the fight scenes but the acting was abysmal. Everyone including Milla Jovovich, delivered their lines like they were reading the instructions off the back of a pregnancy test box. Some parts were unintentionally hilarious and ridiculous as well. Another thing that killed me was that they tried to inject characters from the video game(Chris & Claire Redfield) as if they are trying to be true to the source material. You already hacked up the original plot of the video game so why try to redeem yourselves with this mediocre mess now. All in all, it was decent enough to sit through but not as EPIC as it wants you to believe. If you just have to watch this, go at the matine price or try like hell to get some free passes. 2.5 stars for me but would have been 3 if the acting wasn't so horrid.",1284336000,2,837,4.441558441558442
4270996,4,B0046MOVD0,"What is there to say, in this, the fourth go around for the better-as-a-game-than-a-movie adaptation?  Partially due to my fondness for the now venerable game series and probably also partially due to the fact that Milla Jovovich is, once again, kicking ass and taking names, I tend to have a soft spot in my heart for the Resident Evil series.  Even though none of the sequels ever lived up to the original (which, in and of itself, isn't a terrific movie), I was excited for Afterlife, the fourth movie but also the first since the original to be directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon and a bunch of other lesser films).  I guess, for me, Resident Evil falls into a guilty pleasure corner, wired off and surrounded by other equally bad guilty pleasures (the likes of which I'd tell you about, but then I'd have to kill you).  At any rate, here we are.  Fourth movie in a series that's been chugging along and losing steam.  And I have to say that this is easily the best of the sequels.

Watching the trailers, you never really get a feel for what the story would be, fourth time around.  Instead we're provided with plenty of action shots of items flying at the screen, pronouncements of ""3D!!!"" and ""filmed with the same cameras as Avatar!!"", which, after seeing the movie, is probably because there's not much else to the film.  It opens in Tokyo, at some uncertain time in the future, years after the events of the first film.  The Umbrella Corporation is still churning out bio-experiments which makes me wonder, ""why?"".  If the world is as empty and personless as it seems to be, who are they making them for?  Seeing as how society has collapsed globally, is Umbrella making bioweapons/experimenting on people just to...*finger upturned to lip* be evil?  Isn't that kind of counter-productive?  It's not as if they have control over their creations (the action opens with Umbrella goons shooting at zombies for sport), so why would they keep churning out monsters?  But before you can dwell longer on this question, we have Alice times a hundred mowing down faceless Umbrella goons, blowing up lobbies, diving through glass, turned upwards and shooting in slow motion and basically ripping off every action sequence from The Matrix (which was...what, almost eleven years ago?), except this time it's in 3D.  Oh and there's two Alices diving through glass and falling, whilst shooting, a la Matrix Reloaded; two Millas > one Carrie-Anne Moss.

After blowing the hell out of the Umbrella Tokyo lab and losing her ridiculous psychic/clone powers, Alice is turned back to human (which is probably the only plot point in this film, and a much welcomed one at that), Wesker has vanished and she can return to locating her friends who she last saw flying away to Alaska in a helicopter.  Oh and we have another lapse of time, this time for 6 months.  What has she been doing this whole time?!

Moving on...

Once the film proper begins, we end up in LA and it becomes a similar structure to the first film; protagonists are trapped in a building (this time a more boring prison) and must get out/survive against hordes of undead.  Expendable characters are introduced, only to be dispatched, mostly off-camera.  Oh and to, I guess, further emphasize that this is, yes, based on the game series even though it does not resemble it at all by now, Anderson throws in Chris Redfield.  By this time, we're hurtling toward the ending, which seems to take longer to reach than the running time allows, and are given another cliffhanger-y ended to set up another entry and boom: run credits...oh wait, no.  We have a mid-credits scene, too, so don't take your glasses off.

Which brings me back to the trailers: 3D! James Cameron cameras!  Yes, those are the big bullet points and yes it's the reason to see the film (unless you're like me and secretly harbor a Resident Evil guilty pleasure center).  Say what you will about Paul W.S. Anderson and his directing skills, but the man does know how to stage a shot.  His cinematographer captures some awesome-looking shots.  And the effects are pretty snazzy, even though Anderson hasn't met a Matrix shot/gimmick he doesn't like.  Nothing in this film is even remotely original or as exciting as the films/segments they're based on, but the 3D is probably the best I've seen in a film.  And yes, that includes Avatar.  Every single film that has come out between Avatar and Afterlife has been post-converted to 3D after the filming and it shows.  The scenes pop with life and space in Afterlife and while Anderson uses bullet-time and freeze shots a bit too much, each one looks phenonimal in 3D.  It's pretty fantastically filmed.  He also brings a splashy style to a series that hasn't been filmed very well since the original.  Who knew that the thing Resident Evil was missing was Anderson?

So is Afterlife a good movie?  Oh no.  Not at all.  Why the four stars?  Because I enjoyed myself through pretty much the entire movie and was entertained.  Sure, it kind of drags on a bit and Anderson uses fade to black and fade to white so much that it feels like the movie never truly starts. But I enjoyed it, for what it was, and this is the first time since Avatar where I didn't feel like my $12.50 was wasted on the 3D.  Fans of the series, you should enjoy this entry.  Everyone else?  Well...the 3D's exceptional.",1284336000,,5370,4.689102564102564
4270997,2,B0046MOVD0,"Resident Evil is a movie franchise that is a perfect example of not just falling short, but almost missing the point entirely in comparison to its source material. While playing through the first two games, parts of the third, and owning the fourth (with Resident Evil 4 becoming a personal favorite), the games have always had a pretty solid storyline that always centered around a well developed and genuinely terrifying atmosphere; traits the films seem to completely overlook. Afterlife offers the same generic formula and changes nothing that was used in the three previous films.

Truth be told, zombie cinema seems like it's pretty tapped out. Most zombie films these days revolve around a recycled idea or ideas that have been done at least half a dozen times previously. The Resident Evil films seem to be following the same trend at least as far as offering an entertaining experience is concerned.

What did you think of the slow motion effect that was used in 300? Did you think it was pointless, overused, and overbearing? Well that's nothing in comparison to the slo-mo used in Afterlife. The beginning involving the girl standing in the rain, the plane wreck with Wesker and Alice, and the fight scene in the shower involving Ali Larter are the biggest examples that come to mind. The effect seemed to be used more for when people were in the process of looking up or turning around rather than when they were shooting a zombie in the head (which it's used for at one point and is the only time the effect really felt like it was needed) or something actually worth the trouble of putting into slo-mo.

Logic seemed to be completely thrown out the window, as well. Alice had become human again, but walked away from a plane wreck and flew through the air in fight scenes in ways that would make Neo from The Matrix jealous. Or what about the way she landed her plane on that rooftop? How the survivors kept her plane from falling to the ground below? At times, the film managed to be even more ridiculous and over the top than both The Expendables and Machete.

The few good things about the film seemed to borrow an awful lot from other films and TV shows. The coolest idea in the film is the way Alice uses quarters, but it'll just end up reminding you of Scott Pilgrim. The best fight scene takes place in the shower with Claire and Axeman, but both her and Alice are accomplishing things most humans could only dream of. Afterlife seemed to borrow ideas from the Dawn of the Dead remake (HELP US!), The Boondock Saints (Wesker's ""death""), and even ""Beetleborgs"" (those weird bug things on their chests). Not to mention the fact that EVERYONE had to talk the way Christian Bale talked as Batman in Christopher Nolan's Batman films. The extremely large man who carried the axe was apparently from Resident Evil 5 even though his name was altered a bit in the film. If you haven't played RE5 though, you'll probably draw the comparison between Axeman and Pyramid Head from Silent Hill. Since the film franchise has strayed further and further away from the source material, it just seems odd that they'd replace that with what seems like borrowed ideas from other popular franchises.

Resident Evil: Afterlife is just another tiring sequel to what is another exhausted movie franchise. If it wasn't for the fact that it's not only in 3D but actually filmed in that format, then the whole trip would be pretty pointless in the long run. Despite its impressive visual effects and a decent fight sequence or two, the film is otherwise completely illogical, slow moving in the first half, and overacted. If you're a fan of any of the first three films, then you'll probably love this one. Otherwise skip this worn out sequel to what is seemingly a never ending franchise.",1284249600,4,3783,4.70845921450151

Alice going after Umbrella Corp. Killing some zombies, sporting amazing moves and weaponery...
There was some zombie killing, but it also had more to offer...
Alice's search for the umbrella corps leader was pretty intense and like always there were a few intense fights...

The weaponery was superb... those shotguns(similiar to modernwarfare2 shotguns) were awesome...
Alice had some amazing moves, as well as Claire...

The special effects were very well done... never did the scenes look over the top like in lets say, Die Hard 4 or a movie of that nature...

4271000,2,B0046MOVD0,"I'm trying to be fair here in judging this film after seeing it. I've only ever seen the first one,and it just didn't really do much for me. Perhaps its because I'm not a big video game nerd?making a film based on a video game has got to be harder than making a film based on a novel or a comic book. As for the action,well...there's allot of flexibility in sci-fi and then there's WTF was that?It would probably behoove me to see the other Resident Evil films, but I don't recall them being all that memorible just as this one was. Aside from the fact that Mila Jovavich is hot,I mean...what  woman with a kick ass figure doesn't look good in a a skin tight one-piece while firing guns and  killing everything in sight?Its just that this film is a repeate of all the others,survival of the apocolypse,the evil Umbrella Corporation and killing zombies and trying not to get infected yourself. The action is tiresome,non of it is new or original,and this one reeks of ripping off ""The Matrix"" with its slow motion action sequences combined with ""hanging in dead space"" because she's suppose to be super human. All I can say is,""YYYYYyyyyyaaaaaawwwwwwwwn.""I'm rolling my eyes back in my head wondering when this stupid waste of film is going to be over, but it never seems to be. Just when you think it will be, it sets itself up for yet another pathetic sequel. My god,aren't there enough bad sequels floating around out there alredy?Apparently not. There is nothing memorible about this film. It was loaded with cheap tricks to ""get you to jump"",lots of guns blazing,explosions,blood and guts. It was like watching a Michael Bay knock off,it just flat out sucked and seeing it in 3d wasn't helping. The difference is, you get to see a film in 3d suck for two hours.

4271002,5,B0046MOVD0,"I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil movie series, but I must be honest and say that ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" makes the other installments look like garbage by comparison.
The budget was much higher, and thus allowed for longer, more explosive battles, and a huge number of visuals, which range from Alaska, to Toyko, Los Angeles, inside of a maximum security prison, and on a boat.
The movie opens with a huge scene in the Umbrella facility headquarters, where Alice and her clones proceed to annihilate the entire facility. She literally kills almost everyone, taking down a sort-of hive at least ten times the size of any other in previous films. Albert Wesker escapes though, in a plane with the original Alice, and blows up the entire facility. He injects Alice, making her human again, before they crash. And this only the beginning.
Alice flies in a plane, and eventually reaches Alaska, trying to find ""Arcadia."" There is no one there, just many planes. She is eventually attacked by Claire, who has a mechanical, parastic like device on her chest, and causes her to fight Alice. Alice wins, because she still is very strong even without her special powers from 2-3.
They move on, and head over Los Angeles, where they land the plane and meet up with new survivors, who are living in a maximum security prison. This is where the movie slows down a little, taking time to get Claire back to herself as she is suffering from memory loss, and meeting Chris Redfield. Huge spoiler!: Arcadia is a ship, and they can see it. So it's time to leave, and get there.
Unfortunately the ""Executioner"" shows up, and this is after evolved zombies dig holes and get inside. THey decide to use the tunnels they made as a means to escape, but not before the Executioner shows in the showers. Water shoots everywhere as he takes Claire and Alice on in the best part of the film. And, keep in mind, we are about half-way through at this point.
They get on ""Arcadia,"" which is supposed to be a safe ship for survivors. Unfortunately, it is not. It is a huge trap concocted by Umbrella itelf. On it are 2, 000 prisoners, people they have collected to experiment on. This is a pretty messed up scene, which involves Alice confronting Wesker again. The people are released. This entire scene is very unique looking in that the entire interior is bright white.
What follows is the ultimate battle, with Wesker having two evolved dogs who go at Alice, while Claire and Chris go at Wesker. Cool Matrix style moves ensue (ones that look and feel far better than the movie that came out like ten years ago), in which Wesker is ""supposedly"" taking down. In case anyone wonders, the Perfect Circle song titled ""The Outsider (Apocalypse Mix)"" is used in this scene, as it was in the trailer. They shoot wesker many times, but he still manages to get up and take off. He goes to detonate the boat, but the bomb is planted on his plane, and he explodes, presumed dead.
They seem to have won but...tons of planes like Wesker's show all around. It is obvious Umbrella is planning what may be a huge ""final stand."" And just when you think it cannot get any better, Jill Valentine, with one of the mechanical parasitic devices on her chest, is taking charge, and seems to directly address the audience about a huge battle coming.

Things that must be ackowledged further is the 3-D. Unlike the stupid cheap conversions used in many recent movies, they used the same system James Cameron used for Avatar, the real 3-D system, filmed with it. It is astounding, from the rain, to some simple blood splatters, glass, and the executioners weapons.
Another draw is the excellent score, composed of explosive rock/industrial sound music. I would say it was either up to par, or better than the composed soundtrack for the original, and hundred times better than the scores used for Apocalypse or Extinction.
Also, Chris finally came into the mix. I will now go onto game similarities. A huge draw is the Executioner from RE4, but a lot of movie is composed from Code Veronica, from the prison situation mainly. More is definitely borrowed from ""The Umbrella Chronicles"" as well. In fact, in context to the games, I would say this movie is more faithful than 1 or Extinction (2 being the most faithful which was exactly like 3: Nemesisis in many cases).
Another plus point would be the growing number of heroines, hopefully the likes of Leon Kennedy or Rebecca Marshall will be added next time around.

So, all in all, this was an excellent movie. It outdid the entire franchise, and should easily outgross them as well. Be sure to see it in theatres, as one should not miss an actual, true 3-D experience.",1284163200,4,4671,4.653753026634383

4271004,3,B0046MOVD0,"Time to get in the mud. Director Paul W.S. Anderson - or, as I like to call him, ""Mr. Jovovich"" - lands a bigger budget, and the visual effects flourish accordingly. Someone should've paid the writers, though. The acting? No, there's no acting here. But a lot of zombies get all tore up. If you've come to this flick expecting good acting performances from this cast, prepare to get your feelings hurt. This is cinematic junk food where the scares are few and character arcs break down to either the character's still alive or he's zombie snack. Whenever there's a pause for exposition and the participants try to act, the venture collapses or drags or whichever terms of discontent you want to apply. But, look at it this way, at least the director makes the plot seem unoriginal and muddled. Uh...

Four years after the first outbreak of the T-virus, and the zombie apocalypse has ravaged the planet and reduced the human population down to not a hell of a lot. Whoever said the meek shall inherit the earth needs to get savagely punched in the face, because the world now belongs to the undead and the mutants, and these assclowns are meek in the same way that starving Avon ladies are meek. The story picks up many months after Project: Alice and Claire Redfield went their divergent ways, with Claire and her charges off to Alaska and the elusive promise of haven. Alice - and this all happened at the back end of RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION - discovers clones of herself and she right then and there vows to take the fight directly to the Umbrella Corporation. RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE opens with our girl lviing up to her promise as she raids the massive Umbrella complex in Tokyo. And Project: Alice, she brung her doppelgangers.

So I harbor mad love for this film franchise, even if I'm not as familiar with its video game source - but I know they don't share continuity and that Alice was created specifically for the film adaptations. Milla Jovovich has kind of snuck up on me in that I don't know exactly when it was that she took over from Angelina Jolie as the pre-eminent western film action heroine in my eyes (I say ""western film"" because I feel Michelle Yeoh can still wipe the floor with Jolie and Jovovich). The writers do a clever in this sequel. Over the past series of films, Alice had gradually grown stronger and stronger and had even achieved telekinesis, which to me is just damn unfair for all the beasties out there. This is addressed in this sequel, and so we soon find a depowered Alice who still manages to handle her business with more finality and flair than anyone else.

Somewhere along the way, Alice and Claire Redfield reunite. Claire has suffered memory loss but has gained some wicked action hero moves. In Los Angeles, Alice and Claire run into a few other survivors holing up in a prison facility except that, outside, hordes and hordes of teeming flesh-eaters pound the walls. The survivors - comprised partly of Hollywood actors and a film producer - had hoped that Alice and Claire had arrived to rescue them. Alice lets them down easy... well, the gist of what she says is in effect, ""No, this isn't a rescue operation. Get over it."" At this point, if you already hadn't suspected that the zombies would somehow eventually find a way into the prison fortress, then you are some kind of innocent babe in the woods. For these few survivors, it's not remotely comforting that, off on the horizon, they can glimpse one last hope for safe harbor.

RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE reserves a segment for its little stabs at Hollywood tropes, and of course the film producer would have to be an assclown. Languishing in a cell, one character finally shows up whom I'd been waiting for. If that's not enough of a hint, he's got a personal connection with one of our two heroines.

The action sequences are big and crazy kinetic and live up to what you'd expect from this franchise, and the 3D feature does fun wonky things to your depth perception. The best action bits are the prison breakout and the Alices storming the Tokyo Umbrella headquarters. Alice - except I like calling her ""Project: Alice"" - towers above everyone else in sheer badassery, and if she's cheesed at you, it's best that you don't hand her a pocketful of change. I will say, though, that Alice's showdown with Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), the formidable Umbrella boss, is vastly underwhelming (and, okay, I officially have had it with bullet-time effects). Wesker desperately craves Alice's DNA because, so far, only Alice's genetic code has safely accommodated the T-virus. I also had a problem getting past Roberts' obvious channeling of THE MATRIX's Agent Smith and with his coming back from the dead perhaps too many times. At first, the man's sturdiness is chuckleable, and then the groaning.

Some parting stuff: As far as featured new creatures, I think the monstrous hooded executioner steals the show and the hell hounds exude that ick factor. Not so familiar with the video game source but not entirely ignorant, either, I think it's cool that the Japanese in the film refer to the zombies as ""Biohazards"" (which is what the Resident Evil video games are titled in Japan). Concerning AFTERLIFE, there are bits here lifted from THE MATRIX, DAWN OF THE DEAD and others. It is what it is. Is it wrong that I actually think it's cool the film ends on a cliffhanger - because I want more sequels?  And do I recommend this one? Despite its flaws, I think I do. O where have you gone, my standards?",1284076800,3,5508,4.678018575851393
4271005,3,B0046MOVD0,"When we last left the ""Resident Evil"" universe, the intrepid, superhuman Alice (Milla Jovovich) threatened to band together an army of her own clones and come after the board of the insidious Umbrella Corporation. And so she does at the beginning of ""Resident Evil: Afterlife,"" raiding the vast superstructure that is Umbrella's headquarters buried deep beneath the streets of Tokyo. That such a structure could ever exist under Tokyo - or any city, for that matter - seriously stretches the limits of suspension of disbelief, but never mind. During this raid, we see lots of things flying around the screen in slow motion, including guns, bodies, debris, and fireballs; this, we eventually discover, is a visual technique used all throughout the film. Believe me when I say that this gets old very, very quickly.

This fourth installment of the hugely popular ""Resident Evil"" franchise, based on the video game of the same name, marks Paul W.S. Anderson's debut into the unstoppable world of 3D cinema, a distinction made possible through his friendship with James Cameron and the Fusion Camera System he developed for ""Avatar."" We're talking about some amazing 3D, here. Was there no way to put it to better use? ""Afterlife"" plays less like a thrilling adventure and more like instant replay on steroids, each action scene (and there are a lot of them) slowed to an agonizing pace. Every kick, stab, blow to the head, and airborne weapon seems caught in an inescapable time warp, as if Anderson was literally trying to analyze the smallest details of every shot. On the basis of this film, he would be a good candidate for the host of an after-game sports highlight show.

The plot: Eighteen months after the events of ""Resident Evil: Extinction,"" Alice flies up to Alaska, where a transmission promising a safe haven for the uninfected had been emanating. Already there, she assumes, are a small band of survivors that flew away via helicopter. Upon arriving, she finds absolutely nothing ... except for a now feral Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), who has a strange metal spider-like mechanism affixed to her chest. Claire, you may or may not recall, led the survivors at the end of the previous film. Alice removes the mechanism, only to learn that Claire doesn't remember her, nor does she remember anything else, including her own name. The specifics of this are left a little obscure, although Alice freely speculates that the mechanism had been pumping Claire's body full of an amnesia-inducing drug. I guess she was right; little by little, Claire's memory returns.

The two fly down the western seaboard to the smoldering remains of Los Angeles. They land on the roof of a former maximum security prison, which is now completely surrounded by mutated zombies. Inside, they find a new group of survivors, one of which is an imprisoned military officer named Chris (Wentworth Miller). No adequate reason is given for why he was locked up, save for a few vague references to him having killed people. If you're intimately familiar with the video game series, then you already know something else about Chris. If, like me, you have never played the games and don't plan on playing them anytime soon, then you may actually be surprised by who he turns out to be. In any case, I have a problem with film adaptations that make no effort to explain characters or situations known only to diehard fans. If you can't go into these movies cold and still get something out of them, then you're being unfairly treated.

What, for example, am I to make of the inexplicable appearance of a gigantic hooded brute wielding a makeshift axe twice as big as a normal person? I've since learned from internet research that this character is known as The Executioner, but sitting in the theater, I had no idea who or what he was, nor could I account for how he came to be in Los Angeles. Watching this scene, watching this whole movie, is a little like entering a conversation when it's halfway finished - you're being fed details, but you're missing vital bits of information, including context, intent, and meaning.

All leads up to an inevitable confrontation, which in this case involves Albert Wesker, the chairman of Umbrella. He's played by Shawn Roberts, whose low, monotone voice, stony expression, and dark-suit-and-sunglasses getup suggests he was channeling Hugo Weaving from ""The Matrix."" There's even a point at which he dodges bullets in invisible bursts of speed; when caught in grip of the film's slow motion, we can clearly see the bullets as they whiz past his face, leaving behind a trail of rippled air. Couple that with scenes in an underground cave that play like a cheap imitation of ""The Descent"" and elements from every zombie movie from ""Night of the Living Dead"" to ""28 Days Later"" - this movie doesn't merely exist in a closed fanboy universe, it's also a rip off. ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" will almost certainly not be the last film of the series, but with any luck, it will be the last to be so blissfully unmindful of movie audiences.",1284076800,4,5053,4.86411149825784
4271006,4,B0046MOVD0,"As far as movies based on video games go, the Resident Evil series has been a cut above the rest.  One good reason for this is the director, Paul WS Anderson, and his wife, actress Milla Jovovich (as Alice), who have created all four of the films together.  None of the last three has quite topped the first RE, but then that's usually the case with sequels, right? (With a few notable exceptions.)  Still, this 2010 version of RE is pretty impressive, especially with the introduction of 3D to the RE universe.  The story consists of several very strong scenes separated by passages of relative dullness.  The same is true of the 3D, which is used well at various points along the way, but there are also many times where it wouldn't have made any difference whether things were shown in 2 or 3D (as when the only 3D is the character standing out against the background).  But when this movie is good, it is very very good.  That includes highlights such as the 3D shots of Alice's small plane flying over coastal Cali and a destroyed LA; and especially the fight with the giant, hooded Executioner guy (probably the film's best scene).  By contrast, the climactic fight with the main Umbrella Corp bad guy near the end feels relatively ordinary.

While I enjoyed RE Afterlife and am glad I saw it, there were a few minor problems (sorta) such as how so many fight scenes borrowed very heavily from The Matrix (something a lot of filmmakers do).  That gave some of the fighting a ""been there, done that"" feeling.  Also there were a bunch of things that either were not explained, didn't make sense, or defied any logic.  In the ""no explanation"" category is the Executioner -- what is he and where did he come from?  I think the answer is he exists for no reason except to be a cool, scary enemy, as was generally true of other ""monsters"" in both the games and movie series.  But with the ""Suspension of Disbelief"" required in all movies of this type, these kinds of issues were really not problems.  Those things were not the main reason I dropped a star in my rating.  No, it was the lulls in action and 3D during the movie.  But the good things definitely outweighed the bad overall.",1284076800,24,2186,4.50761421319797
4271007,4,B0046MOVD0,"I didn't expect to be writing this, but Resident Evil: Afterlife might be my favorite of the series so far. Sure the plot is weak and the characters are thinly written, but each individual movie has never really been about that. It's just another continuation of one large story that will probably come to an end in the next installment.

Aside from being easy on the eyes, Milla Jovovich (who somehow looks better than ever), still makes for a compelling action hero and Ali Larter sure looks good standing next to her. The other characters here, including Prison Break's Wentworth Miller as Chris Redfield, aren't given that much to do, but they also don't get on your nerves. I did appreciate the fact that they cut out all of the needless trying too hard to be funny dialogue of the past. You know, the scenes involving Mike Epps. Wesker made for a decent villain and the big dude carrying the axe put the silly looking Nemesis creature from Apocalypse to shame. Paul W.S. Anderson returns after two sequels and the visual quality is a step up. While he's far from being a great director, his good attributes show up on screen.

As for a few minor negatives. Like I said before, the story just links the 3rd movie to the future 5th, but there is still enough going on to hold your interest. Not only did the final fight scene borrow too heavily from The Matrix, but all those people emerging in those white outfits reminded me of The Island as well. Now as far as the slow motion goes, it looked good in 3-D, but was overused.

The bottom line is that if you're a fan of the movie series you've come to the right place and should know what to expect. You have two attractive women, good CGI, exciting fight scenes complete with rated R violence (yay!), with no shortness of B movie vibe.

The IMAX 3-D experience was worth the extra $4, even though most of the scenes, other than when stuff was flying trough the air, looked rather flat. Make sure you don't do what I did by leaving the theater too fast. I read that there is a scene about 30 seconds into the end credits that features Sienna Guillory in the Jill Valentine role once again.",1284076800,5,2144,4.461734693877551
