7883503,5,6305081018,"Whispering Waters is a series of artistically captured water images designed to soothe the soul and bring instant calm to your day. Shot on location in Yosemite National Park, the scenes are beautifully serene. The natural landscapes are set to an original piano score and the water images range from majestic waterfalls to delicately peaceful streams. As water cascades down sheer walls and one images fades into the next a sense of calm descends on you making this a very relaxing escape when you are in need of solace. Many of the images would only be accessible to the most adventurous hiker so the stunning beauty is eloquently captured as water cascades into hidden pools surrounded by lush vegetation. If you enjoy the Moodtapes, ""Serenity"" is also a beautiful journey into nature.

7883504,5,6305081018,This is one of my favorite Yosemite DVD's ever! The waterfalls and mountain streams are magnificent! I love the gentle music mixed with the natural sounds. Sometimes I play it with just the natural sounds and it's like being right there in Yosemite! Excellent quality! One of the best!,1154822400,,285,4.836734693877551
7883505,5,6305081018,This is an update from my last review. The Whispering Water dvd does have a choice of just natural sounds or natural sounds with music. A few of the copies that got out were the wrong ones but they are correcting the problem. Just contact imagine entertainment and give your address and when they get the new ones they will ship them.,1069459200,3,334,4.403225806451613
