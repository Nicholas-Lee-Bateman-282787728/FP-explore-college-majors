974617,3,6305135002,"A military brat who ran wild, Joe Dallesandro did a number of nude modeling jobs for ""physique"" magazines before he stumbled into Warhol in 1967.  Warhol might have been problematic as an artist, but he did have a talent for surrounding himself with the extreme personalities from which he fed.  He knew a good thing when he saw it, and for the next several years Dallesandro was a fixture at Warhol's ""factory"" and made one Warhol-produced, Morrissey-directed film after another.  But there is really only one reason to watch any of them, and that is hope that Dallesandro will get naked.  And very often he does.

The simple truth is that Morrissey, who typically wrote, edited, and directed these films, is extremely bad at all three.  There's not much in the way of plot or script, and it seems Morrissey worked by creating a written outline of the scene and then letting his actors riff on it in bad improvisation for the actual filming.  As for acting, you can pretty much forget about it, for none of the performers are actors in any real sense: they are who they are, which to say they are entirely without talent but they are vaguely interesting because they themselves are so extreme.  That really is what Joe Dallesandro and Holly Woodlawn and the rest were like.

Like most Warhol-Morrissey-Dallesandro outings the plot is so slight that it is virtually non-existent.  Dallesandro is a heroin junkie who has shot up so many times he has become impotent--and this proves to be a tremendous source of frustration to virtually everyone who comes his way, including Holly Woodlawn, a trash-picker/hoarder with whom he lives; Geri Miller, a go-go dancer; rich girl Andrea Feldman; the upscale couple Bruce Pecheur and Jane Forth; and pregnant Diane Podel.  The entire film revolves around Dallesandro's efforts to score heroin, and one and all seem horrified by his use of the drug.  This may not be acting: Dallesandro does indeed shoot up in his scenes.  We can't know what was in the needle, but the way Dallesandro goes about it indicates that he wasn't exactly innocent where the process was concerned, and he does indeed seem stoned in the aftermath.

Dallesandro couldn't act worth a damn and he relies on his chief asset to get him through: he spends a lot of his on-screen time completely naked in all his rough-trade glory.  Geri Miller is entertainingly giggly, jiggly, and attractively naked as the go-go girl, and Jane Forth walks off with best scene and lines in the film.  But where acting was concerned the big noise was Holly Woodlawn, whose freakish performance was so admired that everyone from George Cukor to Joanne Woodward lobbied for an Oscar nomination.  Woodlawn didn't get one, perhaps because the Academy thought the movie too trashy, perhaps because the Academy didn't know if Woodlawn, a transexual, should be nominated as Best Supporting Actor or Best Supporting Actress.  My opinion: nobody lobbied for Woodlawn to be nominated and it was all a bad taste hoax joke at Woodlawn's expense.  Still, Woodlawn is the lynchpin of the whole thing and possesses tremendous energy, so she gets an A for effort.

When all is said and done, TRASH is actually a cut above most of the Warhol-Morrissey-Dallesandro films, partly because it gives us plenty of Dallesandro nudity, partly because it is freakish in a way that still holds up today, and partly because--largely due to Woodlawn, Miller, and Forth--it has a darkly comic edge.  Still, most fans will hit the fast-forward more than once, and non-fans will consider the whole thing unbearably bad.

974618,3,6305135002,"Despite the gracious full frontal male nudity which is shocking now days, this film is boring! Even though D'Allesandro (the random hung naked guy of many Morissey / Warhol films) is every inch (literally) gorgeous (despite crawling around looking like a homeless man), nothing prevents the crawling creeping restless boredom of this film. (If that was the intent of this film, well then-well done.) If nothing else it serves as a prompting for a liberal's worst nightmare awakening: that hippies and alt. culture are hated for some good reasons. It serves well too as a proverbial ""van down by the river"": it will deeply motivate you to do something with your life and never end up like this. Nancy Reagan should've thought of this film when she was telling kids to just say no.",1089072000,6,779,4.82089552238806
974619,2,6305135002,"The movie is really trash. The movie starts out showing Joe Dallesandro's [rear] and Geri Miller go-go dancing naked. Later on in the movie we meet Holly Woodlawn a trash collector who is a transvestite and a former prostitute. More graphic nudity and sex come up when Jane Forth and her husband come in the story. An all right beginning,middle, and end but the story is terrible.",1014508800,4,380,4.686567164179104
974620,4,6305135002,"This film deals with drugs, very precisely heroin. We are in the post hippy period when drugs became an addiction after having been a life style. The drug addict is reduced in his sexuality, in his thinking and in his social life. He only survives in a hostile environment. But that was in 1970. The environment of the drug addict is either looking for easy kicks by flirting with drugs (high-school students for example), or for sexual kicks among young middle class couples or people who try to use the uninhibited life of the drug addict to have physical contacts with them or to beef up their own boring and fading relations, or for some advantage they can get from them in exchange of some welfare money (social workers for example). This leads to the sad conclusion that drug addicts who look for a certain liberation in a trip beyond limits find themselves entirely trapped in a fake world where alienation is demultiplied by their addiction. The film is of course also a piece of art by the fact that it refuses any kind of special effects or heavy production and the pictures only speak because they are plain, simple, and yet tremendously worked on by the simple technique of the camera, physical acting and voices. The expressivity of the film comes from those simple elements and the realistic revealing dialogue that goes along with it. The feeling we get is that of a totally poignant fatality that pens up the drug addict in a fully lost battle for survival. There seems to be only death at the end of the road.

974621,2,6305135002,"As a fan of cult cinema and gay underground films, I admit, my expectations for this DVD were pretty slim.  I knew Dallesandro would be a  visual feast, if not a genuine screen presence.  Other than that, I can't  say that I expected this film to impress me.
Well, it didn't.  I've waded  through John Waters' early efforts with more mirth than this sad film could  hope to inspire.  Laughing at this film is like empathizing with the  upper-crust couple that Joe has the misfortune of encountering: hollow  yucks at squalor and cheap thrills for the terminally jaded.
There IS a  story here, of sorts, but Morrissey is determined to ignore it in favor of  ""moody"" shots of Joe looking thoughtful, or just strung-out.  The  acting has the same over the top quality as that of Waters' 70's films, but  the dialogue simply doesn't have the same insanely humorous spark.
There are a few moments that will have even non-fans sitting up in their  recliners, though.  For me, the scene where Holly gives a nice upstate boy  a shot of heroin in the butt was a classic.  And though the way she strips  him and slavers over his naked body could be described as grotesque, it's  also fascinating.
The best that I can say for this film is that it has a  strong visual allure, whether it's one of Joe's many nude scenes, or a  profile shot of Holly, all overbite and eye makeup.  If you're a fan of  Warhol or Morrissey, I'm sure you have a deeper appreciation for  ""Trash.""  If you're just an interested viewer, like myself, you  may find my comments here to be of some use before considering a  purchase.

974622,5,6305135002,"Bruce Pecheur, the actor playing the husband of Jane Forth, was murdered in his Greenwich Village apartment by an intruder while the movie was still playing in New York. Jane Forth (Who for my money had the best lines in the  film- ""Now get in here and rape me!"") was a highly paid fashion  model who was to become a Warhol regular but reportedly dropped out to go  back to the runway.

974623,5,6305135002,"Trash is a film that is unlike any other, as is the two inferior films in the trilogy Flesh and Heat. Trash is a very funny though in the end rather sad look at impotent heroin addict Joe (Joe Dallasandrio) who is surrounded  by women who want to cure him of his problem. One of whom is Holly (played  by transvestite Holly Woodlawn in one of the most memorable performances  ever) who in one bizarre scene even masturbates with a beer bottle. The two  final scenes where Holly confronts Joe and when the welfare guy come around  are two of my all time favourite scenes. The DVD release is rather  dissapointing for not only is it entirely devoid of special features but  something went bung in the transfer as the colour black in some scenes  appears to look negative (as in film negative). Nevertheless Trash is a gem  for any fan or cult enthusist with a DVD player.",951696000,7,869,4.449367088607595

7884163,4,6305135002,"One reviewer really said it all about this movie,  that the best thing one can get from watching it is hoping Joe D'Alessandro gets naked and he mostly always does.  No one needs to expect a plot or good acting - you'll be sorely disappointed.  We saw it in 1970, a time when shock value was a reason to do, say, or see anything and Warhol's 'stars' were all on that bandwagon.  It is certainly a product of the free love anything goes drug experiment era.  I actually remembered absolutely nothing about it pretty quickly except that I'd had me some eye candy.",1414281600,,561,4.407766990291262
7884164,3,6305135002,"I had been interested for some time in seeing one of Paul Morrisseys earlier films after seeing and enjoying both Flesh For Frankenstein and Blood For Dracula. Both films were truly memorably campy, gory, sexually strange and bizzare. They had that certain unusual quality that is hard to describe, but none the less I really liked both films. This is the first from the trilogy of Flesh, Trash and Heat that I have seen. I found the film utlimately boring in general, but there was a certain experimental quality I liked. That signature Morrissey feel. The film is more of an exploration of a few days in the life of a junkie played by Joe Dallesandro, who suprisingly does a pretty good naturalistic acting job in this film that outshines his very poor performances in Blood for Dracula and Flesh for Frankenstein. But then again the backdrop of New York city and the naturalistic acting method coupled with improvisation probably wouldnt be too hard to do considering a junkie could generally be played convincingly as a dull personality with some earthy and basic qualities. I must say that this film is very bland and explorative, but Holly Woodlawn was amazingly good as Joes room mate. Her acting was truly pretty marvelous. I mean nearly oscar worthy. Other than that there is some graphic drug use, graphic sexually suggestive language, a couple of R rated sex scenes and a whole lot of bad acting and boring conversation. This is petty much experimental territory here, and this certainly isn't a bad film as an exploitive production, but It deserves 2 stars for its timeless originality and a third for Woodlawns performance. The obvious focus though is Joe and his glorious body and member which present themselves in their naked rawness off and on through out the movie. The title says it all. The film is pretty much Trash, but its good Trash.",1367884800,3,1857,4.80625

Dallesandro's unassuming approach shows a man trying to improve his crummy life without tearing other people down.  He tries to ignore the flaws of Holly Woodlawn's character and tries to ride above them.  Paul Morrissey's writing and directing are not refined, but they're direct and allow the characters to tell the story.",1335225600,2,492,4.975609756097561
7884168,4,6305135002,"Dallesandro was one of the first actors to show himself naked. TRASH was one of a trilogy of films. I believe the last movie he was in, at least that I saw, was THE COTTON CLUB.  At one time he was driving a cab in Hollywood. There hasn't been much mention of him in many years.

He was interviewed in the special section of BEEFCAKE, (DVD) that was about a guy in Los Angeles who photographed young men for his publication called PHYSIQUE PICTORIAL  That film is now long ago too and Dallesandro is morphing into his senior years. He starred in a few more Warhol films and looked and acted like the male hustler he was. He was very popular in the 60's and now a cult figure of the past.
