3447959,5,B001AGXEBU,"what can I say, the more Doctor Who that is released the better the world is. great redone special effects and of course the original version.",1221004800,4,142,4.5
3447960,4,B001AGXEBU,"In startling contrast to the minimalist scale of the story preceding it (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Horror-of-Fang-Rock-Episode-92/dp/B0009PVZFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - Horror of Fang Rock (Episode 92)</a>), ""The Invisible Enemy"" is an outrageously ambitious ""Doctor Who"" tale daring to span the expanses of both inner and outer space, flaunting all the pesky restrictions on the show as it does so. With predictably mixed results, but the brave successes well outweigh the few embarrassing flops in the final analysis. And as for the latter, well, nothing ventured, nothing gained--why let them deter one from enjoying this fine science fiction adventure?

And fine it is, with a brilliant premise: a microscopic organism with predatory intelligence lingers in the outer reaches of our solar system, waiting dormant for humankind to reach it, be infected and effectively controlled by it, and by so doing manage to proliferate across the stars carried along by their ultimately disposable hosts. It's the old biological game of survival of the fittest with an ugly interstellar twist. And of course the moment of crisis happens as the story opens somewhere near a refueling base on Saturn's moon Titan around the year 5000--the first humans are infected, as is the Doctor (by the virus's nucleus, its reproductive core and commanding conscious force, no less), since the Tardis just so happens to have materialized nearby. Most of the story then transpires on a medical base built into an asteroid, where temporary clones of the Doctor and his companion Leela are engineered by a certain Doctor Marius and his canine-formed computer, shrunken to microscopic size, and injected into the Doctor's brain to seek out the invisible enemy and destroy it--and one of the chief peculiar highlights of the story is this ""fantastic voyage"" through bizarrely organic landscapes.

The plot's twists and turns include the virus nucleus growing to macroscopic scale towards the end, which as it happens is the story's main downfall. The enemy was sinister and creepy when unseen and undetectable, and most of that evaporates immediately as he plops out awkwardly into the harsh hospital (i.e. studio) lights. The cloning idea is interesting, but both clones spring into existence fully clothed and (in the case of Leela) armed, which strains plausibility past the breaking point--as does the whole idea of shrinking people and things (including laser pistols) down to a microscopic scale without hindering their functioning. There are a few other gaffs of this nature, too, but still the overall drama holds one's interest nonetheless. Tom Baker is in top form as the Fourth Doctor and gets some particularly good lines from the script, Leela is beautifully aggressive, and Doctor Marius makes for a nicely memorable supporting character. And last but not least, this story marks the introduction of an iconic if pleasantly childish part of the Doctor Who mythos: his annoyingly clever pet computer K9, entrusted to him by Marius at the last minute. Love him or loathe him, here's where he rolls into the picture.

This DVD set thus also comes with the very first Doctor Who spin-off, ""K9 and Company""--the inclusion of which makes sense then despite the four years or so intervening (1977 and 1981, respectively). I'm not much for spin-offs personally, and I'd most likely not have set out to obtain this on its own, but since it's included anyway I found it a pleasant enough little diversion and an interesting blind alley in Doctor Who history (and, in retrospect, the forerunner of the current spin-off,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sarah-Jane-Adventures-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B001993YCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sarah Jane Adventures - The Complete First Season</a>). In any case, is this bit of an oddity plus the admittedly flawed yet ultimately wonderful classic Doctor Who story ""The Invisible Enemy"" worth your hard-earned credits?

3447966,3,B001AGXEBU,"If you like Doctor Who as campy, than this DVD is for you. There are fans who are disappointed in this story as it follows a trilogy of solid stories such as, ""Robots of Death,""  But this wasn't isn't horrible. The effects are mostly on the silly side particularly the reveal of the monster. The idea of sending a clone that could last for only 10 minutes inside the Doctor (or the idea that you could make these clones faster than a minute egg) is just insane but it's insane in a good way.  Leela  has some really funny moments in the Invisible Enemies, moments that aren't funny by making her stupid but in ways that are true to her character. She also carries the action very well.

Invisible Enemies would probably be between 3 and 4 stars, but what makes it a three star DVD is the K-9 and Company episode. A series starring Sarah Jane Smith worked, however it doesn't work all that well with John Nathan Turner producing. The program began with an opening theme that was almost painfully 1980s. It suffered from horrific pacing that made the first part incredibly dull. The rest of it suffered from a non-sensical script that leaves many questions. Satanic human sacrifice as a plot for a family Christmas special? What were the occultists even doing in Sarah Jane's house in the first place? And that's just the Spoiler-free questions. The series' pilot's only value is how comically it fails, as well as K-9 being awesome.",1411257600,,1431,4.6

my friend on YouTube, Zaranyzerak, would recommend this, along with other Doctor Who Stories, with the exception of the Lost and/or Missing, and/or believed-to-be-destroyed episodes that are still out there.

Great story from the Tom Baker Years. and an even greater spin-off that comes with it.

3447978,5,B001AGXEBU,"The Tom Baker era story entitled ""The Invisible Enemy"" takes place thousands of years into the future. Mankind has just begun to explore the solar system and beyond. A spaceship from Earth is making its way towards Jupiter's moon Titan where the crew will replace the current staff and help those crafts going beyond. Along the way the ship enters a strange nebula and within seconds the crew of three become infested with a space borne plague and with it the first of many to begin to serve the swarm.
  The ship lands and those who were celebrating the arrival and there time spent on Titan was short lived as they themselves become infected and the base controller sends a distress signal to anyone who can help. Meanwhile in the TARDIS the Doctor is moving back into the main control room since they have been in the secondary control room for sometime.  Leela watches the Dcotr and for a brief moment she watches as the Doctor becomes infected with the swam parasites.  Even worse the swam's leader has taken over the Doctor's body.  However due to the fact that the Doctor is a Time Lord and not human it will take more time to take over his body and begin the process to convert to the swarm.
  The Doctor realzing he needs help tries to fight it and with the aide of Leela travels to an asteroid hospital. There they meet a professor in charge who specialies in exotic diseases and finds what the Doctor has fantasitc. The professor is also aided by his robotic dog K-9 who serves him with logic and a laser that is dead on. The swarm hears the mental commands of the swarm leader they travel there to infect more and retive the leader.  The Doctor is losing time with no real help through the professor. So he asks him to clone him and Leela for a plan he has. With a clone of the Doctor using componets of the TARDIS he shrinks himself and clone Leela and inject into the Doctor to fight the parasite from within.  Can a clone of the Doctor racing against the clock save the real Doctor and stop the swarm before it begins to spread? Why is it that Leela is immune to this illness? Will they find a cure and stop the swarm? Or will mankind become hosts to something that will rule the universe?
  The second disc entitled K-9 and company is a special cerated at the time to be a spin off featuring Elizabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith and her first encounter with her dog K-9 mark III.  After her time with the Doctor she travels to her Aunt's house where she finds a large package has been waiting for her for sometime. Once she opens it she discovers K-9 a gift from the Doctor to keep her safe and to be of help. During the holidays her Aunt is away and she staying with her aunt's ward to keep him company. While in the town itself strange things begin to happen. A coven has arised and wishes to plunge the world into darkness and scarfices are needed.  They also say they command a demon hound that is bound to ther coven's leader and with it are unstoppable. Sarah along with her new freind K-9 is going to show those that practice magic that its nothing compared to resourceful reporter and a dog made from the future.",1322784000,3,3136,4.367697594501718
3447979,3,B001AGXEBU,"""The Invisible Enemy"" marked a subtle transition in Doctor Who as producer Graham Williams, still in his first season, was pressured to veer the show away from grittier, horror-centered stories, such as the previous ""Horror of Fang Rock,"" toward brighter, more fun-filled scripts. ""Invisible Enemy"" is also remembered as the story that, for better or worse, introduced a robot dog named K9. Love him or hate him (and fans did both), K9 would remain a regular feature of the program for four years.

Sadly, the gothic horror of the Philip Hinchcliffe-Robert Holmes years produced some of the best shows in the series' history, including the previous season's ""Talons of Weng-Chiang,"" but also led to somewhat of a public backlash that the stories were too scary and violent. ""The Invisible Enemy,"" by contrast, juggled some interesting sci-fi concepts, such as cloning, but was pretty much a shameless ripoff of the 1966 sci-fi movie classic ""Fantastic Voyage."" With the introduction of a new, radio-controlled robot character, the story was also plagued with special effects problems.

The crew of a shuttle to Titan is infected by an interplanetary virus that wants to establish a hive on Saturn's moon. The Doctor is infected with the ""nucleus"" of this unseen foe, which we will later learn looks like a giant prawn. At a nearby space hospital, clones of the Doctor and Leela are miniaturized and injected into the infected Doctor's brain in hopes of finding an antidote. The story copies ""Fantastic Voyage"" down to the smallest detail, including the clones' planned escape through a tear duct.

The voyage into the Doctor's brain required Tom Baker and Louise Jameson to work in both colorful, imaginatively designed sets created through color separation overlay and actual physical sets that proved less convincing. The sterile, laser-pistol shootouts look ridiculous, with actors firing in one direction and the resulting laser blasts lighting up somewhere else. K9 keeps crashing into things, sometimes becoming wedged in scenery or breaking down altogether. In one scene, he is required to shoot out a section of wall to create a barrier. The first take didn't look quite right, so the crew shot it again but didn't have time to cover up the seam where the wall broke away in the first take or even to sweep up debris left on the floor from the earlier shot.

This two-disc set also includes ""K9 and Company: A Girl's Best Friend,"" a TV special broadcast in 1981 that was hoped might spin off into its own series featuring the robot dog and former Doctor Who companion Sarah Jane Smith. Elisabeth Sladen looks great here, but after four years, K9 had clearly expended whatever magic he might have once had, and a new series was not to be.",1312502400,4,2745,4.973856209150327

3447982,5,B001AGXEBU,"I don't have a lot of time to do this review so I'll make it short.

Doctor Who: The Invisible Enemy

I have the VHS version that only features the original special effects, not the new special effects, so when I comment on the special effects, I'm referring to the original ones. Special effects at times are great, and at other times are lame, but the story, plot, acting, and directing are all great! The Doctor's taken over by an intelligent space virus that wants to conquer all of space and time. This is truely a great story, and is highly recommended! Five stars.

Not much here to offer except for the return of K9 and Sarah. Two stars.

Once one gets past these rather inconsequential shortcomings, however, Doctor who is generally a combination of both acting and teleplay brilliance!

The Invisible enemy is no different. Amongst the excellent focal points of this ""episode"" are: the introduction of K-9 (who preceded even R2-D2 in the cute robot milieu), Leela at the top of her form, Tom Baker - brilliant as always, and a rather interesting plot involving a microorganism with intelligence.

Furthermore, this DVD includes K-9 and Company. As a kid, I always wanted, but was never able to see this quirky chapter in the Doctor Who canon. To be honest, I thought it was quite fun. The theme song, by the way, hilariously embraces the kitzchy-ness of 1970's techno-disco.
