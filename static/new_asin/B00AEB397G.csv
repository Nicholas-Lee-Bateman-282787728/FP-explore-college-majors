8550336,5,B00AEB397G,"This is a two DVD set in the nineties and provides a fascinating window into truly handmade guitar making by Benito Huipe, a Mexican luthier from Paracho (Paracho de Verduzco), Michoacn, Mxico, a country town about halfway between Guadalajara and Mexico City, where the town revolves around handmade guitar building. At the time Benito Huipe had been working as a luthier in Los Angeles, California where the guitar building on the over 3 hours of video took place in Benito's shop. Today Paracho has matured in its lutherie focus in many ways... gaining access to typical and traditional luthier tools, some machinery with accompanying cultural and vocational investment in Paracho as the lutherie and handmade guitar capital of Paracho.  About every other door in Paracho leads into a lutherie shop or lutherie or guitar related store. Benito Huipe has long since returned to his hometown of Paracho where he is still building beautiful handmade guitars to this day. This two DVD video set should be of interest to those who play a classical guitar, anyone who is a collector along with novice or experienced builders of classical guitars, and of course of interest to everyone desiring to expand their historical and cultural view of our neighbor to the south, Mexico, where the people are overwhelmingly hospitable, kind, warm and friendly.  I have said a lot here about Paracho, the guitar town of Mexico, because I think the historical and cultural import of these DVDs should not be overlooked. Should this DVD set become unavailable on Amazon, you can always get the DVD set directly from the person who put it together, Ron Fernandez, a cordial person, guitar player and luthier himself.  I have  no connection to Ron, Benito or Paracho other than being a fan of all three. Ron Fernandez can be reached via his website [...] where he has a simple and eclectic view into his semi-retirement and where you can find these DVDs for sale when and if they disappear from Amazon.",1425600000,,1981,4.922155688622754
