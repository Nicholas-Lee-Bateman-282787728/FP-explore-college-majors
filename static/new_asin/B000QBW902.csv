8723179,5,B000QBW902,My family loved this DVD. We have watched it twice and will probably watch it again.  We are so grateful to The Coulter family for making this DVD.  Our son is 4 years old and recently diagnosed with Aspergers. This DVD was very insightful and has identified some of the traits we need to watch for. We recommend this DVD for dads and entire family.,1437782400,,349,4.3538461538461535
