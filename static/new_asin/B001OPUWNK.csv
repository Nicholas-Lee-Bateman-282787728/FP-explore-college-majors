8392078,1,B001OPUWNK,"I'm a huge Nas fan and I just wanted another title to add to my collection, but this was a total waste and I am very disappointed. Forget the hour that it lasted, in the first 10 minutes I was disappointed. Throughout the video there a poor excuse for a narrator who pronounces names wrong with fake pics not even corresponding with what he says. I heavily doubt Nas had any input in this and please..... I beg please don't make the same mistake I did by wasting your money on this nonbiography.",1252195200,5,495,4.333333333333333
8392079,1,B001OPUWNK,"I'm a huge hip-hop fan and Nas is one of my favorite artists. For awhile now I've been looking for a good concert/informative video on Nas to add to my DVD library. ""Nas, I Don't Understand Hip Hop"" was a bad choice.

This DVD is awful. It's pretty much a video version of a Wikipedia article. There is no concert footage, no special features, and no information that you couldn't find by doing a 2 minute Google search for ""Nas"".

The entire video is this narrator talking about Nas' life with video stills of Nas or whomever the narrator is discussing in the background . . . for an hour . . . I wish I had that hour back.

What's worse, whomever made this POS didn't even know how to pronounce half the people he was talking about. He pronounced Nas' wife's name, as if it were spelled ""Kel-iss"" (as opposed to ""Kel-ees"") and this was almost funny, he pronounced AZ as ""AZZ"". AZZ would've been a better title for this DVD because that's what it was: A$$.

I'm still looing for a Nas DVD that's more than just a bunch of his videos. Do Not Waste Your Money on This Garbage. It sucks and I doubt seriosuly that nas was involved in it's production or that he is receiving one cent off its revenue.

Blech. Not two thumbs down, this one gets the finger.",1239840000,8,1252,4.288135593220339
