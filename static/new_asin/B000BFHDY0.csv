2415676,5,B000BFHDY0,"John Scott is an amazing teacher, unfortunately not as well know in the US as he is in the UK. John's focus to breath bandha and dristi is unmatched. This video is great for those of you making your way into the Ashtanga practice. You can break it off in small chunks by choosing your level of practice. This seems to be the best presentation of the traditional method for learning the poses slowly over time on a DVD. No one should learn everything from a DVD but this a very nice supplement to your practice. John has a calming melodic voice that brings a bit of softness to a very demanding practice... truly from his heart, you can't go wrong with this DVD.",1235174400,10,661,4.338709677419355

8086051,5,B000BFHDY0,"After practicing Hatha for years I took a workshop with Kino MacGreggor and decided to start a daily Ashtanga practice; something a little more focused/energetic/with ample time to breathe the joints open in those poses that need it.  I got books and DVDs to fully educate myself - This DVD is the best of all the ones I ordered - David Swenson, Kino, etc.  They are all Jois students from Mysore, India, so their primary series is the same sequence of poses.  For daily practice, I feel that simple is better - just breath and counting off poses is all you need - if there are descriptions and explanations beyond reminders where to focus the gaze or mind, it gets old fast, especially when the talking causes you to lose count/breath.  John Scott seems to know this and has made this DVD so that the count and breath are never subverted. If you're watching it for entertainment value the constant breathing might seem a bit odd, but for practice it is ideal.

In addition the pace is perfect in my opinion, the extremely simple background with no visual clutter almost looks like John is floating in a cloud.  I think his focus is right and clear and easy to follow.  If you are looking for a daily practice video for the primary series, I highly recommend this one.",1472256000,,1268,4.535087719298246
8086052,4,B000BFHDY0,"This video is really great for beginners. The explanations are clear and the breathing is emphasized. However, if you know the practice and just need a reminder of the order, this video is a tad bit slow.",1444435200,,204,4.54054054054054
8086053,5,B000BFHDY0,"I preface this review by saying I do not think it is fair to judge a yoga video on where or not the viewer enjoys the particular style. I rate the videos on how well the style is executed, demonstrated, explained.

Ashtanga yoga is a challenging practice for even an advanced beginner. One must understand dristi, bandha, and pranayama in addition to being able to execute asana. If you come to yoga with prior experience in other disciplines that emphasize body awareness (dance or gymnastics for example) you will naturally and organically understand the practice - and if you don't?Avoid frustration taking some classes with a live teacher and use this dvds as supplements to your practice.

If this is your one and only intro to yoga, you're doing yourself a disservice.

This sequence was written by Patabi Jois, the teacher of both John Scott and David Swenson. I have both Dvds, and they are filmed so that they run exactly the same time. For example if you go 46 minutes into the Swenson dvd you will end up at the exact same pose at 46 minutes on this one. Both are filmed without music. Frankly if doing yoga to music is your thing, you probably won't ever like Ashtanga, as it is a meditative style focusing on breath.

If you are NOT sure what a pose is supposed to look like, it is helpful to see an accomplished yoga practitioner execute it.  Watching Scott move with ease and grace from one pose to another is very inspiring. But mostly I do not look at the screen when I used this. I find his direction helpful.

Unlike another reviewer I did not find the sound of his breath distracting nor overpowering. It is useful and correct to practice with Ujayi breath, which many people leave out when practicing yoga.

As the other reviewers mentioned you can chose a beginner practice, or a half practice or just go as far as you can and stop etc. ""beginner"" only equals ""shorter"" in terms of time - don't expect prep poses, that is not the nature of Ashtanga. If you can't do even one sun salute well, practice that before further for the best results. Practice daily and results will happen quickly if you are in reasonable shape.

If you are overweight, out of shape, new to yoga, and using this as a way to avoid going to a live class, exercise caution in order to avoid injuries.",1419292800,,2295,4.513253012048192
8086054,5,B000BFHDY0,"This guy is terrific. The routine is challenging, but accessible and can be worked through at multiple levels. As in a ""live""  yoga class, you should perform each segment to the best of your own ability, challenging yourself gradually, to become stronger and more proficient through practice.",1409961600,,292,5.212765957446808
8086055,4,B000BFHDY0,"this item arrived fast in good condition, and I am satisfied with the purchase.  I like practicing yoga, and this is a nice practice to follow.",1389398400,,143,4.5
8086056,5,B000BFHDY0,"Along with David Swenson and Richard Freeman's DVDs this is in the top three for Ashtanga yoga practice of the primary series, but I give this DVD a special round of applause because it teaches what's called full vinyasa krama as opposed to the more prevalent half vinyasa krama. For those of you who know the difference, 'nuff said. For those of you who don't, K. Pattabhi Jois, who may be considered the originator or certainly the father of Ashtanga yoga, originally taught what's called full vinyasa. This means coming to standing in mountain pose/tadasana/samashtiti after each seated pose, and performing a sun salutation from the ""A"" series between each seated posture where you alternate sides. As Ashtanga grew in popularity and students began to overflow from the practice room in Mysore, the half vinyasa style became prevalent, in which one remains seated during the seated series of poses, though there are plenty of sun salutations. Swenson and Freeman show the half vinyasa style, which is far more common. Scott demonstrates the full vinyasa style, as does his book. For that alone the DVD is excellent. But he's also a wonderful teacher (as wonderful as you can be on a DVD), and while I wouldn't give up my Swenson DVDs, I love Scott for showing the full vinyasa style, as does Lino Miele's DVD, though that is apparently available only in PAL. Which is not to say that full vinyasa is better than half. Jois, or Guruji as he's called by his students, would sometimes prescribe one over the other, and each has its advantages. But I have a preference for the old ways and feel that if I learn something in its most comprehensive form I can more readily remove pieces than add. The DVD lets you select from five levels from beginner to the full primary series. And it offers four language selections, English, German, Mandarin, and Japanese. I like Scott's book, too. I am lazy and need things to inspire me to get to the mat, and a great DVD like this one can do that.",1332115200,6,1986,4.693409742120344
8086057,5,B000BFHDY0,"John was my teacher 21 years ago in Hood River, Or. This DVD is so well done, I feel like he is here with me. The instruction is profoundly clear, especially in regards to the breath, which will help you to establish and continue your practice no matter what your level of proficiency.",1289174400,2,285,4.39622641509434
8086058,5,B000BFHDY0,No variations are given but this DVD provides several shorter versions of the Primary Series (in addition to the whole thing) for the less advanced.,1252713600,6,148,4.96
