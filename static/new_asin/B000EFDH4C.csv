2517464,5,B000EFDH4C,"Great Video. The best movie we've ever seen to tell the true story of St. Patrick. Although not every part of the movie can be 100% verified, all the known facts are included and much of the oral tradition about St. Patrick's life. Very well illustrated and a story we love to watch every year. A fun and very interesting movie that we've given as gifts to several friends with children.",1384214400,2,387,4.464788732394366
2517465,5,B000EFDH4C,"This is a great family movie or even just for the little ones too! Our 2 & 4 y/o sons, & 6 year old daughter ALL loved it and request to watch it over & over again. It is a terrific account of the story of St. Patrick and is well done in all respects. It does say in the beginning that some is fact & some is legend which is woven together. The music with it is also very catchy & enjoyable. I like how it does a quick 'review' of the story at the very end in a minute or so with the peppy music. I also showed it to my 1st grade religious education class on St. Patrick's Day and they thoroughly enjoyed it as much as my own children. It is one of those movies that we watch over & over again withOUT getting bored/annoyed. Educational. Fosters Christian values and devotion. Well worth it! :)  As a side note, I also recommend ""Juan Diego: Messenger Of Guadalupe"" produced in the same series which was also very well done. That one was equally well made in telling the story of Our Lady of Guadalupe & entertaining to watch. :)",1366070400,,1029,4.094059405940594

8108901,5,B000EFDH4C,"My 4 year old daughter loves this movie.  It has a mix of legend and reality, which helps make for an interesting story as well as teaching her about Saint Patrick.  She asks a lot of questions, and it's a great way to help teach her about the Lord, Saint Patrick, the early church, and her faith. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great faith-based cartoon for their children.  Ok, I'm an adult and I love it too!!!",1425340800,,433,4.3875
