3004417,5,B000XJD3G6,"My dad (matthew) got this for me for christmas, and I was so happy. Instant Star season 2 in my opinion is the best season. It has the Jommy drama, it has the amazing songs, and it has its cliffhangers that leaves you at the end of your seat wondering whats to come. If you're a fan of season 1, you'll love season 2!

3004430,3,B000XJD3G6,"I really enjoy this show and have watched it several times via netflix.  When netflix removed it from the streaming selection I thought ""I'll just buy the season on Amazon.""  I watched the free episodes and noticed that the lip sync is off the further you get into the show.  It appears that Amazon's encoding setup is incorrect.  I can see the video frames being dropped as I watch.  Every time a video frame gets dropped the lip sync gets further and further off.  This is a huge distraction and makes it difficult for me to watch the show.  This issue has kept me from purchasing the entire season 1 or 2.  For some reason, Season 3 & 4 do not have this issue.  Until amazon can resolve this issue I'll stick with my DVD's of season 1 & 2.",1398211200,,742,4.242857142857143

8228662,5,B000XJD3G6,"This show is so addicting. The mix of music in each episode is really nice. Alexz singing abilities are incredible. Then the ever growing love triangle of the show. (More like square at this point).  Jude is such a mixed character, no doubt she has flaws as a written character. She does focus about boys more than she should but she is a sixteen year old girl. Who doesn't crush at boys at that age? She's very smart about her music and I love watching her write and mix music throughout the whole season. The cool thing about this show is that each season is the span of ""the making of an album"". If you're interested in the music industry like I am this kind of show might just pull you in.

The one thing I have to mention as always is Tommy. He's such an interesting and odd character. I think he makes Jude a better musician and person but I think they also have so much issues that it's mind blowing.  I think they work so well together if only they both could just figure out how to communicate and just make it work. I do not condone relationships with age things as this sort. For the sake of the show, if they could just say what they want and go for it that'd save them so much back and forth. I love them together but sometimes I think they make each other too crazy.",1447632000,,1280,4.174089068825911
