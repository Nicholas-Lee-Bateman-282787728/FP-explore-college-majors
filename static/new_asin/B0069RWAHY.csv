4980671,5,B0069RWAHY,"This movie is based on a true story that, sadly, happens to many thousands of young women across America and the world.  With a life, career and future planned, things radically change in Kim's life (the leading actress) when she finds out that she is pregnant.  Pulled by all the forces of darkness and light as to what to do, Kim soon realizes the Word of God holds true, ""Man makes his plans but God orders his steps."" (Prov. 16:9).  Kim will find out that by listening to that ""still small voice"" of The Lord, her life will turn out better than she could have ever hoped.  Have a box of tissues handy!!",1349654400,22,606,4.336283185840708
4980672,4,B0069RWAHY,"Running Inside Out was a thoughtful and thought provoking movie about a woman struggling to find herself, while she's faced with a difficult, life altering decision regarding an unplanned pregnancy.  The characters were well drawn and the acting well done, bringing this story to life, while the main character grappled with an intense dilemma.  Consider watching this movie if you like well drawn character pieces with a story and a heartfelt message.",1346716800,12,452,5.263888888888889
4980673,5,B0069RWAHY,"Inspired by a true story, Kim embarks on her college career to journey through love, success and unexpected crisis. With a dream job, a fresh start and an inspired passion for running, Kim is forced to the edge by a sequence of painful life circumstances including an unplanned pregnancy. As her life crumbles and relationships fade, her hardened loneliness is unveiled. ""Who will stand with me? Who will love me -- just for me?""

This is a passionate film about one woman's search for a love that will last and the people who make a difference through ordinary acts of kindness.

An excellent film.  Lower budget but well done.  Worth seeing for sure.",1326240000,31,652,4.743362831858407

4980706,1,B0069RWAHY,"This movie, if you can call it that, is absolutely terrible. I think I could have made a better movie when I was 12. I wish there were negative stars as a rating.

4980731,1,B0069RWAHY,The acting and story was really bad and almost all the characters were mean or strange and very aggravating right till the end of the movie where a some good Christian characters surfaced but even them they could have done a lot more with. The worst I have bought on Amazon in nearly a hundred movies.,1366243200,3,301,4.392857142857143

8495437,5,B0069RWAHY,"Yes, this movie has its sad points. But, the important side is Kim learns a tough lesson that we all need to learn, too, when people turn on or hurt us--to forgive them and love them as Christ loves us. I would recommend this video for anyone who is facing or has faced times of being wronged and betrayed. But there is joy found in this movie, too! She has a fun run with her son near the end and reunites with Brad, her boyfriend!",1449360000,,432,4.094117647058823
8495438,3,B0069RWAHY,"The story is good, but much of the acting is amateurish.  I wish Pureflix would hire more accomplished and believable
 actors.  The lady who played the New Age aunt in the movie was downright ridiculous.  Not funny, ridiculous!",1442275200,,227,4.894736842105263
8495439,1,B0069RWAHY,"This DVD comes with who knows how many commercials at the start of movies whose trailers are rather unpleasant and long. The trailers are
not skipable - you have to watch them. I gave up before getting to the movie. I would not recommend buying anything from this company given they have so little respect for their customers.",1440201600,,326,4.637931034482759
8495440,2,B0069RWAHY,"This movie was labelled as 'white dove', so i bought it and reviewed for possibly watching this with a family that has kids.  I feel that white dove should not have been labelled on this movie.  As 1 review stated, this movie is for a mature/adult audience.  The theme of abortion, having sex outside of wedlock, then having another child as a result, is weaved throughout this entire movie.  You don't even get the sense that this is a Christian oriented movie until toward the end, when the young woman's parents (who have scolded and turned a cold shoulder to her during the entire movie), finally sit down and say 'Let's pray', and another lady keeps insisting on giving her (the woman who has the baby) pedicures for free.  The parents were hostile to their daughter during the entire movie.  The acting is poor, sub-par at best.  The woman who has the baby has 2 men (both responsible for getting her pregnant) leave her during the movie (2, not one, hmm?).  What kind of 'Christioan message are they sending out here??  Multiple men getting her pregnant, an abortion that has scarred her for life, hostile parents, and a woman who is totally a wreck and unstable.  And the acting, is terrible.  And this is a white dove movie?  You would think white dove would mean family safe, but that is very misleading.  With all the problems; theme and poor acting, I'm not sure if this is a movie I would be motivated to see again.  Nothing in this movie was redeeming.  At the end of the movie, they pray.  This movie needs a little more than prayer!",1438992000,2,1548,4.534296028880866
