7887886,4,630532056X,"Fans of Billy Drago (The Untouchables, Death Ring) will have to have this one for their collections. Drago doesn't get to play the lead role in many movies, being strong in character parts. But when the opportunity to observe the actor in a lead role comes around, they aren't disappointing. His quiet, psychotic creations have caused him to be typecasted in movies.  And one of them appears in ""Dolls"" giving fans a treat. Regular viewers won't be disappointed either because the cast and storyline are strong enough to make the movie a good thriller and leave viewers guessing until the end.",990576000,2,593,4.871287128712871
