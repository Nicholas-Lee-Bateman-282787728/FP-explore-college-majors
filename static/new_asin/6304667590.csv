7875699,5,6304667590,"I want this movie if you ship only a DVD, not vhs, poo, I would love to see this movie on my DVD player or on my computer. Do you understand?",1397088000,,141,3.5806451612903225
7875700,3,6304667590,This movie was listed as the People's Princess movie that was done back in 1998 with a list of British stars and that isn't correct.  This is the documentary that the BBC put out within the month that Diana died.  There are two versions of this documentary and both are good.  It is is a nice fluff piece about here life but not what I had wanted.,1166659200,,347,4.149253731343284
7875701,3,6304667590,"I thought this video was pretty interesting, covering the Princess's life as it did. Some of the footage isn't often seen, that's a plus. Some of the 'friends' interviewed, such as Penny Thornton, could've been left out in my opinion which would help the program along. (...)",1007856000,4,275,4.872340425531915
7875702,4,6304667590,"This tape goes over the basics of Diana, The pricess of Wales life from engagement to death. No one subject or area of her life is given preferential treatment, nor is it an in depth study of her life. But a must see for all Dianaholichs. This was produced rather quickly after her death with the proceeds going to the Princess of Wales Fund Established by the royal family. It is very interesting to hear how her friends viewed certain episodes in her life.",1003622400,5,458,4.464285714285714
