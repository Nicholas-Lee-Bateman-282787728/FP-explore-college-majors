8081348,5,B000B45NAC,"I have a copy of this VHS that I bought many years ago.  Grew up near St Louis and watched this thing go up as a young boy. Gave some good insight into just how difficult this critter was to erect.  It's short, but has good narration and video on top side completion.  I was amazed at the workers moving agily around top without safety belts.  OSHA would freak...
Good to see HOW it was built.....",1199059200,4,397,4.184210526315789
