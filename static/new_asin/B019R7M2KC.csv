7580798,5,B019R7M2KC,Jeffrey Self's acting in particular was really great. The writing was great. The aesthetic was great. Really loved this funny horror movie! Five stars.,1457740800,2,151,5.333333333333333

7580800,5,B019R7M2KC,"This movie's script is spot on. It's self-aware and hilarious, lampooning narcissism in the LA entertainment world. All the actors do a great job. Bryan Safi, one of the stars, is also one of my favorite podcasters, and he does an excellent job making fun of the culture of fame. As a horror genre film, it's gruesome enough, but it's not strictly a horror film. If you like satire, you'll enjoy this movie.",1457568000,7,407,4.589041095890411
7580801,5,B019R7M2KC,"I purchased this movie back when it was a new release (with no reviews), and I have to say -- I am so glad I did! With exceptional acting, outstanding casting (the lead character is GORGEOUS!!), and non-stop LOL humor, ""Your Killing Me"" is an all-around fantastic movie. Never void of L.A. man candy, this movie wreaks of utter hilarity!!

If you are on the fence about purchasing a copy, I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed by this twisted story line of comedic excellence. I can't wait to watch it again!",1457568000,7,520,4.531914893617022
7580802,5,B019R7M2KC,Lavender/Horror should be a new film genre after watching You're Killing Me.,1470787200,,76,5.416666666666667
7580803,4,B019R7M2KC,"I would consider this a romantic/comedy/horror film.  The comedic timing and acting are what made this film work.  It wasn't really believable , but i  enjoyed the film and it managed to capture my attention throughout.  If you ever had a boyfriend that you loved, but had to apologize for, this film is for you.  If you liked Dexter, you'll love this.",1469836800,,352,4.612903225806452

7580808,5,B019R7M2KC,"Clever plot. Amusing, and not overdone. The direction appears to be strong with pretty good casting. The story is very tongue in cheek humor. The lead actor is definitely a key to the film's success. Not all of the characters are likeable.",1462924800,4,239,4.714285714285714
7580809,1,B019R7M2KC,We found this to be a very disturbing movie.  There wasn't a enough humor to soften the blow.,1461888000,3,93,4.166666666666667

7580812,5,B019R7M2KC,"Just finished watching 'You're Killing Me"" released by Wolfe Video.
A quirky murder dramedy that at it's best moments achieves the right blend of horror and comedy that Alfred Hitchcock always strove for in his darker movies; ""You're Killing Me"" hits all the right notes as it lampoons the overly narcissistic life style of people who are seeking to extend their 15-minutes of Internet glory and fame and who are so far out of themselves that they can't see the horrible truth right in front of their eyes.
Spoiler Alert - this movie is a little bit gory at times; but it does catch the inner psychosis of Joe - the handsome slice and dice serial killer quite well.  Actress Mindy Cohn does a wonderfully funny turn as a good Samaritan whose unwitting act of kindness launches our helpless heroes int Internet Stardom.
Highly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1459728000,5,850,4.782312925170068

If you are curious, just say no.

I cannot believe this got a semi-serious release!

Shameful!",1459382400,4,127,4.681818181818182

7580816,4,B019R7M2KC,"We loved this movie. Is it a flawless movie with high production value? No it's not. Is it an interesting new take on the serial killer comedy? Yes it is. Will some people hate it? Obviously.

But if you love Jeffery's podcast, and love offbeat satire that skewers dating culture, LA culture, and narcissism, are you going to enjoy it? Yes you will. Are the actors so attractive you're gonna freak out? D'uh!",1458172800,4,408,4.589041095890411

8745903,5,B019R7M2KC,"I will be honest and admit that I was not expecting a great deal from this movie.  I thought it might be a laugh and I love to support LGBT cinema, because I always want them to make more.  The only way to get people/studios to make more is through spending some $$.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  This was a great little movie.  All of the actors did a great job and the story line was actually very enjoyable. I have actually watched it more than once.  You will enjoy it, so just buy it already.",1519344000,3,502,4.123711340206185

8745907,2,B019R7M2KC,"I wish I could like this movie.  It has a great premise, witty writing, and decent acting.  But, it evidently is for a very different audience than myself.  If the movie had shown a bit of restraint in the actual depiction of the murders, it would have worked.  There is nothing funny about actually watching the stabbings.  It had great ratings from horror fest so that should have been my clue, but its comparisons to Dexter and Gilmore Girls had me intrigued.  And if it had shown the slightest bit of restraint it could have been a comedic Hitchcock or a delightful update on Arsenic and Old Lace (yes, I know, a reference that its evidently intended audience wouldn't have a clue about.)  So, if this is what passes for ""bloody uproarious"" and ""one of the funniest films at Outfest"" then that is a pathetic commentary in and of itself of its devotees.  So, instead of Gilmore Girls, this is just slasher crap repackaged as outr.  Not satire.  Not an intriguing mix of anything.  Ultimately, not funny.  So much potential squandered.",1483142400,2,1037,4.668508287292818
8745908,4,B019R7M2KC,Great black humor!  Enjoyable to watch.,1473811200,,39,5.5
8745909,4,B019R7M2KC,"The first hour of You're Killing Me is borderline brilliant. It's too bad the third act couldn't live up. During the first hour, I was giving this film 5 stars. While the YouTube skits weren't that funny, and could've been taken out, the gore, cute guys, and one awesomely hot male nude scene made up for it. I was more impressed with the horror elements than the comedy. This movie is very bloody, and I liked that.",1471305600,,416,4.415584415584416
