8515261,5,B007EG1MM8,"Paraiso is a wonderful movie that shows a new side of Miami and its Cuban inhabitants. Not a monolithic group of exiles that have been coming to South Florida for 50 years -- but a very diverse humanity. Albeit,these exiles coincide in one thing: the Cuban Revolution changed and mark their lives forever. A great film by Cuban/American filmmaker Leon Ichaso, one of the best directors around, who makes his characters powerful and at the same time vulnerable. Dont miss it.",1341619200,3,474,4.864197530864198
