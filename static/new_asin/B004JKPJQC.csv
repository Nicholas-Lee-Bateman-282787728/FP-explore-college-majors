El precio no esta mal considerando que practicamente solo se consigue en latinoamerica estos videos.",1353888000,2,163,5.269230769230769

8431933,4,B004JKPJQC,"I bought this box-set for my dad's birthday as I knew that he would enjoy the story and because he is also a big fan of Colombian novelas. He only began watching it recently and so far he is enjoying it very much; however, we noticed that there was a problem viewing episode 13 and after multiple tries I figured that it was a manufacturing error as the following episodes were viewed with no problem. My dad was slightly bummed out and I on the other hand was unimpressed considering the price of the box-set and the fact that it makes the makers look slightly bad. If this dvd error is overlooked the quality of the product if very good and hopefully there will be no more issues with any other episodes.",1401926400,,706,4.356060606060606

8431935,5,B004JKPJQC,"I absolutely love this series. It is one that you do not forget ever! I received it within 8 days after I ordered it. It could of been quicker but free shipping was what I wanted ;) It is a little expensive but definitely worth it. Good quality, no subtitles but it is such a great story that it makes up for it.",1396828800,2,312,3.9682539682539684
8431936,4,B004JKPJQC,"There are no subtitles, either in Spanish or English. Would have been nice, especially since there was so much slang, to get the words on the screen. Also, the music got in the way of the dialogue occasionally, so the subtitles would have helped in Spanish. Other than that, this was a great telenovela.",1390780800,,303,4.62962962962963
