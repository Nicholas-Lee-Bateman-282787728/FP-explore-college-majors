5353462,4,B009NI2XVO,"The 2011 documentary FIVE BROKEN CAMERAS comes to us through the lens of Palestinian family man-filmmaker Emad Burnat.  A chronicle of life in Israel-occupied Bil'in in the West Bank, Burnat goes through five movie cameras in six-odd years, each destroyed one by one by occupation forces.

As we see in FIVE BROKEN CAMERAS, Burnat's cameras suffer the least of it compared to human life lost as Palestinians demonstrate against Israeli settlement construction in Bil'in.  This proves a documentary by coincidence, as Burnat only obtains the first of what would be five movie cameras when the youngest of his four children is born in 2005.  But what a coincidence.  When you hear the first words of that youngest child, you have to ask why any should have to grow up in what is essentially an endless war zone.

5353464,1,B009NI2XVO,"Like all pro-Palestinian films on the market, this one focuses on showing emotionally charged images meant only to do one thing: rile viewers against Israel, even if they have no idea what the history and facts surrounding the conflict are about. And that's the problem. The scenes are shown out of context and nothing is explained (let alone in an objective fashion). By the end of the screening, we know only one thing: the Israelis are allegedly ""stealing"" Palestinian land. Why would they do such a terrible thing? We don't know. Are any Israelis interviewed to explain their side of the story? You must be kidding. Why did they build a ""wall"" on ""Palestinian land""? We're not told, although anyone even mildly informed about the Middle East conflict has heard about the wave of Palestinian suicide bombers that came from the West Bank into Israel and killed over 1,000 innocent Israelis, in addition to 3-4,000 maimed for life. That's why there is a security barrier now. The fact that the film producers didn't even bother to explain such a fundamental fact tars the credibility of the rest, which is indeed confirmed later when the ""non-violent protest"" by the Palestinians turns increasingly aggressive and provocative (with foreign activists armed with videocams in tow to film any reaction by impressively stoic Israeli soldiers), culminating in a brutal shower of bricks thrown at a few Israeli army vehicles. If that's non violence, it makes sense to conclude that when they do get violent, the Palestinians turn murderous, which explains in turn the security measures this type of aggressive behavior has forced Israel to take. A fine propaganda piece this is. A fair and balanced documentary? Not a chance. I suspect the people who will flock to watch this movie will do so not because they want to learn more about the conflict (they would be hard-pressed to find any reliable information in there anyway) as much as they'll want to watch material that will feed their pre-existing prejudices, if not outright hatred. This film contributes nothing to building bridges, on the contrary. All it does is fan the flames of hate. Not much to be proud of.",1359417600,31,2164,4.947802197802198

5353472,4,B009NI2XVO,"Before I say another word let me say that I am a Jew by upbringing and not an anti-semite. I found this film extremely disturbing even though I was aware of the settlement issue and the steady encroachment upon Arab land by Israelis. Seeing it visually play out however, left me with a feeling of revulsion and anger. I have written in other reviews of films dealing with the Israeli/Palestinian conflict that the Jews that came to Palestine following WWII had the same attitude toward the Palestinians as other Europeans had toward indigenous peoples wherever they encountered them in all the years of exploration and conquest: We are the superior people; we have the culture, art, technology, science, and GOD ON OUR SIDE. You are in our way. So they came, they saw, they grabbed and kept grabbing. Creating a safe haven for Jews in the so-called Holy Land following the devastation of the Holocaust SEEMED like a good idea but was it? Safety while surrounded by people you despise, discount, and whose land you grab and lifestyle you destroy? Who would have thought that the descendants of Jews victimized by the Nazis would be victimizing others two generations later?! Israel you have played the victim card long enough - it no longer applies. While there is not enough water in all the oceans to wash away the pain of the Holocaust, there is also no justification on earth for one group of people to condemn another to the slow death of apartheid. And while I don't condone Palestinian terror, its easy to see where it comes from. Israel will always be a thorn in the side of the Arab world but the endless occupation will fuel an endless intifada. And the brutal land grabbing to provide housing for arrogant, self-righteous, religious fanatics - yarmulke wearing drones incapable of an original thought will keep the hate going forever. I believe films like this will eventually turn the tide of opinion of even the brainwashed American public but by then the Palestinians will have gone the way of the American Indian - a people destroyed, demoralized - a footnote in history.",1470528000,4,2085,4.794444444444444

5353476,5,B009NI2XVO,"Deeply affecting document of Palestinian mistreatment at the hands of Israeli settlers and soldiers as the small village of Bilni is slowly co-opted and taken away from its long time residents.  The film follows the years 2005 to 2010 during which film-maker Burnat evolves from farmer to obsessive documenter of his towns struggles.  During that time, 5 of his camera are destroyed in the protests, giving the film its title.

What gives the film its power is how simple and personal it is.  Burnat is no stylist, hes just trying to capture the mistreatment his family, his village, himself have suffered - so the world can see what is happening.  We get to know others who we see arrested or beaten or even killed on camera.  This isn't a documentary about an objective view, or politics in the big picture.  Whatever you think about the bigger issues in the Arab-Israeli conflict (I believe there's a lot of blame to go around on both sides, as well as a lot of people of good intent) , theres no question that this particular group of unarmed protesters being repeatedly greeted with tear gas, rubber bullets and ultimately even live ammunition is an unforgivable abuse of human rights, and is forming very human scars that will infect the next generation for years to come.",1462233600,4,1278,4.755656108597285

5353480,3,B009NI2XVO,"""5 Broken Cameras"" is an award-winning video documentary by Emad Burnat, a West Bank Palestinian.  A compulsive videographer, he gets his hard-to-replace cameras serially broken at successive demonstrations opposing harsh Israeli occupation.  In between documenting the violence, Burnat records himself in his home setting, talking thoughtfully with his family and friends.  Playing to the camera, he gradually educates the viewer to his understanding of the situation in which West Bank Palestinians find themselves.  He also indoctrinates, then involves, his children in the bloody protests, thus helping perpetuate the cycle of violence, i.e., Demonstration, Provocation, Retaliation, which foments fresh grievances for the next demonstration (reference: see the Palestinian demonstration videos on YouTube. Com).

In demonstration-after-demonstration, all Palestinian provocations toward Israeli military/police personnel go unrecorded, but each bloody aftermath is faithfully captured.  I waited for other voices to be heard, but this was not to be.  Instead of attempting to ""win the hearts and minds"" of Burnat's declared oppressors, he plays mainly to those already sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.  His grievance is valid, but his film could have been more morally compelling if he gave articulation to both sides of the conflict.  Regardless of who makes a documentary on whatever topic, omissions give the perception that one has something untidy to hide.  In spite of having won several accolades, Burnat's film missed the mark.",1445040000,2,1545,5.887892376681615

I could not grasp this idea because growing up in America we were told certain things about these 2 groups of people and the documentary was showing exactly the opposite. My brain just did not accept it! I had never seen actually video footage of Israeli's or Palestinians before so I did not know what it looked like there.  I had no idea that the Palestinians lived like this. I still don't know if it was a real documentary. I am hoping it is not. I am totally mind blown.

5353543,1,B009NI2XVO,"This film is actually a testament to the highest levels of humanity and mercy, made manifest in this world today by THE STATE of ISRAEL.

1. THERE IS A FENCE.......
`
After thousands of Israeli civilians are killed or injured by Palestinian terrorist suicide bombers coming from the West Bank and Gaza, Israel builds a FENCE. This is a non-violent response that serves to separate the ruthless from the vulnerable. As a response to mass murder, building a fence is an act of restraint and humanity.

2. ISRAELI SOLDIERS FIRE RUBBER BULLETS AND TEAR GAS......

As hundreds of IDF personnel are injured in and around Bil'in by rioting Palestinians throwing rocks and firebombs. Using only crowd control weapons with non-lethal intent, IDF soldiers continue to show admirable restraint and stoicism after years of weekly, face-to-face provocation and incitement, as demonstrations by Arab villagers and foreign activists sometimes turn into riots and the fence has been repeatedly damaged.

3.  ISRAELI SOLDIERS PERMIT ARAB VILLAGERS ACCESS THROUGH THE FENCE 10 HOURS A DAY, DAY IN AND OUT as ISRAELI LAWYERS TAKE UP THE CASE OF NON-ISRAELI ARABS. Why? Because they are bending over backwards to be fair.

  4. THE FENCE IS MOVED.....

After Israel's Supreme Court shows incredible largesse by granting due process to Arab non-citizens who are under the civil jurisdiction of the PA, which has yet to formally recognize its very legitimacy, and hears their petition. The court's 22-page document from their 2007 hearing can be read here:[...] In it, the justices consider in detail the conflicting appeals of Palestinian villagers, Israeli military officials, and real estate developers over the legality of this barrier, which is upheld, and the legality of its particular route through uninhabited land, which is not. Of note, the Israeli real estate developers who claim to have bought the land West of the fence from local villagers would not provide documentation of the transaction, as doing so would imperil the lives of Arabs for having sold land to Jews.

These aforementioned actions on the part of Israel, its citizens and institutions, are the epitome of civilized behavior and a shining example of the rule of law in a liberal democracy.

As Americans, we know well the story of the Holocaust of WWII which killed so many Jews, Gypsies and others simply because of who they were. We have supported a homeland for Jews in Israel with our money (US aid especially) and our well wishes. We have defined anyone who opposes Israel as terrorists to the point that we often do not allow even the Israelis to be self-critical (and as I read their opinions in Haaretz, they are). There is another narrative from the Holy Land alongside the narrative of the Jewish people -- Palestinian people live there and have been there for 100's or even 1000's of years. In the time of Abraham, he made a covenant (agreement of peaceful co-existence) with Abimelech, who lived in the region of the Philistines (Gaza today). Living side by side is an old as Abraham and justice for all the people is as old as the Torah (Deut 1:16-17). This story graphically shows the struggle of the Palestinian people. According to a recent article in the Israeli News Haaretz, Israel now occupies 86% of the land that was designated for the Palestinians. Again, according to Haaretz, there are 5.9 million Israelis and 6.1 million Palestinians living in the area that is Israel and the occupied territories (Palestine).

In summary: the filmmaker, who is a Palestinian living in the West Bank, gets a camera. He uses it to record his new son and their lives. The year is 2005, and Israel is actively creating settlements in the West Bank. The filmmaker, his family, friends, and everyone in his region protest those settlements being created in their region. For the most part, their protests are peaceful, and the Israeli response it the exact opposite. The filmmaker captures these events, as well as the impact they have on his family and son. It is a powerful message to foreign audiences that there is peaceful protest happening in the West Bank. It presents a previously unrepresented Palestinian point of view - the non-terrorist, the ordinary man.

I was lucky enough to see a screening of this at a film festival. The filmmaker was in attendance, as were his son and wife. He spoke openly about the film, explaining that he does not consider himself a filmmaker. He's just a man with a camera, documenting his life. He talked about how Hamas is in his village, yet the people chose to protest peacefully - that everyone is capable of it. And, he talked about screening the film in Israel.

It is only at second glance that we see that they are cameras. Broken, twisted, cameras. Each is different, each is mangled, each is broken, and each have captured an incredible story of oppression, conflict, and indomitable spirit. These 5 broken cameras have filmed the most important and relevant documentary of 2012.

Bil'in is an ancient and peaceful rural Israeli town where the kids play in the olive orchards, and the fathers work in the orange groves and the olive trees. They live a simple life, a hard life, a life of contentment.

Then the bulldozers came. And with them: soldiers, machine guns, tanks, barbed wire, and gas grenades. The peace of Bil'in is shattered. Fences are raised, barriers, checkpoints, patrols, raids. The people of Bil'in begin peaceful protests against this clearly illegal and unjustifiable act of oppression. Violence mounts, arrests, beatings, shootings, gassings, vandalism, and midnight raids are carried out.

And through all of this, Emad Burnat is watching, behind a camera. His cameras captures acts of brutality and cruelty, acts of hope and humanity, acts of violence and peace, acts of death and life. A theme through the film is his young son growing up. The audience is made uncomfortable when they realize that all this turmoil is virtually being seen through the eye of a child.

5 Broken Cameras is a gripping account of the ongoing turmoil in Palestine. It will make you laugh, cry, angry, amazed, and most of all, it will make you want to make a difference.

1.  That Israel is occupying Arab land.
2.  That there is a Palestinian Arab People that was not invented by Soviet dezinformatsia in 1964.
3.  That the ownership of the political rights to Palestine was not recognized as belonging to the Jews in 1920 by the Allies at San Remo, confirmed by the League of Nations in 1922 and by the Anglo American convention in 1924.
4.  That the political rights to Palestine were not ceded by its former sovereign Turkey to England, as the ""Mandatory Power"" in trust for World Jewry lin the Treaty of Sevres, and confirmed sub silentio in the Treaty of Lausanne.
5.  That Arabs living in. Palestine have not used threats of violence and actual violence since 1920 to extort these rights from the Jews to which they belong under International Law.
6.  That the liberation of the so called ""occupied area"" and its administration by Jews after 1967 was not a catastrophe for the Arabs but was of great benefit to them, because
  a. Life expectancy increased from 48 to 82,
  b. Infant mortality deceased by 75%,
  c. Employment increased significantly,
  d. Average income increased significantly, more than in adjacent Arab states.
  e. Per capital GDP increased significantly, more than in adjacent Arab states except for those with oil income.
  f. The number of Arab houses with running water increased significantly,
  g. The number of Arab houses with electricity increased significantly,
  h. The number of Arab homes cooking with electricity and gas increased significantly
  i.  Before the Israeli liberation, the number of colleges or universities was zero, afterwards seven.
  j.. Literacy increased significantly.
  k. After Oslo, these benefits started to decline.
These are all facts that are available to those who are willing to dig for them.  To those who just want to watch a film, they remain obscured by time and by the propaganda of the Soviet Union and the Arabs with all the resources they need to disseminate these views from petrodollars you contribute to them when you buy gasoline.

5353572,4,B009NI2XVO,"As a strong supporter of Israel, I was expecting a boring and dishonest presentation, but it actually was much more interesting than that. Yes, there are scenes of Palestinian Arab protesters being confronted by Israeli soldiers and settlers, and the film is obviously and explicitly sympathetic to the protesters. Yet the very existence of this film, the fact that the soldiers repeatedly allow the filming often just a few feet away, vindicates Israel's status as the only true Middle Eastern democracy that respects freedom of speech and press.

The filmmaker explains that he bought a video camera in 2005 because of the birth of his youngest son and then began recording local events for his fellow villagers in Bil'in, a small suburb of Ramallah with a population of about 1800. That birth coincided with the filing of a lawsuit in the Israeli courts challenging the route of the separation barrier that would have cut off the villagers from their olive trees, leading to weekly demonstrations protesting the barrier. The villagers win their lawsuit in 2007 and the Israeli Army moves the barrier in 2011. That is the bare outline of the story.

What is striking about life in Bil'in in the sheer ordinariness of it: conditions are hardly pleasant and the economy is in shambles, but people have food and cars and houses with electricity and television. The protesters, who theoretically espouse non-violence, engage in a dangerous cat-and-mouse game with the soldiers assigned to protect the barrier, and there are occasionally injuries from rubber bullets and tear gas canisters, sometimes to people and sometimes to cameras.

The unusual symbiotic relationship between the protesters and the soldiers reaches its climax, ironically, when the filmmaker accidentally crashes his car into the barrier while apparently distracted by operating his camera. He is so seriously injured that the soldiers rush him in a military vehicle to Tel HaShomer Hospital, the largest and best hospital in Israel; he openly admits in his narration that he almost certainly would have died had the soldiers not done this and he had instead been taken to a Palestinian Arab hospital. He comments cynically that he has a big bill from the hospital because neither the Israeli government nor the Palestinian Authority are willing to pay, the Israeli government because he is not a citizen of Israel and the Palestinian Authority because his injuries were not a result of fighting Israel.

Disappointingly, the film ends with what is, in my opinion, a scene that degenerates into its only baldly jingoistic set-piece: on the filmmaker's final visit for medical treatment at the hospital in Tel Aviv, he is accompanied by his two youngest sons and they go for an outing to the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Given that Palestinian Arab schools typically teach using maps that eliminate the State of Israel and show instead a fantasy of a Palestinian Arab state in its place stretching all the way to the Mediterranean Sea, the scene of the two boys splashing around playfully on the beach will be understood by Palestinian Arab audiences as a subtle yet unambiguous message suggesting the possibility of a future where the State of Israel does not exist. While the film never explicitly expresses that view, encouraging it even tacitly does a grave disservice to the cause of peace.

In the end, this is a remarkable film for both its content and its existence. The villagers win not from violence, but from a favorable ruling from the Israeli courts. The soldiers ordered to prevent the protesters from reaching the barrier allow themselves to be filmed for years, and eventually save the life of the filmmaker. Ultimately, though, it is a personal record of living through a conflict while maintaining as ordinary a life as possible.",1362528000,3,3819,5.0651828298887125

5353574,5,B009NI2XVO,"Emad Burnat captures so clearly the struggles of Palestinians in peacefully protesting Israeli occupation. If one is unfamiliar with the extent to which the Israeli government  through its military is relentless in destroying Palestinian lives, this film brings to light what Palestinians undergo daily. In viewing this film, one can't help but reminisce the US civil rights movement against US apartheid as well as South African blacks peacefully protesting against apartheid.  This film is effective in bringing to light what mainstream media refuse to cover. Burnat's film is another of recent films that break the silence on Israel's brutal treatment of the Palestinians.  One of those films is the outstanding, historical documentary ""Road Map to Apartheid,"" which draws extraordinary parallels between Israeli and South African apartheid. This is a film worth adding to your archive of documentaries.",1362528000,6,906,5.598540145985401
5353575,5,B009NI2XVO,"Of course this documentary is made solely from a palestine perspective. That taken in account, it is still one of the strongest most upsetting documentaries I have seen. It bluntly pictures the way the palestine people is oppressed by Israel and captures some appalling criminal acts that the Israeli soldiers are committing (for instance, an arrested palestinian with handcuffs is put beside a army car whereafter a soldier slowly aims and shoots him in the leg at point blank). Clearly this is one side of the story, but much of what you see in the documentary must be extremely hard for the Israelies to defend. The argument that Israel must build a defence wall to protect themselves from suicidebombers and rockets doesn't explain why they consequently move into palestinian land, bulldoze their property and build apartment complexes there. I mean, if the area is so dangerous that it must be temporarily occupied - why do Israel build apartments there?!

In these times, when everyone has a camera and can connect to the internet, it will be much harder for oppressors like Israel to continue their activities without the world knowing. Please note that I don't defend terrorism against Israel and realise that Israel is indeed having a lot of security issues that needs to be dealt with. But even with that taken into account, it is extremely hard to see how Israels activities on Palestinian land can be justified at all. And this film is a very explicit document in the rightful critique against Israel.",1362268800,6,1513,4.933333333333334

5353579,5,B009NI2XVO,Non-violent resistance in the occupied West Bank is a dangerous endeavour. The rain of tear gas canisters that is shot at the demonstrators during their Friday protests makes the viewer duck. As viewers we also look over the shoulders of the villagers from Bil'in as they try talking to heavily armed occupation soldiers. Anyone who has only read about the Israeli occupation in main stream media will get a dose of the raw violence and the arrogance of Israel's treatment of Palestinians there.

8543092,5,B009NI2XVO,"An excellent film about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the point of view of a Palestinian farmer whose village has had land stolen for a nearby settlement. Multiply that many times and you will understand the central role of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank in the conflict today. Israeli settlers will not admit they are stealing the Palestinian land. They will say that this is historical Jewish land promised to them by God. They have an entire army to protect them and back them up. It's shocking to see Israeli soldiers repeatedly shoot and kill Palestinians who are engaged in peaceful protest that would be protected free speech in developed Western countries. The narrator has a simple, poetic style of speaking that greatly helps this documentary. It is worth noticing that much of the film takes place in the land of men, among men, with few women in the public spaces you see, most of them foreign women who are among the supporters of the Palestinians, and some of the supporters are Israelis. I couldn't watch this film in one sitting. I watched it over four or five viewings. It is too disturbing to watch at once. If you want to know more about this at the end, you might wish to read ""The Lords of the Land,"" the history of the Israeli settler movement in the West Bank.",1491004800,5,1300,4.656521739130435
8543093,5,B009NI2XVO,Great movie. I really helped me to understand the Palestinian plight. One reviewer suggested that this movie was bad because it had no background. I suspect the more background could have provided would only make the Israeli IDF look worse. This movie gives perspective to what had been missing in the American media. The human rights abuse that occurs on a daily basis against the Palestinians. Illegal settlements on Palestinian land creates an Apartheid state in which Israel is the aggressor. This goes to the core conflict in Israel. This is a powerful movie that every American needs to see.
