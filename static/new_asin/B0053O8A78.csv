4537548,5,B0053O8A78,"The wit, intelligence and superb delivery of each 30 Rock never fails to make me laugh, entertain me, and tell me a story on several levels.  What a great ensemble, what fantastic writing, and all squeezed in less tha 30 minutes.  There is so much packed into each episode that I have to watch several times to pick up on some of the deliveries.  30 Rock is a formidable competitor to reality TV as it's a slice of the old formulae sit-com that doesn't pander, doesn't treat it's viewers as couch potatoes and stays pithy and relative to todays world.  If you love TV in it's future incarnation, have loved it for the decades of it's past incarnations, and really want to see where television should someday be, 30 Rock is it.  Don't miss an episode.  Prepare to laugh, think, and love TV without guilt again.  This is it.",1348185600,,822,4.476510067114094

4537550,5,B0053O8A78,"Since the NBC Press Release was very vague about the extras on this Season 6 DVD Set, I just wanted to quickly write them down for you. Included is:

- Audiocomentary on ""Dance Like Nobody's Watching"" by writer Tracey Wigfield and writer/producer Tom Ceraulo
- Audiocomentary on ""Alexis Goodlooking and the case of the Missing Whisky"" by Judah Friedlander
- Audiocomentary on ""Standards and Practices"" by Jack McBrayer
- Audiocomentary on ""Live from Studio 6H"" by Jane Krakowski and composer/producer Jeff Richmond
- West Coast Version of the Live Show (23:23 min)
- Behind the Scenes of ""Live from Studio 6H"" (7:24 min)
- Warm up Featurette before the Live Show (8:42 min)
- Deleted Scenes

As you can see they have cut down the number of Audiocomentaries immensely, as there used to be up to 10 per Season Set. And again there is no gag reel, which is something I would so love to see from a show like this. Also, I wished there were more interviews with cast and crew.

Overall this was a great season. It amazes me how this show manages to stay fresh after 6 years. Nothing feels worn out, actually to the contrary they manage to bring in new elements and going back to some of the core storylines of the show. I loved the addition of James Marsden as Liz's new boyfriend Criss. The writers managed to create a loveable character and actually used him in a good way throughout the Season, giving Liz and Criss a possible happy ending for the upcoming final and seventh season. I also loved this years Live Episode and Queen of Jordan Episode. I also need to mention Jenna, for whom the writers really stepped up their, already high, game. Her remarks and storylines were really a highlight of the Season for me, especially in the beginning.

All in all I highly recommend the sixth season of 30 Rock, although I wished they put more effort into the DVD Extras.",1346371200,24,1864,4.588588588588588

Sherri Shepard is great as Tracy's wife, but the ""Queen of Jordan"" subplot and its added cast wears thin real fast. Otherwise, the laughs pretty much move along as well as the previous seasons.

The writing is clever and there's just so much of the wacky and hilarious in this ongoing story of the colorful characters on The Girlie Show at NBC.  The characters are so blatant and honest about themselves - there's no beating around the bush - the obvious imperfections of these people are out there, but somehow we  as viewers of the show just love them more!  I have a hard time watching ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" because I just can't stand how the characters are self-absorbed and plain stupid.  I thoroughly enjoy ""30 Rock"" because at least most of the characters have redeeming qualities about them.

4537744,1,B0053O8A78,"I tried to like this show but its characters just don't ring true.  I watched a few episodes in the early years and would occasionally be slightly amused by one of the supporting characters.  Recently, I was stuck in a cabin on a rainy weekend and had to sit through all of Season Six on DVD.  At the end of this marathon of bad TV, my friend who brought the DVD set with us told me that she wished she could return it because she will never watch it again.  30 Rock has gone from merely being schedule filler that ranged from okay to not-so-great during its first few seasons to now being awful.  I wish it were possible to give this DVD set negative stars.

If you are going to buy this DVD set, please be sure to watch a few episodes of Season Six on reruns and know in advance what you are buying.",1376870400,,801,4.102564102564102

All I'm saying is that you can only do so much with those characters before it becomes less funny. I can see why Season 7 is the end of the series.

4537873,1,B0053O8A78,"First, the positive. Baldwin was OUTSTANDING in the live episode and the Hazel character is a very good fit/counter with most characters. Throughout the season, Baldwin has been the most consistently funny even though you can tell he's working with very difficult material at times.

Now, the bad. I've seen every episode of every season and like most up until season 6. There are big changes that have changed the character and quality of the show.

First, there are too many jokes. I know that sounds counter to the goal of a comedy show but we're getting quantity over quality. Good jokes aren't given time to breathe and comedic timing has been off with many of the actors stepping over one another's lines. It's as though the actors are more concerned with plowing through a string of jokes than reacting to jokes and allowing the lines to be heard and sink in.

Second, there is too much focus on trivial characters. I like Lutz as a punching bag but a whole episode dedicated to making him feel like part of a group?

Third, too much catharsis. It seems this season saw a lot of stories trying to wrap up by the end of the episode with some big character change that was completely unnecessary. It felt forced.

Four, too much suspension of disbelief. The writers have fallen back on stereotypes rather than good story lines about flawed but real humans. Several absurd things happen and rather than react in disbelief the characters become a part of it to the point of not being human. Every character is guilty of that this season but the biggest offenders are Tracy and Jenna. Even a fool has some level of sensibility. When the writers sacrifice or not consider that for the sake of scripted jokes then the character's contribution fails because we don't expect anything normal to balance the abnormal with. What would be so funny about Tracy Jordan walking around with a fish in his ear? Nothing because we expect him to do it.

It seems as if all thought process that would make a character believable has been completely thrown out to focus on the stereotype instead. For example, we all know Kenneth is a 'dumb hick', but his biggest moments in the past were where in spite of this he seemed to gain the upper hand. Here the joke 'Kenneth is a dumb hick' is the only punchline and it is made repeatedly. I liken this to the last season of Seinfeld where absurdism reigned over reality (i.e. would Kramer REALLY have had a TV show set in his living room and would his friends REALLY just go along with it?).

Five, too much political agenda. I felt like I could hear special interest groups saying, 'don't forget to include a nice little positive thing about us... for laughs.' Stories seemed to suffer for something entirely unnecessary to the comedy.

I am a fan of the show. As I said, I've seen every episode and love the show up until this season. I know this cast is capable of very funny work but bad writing isn't going to get them anywhere. The writers need to step back, put these characters back on Earth, stop worrying about fan expectations (i.e. 'get Jack and Liz together', 'Be nice to Lutz', 'Say something funny about our special group') and stop relying on character stereotypes as the sole source of humor. If you can't do that then perhaps it is time to pull the plug.",1353974400,11,3302,4.575296108291032

4537879,5,B0053O8A78,30 Rock is one of the best shows on TV. This is the only season I have purchased because it is HILARIOUS!,1350950400,,105,3.8181818181818183
4537880,5,B0053O8A78,"It never fails. I'll find a new show that I just love and it'll go flat in 2 seasons. That is not the case with 30 Rock! It has been consistently top notch every season. Season 6 is no different as it keeps you laughing. Every time I hear a Mickey Rouke joke from Jenna, I laugh out loud just thinking of all he's done to her over the years! Clever writing and wacky humor make this one of the best comedies on TV now, in my opinion. I will be sad to see it end but I do feel like its a show I can go back to every couple months.",1350172800,2,529,3.732142857142857
