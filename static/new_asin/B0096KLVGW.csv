8536727,5,B0096KLVGW,"THIS IS GREAT I LOVE IT and very convenient for my car keys, yes. Some people are cut off though. From top to bottom, this lanyard has cut off; Marluxia, Lexaeus, Namine, and Goofy. you can only see half of them, or parts of their hair/face. everyone else you can see fairly well. All my favorites are perfectly visible, so i have no complaints about that. No Aqua or Terra, sadly, and almost half of the Organization is missing. Which weren't expected, because really, how many people can you fit on a gosh dang lanyard

ALSO you should know that the mickey key comes attached to the hook, instead of the phone charm-string... thing. So if you want it to look the way it does in the picture, you'll have to un-hook it and then reattach it to the string yourself. I just put it on a separate key chain.",1369008000,,802,4.346666666666667

8536729,5,B0096KLVGW,"I'm a big fan and I love the King Mickey key but it did break after 3 weeks. still have the lanyard I have my keys on it is awesome, but I do wish I still had the King Mickey keyblade :/",1361836800,,186,3.4523809523809526
8536730,5,B0096KLVGW,"Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend to use for his id at work. It's really well made and the images look great! Definitely not cheap looking. The little Mickey key charm wasn't attached when I got it, but it was really easy to reattach (or remove if you don't want it on). If you're a KH fan I think you'll love this!",1359590400,,320,4.015625
