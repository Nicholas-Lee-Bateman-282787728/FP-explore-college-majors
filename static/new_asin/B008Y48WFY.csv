8532386,5,B008Y48WFY,"I just wanted to Rate it with stars but Amazon makes write me wtite a review so I will just ""babble"" along just to get enough characters so my 5 Star Rating will go through. but honestly a creepy well made movie from the wonderful seventies when nothing was digitally enhanced what you see is what you get and it's beautiful. Great movie. In my 95th percentile of all movies I've ever watched.",1423612800,2,393,4.397260273972603
8532387,2,B008Y48WFY,"Lindsay (Mary Charlotte Wilcox) has a dead daddy issue which manifests itself with her attending funerals so she can give the young male corpse a long kiss. She is found our by a cult of necrophiliacs who for some reason wear hooded robes like a satanic cult. She also marries Lyle Waggoner which really doesn't work out because he wants to be on top and move and stuff.

That is pretty much it. Add some Mary Wilcox nudity, including some male nudity

Well preserved for a 1972 film. Most likely because they didn't show it much. Not too many extras.",1402617600,,551,4.5
8532388,3,B008Y48WFY,"A frigid woman who likes funerals and is turned on only by dead bodies enters into a sexless marriage with CAROL BURNETT SHOW bud Lyle Waggoner and secretly joins a cult of necrophiliacs in a local morgue. For a film that had so much perverse and ghoulish potential, this film only partially entertains. There's a particularly shocking scene early in the film of a guy being embalmed alive but the film gets bogged down in the drama of marital problems in the second hour. While the serious approach to such outrageous material is greatly appreciated, a little more ghoulish horror would've been nice.",1391040000,,601,4.844660194174757
