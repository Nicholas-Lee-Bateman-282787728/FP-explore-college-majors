2877326,5,B000RZIGVI,"Praised for its quality and famous for its drama, The Untouchables (1959-1963) roared like the decade it portrayed in grand theatrical style. It was epic, unique, and violent as it brought to life the nightly wars between good and evil in the streets of Prohibition Chicago.

With legendary law man Eliot Ness (Robert Stack) and his band of incorruptible federal agents leading the way for justice, famed reporter Walter Winchell providing staccato narration, and guest stars breathing life into colorful underworld characters, the true story of The Untouchables has become legend in a film noir mix of true history and Emmy award winning television fiction...

This set presents the latter half of the first season, as the series begins to mature and find out what works and what doesn't.

The writing gets tighter, the characters get more colorful, Ness loses a man or two, and the stage is set for enthralling second season.

Check out ""The Unhired Assasin,"" ""One Armed Bandits,"" ""The Noise of Death,"" ""3000 Suspects"" (with Leslie Nielson in a straight role!) and ""The Frank Nitti Story"" as highlights from Season 1.

Season 1, Volume 2 includes ""The Lucy Show: Lucy the Gun Moll"" as a special feature. Seeing Robert Stack, Bruce Gordon, Steve London, and even Walter Winchell sending up their old rolls is worth the price of the set alone.",1189728000,16,1343,4.977678571428571

2877328,5,B000RZIGVI,"After getting the first volume, I was more than pleased with it.  The stories are fun thoughtful and action packed.  These are tales of bad guys, I mean bad guys who face off with the Untouchables.  Good guys who could not be bought.  I will be the first to admit that we are not talking history here, but you get the feel of an era in American history.  Prohibition and bathtub gin, mobsters and molls.  Put a great dramatic and action filled story together and frame it with narration by Walter Winchell and you get classic entertainment.",1184630400,32,540,4.515463917525773
2877329,5,B000RZIGVI,"Retro television shows have never done particularly well unless they were set in the Old West. Shows set in the 20's, 30's, 40's, etc, any era outside of the one in which they aired have never lasted long except in three major exceptions - Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, and The Untouchables.

The Untouchables succeeded for a number of reasons. First, the veil that had been on the Mafia for a number of years was slowly but surely being peeled off due to gangland killings and the fame of gangsters such as Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, Dutch Schultz, Lucky Luciano, and others. Even before the Godfather and its outstanding first sequel, the public had a fascination and curiosity with the mob. So take some true events, ture characters, heavily fictionalize them with Hollywood gloss and pathos, and you get a very successful show that made a star out of Robert Stack and brought new fame to a Treasury agent named Eliot Ness.

The Untouchables' First Season collection should not have been split up into multiple sections. That's greed, pure and simple. But the lure of this show - its great characters, performances, grit and intelligence will draw buyers even though they know they're being ripped off. Stack's Ness is one of the best alltime detectives - fearless, relentless, and absolutely ruthless with the bad guys. The supporting casts were always excellent, and Bruce Gordon brough the right amount of humor and menace to Frank Nitti, Capone's chief lieutenant.

The Untouchables - Season One, Volume 2 is not untouchable, but it is irresistable.",1183593600,41,1555,4.927480916030534

2877340,5,B000RZIGVI,"The best story is the 2 part Big Train episode relating Al Capones transfer from Atlanta to the newly opened Alcatraz prison. It details the escape plan.

The best thing about this faux history of organized crime is to get you to look up the real history of the characters and events. Hollywood took real license to make the series more dramatic and action-oriented. But it is enjoyable entertainment if you are not one of the anti-gun crowd. If anything, the series shows that when guns are banned, only criminals will have guns. And not the type that you register.

The character of the individuals portrayed span the spectrum from evil to good. From that perspective, the whole gauntlet of human relations and motivations are laid bare. That may come as a big shock to those who think that rhetoric solves problems.",1451865600,,818,4.753521126760563

 And ever since he left high school
 His dad saw him one day being a tycoon
 Now a girl but a woman had an interest in him
 Could she destroy the plans that were laid out for him?
 And hes daydreaming
 About honeymoons and vacations in Lisbon
 So he quits his job and never looked back
 Had a heated discussion with his mom who gave him a slap
 She kicked him out and where did he go and live?
 With the lady who nowadays gives him lip
 But still he stayed
 Cause as long as he had a chick he was happy in his grave
 Although tensions and life got too much
 Became a regular at Locust Bar
 Once a social dude and now all alone
 No car so he had to walk home
 Same clothes everyday
 Same ho everyday
 But he chose this life so hey?",1430870400,,773,3.870967741935484

There's a lot of great talent in this program, amny actors who would be seen later in other popular TV shows in the 1960s. Elizabeth Montgomery made an appearance in one episode as a gangster's mistress. Also, this volume includes The Big Train, a two-part episode about a plot to free Capone while he was being moved from a federal prison in Atlanta to Alcatraz. This is the only episode I have seen so far which includes a disclaimer, stating that prison guards are not reall as corrupt as portrayed in the show.

This is the second DVD set in the Untouchables series. Despite being in black and white (or maybe because of it) the show has an impact with the viewers as they follow Eliot Ness and his special team of federal agents as they pursue the gangsters who came to power thanks to prohibition. Robert Stack puts on a great performance, as do the supporting cast. Watching the series one show at a time in a short period of time does make it noticeable that they used some of the same stock footage (when flying, for instance) or make use of shots from previous shows. However, for good, old-fashioned police drama you can't beat the Untouchables. I wasn't going to watch the bonus episode of the Lucy Show but it turned out to be an excellent parody of the Untouchables, having Robert Stack and the actor who played Frank Nitti in it.

Unlike today there wasn't 12 episodes or so to a season. Usually there were around 30 which makes the sets even better, a lot more to enjoy for the price. The show came on the air just two years after the deeath of the real Eliot Ness who was portrayed by Robert Stack. Stack had a very unemotional style to his acting which in this case was appropriate considering some of the low lifes he encountered. I was particularly pleased in a two part episode rntitled ""The Unhired Assasin"" which I actually remembered from that time. It was an envolved story and much deeper than the usual shows which ran less than an hour without the commercials. The show was produced by Desilu, a company owned by Desi Arnez abd his wife Lucille Ball. It is a violent show, but less so than most everything else on television or movies today. In an age of virtually unlimited westerns, ""The Untouchables"" are still real classics.",1299110400,3,1075,4.604166666666667

Stack, an excellent actor, was obliged to play the humorless, unsmiling and righteous Ness and was perfect and made his character believable. The show is narrated by Walter Winchell, giving the episodes a documentary flavor that gives each drama an air of tension along with the edgy theme music and artwork that tied in nicely with each weekly program. The two CDs in this set cover the show's debut in 1959 and run through 1960 and have probably the best of the Untouchables episodes.

2877446,5,B000RZIGVI,"Still holds up well after 50 years - one of the greatest TV shows ever featuring compelling performances by Robert Stack, who is an excellent Elliot Ness and an extremely under-rated actor (Stack is simply brilliant in everything I've seen him in and this is no exception). The Untouchables is THE gangster TV show set in Prohibition America. A fine cast of regulars and many guest stars of high calibre, this show was one of the first with a docu-drama approach that really intensifies the action and plot of each episode. If you thought The Sopranos and The Wire were the beginning of televised corporate crime, look again - it all started here first on THE UNTOUCHABLES with Frank Nitti (the successor to Al Capone when he was jailed) and the very start of organised crime.",1264723200,8,776,4.713235294117647
2877447,5,B000RZIGVI,"In Season Two an example of one of the many powerful dramas is the story called ""Augie 'the Banker' Ciamino"".  Focusing on a new immigrant family named Raineri, an aging father living with his son who has a wife and young daughter. The father owns a small bakery, while his son is a bookkeeper. Ciamino is a Syndicate leader who heads illegal whisky distillation, forcing small immgrant familes to make bootleg whisky in their homes and carry it to his facility in root beer bottles. The father sees the horror going on around him as any of his neighbors who tries to resist Ciamino is brutally beaten or murdered. He suspects his own son is mixed up in it somehow as his son brings home records and books that he locks up in a cabinet at night. He begs his son to quit whatever he's involved in, and they have quite a heated argument over it with his son insisting he's only a bookkeeper. Eventually the father discovers it's true. His son works for Ciamino keeping records of his criminal enterprise. He calls his son while his son is in the presence of Ciamino and his thug hitman and tells him over the phone that he is taking those record books to Elliot Ness. Well, the bad guys overhear what was said and force him to tell his father to wait , that he'll be right over to go with him to Ness, but in reality the crooks are going with him to kill his father, and he knows it. In a heartbreaking scene he saves his father at the cost of his own life, but then it's a desperate run as his father tries to weave his way through the back alleys of chicago looking for someone who can help him get to the police while clutching ledgers and records that could indict Ciamino and put him away for good, Ciamino's hired killers chasing him every step of the way.  As in many of the episodes, the story is less about Elliot Ness fighting criminals and more about the struggle and drama of the individuals and families fighting to preserve themselves against brutal criminals.

Season two of The Untouchables is powerful stuff.  It's every bit as intense and dramatic as season one, maybe even more so. Love the season opener with Elizabeth Montgomery ( Samantha Stephens from Bewitched ) as a beautiful nightclub showgirl plotting one mobster against another for her own profit. Even tough guy Elliot Ness seems to melt just a little under her stunning gaze. There's a scene with both of them standing together in the fog at the docks, and with a smile and a look in her eyes that would melt the arctic glaciers she invites him for a weekend alone with her in the mountains. There's a long pause before he answers, and we might be forgiven for thinking that the clean-cut married man, super good-guy Ness, actually pondered it in his head for a moment before saying ""Sorry, I can't"". Some of the hottest women ever to grace the television screen of any era show up in this series. I have to recommend that you buy this set of disks.  Also, I notice some other people have stated that they don't like the editing of the fade-outs where commercials would normally have appeared.  Frankly I have no idea what they are talking about. I can't find anything thing wrong with this set. The editing looks fine to me and the stories are presented in full. Everything looks great.  The disks are in great condition and the video and audio are sharp and clear. Totally enjoyable.

2877448,5,B000RZIGVI,WATCHING THIS SERIES WAS LIKE WATCHING A MOVIE IN THE THEATRE. MY KID'S WERE AMAZED THAT THESE WERE TRUE STORIES THAT OCURRED IN HISTORY. THE PICTURE QUALITY AND SOUND WERE EXCELLENT.,1251849600,2,183,4.935483870967742
2877449,5,B000RZIGVI,"Honestly, anyone who enjoys The Untouchables and who liked the DVD releases from the first year of the show, that passes up this superb collection of the series' best episodes simply because they changed the commercial break bumpers is foolish.  Actually, the way they were handled in the first two sets was aggravating.  How many times do I need to look at that foolish book anyway!?

Now on to fun stuff from Season Two:

1) Paul Picerni joins the crew as Lee Hobson, making Ness's line, ""Rico, Lee"" as famous as ""Book 'em, Danno.""  However, Picerni was nowhere near as magnetic or interesting an actor as Anthony George, who was featured as Cam Allison during the first season.  Evidently, George caught somebody's eye as he became one of the stars of Checkmate! the next year.  If Picerni joined the cast as a reaction to Italian complaints, why give him such a whitebread name?

2) Steve London, as Rossman, must have examined the script each week and said, ""Damn! No lines again!""

3) Character actors ruled!!  The more European the better.  And it becomes clear by this set that The Untouchables used a reperatory group of actors.  Nehemiah Persoff had already starred as Jake Gusik, Johnny Fortunato and Waxey Gordon and Jack Warden was also featured three times, once as Ness's best friend.  Makes me wonder why someone doesn't say, ""Hmmm....you look awfully familiar!""  Joseph Wiseman, Luther Adler, Will Kuluva and Val Avery are all over the place, too.

4) Time is not linear in The Untouchables.  Frank Nitti is alive, then dies, then is featured again.  Lee Hobson was not around when Capone was convicted, then ""oops' there he is in a flashback when Capone was sent to jail in ""The Big Train Part One"" episode.  It's 1931, no...it's 1933, wait, it's 1932..hmmm'34?  This week Prohibition, next week no Prohibition..wait this episode Prohibition again.

5) It is a real kick to see Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) and Larry Tate (David White) make out in ""The Rusty Heller Story""

6) Look for 30 seconds of a 20 year old Ryan O' Neal at the end of ""The Legs Diamond Story""

7) The sets are pretty cheap.  The Dew Drop Inn shows up whether they're in Chicago, New York or St Louis. Same thing with the Turkish Bath.

8) Lots of smoking!  Wow, do these guys smoke.  Same thing with drinking! And method acting galore!

I love these DVD sets, mostly because when The Untouchables came on when I was a kid, I had to go to bed and I always felt like I was missing something really good.  Turns out, I was!  These shows are incredible fun.  Highly recommended!",1250640000,10,2568,4.680089485458613
2877450,5,B000RZIGVI,"As a kid, there was a single show that my parents were adamant that I not watch.  That was ""The Untouchables"".  Too violent for my delicate psyche to handle, I guess.  So, when I discovered the first season available on Amazon, I had to have it -- recession or no.  There have been no disappointments.  The B&W film has been masterfully reproduced to DVD.  The only thing missing is the commercials.  The bumper music between segments is intact as is the end credit music.  Seeing some of the guest stars before they made it big is always interesting and the cars, oh my word, the cars.  Wouldn't I love to have one of those old 30's pieces of iron!  Anyway, if you're looking to rekindle some forgotten memories, I would highly recommend this product.

Historically, this series is about as accurate as ""The Flintstones,"" but it's riveting crime melodrama nonetheless. (The original series is about 500 times better than the mediocre big-screen Brian De Palma 1980s film with the colorless Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness. The second 1990s TV series was also better than the movie, but this original series is the best.) It was, hands down, the most violent television series up to that time, and remains pretty strong even by modern standards.

2877460,3,B000RZIGVI,"I enjoyed the release of this set except for 1 thing; the editing of the bumpers off of the close of each act.  As another person pointed out it is a complete hack job; the music builds to a crescendo and then they fade it out and hack off the window at the end.  Another person thought they had messed with music tracks, but I have Beta (taped off air copies) and the music is the same.  In fact, I have worked in TV for a long time and this is the same music that was on the original series, then when it went into syndication in the late 60's and every repeat of it in various syndicated formats over the years.  I used see the films come into a tv station I worked at back in 1972 and the unedited film used to run around 52 minutes.  These episodes run around 50:20, so besides the windows being cut off of each act they edited another minute out somewhere.  They may have also used speed processing to compress it to save the time.  Does anyone know why they would cut the end act windows off?  It can't be for time.  It can't be for copyright.  So why would they do this?  I am extremely disappointed, but CBS/Paramount doesn't care, as they think they are doing us a favor by releasing them at all.",1214784000,2,1206,4.133047210300429

2877463,4,B000RZIGVI,"Yes, the Untouchables Season II continues the same hard-hitting,
brilliantly filmed drama which equals the quality of the First Season;  in fact, the ""Purple Gang"" episode, with it's dark, brooding atmosphere and the unhinged brutality of Steve Cochran's character, is about as intense as you'd be likely to see in the still-early days of TV.

I, too am disappointed in the editorial tampering with these episodes, including the lack of ""bumpers"" at the end of each act.  WORSE though,for me, is the general visual quality of the shows, which is a DEFINITE step DOWN from the that of the first season---lots of graininess, etc. Apparently this set was taken from a set of tapes edited for TV syndication.

So what's up, CBS-Paramount?  Why charge the same HIGH price per episode while delivering shoddier quality?

Another oddity of Season 2; for some reason (probably as a cost-saving
measure), there is a heavy use of what sounds like MUSIC-LIBRARY tracking
in the background scores of these episodes.  There's lots of music that sounds like that goofy ""symphonic-moderne"" stuff from the 1950's, as if the music editor on the show was raiding the same library that Ed Wood did for ""Plan 9"".  It's really disconcerting, having become used to the gritty, jazzed-up ""noir"" sound of the first season.

The haunting voice of the background-narrator is a brilliant gimmick that you keep hearing whenever you reminiscence the series.

The entire production outcompetes many if not most of today's series in quality of all cinematographic aspects.

It turns out, in my opinion, to be some of the best television made anywhere or at any time. Many of the important points have already been covered, but I would add one little thing: the cars look like authentic, working vehicles rather than expensively-restored museum pieces, a benefit of filming only 30 years after the event.

2877477,1,B000RZIGVI,"Once they hooked the customer and reviewers by the quality of the 1st season set of The Untouchables, they then release pure butchered trash on the Season 2 Vol 1 set. Is this a practice we can expect more and more from CBS-Paramount DVD's?

The trademark of the show was the way each act would end with the background music crescendoing and segue into the signature tune of the closing bumper. Unlike the Season 1 DVD set you will not find that here. They hacked off the first three act's closing bumpers. By lopping off the bumpers they had to fade out the scenes and background music before they actually ended, making for a sloppy edit that makes the end of each act seem very awkward and loosing the original emotional effect that was originally conceived. This was a complete hack job.

Who knows, these could be the butchered up versions made for the VHS market about twenty years ago, not the direct transfers to DVD from original 35mm film that were on the 1st season set.

And don't let anyone tell you there were no bumpers in Season 2. All four seasons of the Untouchables had them (opening and closing for each act).

The 1st season DVD set was as excellent as anyone could wish for. I cannot comprehend how they could release Season 2 Vol 1 in such a debased way. Too bad I can't return it to Amazon because of defective content. It is apparent that CBS-Paramount do not respect their customers.

There will be no Untouchables Season 2 Vol 2 on my wish list and I would suggest to all true fans of The Untouchables to avoid Season 2 Vol 1.",1206057600,62,1553,4.435087719298245
2877478,5,B000RZIGVI,"The 118 hour-long episodes (appropriately in B&W) of the crime drama ""The Untouchables"" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1959-1963. The first 16 episodes of Season Two are listed below with their original air dates.

The series was promoted as a docudrama-type presentation based on the real-life cases of government agent Eliot Ness (Robert Stack) during the 1930's. Despite this claim the promoters took considerable liberties with the actual history of Ness's squad of ""Untouchables"" (incorruptible) as well considerable dramatic license as every G-man vs the mob clich and caricature was incorporated into stories.

The style is less like a docudrama than the screaming headlines of a scandal focused Hearst newspaper from the era; complete with a Walter Winchell's newsreel-like narration. But this added zip to the series and made it a big hit. The many stereotypes simply made the story telling more efficient and did not interfere with the viewer getting into the story.

The episodes are of two basic types; macro (big-name crime bosses) and micro (innocents and low-level hoods caught up in forces over which they have little control). Although the macro type episodes are the ones most subject to historical liberties, both types work reasonably well and the ability of the series to shift between them gave the writers a lot more potential material to work with and in part accounted for the series not running out of gas after just a season or two.

Stack and the actors playing his main agents generally remain intact from the first season. These include Nick Georgiade as Rossi, Paul Picerni as Hobson, Steve London as Rossman, Abel Fernandez as Youngfellow, and Jerry Paris as Flaherty. Frank Nitti (Bruce Gordon) was the most prominent of the villains.

Apparently the series was an annoyance to then FBI. head J. Edgar Hoover, who frequently had to explain that Ness and his men were agents of the Treasury Department, not the FBI.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

Yes, a lot of the stories portray real life characters who never had dealings with Ness.  However, the enjoyment for me is seeing the bad guy get what he deserves.

2877482,5,B000RZIGVI,"Retro television shows have never done particularly well unless they were set in the Old West. Shows set in the 20's, 30's, 40's, etc, any era outside of the one in which they aired have never lasted long except in three major exceptions - Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, and The Untouchables.

The Untouchables succeeded for a number of reasons. First, the veil that had been on the Mafia for a number of years was slowly but surely being peeled off due to gangland killings and the fame of gangsters such as Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, Dutch Schultz, Lucky Luciano, and others. Even before the Godfather and its outstanding first sequel, the public had a fascination and curiosity with the mob. So take some true events, ture characters, heavily fictionalize them with Hollywood gloss and pathos, and you get a very successful show that made a star out of Robert Stack and brought new fame to a Treasury agent named Eliot Ness.

The Untouchables' First Season collection should not have been split up into multiple sections. That's greed, pure and simple. But the lure of this show - its great characters, performances, grit and intelligence will draw buyers even though they know they're being ripped off. Stack's Ness is one of the best alltime detectives - fearless, relentless, and absolutely ruthless with the bad guys. The supporting casts were always excellent, and Bruce Gordon brough the right amount of humor and menace to Frank Nitti, Capone's chief lieutenant.

The replacement set(which Amazon was good enough to ship to me )also had a disc with the same problem. I was able to mix and match and form 1 perfect set . I have encountered this problem in a number of sets purchased since August/September 2007 both region 1(US) and region 4 (Australia).The bubbling appears to be mainly in the center of the disc and my concern is whether over time the laminated surface of the disc will eventually peel rendering the disc useless.

Yes, those people were real, but I don't think Eliot Ness ever dealt with them.  Most of them, I think, were dealt with by the FBI.  The book that Mr. Ness helped author ends with the disposal of Al Capone.  So, to say that the first two episodes were based on that book is absolutely true.  To continue to say that the remaining episodes in the series are based on the book is pure fiction and a figment of hollywood's imagination.  Does this make it bad entertainment?  Absolutely not!!

8203384,2,B000RZIGVI,"So disappointed! I anxiously tried to open my ""The Untouchables"" Season 2 Vol. 1 case I bought myself as a treat and about cut my finger off using a razor blade. The case has that identifying strip across the top that is attached to the entire wrap, like CDs that denotes the contents, like a playbill. If you tear it off, you'll be looking at a plain box!

I buy quite a few DVD compilations and the area I think needs to improving is the respect of these production companies for the product inside their flimsy cases. I have never seen more of a lack of interest in not wanting to protect the product inside as I have lately. Don't these companies realize that discs SCRATCH??

After finally opening the case, all the discs are loose, sliding around inside because the cheap ass spindle inside is smaller than the hole in the disc, preventing it from staying in place.

Now that I've told you about the inferior packaging, let me tell you about the actual quality of the show itself. I'd give it a 2 also. The audio is ridiculous. I have a brand new Sony 48"" UHD TV and it has a great sound system. So good, I don't use a high quality soundbar I had with my older TV. The player is a new BluRay player. The audio on these discs is cranked to 64 on my volume level. Regular broadcasts are around 40 and many other DVD discs like Perry Mason usually track about 43-45.

The picture quality is grainy, but I understand that. It's circa 1960 and in black and white. That doesn't bother me as much as the volume being so low. It's just a shame one can't purchase these classic shows and know they're going to be quality checked and play at the high caliber they were intended.

Wake up CBS Video. Get your act together. I was tempted to buy the complete series of ""The Untouchables"" but after watching this, I wouldn't waste my time or money! Neither should you.",1482883200,,1860,4.348703170028818
