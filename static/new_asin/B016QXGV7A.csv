I would definitely recommend this to anyone, if you're already a fan of the band its a no brainer, get it!",1450656000,,250,4.5777777777777775
7479633,5,B016QXGV7A,"When Amazon first put this up for preorder, the blu ray was labeled as Region B which meant I wouldn't be able to enjoy one of my favorite bands in HD, I would have to go to DVD. Fortunately, another reviewer on here said that was wrong so I took the plunge. I am currently on the third song watching this and I am so happy. It IS Region FREE and wow, the picture and sound are amazing.  It captures the sound of the live performance and all the fun instruments they use (like the hollow tube the girl twirls around).  The picture is great and crystal clear. Almost too clear, lol.  This is a great concert for any Placebo fan as all their releases have been amazing from Soulmates in Paris, We Come in Pieces and now this. No shortage of amazing in Placebo's catalog.",1450569600,5,768,4.2465753424657535
