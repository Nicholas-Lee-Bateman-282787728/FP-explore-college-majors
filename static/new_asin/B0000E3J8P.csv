1936391,5,B0000E3J8P,"The DVD is divided into several sections.  The first section offers a little bit of a background and touches upon discoveries related to brainwave synchronization.  One point made, which I have appreciated the most, is Jonathan's remark that it's not only the particular brainwave pattern that matters, but rather the intent (state of mind and heart) accompanying it that is even more important. This explains why different people using the same method may get different results, or why different people using completely different methods may experience success working on the same issue.

The next sextion offers a brief overview of cymatics - images and forms created in different materials using sounds.

The following section guides you through a ""sound meditation"" working with ""aum"" sounds and the vowels a, e, i, o, u.

Then there is a brief sections on ""sound healing"" using tibetan bowl.  If you've ever wondered how you can use it for healing, you can learn few simple techniques on this DVD.

The DVD ends with sounds clips from several recordings by Jonathan.

This DVD provides a great, but brief introduction to Healing Sounds, and I did wish that the sections on ""sound meditation"" and ""sound healing"" were longer.",1146009600,54,1229,5.079601990049751
1936392,5,B0000E3J8P,"If you are one of those people who likes to sing all the time and singing makes you happy but you don't know why, Johnathan Goldman has the answer. In this DVD, he tells us how singing and the human voice can help us relieve stress, heal our bodies and release our emotional difficulties. Grounded in scientific and spiritual reseach and practice, this is an excellent, informative and beneficial DVD.",1140393600,25,401,4.742857142857143
1936393,3,B0000E3J8P,The DVD has a home movie sort of feel although it is obvious it is professional. The information is helpful but I am not inclined to load it and watch it again and again... moves slow.,1127692800,17,184,4.138888888888889
1936394,5,B0000E3J8P,I knew nothing about this subject til I happened upon it. It's fascinating! I want to learn more after seeing this video. What was interesting was all the science behind it explained in simple terms for us non-science types. I will look for more on this subject.,1080259200,6,262,4.595744680851064

8001885,5,B0000E3J8P,"In its essence so full of ""ah - of course"" moments. Interested in true knowledge? Healing sounds makes a lot of sense.",1424131200,,118,4.409090909090909
8001886,5,B0000E3J8P,"It was through the 'Healing Sounds' DVD that I heard about Jonathan Goldman. Only afterwards I ordered his books 'Healing Sounds' and 'Tantra of Sound,' which I equally reviewed. From the start of watching this DVD I was captivated.

Goldman understands to present a highly complex and  rather mathematical matter in an easy style, without losing depth. And he artfully has interwoven practice and theory, as this DVD is not just a lecture but spends about half of the time in pure practical advice. This production is good for everyone who wants to learn the basics and even advanced techniques of sound healing. It is also an excellent awareness-builder. Here is how the DVD is built and what it contains over the one hour and a half of its really generous playing time. Part I gives a general introductory lecture about the principles and the healing properties of sound. Here Goldman speaks to a small audience in an elegant, intimate setting.

Part II is an interesting interlude about Cymatics and the experiences of Dr. Hans Jenny in the 1970s that Goldman further references in his book Healing Sounds. Goldman shows how with Cymatics it was proved that sound creates patterns, very specific and beautiful patterns, and that the form and size of the patterns depends on the frequency of the sound.

Part III is an experiment with creating a sound that matches the group oversoul of the audience. Jonathan Goldman creates an overtone sound, using overtone singing, a technique used, inter alia, by Tibetan monks, in order to project light into the luminous bodies of all people present in the audience, and the house where he gave his presentation.

Part IV is a practical demonstration of Jonathan Goldman applying a healing treatment to a person by using vocal intonations and sound created by a Tibetan bowl.

Part V is an overview of recordings by Jonathan Goldman that he has realized using his expertise in overtone singing and projecting intent into sound for various purposes.

I highly recommend this DVD for everyone, professionals or lay people, interested in sound healing, not only as a practitioner, but also for personal awareness building on the importance and omnipresence of sound in our life.",1401321600,,2218,4.978378378378379
8001887,5,B0000E3J8P,"It was informative and helpful. It explains what some people think of as mystical, in a scientific way, showing that ancient mysticism is actually science- the science of sound/frequencies. It was worth way more than I paid for it. It will change your life to watch this video.",1249689600,,277,4.791666666666667
8001888,1,B0000E3J8P,"This item was reviewed with Ocean Suite as having ocean sounds.  It has no ocean sounds, just some musical sounds that someone may think mimic the ocean.  I don't, and I am unhappy with it.  I am shipping it back for a refund.",1236384000,,226,4.209302325581396
8001889,5,B0000E3J8P,"Jonathan Goldman is a master with sound.  In this work he takes us on an experiential journey using our own ability to generate sound and connect to the world around us.  I learned much about meditation and the nature of "" Om "".  This work will heal many things in your life.  At the very least the complicated will simplify and you will breathe easily again.",1229731200,,359,4.393939393939394
8001890,4,B0000E3J8P,"I gave this video 4 stars based on the content alone.  However this is another one of those holistic videos that is nothing more than a taped seminar.  Again the information contained in this video is well worth the price of the DVD however this is not a ""WOW"" in the presentation department.  Good for the collection, but don't expect to be blown away.",1204243200,7,353,4.484375
8001891,1,B0000E3J8P,"A hippy looking guy sitting on a chair infront of some people in a cabin talking isn't my idea of fun or money well spent. He can make sounds I'll grant him that, but healing ones?! The whole dvd was far less than I expected and I didn't find it at all useful. If you are novice in the field of meditation like me buy some classical music instead or cd's with sounds of nature.",1180656000,6,377,4.04
8001892,2,B0000E3J8P,Jonathan Goldman is a great author and very informative. In this DVD there was too much talking and very boring. My sister and I fell asleep within the first 20 minutes. I have other products by Jonathan and have loved them. This one I would not recommend unless you have trouble sleeping at night.,1179100800,8,298,4.537037037037037
