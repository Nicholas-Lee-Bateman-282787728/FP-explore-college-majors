1781365,1,B00006JMTF,"This has to be the worst dramatization of a pop/rock singer's life. Opening with one or two insignificant scenes (including an 11 year-old Richard in a dress), it quickly jumps to the ""Little Richard"" incarnation, complete with flamboyant hair and a penchant for high shrills and signature screams. What the film fails to convey is Richard's infamous meeting with Esquerita (whom he met at the Macon bus stop at one in the morning, doing god-only-knows what). They went back to Richard's pad and stayed up together until the sunrise, with the South Carolinian, Esquerita, showing off his dandified musical act, playing ""Mint Julep"" over and over, and demonstrating his entirely original screams and shrills. In his autobiography, Little Richard fully gives Esquerita props for this essential element of the Lil Richard act. In this weak dramatization of his life, there is no development of Richard's style or sound. The details are insignificant and the content devoid of important facts or significance.",1076976000,5,1005,5.248447204968944
1781366,4,B00006JMTF,"I grew up with the music of Little Richard, Fats Domino, Elvis and really never understood the real stories behind these influential rock artists.  This made for television movie accurately recreates the life and times of the man who really did put the ""rock""in rock and roll. Although I have only watched a portion of the dvd, I can recommend it to anyone who has any interest in this always fascinating artist who still contributes today:  check out his performance on ""Kindred Spirits"", the Johnny Cash tribute album.",1036368000,,520,4.8977272727272725
1781367,5,B00006JMTF,"I love, love, love this movie.  It is dynamic and funny and sad all at the same time.  But who came up with the price?  Do you realize how much money you are missing out on because I would never pay $75.00 to $140.00 for a movie that comes on TV.  What is up with that?  I was going to purchase it as a stocking stuffer for my mother and buy one for myself but forget about it.  I would record it on VHS before I pay that much and I hate VHS tapes. Too Bad!!!",1417478400,2,459,3.7291666666666665

1781370,5,B00006JMTF,"This movie is fantastic. I have watched it many times. I have been trying to buy it for a long time. I finally gave up on the DVD and still had to pay about $20.00 for a used VHS! Why is it so expensive? I agree that it is very entertaining and addictive. Leon excelled in his performance as Little Richard!  He is great in every part he plays in each movie. The Temptations and The Five  Heartbeats are two other examples of his brilliance.  He gets very involved in each role and is quite convincing. Not to mention, a fantastic musician himself, with his band, Leon and the Peoples!  He really can sing.",1404691200,4,606,4.2894736842105265
1781371,1,B00006JMTF,I would like to buy a DVD but it's way to expensive for a TV movie. I just don't understand why it would cost this much. I really don't want to give it 1 star but the price is too ugh.,1400198400,4,184,3.5121951219512195
1781372,5,B00006JMTF,"This is a great movie about the life of Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Little Richard Pennyman but the price to own it is far beyond normal and one of the reasons why more copies of this great movie have yet to be sold. If they are selling a bunch of them for $67, then more power to them but great movies like ""Forest Gump"", ""The Godfather"", ""The Goodfellas"", ""The Five Heartbeats"", ""The Temptation Story"", ""Twelve Years A Slave"", ""What's Love Got To Do With It"" and ""The Best Man Holiday"" are priced at the normal rate of between $10 and $25 even on Blu-Ray and that is considered reasonable... Just a suggestion to increase your sales of this great movie... Thanks...",1397001600,,667,4.430894308943089
1781373,4,B00006JMTF,"This isn't a perfect movie--I've never found a musical biopic that lived up to my hopes as a fan (that would probably be too much ""documentary-style"" to be entertaining). But it avoids a few of pitfalls of other film biographies (Johnny Cash's comes to mind) and has so many positives, not the least of which is Leon's excellent performance as ""Little Richard"". It gives a taste of his life and a hint of some of the hardships he went through (many struggling artists will relate to his problems with his overbearing, abusive father). Richard was so bold--about sexuality and self expression and art--that it's a nice movie for tolerance, even though it unfortunately does downplay a lot of what made him unique. Still, it's great to hear some of the origins of rock and roll back when people were still ""shocked"" by it. Also interesting is his religious devotion while creating music that was being criticized as ""Satan's"".

It's always a thrill to see and hear Little Richard play piano. There's also some other great music (including the Ink Spots ""If I Didn't Care"") worked in and for people who didn't grow up in this era or haven't seen these real performers today, it's an opportunity to get a feeling for Little Richard's contributions to American music.  But it's not a history lesson--it's an entertaining movie with enough of his terrific, exuberant music that, hopefully, when they're finished watching, people will look it up on YouTube and see him performing live, get some of the albums, etc.

To hear him performing his ""Greatest Hits"", this is the album I'd recommend--there are free samples of all the songs in the Amazon listing and if you buy the CD you get a free MP3 download of the entire album as well,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Very-Best-Of-Little-Richard/dp/B0018D4SHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Very Best Of Little Richard</a>

1781374,2,B00006JMTF,"As a LR fan this movie was too short and missed quite a few details.  For instance there was no mention of his father kicking him out of the house and he went to live with a white couple for 2 years of his young life because his father suspected his homosexual tendencies.  Also this Little Richard was kind of tall of which he really was ""little"".  A much better job was done with the Jerry lee Lewis story, ""Great Balls Of Fire"".  That movie got the full treatment where this one seemed low budget.",1392854400,,500,4.231578947368421
1781375,5,B00006JMTF,I loved this movie when it first came out. The price is nuts. I guess they don't want to sell it. I would never pay that outrageous price.,1382227200,3,138,3.9642857142857144

1781380,4,B00006JMTF,"Personally I'm a big fan of Little Richard and I really enjoyed this TV movie about his life. I've heard all of his recordings, I've read the book and I've even met the Man. But in all the reviews I've read, one thing has been missing. I own the Artisan DVD release listed on Amazon. The DVD itself, the liner notes in the case, and the Amazon listing have the time listed at 120 minutes. My Artisan DVD release only plays at ~ 88 minutes.

1781383,4,B00006JMTF,"I almost forgot about this Robert Townsend-directed movie until I saw it on television the other night. What I do remember is that it was a made for TV movie that aired in 2000, and I did see it then. Not knowing much about Little Richard's background other than his flamboyant stage act and his classic records, I thought that this was a great introduction to the life of a man whom, in my opinion, never really got the credit he deserved being a pioneer of rock 'n roll. Those honors always seem to go to other acts of the day (Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, Pat Boone - please give us a break!), when the REAL pioneers of the genre are mostly ignored or have been reduced to being mere footnotes in rock 'n roll history. Those who are die-hard fans of Richard and his music might find this film to be lacking in many ways, but for those who are just getting familiar with this man's life and his music, this is a good place to begin their research.

Leon is an exceptional actor who seems to portray a lot of musical figures on film, and very well, I might add. Who can forget his dynamic (and probably most well known) performance as the former Temptation David Ruffin in the still popular ""The Temptations"" mini-series, or as J.T. Matthews in the early 1990's feature film ""The Five Heartbeats""? (I've even seen him play Jackie Wilson in another movie mini-series, however, he had a small role in that film.) As Little Richard Penniman, Leon engrosses himself in his subject and although the film is not entirely factual, it piques your interest enough to make you want to seek out the real story of his life. I know, after seeing it yet again, I want to learn more!

My only complaint is that two hours (TV running time, anyway) was hardly enough time to capture the story of this man - this certainly deserved the mini-series treatment. It was like viewing Richard's career and personal life on fast forward - you didn't get the chance to learn whom his main influences were, or understand why he made some of the decisions he did because the film seemed rushed, especially during the last half hour. However, it is an enjoyable movie and definitely worth watching. It needs to be made available again - any fan of rock 'n roll musical bios will want to add this to their collection.",1211500800,4,2304,4.483333333333333

1781385,5,B00006JMTF,"The Little Richard Story is a credible account of the man who, more than any other individual artist, erased the word ""race-music"" and created popular music.  Although only a small part of his life and 55 year (and still counting) career was highlighted, the DVD really captures the essence of the man - the battle between his faith in the Lord and the temptations of the world, and the development of the most important musical art form of the twentieth century - rock music.  Leon is amazing in the title role, bringing to the screen the attractive, sensual black musician with the raspy, force-of-nature voice, that racist parents in America fought so hard (and so unsuccessfully) to keep from their children's senses.  If you love rock, r&b or rap, and are interested in the roots of the music (the black church), this DVD is a must to add to your collection.",1098576000,13,863,4.701986754966887
1781386,5,B00006JMTF,"I saw this on cable, and it really was well produced, and although the film doesn't mention that Little Richard's main influence was Esquirita.
