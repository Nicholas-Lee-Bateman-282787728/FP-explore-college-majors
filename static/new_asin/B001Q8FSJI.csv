8335146,4,B001Q8FSJI,"I only vaguely remember seeing this back in the early 70's. It was shown at of all places, a drive in theater that was showing ""Art"" films. There was shortage od controversy with that either,as there homes behind it. Resulted in moving the screen so that it wasn't visible from the road and a super tall fence around it. Anyway, some of us guys would slip out there and catch a movie from time to time. When this movie was advertised , I couldn't find anyone to go, and my girlfriend at the time went. I wasn't particularly comfortable with watching tha thing with her there, but she turned out to be pretty tolerant ( Payback was not too long in coming, when I had to taske to some mushy chick flick with absolutely no action). I called a couple of the guys and told them I had it and they came over and we watched it ( Just the Nick Phillips Film ). It was typical Nick Phillips of the time. He did make sure he had a story, and by today's standards the sex was muted and not explicit ( would probably be like those shown on Cinemax late night as far as the explicitness goes). It was good to revisit a Nick Phillips film. Probably a bit more ""Arty"" than some would like in the flash back style of storytelling. Also, taking a good dose of Drano, does not make for a very pleasant story either. As usual, Phillips, was able to convey the sex, without being visually explicit ( not the case in his later films such as Gunilla ). This film would probably only please those of that era, others would probably consider it too tame by today's standards. I haven't seen the other two films as yet, so will have to do an update.",1273190400,4,1623,4.2387096774193544
8335147,5,B001Q8FSJI,"The '72 version of ""Fire in Her Bed"" and the ""Where the Air is Cool and Dark"" films are both yawners.  I can't recommend either one.

But the 2008 version of ""Fire in Her Bed"" with Angelina Dekker and Maria Palentini is incredibly hot!  The erotic imagery is wonderful!

It involves a domination/submission lesbian relationship between two very pretty young women, with the blonde girl completely taking control of her beautiful brunette ""slave.""  Whoever directed and/or wrote this thing has talent and imagination!

My favorite moment, or one of them at least, was when the two women first meet.  It's clear right from the start that the blonde girl is attracted to the pretty brunette.  She corners her in the ladies room, and it becomes instantly obvious that these two are perfectly matched, with the short-haired brunette instantly ready to submit to the dominant blonde's desires!  The blonde bends the other girl over the sink, slaps her lovely ass a few times, then does her from behind with a strap-on!  Great stuff!

This is far hotter than most XXX-rated videos I've seen!  More, please!",1251244800,22,1099,4.913043478260869
