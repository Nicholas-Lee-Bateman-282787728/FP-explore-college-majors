8401584,4,B003ODIUXO,"Just like the star rating says, we liked the subject matter of toy brand development. It's something we have acquainted ourselves with firsthand. The toy industry can be a tough road. - www. QubitsToy.com",1439683200,,204,5.029411764705882
8401585,4,B003ODIUXO,"The video is well done. It shows a glimpse behind the curtain of the toy industry. I would like to have seen more but maybe that is just me. It is family friendly but kids today may not know of many of the classic toys revealed in the video.

I enjoyed it. I simply wanted to see more of the behind the scenes at the corporate level. Most of the eye-view was that of the inventor and designer. I know what that looks like. I wanted to see how the companies act behind those shiny closed doors in the ivory towers. I guess that is for a different documentary.

Am I glad I bought it? Yes.
Am I glad I watched it? Yes.
Would I watch it a second time? No need to.
