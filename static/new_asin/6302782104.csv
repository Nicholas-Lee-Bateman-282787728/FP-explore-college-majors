7830784,5,6302782104,"Even being in VHS form, these 2 videos are good quality and are very entertaining for train buffs. Both videos are shot during the Australian Bicentennial in 1988 with a variety of steamers including the Flying Scotsman. Even if one was unfamiliar with Australian steam locomotives, these videos give a warm introduction to the locomotives of the land down under.",1388016000,,363,5.066666666666666
7830785,1,6302782104,"This set of 2 VHS tapes is erroneously included in the category with the 1929 British motion picture drama titled ""Flying Scotsman.""

The two videos in this set were made in Australia in 1988.  The video titled ""Flying Scotsman"" is NOT the 1929 British film drama.  It depicts the visit of the locomotive of that name to Australia during 1988.  ""Steam Alive"" has videos of different steam locomotives operating on tourist railroads in Australia.

Both videos are interesting to railroad buffs and people who like steam locomotives.  I think they are worth the few dollars charged for the set, but I wish they were more accurately described in Amazon's listing.  Amazon lists this set as though it included the 1929 ""Flying Scotsman"" movie with the names of actors, etc.  It is NOT that film!",1237852800,,791,4.850746268656716
