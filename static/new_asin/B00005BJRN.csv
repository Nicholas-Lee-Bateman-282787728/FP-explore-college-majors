7937654,5,B00005BJRN,"This is a wonderful 2 tape set for the Southern Gospel music fan. All the great legends are here telling their funny road and concert stories about happenings to them and others. There is Wendy Bagwell, Les Beasley, Glen Payne, George Younce, Brock Speer, Ben Speer, Rex Nelon, James Blackwood, Joel Hemphill, J.D.Sumner, Jake Hess, Herman Harper, Eldridge Fox, and Jerry Goff. A lot of these greats have passed on now, and that makes this well worth having if you are a great Gaither Homecoming fan and Southern Gospel music fan. You'll love this. No music, only the comedy.",1063756800,2,575,4.818181818181818
