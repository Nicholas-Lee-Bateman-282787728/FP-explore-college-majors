8129010,3,B000G6BLJW,"I bought this mainly for the dvd Hope Floats - my favorite movie.  Speed was pretty good - intense.  Who doesn't love Keanu Reeves!  Love Potion No. 9 was not so good.  Certainly not Bullock's best performance.  But to get two good movies out of three isn't so bad when you pay the price for one!  If you are a Bullock fan, this is not a bad deal.",1369612800,3,347,4.029411764705882

8129012,5,B000G6BLJW,"Sandra Bullock in three movies all in one set??  How great is that?!?!

These three movies are great together, they showcase Sandra in three fantastic different roles.

Speed : In this film we find Sandra as a passenger on a bus who ends up driving the bus and if she goes under 70 MPH it will blow up!  This film has suspense, action and yes even love.  This is the first film she and Keanu Reeves made together.

Hope Floats : Another fantastic Sandra performace, where she is a mother, who's husband takes her on a Ricky Lake kind of show and tells her he is cheating on her with her best friend.  This film then follows the aftermath of having a cheating husband; and the toll it takes on her and her daughter.  Sandra does a fabulous job playing a woman who is in great pain, but keeps it hidden extremely well.

Love Potion No. 9 : Finally we have the romantic comedy!  Sandra plays a dorky scientist who's friend has this magic potion that after you spray it in your mouth and then speak, the first person who hears you talk first falls in love with you!  She plays the best geek I have ever seen, and then she even turns into our beautiful Sandra by the end!  Her costar in this film is Tate Donavon, and the chemistry between these two is amazing!

So there you have it, three wonderful films with the worlds GREATEST actress as the star!",1160870400,16,1347,4.2976190476190474
