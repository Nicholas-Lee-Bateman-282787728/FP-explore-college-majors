8511043,1,B0076OFF7G,"This movie promises to show you the counter-Biblical hidden messages in your kids' favorite Disney films.  This is an intriguing idea, and I hope someone makes that movie one day.  But this is not that movie.

Now I've got pages and pages of problems with this movie that I really want to write here, but I'll spare you and just tell you what's really bothering me... the authors cherry-picked examples from a couple of movies (Mulan 2, Cinderella 2, Aladdin, Wall-E) to try to prove points that they believe nullified all the positive aspects of those stories -- a ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"" situation.  The authors are going to find inherent imperfections in any secular fiction stories -- whether cartoons or classic literature or songs, whether Disney or Tolkien.  Rather than comparing and contrasting the virtues extolled in each work, they hone in on some unimportant detail and point out how it's counter-Biblical.  A story set in ancient China will have dragons, a story set in ancient Persia will have genies.

Their main points?  First, that main characters should not take advice from non-human friends who could possibly bear any resemblance to the devil.
The second, that main characters should stop ""following their heart"" and instead strictly obey the laws of their native lands (though I imagine they probably don't agree with all the laws in place in ancient China or ancient Persia).  And in the case of Wall-E, they somehow got the idea that Wall-E was supposed to be the devil and the ship was supposed to represent Heaven, when the plot of the movie was actually closer to the opposite.

To make matters worse, this movie was so full of disconnected snide remarks (how many times do you need to remind me that Aladdin is a thief?), and its arguments so unsupported (either using the work or Biblically), that it was just a chore to watch.

If you believe, as I do, that many secular fiction works still have some redeeming values (like teaching grace, humility, bravery, generosity, etc), then you won't learn anything new from this movie.
Likewise, if you believe that any secular fiction work is made by man and must therefore be completely disregarded, well then, you already know everything in this movie anyways and probably don't really need to watch it.

Enjoy!",1412467200,2,2303,4.861892583120205
8511044,5,B0076OFF7G,"This was a very very good documentary, I used to watch a lot of these disney films when I was little. This really opened my eyes to see the truth into these disney films, and even the cartoons that I used to watch. I really recommend this documentary to kids that love watching disney films, and cartoons. Keep up the good work Little light studios am sure God is proud as to what you guys are doing to reveal the truth about the things of what we used to watch on television when we were kids.
Thank you Little light studios, and God bless you.",1381968000,4,545,4.2
8511045,5,B0076OFF7G,"Vital for all parents and teens to watch.  Shows how the devil is using subtle, entertaining, and humorous methods to implant things in our mind that are contrary to the Bible.  Things such as - ""Rules (the Law) are bad,"" and ""follow your heart.""  Shows how cartoons are even promoting secret societies and pornography in preschool programming.  Much of the great controversy is being fought in the realm of media and Little Light Studios does a wonderful job of exposing the deception in a compelling way.  Through television, the devil is trying to undo everything God is wanting to do in our lives.  By beholding we become changed.",1347926400,4,634,4.824074074074074
