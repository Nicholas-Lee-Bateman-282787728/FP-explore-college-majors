6600859,4,B00MU1YG6G,"- Raffles toys with the police: ""I can tell you what he is. He's a myth, a phantom, an up-to-date jack-o'-lantern invented by the police... Everytime Scotland Yard fails to catch the perpetrator of some decently intelligent theft, they blame the Cracksman.""

Ronald Colman, that supremely poised Englishman, was neither the first nor the last to play A.J. Raffles on the screen, but he may be the best to have done it, just as he's the best Bulldog Drummond. Sorry, John Barrymore. Sorry, David Niven and Anthony Valentine. No one else quite had Colman's sublime delivery and that air of unflappability. RAFFLES, released in 1930, was only one film removed from 1929'S BULLDOG DRUMMOND, the landmark film that extended Colman's acting career and transitioned him from silent to talkies. RAFFLES cemented him even more firmly as that suave gent with the honeyed voice and the impeccable way with diction. Matinee idol, yes indeed.

Forgive this film its trespasses. In 1930, the audio technology was far from perfected (for its time, it's actually not too shabby; it was even nominated for Best Sound). The plot is kinda creaky, enlivened only by Colman's presence. The plot goes something like this: For the sake of his dear, lovely socialite girlfriend Gwen (played by sophisticated Kay Francis), the notorious Amateur Cracksman has just called it a day. A.J. Raffles has burgled his last safe, has absconded with his last bit of ice. Except that, thankfully for us, it's a short retirement. To extricate his hapless pal ""Bunny"" Manders from an embarassing debt, Raffles dives back into his thieving ways. Mere hours after his self-rehabilitation, he's pulling off another jewel heist. My, that precious necklace sure is sparkly.

A.J. Raffles hobnobs with England's upper crust during the day, steals them blind during the night, and we love him for it. The press makes him out almost as a folk hero. You can blame E.W. Hornung - who was brother-in-law to Sherlock Holmes' creator, Arthur Conan Doyle - for romanticizing such a shady profession. But this gentleman burglar is stricken with a case of good samaritan, and this trait is what redeems him. And, although Colman's version of Raffles doesn't do much to champion the needy and impoverished (I'm pretty sure ""Bunny"" doesn't count), he IS a wicked hand at cricket and so damn charming and amiable. Friend, I'll have you know that cooly cracking a safe whilst in a top hat is the very definition of swagger.

On the same evening that the Amateur Cracksman targets a stately country manor, a dodgy crew of thieves also moves in for the snatch. Raffles finds himself not only foiling his low-rent rivals but also having to elude a suspicious Scotland Yard Inspector. But all these taut cat and mouse games pale next to the sudden dilemma of his lady friend Gwen's beginning to sniff something fishy about her man. Good thing Raffles is a smooth operator in more than just the field of nicking stuff. He's got a way about him. At the end, even the dogged Scotland Yard Inspector ruefully concedes: ""Well, one can't help liking him.""

- Raffles toys some more with the police: ""You know, I can only think of one thing more exciting than tracking down criminals the way you do -- dodging you fellows.""

David Niven was 29 years old when he had his crack at playing the gentleman burglar. It's also the first time he received top billing. Afterwards Niven would embark on a six year ""sabbatical"" as WWII had broken out during the shooting of the film, and Niven would promptly enlist in the British Army. As enjoyable and polished an actor as Niven is, it's his off-camera exploits that are by far more admirable and inspirational. He's an honest-to-gosh real life hero.

RAFFLES (1939) is virtually a line-by-line re-do of Colman's version that, in terms of Niven's film legacy, may not have been the best idea. It begs a direct comparison between the two actors, and it's Niven who suffers for it. Colman is that untouchable. Still, this is a fun caper film, and Niven gets to show off his own roguish style and dashing wit. His love interest is played by Olivia de Havilland who didn't exactly embrace her participation in the film. Fresh off a plum part in GONE WITH THE WIND, de Havilland saw her role of ""Gwen"" as a regression to when she was dismissed simply as the decorative eye candy. Still, she's such a striking beauty, I find it entirely plausible that her burgling beau would give up his life of crime. It's an utterly piggish thing to say, but I wouldn't mind rifling thru that window dressing.",1410652800,7,4561,4.809948979591836

8674502,4,B00MU1YG6G,"It's nice to have this ""Raffles"" double film set.  I like the books and both films stick to the initial Raffles story pretty well, except for offering Hollywood endings.  The 1939 David Niven film is a fairly-close remake of the 1929 Ronald Colman ""Raffles"", but the 1939 is much better paced and, apart from its crime-does-not-pay required ending, is a superior film.  I say this, despite the fact that I prefer Ronald Colman to David Niven.  If you like 1930s and '40s crime film series like ""The Thin Man"", ""Boston Blackie"", ""The Lone Wolf"", and company, you'll probably enjoy these two Raffles movies.",1441843200,10,605,4.844660194174757
8674503,5,B00MU1YG6G,"Its interesting to see the same play be enacted by old favourites (actors) showing different times in morals and sensitivites of the viewing public.  Ronald Coleman playing raffles is similar in robin hood tendencies like David Niven's,  but Bunny, in Ronald's version attempts to gas himself, different from the chosen method in David's...Far from the original they play up the niceness of the character, rather than the totally for me attitude of the original character by creator Hornung... and The screen play writer pushes the gambling of Bunny as the vice portraying a more loose moralled character than the original.  If you want to see as it was written try Raffles: Complete Collection, the tv drama series from 1977,  the words are write out of Hornung's books, though they played with time and stories to make a very presentable version.
