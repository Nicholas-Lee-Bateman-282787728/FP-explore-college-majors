8548421,2,B00A8QBFKA,"Somewhat disappointing. I bought this for the Carnival of the Animals, but the work is not presented as written. Rather it is chopped up into segments. The other problem is that Saint-Saens' teasing of music critics with his hee-haw segment--calling them ""asses""--is mistakenly represented by live images of cute but inappropriate bunnies. In the other segments the animal videos and the music match. The music is pleasant as are the photos generally.",1442966400,,451,5.277777777777778
8548422,4,B00A8QBFKA,"A good performance of the Saint-Saens ""Organ"" Symphony, with an interesting video of a part of France I've read about but will likely never see.",1409616000,,144,4.8
8548423,5,B00A8QBFKA,Nice way to listen to good music and see beautiful places. It's a good birthday or Christmas gift for any age.,1403740800,,110,4.285714285714286
8548424,3,B00A8QBFKA,"I had hoped there would be more of it devoted to young children, and my intent was to introduce them to the music.
At least on my computer, the music was not loud enough to really make an impression.",1384041600,3,199,4.128205128205129
8548425,4,B00A8QBFKA,"Finding a decent DVD of colorful tone painting musical works like Saint-Saens's Carnival of the Animals is difficult. (In fact, that's true of quite a few works from the lighter side of the classical repertoire. So Naxos deserves credit for not only providing this and other modestly priced, creditably performed, and decently recorded lighter classical works, but for coupling them with videos of appropriately related scenes, in this case, Provence and a good Swiss zoo. We will be buying more in the ""Musical Journey"" series.",1366070400,4,528,5.223529411764706
