8332416,4,B001P807PO,"I was a big fan of the manga and decided to purchase this 'Complete Series' the moment I found out about it; although I'm disappointed this series did not get the same treatment most mangas get when turned into an anime (12 episodes...or more?), It was still presented very well in terms of deriving key points from the manga series. It may only be 6 episodes, but still good enough to make you tear-jerk (just like the 'Oh! My Goddess OAV's. =D)",1357171200,,446,4.451219512195122
8332417,4,B001P807PO,"well the first thing to note is watch the second disc first...the first disc i think occurs somewhere in the middle of the first disc but it is never referenced and really just feels weird and out of place.

the main plot is two characters want to confess their love for each other. simple enough and it generally speaking works. the problem is you have 6 episodes on disc 2 to accomplish this...5 of which are devoted to this plot. really by episode 4 knowing there isn't a lot more left you get the just get on with already. they do eventually succeed which leads to the 6th and final episode....this episode is rather good and has a rather well done finale which i think saves it.

the other thing is disc 1 has 6 episodes but disc 2 only has 2? the logic in that seems weird. also each disc has episode 1 and 2 but they are different episodes so it is hard until you watch it all to figure out the order of everything.

the good thing is how the story is told. the story is told fairly well. my main beef is it takes forever to get to its point. i understand people being shy. but seriously these two take 2-3 years of dancing around the fact that they like each other. there is also the fact a girl at the beginning plays off the main male character far better but she disappears after 2 episodes or so.

i rated this 4 stars because the ending is good, the story is told rather well, the animation is solid and overall its a fairly relaxing show to kick back with. the characters are all fairly likable for the most part. the story isn't hard to follow and it was just good to not have to think. my only real complaints are disc 1 doesnt fit anywhere and they take 5 episodes to get the main lovers together.

there is also the fact this is based on a manga which has far more volumes and 6 episodes is not enough but they make it work they do a good job of fleshing out the characters in these 6 episodes although the characters do for the most part stay the same till the last episode where they finally have some good character growth. the last episode really saves this thing from being terrible.",1355443200,,2106,4.202970297029703
8332418,3,B001P807PO,"Iori Hazuki is a beautiful high school girl with an acting career in the making. Ichitaka Seto is kind 0f wishy washy young fellow that has had a crush on Iori for a while. Itsuki Akiba is Ichitaka's  cute childhood friend who has returned from abroad. Put all three of them together and we have a tale of romance comedy and dreams. The course of true love never did run smooth, and hapless Ichitaka has tons of obstacles to overcome to win the heart of his classmate, Iori. Pranks, misunderstandings, stalkers, and  romantic intervention, but most of all trying to stay true to his feelings. Will they ever find happiness together, or will fate have other ideas?

This anime has a pretty good story, but the it was not played out all that well. The worst flaw this series has is the awful voice acting job. The English dub is ridiculous. I've definitely heard worse dubs before, but this one is still pretty bad. The comedy and drama is pretty mediocre too. I really do think that the concept is a great idea, and I like these type's of stories, but it seemed really half baked. Everything about I's, except the good animation is very mediocre.",1354579200,,1145,4.548543689320389
8332419,2,B001P807PO,"This is my first review, but after seeing this set of OVAs, I just had to write it. There are some possible spoilers ahead, so be forwarned.

My first impression of I's, when I started watching the first DVD was ""am I missing something here?"" To my surprise, the first DVD contains a set of episodes that take place sometime during the main story line (which happens to be the six episodes in the second DVD). The first DVD's story is not bad, but it does raise some questions and overall (after watching the second DVD) I don't feel it adds anything to the main story. A bit of super natural phenomena is added, and characters never mentioned before in the main story are introduced. Also, apparently, there is an abundance of rapist all over Japan.

Now, the second DVD is where we get to see how it all happened, as a series of flashbacks and present day events. Good natured guy falls in love with hot school idol and up-and-coming actress but doesn't have the guts to tell her how he feels. Childhood friend arrives from out of town, and declares her love for him, making things harder than they have to be, simply because of the weak male lead. Now, this is a typical anime love triangle, my complain however is how they decided to execute the story. The whole love triangle lasted a bit more than two episodes. And then it's just the guy triying to find courage to confess his feelings to the girl he loves, and then striving to make their relationship survive their daily lives. This all happens in a two year spand.

Overall, I felt the character development was done poorly. Either they were just trying to rush the story (after all, the manga is over 14 volumes long), or they simply wanted us to believe that during the course of 2 whole years, these seemingly ordinary people would never in their lives try to grow up a bit. Even the end of the story was a bit dissapointing, and it feels like they tried to force feed us a happy ending without having a real resolution. The message at the end was unclear and the characters remained flat throughout the entire story.",1269129600,,2080,4.468421052631579
8332420,4,B001P807PO,"The story is based on a manga. It has two disks, Japanese and English language tracks and subtitles. No extras.",1250467200,2,111,4.6
8332421,5,B001P807PO,I was a bit unsure about buying this anime since I have read mixed reviews but now I don't regret it. This set comes with I''s which is basically two OVA episodes which serve and some filler info and I''s Pure which is the main story. It'a a 6 episode long series that deals with the conflict between a guy unable to declare his love for a girl. On top of that his childhood friend arrives who also happens to be another girl and stirs up trouble between the two. Although it's a relatively short series it's done extremely well and has an astounding amount of depth to it. The last episodes are tear-jerkers and the ending leaves you satisfied. I highly recommend this anime to anybody as it won't disappoint!!,1249689600,,711,4.435114503816794
