8489890,1,B005ZOFJNY,"Actually neither of these guys have even the most basic understand or skill in the sport.  So to do a video called masters when they really don't even have the most basic understanding of the sport is seriously distrubing as people's lives are literally at risk.  Let's see either one of these guys try to reverse kite no hands for example.  They can't.  Let's see either one of them kite up a wall or a post and balance on top.  They can't because they don't have even the most basic skills themselves.  In this sport it's life & death critical that you LOOK at the skill level of whom you are taking advice from.  I'm quite simple as you can just search youtube for ""world's best paramotor pilot"" and pretty much every single video is of me.  It's not about bragging, it's about your life. It's just insane to see people pretending to be experts when they are not even close to experts.",1501632000,,888,4.404907975460123
