8504916,1,B006VA7C9A,Opening credits in Dementia 13 are  sideways on the screen.as though someone shot a bootleg copy while sitting in the audience. Anaglyphic 3d glasses are included. But the quality of both movies is so poor that 3d glasses cannot work.,1516147200,,234,4.85
8504917,1,B006VA7C9A,Poor quality picture and 3D no good.,1484524800,,36,4.285714285714286
8504918,2,B006VA7C9A,"This is not modern 3D. It uses the cardboard glasses with colored lenses and they are as uncomfortable as the image is clumsy. But, most annoying whether others agree with that or not, they only include one pair of glasses.  Are you supposed to pass them around. Other 3d movies I've purchased that required specific glasses included 4 pair. One pair is enough for 2 stars for me. This was not mentioned in the description.
I love this movie and was going to show it to friends. Since I didn't open it until people were over to watch it, it's too late to return it. Now, I'll just have to buy the basic b&w version which will probably be far more comfortable and enjoyable, anyway.",1463011200,,681,4.448
