7849394,3,6303511511,"The Summer of 1995, when WCW was already turning the corner to getting into the big time with the WWF, just a few months prior to Monday Nitro changing the game. This ppv was pretty decent--the 2 best matches being reserved for the end of the night; Sting & Meng in a good match for the vacant US title. And the main event--Savage and Flair--those 2 rarely put on a bad match.

Undercard was pretty decent--good arm wrestling segment with DDP and his old former bodyguard I completely forgot about (absolutely)...",1514851200,,513,4.637362637362638

I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find any VHS tapes, much less the tape he wanted. Thank you for making his birthday request a reality.",1466121600,,259,4.416666666666667

GREAT AMERICAN BASH 95

Spoilers

1. BRIAN PILLMAN VS ALEX WRIGHT-excellent opening match right here. These two put on a great show with the crowd really loving when Pillman would start to hit a little harder and get kinda  heelish. Great back and forth action with Wright gearing up more as it went on and Pillman hitting a little harder as it went on, great opening contest that sees Wright get the win with a counter to a sunset flip.

2.[ARM WRESTLING MATCH]DAVE SULLIVAN VS DDP-Kimberly and a bunny were on the line here in this arm wrestling contest. Good for what it is that sees the underdog Dave win and get the date with Pages girl.

3. JIM DUGGAN VS SGT. CRAIG PITMAN-better than I remembered and basically a brawl with some grappling intertwined. Good match that was entertaining with Pitman getting DQd for not letting go of an arm bar.

4. HARLEM HEAT VS BUNKHOUSE BUCK & DICK SLATER-Harlem Heat is probably my favorite tag team in WCW history. This was during the feud that would see Sherri and Parker get together eventually. This was a fun match that would see the Heat take the win in a creative way after Parker and Sherri get involved, love the ending here.

5.[TV TITLE]ARN ANDERSON VS THE RENEGADE-another match I didn't remember enjoying as much as I did now. I have always loved Arn but Renegade was pretty good here, Arn carried the match of course but still he did his part. Good match to put Warriroerr I mean Renegade over. He wins the TV title here in one of his better matches.

6.[TAG TITLE]THE NASTY BOYS VS THE BLUE BLOODS-this match for the tag titles was a cool brawl as both teams are hard hitters. The crowd was behind the champs chanting Nasty throughout as they did battle with the brits, I always loved Regal, still do. Anyway good match that sees Stevie Ray from Harlem Heat get involved only for it to backfire with the champs retaining.

7.[US TITLE]STING VS MENG-good match that was the finals of the US title tournament.  Was a beast during this time and Sting of course was always the most popular star in WCW. Good match of course with Sting eventually winning the vacant belt.

8. RANDY SVAVGE VS RIC FLAIR-Flair came out of retirement after attacking Savage and his father at events prior to this. The night opened with a great match and ended with one as the commentators even mention. These two had one of the greatest rivalries in wrestling history, from the WWF to WCW. This was a great mach and I loved how Savage played up the intensity like punching from his back. They both did great with the leg angle on Macho man. Eventually it was Savages fathers cane that Flair used to beat Randy on Fathers day. This was an excellent match, favorite of the night.

This was a good PPV and possibly the best on 95 from WCW. Great opener and closer with some good in-between, fun event from WCW.",1464912000,,2844,4.500970873786407
7849397,2,6303511511,"Another WCW tape I found here in the 1999 edition of Bash At The Beach.  This is one of those reviews where I just won't do a match by match analysis because I'll just end up repeating myself over & over again.  This was just an average WCW PPV with only two real standout matches in one being the WCW Tag Team Title match between the ""Jersey Triad"" (DDP, Kanyon, Bam Bam Bigelow) vs. Perry Saturn & Chris Benoit with the twist that all three members of the Triad can rotate in & out of the match with the third member on the floor...making it a glorified handicap match.  The other match was the Junkyard Hardcore Invitational where the rest of the roster who wasn't wrestling fought in an actual junkyard away from the arena with a bunch of moves & moments that you just have to see to believe to the point where half of the guys in this match were seriously injured afterwards.  The main event heavily showcased the big problem that has always existed in WCW...illogical booking as WCW Champion Kevin Nash had a tag team match with Sting vs. Randy Savage & Sid Vicious with the rule that anyone, including his partner Sting, who that pins Nash will become the WCW Champion...but for Sting to be legal in the match, Nash would have to tag him out which would then make Nash the illegal man so how could Sting win the title from Nash in the first place?  In the end, Randy Savage ended up winning the WCW Championship...only to lose it to Hulk Hogan the next night on Nitro (just like how he did almost a year earlier). The rest of the card featured matches that honestly just weren't good (Malenko/David Flair), forgettable (R. Steiner/Van Hammer), watchable (No Limit Soliders vs. West Texas Rednecks in which you would clearly hear that the Rednecks got the bigger pop than the Soldiers), average (the main event) to just matches that your either going to like or hate depending on your sense of humor (The Cat/Disco Infernio, Piper/Bagwell boxing match).  In the end, if you were a fan of the WCW product at this time, go ahead & get it at a cheap price but otherwise, this event you can pass on as you won't miss anything.",1221436800,,2128,4.4575835475578405
