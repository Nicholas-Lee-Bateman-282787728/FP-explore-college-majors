477364,5,6302510163,"I watched this on YouTube, and have ordered a copy for my collection as I believe it has historical value and is likely to disappear on line -- even though $18 for a 13 minute clip is a bit steep. This is a brilliant piece of investigative reporting that shines light on an issue that desperately needs it. I won't spoil it by telling you what they found, but I will repeat the title I gave this piece: You must see this!",1285632000,,421,4.146341463414634
477365,5,6302510163,"Thanks for putting this in a great format on DVD. Now I can finally erase the show from my DVR!  And, as a 2nd generation, life-long viewer, I will always cherish this.",1274659200,12,168,4.25
477366,5,6302510163,"An excellent DVD that not only reveals the power of the book it is adapted from, but has extras that are truly special. My advice: read the book, wait a few months; watch the DVD, wait a week; watch the DVD with McCourt's narration turned on, wait a week; watch the DVD with the director's narration turned on; put the book and DVD away for a year or two then repeat any or all of the steps.",1258848000,6,391,4.090909090909091
477367,5,6302510163,"This behind the scenes special on Guiding Light's finale was excellent. It captured the recent crew and cast going about the business
of creating the final episodes while experiencing great displays of personal emotions. I watched the show in the 1970's and 1980's and started watching again when I heard it would be cancelled. GL was unique in their production style (compared to all other current soaps) and the sheer longevity of many of the cast and crew
was remarkable. It's a shame how low ratings can dictate the fate of so many people. 60 minutes was on target in their interviews and overview of the show.
The segment was too short in time given the 72 years history of GL!",1256515200,20,682,4.644628099173554
477368,3,6302510163,"Interesting look. This takes the view of the pro-prohibitionist. They seem to have the opinion that these dispensaries are a problem. Always good to hear both sides. For the low price, it's definitely worth your time to watch it.",1256515200,,229,4.897435897435898

477370,4,6302510163,"James Bridges only made eight movies, all of them flawed but fascinating, and September 30, 1955 is as good a place as any to start to penetrate the heart of the mystery.  For one thing, it has the feel of an intensely personal, autobiographical film, heavily influenced by Truffaut and Cassavetes, and yet it is filled with unlikely contrivance and coincidence, and the two different modes never coalesce properly--but a remarkable tension builds between them.  Just when you're ready to write this one off, a moment of pure cinema drops in from out of nowhere to change your mind.  The movie is ""high concept"" to a degree, since it is all about what happens to Richard Thomas in the hours directly after James Dean's death in 1955.  Thomas plays Jimmy J, a sensitive young college student down South and a huge Dean fan.  We sometimes forget that when Dean died he had released only one big movie, East of Eden, and the two others that cemented his legend had yet to appear.  But he already had a legend, and Jimmy J wants to embody it, to serve it, like a first century Christian in a Cecil de Mille epic of Rome.

He is torn between two girls, the homecoming princess Charlotte, played by Deborah Benson, and the freaky Billie Jean (Lisa Blount, who unfortunately has to perform in the shadow of Susan Tyrell as her mom).  His friends include Tom Hulce and Dennis Christopher, both playing straight in this film, or somewhat straight, it's like Jimmy J has two little Platos running with him.  And then there's Dennis Quaid!  Jimmy J loves James Dean, Tom Hulce loves Richard Thomas, and Dennis just stands around looking gorgeous and glowering.

Bridges' films usually manage to get his leading man down to his underwear and in September 30, 1955 he takes this structural element to extremes, it's almost as though, distraught by Dean's death, Jimmy J can't seem to remember that boys wear pants.  Is this a good thing or a bad thing?  Depends on how you feel about the former ""John Boy"" trying, through sheer acting concentration, to summon up a single ounce of sexual charisma.  The movie uses (""borrows"") snatches of Leonard Rosenman's famous Dean theme and sometimes this seems a bit heavyhanded, and yet one forgives this movie almost everything simply because it's so odd and ambitious.",1224547200,7,2297,4.753148614609572
477371,5,6302510163,Prior to watching this video I would advise reading the author's book Angela's ashes or you will certainly miss the more humorous aspect of conversations.,1198108800,10,154,5.2
477372,4,6302510163,"My favorite thing about it is I feel that it gives you a very vivid, emotional clear view of what it must have been like to be a James Dean fan while he was living and the enormous impact it had on his fans when he died. I also like the general atmosphere of the film.",1129420800,5,268,3.8035714285714284

7827233,5,6302510163,"I watched GL from the time we first had tv - and it was shown for 15 minutes - then upped to 30 and later to 60.  I cried when Charita Bauer passed away and followed all the cast and characters to the point where I felt they were really my family.  I find it inconceivable that quality television such as this should have been allowed to die a premature death and I thank 60 Minutes for spending their time with the GL folks.

As far as the seller goes, they're tops too.  This came quickly and was just as they said it would be, so I thank them.",1381622400,2,546,3.981651376146789

7827235,3,6302510163,"This is very nice portrait of the author of the Harry Potter books, J.K. Rowling. It contains little news for the real fans, though, and the price without discount is a bit steep for a documentary of less than 40 minutes, but seeing as there are not many of these around, a real fan with a sense of nostalgia may think it's worth it. Others may just think the documentary 'One year in the life...' (as found on the 2-disk DVD edition of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince) enough.
5 stars for quality, a half star less because it's a bit dated, and 1.5 star less because it's short.",1291680000,2,586,4.336363636363636
7827236,5,6302510163,"I was a lifelong Guiding Light fan and was deeply saddened by its cancellation. I was on Amazon and just typed in Guiding Light DVD, and found this item. And, am I glad I did!!! I watched the segment when it aired on 60 Minutes last year, but apparently I missed some of it, because when I watched the DVD, I saw interviews I must have missed. This item is great for GL fans and it comes in a standard DVD case of the quality you would find in stores, which was more than I initally expected. Thank you Amazon for offering this product and I will definitely make more purchases!",1291161600,6,578,4.216216216216216
