7361707,4,B013C6OXCY,"This is a very good supernatural horror/thriller film. The basic story is a rookie police office on her first day on the job get assigned to a police station that's closing down & strange things begin to occur. Small cast so not many people in the film which adds to the feeling of isolation. The atmosphere & mood in this film was very good, the sense of dread was also very well done. The effects were very well done as well. There are a few very creepy moments to be had & even an eerie little song also. Some of the sequences almost seem like the character is in a nightmare, no bad CGI found here either, practical effects & makeup only. If you are looking for a good supernatural film you really cant go wrong with this film, it was really well done. This also happens to be the 3rd film ive seen in recent weeks that deal with supernatural things happening in police stations 1st was The Traveler (which I liked) 2nd was Let Us Prey (which I didn't like). Id say definitely give this film a chance, one of the better modern supernatural films ive seen in a while.",1443916800,3,1070,4.301980198019802
7361708,4,B013C6OXCY,"Wow. Finally a decent horror film, thats creepy, bloody, and downright disturbing at times. A horror film that doesnt use CGI, but old-school makeup. A brilliant trip into a darkened insanity that comes off as something classic style evil. I really liked this movie. It gets huge accolades from me in that it used the old style of sounds, noises, combined space, darkness, and truly awesome makeup and gore. I was thoroughly shocked and satisfied with this film. It was morbid and gave off the vibes of creepiness. The best way to experience this film, is turn off the lights, turn the volume up, and enter into a trip of hell.

The story is clichd in the reality, an alone women in a vacant place. This has Rookie officer Jessica Loren in the last shift of a closing Police Station. Soon all kinds of strange things begin to happen. Phone calls, banging noises, a homeless man, doors opening and closing, and then flashes of people, things, objects. Officer Loren thinks at first her fellow officers, are playing with the rookie, but soon, the evening late shift turns into a spiraling insanity. Officer Loren must survive the night. The back story is that her father was killed a year before during an arrest, of an occult leader and his followers. The leader, killed women, and worshiped an Evil older than the Devil.

This is a fantastic throwback to the old days of 80s horror films. There is a slick reality of John Carpenter, a somewhat homage to Prince of Darkness and Assault on Precinct 13th, or at least I felt it was. The homeless man reminded me of Alice Coopers character in John Carpenters Prince of Darkness.

I felt this was a welcome to old school 80s horror at its best. The bloody makeup and effects are truly memorable. The structure of the film is so dreadful. The darkness is like a living thing in the film, it gets under your skin. There is a dark, nightmarish evil in the premise of the film. I felt that the direction, along with the story, and the overall execution was dynamite.

Directed by Anthony DiBlasi. DiBlasi directed one of my favorite underrated horror films, 2009s Dread. DiBlasi has crafted a film that has all the trademarks of an 80s film gore, yet mixes the old-school 50s and 60s noises, and creepy sounds around darkness. The un-seeable slowly gets to you. He also adds a modern concept to the film. What I like about DiBlasi, is that he knows the horror world, and displays it in vivid detail. He adds many realities of horror into Last Shift. He co-wrote this film with writer Scott Poiley. Both DiBlasi and Poiley have worked together several times.

Last Shift is a brutal executed insanity, that leaves you the viewer, in a state of tension. Slowly rides itself up your spine, causing goosebumps, and has you looking over your shoulder.

Starring Juliana Harkavy. She was fantastic in her part. She made you believe the ordeal. Harkavys acting I felt captured the dread, darkness, and the suffering. She was able to hold your attention throughout her ordeal. That's another thing about this film, it was a one person performance in a sense. There were others throughout the film, but she mainly was alone at times, like the old horror films, where the tension builds through your main character. Harkavy was able to create the whole film around herself. The tight direction allowed the viewer to walk with her, pace with her in the darkness, and the unravelling of her sanity.

Something else I have to mention is the spooky, worshipping, Devil persons. The leader played by Joshua Mikel and his ladies, played by, Sarah Sculco, Kathyrn Kilger, Mary Lankford Poiley. All of them played perfect, creepy parts of insanity. A dark, evil nature displayed wonderful through acting performances. Each character was executed flawless through special effects and makeup. Now I have to mention the character of Bashed Face Betty. This character was creepy, and very gory in the makeup, with an added sense of a Japanese Ghost in sounds and noises, such as the film Ju-on: The Grudge. Bashed Face Betty was played by Lindsi Jeter and she captured a creepy, disturbing, and twisted moment.

This also has a veteran actor in the small part of Sergeant Cohen. Hank Stone has been acting since the early 80s. He is one of those actors that plays many characters, you might not know his name, but you know his face. Playing both small screen and big screen. Playing many villains for TV and movies. I always enjoy seeing actors who clearly can act, and own their characters, and yet sadly are never given the lime light they deserve, but thankfully there are films that allow performances by many underrated performers, and Last Shift is one of those. This also has another actor that has been in many films since starting in the late 90s, J. LaRose in the part of the homeless man. He too has acted in both TV and Film, including other horror films like, Saw 3 and 4, Repo! The Genetic Opera, Insidious, Mothers Day, and many others, including working with the director of Last Shift in his other films, Cassadaga, Missionary. Both Hank Stone and J. LaRose are very gifted actors.

This movie is not for everyone. Its geared mainly to horror fans that understand the old-school sense of frights through noises, abandoned buildings, satanic realities, awesome makeup and effects.

I loved this film. I was entertained and taken back to the days when horror was about fear, dread, scary moments, sounds, hand done makeup, and not crappy CGI.

Yes the movie has many clichs thats been done before, but in my viewpoint that does not take away from it, I feel its paying Homage to the greats. Its exploring the fear and dread of horror.

7361710,5,B013C6OXCY,"This movie has kind of the same initial set-up as Assault on Precinct 13. Ive always felt that movie had a kind of supernatural vibe to it that was unspoken so seeing this movie was like watching that actually play out. Definitely not a rip, just a similar starting off point. I actually see this movie as kind of crossed with another Carpenter classic, In the Mouth of Madness. Not anything story wise at all, but instead just delving so deep into the unknown with twisted visuals that the viewer themselves starts to feel a little crazy like the main character. The acting is great, direction is great and story unfolds quite nicely in a very methodical and enjoyable way. The visuals are absolutely wonderful and there is a fantastic suspense that permeates the screen. This movie came out of nowhere for me and it ended up being a real treat. Great stuff. 4.5/5",1442880000,4,865,4.623376623376624

It's scarier and better than most of the crappy horror films that come out today (with a few exceptions) and its very well made with great acting, atmosphere and some truly terrifying moments. The whole film is suspenseful and keeps you guessing. I'm a massive horror film fan and I've seen hundreds and hundreds of horror films and this is one of the great ones.

7361724,5,B013C6OXCY,"Definitely a creepy flick. I expected something with a horror take on ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, because the Carpenter influences are here. But it takes on it's own vibe as a rookie female cop closes a police station on its last night... of course it's filled with evidence from a Manson-esque cult that just happened to self-sacrifice themselves in said police station.

A lot of reviews will complain about the ending, and I do feel it could've been better, but it's not a bad ending, I just think most viewers were on the high that I was, where they movie was wrapped up in a nice neat bow when I was ready for another hour or intense terror.

7361732,4,B013C6OXCY,"I was over at my friend Jessicas house when we decided to watch this one. I thought she might enjoy it since she works at the jail, but working such weird hours, she fell asleep. So I got to enjoy this one mostly by myself.

First, I have to say, Thank You! for making a horror movie that is mostly well lit. Except for a few scenes when it is completely pitch black (and its to enhance the tension in the film), you can see well enough to know what is going on.

The tension was perfectly paced, and Juliana Harkavy, who plays Jessica, the rookie cop, does a wonderful job in slowly melting down and losing her mind. I don't normally seek out movies just because of a particular actor, but I would like to see if Juliana does as well in other movies that she is in.

A wonderful job was done on the make-up and special effects. It wasn't loaded down with CGI, as they went more old school for this film. One thing that always creeps me out is when characters in a film a jerky, and this film had lots of that going on. But not so much that I got nauseous. Two other movies that I really enjoy and have this effect are House on Haunted Hill (1999) and Thirteen Ghosts (2001).

There were two parts that I had a bit of a problem with; at the beginning when Jessica gets there to start her shift and the Sergeant is yelling and hitting the wall. I still don't understand why he was doing this. Unless it was just because he had just experienced some of the paranormal activity.
I was thinking/hoping that it would come full circle at the end, but I don't see how it would.

The other thing was that the end of the movie happened really fast, and I felt that there could have been more added to it. But maybe they left it a bit more open ended to make a part two.

All in all, a great horror movie. If you enjoy haunted buildings, paranormal activity, cults and people slowly going crazy, this film may be one that you enjoy.",1454112000,,1922,4.16711590296496

7361737,5,B013C6OXCY,"* spoilers *

Officer Jessica Loren's first day of work involves her being a glorified security guard, much to her disappointment. The only reason a police officer needs to stay and babysit an empty police station is that a hazmat team is set to pick up the biohazardous evidence between the hours of 10pm and 4am. On the surface, this seems like an easy but dull task foisted off on a rookie cop for her first assignment As the night goes on, unexplainable things happen with increasing intensity having to do with the circumstances surrounding her father's death. Is she going crazy or is there something supernatural at work going on?

Last Shift is a very unexpected film that I just stumbled across on Netflix. I expected a typical horror film that was marginally enjoyable, but it exceeded all of my expectations and more. The film starts a little off kilter. When Officer Loren gets to the station, the Sergeant acts strangely, which is easily brushed off. The tense mood is heightened by startling events that get harder and harder for her to explain away. It starts with flickery lights, loud noises, a seriously disgusting bathroom, and a weirdly long hair in her sandwich. Then it escalates to an erratic homeless man, a frantic phone call from a girl under attack, an eerie song sung over her radio, and things that move by themselves. A lot of these events happen in quick succession, heightening the suspense. One of the best scenes is when she locks up the homeless man in a holding cell after he enters the station twice. The door slams shut behind her, startling her into dropping her flashlight. The room is pitch dark and her flashlight is shined in her face and rolled around to three different unseen people in the room as they taunt her in barely audible voices. The scene makes the viewer as disoriented and creeped out as the main character. Another scene is filmed close to Officer Loren's face as she desperately tries to help a girl running from murderers. Every emotion plays across her face. These two scenes in particular both heighten the mood of the film and puts us in her shoes and make us feel what she feels with unique cinematography choices and good acting.

Officer Loren takes the majority of these things in stride. She keeps a cool head through much of the film even in the face of the unexplainable. Her drive is to prove herself and to be the best police officer she can be. Instead of praying, she recites the law enforcement oath she took to uphold the law and have integrity and responsibility as a police officer. It shows how steeped in reason she is and how dedicated she is to her career, which she shares with her deceased father. Unfortunately, she doesn't really know how to process all of the strange things going on, so she ends up dismissing them as delusions or simply rejecting them because they don't fit into her world view until it's too late. I appreciate a woman in a horror film who isn't totally hysterical or irrational as they are often portrayed. Officer Loren has training for stressful and dangerous situations and utilizes it well. Many times, she experienced insane, horrific events and then interacted with people fairly normally not long afterwards. The only thing she acts irrationally about is her job. Most people would have just left, but her drive to continue her father's legacy overrides logic. Unlike many horror films, Officer Loren isn't cut off from everyone. She can call anyone at any time and can freely leave the building, but who is going to believe her? She can't prove what's happening and anything she tries to explain sounds like a prank or insanity. In the quiet moments between the nightmarish episodes, she contemplates calling someone, leaving, or simply waiting in her car, but something always brings her back in and she dismisses mentioning the strange events directly to anyone she interacts with until the very end. I especially enjoyed that the main dilemma of the film is centered around the inability to explain the supernatural rather than the protagonist's ineptitude.

The supernatural episodes make sense after a prostitute named Marigold hanging around outside shares that she was in a holding cell when a wannabe Manson family called the Paymon's were brought in and killed themselves inside their cell. Marigold is surprisingly fleshed out for her short screen time. She is irrepressibly cheerful despite the fading shiner on her face, but her whole demeanor breaks when she describes the song the Paymon's sang and their suicide. It's clear how deeply the event affected her. Public records states that the criminals were killed at the crime scene and only few people know they were interviewed and then killed themselves. Presumably, the events are caused by their ghosts. Like the Manson family, they have a charismatic leader who his followers will do absolutely anything for. They view him as the second coming of King of Hell, who is different than Satan. Satan is God's lapdog, who still carries out his commands. The King of Hell was there before Satan, will be there after, and demands the sacrifice of innocents. The Paymon's surety, fanaticism, and fervor are frightening and they are no less so as apparitions (if that's what they are) especially when they sing their song. Officer Loren's father died during the raid trying to save the teenaged victims. Obviously, she has a lot of emotions about the event and it may be causing her to lose her mind and hallucinate. Other people's accounts point to strange events, but this is all through Officer Loren's unreliable point of view. The ending is rather ambiguous, but tragic all around.

Last Shift is a stressful film to watch. It's easy to put yourself in Officer Loren's shoes as she tries to not only survive but make sense of the situation. There are moments of humor or boredom to break up the tension, but I felt shaken after watching and I kept thinking about it days afterwards. The twists and turns keep coming even during the lulls and I had no idea where it was going to end up. Juliana Harkavy does an excellent job of portraying competent and logical Jessica Loren as she deals with supernatural forces or descends into madness, depending on how you interpret the film. Natalie Victoria had about 5 minutes of screen time, but made Marigold into a fully fleshed out character. The Paymon's, portrayed by Joshua Mikel, Sarah Scuclo, and Kathryn Kilger, made their characters stand out as cheerfully evil and unphased by capture, threats, or even death. Last Shift is on Netflix at the moment, so I recommend that you give it a watch if you haven't already.",1452988800,,6646,4.811023622047244

For whatever reason, this movie did it. I jumped several times, I couldn't look away, I even made my girlfriend come in from the other room to finish watching it with me.

7361784,5,B013C6OXCY,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

With the glut of horror films coming out on a near weekly basis these days it is rare to find a movie that is original, scary and that gives you the willies at the same time. There have been a number in the past year that critics have hailed as doing so but for me they were still lacking. So when I came across a small, independent horror film that made me cringe every now and then you can bet it was one I couldn't wait to recommend.

LAST SHIFT starts off as a regular movie, almost a tribute to films like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 and RIO BRAVO. Rookie cop Jessica Loren (Juliana Harkavy) gets her first assignment, to man the closing precinct station on its last night in business. Her first odd encounter is with the sergeant in charge turning it over to her. To say he acts a bit off is an understatement. He informs her that all incoming calls have been directed to the new station, that a bio team will be there in the morning to pick up the remaining evidence packets on hand and that all she has to do is watch the building in case someone comes to the door. Simple, right?

But things don't go as planned. To begin with, Jessica hears strange noises coming from the building. But then every old building makes noise. Her phone rings and its a young woman claiming that her life is in danger, that she just escaped from someone. Before she can get a location the line cuts off. Jessica calls the new precinct and they tell her to get the location next time.

During the night a homeless man turns up at the door. Jessica lets him in and he returns to favor by using the front area as a urinal. She takes him down and locks him in a cell, returning to her desk. Along the way she still hears more noises. On occasion when she hears these sounds and goes to investigate, we the viewer see strange things over her shoulder. But when Jessica turns, there is nothing there. Its an unnerving image used throughout that keeps the viewer on their toes.

There is something strange going on in this precinct that Jessica is unaware of and it isn't until late in the film its revealed but by that time we have a clue what it is. A year prior to this night the leader of a local cult was brought in and locked up along with several of his followers. The cult was one that killed people and once they were locked up things happened that are left unexplained to this day. Has someone snuck into the precinct to use the legend of this cult to their advantage or is something more malevolent going on? Not only that, Jessica eventually gets a call from her father during the night telling her to stay at her station. Except that her father, a decorated police officer himself, has been dead for a while now.

The movie uses the claustrophobic nature of being trapped inside a building you have no ability to leave to its advantage. The same holds true with a character who is responsible and takes her duty seriously. Jessica may want to leave but her job, her first job as an officer, is to stay and defend the building from anyone who might try to do something to it. But in fulfilling her duty she may end up becoming nothing more than another part of the legend of the building, another stain on the wall.

Harkavy, an actress with only 23 roles under her belt (one of those being on THE WALKING DEAD) does a remarkable job here. While there are others actors on view she takes up the majority of screen time here. If she wasn't a capable actress it would make the part unbelievable. Trust me when I say that before this night is over you will believe that she is indeed Officer Jessica Loren and you will sympathize with her predicament.

The movie has some well-done special effects but those are the centerpiece of the story. They heighten what comes near the end and in various moments but it is the story itself that holds our interest. The old adage that showing less makes something all the more scary holds true here. As someone whos seen tons of horror films let me say that this one had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. Of course that was a seat well clear of the TV screen so I didn't jump too far.

While major studios spend tons of money to make the next big blockbuster film with the intent of scaring you, the fact is they're more focused on remakes and sequels, movies that you pretty much know what to expect while watching. Not so with this film. Its one movie thats as original as they come. That makes it not just a gem of a film but a movie that will haunt your dreams after the final credits roll.",1445904000,,4602,4.292626728110599

7361788,2,B013C6OXCY,"I wanted to watch a horror movie, and based on the reviews this one seemed like it would be a good watch. I was very disappointed. The actress is very stoic, her reactions to what is happening during this shift is quite pathetic honestly. There's no emotion. Being alone in an abandoned police station that's being haunted by a satanic cult should at least terrify and distress you, but as she received calls from a dead girl and saw images of bloody demons, the police woman remained relatively unphased. I found this movie boring and silly, but at least the makeup was alright.",1445558400,2,579,4.631067961165049

7361791,3,B013C6OXCY,"I had seriously high hopes for this movie. ""Last Shift"" starts out with nearly the exact same plot setup as John Carpenter's ""Assault on Precinct 13"" (the first one, not the Ethan Hawke sequel). If you're not familiar with the trope: a rookie cop (first night on the force) is assigned to watch over a dilapidated old police station. All hell breaks loose.

Unfortunately, this movie lacks all the tact, pacing, and plot of John Carpenter's amazing film. Instead, we are treated to a mashup plot of that movie ""When a Stranger Calls"" (""check the children"") and a low-budget zombie/ghost/ax-wielding-maniac b-minus horror bomb.

I gave the movie three stars on the strength of the main actress cop lady. She's a strong actress who carries the film along nearly all by herself, unaided by a horrible script, bad editing, bad directing, and a poor story. She has that kick-ass Michelle Rodriguez edge to her (which makes her perfect for the part of a cop) and the beauty of what I imagine the love child of Jessica Alba and Jennifer Carpenter would look like.

The movie is just dumb. They have this perfect setting (creepy empty police station) and one assumes they've seen ""Assault"" (even the remake with Morpheus was more interesting than this).

I love horror movies. Just look at my other reviews. My bar for what constitutes an effective horror movie is so low that other reviewers typically think I'm crimping 5-star ratings for money or something. Well, I'm not. What I'm trying to say is this movie disappointed me because it had all the potential in the world and they blew what could have been a horror classic. I mean seriously, Assault on Precinct 13 + Zombies should be a GREAT movie, but this one was just boring.

7361792,5,B013C6OXCY,"Office Jessica Loren's first shift leaves her tasked with guarding the old Police Station which has been moved out of for better digs; no one is around with the lead actress and there really isn't much left within the station itself except some evidence. The evidence happens to be from an old case where some cultists went around a killed some young girls.

The film starts a bit slow, and most of the beginning is just creepy noises but slowly Officer Loren starts to see things and you're left wondering if someone is messing with her or she's losing it, which at that point she wonders the same thing as well. The film keeps the tension up and I found the pacing to be great, the actors were also fantastic.

The only downsides I found where things sometimes got too by-the-numbers and the station itself is a little boring to look at, it's literally a serious of white walls and rooms and since everyone moved out there's nothing to really make one room different from the next.

Overall it's a solid film, I think any horror buff would be able to enjoy it.",1445385600,,1062,4.492227979274611

7361795,4,B013C6OXCY,"Have you seen a lot of supernatural horror movies?  If so, then you know how cliched the genre is.  A couple/single mother and kid/s move into a home/apartment that was inexplicably in their price range.  Odd stuff happens, usually noticed first by the youngest characters.  Females characters are usually written off as hysterical on account of some tragic death they've recently experience.  Despite this, they struggle to solve the mystery of the entity's identity and later confront it.  There are hundreds of subtle permutations on the recipe, but horror fans could list off at least a dozen films that fit this mould.  For those who watch those movies with the yearning for something fresh, I can say that Last Shift is for you.  In a year that's seen a lot of strong horror films, this one stands out for its twist on the haunted house recipe that, more often than not, leaves me wanting.  Watch this movie.

Normally, at this point I would give some spoiler-free summary of the story.  I won't do that.  I think it's best to go into this movie with as few expectations as possible.  What I will say is that the story is perfectly paced, moving through tension and then releasing it masterfully.  Writer/director Anthony DiBlasi and co-writer Scott Poiley clearly understand how to build momentum, and by the end, Last Shift seems like an unstoppable juggernaut.  Juliana Harkavy has the screen to herself most of the time, and she owns every second of it.  She perfectly portrays a character who is strong willed and dutiful, but she lets the cracks show just enough to make it believable.  The supporting actors were all extremely good as well, but the real co-start of the film is the audio.  While light on visual effects, the horror is made effective by the creaks, groans, slams, and whispers of the old police station.  The music, composed by Adam Barber, was exactly what a modern horror score should be - out of the way, but somehow completely necessary.  If I have one complaint about this movie, it's that the ending - and by this, I mean the very last minute - seems so out-of-place, and it brings all of that wonderful momentum to a crashing halt.  While disappointing, I won't say that it ruins an otherwise perfect horror experience, and if you consider yourself even a casual fan of the genre, you need to watch Last Shift.",1444953600,8,2346,4.714987714987715
7361796,3,B013C6OXCY,"I had big hopes for this movie.  At about 40 minutes in I had no idea where the film was going.  It felt original and very suspenseful.  [It should have the end rewritten and then be re-filmed from about an hour on.]  With an original and great ending, this could become an example of what a horror film should be.  But in the end They just copped out for the: ""You have been deluded by the evil spirits.  Hahaha... we got ya.  The end""
  This was not a high budget film, but that's no excuse for a run of the mill ending.
  Plot:  Years ago a Manson-esk group were caught, and they cast a curse- an all [and their loved ones] that would try to stop them.  The press was never told the real story of their deaths.  Present day- the daughter of one of the main cops, in that case, is going to start her first shift [as a rooky cop].  It just so happens that she will watch the old precinct for it's final night.  [All 911 calls are to be sent to the new precinct.]  She's alone and weird things start to happen.  She's getting calls for help and assumes that they are present time.  We learn little intricacies about the real story.  At an hour, of so, into the film the script writer(s) quit.  The film was finished with the standard boiler plate: ghost, horror story finish.
  Their 'yellow brick road' never led to a great place, it ended at a manure filled pig pen.  But the first 40 minutes to an hour are really good.  The acting was very good.  I didn't like the location but it was adequate.",1444867200,3,1498,4.186619718309859
