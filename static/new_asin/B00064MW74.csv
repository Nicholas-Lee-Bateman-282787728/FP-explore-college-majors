2167083,5,B00064MW74,"Its about time that they released the next chapter in the ER series.  For anyone who is a fan of the series, this is an absolute must have.  ER is one of the greatest shows to be put on television, and the third season is when the show starts to get great.",1110326400,10,256,3.9038461538461537
2167084,5,B00064MW74,"I buy the asian DVD releases through Ebay and have seen every season except for 4 and 9+. This is an excellent season and I am so glad that WB is finally doing US releases for it. I am waiting patiently for a season 4 to come out as that is very very hard to find in an asian edition. For those of you who can't wait, you can always check out ebay for asian editions. They play in English, are completely compatible with US DVD players, and the menus are very very easy to guide through. Just like watching a US released edition :)",1110240000,7,531,4.066666666666666
2167085,5,B00064MW74,"It's about time! I've been waiting for this for almost a year. ER is the greatest show on tv and making people wait one year is unfair. I can understand why it took so long this time if it was to change the release format from two sided to one sided discs, but now that they have that worked out, I would like to see them release these more quickly. Note to Warner dvd, I AM EAGER TO BUY EVERY SEASON OF ER. Keep releasing them. I will be even more eager to buy them now that the price is lower. This is part one of a two part review. Part two will be written after the dvd is released and I watch the entire third season. I like forward to it. Note to ER writers: I'm getting tired of the whinning about conservatives and the Bush bashing. Lighten up a little. Other than that, you are still doing a terrific job with the show, keep up the great work. Note to ER fans, even casual ones: ORDER THIS DVD SET. ER doesn't disappoint.",1110153600,7,930,4.059782608695652
2167086,3,B00064MW74,"i do agree that the release schedule really  a problem for all ER fans since it takes too long time between releasing another season.

meanwhile, according to  another user review above, i found that there's already ER Season 3, AND ALSO SEASON 4 available in Australia, [...] since i found that the total minutes of ER Season 3 IN RED and IN GREEN are DIFFERENT!! (the Green one in Australia is a bit shorter!) please help and let me decide if I purchase the Australia version! thx.",1109980800,,483,4.528735632183908
2167087,5,B00064MW74,"ER has been on a slow release schedule presumably because they don't sell well.  Other reasons could include DVD-production time and music rights, but those don't seem particularly convincing in this case.  Chances are, if a studio has an older property that's making money hands over fist, they're going to take advantage of it.  Personally I'm looking forward to this season because it has one of my favorite episodes, in which Julianna Margulies meets Ewan McGregor in a corner drugstore.",1109548800,6,491,5.1125
2167088,5,B00064MW74,"What are you all complaining about?!!

ER doesn't have the lastability of most shows, huh?

The Red box is turning you off?

What the hell are you talking about???? Have any of you actually seen this programme? ER is one of the finest television shows ever made, and it never failed to amaze in these early seasons. So stop complaining and just buy it. It has endless lastability.",1109462400,6,380,4.5588235294117645
2167089,4,B00064MW74,"I too am a fan of the show and have fallen short on this long term release as well.  I'm sort of disapointed in the red box deal, I think that it looks better, but they should have started it to begin with.  Anyways, it's amazing how enthusiastic a person can get just waiting for the release of a daytime series that I could easily watch on the telly.

I guess when I think about it though ER really is the only daytime drama that I can sit through, so to have it at my disposal at times would be assuring.  Only gave it 4 stars for the box change and the fact that I haven't seen the third season yet.",1109203200,,603,3.958677685950413
2167090,4,B00064MW74,"I love this show and am eager to purchase all seasons as they come out on DVD.  My only question/concern is, why does it take so long between seasons?  It has been more than 6 months, if not closer to a year when season 2 came out.  Other TV show's seasons come out more quickly between seasons.  Anybody have any answers?",1109030400,4,322,4.229508196721311
2167091,5,B00064MW74,"I was able to buy the third series of E.R. at Christmas here in Australia. It was available through one of the major department stores, and I'm a bit surprised that you folks in the USA have yet to have it released.

What can I say, but if you are an avid ER fan like myself, you will find yourself a real couch potato as you sit and watch each of these episodes. It deals with Jeannie Boulet and her fight against HIV, the ongoing romance with Carol Hathaway and Doug Ross, the ever critical and much disliked Kerry Weaver, and of course Dr Benton and his romance with Carla Reese.

I have got to be one of ER's greatest fans down under, and can highly recommend that you US fans obtain this 3rd series release of this wonderful show.

I'm now eagerly awaiting Season 4 and 5 to be released, hopefully sometime this year. Hint, hint!

ER is the GREATEST!!",1108857600,,856,4.298136645962733

be on the dvd machine. But as I go through the seasons ( I am now in season 7) it seems that I have come to see that there is at least one defective (usually more) in each season. That is disappointing as they are very expensive. I have wanted the entire set for as long
as I could remember. And spending this amount of money I would expect that it would not be defective. Also one of the sets had a sticker that said used. So I didn't even get that season new. So yes there is some disappointment in ordering this product from Amazon as I've come to expect high quality and customer service from them.",1392422400,,872,4.105263157894737
2167351,4,B00064MW74,"Third season of ER.  More sick people, more drama, more everything.  But I still like it (and it's a good thing since there are several more seasons to go!).

ER is about a busy Chicago emergency room.  One where the doctors are overworked and underpaid but still try to do their best to help everyone who comes in their doors.  But that doesn't mean they're without their own drama.  Susan Lewis misses her niece little Susie and has to decide where her path in life will go.  Carter struggles with surgery and what he wants to do in medicine.  Mark deals with depression and aggression and has a pretty lackluster year.  And Benton gets involved with a girl and gets a little more than he bargained for.

Characters:
Anthony Edwards: Dr. Mark Greene
George Clooney: Dr. Doug Ross
Sherry Stringfield: Dr. Susan Lewis
Noah Wyle: Dr. John Carter
Julianna Margulies: Carol Hathaway
Gloria Reuben: Jeanie Boulet
Laura Innes: Dr. Kerry Weaver
Eriq La Salle: Dr. Peter Benton

The characters are what drive this show.  There are plenty of other medical shows out there, but this one puts the medicine in second place.  So it's a good thing they have a great cast.  All of whom which are relatable.  Mark Greene is my favorite.  Edwards plays him well in all his moods.  And Wyle as Carter is always endearing.  He has a few flaws, but he's cute and tries hard.  My least favorite is probably Dr. Susan Lewis.  They just jerk her story around so much that you become tired of it after awhile.  Especially with all the drama between her and Mark.

There is some gore and blood and general medical stuff in this show.  It's about an ER after all.  Sensitive stomachs could have trouble with that.  But as I said before, the show is more about the characters so the rest seems secondary.  The episodes generally span a whole year in the ER.  Starting and ending in summer.  And because of the Christmas episodes I always associate this show with the holidays.  Which probably seems kind of strange, but there's just something comforting about them in winter.  Maybe it's the thought of people being healed by doctors.

Still love the show.  Can't wait to start the fourth season!

2167352,5,B00064MW74,I loved this series until Anthony Edwards leaves the show.  The DVD arrived in good condition at a great price.,1385164800,,111,4.55
2167353,5,B00064MW74,"I can hardly improve on many of the reviews for this season, so I will just mention those things I like best.

At the top of the list is the chance to see several actors, early in their career, who later became prominent in other series. At the top of the list in this season are Jorja Fox, Khandi Alexander, and Omar Epps, who went on to supporting leads in CSI, CSI:Miami and House respectively. I am less thrilled with the new face in senior management, Dr. Donald Anspaugh, played by John Aylward, as something of a hard headed bottom line kind of administrator, especially since he replaces William H. Macy as the face of the hospital administration. His personality softens just a bit in the course of the year, but the sharp edges surface every once in a while.

The stories are taking the lead actors out of the ER in medical crisis situations, such as in local stores, and in ride alongs in EMT ambulances and in helicopters. They are also dealing more often with situations of medical ethics regarding HIV status, race relations, and DNR (do not resuscitate) orders.

One major character, who may have been the weakest in the first two seasons, leaves the cast, and Laura Innes' character becomes more central to the story arcs dealing with the hospital administration. As I expected from season one, John Carter's character growth continues, mostly advancing, but sometimes taking a step backwards.

The lead character whose role I enjoy the most is Julianna Margulies as Nurse Carol Hathaway. It seems as if every major character has gone through some kind of professional and personal  crisis in the first three seasons, and Hathaway's are the hardest to take. She is the one character I most want to see succeed, along with Noah Wyle's John Carter.

I do not recommend your starting with season 3, as most of the relations between characters and character roles will seem unfinished. Season 3 is just as good as season 2, and that's saying a lot.",1384819200,2,1960,4.716374269005848

Seasons 1 and 2 established the characters and season 3 begins to delve further into their lives. Season 3 deserves recognition as the first season in which the show had complete confidence in itself. It is more intense, more bloody, and more gritty than seasons 1 and 2. The performances are great and it's no wonder many of the cast moved on to much larger parts in movies and television. It's a must buy.",1277164800,,558,4.534653465346534

I never gave it much thought. Recently I was at her house and season one box set was on her counter, so I decided to give it a shot. I'm now up to season five and am addicted. One episode ends and you have to put on one more. The show is THAT good. Character driven shows (and movies) have always drawn me to them. ER is just one of those shows that has everything from good drama to romance and real life crisis.

Other shows that I never watched until they hit box set were: 24, Star Trek Next Generation and X-files. All those years I never knew what I was missing.",1254182400,,727,4.048611111111111

Doug Ross (George Clooney) is forced to confront his callous womanizing.  Peter Benton (Eriq LaSalle) becomes the father of a premature baby whose birth has frightening complications.  Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) endures money problems, career doubts, romantic setbacks, and a hostage situation.  In one of the most affecting story threads, Jeannie Boulet (Gloria Reuben) adjusts to her HIV positive status and reconnects with her ex-husband (Michael Beach).  The large cast of fully realized characters provides lots of story opportunities that occasionally becomes a bit too implausible and soapy, but never fails to entertain.",1250899200,,962,5.5479452054794525

Racism comes face to face with Dr. Greene in ""Tribes"", and he gets beat up bad in a later episode.

2167429,5,B00064MW74,"Wow.  ""ER"" just rolled along from season to season with amazing storylines and superbly compelling drama, didn't it?  Season Three is no exception.  It lives up to the standard set by the first two seasons splendidly, and it without a doubt worth picking up on DVD (not until after buying seasons one and two, of course).  Each character also gets plenty of memorable storylines, including:

Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards): What an interesting season for Mark this is!  Although a glorious character, Mark makes some very controversial decisions in this season, including invading the privacy of Boulet by sneaking into her private files.  Also, Mark suffers a brutal beating in the hospital men's room and ends up pretty screwed up by the incident, eventually buying a gun in an act of insane paranoia.

Doug Ross (George Clooney): Ross gets stuff to do in this season, but not quite as much as in the previous two.  Clooney was quite busy filming the disastrous ""Batman and Robin"" during season three to get a whole lot of really good storylines, but he does get some, including an excellent continuing storyline with Kristen Dunst as a problematic teenage girl.

Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield): Yes, this is the season that the beloved Dr. Lewis tragically leaves the show, but the good news is that she gets plenty of good episodes before doing that.  Her and Mark come very close to being lovers when she unexpectantly invites him on a Hawaiian trip with her.  Mark ends up falling deeply in love with her, but when she announces her plans to move to Phoenix and be with her sister Chloe, he's torn between telling her his love and letting her enjoy her new life.  Sherry Stringfield will be back in 2001, but as I said in my reviews of seasons one and two, she just never was the same when she came back, so this is the last season where we can really embrace her wonderul, beautiful character.

John Carter (Noah Wyle): Carter goes through a significant romantic relationship with Abby Keaton, played by an excellent Glenne Headly, but the relationship comes to an end when she moves away.  Carter also embraces a new career as a hospital resident, when he realizes that surgery just isn't for him.  An exciting year for Carter, definately!

Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies): Wow, what a year for Carol!  Carol accidentally kills a patient by giving him the wrong blood, and when she chooses to fess up to her mistake, the hospital suffers a humiliation in a local paper and she is fired.  Fortunately, she gets her job back after an exciting day in a convenience store in ""The Long Way Around,"" perhaps the season's most exciting episodes and one of the best episodes of the show.  This unique episode spends 3/4 of its time outside of the hospital, and has an excellent performance from guest star Ewan McGregor and of course Julianna Margulies.

Jeannie Boulet (Gloria Reuben): Boulet gets another excellent year, even better than her previous season.  She is diagnosed with AIDS in the season premiere and spends the whole season dealing with problems with hospital policy related to her condition, and eventually gets in some major trouble when Mark finds out she has HIV.  Eventually she admits it to the whole hospital, and also deals with problems with ex-husband Al.  You got to love Boulet, and Gloria Reuben's gentle acting makes her such a loveable character.

Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes): Weaver was a very significant guest star in season two, and gets to join the rest of the cast in the main credits this season.  This is a good year for her character, especially for those who pigeonhole her as the bitch of the hospital.  She shows real sympathy with Boulet's HIV problem.  She also helps encourage Carter to pursue the career he wants near the end of the season.

Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle): Benton gets an excellent year here, when his girlfriend (barely a girlfriend, really) gets pregnant with his child.  The baby is born prematurely near the end of the season and Benton deals with other hardships throughout the year, especially when he learns he may be responsible for the suicide (?) of a resident near the middle of the season.  Great acting from Eriq La Salle!

So, there you have it.  Season three is full of memorable acting and great scenarios for all characters involved.  ""ER"" was the tip top in the ratings at this time, and it's no wonder why.

The DVD set follows the style of the previous two, mostly.  The packaging changes very much.  The group shot of the ER staff is changed to little square panels with a large photograph at the bottom, and the four double sides disks are now changed to six single sided disks.  The content inside is excellent, as usual, with incredible transfers (looks just like a movie) in anamorphic 16:9 widescreen.  Excellent quality that enhances the amazingly cinematic feel of ""ER.""

What are you waiting for?  The only reason to put off buying this season is if you haven't bought the first two, and if you've bought those and love them as much as I do, you can NOT turn down the incredible season three!  Highly recommended!  Order it now!",1140134400,5,5123,4.754246885617214

Why is it that they are now playing season 11 or 12, can't remember which one, but we can only buy up to Season 3. Also why is it that a TV show which is made in, set in, and first shown in the US can't get on DVD before the UK. Amazon.co.uk are already selling Season 4, which was released to them in MAY!!!!. Another prime example is Friends. When I was trying to buy season 4 from amazon.com, the UK were already starting to sell the 1st half of season 10 (the second half was only just being shown for the first time - yes they had season 10 before it had even finished airing)I am aware that this is to no fault of Amazon but to the networks themselves. It is so frustrating, because by the time they actually get on and produce them, half of us will be in our 40's/50s and won't be bothered with it anymore and there go the sales.

2167444,5,B00064MW74,"Nominated for 25 Golden Globes and 110 Emmys, including 7 for Outstanding Drama Series, ER has long been one of the best prime-time shows on television. Premiering in September 1994 on NBC, the hour-long hospital drama vividly illustrates the intensity and fast-paced stress endemic to hospital emergency rooms across America. Brought into being by Michael Crichton - famous Hollywood insider, novelist, and brains behind such films as Jurassic Park, Twister, and Timeline - ER fulfills its creator's ultimate vision (it took over a decade of pitching the show before network executives bit) for a close-to-life glimpse of the technology and the humanity omnipresent in the ER. Since its inception, many cast members have passed through the halls of ER, many of them having gone on to become big stars in Hollywood...

ER follows the exploits of a group of emergency room staff who work in a busy Chicago hospital. The show attempts to examine every detail of the ER experience. From the exhilaration of saving a life to the tedium caused by mountains of paperwork, all the highs and lows are covered. In the show's first year, a number of regular faces staffed the ER. Doctors Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle), Douglas Ross (George Clooney), and Susan Lewis (Sherri Stringfield) were regulars in the ER along with Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) and Benton's medical student understudy (and later ER doctor), John Carter (Noah Wyle)... Any given episode tends to run multiple plot lines throughout the show, interweaving scenes in short snippets intended to heighten audience emotion and create the aura of a stress-laden atmosphere. The show's high drama, coupled with subplots of the staffers' personal lives and the display of cutting edge medical technology, combine to make ER one of most adrenaline-inducing programs in television history...

The ER (Season 3) DVD features a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere ""Dr. Carter, I Presume"" in which Carter begins his internship at the ER with a difficult day filling in for Peter as the ER surgery consultant. Meanwhile, several plotlines related to the staffers' personal lives take twists when Carol runs into Shep and his new girlfriend and Peter runs into an old friend at a barbecue... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""No Brain, No Gain"" in which Peter fights to save the life of a gang member already declared dead by Doug, and ""The Long Way Around"" in which Carol is held hostage during a robbery at a local store...

Below is a list of episodes included on the ER (Season 3) DVD:

Episode 49 (Dr. Carter, I Presume)

Episode 50 (Let the Games Begin)

Episode 51 (Don't Ask, Don't Tell)

2167445,5,B00064MW74,"Since it's beginning in September of 1994, ER has been my favorite television shows. The great story lines and great characters that have appeared on this show have occupied my Thursday nights for 11 years.

While I still enjoy the show now, the prime of the show, at least to me, was in the beginning. With Anthony Edwards, George Clooney and Sherry Stringfield, plus Noah Wyle, Julianna Margulies and Eriq LaSalle, the early years were some of the best television hours ever.

Season three was one that saw a number of changes to the ER. Dr. Susan Lewis (Stringfield) left the ER for Phoenix. She returned a number of years later and is still part of the show, but her departure left a hole in the staff, not to mention, in the heart of fellow doc Mark Greene (Edwards). This season also saw the edition of Laura Innes to the regular cast. She appeared in season two as a recurring character and was added to the cast to start season three. Her character of Dr. Weaver has experienced some of the greatest changes of anyone since her arrival on the show.

Some of the key storylines early in this season involve Greene and Lewis, as there is an obvious romantic connection between the two, that leaves Greene feeling betrayed when she leaves.  A highlight episode of the season was ""Fear of Flying"" where the two docs take a medivac chopper to a remote accident scene and save a family of four. Greene, who is one of my all time favorite television characters, also experiences a brutal attack in the restroom of the hospital and has a hard time readjusting as he returns to work.

Dr. Doug Ross (Clooney) begins the season as he ended the second, still moving from woman to woman, but when a woman whom he barely knows passes out at his apartment and eventually dies at County, he begins to change his ways, mainly pointing his affection in the direction of nurse Carol Hathaway (Margulies), who is also one of his exes. Clooney's work with a homeless teen, portrayed excellently by Kirsten Dunst, is one of the great story arcs throughout the season.

As for Hathaway, she takes the medical school tests, and does incredibly well, but realizes that she likes being a nurse. As nurse manager, she takes on the administration with some solid results and also gets a highlight episode where she is caught in an armed robbery at a convenience store. It is in this episode that you see the true Carol Hathaway and her compassion for others. Ewan McGregor also does a great guest stint as one of the robbers.

Dr. John Carter (Wyle) looks so young, especially as I finished this past season watching him leave the show after 11 seasons. Carter has an affair with his superior, and also sees the death of one of his fellow surgical interns (guest star Omar Epps). He also begins to realize that he may have chosen the wrong elective, as he sees that his healing ways may be better suited for the ER, not the surgical unit.

Dr. Peter Benton (La Salle) is probably one of the best surgeons on the staff, but it is his people skills that make his turn in pediatrics a tough one. The death of intern Gant weighs heavily on Benton, but it is the birth of his son as the season comes to a close that really begins to change his ways. The Benton as father story line served the show well for a number of years until his eventual departure.

Weaver (Innes) is in almost constant combat with Greene. She has ideas that she tries to implement that just don't sit well with the senior doc. Her kissing up to the bosses irks not only Greene, but a number of other staff members. She was not a likeable character for a long time, but that has changed over the last few years.

The one ER character that I never really cared for was PA Jeannie Boulet (Gloria Reuben). This season featured a lot of stories for her, as she battled her HIV status and considered relationships before reconciling with her ex. This character, although Reuben is a good actor, always seemed to be concerned with herself and nobody else and that always bothered me.

Additionally, this season saw some great guest and recurring stars. As mentioned, Dunst and Epps were key figures for many episodes, while William H. Macy and John Aylward continued there positions as hospital staffers. Jorja Fox came on board as Dr. Maggie Doyle and Veronica Cartwright won praise for her guest turn as the mother of a sick young man. Glenne Healy, cch Pounder, Kevin Tighe, Sam Anderson and Jamie Gertz were just a few of the many who had a presence in the ER. Maria Bello guest starred at the end of the season and was added to the staff in the next year.

There are two great commentary tracks, as well as two very good documentaries. One involves the Fear of Flying episode while the other deals with the support staff at the hospital, the nurses, desk clerks, etc. Both are very informative. There are also a great gag reel and some deleted scenes.

Of course I am biased, as this is my favorite show, but I don't think you could find a finer group of actors and better story lines than this season of ER provided.",1118534400,53,5065,4.5163755458515285
2167446,5,B00064MW74,"If only the writers of the current ER would take a look back at the early seasons...the show is a shadow of its former self: wooden, formulaic plots, no conflict resolution, and few compelling characters.  Season three is a prime example of pitch-perfect television.  The writing is quick, the plots are entwined, intriguing and engaging, and the acting is top-notch.  If you watch closely, you'll see that the interplay of the cast is what makes the early seasons work so well.  People talking at the same time, introducing a spontaneous gesture or a laugh that brings a great deal of humanity to the entire show, and you actually LIKE them!  Season three is great television.  No complaints whatsoever.  I'll keep buying ER through season 8 or 9.",1118102400,2,748,4.84251968503937
2167447,5,B00064MW74,"I am so pleased to see Season Three of what has become one of the most respected and influential television programs.  I am also pleased that episodes are released on a one-sided as opposed to two-sided discs.

Here's hoping we will see the DVD release of such popular medical shows as St. Elsewhere, Medical Center, Marcus Welby, M.D., Dr. Kildare, and Ben Casey, without which, there would certainly not have been an ER.",1116288000,,422,4.767123287671233
2167448,5,B00064MW74,It's ben a while but ER the complete third season is finally out!  The day it came out I went straight from school to the store to pick it up.  I went through the season in about three days....and wow...I am counting down the days until season 4. Although it was a great season there are some weak points and even a cast member leaves but I won't spoil it.  The six disc set makes it easier to use although you find yourself pulling out a new disc every so often.  Overall I give it five stars and with the great price it was worth the wait.....enjoy.,1115078400,,551,4.121495327102804
2167449,5,B00064MW74,"I have seasons One and Two and I think season Three is a better layout overall. I don't mind that Seasons 1 & 2 are double sided discs, what bothered me about them is they are not labled so you wouldn't know which side you are putting into the DVD player. However, season three is nothing like that. It's easier to deal with. Now I cannot wait until season 4 and I hope they keep the same layout and design.",1114732800,3,407,4.1
2167450,5,B00064MW74,"For those that are interested, Season 4 will be out in May in the UK. For some reason the UK releases, which were about 3 months behind the US for seasons 1 and 2, are now storming ahead with the next releases. Perhaps you guys in the US are more patient than us??!",1113868800,2,265,4.018867924528302
2167451,5,B00064MW74,"Seasons 1-8 can be found with some difficulty in Japan. They can be quite expensive! While the DVDs were created for the Japanese market, they can be played with the original English soundtrack if you have a DVD player that will play DVDs for that region (or software which will ""liberate"" the DVD.)

Don't ask me why they don't release them here first because I just don't know. Surely the demand is here.

The eBay DVDs appear to be knockoffs of the Japanese DVDs with the exception of season 4 -- where the bootleggers seem to have screwed up when they were making the copies. Caveat emptor.",1113177600,2,594,4.542056074766355
2167452,5,B00064MW74,"AH! YES! finally! the third season of ER on DVD! i own seasons one and two, and have been longing for this season to come out. I'm counting down the days and can hardly stand it! I have no idea what to expect though, because I'm the kind of person that if i miss one episode in a season of a tv show, i go completely bizzerk! so i just buy them on dvd, and i hope this isn't a let down! cause i know the 1st and 2nd seasons havent!!!",1111622400,2,433,3.769230769230769
