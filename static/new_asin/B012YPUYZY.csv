8726728,5,B012YPUYZY,"This particular Christmas compilation is a 4-disc DVD set of the recent Remastered Deluxe Editions of 4 Rankin/Bass Christmas classics, owned by the WB; 'Twas the Night Before Christmas in 1974, Frosty's Winter Wonderland in 1976, Jack Frost in 1979 (never on authorized DVDs before 2008), and the piece de resistance, The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow in 1975 (never on DVD at all before 2012)! Each and every one of these DVDs contain bonus programs, but not extra specials; each of the 4 specials to its own DVD. If you don't already have these classics on DVD, this 4-disc set's a great idea to save money and shelf space. If only the DVD case wasn't a stackable one; consult Amazon or ebay for empty 4-disc DVD cases that don't stack the discs on top of each other! DVDs or any other discs like that, can get scratched up real easy stacked in a single notch. By the way, people of all ages have enjoyed all 4 of these classics for generations, not just children; so don't let the case's labeling at the top front cover fool you! Merry Christmas in July, everybody!",1500940800,4,1094,4.558375634517766
