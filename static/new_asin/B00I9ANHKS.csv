My Review:

 My children have enjoyed Word World ever since it was created and released, so I jumped at the chance to let my soon to be 4 year old watch this DVD, that is the latest for the beloved series. A series that my children first viewed on the PBS channel which is still viewed today. It is a great children's animated series that teaches children about letters, sounds, words, and word/sentence building. There are four different episodes on the Hide and Seek DVD, they are:

Hide and Seek

J-J Jelly

The Really Red Ruby

Bed Bugs

 Hide and Seek is all about building words that end in ""ake"". Words such as cake, rake, etc. One of the characters runs into a problem building a word to add to the already growing list. My son loves to watch the interaction of the animal characters. I as a parent feel good letting him watch Word World because it's educational and I don't have to worry about what is viewed. Its a fun and entertaining way to learn phonics.

 It's running time is 60 minutes and was released 5/13/2014. The suggested retail price is $6.99 and is available at amazon at this link. My sponsor has offered to give away a DVD of Word World Hide and Seek to one lucky reader, please enter below.

8640035,4,B00I9ANHKS,"I watched Word World's Hide and Seek with my son who is almost four. I like educational shows that help my children learn. Hide and Seek was a great example of an educational show. I also liked how everything was made out of words such as the barn, school, animals, etc. Very clever!

The word friends were sweet, helpful and kind to one another. They had great attitudes even when things didn't turn out the way they had planned. The characters also used their imagination and their brain to figure out a plan.

I had my eye on my son a few times during the show to see his response. He was tuned in the entire time. He laughed, smiled and showed interest. I knew he was learning how to put letters together to form words.

Overall, the show was uplifting and positive.  I loved the quote at the end, ""A pretend adventure can be the best adventure.""",1400025600,,850,4.360759493670886
