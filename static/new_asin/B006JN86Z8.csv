4993772,2,B006JN86Z8,"In the set I bought, the episode ""Monster from Another Planet"" on Season 2, Disc 2, is incomplete. When Tennessee & Chumley decide to see Mr. Whoopee, the screen goes black for a commercial break and the episode just ends without showing the conclusion. The timer on my DVD Player has the episode listed as being over 5 minutes instead of over 9 minutes like the other cartoons. Does anyone else have this problem, or do I just have a defective set?",1331596800,3,449,4.487804878048781
4993773,1,B006JN86Z8,"I begged Mark Arnold and Shout! that they not use DNR/DVNR way back when Underdog was first announced. It nearly destroyed the Underdog set and has succeeded in Killing Tennesse and Chumly!  Heavy handed  DNR/DVNR was used on this set and the effects are crap. I've never seen a case where it made anything look better regardless of issues that exist on the source material. DVNR has nearly ruined this set. Very disappointing!

The folks at Shout! should talk to Dennis Rood's [the master!] crew at image who did Twilight Zone DVD and Blu-Ray for they are true professionals who do some of the industry's best mastering/transfer to digital work.

1 Star - Why did they drown this in DNR/DVNR which is never needed and never makes anything truly look better. Why wasn't the original theme audio used it was present as an extra so if does exist. I don't min lower quality if that's all that exists what I do mind is revisionism and DNR/DVNR to try to make something look modern when it isn't.
Given those involved I had high hopes for this set which were crushed by the result. Unlike Tennessee this set from Shout! has failed. All involved should be ashamed of themselves!

To quote Michelle S.
""Visually, the cartoons are quite colorful. However, each and every cartoon on this set (and the Underdog set too) suffers from very heavy-handed use of DVNR (digital video noise reduction).
(For those who don't know what DVNR is, it's a process companies use to remove film grain when they ""restore"" old footage. (For some reason, producers must think that film grain is inherently ""bad"".))

The problem when DVNR is overused - like it was here - details and lines (especially black lines on a white background) are often obliterated. When shots are over-processed, small things (like Chumley's whiskers, or the lines that make up Tennessee's eyes) are nearly processed away, and occasionally entire shots are ruined. (Towards the end of ""Tell-Tale Telegraph"" all that's left of the black telegraph wires is a series of jagged broken lines.)""

Edit: For those who are thumb's downing this review have you really looked at the picture on this set. If you are somehow actually happy with the result then congrats I'm sure Mr MacMillan will be glad to churn out more of the same cheap shoddy amateurish transfers/masterings.",1331510400,18,2317,4.835858585858586
4993774,3,B006JN86Z8,"Growing up, I enjoyed Tennessee Tuxedo quite a bit.  I loved when Tennessee and Chumley would visit Mr. Whoopee as I knew I'd learn something interesting as well.

So, when this DVD set was announced, I immediately pre-ordered it.

This set gives you all 70 episodes of Tennessee Tuxedo, as well as some episodes of The King and Odie, Tooter Turtle, Klondike Kat, and The Hunter.

For most fans, this is all you need to know.  But for those interested in the minute details that Amazon's blurbs tend to overlook, please read on.

While I would say this is likely the most thorough collection of Tennessee Tuxedo that we'll likely get, there are a number of issues that keep it from being the truly definitive collection fans had long hoped for.

The most obvious change that fans will notice immediately is the theme song that the first episode kicks off to is *not* the original recording - even though the visuals are correct.

The original theme features the voices of Tennessee and Chumley, as well as a chorus of male singers.  The theme that starts more than half of the episodes here sounds like one taken from a children's record, with a female singer, *no* Tennessee & Chumley vocals, and no sound effects to go with the visuals (sound effects the original opening had).

Thankfully, the original audio *can* be heard as part of a collection of bumpers, promos, etc. that is on disc three.  (This collection of various odd and ends is sourced from bootleg video tapes, so the quality ranges from mediocre to quite poor.) (Personally, I think it would have been nice if the producers of this set had added the original soundtrack audio to the clean visuals and used that to open each episode instead of the non-original theme, which gets old really fast...)

The alternate opening sequence (used on about half of the episodes) seems to have its original audio intact, but the visuals include an on-screen ""bug"" in the upper left corner.  (A ""bug-less"" version of this alternate opening is on the aforementioned collection of bumpers/promos, but from a video source.)

The closing credits sequence uses the kiddie-record audio (with the female singer), but the original-audio version (an instrumental) is part of the promo/bumpers collection.

As for the episodes themselves, most seem to be taken from the original film masters, but one short (""Helecopter Hi-Jinx"") was definitely sourced from video.

Twelve of the seventy Tennessee Tuxedo episodes are missing their original title cards.

Visually, the cartoons are quite colorful.  However, each and every cartoon on this set (and the Underdog set too) suffers from very heavy-handed use of DVNR (digital video noise reduction).
(For those who don't know what DVNR is, it's a process companies use to remove film grain when they ""restore"" old footage.  (For some reason, producers must think that film grain is inherently ""bad"".))

The problem when DVNR is overused - like it was here - details and lines (especially black lines on a white background) are often obliterated.  When shots are over-processed, small things (like Chumley's whiskers, or the lines that make up Tennessee's eyes) are nearly processed away, and occasionally entire shots are ruined.  (Towards the end of ""Tell-Tale Telegraph"" all that's left of the black telegraph wires is a series of jagged broken lines.)

In addition to the 70 Tennessee Tuxedo cartoons, this set also includes 11 Tooter Turtle episodes, 38 shorts featuring The King and Odie, 35 episodes of The Hunter, and 5 Klondike Kat cartoons.  (The supporting cartoons seem to have all been mastered from film, but their openings are all mastered from bootleg videos (except Tooter Turtle's, although his closing segment was sourced from video.)

As with the Underdog set, there are a number of oversights and lapses in quality control that might be minor on the surface, but ones that make you wonder if the producers of this collection really did all they could to make it the best presentation possible.

The biggest oversight is the fact that a whopping *five* cartoons listed on the cases and in the booklet are not included.

In each case, a disclaimer pops up on the DVD telling us that the affected cartoon's audio could not be found after the packaging had already been printed.  (For some reason, a sixth disclaimer also tells up about an *unlisted* cartoon being AWOL as well...)

In some instances, the affected cartoon was replaced with an alternate title, but mostly this was not the case.  (Here's the list: (disc 1) ""Big Birthday Blast"" [The Hunter] (replaced with ""Raquet Racket""); (disc 2) ""Bye Bye Bees"" [The King & Odie] (replaced with ""Nose For The Noose"");  (disc 3) ""Record Rocket [The Hunter] (no substitution); (disc 5) ""The Unteachables"" [Tooter Turtle] (no substitution); (disc 6) ""Lincoln Tunnel Caper"" [The Hunter] (no substitution); (disc 6) a disclaimer for ""Grand Canyon Caper"" [The Hunter] not being included pops up, but this wasn't listed in the first place (no substitution).)

Lapses in quality control can also be seen with *many* titles being misspelled on the cases and in the booklet, and a few being totally misidentified.  (For example, ""Teddy Bear Trouble"" was identified as ""Koala Caper"" in the booklet and on the DVD case.)

The bottom line is that if you want every episode of Tennessee Tuxedo, this is the set that you would have to get.

But, the non-original theme song, overuse of DVNR, AWOL episodes, and lapses in quality control keep it from being the absolute superlative collection fans had long hoped for.

(For those people who also buy the Underdog DVD set, here's a tally of the TTV cartoons you'll get when combined with this one:
Tennessee Tuxedo - all 70 episodes (TT set); Underdog - all 124 episodes (UD set); Go Go Gophers - all 48 episodes (UD set); Commander McBragg - all 48 episodes (UD set); Tooter Turtle - 23 of 39 episodes (12 episodes on UD set, 11 episodes on TT set); The King and Odie - 38 of 104 episodes (TT set); The Hunter - 35 of 65 episodes (35 episodes on TT set (the UD set has two episodes, but both are also on the TT set); Klondike Kat - 19 of 26 episodes (14 on UD set, 5 on TT set)",1331251200,175,6169,4.830798479087452
4993775,4,B006JN86Z8,"My first viewing of these cartoons were when it was already in syndication as part of The Underdog Show on Nickelodeon in the 90's, and later on Cartoon Network and Boomerang.  I had watched every episode of Underdog several times over, and I originally thought I had seen all of the episodes of Tennessee Tuxedo.  Little did I know that there were only about 25 or so episodes that were shown with Underdog, while there were actually 70 created in total!  I had special VHS episodes of Tennessee here and there that had extra episodes not shown in syndication, but even those only got the episode count up to 30 to 35.  I searched and searched for years for other episodes on the internet to no avail.  The actual Tennessee Tuxedo show seems to have rarely been shown in its original form in years, and these other 30 or so episodes seemed lost to me.

Needless to say, I preordered both this DVD set and the Underdog set, distributed by Shout Factory.  I have yet to watch the entire set, but i've already spent the last several hours watching these ""lost' episodes today.  Everything here is of exceptional quality.  Unlike previous DVD releases, these episodes come with the original theme songs and original title cards.  this set also includes several episodes of other TTV creations such as Tooter Turtle and the King Leonardo and Odie, which are two other hard-to-find cartoons....especially the latter.

As far as the cartoon itself, for those that don't know, it's about an anthropomorphic penguin and walrus that live in a Zoo, and get into all sorts of hijinx, usually in the course of trying to better their own lives but with questionable results.  In every episode, they seek advice about a topic from the man with all the answers, Mr. Whoopie!  This is where the cartoon takes the time to actually teach the viewer about a topic.  Such topics covered are how the human heart works, the solar system, metabolism and exercise, how honey is made, how to build a house, etc.  It's a very fun way to learn while watching an entertaining cartoon.  Granted, many of these episodes are outdated when they talk about technology since this is a rather old series, but it's still educational.

For fans of the series from years ago, pick this set up!  I can almost guarantee that even if you have watched these in syndication in the last few years, that over half the episodes on here are ones that you haven't seen before, or haven't seen in decades!  For newcomers, this show will be entertaining for both adults and kids alike, and kids will actually be learning as they watch.  Many times, sets like these do not have very long print runs, so pick this up ASAP as this amazing price on Amazon, and while you are at it, go and pick up the Underdog Complete collection as well!  It's the same great quality as this set : )

I still have yet to go through the other cartoons aside from Tennessee Tuxedo in their entirety, but I would read through Michelle's review above for some of the negatives on this set.  I didn't sit down and write out the flaws like that person did, but I can definitely confirm some of what was mentioned.  I'm rather surprised so many typos and mistakes got through QA.  Personally, I only bought this set for Tennessee, and I only remember one episode (I believe it was Helicopter Hijinx but I'm not positive) being of what appeared to be VHS quality, which surprised me because the episode that it was is not even a rare episode.  Surprisingly though, all of the rare episodes are DVD quality.  Due to the fact that this appears to have been a rushed product, I have to rate this down to 4 stars.  Overall though, as far as the quality of the main show it's featuring, I think they did a better job on this one than the Underdog set.  This set is very well worth picking up.  I sincerely doubt you will be able to find most of these episodes out there from a source even half as good.",1331078400,18,3936,4.526166902404526
4993776,5,B006JN86Z8,"I've pre-ordered Tennessee Tuxedo and Underdog.  I'm just curious if TT will include The King & Odie, Tooter Turtle and The Hunter or is it all TT?

Update:  I've beeen told that this is Tennessee Tuxedo only.  Hopefully that means that The King & Odie (along with The Hunter & Tooter Turtle) will get its own box set.",1323820800,7,318,4.431034482758621
4993777,5,B006JN86Z8,"Before ""March of the Penguins"", there was Tennessee and Chummily. I remember watching Underdog on Nickelodeon about 20 years ago and Tennessee was always my favorite. (Apparently though, the Tennessee series originally aired apart from Underdog) so now we have this new stand-alone set!

4993801,3,B006JN86Z8,"I bought this set mainly for the King and Odie cartoons. The problem is these are two part stories, and for the majority, there is only either the first or the second part, not both. I was hoping that on the disc featuring the King Leonardo cartoons they would feature the show's opening and closing theme. They have the opening theme, but it is buried on another disc's extras with the Tennessee Tuxedo bumpers. It's amazing how bad the artwork got as the show reached the end. Biggie and Itchy look like they were drawn by grade-schoolers, and everything else is out of whack.",1490572800,,578,4.5673076923076925

4993807,5,B006JN86Z8,"I am really enjoying this collection. I had never seen  the King Leonardo cartoons that share the disks with Tennessee and Chumly. Leonardo's nemesis Mr. Mad is oddly reminiscent of the  old man version of Dracula played by Gary Oldham in the 1991 film by Martin Scorsese. I found this pretty funny, and wondered if they had used the cartoon Mr. Mad as a model for Mr. Oldham's character costume. Apologies for any name spelling errors.",1464739200,,436,4.723684210526316
4993818,4,B006JN86Z8,"While I was happy with the dvd set and most of the extras, I was dissappointed with The King and Odie segments.

4993820,3,B006JN86Z8,"If you are looking for only Tennessee Tuxedo cartoons, without the shorts that should be included, then you will like this set.  I have to wonder how many times they will release them like this though, as several years ago they released a different set but only with a few of the Tennessee Tuxedo cartoons on them.  This set seems to include more.  I don't understand why they just can't be released as they were originally aired, with the shorts included, as I liked watching them with all of the parts included.  Another thing that disappoints me is that the beginning and ending credits are cut and are not complete, and some of the music is dubbed over from the original.  Why?  There are also episodes of the King & Odie and the Hunter at the end of each disc, so I guess that's a bonus to be able to see these even though that's all that they are, they are just by themselves.  A couple of the intro clips in the Hunter and King & Odie are bad quality as if they were taken from VHS, but the episodes themselves are really good quality so that is a plus.  Overall, I'm happy to be able to see these cartoons, even though I'm disappointed they are not the complete episodes as originally aired on TV.  I'm wondering if they will again release them yet again in a different format, so I'm cautious about purchasing this set but it's the best we have for now.",1456358400,,1362,4.330708661417323

4993869,5,B006JN86Z8,"When I was growing up, they showed this cartoon at noon instead of Saturday morning (unfortunately).  It was a Tennessee Tuxedo segment and then Commander McBragg, Tooter The Turtles, and others, but it was the penguin and walrus that I loved by far.  I've seen it in recent times, and though some of the science illustrated is dated, as a show I love it as much as an adult as when I was little.

So what was so great about the cartoon?  Tennessee Tuxedo was an ambitious penguin, wanting to get out of the zoo and into the human world, and if he couldn't do that, he could always establish his status among his fellow zoo residents.  There were also his visits to Mr. Whoopee whenever he had some problem, yet the cartoon avoided turning into a morality play.  Just because he learns the scientific or other lessons from Mr. Whoopee doesn't mean Tennessee's problems are automatically solved because of it.

Somewhat old-fashioned (the cartoon dates from the mid 1960's), but still funny and informative to this day.",1407456000,,1018,4.685393258426966

4993902,5,B006JN86Z8,"This six disc set contains all the 70 episodes of this great show.

It is about a penguin - Tennessee Tuxedo (Don Addams), Chumley a walrus (Bradley Bolke), Phineas J. Whoope (Larry Storch) with his 3-D blackboard (three-dimensional), Stanley Livington the zookeeper (Mort Marshall) and his assistant Flunky (Kenny Delmar).

Stanley found Tennessee and Chumley at the South Pole, wishing they were some place hot, and so as the story goes, they ended up at the Megalopolis Zoo, where they are always trying to escape.

Every one of his projects are done half-hearted and gets him into all manner of trouble. Mr. Whoope is there to give him knowledge of all kind, but Tennessee is in a hurry and only get half of the knowledge needed to succeed. He also tries to improve life at the zoo by scheming behind Stanley's back which ends with disastrous consequences.

There are also 20 of the 104 episodes of ""The King and Odie"" (King Leonardo and Odie Cologne), 20 episodes of ""The Hunter"", 5 episodes of ""Klondike Kat"" and 12 episodes of ""Tooter Turtle"". Also there is a special feature ""Tennessee Tuxedo Never Fails"", and a booklet on the history of these shows with an episode guide for the discs.

This is an amazing collection of animated cartoons as I have only seen Tennessee Tuxedo and The King when I was a kid, and relished the chance to see them again.

I gave this set five stars as it is a great collection of very old cartoons, that in my opinion, are still as good today as they were back then, and I recommend it to anyone who appreciate good cartoons of an age gone bye.",1368230400,3,1582,4.572438162544169
4993903,5,B006JN86Z8,we're just happy Shout Factory put all of the shorts with Tennessee Tuxedo in them on DVD.  Don Adams is in his first successful TV role as he was a standup comic before this.  enjoyed the educational value where the good guys learn from Mr. Whoopee and his animated chalkboard.  he does drive that zookeeper nuts to some degree i must say but it has more educational value on it than like 99% of TV.,1367193600,,400,4.306666666666667

I'd recommend to the young at heart.",1365811200,,183,4.228571428571429

4993908,4,B006JN86Z8,"I bought this for my kids, because I remember liking it as a kid - and who doesn't love Don Adams!  My 6 year old daughter likes it, and gets interested in the tutorial sessions to learn how things work.  Some of the ""technology"" is obviously dated, but she likes watching with us because she has more questions.  I expect the interest will last a few years, and she will revisit these shows as she learns more about ""stuff"" and it makes more sense.",1358121600,,449,4.321428571428571
4993909,5,B006JN86Z8,"Excellent set to include all the Tennessee Tuxedo shorts.  Nice commontaries on some fo the episodes.  The quality on most of this set is very good, there are some places where they just didn't have a good master to work with.  The set also includes King Ode and episodes of The Hunter.  Only bad thing I found was that they were missing many of the King Ode Episodes and since the plots were always spread over two shorts, you miss out on some story lines.  Still I would recommend this.",1357948800,,488,4.377777777777778
4993910,5,B006JN86Z8,"I am giving this set 5 stars for the effort that was put into restoring and preserving this timeless classic television series but there were a couple of flaws that they should have corrected before releasing this set.

As other reviewers have noted, this series is about as complete as it's going to be.  All the original background music for each cartoon is intact which is extremely important when releasing any classic TV show.

This set includes most of, if not all of the Tennessee Tuxedo, The King and Odie, The Hunter, a few Tooter the Turtle and Klondike Kat Cartoons.  The remaining Tooter the Turtle and Klondike Kat cartoons are on the Underdog DVD set, which was released recently.

All the cartoons on this set are broken up individually, rather than being shown as a 30 minute program such as with Underdog or Rocky and Bullwinkle.  I am not completely sure why Shout Factory chose to break up the cartoons individually but it's pretty safe to say that there were some missing elements of the series that are now gone forever.  The DVD set includes many of the 30 second Tennessee Tuxedo riddles but they are all in Mr. Whoopie's office.  There are no cartoons of the three Tuxedo characters telling a riddle as they going up in the rocket.  This set also include the original beginning and ending titles for Tennessee Tuxedo, King and Odie and The Hunter.  However the original titles and Tuxedo riddles are on the disc as bonus material.

There is a note that appears at the beginning of the DVD that says the picture quality may change from episode to episode because some elements were missing and that they have had to use they only available source.  The ""only available source"" looks like it came from a second or third generation VHS copy.  Most of the cartoons, however, are in excellent picture and sound quality.  I noted only one Tuxedo cartoon that had degraded picture quality.  The remaining elements with degraded picture quality are the before and after titles for the other cartoons such as The King and Odie, The Hunter, Klondike Kat and the end title for Tooter the Turtle.

Here is the only flaw with this set:  It was discovered that one King and Odie cartoon was missing, after the packaging for this set went to the printers.  There is a message on one of the DVDs noting this and that they could not locate the audio for the missing cartoon.  Instead, they replaced it with an alternate cartoon.  The Missing King and Odie cartoon, ""Bye Bye Bees"" was actually the second part of the cartoon ""Honey Hungry"", which IS included on the DVD.  I was able to locate the missing cartoon, ""Bye Bye Bees"" on YouTube.  They also noted that they were not able to locate the Tooter the Turtle cartoon, ""The Unteachables"".  I found the cartoon, ""The Unteachables"" on YouTube as well.  I believe there was also a missing cartoon from The Hunter but don't remember the title.  The problem with the missing cartoons is that some of The Hunter and The King and Odie cartoons are similar to the Underdog or Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons in that they are in parts.  You need to see all the parts to find out how the story ends.  It probably would have been better to have removed all the cartoons with missing parts rather than include pieces of a particular story and leave viewers hanging.  Alternatively, they could have included these fragments as bonus material.

I bought this set to show to my children because I enjoyed these cartoons as a child back in the 70's and wanted my kids to enjoy them as well.  Despite the few flaws, I am still very pleased with this set and would highly recommend it to anyone who grew up with Tennessee Tuxedo.",1355529600,21,3669,4.617283950617284
