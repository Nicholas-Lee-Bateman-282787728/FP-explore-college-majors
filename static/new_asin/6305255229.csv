1004043,4,6305255229,I honestly think that was a darn good ppv except Mankind did not really say I Quit to The Rock. Other than that it was an okay ppv. I think the idea of having Vinnie Mac win the Royal Rumble was a cool idea. I reccomend this  video to any Hardcore WWF fan.

1004082,3,6305255229,"The 1999 Royal Rumble was suprisingly not that good as I expected. Here are the matches.

1. Road Dogg vs. Big Boss Man 6/10

Not a good way to start the pay-per-view. Not good because it did not have Hardcore Rules.

2. Ken Shamrock vs. Billy Gunn 7/10

A little better than the first but this match was still not satisfying.

3. X-Pac vs. Gangrel 8/10

First good match of the night. Very fast pace one too, but I did not like the ending. I wanted Gangrel to be the new European champ but that did not happen.

4. Sable vs. Luna (Strap Match) 5/10

The worst match of the night. It is a lttle pointless but it is not as terrible as some of the other reviewers say it is.

5. The Rock vs. Mankind (I Quit match) 10/10

The BEST match of the night. These two guys sacrificed everything (especially Mankind). It is a little too hardcore because Mankind was bleeding non-stop, Mankind was hit with a chair many many times, and Mankind almost got electricuted. I did not like the ending though. This match was crazy.

6. The Royal Rumble Match 8/10

Good match, but the ring was clear most of the match. I actually kind of liked the ending when Vince wins because it caught me by suprise, and I like getting surprised. That makes it predictable and then unpredictable. Some of the highlights were Mabel, Kane, and Stone Cold Steve Austin clearing the ring at least at one point in the match. Chyna (who was number 30) eliminated Mark Henry too!!",1106524800,7,1442,4.379699248120301
1004083,2,6305255229,"This PPV had some up's and downs but it was not forced down you throat.  The Royal Rumble match was awesome until somebody you don't expect to win does.

Mankind vs. The Rock for the World Title in an I Quit Match.  This was a good match but Foley had his hands tieed behind his back for a while.  Mankind never said ""I Quit"" but The Rock still won the match and the title. (4/5)

Ken Shamrock vs. Bad A$$ Billy Gunn for the IC Title.  This was a good match but at least it was clean.  Shamrock retains the title when Billy taps out to the Ankle Lock. (3/5)

Sable vs. Luna for the Women's Title in a Strap Match.  This match was utterly horrible.  The only reason it doesn't get a complete zero is because it was a strap match and they just whacked each other.  Sable retains the title. (0.5/5)

Big Boss Man vs. Road Dogg was stupid because it was not for the Hardcore Title.  It was not very pleasent.  Boss Man picks up the win. (1.5/5)

X-Pac vs. Gangrel for the European Title.  This match was good but it could have been so much better.  I thought Gangrel was gonna win but X-Pac somehow retains. (2.5/5)

Royal Rumble Match was so dumb.  Why in God's name do you have VINCE MCMAHON winning the Royal Rumble.  I don't care if Austin won again but why Vince?  This match was just bad. (2/5)

1004086,4,6305255229,"I have been a fan of the WWE for many years now, and I have seen a lot of Royal Rumble pay-per-views. The 1999 Royal Rumble was one of the better ones that I have seen. While the majority of the card featured nothing special, this Royal Rumble is worth owning for two outstanding matches. The first is obviously the Royal Rumble itself. Vince McMahon himself competed in the match. One thing I really liked about this video, was the fact that it shows Vince's different training regements. You see him lifting weights, drinking raw eggs, chasing after a live chicken, etc. It is some of the funniest stuff that you will ever see. The match itself was extremely well done, and I loved the ending. The second match is the ""I Quit"" match between The Rock and Mankind for the WWE title. This has to be one of my all time favorite matches. It is by far the most brutal WWE title match I have ever seen. Seeing Mic Foley take chair shot after chair shot to the head made me actually cringe. The thing that made it really brutal, was the fact that Mic's wife and children were sitting in the audience. They were actually brought to tears.
Overall, the 1999 Royal Rumble deserves a solid 4 stars. The pay-per-view as a whole is not very well rounded and you spend the whole time wanting to fast forward to the last two matches on the card. However, the match between The Rock and Mankind, and the Royal Rumble itself make the show an enjoyable one.",1078099200,2,1440,4.397003745318352

I think this match would've been much better if the Hardcore Championship (which was held by Road Dogg during this time) was defended in this match. Boss Man hits the Boss Man Slam for the win.

2.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Billy Gunn vs Ken Shamrock (c)

This match was set up after Billy Gunn mooned Shamrock's sister on an episode of Raw, which was a plan on Gunn's part to anger Shamrock enough to put his title on the line. Decently paced back and forth match with a few fair spots here and there. Shamrock injured Gunn's left ankle on an episode, so he works over the ankle for most of the match. Shamrock accidentally clotheslines the referee and with the ref being knocked out, Val Venis interferes and lays out Shamrock with a DDT. Gunn covers Shamrock but once the referee revives, Shamrock gets the shoulder up at 2 and the match goes on. Gunn attempts a dive off the top turnbuckle but misses and lands on the injured ankle. Shamrock takes advantage of the situation and locks in the Ankle Lock, causing Billy Gunn to tap out. Decent match from 2 underrated superstars from the Attitude Era

3.) WWF European Championship Match: Gangrel vs X-Pac (c)

This was a short bout and given the way the first 2 matches panned out, this was probably a good thing. A little bit of fast paced back and forth match that was pretty nice to sit through. There was a bit of a referee botch where Teddy Long counted the 3 count for Gangrel when X-Pac was down. Clearly it wasn't supposed to happen and the a few fans let him know about it as a short ""you f*cked up chant"" starts. X-Pac retains with a nicely executed mid-air X-Factor. A short but sweet match--minus the referee screw up.

4.) WWF Women's Championship Strap Match: Luna vs Sable (c)

Shane McMahon comes to the ring and introduces Luna as being the next Women's Champion. Footage is then shown of Luna attacking Sable's back on Heat with a backbreaker. Shane announces that Sable has a chronic back injury and requests Sable to come to the ring and relinquish her championship because of the injury. Sable comes to the ring but demands the bell to be rang to start the match. Short match and thankfully as well. Nothing special happened here. Just a bunch of Sable and Luna smacking each other around and trying to outbeat the other in touching the corner posts. As Shane sees Sable about to win, he distracts the referee to give Luna an advantage. However, Tori makes her PPV debut by jumping the barrier and hitting Luna before jumping back over the barrier. Sable touches the 4th turnbuckle and retains the title.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWF Championship I Quit Match: The Rock vs Mankind (c)

And this right here is the only thing that makes the 1999 Royal Rumble memorable. It's considered the greatest Royal Rumble match of all time and the greatest I Quit Match of all time as well. I'd have to agree with both. The build-up for this match was terrific. The Rock cut a pre-match backstage promo on Mankind guaranteeing to win the I Quit Match. This match was brutal and extremely violent! If you've seen Beyond The Mat, then you'll know that Foley's wife and little Noelle and Dewey Foley were in the crowd on this night as they bore witness to Foley's beating he took. There was The Rock knocking Mankind off a ledge and on to a circuit board that temporarily caused the lights in the arena to go out. After which, The Rock was visibly heard breaking character to ask Earl Hebner if Foley was alright. Moments later the match continues and heads back to the ring where Rock handcuffs Mankind, busts him open, and delivers those memorable 11 sickening steel chair shots to the head. When I first saw this as a kid, it was heartbreaking to see it but now when I watch it I have nothing but the utmost respect for Foley for putting his body through it all. After the 11 chair shots, Rock holds the microphone up to Foley where a recording of Foley saying ""I quit"" plays. Hebner thinks Foley really said I Quit, so he rings the bell and we have a new WWF Champion. Spectacular and truly a phenomenal match from both Rock and Mankind. One that no Attitude Era fan will ever forget

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) 1999 Royal Rumble Match

For the second year in a row, the Royal Rumble match was centered around Stone Cold Steve Austin (not that it was necessarily a bad thing); only this time Vince McMahon was involved. Their 1998 feud was recapped in a fantastic pre-match package video. This match was just the latest staple in their feud. McMahon declared that Austin would be entry #1 in the Royal Rumble and then put a $100,000 bounty price on Austin's head, stating that the superstar who could eliminate Austin would receive a $100,000 bonus to their paycheck. To further things, McMahon would make himself entry #30 until Commissioner Michaels overruled that and decided that Vince would be entry #2. In the opening minutes, Austin picks apart McMahon but is sideswiped by entry #3, Golga. McMahon makes a run for it through the crowd but Austin catches up with him. Austin chases McMahon through the stands and to a bathroom, which turns out to be a trap as The Corporation was awaiting Austin and laid the Smackdown on him in the bathroom, causing Austin to be taken to the hospital. The focus is this put on the Royal Rumble match which moves pretty slowly for the most part and wasn't great in terms of roster stars, as half of the superstars, excluding the main eventers and DX in this match either didn't matter or hadn't reached full superstardom yet. Excitement doesn't really pick up until later on when The Undertaker and The Ministry interfere in the Rumble and attacked and kidnapped Mabel who'd soon be sacrificed and re-christened as Viscera.

McMahon would return later and do commentary while watching the action. Austin would return shortly after, driving the ambulance and return to the match. Chyna would enter at #30, being the first female to ever enter the Royal Rumble match. The final 2 were back to Austin and McMahon as Austin had managed to fight off The Corporation. After beating Vince senseless for the most part, The Rock comes down and distracts Austin. The distraction allows Vince to throw Austin over the top rope to win the 1999 Royal Rumble. Everyone expected Austin to win the Rumble for the 3rd year in the row, but we were all swerved. The PPV goes off the air with Vince celebrating in the ring with Shane, Patterson, and Brisco.

Overall: Geez what a lousy PPV this was. I'd almost forgotten how bad it was until I had recently watched it. The Mankind vs Rock match was pretty much the only great thing about this PPV. All the other undercard matches weren't anything great and the Royal Rumble match was slow and quite boring. Vince McMahon winning the Rumble was a nice swerve but it really served no purpose when you consider that Austin ended up main eventing Wrestlemania that year anyway. It was very rare that crowds were ever quiet at shows back in the Attitude Era, but this was one event where they were quiet throughout the entire show and I don't blame them. Aside from the WWF Championship match, the other matches on the card were lackluster and the undercard matches really seemed out of place and lacked excitement and proper build to make them matter. Overall, this was one of the worst Royal Rumble PPVs to ever happen.",1421107200,,8655,5.1321022727272725
7886687,2,6305255229,"Royal Rumble 1999 is remembered for two reasons: The I quit match and McMahon winning the Rumble. These turn out to be the saving grace for an otherwise abysmal show.

(1) Road Dogg VS Boss Man. A boring and repetitive match with excessive brawling. The match is slow and feels like an eternity before we are finally put out of our misery. (2.5/10)

(2) Shamrock vs Gunn. This match drags on even longer than the previous match, but Gunn and Shamrock put on a better showing than the Road Dogg/Boss Man combination. (3/10)

(3) Gangrel vs X-Pac EU title. Our 3rd Raw quality match of the night, but mercifully it is short (The show up to this point feels like a rejected Raw episode that never aired). (3.5/10)

(4) Luna Vachon vs Sable strap match. There hasn't been much to talk about with the matches to this point, and this match is no exception. Highlights include a fan attacking Luna. (2/10)

(5) Mankind vs The Rock I quit match for the WWF title. This is an excellent match which is a VERY welcomed change from the mediocre undercard. The match itself tells a very good story, is well executed, and has the classic Mankind/Rock back story going in. Highlights include Mankind falling into electrical equipment, Mankind being handcuffed and Rock BEATING Mankind down with the chair until a pre-recording of Mankind saying I quit is played which for some reason ends the match. (8.5/10)

(6) The Royal Rumble match. Straight up one of the worst Rumble matches of all time. 1st off, for a match that is based on people being thrown over the ropes, it feels like it takes place outside of the ring more than it takes place inside of the ring. The MAJOR focus of this match is the Austin/McMahon story (so much so the commentators ignore in ring action, McMahon takes over commentary and the ring is left empty (I'm sure the live crowd loved that) to follow Austin/McMahon developments backstage). The way the match panned out exploited the ""must go over the top rope with both feet hitting the floor"" (which Howard Finkel emphasises AND repeats prior to the match) rule to the point where you are asking yourself ""what's the point in even getting in the ring when you can go back stage for 20 minutes, do some colour commentary and return once everyone is eliminated?"" . The way it was executed highlighted the flaws in the rules of the match, and ignored every competitor in favour of Austin and McMahon. The only surprise entrant is Mabel (who isn't even a real surprise because Cole mentions they've seen him earlier). (4.5/10)",1332806400,,2535,4.659955257270694

The ""I Quit"" match for the world title between The Rock & Mankind was a hardcore,blood-spilling,heart-stopping & nail-biting match of the year. The rest were pretty good/solid matches. I give this PPV a 10 out of 10.",1279497600,,310,4.980769230769231

watched almost all the Royal Rumbles and alot of them weren't
physical, but this one sure stands out!!!

We see a physical, hard hitting strap match between former employee/wrestler Sable -Rena Mero- and Luna.  The rivalry between the 2 has been going on for some time  and it comes to blow in this match. Both ladies take a beating and the better woman wins this match. I won't spoil it for you by saying who wins.

We also see a tough match between the 300 pounds of the Big Boss Man against the Road dog in Special Challenge match. Both men beat the hell out one another and it's a good match.

One memorable match is between Ken Shamrock and Billy Gunn for the IC Title. Before the match we see how this feud got started. Billy Gun proceeds to show his butt to Ken Shamrock's sister. Shamrock gets his revenge at the end.

The European Match between XPac and Gangrel is also a good match but not physical like the others but still alot of high flying moves from XPAC.

Speaking of high flying and physical the ""I Quit"" match between then Corporate Champion-The Rock, and then WWF Champion-Mankind is one of the greatest matches in WWF history even though the ending is a ripoff. We hear so much foul language in this match that I was laughing my head off, on top of that we get one of the most bloodiest matches in  history. If you have seen King of the Ring 98 between The Undertaker and Mankind, you can expect the same thing. Mick Foley sacrificing his body to put on quite a show. This is a Foley trademark and would be the subject of controversy as Foley did somewhat the dumb mistake of inviting his kids to see such a violent mess. This would be later recalled in ""Beyond The Mat"". Foley once said he was jealous of the Rock or implied that he was jealous certainly this wasn't his best moment but as Foley does he puts the business first.

Now the Royal Rumble is also a must see because its the only Rumble where Vince McMahon is a #2 in the Rumble and Stone Cold is #1, McMahon
has put a bounty on Stone Cold, but that doesnt prevent Stone Cold from beating the hell out of Vince.

A great Royal Rumble, if you haven't seen any of them make sure you see this one!!!

I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",1195084800,2,2280,4.303738317757009
7886691,5,6305255229,"Vince McMahon should get this pay per view on DVD right now, this had to be the best and funniest Royal Rumble I have ever seen. Although the Rock caused interference in the match Vince manage to throw the Stone Cold over the top rope. Great Rumble, hope it gets a DVD format.",1138924800,,276,4.226415094339623
