8659354,4,B00KITB020,"Bobby and B.J. (Billy Joe) work in a cotton mill; it's a dead end job in a dead end town. They have a best girl friend in Sue - whom B.J. likes to hit on. She is going to escape Hicksville by going to college to find a new life, and that is also the exact same plan that Bobby has. B.J. though is more of a free spirit with more confidence than is good for you and an unorthodox approach to chat up lines; he decides to send off his friends with a big, expensive blow out. Problem is they all have no money.

So B.J. robs the place where they work and off they go for a good bye party of high jinx and blow the lot. On their return things don't go to plan and they find out their boss is far from being an easy touch when it comes to being robbed - that is when they find out it can be a lot harder than you think to leave your past behind. What follows will be a learning curve for all of them so step that it will take all of their ingenuity to survive.

This is a very strong film, with a superb cast all doing above average performances. Mark Pelligrino (`The Big Lebowski') as the cotton mill boss - Griff - is particularly good as the evil but amusing bad guy. It also benefits from a fine script with such memorable lines as `It's not about the money - it's about the memories'. Some viewers will take umbrage with the final dnouement which I won't reveal so as not to spoil the plot, but I felt it still worked and worked well given the overall context. This is one that has not received much attention, which is a situation I feel ought to be reversed as this was a very enjoyable watch indeed.",1446249600,,1603,4.00625
