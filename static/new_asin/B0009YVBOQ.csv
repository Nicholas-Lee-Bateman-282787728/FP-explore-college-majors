8070653,1,B0009YVBOQ,I bought Shapes and Colors for my Grandson and was terribly disappointed. How can a DVD claim to be educational and have PENGUINS in ALASKA? This glaring error leads me to doubt the value of the the entire DVD. I threw it away.,1370217600,,227,4.3023255813953485
8070654,3,B0009YVBOQ,"My baby granddaughter stayed focused for a long time, so I'd say it is ok.  If it could hold her attention for the full length and then have her say ""again"" it would be five stars.  :-)",1361145600,,185,3.972972972972973
8070655,5,B0009YVBOQ,"Just like the Galloping Minds Alphabet and Phonics, the Shapes and Colors once again delivers what I believe one of the most amazing ways to teach my kids how to identify objects, shapes and colors, and see how amazingly this series stimulates their visual sense, not to mansion how well the music keeps them happy during the learning experience.",1316131200,2,346,4.88135593220339
8070656,5,B0009YVBOQ,"My grand children have enjoyed this DVD and learned the shapes and colors from this. It has a lot of information for kids about many different shapes and lots of colors. They liked the cute animations and I was pleased with the pace. Very educational, gentle. They display mixing of colors, combining shapes to form new shapes. Good DVD in my opinion and great teaching tool.",1311379200,2,375,4.696969696969697
8070657,1,B0009YVBOQ,"I bought this for my toddlers thinking it would be an easy way to help them start on their pre school curriculum. Yeah, the whole set of DVDs are basically a power point presentation burned onto a DVD with horrible graphics... My kids hated these DVDs, they would never let me play them for more than 5 minutes.",1308441600,,311,4.379310344827586
8070658,5,B0009YVBOQ,"This is a great DVD that teaches young kids (babies through preschoolers) shapes and colors. There are some cute animations to present the idea of shapes and colors to preschoolers. Initially colors are taught - later on in the DVD shapes are taught.

The DVD covers basic 2 dimensional shapes such as diamond, triangles, squares, circles and rectangles. It also covered a few 3 dimensional shapes such as sphere, pyramid etc. Many shapes come together to form new shapes. A wonderful learning tool -- Highly recommended!",1298764800,3,521,5.058139534883721
8070659,1,B0009YVBOQ,"I purchased this DVD as I saw some really great reviews on it and thought it would be a good place to start with my son (10 months) as we will be having a lot of travel over the next few months.  I was horribly disappointed the first few seconds into it.  The animations are terrible and come off really creepy, and my son wasn't even interested by it.  The quality of the DVD is really poor with a lot of glitches.  Too bad I can't return it!  I will not be purchasing any more Gallping Minds DVD's again.",1298246400,,506,4.070707070707071
8070660,5,B0009YVBOQ,Really cute. This DVD is the newest version of the Shapes and Colors DVD from Galloping Minds. It holds my son's attention and he enjoys the shapes and colors. I love the fact that this video is educational and fun. I am pleased with this buy.,1128384000,7,243,4.304347826086956
