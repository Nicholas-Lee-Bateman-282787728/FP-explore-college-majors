2073140,4,B0002AAMVU,"I orderedhis set of Ramayana DVDs. Box and packing was good but there were few DVDs with scratch on them. Contacted Seller and they promptly responded and sent me replacement for the defected DVDs. I am very happy with the customer service they provided. On the DVD picture quality side, I think there is a lot of scope of improvement. May be watching all high definition movies and Blue Ray has spolied me.

Overall this set is worth the amount I spent on this and I will definitely recommend the product",1338249600,,505,4.549450549450549
2073141,3,B0002AAMVU,"I bought this package recently . All the cds were there . and delivered in time also  But the dvd qualities are not upto the mark. Dvds were just put in individual paper cover and not in a dvd case . So dvds were getting sticked to the paper and you need to fight to remove them. Also due to this some of the dvds had a scratch and data loss. So some of the dvds were getting stuck in the middle and really irritating as you need to wait for half an hr to see the next scene.

I wanted to give it only a two stars but since it has subtitle gave 3 .",1259539200,10,548,3.7155172413793105
2073142,5,B0002AAMVU,"Just to be aware of producers of the Ramayan dvd set.  Moser Baer has cut important scenes from the original, thereby rendering it totally annoying to watch.  If this is not the Moser Baer version of the set, then go ahead and buy it because the serial itself is inspiring. Unfortunately, I got the Moser Baer version and it is cut in all the important places.  I think they really have no clue as to what is important or not.  Perhaps they don't even know what the content is.  Atleast it appears that way from the pieces they have cut.",1236816000,16,537,4.33
2073143,4,B0002AAMVU,"A GREAT EPIC. I enjoyed the story of Rama Sita Lakshman Hanuman etc.  The Drama and Dharma was extreme but showing the people with character.  It was violent always wars between good and evil. The english subtitles on every dvd 16 in all was poorly proof read.  Words were lopped off or a strange word in the body of a paragraph not making sense but the next frame all was well. There were bloopers in one frame Ravan threatening Sita and saying you have one day ....and the next frame says you will have one year.  The real annoying dvd was the 16th when the first 2 chapters of the 18 some odd chapters on the dvd had NO subtitle at all hindi thruout...then finally in chapter 3 english showed up.  ALL in all despite the poor proof reading was a great dramatic epic about faith, character and  duty.

Someone should tell Ramanand Sagar of the family staff proof reading skills...I know he would flip, he put such great effort in creating this old style special effects but good drama and music.  I think he should redo the english for us....I am presently viewing the Krishna it too has english booboos. Oh well. Not worth $95 american dollars (tax+shipping) but like our Bible it weaves a story of principles and a fabric of virtue.

The frightening part are the sages who perform curses I did not believe such things existed today until I too experienced Hindu Gurus cursing using evil on disciples they did not like.  Yes it was true they were Not perfect and did not like some people.  India has great knowledge but it does get into the hands of ambitious evil doers. Idol worship is extreme millions of gods and goddess' very pagan still; but the power is in the mantras great bliss, words have power good deeds and virtue is best.

2073144,5,B0002AAMVU,"An absolutely terrific epic. The good, the bad, the righteous, and the evil,who occured somewhere in history exist even to this day. There are demons, and there are gods in our acts, in our thoughts....This  immortal saga of love for humanity will sure revive the deepest thoughts of our inner conscience. A must watch embodiment of the milieu of human nature, victory of the good over the bad, and the warmth a human can have for another in the busy web of life.

2073145,5,B0002AAMVU,"I felt that this series was deeply moving and inspirational.  I loved the actors cast to play the parts.  They were perfect.

The story and the spirit are so alive that it takes little imagination to circumvent the less than modern

special effects.  Some may find those special effects distracting, but they didn't bother me at all.

I found myself so captivated that I could not tear myself away.  If I had been able to, I would have watched

the entire series, but alas, my job interfered so I was forced to move slowly, watching a disc/week.

I was on the edge of my seat between episodes and couldn't take my mind off of Ram and what may happen next.

This series is truly a ""must see"" for the avid religious folk among us, even if you are not Hindu.",1113091200,33,755,4.328571428571428
2073146,1,B0002AAMVU,"I was surprised to find this product on Amazon, given the marketing skill of Mr Sagar's team it is not surprising - but just sad to see how sub standard the product is, and in an international market the kind of impression it can create both about the epic as well as the way it is made. The serial made waves in northern india because it was released at a time when myth/religious fervour was somewhat low - and the north indian audience is somewhat less exposed to mythology on screen as compared to their southern counter parts. But for something made in modern times when technology and special effects are so advanced, the cardboard palaces and even wooden looking actors are not even bearable - a high school stage play could do better. Let alone the music(noise?) and dialogue.
Indian epics were dramatized best in south india, telugu particularly, in 50s and 60s. They had great music, photography, acting, and more than anything else devotion to art and attention to detail - both of which are sadly missing in the Sagar money making venture. Most prints available though do not have subtitles so may not appeal to a foreign audience.
The book version of the epic - Ramesh Menon, RK Narayan and so on are also equally interesting.

Grab this only if you cannot find any other version of the Ramayan and you either go by popularity ratings or have nothing better to do.",1100131200,18,1377,4.6204081632653065
8025040,5,B0002AAMVU,"I am watching the original DVD set.  It is where the heart is. don't expect this to be the modern epic, but a story with acting that is superb.  Not sure of the DVD quality some received.  I bought the DVD set some years ago after the first video conversion to DVD and it was rough.  Just watching these now. Its like a trip to the back country villages of India.  Don't expect to be sleeping at the Royal Taj, or  to be sitting front row at the academy of arts, but find a seat at the academy of the heart.  The same is true for the Krishna series by Sagar.  My wife and I love them both.  There's a lot of bad movies out there of great technical quality but put out with the worst intentions, and totally lacking in ethical value. For that we are starving. These are the bad movies that I would castigate. Think of it like an ancient text.  Disregard the distractions that are meaningless.",1500076800,,891,4.188235294117647

8025042,1,B0002AAMVU,"I was looking to buy this for last several years as I had watched the original telecast. But I was kind of hesitant to buy it buy this product looking at the reviews. Please note that this review is not about the original Ramayana series but about the quality of the DVDs. Finally, I made up my mind and ordered this product. It came in nicely packaged set of 16 DVDS. However the problem is that the video quality is just unacceptable. It's worse than the bad Video Cassette tape that we used to borrow from video libraries back in India (if anyone can remember what that means) . I am wondering why they can't have better quality picture. Even the very old black and white movies have better picture quality. You cannot certainly watch this on HD TV. On regular TV (CRT)  you may be able to watch it as long as the shot is close up. Otherwise everything is fuzzy. I am very happy to be able to return this product. Thanks to Amazon!!!

Well they aren't I have about 10 of the original VHS tapes from the shows. They have wonderful discourses before the actual film of the movies on each tape.
