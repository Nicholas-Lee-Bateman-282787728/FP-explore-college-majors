8510737,4,B00765DMLG,"It sounded like it should be a good mystery. There was no mystery. Filmed in a TV interview show style - like ""Dateline"". Interview then re-enactment, only in this case we saw what happened. I wouldn't call this English family eccentric.  They seemed more quirky, self-centered, not terribly cognizant and caught off-guard taking in a friendly stranger.  The dog was the only normal one and he had 3 legs.  And, yes, they do get accused of murdering the stranger, which they didn't do. Guilty of culpable stupidity.  I don't know that I'd watch it again, but it was droll and I don't begrudge the time.",1412812800,,602,4.704761904761905
8510738,5,B00765DMLG,"I very much disagree with the poor reviews. I am, in no way, associated with this film. I saw this film at the Chicago film festival and it was one of the hits. Our party of 4 all loved the film, as did the audience. A great black comedy with twists and turns.",1384387200,,260,3.9245283018867925
8510739,5,B00765DMLG,"What a most interesting and unique film this is. I've watched plenty of flicks lately but most haven't been worth much comment. Black Pond is certainly an exception.

The writing and direction are near flawless; Kingsley and Sharpe approach genius at times here, in that brilliantly subtle English way. You have to really pay attention to Black Pond, as lots of things happen on the sides of the screen very quietly, and the characters' facial expressions do a lot of the talking. I loved the camera placement and compositions, and what a relief to see a film with almost no handheld shots. Handheld is so overdone and just over by now; the greatest directors often simply stick the camera in one place, compose the shot perfectly, and have the actors work within the frame. This often results in the best performances, I think, as it's so much less intrusive than a bloke sticking his camera in your face as the grips etc chase around him.

And the cast here works very well within those constricts; there's not a duff performance in the lot. Chris Langham leads the way with a truly fine and quietly hilarious turn as the slightly barmy husband. He made me laugh out loud more than a few times. As did Simon Anstell, who delivers moments of true humor mixed with pathos, a combo that makes Black Pond so unique.

But it's the script that really steals the show here, as there are so many crisp and desert-dry lines that hit home in so many ways. It's a smart study of adult relationships, mental health and family, and the way the timeline is used and switched about is never confusing and most always perfect, which is exceedingly difficult to do well. The plot is also one of a kind, and after reading Langham's bio I have the notion that perhaps Kingsley and Sharpe made this specifically for him, as it echoes his own issues of the past decade, if in another form.

We are told up front that this family is blamed for this ""crime"", and then we see how it all really played out. I think this might be a show of sympathy and support for Langham's own situation, as his defense was rather like the plot here, unwieldy but altogether possible. No one's disowned Pete Townshend since he was revealed to be a bit of an Uncle Ernie, while Langham never gets work any more, and Pete had the same defense as Langham, so who knows what's really going on. And that's the point of Black Pond as well: real life plays out in ways that those who aren't there at the moment can never really understand.

There are so many fine moments in Black Pond, and so many very subtly humorous scenes, that it's hard to recall a film this seemingly slow that's also this funny and smart. I enjoyed watching the perfect compositions so much that the film never became slow. Quality artistry goes a long way towards keeping one engrossed! The natural lighting also works magnificently, and gives the film a lush feel that studio lighting never could.

And gee whiz, this lovely and beautiful film was made for 25,000 pounds! I have seen many films in the last few months made for one or two thousand times that much that are nowhere near as well-shot or intelligent or satisfying as this tiny little independent gem. The news is out: you don't need big budgets or even medium budgets to make good movies. All it takes is great writing and a tiny crew and cast who care. Major props to everyone involved in Black Pond for showing the film world what value really looks like. 25K?! I'd be ashamed of my budget if I was most filmmakers after seeing this. What a coup.

Bravo to Kingsley and Sharpe for brilliance on all fronts, and for making a work of cinematic art like this on such a crazy tiny budget. The one extra, a very cool little all-in-one blooper/making-of/tribute reel, shows how few people worked on this, and that makes its quality even more remarkable. I predict that we will see some seriously classic work from Kingsley and Sharpe in the future, and I for one really look forward to the laughs and the artistry.",1377043200,4,4004,4.537396121883656
8510740,4,B00765DMLG,"I don't think this would appeal to the vast majority of American movie watchers, but I liked it, found it to be cerebral, dark humor, and the acting excellent. No action here, just drama, but very interesting and well written.",1375056000,2,226,4.675
8510741,1,B00765DMLG,"This movie is terrible! The plot is thin and difficult to follow, the direction is poor and the ""reality"" cinematography is not well done. I chose this movie based upon the 5 star reviews. Obviously, those reviews were by someone connected to the movie or the reviewers were paid to write good reviews. If you want to give away $3.99, give it to a homeless person, it will be much better spent than wasting it on this movie.",1375056000,4,424,4.448717948717949
8510742,5,B00765DMLG,"Tom Thompson played by the very talented, Chris Langham meets a 'funny' bloke whilst out walking his three legged dog, which is not called tripod, but `Boy'. This turns out to be Blake (Colin Hurley he was in `Holby City'). Despite being not completely normal, but then again who is, Tom invites him back for a cup of tea. Whilst he comes back he sort of rekindles the relationship that has been dying between Tom and his wife Sophie (Amanda Hadingue) and they start to get on and have conversations, which they both find strange. He breaks the cathartis of the shell of a relationship with the love long gone, and he reawakens the passions that forms the very fibres of life

The story is told mostly in the form of interviews with the various family members and then revisited in flash back. So we know pretty early on that Blake is going to die, just how and the reasons for the big hullaballoo that occurred after wards will take its time to be revealed. We also have the two daughters and their friend Tim, who we see visiting the self appointed `shrink' Eric Sacks played by erudite comedian Simon Amstell. He is a total `bar steward' too but in a really funny way. After the first tragedy the whole family get together to support each other and then things get very weird very quickly but with the humour being piled on through out.

This is a dark comedy that is very original, very human and very funny. Even the music score is good and everyone puts in a splendid performance especially Colin Hurley who plays the emotional and almost nakedly honest Blake in such a caring and understanding way. From new comers writers and directors Tom Kingsley and Will Sharpe who have done themselves proud with this brilliant piece of cinema. One of the best British comedies in a while or since `In The Loop', and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.",1353801600,9,1855,4.485207100591716
