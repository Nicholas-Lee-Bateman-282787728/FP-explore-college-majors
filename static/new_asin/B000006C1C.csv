7904054,3,B000006C1C,"This action film is packed with unforeseen developments. Police work is a real adventure, even if the cops succeed in Taiwan without causing too much damage around them. It is rather clean for the passers-by, the on-lookers. What's more it is more a comedy than a drama : it is full of humor and fun. Those actors are able to bleed and smile at the same time. That's reassuring, even if unrealistic, about cops. We would like to see such cops more often... The subject of the film is banal. Drug traffickers are using all means they can to transfer their cocain and their dollars, even diplomatic immunity of course. They also bring together South America, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. That was before 1999. I guess the Chinese have already cleaned up the plate in Hong Kong a little bit. But this vision of Asians being the strongest and most powerful drug dealers in the world is in a way funny. This maffia is not very clean, but neither are the North American or European maffias. But, well, you cannot always entertain and educate at the same time. It's fun though to think that in twenty years China will be the first economic power in the world. Will we still dare to show such films or will they have died a long time before ?
