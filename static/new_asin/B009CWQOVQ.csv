5315540,4,B009CWQOVQ,"Brought back childhood memories. When there were no recording devices, no vcrs, no DVDs or dvrs or TiVo. A simpler time when a musical on tv was a big event, like watching the Wizard of Oz every year. And after all, it's Rogers and Hammerstein! A very young Leslie Ann Warren and a brilliant Celeste Holm",1446940800,7,304,4.446428571428571
5315541,2,B009CWQOVQ,"The sets are terrible, the acting is terrible, yet I still enjoy this movie.",1446336000,,76,4.5
5315542,5,B009CWQOVQ,The absolute best Cinderella ever! Plain and simple. I can't believe it's been 50 years,1445990400,4,87,4.866666666666666
5315543,5,B009CWQOVQ,"By far, Lesley Ann Warren has portrayed the best performance of the ""Cinderella Story"". Superb acting as well as dancing. Most impressive of all is the lovely and breath taking gown that she wears at the ball. An outstanding performance of what it is to be poor, humble and meek and to finally fulfill one's impossible dream. I gave this an undisputable rating of 5 stars.  Truly a classic to own and cherish for eternity. ""You go, girl""!",1445644800,12,438,4.615384615384615
5315544,5,B009CWQOVQ,"This older version of Cinderella, is the absolute best. The cast is magical together. Every little girl should see this one!",1416441600,,124,4.9523809523809526
5315545,5,B009CWQOVQ,"I remember when I was 6 years old this movie Cinderella was the most Fantasy exciting movie ever, and here it is again. WOW!",1515283200,,124,4.208333333333333

5315547,5,B009CWQOVQ,"I still remember waiting each year for this on television.  As so many have said, it was a lovely show - even allowing for the 1964 stage sets.  Leslie Ann Warren was so young and vulnerable, Stuart Damon was handsome, with a wonderful voice and the supporting cast were all great performers from stage and film.  Both music and acting are delightful and sweet - including a wonderfully vain stepmother and two stepsisters, who were a hoot.",1512777600,,440,4.688311688311688
5315548,3,B009CWQOVQ,"I love the story of Cinderella.  The cast features some excellent actors.  This version is a disaster.  Looks like some cheap made for television where every shortcut in music, sets and costumes that could be taken was.  There are so many excellent versions of this movie that it would be an insult to watch this and not something with the richness that a Rodgers & Hammerstein presentation should possess.  Pass on this and look for something better.",1507075200,,451,4.805194805194805
5315549,5,B009CWQOVQ,This Cinderella reminds me when I was very young.  I loved it then and I love it now! Wonderful movie......love the songs and singing by the talented actors at a time when it was movies were simple and innocent!,1506816000,,211,4.410256410256411
5315550,2,B009CWQOVQ,Cannot recommend this to anyone.,1506124800,,32,5.6
5315551,2,B009CWQOVQ,Dated and low budget. My kiddo (who does _not_ watch flashy shows as all and very little tv in general) asked me to shut it off as soon as they started singing.,1503964800,,160,4.03125
5315552,1,B009CWQOVQ,"You forced me to buy this DVD, since the prime ""free"" one had no sound! Ugh

5315553,5,B009CWQOVQ,"LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. I watched this on tv every year as a young girl in the 60's.  Was in awe of the music and costumes and I still am today. The love story captured my heart, esp the way the prince smiles as he sings. Be still my beating heart.  Cannot wait to introduce my granddaughter to this beautiful version of Cinderella.",1501372800,,326,4.241935483870968
5315554,3,B009CWQOVQ,"Sweet natured movie from a simpler time. This might seem unfair but Disney's Cinderella is so memorable from both a production and musical standpoint that it was hard to not compare the two even though they are completely different. The performances were a little wooden, but it was a fascinating look at a television special from a long time ago.",1500854400,,347,4.8
5315555,4,B009CWQOVQ,Beautiful classic musical that the whole family can watch.,1500336000,,58,5.555555555555555
5315556,5,B009CWQOVQ,"A wonderful childhood memory.  Beautiful music and great actors. What's not to like?  I texted my sisters through the entire show and sent them clips. Felt like I was laying on the floor in the living room at 8 years old, chin in hands,
 enchanted all over again.",1499731200,,263,4.4375

5315559,5,B009CWQOVQ,Blast from the past with a perfect cast!,1499212800,,40,4.125
5315560,5,B009CWQOVQ,"Yes, the movie is cheesy! Yes, the sets are amateurish! Yes, the costumes are ridiculous and the choreography laughable! But, hey, it was 1965 and this version of Cinderella was every girl's fantasy come to life. The prince is handsome, Leslie Ann Warren's crooked smile is endearing, and the stepmother and stepsisters hilariously evil. Both Ginger Rogers and Ms. Warren (who studied ballet) dance. It used to be so easy to please us. It's refreshing to revisit this childhood favorite.",1499040000,5,487,5.1
5315561,5,B009CWQOVQ,"I have loved this since I first watched it as a child and just finished watching again at 57, and still love it.  I had just been thinking of it the other day and there it just popped up and I am glad to have found it again.  Simple yet enjoyable.  I love all of those stars and they were wonderful to watch.",1498780800,,308,3.857142857142857

5315563,4,B009CWQOVQ,"I have one thing to say to all the negative reviewers: 1965. What did you expect? Green screens and CGI? Obviously, it's dated. Of course, it's cheesy. It's Cinderella, for crying out loud! For the nine-year-old me it was enchanting, romantic and wonderful. Ha! And I still remembered all the words. So if you insist on watching this with a modern mindset where you expect 2017 cinematic technology and action scenes you're wasting your time here. Celeste Holmes can be my fairy godmother anytime. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm headed back to the moonlit garden and my prince... ""Do I love you because you're beautiful? Or are you beautiful because I love you...""",1498176000,6,663,4.824561403508772

5315567,4,B009CWQOVQ,"I grew up with this music - Julie Andrews as Cinderella on the CBS original recording. While this version isn't as vocally spectacular, it was a once a year celebration and a joy to watch and sing along to as a child. One of the reasons I love the film Victor/Victoria is the glee of appreciating two Cinderellas performing alongside the Music Man. Thank you Amazon for bringing back such wonderful memories.",1498003200,,408,4.680555555555555
5315568,5,B009CWQOVQ,I love this movie it is the best Cinderella movie Lesley Ann Warren is a beautiful Cinderella with a great voice the prince is so handsome,1498003200,,138,4.346153846153846
5315569,5,B009CWQOVQ,Talk about fond memories! I watched this so many times as a child! Ignore the dated movie making and enjoy the magic of the story. It's my most favorite version of Cinderella ever made. And--it's Roger's and Hammerstein!!,1497916800,,221,4.842105263157895
5315570,5,B009CWQOVQ,"Watched this as a kid every year it was broadcast - happily surprised to find it on Amazon. Today's musicals could take a lesson from Rodgers & Hammerstein on how to create the flow of dialogue and song such as this.  Celeste Holmes and Walter Pigeon are treasures. And what a voice Stuart Damon has. Thanks, Amazon!",1497657600,2,316,4.543859649122807
5315571,5,B009CWQOVQ,The best Cinderella ever and a classic from the 60's. I grew up watching this. The costumes are still beautiful and the songs are so memorable. There are a few Hollywood royalty in this movie also.,1495238400,,197,4.5
5315572,5,B009CWQOVQ,"Just like many other people from my generation, I watched this movie every year. It's hard to imagine a time when we waited for the Wizard of Oz and Cinderella because they were the only main TV movies we had as children. I loved this version Cinderella- the song In My Own Little Corner is my favorite.",1494201600,,303,4.333333333333333
5315573,1,B009CWQOVQ,"I like musicals, I like R&H, yet, I thought the songs in this show were boring.  Looking over other reviews, I think this is a nostalgia piece for many, but not interesting for a first time viewer who is already an adult.",1493856000,2,221,4.261904761904762
5315574,5,B009CWQOVQ,"Just as magical and wonderful as I remembered as a girl. Like others have said, I too, waited all year to see this on TV each year. Thank you Amazon for putting this on Prime. This is a lovely classic. Lesley Ann Warren is so sweet and lovely. I'm sitting here in tears just enjoying the beauty and innocence of this production. I love everything about it.",1493683200,,356,4.3283582089552235
5315575,4,B009CWQOVQ,"Memorable show from my childhood. Having grown up loving Rogers and Hammerstein musicals, this was a treat back then and after all these years was a treat to see once again; here I am 60 years old now. The most minimal made-for-60's-tv stage set, it had that dated feeling. It would have been absolutely corny and totally outdated but you know, I wasn't at all put off by it...., only because of the reasons above and songs so memorable i could have sang them word for word without having seen this movie in probably more than 40 years. I guess like someone else said here, this was shown a few years in a row so maybe that's why it grew on us so much. Just looked at the date, and I would have been 9  years old when this came out. If you relate to any of the above, and like a Cinderella story, you would probably like it.",1492905600,6,824,4.182389937106918
5315576,5,B009CWQOVQ,This was an annual event at our house each year and to me it is just as charming and delightful to watch now as it was then.  We had the only color tv in the neighborhood and all of our friends would come over to watch it each year.  My dad would pop up buckets of popcorn for the show. We had so much fun. I remember thinking that Cinderella's dress was the most beautiful dress I'd ever seen.  I would always cry at the end and I still do even after all these years. Such a beautiful and pure story.,1492732800,,501,3.9405940594059405

5315578,5,B009CWQOVQ,"Do I love you because you're beautiful? Or are you beautiful because I love you? A dream within a dream. This beautiful production is more like an opera, play, or luxurious musical (and if those types of art are not to your taste then stick with the animated Disney or version of this story). Exquisite costumes, lovely sets, and fine acting. This movie has a magical quality that modern movie sets are sometimes unable to duplicate. Stardust gets in your eyes if you watch this enchanting film. Trust me, it is possible. Charming, beautiful moments, for the  zany, this film is for the fools among us who love the magical possibilities of life and hope. Happy viewing~*",1491782400,12,670,4.726495726495727
5315579,2,B009CWQOVQ,"I really enjoyed other Rodgers & Hammerstein's productions, but I won't be humming any tunes or reciting any dialog from this one.  Too bad, they had some big talents.",1491350400,2,167,4.758620689655173
5315580,5,B009CWQOVQ,This was my favorite movie as a child.  Leslie Ann Warren and Damon were a great duo.  Beautiful color.  Loved the costumes.  Loved the music.  You will love this one.,1491004800,3,167,4.433333333333334

5315582,5,B009CWQOVQ,Nice to see a different version. My daughter and I enjoyed it.,1490659200,,62,4.25
5315583,5,B009CWQOVQ,Brings back a lot of childhood memories. Had no idea Ginger Rogers played the Queen. Leslie A Warren still looks good today at 70......such a treat to see a clean wholesome film with great actors. Pat Carroll is always funny....great one for family to watch.,1490572800,2,258,4.7555555555555555
5315584,5,B009CWQOVQ,"How could you not love anything from Rogers and Hammerstein?  Yes, its set like a theater production and yes, it shows it was made in the 60's but every little girl wants to be Cinderella and will be singing those wonderful songs all her life.",1489708800,2,243,4.4
5315585,5,B009CWQOVQ,I remember watching this movie many years ago when it was the first broadway music to be made for tv. I Have loved this movie since Ihe first time I saw it I the middle 60s. I will add it to my movie collection. I'm glad to ave finally found it.,1489622400,,245,3.823529411764706
5315586,5,B009CWQOVQ,"David Lee Roth once noted that the rolling Stone's ""Satisfaction"" may not be the technically perfect track ... but that it is got IT.

So it is with Cinderella from 1965, especially with Lesley Ann Warren's sweet title character. Miss Warren does not have the voice of Julie Andrews (who originated the roll in 1958) and it occasionally shows, but I cannot see it even now without wishing her to find her deserved prince.",1489536000,,421,4.6891891891891895

5315590,5,B009CWQOVQ,"The music and lyrics of Roger and Hammerstein is just great.  Hammerstein captures the essence of commonly shared human emotions in the selection of a few simple words to represent powerful truths. Main focus is on Cinderella, but if you watch carefully, the heart of the prince is also captured in the story.",1489104000,,309,4.830188679245283
5315591,2,B009CWQOVQ,"Oh my. It's Rogers & Hammerstein, so if you love their music, buy the sheet music and learn it. The signing is atrocious.

But the music is just wonderful, and for people like me, who were too young for the original Rogers and Hammerstein's Cinderella with Julie Andrews, Lesley Ann Warren is Cinderella.

The stars are only part of the magic in this live stage production from 1965.  The sets and costumes are all beautiful; magical.  Besides Miss Warren, the production includes Ginger Rogers (the queen), Walter Pidgeon (the king); Celeste Holme (fairy godmother); Pat Carroll (stepsister) and a very young Stuart Damon as the Prince, who later went on to daily fame as Dr. Alan Quartermaine in the soap 'General Hospital'.  The score by Rodgers and Hammerstein is lovely and charming.  I saw this as a little girl and just adored it.  I still do.",1478476800,8,649,4.801801801801802

5315774,5,B009CWQOVQ,"By today's standards, this is less than low tech, but for those of us who recall watching this once/year on TV in the 60's, it is a real treat. Leslie Ann Warren was a beautiful young woman then and as I watch this over 40 years later, I still see what I saw then and felt the chemistry between Cinderella and the Handsome Prince. I can still remember the majority of the lyrics and realize how clever the writing was on watching this as an adult.

So wishing they had had DVD's and instant digital movies back in the 1960's!

For the longest time, I thought it was filmed in black and white .... I thought so because we only had a black & while television!  The wicked stepmother is wicked, the two step-sisters are snarkily despicable, and the fairy godmother is wonderfully kind and with such a good heart.  The prince is so regal and so unbelievably handsome.  But most of all it's Lesley Ann Warren herself as Cinderella who makes this work.  Such a beautiful young waif of a thing. It's not possible not to be captivated by her eyes each time she's on screen.  She was all the little boys first crush, and all the little girls wanted to be her.",1477094400,27,738,4.343065693430657

She plays Queen Mother to Prince charming and Walter Pidgeon plays his father.  Lesley Ann  Warren plays The role of Cinderella and I think she did a wonderful job. It looks to me like this may have been her first, or one of her first acting roles. I had no idea that she could sing. There are some musical numbers which are by Rogers and Hammerstein. They more thatn anything else, reminded me that I had seen this long ago. Overall I truly enjoyed watching this show.

Sometimes the things we remember as a child don't quite hold muster as we grow older, but that can not be said of  the Rodgers and Hammersteins wonderful musical version of Cinderella! I found myself remembering every word to every song. I will say though that my 3 year old granddaughter was a bit confused because Cinderella didn't have blonde hair or a blue dress, but she soon warmed up to it.",1476230400,,597,4.477064220183486

5315990,5,B009CWQOVQ,"Brought back memories of my childhood....IMO, of All of the Cinderella TV versions, This 1965 Classic is by and far the BEST! The acting, singing, staging, dancing and of course the Genius of Rodgers and Hammerstein provided the most beautiful, romantic, and humorous (Stepsister's Lament perfectly performed by Barbara Ruick and the hilarious Pat Carroll) for the Cinderella Production. Lesley Ann Warren (at only 18) basically stole the show and it launched her into stardom ! (Victor/Victoria and others - TV and Film). I'm so Proud to now own the 50th Anniversary DVD and every time I watch it...it just seems to get better and better.....A Masterpiece like no other version....with an all-star cast including (a very young and not very well known)Stuart Damon - as the Prince - later to go on to be an integral character on the Soap 'General Hospital' as Alan Quartermaine (sp)? Nowhere else will you see the likes of Hollywood Legends such as Ginger Rogers, Walter Pidgeon, Jo Van Fleet, and the Wonderful Talent of Celeste Holmes as the 'Fairy GodMother'! All of these Icons on one stage couldn't help but contribute to the Pure ""Magic and Romance"" of CBS's 1965 version of Cinderella!! I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!  Thanks for putting this Classic on DVD- Restored and Digitally Remastered Video and Audio enhance the entire experience! GREAT JOB !!!!",1476144000,4,1376,4.931034482758621

Many classic movie stars are in it and to all your General Hospital fans, so is Stuart Damen. What a voice! He should have done more musicals. If your a true fan of musicals, watch it. I'm not sure but this was probably the first Roger and Hammerstein musical of Cinderella ever done.

5316069,5,B009CWQOVQ,"I watched this movie on television as a child.  I have always loved it.  My sister loved it too and we would sing the songs aloud together.  The music and choreography are outstanding!  Watching Cinderella and the Prince waltzing is mesmerizing.  The actors seem spot on for their roles.  The songs ""The Prince is Giving a Ball"" and ""Why does a fellow love a girl like her?"" are hilarious.  I used the song ""Ten Minutes Ago"" at my wedding.  Some nights I just play the music on my tablet as I go to sleep.  It's one of my all-time favorites.",1468540800,11,541,4.33

Warning: this musical was made a LONG time ago inside a sound stage; the sets are laughable, and some of the acting as well, but I still love it, love the story. I LOVE the song and expressions of the two stepsisters when they're at the ball singing about the girl they don't realize is Cinderella. I love the prince sternly commanding the stepmother and stepsisters to halt as they try to stop Cinderella from going to him.",1462924800,4,510,4.322916666666667

As an adult, I wish the sets didn't show the characters staring off at the castle that was actually painted behind them, that the singing was a tad smoother and less shrill, and that the step sister with the creeky knee had more screen time.",1458259200,,419,4.441558441558442

8539757,2,B009CWQOVQ,"Campy and cheesy. This low-budget (made for TV) version of Cinderella has the same look as a Carol Burnett parody, including the cardboard cutout sets and cartoonish acting. Everything was clearly done on a soundstage.

Despite the presence of Rogers and Hammerstein, there are few memorable songs and the story is told in a boring, pedestrian way. Lesley Ann Warren is pretty, but her acting is so cutesy you almost wish one of the ugly stepsisters would have married the Prince. Not being a Baby Boomer, I can't see this through the lens of nostalgia. There are better versions of the story elsewhere, such as the Disney version.",1527379200,,631,4.842592592592593
