1233346,5,B00000JKNV,"this was a good movie, the end was sad for me though, I am a really big fan of the one who got the boot at the end, I was crying, they never even considered her feelings, okay movie though, it was not as dirty as the  rating, but I suggest you listen to it anyways, the music was fantastic but  the drawing style was a little different then in the previous movies, but  not to the extent of tenchi in tokyo (yuk) I just cant belive that this is  the last one, the ending still leaves me wondering about the future, I am  not satisfyed! luv the chase music though!",938217600,,563,4.036036036036036
1233367,5,B00000JKNV,"6 months after Tenchi wandered into the forest and disappeared Ryoko and Ayeka continue to search the country for him. Washu discovers that he is in an alternate universe and has a new lover. Tenchi is living with a girl named Haruna and they are in love. Ayeka and Ryoko must jog his memory and bring him back home.

This is the final Tenchi movie. It has better animation than the rest of the Universe series. All the old voice actors are back, so it feels like it fits. This movie, however, is a lot more emotional than the rest of the series. It has a different pace to it than what we are used to. This movie is a very slow paced and serious story, with a lot of emotion. Even though it still feels like you are watching Tenchi, there's a very different vibe. I think that's what I liked so much about this movie. I like to rate the quality of an anime by the amount of emotion it made me feel. This one brings forth many emotions. I rate it 5 stars!",1350691200,,955,4.134408602150538
1233368,5,B00000JKNV,"Before the third and final Tenchi movie, Tenchi as a whole had been hit and miss for me, ranging from 7/10 to 8/10 in terms of ratings. I enjoyed the first two OVA series but quickly grew tired of all the silliness and the lack of explanations with regards to various plot elements. It started to get stale after the harem cast had been assembled. My thoughts about the first two movies are very similar to my thoughts about the OVA. So, I didn't go into what's most likely going to be the last Tenchi anime I watch expecting anything other than the usual harem fluff, with a random, one dimensional villain thrown in so that there would be a fight to end it with a sense of purpose.

It ended up surpassing my expectations by some distance. I found it to be emotionally moving and involving - I couldn't help but care about the characters. However, it isn't something for Tenchi fans; it's for fans of well written and executed films. It has a low MAL rating - on par with the Christmas special of a second film - and I understand why without even asking anyone: because it lacks the feel of the other Tenchi anime in existence. If what came before is classed as Tenchi for the younger generation, then this is most certainly Tenchi for adults.

To start with, the art differs from the art of the previous films, both of which looking like the OVA series. I wouldn't say the previous art looks cartoony but it doesn't exactly look realistic either. The intention was clearly to make this installment more realistic to go with the story, and they started by altering the art. The faces look more realistic, the size/proportions of the characters look more realistic... everything apart from the ears and eyes looks realistic. This is a weird complaint to have but the ears bothered me, Ryoko's bothering me the most. Instead of having ears, it looks like a number of characters have rectangles stuck to the sides of their heads. I'm not sure if Ryoko always had rectangled for ears and the different art style simply made me notice, but whoever designed the ears deserves to be shot. Repeatedly.

The music also differs considerably from what's gone before, changing to fit with the new direction. In the past fitting but uninspiring and unmemorable efforts good for comedy were used, but in this there are drama orientated instrumental pieces. Even 'tude No. 3' - the famous piano piece - plays towards the end.

...Anyway, getting back on track. The story starts in normal Tenchi style; with Ayeka and Ryoko fighting like cat and dog and Tenchi getting involved. But within minutes (literally), Tenchi randomly stumbles upon a tree and, enchanted by its beauty, walks toward it. He then gets taken somewhere by a mysterious woman who appears before him.

The plot than fast-forwards six months. Tenchi has been missing and his harem have split up to search for him. Ayeka and Ryoko, who have teamed up, have managed to find out the city he's living in thanks to Washu and they work as waitresses while living there to pay the bills. Ryoko has a watch that alerts her to Tenchi's presence but hasn't had any luck finding him.

It's soon revealed that an older looking Tenchi, complete with long hair, has been living with the woman who appeared before him at the start. The woman is called Haruna and Tenchi has lost all of his memories. And when I say living together, I mean they live together as a couple, doing what couples do when alone. It's normal for anything sexual in a harem to be used only for comical purposes, without any actual sexual intercourse taking place, but there's nothing comical about Tenchi and Haruna's relationship. They're shown together in bed, naked, with Haruna on top of Tenchi early on and later Haruna moves herself slowly up Tenchi whilst he lies down, grinding her body against his.

I'm mentioning this and going into detail because it highlights the different audience the film is aimed at. Sex goes from being childish to being handled in a far more mature fashion. That's quite a jump for what was, before this attempt, a simple and straight-forward harem story involving alien ladies.

Once it's clear how Tenchi's living, the plot starts moving slower. The first twenty minutes flew by - I was surprised by the pacing - but then everything slowed down for character development. Ayeka and Ryoko become more and more depressed with every glimpse of Tenchi happy; oblivious to their existence. Despite them being rivals for Tenchi's affection when down in the dumps, rather than fight over Tenchi, they support each other. Ryoko pushes Ayeka's buttons when she's on the verge giving up and Ayeka tries to do the same for Ryoko. It's fair to say their friendship and not the rivalry they're known for shines through in the film.

All of the other development is, as you'd expected, Tenchi and Haruna development, mixed in with some Yosho (Tenchi's grandfather) development because of his connection to Haruna. The other cast members basically just make cameo appearances. Tenchi comes across differently than the plain harem lead type from before; he's far more troubled and always deep in thought, drawing in an attempt to express himself and the memories that lurk in the back of his mind. Haruna, who is the villain of the story, tries to keep Tenchi ignorant in an attempt to keep him close to her and ease her lonliness. Rather than being yet another one dimensional Tenchi baddie, she's well developed and by the end you can't help but feel sorry for her.

The important characters all receive lots of development, and the story even fills in some small Yosho related holes. The only serous flaw is that, as I mentioned before, it doesn't have the same vibe as the other Tenchi anime. It's very serious, focusing almost fully on drama. There are very few comedy scenes and the cast only gets together at the end. If I was someone who loved Tenchi for being light-hearted fun, I wouldn't be best pleased, so I can understand the problem people have with it... but I'm not one of those people and I respect those in charge for trying something different.

Overall, watching the film was an excellent way to end my Tenchi love affair. I was expecting to end it with yet another 7/10 rating, but I ended up awarding it 9/10 and actually thinking highly of a Tenchi offering. To anyone other than diehard Tenchi fans who can't accept change, I strongly recommend it.

Rating: 9/10",1248307200,,6422,4.708815672306322
1233369,5,B00000JKNV,"This movie really strikes a different mood for the ""Tenchi Muyo!"" series. Restrained, melancholy... even poetic. Light on swordplay and spaceships, heavy on character insight and development. The animation is beautiful, with sleeker, more mature-looking character designs that really complement the film's tone.

It's the story of a spirit from Katsuhito's past, who draws Tenchi into a parallel world just beyond Ryoko and Ayeka's reach. He doesn't remember his former life, but is compelled to draw sketches of a certain green-haired demon... Yes, Ryoko fans (like myself) will find a lot to like here. Everyone has to work together to bring Tenchi back, which ends up involving a little of the usual sci-fi heroics, but mostly the film focuses on Ryoko and Ayeka and how they relate to each other. The emotional payoff of the ending is quite moving.

Fantastic English dub too. Tenchi fans, give this wonderful movie a chance!",1145750400,,929,5.145695364238411

1233371,5,B00000JKNV,"ok, overall, they give this one an 8, but the first one a 7.4??? WHAT THE HELL'S UP WITH THAT? this is a very depressing movie. the love triangle between Aeka, Ryoko, and Tenchi is, well",1126828800,,186,4.194444444444445
1233372,5,B00000JKNV,"This is a good movie..very touching.  It was very different than your normal Tenchi shows.  It had a more serious style to it, there was more romance than action.  The animation was quite weird to me at first but I after awhile I learned to appreciate the beauty of the movie. Nontheless it is an excellent movie. I recommended to any Tenchi fan out there.

(!spoiler!) Ok..some say he does not choose but the matter of the truth is he does. He chooses Ryoko! Which made me very happy, being  a Tenchi and Ryoko fan myself, but he does indeed chooses. I kinda figured after watching the last episode of Tenchi Universe. I was reading some kind of thing where they were interviewing the creator of Tenchi and he does say that Tenchi indeeds chooses Ryoko in this movie. I know it was a weird way of not showing it. I, too wish that the creators would make it more clearly whom Tenchi chooses. So we can finally all be at peace.

So for all you Tenchi and Ryoko fans out there. just hope for the OAV 3 for him to finally make a choice. And show it in a more clear and direct way.

OVERALL: buy this movie. It is absolutely wonderful and beautifully done. And go buy the new Tenchi OAV 3! Support Tenchi!  Thank you for reading!",1122249600,,1225,4.2956521739130435
1233373,4,B00000JKNV,"This wasn't my really what i had expected. There was hardly any action in this movie, but most of it was drama. If your a person who enjoys a good movie to watch with your girlfriend then mayby this is the movie for you. this is definitly not for children because there is mature contents(saying this probably promotes younger people to watch this). This reveals about Yosho's first love and the only thing i liked about this was probably the ending music to the movie. My recommendation is that if you liked the first two movies then this is a major turn around for the series because there was hardly any violence and most of it was just watching tenchi going around in a parallel universe with another girl instead of with ayeka and ryoko.",1113955200,,742,4.503703703703704
1233374,3,B00000JKNV,"When my mom rented this movie for me, I expected it to have all the regular action of the other movies. Instead I found it to be a bit... shocking. The animation was different from the first and the part where Tenchi and Haruna do ""it"" weirded me out. Other than that it had a very good story line and I would NOT recomend it for younger fans.",1111190400,,343,4.0588235294117645
1233375,4,B00000JKNV,"For me, the anime Tenchi Muyo and Tenchi universe are great. Wonderful stories and characters, the best being Ryoko. The movies, which are based on Tenchi Universe, are also excellent, though Tenchi: the daughter of darkness felt like one extended episode. But, i'm here to review a beautifully animated film, called tenchi forever, the third, and unfortunatley, final film for the Tenchi Universe series. The story is wonderful, the animation is some of the best i've seen in an anime, and the relationship with Ryoko and Ayeka is interesting to behold.

For any Tenchi fans expecting the action/comedy normally associated with all the series, this is a simple love story, with enough sci-fi elements to keep you happy. I felt this is the art film, to show Tenchi can be a more serious franchise when it wants. Though i said the animation was wonderful, i missed the original look of the characters, from the OVA and Universe series, and even in the first Tenchi film. Though thats just a bit of nit picking. Now here's my real problem with the film, since it's the last of the Tenchi Universe saga. It's the end (spoiler). In the beginning of the film, Ryoko and Ayeka tell Tenchi to choose who he cares for most. Then he runs of in to the forest and vanishes. Ryoko and Ayeka search for him. Tenchi is much older and living with a strange woman and Tenchi is an Art student, with no memory of who he really is, but he keeps drawing a face on a canvas, and the face is Ryokos. Hint there that shes the one he cares for. Now at the end, Tenchi and Ryoko have this moment, but its only a hint that he has shown her he likes her, then it finishes. It's one of those endings where you're going to have to imagine, and i hate them. I wish they'd do a 4th, just to give us the answer we want. I only just got it, and was waiting to watch it for four years (since 2000), so maybe i spoiled it for myself because of the hype surrounding it, and building my hopes up. But hey, it's still a great film, and a must for Tenchi fans. Just don't expect a clear answer, if an answer at all, to who Tenchio really cares for (i really do hope he told Ryoko he loves her).

Anyway, look out for the third OVA series, which will give you an answer on who Tenchi cares for. As the OVA is the original Tenchi series, and Tenchi Universe is based on that series, I hope the OVA does a better job of the love story the Universe, and gives you a clear cut answer. Ryoko or Ayeka (Ryoko all the way)",1103587200,2,2476,4.288461538461538
1233376,5,B00000JKNV,"I was a little anxious to watch this, with all the mixed reviews.  I've watched the entire OVA series and the first 2 movies, and many episodes of Tenchi Universe, and have become a huge fan.  While I enjoy watching Ryoko and Ayeka bicker and fight, and the hijinx that ensue, and the huge battle scenes, and everything else that is missing from this movie, I was not disappointed.  This movie is for all the Tenchi fans that have watched all of the other episodes and movies and wished Tenchi would just say what's in his heart concerning Ryoko and Ayeka.  Let's just say it took a more mature Tenchi to finally say SOMEthing at the end of this movie, and it was worth the wait.  This movie is definitely more mature in content and meaning, and will appeal more to the adult Tenchi fans that see the entire series as more of a troubled romantic comedy than a sci-fi cartoon.",1091577600,,875,4.409937888198757
1233401,5,B00000JKNV,"Others have talked about the plot, so I will focus on other things. Such as the art. The art style has changed once again, but for the better. The colors are bright and solid where need be, and dark and brooding at the right times. The motions the characters make really look lifelike, as do some of the people, especially Haruna and Tenchi. And the dialogue is wonderful--not really as sappy as you think, but that made it even more moving. Love is expressed here in the simple ways of real people; meeting for lunch, or going shopping, or just spending an evening together. Tenchi doesn't save her from a world-dominating madman or a monster or an alien bent on revenge. And she acts a lot more human than many anime women I've seen. She seduces Tenchi whenever she feels his mind is wandering away from her and her world, and also is not above using her tears to get him to swing back over to her. She is excited to get the ring, jealous over the appearances of Ryoko and Ayeka, and becomes angry and vengeful when the two rescuers of Tenchi dare invade her world. She loves, she hates, she's petty at times, and that makes me love this movie even more. It's a fresh change from characters that show no emotion (though they have their place too) and characters that are consistently happy or sad or angry or whatever.
The tone of this movie is darker, but that is because it is necessary. Tenchi is aged quite a bit by Haruna, and so he is no longer acting like a clumsy teenager, but a mature young man. Haruna is a vengeful (wouldn't you like to know), and her methods show that. Yosho shows his wisdom and judgment, and even Ryoko and Ayeka grow up a little and actually become friends.
I loved this movie, especially since the tv series got a little too goofy for my tastes sometimes. My favorite dvd of all time is the Rurouni Kenshin/Samurai X OVA Trust and betrayal, and I think that influenced my feelings a bit. I just go for the dramatic, makes-you-cry-at-the-end films.
Anyway, I recommend this to any fan of the more mature, thought-provoking anime. And any Tenchi fan.",1080086400,,2084,4.4868421052631575
1233402,2,B00000JKNV,"Im not the Anime Fan I used to be. In fact, I haven't read a manga or watched one for a few years now (mainly because of what an ***expensive*** addiction it is). For some reason, I decided to watch all three in order again (these were the first DVD's I ever Had!) to pass the time. The first two were light, funny, and silly movies, which I enjoyed very much. Then I got to the third one, which was actually my former favorite movie, and I really saw what people had been dissapointed in in this film! The whole mood of the story was very dramatic and depressing! This is NOTHING like the usual Tenchi Fun and Laugther! Although I did laugh a couple times during this movie, it was sad to see Tenchi this way, ending on such a sour note! I'd really wish they'd make a fourth one, OLD-Tenchi style to end it RIGHT!",1060473600,,814,4.191082802547771
1233403,5,B00000JKNV,"This is the third Tenchi movie and the second one in the ""Tenchi Universe"" continuity.  The movie starts out as a standard Tenchi fare with Ayeka and Ryoko fighting over a broom.  They rush to Tenchi to resolve the dispute which he is loathe to do.  Finally, Ayeka has had enough and demands Tenchi choose between herself and Ryoko -- which girl does he want to be with?  Tenchi doesn't want to hurt either girl so he distracts them and runs off into the woods where he disappears into a tree.
Six months later, Tenchi is still missing and everyone is searching.  Sasami returns to Jurai to use their network.  Washu uses her vast scientific knowledge and resources, enlisting Kiyone and Mihoshi to assist her.  Finally, Ryoko and Ayeka put aside their differences and head to Tokyo where Washu has determined Tenchi to be.
While this starts as a standard Tenchi fare, this quickly turns into a serious tale of maturity, love, and loss.  People who enjoyed the various Tenchi sagas for their humor may be put off by this movie.  However, if you can accept this as a serious story, it is a very good one.  Watching all of the girls in the Masaki household putting everything aside for Tenchi is very touching, especially when it comes to Ayeka and Ryoko working well together.
As I mention in my title, Tenchi does choose between the girls, but not in a way that some might expect. Personally, I think Tenchi made his choice in the ""Tenchi Universe"" series.  As we are shown Tenchi's new life where he can't remember his past, one girl continues to come to his mind.  He draws her and paints her though he doesn't remember her.  As to the girls, one conceeds defeat in order to save Tenchi while the other takes one more chance to rescue Tenchi despite the danger not to mention apparently being rejected earlier.
Bottom line:  As a story, this one is truely a good one.  The standard complaints against Pioneer's subtitles (translations & readability) still stand and the extras are nothing to write home about.  Fans of good romantic stories will enjoy this as will most Tenchi fans.  Anime fans should also appreciate this title.",1052092800,,2131,4.6550802139037435
1233404,3,B00000JKNV,"This movie was average, so I gave it three stars.  I absolutely loved Tenchi Muyo!, Tenchi Universe and the first movie.  Tenchi Forever, on the other hand, disappointed me.  I felt this movie was a little boring, predictable and nothing new to the Tenchi community.  And you should really follow the R rating....",1047168000,,313,4.849056603773585
1233405,5,B00000JKNV,"nway, the title kinda seems funny, u'll see after you're half way through the movie.  Basically Yosho's former lover Haruna, lol, seduced tenchi into this tree of hers and created an illusion world to keep tenchi there with her in order to finish her dream with yosho. well, yosho kinda ran off with her from jurai, but haruna got sick during the journey and died.  It's kinda like...personally i think, she's taking revenge for the fact that yosho married someone else after the whole vow he took saying he'd love her forever and stuff.
I think it's pretty good, but the theme's really different from the first 2 tenchi movies, pure romance, the music's great if you like those slow romantic ones, the ending's really sweet, lol, the question is, is it just me or ayeka kinda admit at the end she gave up on tenchi...lol, u'll see wha i'm talking about after u've seen the movie.",1046649600,4,880,4.598726114649682
1233406,5,B00000JKNV,"I'll start out by stating that I'm not much of a Tenchi Muyo fan. Maybe that's why I enjoyed this movie so much, since it's so different that the TV series or the first two films. This one though, tells a creative and seductive story so provacative and goregeous you'll feel like you're watching a Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise movie. This movie honestly reminded me more of Eyes Wide Shut than it did any other Tenchi I've seen. The only flaw in the film is likely the attempt to explain all the happenings (A la Washu's insane rambling) with some sort of futuristic science. It kills a bit of the mystery of the events and it replaces it with inane illogical words. Many movies fall victim to this same thing, but this one is able to avoid it becoming a huge issue. The main plotline involves and old flame of one of Tenchi's ancestors, who is lonely and takes Tenchi in his place. Tenchi loses all of his memories of Aeka and Ryoko (and the rest of the gang). Filled with turns and twists, Tenchi Forever takes you for a wild ride.",1039651200,,1033,4.357512953367876

This is Tenchi?
This is not Tenchi.
Practically everyone is written horribly out of character ... When it comes to characterization, the only bright spot is the friendship between Ayeka and Ryoko...
Anime fans, avoid this movie.  Tenchi fans, avoid this movie even harder...",1033344000,3,279,5.2
1233408,4,B00000JKNV,I think this movie was great compared to what others have said about it. For one thing about the nudity it wasn't as bad as ppl made it out to be. The way they did it was very classy and you really don't see nothing except for one scene you see Haruna's chest and that's it. Also this Tenchi movie deals more with the characters instead of the comdey and action we are used to. You a different side of Ryoko more softer and your used to Ayeka being hysterical as usual lol.  You can figure out pretty much who Tenchi really thinks about all the time. What's so funny about it I don't think he realizes it either lol. Of course they try to make Haruna out to be a ... which she isn't just a person who was deprived of something a long time ago. Not saying that justified what she did which I still agree with Washu why didn't she just take grandpa instead. I mean even if he was old you would think she would love him no matter what but I guess that shows how superficial she is. Anyway I think this is good and you should at least rent if not buy it and judge it for youself.,1033171200,,1075,4.0233644859813085
1233409,5,B00000JKNV,"This is not your typical Tenchi movie. For starters, it's not humorous at all and there is really zero action. There are moments of levity, but the tone is much more morose and brooding with the overall theme being dealing with loss. The character design is more the Tenchi in Tokyo style (but better than that abomination) than resembling Universe or the OVA like the first two movies. It's a little distracting at first, but I suppose necessary to portray Tenchi as he is drawn for most of the movie. The animation is, however, top notch. This is the most adult of anything done of Tenchi stuff too. There's always been a very prevalent sexual humor throughout the series but it has never been portrayed on screen. No, it's not hentai and is done very tastefully, and within the context of the movie is very fitting. Nothing you wouldn't see on daytime soap operas.
This is the most character driven of all the movies as well. It really explores the relationship of Ryoko and Ayeka. My personal favorite sequence is where they are sleeping and Ayeka wakes up from a nightmare and starts talking to Ryoko about what if Tenchi really never comes back. It ends with Ayeka saying, ""You're so strong"" and Ryoko replying, ""Don't be stupid."" To me, it just shows how deeply they care for each other, despite all the fighting in the past. With all the (much deserved) hate towards Ayeka, it really portrays her in a positive light and gives the character some positive qualities not previously seen before.
Avoiding a spoiler, my only complaint is how Yosho's past has again caused the problem, and how it isn't exactly faithful to any of the Tenchi worlds in their explanation of events. You have to watch it to understand what I am talking about because to explain it any more would be giving away one of the more important plot elements.

This weak plot could of course be saved if it came with Tenchi's standard fight scenes and jokes but these are replaced with a love story that does not entertain. Overall this is even more disapointing then Tenchi in Tokyo, hopefully the new Galaxy Police TV show and 3rd Tenchi OAV will be more entertaining.

THE BAD-  The Tenchi Muyo shows, movies, & comics always have somthing for everyone: Comedy, Romance, action & the aspects of life. I must say, ""Tenchi Forever"" only focused on drama. The cast was also WAY out of character; Besides, Washu, Sasami, Kiyone & Mihoshi..who barely had parts at all.
THE GOOD- Basically, the story was very good. It answered a few of the ""Tenchi Universe"" questions that were never answered in the show. Plus, Haruna was a very complex character. She had a sweet-but-seductive side that we don't normally see in the series. & I'm glad she was only in the movie. Even though this movie was not as hilarious as the other Tenchi things, there was some comic-relief that broke through the drama.
OVERALL- This movie lost its Tenchi-ways after the first five minutes. I don't plan on watching this tomarrow or the next day. If I see this movie again it will be because I'm in a dramatic mood.

I mean you can't totally hate a tenchi movie but I really didn't like this one.  Just go buy the other movies on DVD and if you really like Tenchi get this one on VHS.
Wait... Well this one is funny to listen to in japanese so go ahead and buy it... Never Mind. Don't listen to me this was just my idea of the movie... -^_^-",1026000000,,687,4.051470588235294
1233455,4,B00000JKNV,There is an obvious lack of good fight scenes between the girls accept for the beginning. The movie is tied to the universe series but gives an actual reason for Yosho's disappearance. The stroyline builds on a few blind spots in the universe series but all in all it just does not have that tenshi feel. Perhaps that is why during the credits you see scenes from the universe series to remind you oh ya it is tenchi...kinda. As a stand alone movie it works well the stroyline and everything else was good but I just did not feel like I was watching tenchi after the first 5 minutes.,1025568000,,583,4.3577981651376145
1233456,3,B00000JKNV,"The first thing that I thought to myself as I started this movie was ""is this Tenchi?"" Tenchi is known for it's humor, action, and non-stop risque remarks, and that's what I had expected when I got this film. What I had found was a love story, a bit disturbing, a bit other-world like, but in the end worth the time of watching. Tenchi is taken to a parallel world by a strange woman called Haruna. She is not a goddess, nor a sorceress, and never shows any signs of special magic power (except for her ability to form an alternate world). She is just like Ryoko or Ayeka in most aspects, which makes it a bit more competitive. Ryoko and Ayeka also are on different grounds in this movie, ditching their previous rivalry so they can team up in search of Tenchi. Instead of the final confrontation between Ryoko, Ayeka, and Haruna being a big epic battle over Tenchi like always, there is no fighting or bloodshed and their hearts do the battling. This movie has a strange feel about it, using bizarre angles and shady lighting. The music is unique, using pianos and accordians in an Italian romance style instead of the sugar-coated, hyper j-pop which was used in the previous Tenchi movies and most other animes. The movie does a fair amount of suffuring at the end, ending too soon and making a PAINFULLY obvious point at who Tenchi really is in love with. While not as stellar as previous Tenchi movies, this film stacks up and is worth a view.",1022976000,,1447,4.484848484848484
1233457,5,B00000JKNV,"... i think it's the best Tenchi movie so far... Like when when Tenchi has sex with another girl in the movie it's realley not a big deal in the movie... Some of the characters hardly play in the movie.
In the beginning of the movie it starts off at Tenchi's home and as usual Ryoko and Ayeka start fighting, but over broom. Then Tenchi comes to stop it, but then they have him chose between them who he wants. Then Tenchi distracts them and run like hell up the stairs. But when he got to the forest he disappeared.  Now it's been six months since Tenchi disappeared and Ryoko and Ayeka are still looking for him. Then they get to Tokyo find him but with another women named Haruna, and every time they see him and try to catch him they lose him. Thats i am going to tell you cause I'm not spoil the movie.
I really think this is a great movie. Also think this is a good movie for Tenchi And Ryoko fans and also Ayeka fans too. But out of this whole Review all i'm trying to say is BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!",1021593600,,1002,4.086294416243655
1233458,5,B00000JKNV,"well, here is some advice for some of you die hard tenchi muyo fans,this movie is tottaly different than tenchi muyo in love(the first movie) and the daughter of darkness( the second) for two reasons,the first two movies had two things in common: comedy and action,tenchi forever does not have any action and hardly any comedy,it is a very dramatic love story. It does have superb animation and an awesome storyline but if you like comedy and action watch the first two movies,they're awesome as well. Oh there is something that tenchi forever has that the first two don't have much of,it has a few nudity scenes,i mean i know all anime has some nudity here and there but this a little more adult aimed nudity,its not too awful though,its not very detailed at all. But,i reccomend this movie to anyone over i would say 14 it is an awesome movie.",1020297600,2,845,4.602649006622516

1233460,5,B00000JKNV,"This is one of my favorite anime movies of all time. I got it Christmas morning and smiled. ""Yea! Another good, funny Tenchi movie!"" I was wrong about two things, 1: It isn't the funny sort of anime movie. 2. It isn't just another Tenchi movie. This movie is a beautiful love story between an older Tenchi and a girl named Haruna. Tenchi has no knowledge of Ryoko and Aeka. At all.
Well, except......no.....not giving things away. The ending of the movie is extremely beautiful. and let's just say this movie is perfect for nekoshippers (Tenchi/Ryoko, yeaaa). ^-^
In conclusion..........I give this flick 5 thumbs up! Yay!",1010188800,4,622,4.822429906542056
1233471,5,B00000JKNV,"Tenchi Muyo, what is it? It is the series that always keeps you guessing because you never know what's next. And this film is no exception. The Tenchi series is sometimes a sci-fi adventure, sometimes comedy, other times martial arts action, and sometimes a soapy daytime drama. This lastest endeavour falls squarely into the last catagory of a daytime drama, but not in any derogatory sense. I have seen some very wonderful romance stories on daytime dramas, but daytime dramas suffer from fundamental problems - very long and fractured stories - that ""Tenchi Forever""/TMIL2 does not. The story here is told completely and proceeds at an even pace, much slower than ""Daughter of Darkness"", with time for the viewer to savor the emotion of each scene. The story is about three relationships: an old one, a current one, and a new one. The old relationship introduces us to Haruna, Yosho's old flame from his previous life on Planet Jurai. She turns out to the villain in this film, but Haruna is very unlike any previous Tenchi villian. She is not some great ogre, but a likeable, very human person. This is a common device used in daytime dramas - to give the villian redeeming human qualities to keep the viewers guessing about how she turns out in the end (you won't find out from me!). In the new relationship Haruna has drawn Tenchi into her own private world where he cannot recall any of his previous life. This part of the story is exceptionally well done. Theirs is a mature relationship, it has love and romance of course, but unlike Achika and Nobyuki's storybook romance, Tenchi and Haruna also experience anxiety, tension, and conflict. It is surprisingly real and lifelike. The third relationship is the ""friendship"" between Aeka and Ryoko. It starts out as usual with a fight which causes Tenchi to just want to get away from them. When he doesn't come back (Haruna has taken him) they proceed to search for him together, with a little help from the remaining Tenchi cast. After searching for six months with no luck, Ryoko and Aeka begin to deal with their separation from Tenchi in very different ways. They begin to open up to each other and share their feelings in a way never seen before in Tenchi Muyo. Any Tenchi fan is sure to enjoy seeing Ryoko and Aeka trust each other and become real friends. This film is very different from both TMIL and DOD, even the animation production itself looks more like ""Grave of the Fireflies"" than either of the previous Tenchi films making this probably the oddest collection of movies I have ever viewed. I can't wait to see what the next Tenchi movie is like, to see if AIC can produce another film completely different from the three we have now.",1006819200,6,2706,4.698947368421052
1233472,3,B00000JKNV,"First of all I must say that every Tenchi animated feature, be it TV series, OAV or movie is a work of art, the characters, backgrounds, colors and motions are fantastic.
However the sound wasn't all that great for this movie, and let's face it - it is a little depressing to see how hung up on one guy both Ryouko and Ayeka are.
I know that if you fall in love, you fall in love and that is that, but they are depicted so pathetically in this movie it is just sad. Tenchi disappears and they search frantically, fight amongst themselves (which they always do) and are generally worthless.
This third movie in the series does definitely move in a different direction than previous movies. No Star-Wars-Like combat here. Art and feelings and different ideas of reality sure but not a whole lot of what has come to be known as typical Tenchi action. A part of what I really love about the Tenchi series is the comedy and the great action scenes - and taking a lot of it away doesn't really work for me.
It is great that the directors and artists are trying new things, but I think we get a little too much of the other side of Tenchi Muyo in this movie. But rate it as you will, it is still a Tenchi movie, and still worth a watch. You may not want to own it, but I would recommend at least seeing it.",1006560000,,1299,4.2
1233473,5,B00000JKNV,This was a amazing movie. Though i do think there wasn't enough action the plot was very interesting cause it is rare to see anime focusing on normal everyday life. The character development is very good as even Ryoko and Ayeka act civilised and get on well in this movie. The animation is different more adult than the other movies. I really liked the ending but i wish he wold tell her how he feels. The end song was very good though it would be better subtitled. I would strongly reccomend you watch Tenchi Universe as the story carries on from that.,1005696000,,553,4.431372549019608

1233477,4,B00000JKNV,"I purchased this one about a year ago. The first time I saw it, I felt it was barely OK. Since then My Tenchi Muyo! collection has grown considerably. (I have a lot of goodies you need to go to Japan to get.) Well I popped this one in the ol'Pioneer and discovered a rather good show. I didn't miss anything the first time I watched it a year ago, I just have a deeper appreciation for it. (Tenchi Muyo! in Love 2) Tenchi Forever is a more serious show than the previous stuff. Pioneer rates the movie for sixteen and up. Some people have alluded that there is a lot of nudity. That is a lie. I suspect that they have seen only edited versions of the OVA and the two TV shows or they have only seen the first two movies. As I said this is rated for 16 and up. I feel it is mostly for adult situations. (There is a difference.) For this film to be enjoyed properly, You pretty much need to see the first TV series (Tenchi Universe). The character development is based on that version of the Tenchi ""universe"". This film can stand on its own but knowing the characters helps. Stylistically this is different from the previous offerings in most ways, from artwork to music. (Actually the music is quite interesting.) The acting is OK in the English version but the Japanese version is fabulous.  Get it, enjoy it. Be careful of your comparisons. This will probably be the last Tenchi movie based on the first TV series. The next Tenchi movie will probably be based on the complete OVA, (""Tenchi Muyo! Rio Oki 3""),or the new OVA/TV series,(""Tenchi Muyo! GXP""). These shows are scheduled to be out in Japan, spring 2002. One last thing. I thought that it was interesting that they used a plot device from the Tenchi Muyo! OVA as the basis for this movie's story. Of course, you should try to figure it out without checking. If you just don't know, try watching OVA episode 9 ""Sasami to Tsunami"". Tanoshimu! (Enjoy)",995932800,5,1909,4.407932011331445

With clear detail of Haruna (who plays Tenchi's wife) nude. Not exactly what I was expecting. Anyways, the story is Tenchi leaves for a walk in the forest when Ayeka and Ryoko force him to choose between them and he somehow gets into another world - Haruna's world. Tenchi doesn't remember his other life and the girls begin their search for Tenchi. What's the relationship between Yosho and Haruna? Will they be able to get Tenchi back?

1233491,5,B00000JKNV,"""Tenchi Forever"" is exactly what a Tenchi movie should be.  Each of the three anime series all feature a splendid mixture of clever dialogue, slapstick comedy, involving storylines, and most of all, well-developed characters.  The last of these is the focus of ""Tenchi Forever,"" more than in either ""Tenchi Muyo in Love"" or ""Daughter of Darkness"".  While both of these are great movies in their own right, it is only in ""Forever"" that character drives the plot, giving us an extremely intense look into the four characters around which the Tenchi Universe revolves - To wit, Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, and Katsuhito.
In fact, one might go so far as to say that ""Tenchi Forever"" is really about the interesting relationship between Ryoko and Ayeka, the two women who are engaged in an interminable battle for Tenchi's affections.  Taking off from their love/hate relationship in ""Tenchi Universe,"" in ""Forever,"" we see two women whose fight over Tenchi has developed into a touching and interdependent friendship with each other.  Gone are the whiny Ayeka and overtly aggressive Ryoko - both have become strong-willed, independent, and assertive women.  This is the result of great writing and a great story.
""Tenchi Forever"" begins in true Tenchi fashion with Ryoko and Ayeka fighting over Tenchi, and demanding that he make a choice between them.  Trying to avoid the normal confrontation, Tenchi flees to the Masaki shrine, where an image of Haruna entrances Tenchi, and leading him into another dimension.  Ayeka and Ryoko move to Tokyo, where they are prime agents in the search for Tenchi.  Unlike the other Tenchi movies and series, in ""Forever,"" the supporting cast is just that - the roles of Washu, Nobuyuki, Kiyone, Mihoshi, and Sasami are extremely limited and are each dedicated to assisting Ryoko and Ayeka's efforts.
The subtext of the movie involves Katsuhito, Tenchi's grandfather - can he reconcile himself with his past?  What is his involvement in Tenchi's disappearance?  Why has Haruna taken Tenchi?  With Washu's genius, the technology of Jurai, and the industry of Ryoko and Ayeka, are the pooled resources of Tenchi's family enough to bring him home and to himself?
The animation style of ""Forever"" is slightly different from any of the series, a kind of blend between the classic Muyo/Universe and the more distinct ""Tokyo"".  It is fitting, though, since this is a different kind of movie - the characters are drawn and animated more like actual people, rather than as cartoon characters.  With a more adult-oriented storyline, it is entirely appropriate that the animation be altered to match.  The movie's musical score reflects this shift also, largely piano driven, evoking a kind of film-noir feel throughout the picture.  ""Tenchi Forever"" moves slowly, it is true, which may disconcert some, but for the true Tenchi fan, it is a brilliant end to the adventures of Tenchi, if it is indeed the end...",991872000,8,2924,5.073068893528184

The movie starts out like any other episode but 10 minutes into the movie you will soon see its a lot more then that.  It has a very good story line, that I won't reveal.  Since this movie is the last of the saga, we find out which of the six women Tenchi truly loves (you should know if you fallow Tenchi). The ending did leave me wondering how and where this relationship will end up, but with a good clean imagination you can pick up were they left off.

Well the new ""Tenchi in Love Movie"" is different to say the least.  Many fans of this series that I know didn't really enjoy this movie as much as I when I recently purchased it on DVD.  It's a little more grown-up in more ways than one.

When I first saw it I was alittle shy to what was going on it starts off with a great amount of mystery to first time views and a little taste of the unknown to fans. I think I picked up on the Tenchi series at Tenchi in Tokyo which is a very haunting series. This movie can't be explained one way, but maybe if you take your chance on me your can see it my way for a glance, it starts off as any other Tenchi show Tenchi is minding this own business just feeling the beauty of life and ryoko and akiea, forgive my spelling ask her for the last time who is he really wants to be with, Tenchi knowing he couldn't answer this question, dashes away while the two are distracted. He runs till he is winded then stumbles upon a tree and hears a soothing voice call him and sees a loving lady somewhere in the tree calling him and he ventures in and then Tenchi is gone...the movie pretty much is an adventure to recover Tenchi and make him realize his true feelings for that certain someone. the movie shows great emotion in the animation and in the most touching music I've ever heard even know it echoes in me. If you take the time and if your someone just know trying to understand love maybe this movie is for you I think I lied I don't really know how to make you see this movie the way I do it' something I've never felt before maybe you'll feel it too, well thanks for reading this.

1233496,5,B00000JKNV,"Though what I'm about to say is pretty much a cliche, I feel I must say it.  Tenchi Muyo in Love 2 is the best of the lot.  Needless to say this movie lacks the comedic and action styles that we have come to know about Tenchi.  I think we're better off in this case.  After watching this movie for the first time, I was overcome with a feeling of emotion that no other anime movie (or live-action for that matter) has been able to instill in me.
To reinforce the emotional and dramatic tones, the music is a great accompanyment to the movie.  In fact I enjoyed it very much to the point that I bought a copy of the soundtrack (e-mail me if you wish to know the site).  The piano in concordance with traditional Japanese style music is a great combonation.  It has the ability to stir thought into the viewers.
In short, I highly recommend this movie to all fans of anime.  I know I will treasure it forever.",985219200,,907,4.202312138728324
1233497,4,B00000JKNV,"If somehow you managed not to ruin the plot for yourself by reading the previous reviews, I'll try to avoid doing so for you.

Though this movie was developed as a conclusion to the Tenchi Universe series, and is considered by many to be the end of the Tenchi Muyo series, it does leave things ""hanging"" enough that the series can nonetheless continue.  There are also some relatively confirmed rumors that a third OVA series is being developed, although that may not be related on the same timeline as this movie.

I really liked this movie.  It had all the trapping of a good and involving story, and made use of the personalities of all of the characters of Tenchi's unusual family.  It's important to note here that this movie explores the real ramifications of the relationship between Ryoko, Aeka, and Tenchi and so most of the character development you will see is there.  By the end of your movie you will know who Tenchi is most in love with, perhaps even better than Tenchi himself.

For those interested in the technical aspects, the musical score, animation, and english voice dubbling left nothing wanting, they all were quite excellent.  I will note here for those interested in anime movie music that the musical score largely favors piano which is more suited to a more sentimental tale, like in the first Tenchi movie.  Being a movie, the animation quality is higher than any of the individual Tenchi episodes.  You will notice that the characters are drawn differently, but when those characters were brought into motion I was not alienated by their appearance.  I rather liked this look as it seemed to bring them a little more alive.

For Tenchi Fans, this movie will either be good or bad depending on what you expect.  There are none of the elaborate fight scenes seen in earlier Tenchi series and movies, and humor while noticeably part of the movie was not the emphasis of the movie.  Most of the focus on this movie is in the personalities of the characters.  There is quite a bit more adult content than any of the previous movies.  This includes some upper body female nudity (, which is nothing new for Tenchi,) and implied intercourse (a first in the Tenchi series).  I think this was tastefully done enough that I do not consider this truly pornographic, but parents should be advised you will want to review this first.  Because of these reasons I think that this is a movie that the more mature Tenchi viewers will enjoy the most.

I certainly enjoyed this movie, it was even good enough to make me want to go back and watch it again after the first time I finished it.  That is as much as I could ask of any movie.",982972800,12,2647,4.591489361702128

The music fit the story well and was beautiful in it's own right.  I think I'd love to have the soundtrack.  The animation was slightly different from the series and the first Tenchi in Love movie that I had seen, but I will admit I liked the way Tenchi was drawn. If you're used to the voices from the dubs, I suggest watching the subtitled version, the voices are less annoying.  All together it was a good movie.

1233523,1,B00000JKNV,"Even though I didn't expect much from this movie, (I had read some scathing reviews before buying) I still was very dissapointed. They used the same plot device from the previous movie. Some girl from Yosho's past just trying to get revenge through Tenchi.  Some other problems include the fact that Tenchi actually has sex with another woman. Not like the pure hearted Tenchi from all the other episodes.  The animation is not like any of the other series. The characters don't look nearly as good as in the previous movies. This movie lacks the humor that is common to the tenchi series. It also lacks the action as is common to the previous movies.  The only reason to buy this movie is if you want to complete your Tenchi collection. Otherwise don't bother.  I am just thankful there will be a continuation to the Tenchi Muyo OVA. This would have been a terrible way for Tenchi to go out.",980294400,5,892,4.55625
1233524,5,B00000JKNV,"I've heard that this is the final chapter to the Tenchi Muyo! saga I cherish so deeply... and then I heard that there's another OAV series in the making, which practically made me do cartwheels. Either way, I guess that's irrelevant since I'm reviewing this movie... but let it be known I'm VERY happy about learning this. Anyways, since everyone's already given the whole story away, I guess I'll do the same, heh. At the beginning of the film, Tenchi and the gang are sweeping at the Masaki shrine, and, as usual, Ryoko and Ayeka start fighting... this time, about a broom. They continue to argue until they want to settle it once and for all: they demand to know who Tenchi really loves. Tenchi does the sensible thing: he runs like hell. After taking off faster than Michael Johnson at the Olympics, he runs up to a tree that pulls him in... and he completely disappears. Next thing you know, it's six months later, and Tenchi's still missing. Tenchi isn't really missing though, he's in another world, a fantasy world, if you will. Difference being, he's older... and with another woman, Haruna, who created this alternate world. Ryoko and Ayeka are still looking for him all this time, and when they finally do see him (thanks to Washu and her Tenchi-tracker), he doesn't see them, he doesn't hear them, and he disappears yet again... and again and again. After this happens a few times, Tenchi goes into the little diner the two are working at (!), and he sits with his mystery woman at a booth. Ryoko and Ayeka still can't get to him though, even when Ryoko goes to grab him, her arms just go right through him. Of course, Haruna can see the two, and looks none too pleased about them, either. Ryoko and Ayeka learn from Washu, that the two worlds intertwine at times, due to Tenchi's lingering memory, allowing them to see him. With a little assist from Washu (and Kiyone, Mihoshi, and Tenchi's grandfather, Yosho [or whatever he's calling himself these days]), the two can go into that dimension allowing Tenchi to see them... of course, Haruna kidnapped and brainwased Tenchi in the first place, and it deosn't take a scientific genius like Washu to figure out she's not gonna to give him up so willingly. The story of Tenchi Forever: Tenchi The Movie III is as solid as a love story gets. In fact, it's THE best love story I have ever seen. I know what you're thinking: ""Wha?! A love story?! But this is Tenchi Muyo!, not Titanic!"" Oh, how very true, but unlike Titanic, you'll actually love this story, it's very heart-warming, sad, and beautiful all at the same time. What made the Tenchi Muyo! saga popular--the humor--is completely missing in this film. Even the fight scenes got as much time as the romace aspects in the Tenchi Muyo! saga... just not in this movie. I think the only time I laughed was when I saw Washu's devices to open up the parallel dimension for Ryoko an Ayeka, and even then, I didn't exactly roll in laughter (I chuckled). And guess what? There were no battles at all. The story is deeply rooted in romance, and honestly, I would not have wanted it any other way: the romance was why I loved this film so much. The character development in Tenchi Forever (Ryoko's, Ayeka's, Haruna's, and Tenchi's and his grandpa's, to be specific) shines with depth, personality, and lots of real emotion (they always have, but not quite like this). You REALLY feel sorry for Ryoko and Ayeka throughout this film. I hated Haruna at first: ""Hey... why'd she kidnap and brainwash the Tenchinator? Hey! She seduced Tenchi! HEY!!! She gave an evil grin to my Ryoko! Grrr!"" This, obviously, proves that she made one great villian... or was Haruna even a villian? No, she isn't really a villian at all. At the end of the film, you feel for Haruna as well, she's like all of us, in a way... she just doesn't want to be alone (something we all can relate to). The way she came about, through Yosho's past, was utterly brilliant. Even though her character only came out in this one film, she was very well constructed and held her own with the main characters. It just goes to show how beautifully written this story really is. When I think back on the story as a whole, it's actually pretty sad (not as sad as, say, Grave Of The Fireflies [which I admit to crying like a little girl after viewing], but sad nonetheless). The part were Ryoko goes back for me (err, I mean Tenchi, heh... sorry, wrong fantasy world there...) one last time was really touching. Okay... so what about the animation and dubbing, you ask? Well, the animation is beautiful. It's not as rich in detail as some of the other movie epics (Akira, Ghost In The Shell, etc.), but it's very colorful and looks just amazing. The rich backgrounds and vibrant colors really make this film come to life. The characters look a lot better here too compared to the previous Tenchi Muyo! stuff, which is always a nice bonus. The dubbing is absolutely flawless, not once did I think ""This is great, but it would be better if this character shut their mouth when the voice comes out right there"" like so many of us do to other anime titles (*cough-Sailor Moon-cough*). The voice actors aren't just actors, they really seem like they are their own character--why can't all anime dubbing be like this? *sigh* Thank Pioneer for actually caring about their products... they did one really amazing job here, folks. Even the film's soundtrack is amazing (a really nice change from the lame J-pop that usually accompanies anime), there's some very beautiful piano work to this film. Anyways, to sum it up, the animation is bright and colorful, top-notch stuff; and the dubbing is better than perfect. After watching Tenchi Forever: Tenchi The Movie III I came to one conclusion: this is the second best anime movie I have ever seen (first being Akira, which, let's face it, will never be topped). I honestly loved this movie that much. The story is beautiful and touching, I'm sure that will put off some people expecting humor and great action, which is one major loss for them... honestly, I have never seen a love story as half as good as this.

This movie does, but if does a round-a-bout way of going about it, so interpretation depends on that of the viewer.

Will she succeed or will Ryoko and Aieka stop her? You'll  have to buy the DVD to find out.  It's reasonably priced.  And everybody from the cast is here but in much smaller roles than usual (although Washu has a pretty good chunk of screen time).  The plot generally concentrates on Aieka, Ryoko and Tenchi.

1233538,1,B00000JKNV,"Tenchi the movie number three was one of the worst anime movies i have ever sat through. It went on and on until I actually wanted it to end. Please do not be offended if you liked the movie. This is my own personal opinion, and I am not one of those people that reviews a movie of a series I don't even like. I love the tenchi series.  The first movie was great.  A credit to the series the third however was not. The animation quality is poor,and there is very little plot.  Here is the gist of the movie. It starts out with Ryoko and Ayeka fighting over Tenchi as usual.  But this time they look right at him and tell him to choose between them once and for all. Tenchi not wanting to answer runs off into the woods behind his house, and sees a flowering tree. He suddenly becomes mesmorized and walks into the tree. The spirit of his grandfathers old girlfriend lives in the tree. Her name is Haruna ,and she takes Tenchi into a parallel dimension so she can live with happily with him. When they find tenchi missing the girls go into action. Washu spends her time in her lab messing with data. Sasami goes to Jurai to use the Jurai network to find Tenchi. Kione and Mihoshi break into this science place. So Washu can use its computer system to balance out the parallel dimensions. That way Ryoko and Ayeka can go in and bring tenchi back.  Before this Ryokoand Ayeka are on the Tenchi hunt going from city to city looking for him. While all this is going on Tenchi (who looks older and uglier)is going to an art class in this dimension and living with Haruna who brainwashed him. So all they do is Tenchi paints a picture of her and then they have sex.  Not too disgusting but not anything we want to see.  Finally after an hour of boredom Washu confronts Tenchi's Grandfather about Haruna.  When Yosho(Tenchi's grandfather) first left Jurai he was eloping with Haruna, but she died on the journey to earth where they had intended to live together.  So he planted trees that reminded him of her. The main tree is the one tenchi walked into.  Anyway to the conclusion already. Ryoko is able to bring tenchi back. Haruna's spirit goes to rest, and Ryoko is the winner of tenchi's affections at last.  I was happy that Ryoko won because she is my favorite but I still think this was a  rotten ending to the series.  Haruna is annoying so you don't feel sympathy for her as I think we are supposed to feel. The movie takes too long to get to the point. If you are a die hard tenchi fan buy it but if you are new stay away.",978048000,2,2524,4.277310924369748
1233539,4,B00000JKNV,"Very well made animae as many others have stated except that this movie IS NOT where Tenchi makes a choice between Aeka and Ryoko.  I've seen the ending multiple times now (DVD version) and had subtitles on for extra insurance.  I've seen how the ending shows one thought but there is no direct ""I love you Ryoko/Aeka"" in any way.  The end will hint at who he thinks more of but that's pretty much it.  Hopefully this won't spoil much for ya.
Hopefully, a rumored new series or another movie style will answer the big Q.  Tenchi is catching on quite well here in America so maybe the best is yet to come :)
Overall I greatly enjoyed it.  What I like about Tenchi in genereal is that it's not just a humorous/slapstick show.  The series (all of them) have it all; romance, drama, great character development and fun.  Though as stated that this is a drama style movie, its well worth it.

I hear it's the last film, episode, anything in the Tenchi saga - which is a disappointment, being a huge Tenchi fan myself. But the folks at Pioneer really know how to go out with a bang - as Tenchi Muyo in Love 2 does NOT disappoint. I won't waste time and space with the plot: as much as I'd tell you, has already been mentioned. The movie skips on action and comedy and concentrates on romance, and finishing the development of the excellent characters, while adding another. This movie has a great ending that will most likely bring a tear to the eye of anyone with a pulse. What really plagues me is the fact that movie maniacs ignore these movies and only yammer about mainstream romances - such as Titanic or Gone With the Wind. Stuff like that. I'm not saying they're bad - but TMIL2 is a better romance! It gets passed up because it's not mainstream, which is very disturbing to me. If you're a fan of the Tenchi series, the action and comedy part or the romance part, you owe it to yourself to at least give this one a rent.",977788800,6,1111,4.270142180094787

1233542,5,B00000JKNV,"I got this movie when Tenchi Muyo was still fairly new to me, so I was expecting the usual Tenchi fare... Mihoshi napping around, Sasami and Ryo-Ohki's cuteness, Ayeka and Ryoko's constant bickering, Kiyone's frustration with life (and Mihoshi), and Washu's scientific experimenting.  Very little of that is in this particular movie.  Even the music was completely different from the previous two Tenchi movies.  I could very easily have been disappointed.  At the time I was a budding sci-fi and mecha otaku.  But I was not disappointed.  ""Tenchi Muyo In Love 2"" aka ""Tenchi Forever"", a drama before anything else, had me floored.  [Since then I have expanded my interests in my growing anime collection.]
The movie starts with Ayeka and Ryoko fighting - as usual - about Tenchi.  This familiar aspect of the entire world of Tenchi is put to the ultimate test in this movie...  Once Washu discovers where Tenchi disappeared to after storming off because of the fight, she sends Ayeka and Ryoko, together, to rescue him.
""Tenchi Forever"", despite its dramatic difference from everything else Tenchi, remains true to its heritage.  If you enjoy seeing the characters exploring a more serious and 'realistic' side of themselves, this movie should not disappoint.  It is not about 'who wins Tenchi', instead the root of both Ayeka's and Ryoko's affections for Tenchi have to find a way to work together to save Tenchi from his mysterious fate.
""Tenchi Muyo In Love"" brought us a great adventure;
""Tenchi Muyo: Manatsu No Eve"" brought us a light-hearted action adventure;
""Tenchi Muyo In Love 2"" gives us the chance to see just how deep our favorite characters can go.
If you are a Tenchi fan, by all means give this movie a try, be patient with it, and you will be rewarded with a great movie.  Even those not familiar with Tenchi can enjoy this movie, the animation and story are both brilliant.",977184000,,1893,4.862928348909658

This movie however, it doesn't matter.  The designs, animation and music are beautiful.  The Japanese dub, of which I always prefer is like a beautiful melody.
Then when you have watched it you realise, there were no fight scenes, no violence and that Tenchi is a mature, responsible person.  In the last movies, both of which I enjoyed, the characters were more popular with me than the regular characters, this is the same here.  In Tenchi Forever (Tenchi In Love 2), we are presented with a character that you not only grow to like, but pite as she lives in her own tragedy.  Also, it is a very good way to end the entire Tenchi Saga, if they do happen to make or plan anymore, never let them see the light of day.  As the title says, there is no need for Tenchi, not anymore at least.
Buy this movie and you will not regret it.  Also, the DVD can be snapped up at a nice low price, that makes it worth 10 stars, let alone 5.",975369600,2,1247,4.367965367965368

The quality of the animation is better than I'd hoped, and the 5.1 digital sound isn't bad either. From an objective standpoint, the DVD has 5.1 audio in both English and Japanese.

1233568,3,B00000JKNV,"I should preface this review by saying that I'm a huge fan of the Tenchi franchise; the OVA series, Tenchi Universe, Tenchi in Tokyo, and the two previous movies.  With this in mind, I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed with this movie.  Before you buy it, you should know that Tenchi Forever is very different from the other movies and series.  It lacks the humor and the action associated with the typical Tenchi product.  It's not funny, there's no big climactic battle at the end, and Ryoko and Ayeka don't fight over Tenchi.  For the most part, it's a very serious movie, and much more of a ""grown up"" movie than one would expect (and yes, Tenchi has sex in this one).
The movie begins with Tenchi mysteriously disappearing.  Flash forward six months later, Tenchi is still missing, and the girls have split up to search for him.  Much of the movie focuses on Ryoko and Ayeka in Tokyo looking for Tenchi.  The movie shows how the two lean on and support each other throughout this emotional ordeal.  They are now caring friends rather than rivals.  Ultimately they find Tenchi, who is somehow several years older and now has a mysterious girlfriend, Haruna, and they must find a way to pull him away from her.
It's not a bad movie, it's just very different from every other series and movie in the Tenchi franchise.  The movie is full of ""warm and fuzzy"" moments, especially at the end.  This makes Tenchi Forever more of a romantic drama than a comedic action movie like its predecessors.  Also, the animation is very different from the other movies.  It is similar to the animation in Tenchi in Tokyo but not as good (Just look at the cover).  Plus, Tenchi's got this weird hair cut through most of the movie.  It kinda bugs...  The music is also very different.  It's very mellow, heavy on piano and classic guitar.  It's actually pretty nice.  In fact, one of the better parts of the movie is the closing credits where music plays and a retrospective of the Tenchi Universe series is shown on the side.  It's nice, but the fact that the closing credits are one of the better parts says something about the movie.
For longtime Tenchi fans, the most important reason to watch this movie is to see the apparent end of the Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka love triangle.  Tenchi subtly reveals which of the two girls he is closer to, and in the end, the other girl acknowledges this bond and bows out (Although it would have been better if was more dramatic than it was...).
Like I said, this isn't a bad movie, but then again, it's not a great one, either.  If this is the end of the Tenchi saga, and by all indications it is, it sadly ends with a mild pop rather than with a bang.
I would recommend, especially to die-hard Tenchi fans, that you rent the movie before you buy it because there is a good chance you will not like this movie.",972259200,,2843,4.467054263565892
1233569,1,B00000JKNV,"First off, let me state this. I have never been a big fan of the Tenchi Universe(no, not the first TV series, but the collection of series as a whole. Hence, ""Universe""). However, I still know a good anime when I see one, and frankly, this one missed the boat by long shot.
Those who watched the Tenchi series of comedy or action(or both), I warn you now, the latter mentioned things rarely poke their heads out in this Movie(though to me, it really just feels like longer Tenchi episode). So if thats why you found it entertaining, you may want to rent\borrow from a friend before you lay down the cash for this one.
Most people say that the romance\WAFF(Warm And Fuzzy Feeling) content gets too much in the way of the plot. I don't think thats the case here at all. The problem is, its just not that interesting. The whole time I was watching it at a friends house, I found my attention driffting to other areas of the room. That right there is a bad sign.
That and some other stuff really makes me think this was a waste of celluloid:
The drawings(aka:What an eye sore!): The drawings seemed like they have always been decreasing since the end of the OAV. This is no execption. Some say its a different artistic experesion. Well, whatever it was, I don't like it.
The Pair(you know who I am talking about): I think my biggest turnoffs of this series(and this ""movie"") are still Ryoko and Ayeka. Though for the most part, their abusive-to-one-another behavior to eachother has been toned down, they are still there. They still bring back bad memories. They still agravate me.
The lack of supporting cast: The main reason that I liked some of the Universe was because of the supporting cast(i.e. Washu, Mihoshi, Kiyone etc.) Because of their lack of the non-stop infatuation with Tenchi, I became more tolerant of them then I did of ""the pair"". However, all of them really play a very small part in the film, and basically making them time filler. Yet another frustration.
And finally; the plot itself: With the lack of an interesting plot, the film became tiresome very quickly. Some people say give it some time. I watched it thru. I found nothing redeming about it at all. And worse yet, I can barely remember what the hell the plot was. That's not a good sign of good production. But since I have very little interest in the series in the first place, the balance of this review becomes lopsided(I am not trying to be bias, but rather look at this from an Otaku point of view.

You may look at me strange after hearing that this movie isn't regular Tenchi fare. Sure no one can forget the last episode of Universe. No one can forget Zero's scream of pain as she nearly kills Tenchi. But this movie erases all that. This movie is touching on all levels, emotional, phisycal, and in every other way possible.  NO ACTION IT DIDN""T NEED IT!  This movie is better than yes Akira, and yes Princess Mononoke the ""best anime movies ever"" well in my opinion Tenchi Forever is the most wonderful movie every. The story is almost like Tenchi in Love's story but it is much better.  The movie is made up up beautiful images that you'll never forget. THe soundtrack stays with you for days and you want it to.  I LOVE THIS MOVIE!",970876800,,904,4.732484076433121
1233572,5,B00000JKNV,"The first Tenchi Muyo movie gave audiences what they expected - action, fun, and fighting. Tenchi Muyo Forever, the third and last movie, breaks new ground and measures up to its predecessors without imitating them.
Rather than using the same formula as the first two, TMF explores the boundaries between love, happiness, and dreams in a similar style as the Urusei Yatsura movie Beautiful Dreamer. These themes are skillfully woven together into an engaging  story about Tenchi's loves.
Instead of big bad villains and epic battles, expect to find better development of all the TM characters. What brought Tenchi's grandfather to earth? Can love be real when love is blind? Who is Tenchi's true love and more importantly, why? These questions and more are answered satisfactorily and consistent with the rest of the TM series.
For traditional TM fans looking for action and general silliness, you'll see a lot less of it here. But don't let this discourage you from seeing this movie. The characters are all there and plenty of interesting things are happening. However, this movie does demand a little more thought to extract everything it has to offer. Subtlties abound within the movie, so pay close attention to catch everything.
Tenchi Muyo Forever aspires to and succeeds at being a film rather than just a movie. It successfully intertwines several love stories into a single drama. It is a very worthy finale to the Tenchi Muyo saga.
For all of the reasons stated above, I rate this film the best of the three TM movies, with 5 very solid stars.",969753600,14,1554,4.908745247148289

I thought that this was an excellent end to one of the best animes ever.",969494400,,368,4.228571428571429

I know that there are some people who did not think highly of  this movie, but, just like them, I have my own opinion.  I do not like how  some people push their opinions on others and say like, ""This movie  wasn't great, etc."" because everyone has their own opinion and I would  like to state that my opinion is that, I really enjoyed this movie quite a  lot.
The first part of the movie was great, how Tenchi got out of a fight  between Ryoko and Aeka, like always.  This movie truly portrays how people  sacrifice what they hold most dear, so that others might go on.  I do not  wish to say more than this because it might ruin some of the movie.
But  to conclude, I truly enjoyed this movie and how this movie interacted with  the series, on how Ryoko and Aeka fought for Tenchi.  You'll be surprised  what the ending has to offer...
This truly must be one of the best anime  movies, that I, in my opinion, have seen ever, and will ever see in my life  time.

But the character interaction was amazing. Plus  the background music helped set the mood. Along with great animation, great  dubbing, finding out who Tenchi really loves and Ryo-oh-ki's meowing makes  this video a great addition to the Tenchi series.

Watching Ryoko and Ayeka agonize first  over Tenchi's disappearance, then over the fact that he cannot see them,  and they cannot touch him... this time, they may have lost him forever.  You'll need to see it for yourself, if you can get it.

A nice plot, good voice acting, nice animation (Although Ryoko  looked kinda choppy), alot of emotion, and a ending theme that will always  make us remember the times we shared with Tenchi and the gang!  I will  not be showing this to my kids because of the nudity but when they're 15 or  16 then I'll let them see the ending to the show they (And I) loved!  Bravo!

1233589,3,B00000JKNV,"I have been looking all over for this movie after I saw the first two.  However, it didn't turn out as good as it's precedessors.  Tenchi Forever is a love story with a nice setting. The characters are full of emotions,  but the scenes are repetitive and the story is moving very slow. Overall,  the atmospere is pretty low key.  There were no ""actions"" (don't  expect any exciting fighting scenes) in the entire movie.  I think the  producers want to do something different since this is possibly the  conclusion; they are much more concentrate on character development.  The love battle between the two female characters finally draw to a nice  conclusion, which is good.  The draw back of the movie is the lacking  of humor (May be it is necessary for the character to grow up a bit), but  it's a little too boring.  The bottom line is ""even though Tenchi  Forever is not like the other Tenchi movie/TV, it is still a good story. I  would say it's above average. :)",960508800,,968,4.534883720930233
1233590,1,B00000JKNV,"I am a big fan of the Tenchi-Muyo OAV and TV series and well when I first saw this movie I was somewhat disappointed.  I rather like the battles and slap-stick humor - to me that was what made it so enjoyable.  I haven't  seen any of the Tenchi in Toyko series so I'm not sure if the animation is  the same in that series as the movie ... so to me the animation was a  distraction.  I was also disappointed with the fact that the other  characters (i.e. Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, Mihoshi, etc.) played very small parts  and if you had taken them out of the movie it wouldn't have made a  difference at all to the story.  To me the fun loving,  action/comedy/romance heart of Tenchi had been ripped out and replaced with  this lovey-dovey, sappy soap opera.  I was bored most of the time because  the story never seemed to go anywhere and it there were too many gaps (like  it took his father SIX MONTHS to file a missing persons report after his  disapperance). Though I will say that the story was beautiful and  interesting - it could have used more of the old Tenchi style to get a 5  star rating from me.  I am sad that this is the way the series ended.  So I  warn you out there who are like me - the ""old-style"" Tenchi-Muyo  fans - don't get this movie.",960163200,5,1251,4.168067226890757
1233591,1,B00000JKNV,"It's almost sad the way I watch some Tenchi fans cling onto this movie and try to artificially inflate it to be better then it is. It's gotten to the point that I've simply shaken my head in sadness at the way we accept such  a poorly done movie like this because we're Tenchi fans.
Why is it  accepted? Plain and simple: Ryoko won. And the vast majority of Tenchi fans  in the U.S. are Ryoko fans. 95% of the people who push this movie are Ryoko  fans. You'll rarely find an Aeka fan that likes this movie. Why? The  movie's director is an outright Aeka hater, who has said so directly  before. Unfortunately though, Aeka isn't too popular among the American fan  base, and therefore, we don't get to see a larger outcry against the movie.  I know all my friends who are Aeka fans were downright disgusted with how  this movie treated Aeka.
And the Ryoko fans cling onto this movie for  dear life to squeeze every last drop of anything out of this movie of  ""romance"" between her and Tenchi. This is not the entirety of the  Ryoko fan base, as like with the majority of viewers I know who see this  movie, the majority of them that I know hate this movie too. However, the  majority of fans of the movie stem from the same fan base. The romance, as  correctly pointed out by other reviewers, is a complete and utter farce,  taking up no more then four minutes of the movie, never dealing with  anything involving why the romance happens or aspects of it, and is a  meager subplot put in there to fool the viewing public into believing  something is there that isn't. These fans tend to pump up the movie, adding  in things that never happen, changing around scenes to fit their viewpoint,  and so on. It's rather sad the way that they want to win so badly that  they'll hang onto any scrap that is handed their way, however it is not  surprising.
Why else is this movie getting pumped up more then it  deserves? Because it's anime, that's why. And let's face it: many hardcore  anime fans like to pump up anime products and put them on a rating scale  that inflates their quality above what a similar live action film would be  rated. This is not to say that there aren't many good anime films out  there, as there definitely are, but you have to wonder when you look around  how seriously ratings should be taken when just about everything gets loads  of five star reviews. We all know from Hollywood that it's ridiculous to  believe that that many films and shows are five star quality.
And what  happens when you question these people? They cry that ""you're not a  real fan"" or similar type things. Well the fact is this is a rather  sad practice. Unfortunately, it does happen though, but still one should  not be afraid to question them.
As pointed out, the things trumpeted  about this movie are 9/10 times false and things twisted around to inflate  it. For instance, ""original plot"" is not true at all. It's an  original presentation as far as the Tenchi series goes, but the plot is as  stale as a twenty-year old T.V. dinner and has already been done at least  two times in the Tenchi series in various ways. ""Character  development"" is another thing that is not done well here. People  confuse ""great character development"" as ""making the movie  serious."" However, if you look carefully, you'll notice the character  development in the movie is extremely poor and almost non-existent and most  of the stuff that appears as character development is simply a change of  setting, like making Ryoko and Aeka friends. And as mentioned before, the  Ryoko/Tenchi romance is an absolute farce in the movie. Many people who  like the movie also tend to ignore Haruna, who was undoubtedly the main  character of the movie and by all means possible was a horridly done  character. There are reasons this character has become so widely hated. The  movie conveniently ignores much of what she does and attempts to sell her  as a sympathetic character, ignoring the fact that she outright raped  Tenchi. In fact, all the characters seem to not mind that tidbit either.  Apparently, the director hoped people wouldn't notice or didn't care, and  unfortunately a lot of people didn't notice, or don't care.
And as I  finish this review, I note that the movie simply didn't care about wrapping  up itself or the TV series. This is not the final Tenchi product, merely  the end of the involvement of Director Negishi. Only Pioneer U.S. pushed it  as the ""final Tenchi production."" The movie does not deal with TV  series 1 in any way, to the point where it doesn't even fit in that  universe and becomes yet another ""alternate Tenchi-verse."" The  movie doesn't even deal with itself, failing to conclude almost anything in  the movie. We never learn whom Tenchi cared for more, Haruna or Ryoko, as  she dies out prior to the point of Tenchi getting a chance to choose. We  never see why most of the movie played out as it did, as there is little  reasoning among many parts of the movie. There's just too much to, in any  way, classify this as a good movie. This was simply a bad production, poor  in nearly every way.",960076800,11,5112,4.537870472008781

1233593,5,B00000JKNV,"This is the true sequel to the first Tenchi movie, and like ""Tenchi Muyo in Love"", this is of a high standard indeed. The story centres around the sudden disappearence of Tenchi after another spat between Ryoko  and Ayeka, and all the girl's efforts in finding him afterwards. When they  do, they find Tenchi fully grown and in an adult relationship with a girl  named Haruna. But this is no ordinary relationship, as all concerned  eventually discover. Character designs have been canged slightly, with good  animation. Music is excellent, with the piano score and ending theme the  highlights. This has been declared as the last ever Tenchi production, so  all anime and tenchi fans, plus those looking for a good love story, should  give this one a go.

In Love 2: Haruka naru omoi contains many elements that would probably surprise an old school Tenchi fan. First off, this film places much more  emphasis on drama than previous Tenchi titles, and secondly, Tenchi Forever  has a much more grown-up feel to it. If seeing Tenchi in an adult situation  turns you off, this probably isn't the movie for you. Personally, I found  this film to be quite enjoyable. I was very surprised at how serious this  film was. There are times when the emotions played by the characters are so  realistic that you actually feel their pain, the producers of this film  truly did an excellent job reaching their audience. All in all, this is an  excellent film that just begs to be watched. If you are a fan of Tenchi  that doesn't mind a little diversion from the usual Tenchi antics, you owe  it to yourself to watch this film!",956275200,,932,4.429411764705883

First off, I am absoloutely positive that the same people who brought the OVA series to life keeled over and were replaced by high animators who had no idea  what the cast of Tenchi was supposed to look like!  Second, even though  the plot was semi-original many elements from the original Tenchi movie  were reused. (Aka Tenchi disappearing with everyone there to help/look for  him.) Haruna was okay, but I definetly could have done without the sex  scenes. C'mon! Tenchi is supposed to be this wholesome guy whose stuck with  all of these alien women and has the manners to accept them all for who  they are and not to lay a finger on them!  So...in conclusion, I advise  anyone considering buying this movie to purchase the first two Tenchi  movies before watching this one, so you can cleanse your mind of the memory  of this shotty end to a great series!",955929600,3,923,4.595092024539877

1233617,5,B00000JKNV,"One thing I've always loved about the Tenchi Muyo movies -- compared to many other anim&eacute; films -- is their ability to tell a coherent story,  with a beginning, middle, and end.
""Tenchi Forever"" is more  consistent in tone than the other Tenchi movies.  I agree with the other  reviewers that there is much less slapstick.  But that's OK:  Tenchi has  been around for a few years, and there's only so much Three Stooges humor  that can sustain a franchise.
Without spoiling the story, I'll say that  unlike some of the other movies, this one doesn't have an Evil Enemy.  It  is a more thoughtful investigation of how love leads to sadness, and pain.  The artwork is simply stunning.  I highly recommend it.
For DVD viewers,  the extras are rather sparse.  When are we going to see Anim&eacute; DVDs with  commentary tracks, that's what I'd like to know.  There is a short  interview with the musical composer that is interesting, but that's about  it for extras.",951264000,5,968,4.72289156626506

Two, no more slapstick comedy scenes involving Ayeka and Ryoko. Three, the animation style had  changed. However, i like this film a lot. The storyline in the movie is a  serious one, it's kinda like a drama. If there are slapstick comedy and  fighting scenes in it, it will spoil the mood. The lack of scenes for the  other girls are troubling too, but this movie actually focuses on the main  highlight of the original OVA, the Tenchi/Ryoko/Ayeka love triangle. So at  the end, it's still about Tenchi choosing the girl he really wanted. The  soundtrack is melodramatic, which is perfect for a movie like this.",949536000,6,731,4.6640625
1233619,5,B00000JKNV,"To begin with, I can sympathize with those that didn't like this film, since TMiL2 is not a typical Tenchi film.  The story takes place a full six months after Tenchi disappears; this means that all of the characters are  distraught and weary after months with no word from him.  This is not to  suggest that anybody acts strangely; every characterization is nailed  perfectly.  But suggesting that Ayeka and Ryoko should be bickering just  like their usual selves does a disservice to their love for Tenchi.  They're *worried*.  Tenchi's gone, and maybe for good.  The film spends  quite a bit of time exploring the characters of Ayeka and Ryoko, in fact,  at least partly because Tenchi implicitly chooses between them at the end  of the film.  Don't worry; no spoilers here, but remember:  every Tenchi  film and series exists in its own unique little timeline.  Don't worry  about whether this fits in with *your* choice for whom Tenchi should be  with.  And I haven't even talked about the artwork yet.  It's amazingly  beautiful.  I wanted to hang every single moment of this film on my wall.  This film is a work of art, and should be seen for that alone.

1233620,5,B00000JKNV,"I applaud the voice acting right off the bat.  Orikasa Ai (Ryoko) is quite probably one of the leading seiyuu in the industry, with the intensity and sense of character that far exceeds practically everyone within the North  American counterpart, and equalling that of Hayashibara Megumi (Nuku-Nuku)  or Kamiya Akira (Ryo Saeba from City Hunter).  With that said, the story is  kind of a twist for the series.  Minor comedy, and slight reparte done in  dimensional transition just provide foundation for a jaunt into a serious  vein.  The story itself was enrapturing, with a solid arc and conducive and  relative to the overall saga which had been portrayed within the first TV  series.  Any Tenchi fans will want this movie for their collection,  however, I recommend newcomers try and locate the Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-ohki  series or Tenchi Universe series to give a proper grounding.

1233621,2,B00000JKNV,"Before I go off on a rant, I have to say that if you've never seen the Tenchi Muyo OVA or the Tenchi Universe tv series- DON'T GO NEAR THIS. One has to be well immersed in the Tenchi universe to truly undrstand this  movie. Having said let's get on with the review.
First off, I noted that  the animation was ""different"". Nothing truley drastic, but all  the charachters had a rather distinct look to them, and that in itself  wasn't a bad thing, since the particular style complimented the serious  plotline. But the story itself is where the problem lay. Now, don't get me  wrong, I'm a Tenchi fan, but ANYBODY who gives this movie FIVE STARS has a  real objectivity problem. The first movie was extraordinary, the second a  good effort, but this, *THIS* is pointless meandering; nothing truley  develops and the whole movie drags ( and to those who accuse me of having  Ninja Scroll-itis, i.e. Dragon Ball Syndrome, let it be known I liked both  PATLABOR movies, which are very long and dry indeed ). The story revolves  around Tenchi being searched for by his friends and family which basically  take up the majority of the movie. Nothing REALLY happens during this time;  Sasami goes of to Jurai, Washu is on her computer ( of course ), and Kiyone  and Mihoshi head to the Science Academy to steal vital parts &  information for Tenchi's search . All these tasks seems to be more of a  gesture for the fans than anything, for all they really are is an excuse to  show off the series' many charchters. The real action ( if one can call it  that ) is with Ryoko and Akane's search in Tokyo, where they, inevitably,  become very emotional over Tenchi's dissapearance. In the meanwhile, Tenchi  is with Haruna, and nothing is really happening there either. I wouldn't  mind the lack of action and lack of comedy, but nothing EVER truley  develops. On the plus side the ending with Yosho is very cool ( ""don't  be jealous"" ) and the movie hints where Tenchi's heart might lay.  Unfortunatley, this little tidbit is marred by the movie's static plot and  equally sluggish pacing.",948326400,10,2078,4.578804347826087

But there is none, battle-wise at least. The story is  good and if you take it by itself and don't compare it to the rest of  Tenchi (any of it), it's actually very good. I do hope that AIC and Pioneer  do go through with plans to continue the OAV series (Perhaps with a 4th  movie instead of a 3rd OAV series) because I would have liked to see a bit  different of an ending (not just because I wanted *insert name of losing  girl* to win and get Tenchi). Still, this movie is a nice little viewing,  drags a little and the music CAN be overpowering, though I like the end  song. I suggest that Tenchi fans and fans of dramatic anime see this. If  you require some  battle action to go along with your anime story, don't  even touch this movie's box. Go with ""in Love"" or ""Manatsu  no Eve."" (Weeee Mayuka ;)",940118400,3,977,4.03125

1233637,4,B00000JKNV,"Well, it WAS a Tenchi Movie... just not what I was expecting. Being a Tenchi Otaku, i say It could have been better. As for who Tenchi chooses, it could have been more indepth. Yes, the music was great.
Final Summary:  Could have been MUCH better.",939600000,2,247,4.369565217391305
1233638,4,B00000JKNV,"A much more refined Tenchi movie, ""Tenchi Forever"" has won a place on my shelf through it's storytelling and revealing who Tenchi cares for more.
The score is emotional and conveys the varied feelings almost  perfectly.  There were moments that the music did overshadow the film, but  on a whole, it fit the picture very nicely.  I think that the  ""chase"" music fit the emotions of the girls on their hunt for  Tenchi very well.
The main ""Evil"" character is not evil at all,  and she only truly wants Tenchi to be happy.  And if that means taking him  away from the constant bickering of Ayeka and Ryoko, then so be it.
Over the course of the film, however, both the haughty princess and the  mischevious space pirate learn how to control their rivalry and even build  a friendship and team together.
If you are looking for the entire Tenchi  gang, then you'd be better of watching the first movie, as this one focuses  on Ryoko, Ayeka, and Tenchi.  The rest of the cast make small appearances,  but in no way comparable to the first two movies.
In the end, I feel that  the final scene shows Tenchi making his choice between the two women, whose  demand fr a decision is what started this whole problem in the first place.  And in my own opinion, he ends up with the better of the two.
There  are some subtle references to the first movie, and the way that they tie  together the TV series through clips during the credits is very well done.  I highly recommend this movie, especially for fans of the Tenchi series.  It's a well done piece of art.",939340800,,1548,4.434163701067615

7912355,4,B00000JKNV,"Its another day in the Masaki household, Ayeka and Ryoko are fighting and - Disgusted by it all again - Tenchi runs out of the house and into the woods behind the Masaki Shrine only to find an enormous - nearly dead - Tree. with a flash of light, Tenchi disappears.

for Six Months the joy has left the Girls' lives and little hope is to be had, untill, one day, while Ryoko and Ayeka are working at a family restaurant, Tenchi reappears, looking much older, with a new woman named Haruna on his arm, and with no memory of his life with Ryoko and the others.

and why does Yosho have a suspicion about what happened to Tenchi?

This movie, a direct sequel to the first film, compared to the 'Daughter of Darkness' movie, is set exclusively in the Universe cannon and is considered to be the finale of that storyline. the art is a bit different from the first film (and decidely much more realistic than the second) it also tugs on the heartstrings in many places, and with a couple of scenes can be decidedly shocking for anyone who's a fan of tenchi muyo! there are also unresolved plotlines that are mentioned and begun in this film, which are highlighted in the manga (and unless you read it, you wouldnt even know they're there) While the first film dealt with Tenchi's Mother, Achika, the damsel in distress this time around is definately Tenchi.",1365552000,,1351,4.483739837398374
7912356,4,B00000JKNV,"Following the adventures of Tenchi Masaki can be confusing.  There are a number of series, spinoffs, and movies that seem to go in many different directions.  The quality of the storylines and the animation vary widely, from Saturday-morning cartoon cheesy to inspiringly beautiful.  Though the characters are generally likable, there's a certain predictability to them that makes them two-dimensional.  So while Tenchi is a fairly popular title, there's a lot NOT to like, too.

  But, there are some bright spots, of which Tenchi in Love 2:  Tenchi Forever is definitely the brightest.  First, some of the minor characters play much less of a part in this story.  Kiyone, MiHoshi, and Sasami play such minor roles in the movie, you'd be hard pressed to think they were regulars in the series.  Washu is a bit more visible, but still slightly diminished.  These things actually help to move the story along.

  Of course, Ryoko and Ayeka are quite visible throughout, but there's a lot less sniping at each other.  In fact, they're quite genial towards each other at times, as they explore many dead-ends in locating Tenchi, who mysteriously vanished from the Masaki estate.  What they don't realize is that he is in an alternate reality in which his old life isn't even a memory.  He's a few years older, and happily living with Haruka, the love of his life.

  The tone of this movie is a marked departure from the loud and sometimes violent Tenchi that we saw in the Tenchi Universe series and the awful Tenchi Movie 2:  Daughter of Darkness.  Even the decent first movie `Tenchi in Love' used a lot of the familiar elements from the series.  But this movie is a radical departure, and the result is a film that is much more literate, mature, and touching than I'd expect from the Tenchi franchise.  (Be sure to watch the still frames as the credits roll for the answer to a very popular question!)

  Intimate knowledge of the characters is not absolutely necessary, but certainly will give you a better understanding of the movie.  If you haven't seen any of the series or movies, you might want to rent out `Tenchi in Love' first or catch up on the back-story of how Tenchi meets Ryoko and Ayeka (and the others) via some internet site.  `Tenchi Forever' will make it worth the effort.",1361404800,,2292,4.743654822335025
