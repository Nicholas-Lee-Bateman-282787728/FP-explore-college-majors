8011058,4,B0001E5U3W,"The movie involves a plot to take over the world with a bunch of guys that look like Lou Reed. If that doesn't make you want to watch this movie then what will? Seriously, Lou Reed world domination! A hero that looks like a daddy and has the body of a daddy too. A ton of Wild Bunch style slow mo shoot outs.

In all seriousness, it's a fun b-movie that worth tracking down. It's a shame that there aren't more movies like this out there. High on ambition even if it's not quite hitting it's mark.",1410393600,2,497,4.123711340206185
