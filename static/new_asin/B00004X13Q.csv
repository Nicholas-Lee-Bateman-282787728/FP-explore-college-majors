1367617,5,B00004X13Q,"This movie was touching, out there, and absolutly drop to the floor uncontroulable laughing, comedy about being ""a gay"" in a straight  world.  Although some things are over exajerated, like haveing a poster of  Malissa Ethride of her wall, it was very well done and a classic for all  times. It may not be for eveyone, but it was hit for me and I can't wait to  see it agin and enjoy the laughes all over.",966902400,2,405,4.276315789473684
1367618,5,B00004X13Q,"This movie was great.  Alot of people have said that it couldn't decide weather it was funny or serious but that's actually what makes it so  good--and a romantic comedy!
It gets laughs by exaggerating gay and  lesbian sterotypes (in a non-offensive way), making fun of those 'gay  rehab' places, at homophobia, and at itself.  There are also a lot of  ""inside jokes"" in there--pay attention!  (""raging  bulldyke"", ""it's time to wake mary"")!
The romantic part is  truly sweet and is in classic love/hate relationship format.  You walk out  just feeling happy!  :) This is the first movie that I've seen that doesn't  portray lesbians as either: man-hating super-butches, leather bound  kink-freaks, psychotic killers, or soft-core porn icons to please the  straight males in the crowd.  That's really important for all us young  lesbians who don't fall into one of those categories and it is a sign of  society's (or at least the film industry's) changing attitude towards  lesbainism!
That being said,this movie is for EVERYONE--highly enjoyable  for all.  My (straight as an arrow, happily married) mother went with me  and there were quite a few straight couples there on dates.  Everyone was  laughing out loud and clapping at the end--something that doesn't seem to  happen much at movies!
In case you can't tell, I highly recommend this  movie!",966556800,20,1350,5.050228310502283
1367619,5,B00004X13Q,"But I'm a Cheerleader is basically a parody/comedy/satire, cleverly written and directed.  I've now seen it 3 times, due to the amusing plot,  the interesting characters and (cough, cough) a slight crush on Clea  DuVall, who plays the object of affection.  It was clever, hilarious and  interesting, and the romance actually added in more of the humor, given  that Megan started out thinking she was straight and ends up, because she  is /told/ that she's not, falling in love with a girl.  Natasha Lyonne  doesn't do as well as she could have, but the rest of the acting is AWESOME  and more than makes up for the slightly questionable casting of the lead.  See this if you can, it's great!",966470400,2,691,4.675
1367620,1,B00004X13Q,"The film centers on Natasha Lyon, a young gay cheerleader whose parents decide that her lesbian tendencies are worrisome. So they ship her off to a  homosexual re-programming intsitution, where she can become  ""straight"" again. The movie starts out good, lot of humor, good  visuals, nice color schemes. It starts out like any good parody should,  showing the obvious moronic behavior of the mass society. Until, the young  girl played by Natasha Lyon falls in love with one of the other girls at  the institution played by Clea Duvall. Then it goes bad, it turns into a  romantic comedy, the serious music starts to play and the director loses  sight of their original intentions. I think it is possible to make a parody  with some elements of a romantic comedy in it, but this film fails at it.  There are mildly amusing gags but the film in the end falls flat and strays  from it's cool indie origins to have a very Hollywood type ending. It is  rated R, but shouldn't be. There is very little language, not much sexual  content, and no violence. The best thing this film does is show how  homophobic Hollywood still is, by slapping an R rating on a film just  because it is about gays and lesbians. It is ironic that the messages that  the film attempts to display are so poorly executed, but the response to  the film shows how much farther our culuture still has to go in it's  acceptance of gays and lesbians. So I guess the film did some good, but  hey, it just didn't do it for me.",966124800,20,1490,4.4721189591078065
1367621,5,B00004X13Q,"Always makes me cry with happiness, a powerful and campy story. Genuinely clever, funny and heartwarming.",1520121600,,105,5.625
1367622,5,B00004X13Q,It's my favorite lesbian movie besides Blue is the warmest color. I just really enjoy the humor in it honestly. People seem to always want to be upset about something but really this movie isn't one of them.,1517875200,,207,4.473684210526316
1367623,3,B00004X13Q,It's actually a decent movie despite the topics and stereotyping of literally everything. Definitely won't be able to watch Hook the same way again.,1517356800,,148,5.208333333333333

1367628,5,B00004X13Q,"Do I really need to rate it? It's amazing.
My only comment is to say that I've always that it would exactly the same if it was directed by John Waters except the soundtrack would be more retro however the actually soundtrack is still flawless. Visually stunning, touching, and unquestionable one of the best lesbian love stories ever told. Women deserve happy endings.",1514937600,,368,4.857142857142857
1367629,5,B00004X13Q,"A surprisingly underrated movie, considering nobody I know has ever heard of it. But it's very funny and a great watch, regardless of the audience. Unless you're a homophobe, in which case, get out.",1514764800,3,198,4.852941176470588

1367631,5,B00004X13Q,"I love this movie. The ending always makes me cry. Well worth owning, in my opinion. Plus it has Mama Ru trying to play it straight for the common good of the overall message of the movie. No matter the way you identify sexually, I still think it's worth watching to understand why you identify that way, and to own your choices.",1510358400,,329,4.32258064516129
1367632,5,B00004X13Q,"Really? If you're reading this review because you haven't seen the movie, you must be living under a rock! A wonderful cult classis like Priscilla Queen of the Desert, Welcome to the Dollhouse, etc.",1509494400,,198,4.852941176470588

1367638,5,B00004X13Q,I kept seeing animated gifs of this movie and I can't believe I didn't pay attention to it when it came out when I was younger. So funny. I laughed out loud at several scenes. An LGBT movie with an all around happy ending. A+,1503100800,,225,4.022222222222222
1367639,5,B00004X13Q,"One of my favorite movies! If you're an ""Orange is the new Black"" fan, you'll love Natasha Lyonne in this too. I first saw this many years ago, then bought it a few years back. It's funny, and an incredibly sweet story.",1502755200,,219,4.238095238095238

1367645,5,B00004X13Q,It was a funny tale of gay love and acceptance with an odd and cleaver cast of chareters that kept me amused and tale an immportant story.,1493942400,,138,4.148148148148148

1367648,5,B00004X13Q,"Very funny, but serious, movie. The actors and actresses work hard to bring the viewer into the film.  I could feel what they're feeling and lose track of my surroundings.  My only disappointment was how typecast the teens are.  It was obviously low budget and there were no big name stars, but that may be part of the magic of the film.  Just a word of caution:  the plot revolves around lesbians and gays so if that concept is uncomfortable for you, it may be best to avoid this movie.  However, there are no overt sexual scenes in the film - its more just hinted at.  Worth looking into",1489190400,,589,4.348623853211009

Trans identity and polysexual identities are not a part of the story, so if you're looking for an all-inclusive film, this may not be the best choice.

1367664,5,B00004X13Q,Hilarious movie! I highly recommend this movie because it has a great message in regards to being yourself - if you identify as queer then that is a big part of who you are.

1367665,3,B00004X13Q,"I was really expecting more from a comedy with Natasha Lyonne.

It is kind of awesome because it shows a wide range of gay characters both male and female and it makes fun of stereotypes and also overly religious or overbearing family members that act as if it is the end of the world. The main character is a cheerleader and when her family and friends have an intervention for her because of some signs that make her seem gay her main response is that ""but I'm a cheerleader."" which just shows the excuses that we tell ourselves that mean that we can't be gay and also the stereotypes that people honestly believe.",1459209600,5,663,4.354838709677419

1367747,5,B00004X13Q,"This is an uncommon movie, and I understand if some won't see it that way. The film creates a timeless environment, combining 1950s and modern-day elements. It reinforces the frame of modern day attitudes towards people with non-heteronormative identities as being comically outdated. The story between the two main characters is more than superficial, but certainly this is not a deep drama. Still, it hits the major beats of the serious coming-out story. Most importantly, this is a comedy, and it is consistently funny, while balancing some much heavier themes. I think it's quite an accomplishment, and a film I will watch again.",1441756800,,633,5.155339805825243

A bit obvious, more controversial 15 years ago than it is now.
Might be useful in an updated birds and bees conversation.

and some of them probably still serve this cultural dystopian  mode,
and some cultural conservatives still spout this line

Natasha Lyonne, RuPaul and so many others did an amazing job poking fun at the traditional roles that men and women are expected to play and the outcomes of being gay in this world.

I thought the plot was pretty good, there were some aspects that were a bit campy but it all tied into the plot once it picked back up. I don't want to tell too much cause I don't want to spoil it but it's a cheeky movie that is going to be one of my favorite ""coming out"" and finding yourself movies of all time.

Lastly, I'd have to also say that the directors choice in eclectic music also made this movie very enjoyable. So much so I tried to see if they have an official soundtrack. Sadly they don't but you can find all the songs to the movie on YouTube and make a playlist! Yes, I loved it that much.

The entire film is ridiculous and that's what makes it so funny.  The filmmakers are essentially saying how absurd these treatment centers are and take full advantage of the situation.  The message of the film is simple -- accept who you are instead of trying to be something you are not.  I love the stereotypes that are portrayed in the film (all gays are vegetarians).  I roared.

Although Cheerleader gets credit for attacking homosexual conversion therapy eight years earlier, Save Me is a very much better movie in every way.

Save Me is both more entertaining and rewarding and MUCH more effective in addressing the therapy fad that claimed to turn gays straight through prayer and therapy but by now (thank God) has been pretty much abandoned even by the fanatics who most strongly pushed it.

The ""humor"" in Cheerleader is so excessively stupid, relentless and campy that it completely undermines any serious message the movie might be trying to present. It comes across as simply a mindless, pointless, frantic, unfunny mess - like a Jerry Lewis movie, for those who remember him.

The head of the conversion camp in both movies is a woman, but the characters are as different as night and day. Judith Light in Save Me is a compassionate person who honestly believes in the work she does and really loves the men who are sent to her for ""help"". Her realization that what she does may NOT actually help, and may instead hurt them, is a far more powerful indictment of the therapy than the gratingly moronic, maniacal, twitching monster Cathy Moriarty plays in Cheerleader.

This movie's only assets are three of its actors: Natasha Lyonne, who can't help being charming no matter what she does; Clea DuVall, who is so subtly and sultrily sexy that she makes even this gay man drool; and RuPaul - OUT of drag - completely credible in an entirely male role: the relatively macho athletic director of the camp, of all things.

But the movie is so stupidly written and directed, and the other actors are so bad, that it is not worth watching - unless by lesbians who can identify more easily with these women than the gay men in Save Me.

1367868,4,B00004X13Q,"But I'm Just a Cheerleader Bowling for Movies Score: 226.125 of 300

On a cold, dark day in Houston, mid-summer, a dream was hatched - a dream of creating a way to organize a vast movie collection.  Oh sure, there are movie ""critics"" and manifold movie blogs and periodicals but these so called ""professionals"" often are out of touch with what I like to call ""The Average Dude"" - you know, your standard issue person on the street.  ""Hey,"" I thought, ""I'm just an average dude aaaaand I have way too much time on my hands aaaaaaand an unordinary number of movies at my finger-tips - literally hundreds and hundreds - and I was endowed with a natural proclivity towards gab.""  This brain flower blossom and bore the fruit which is Bowling for Movies.

Like a mad scientist in his lab, I sat down and created an entirely new system for ranking movies.  Utilizing a plastic spatula, I blended both modern and archaic technology in a synergetic explosion of quasi/pseudo-science which renders Hollywood magic down to a comprehensive (if not patentable) bowling score (which actually has nothing to do with bowling).  Should a movie be simple ok, not really good, not really bad it would receive a score of 108 of 300;  crest 192 of 300 and you've got a bona fidable GOOD movie; crack what I like to call The Hot 200 and you've got a real gem.

But I'm a Cheerleader - we own the DVD version of this ""real gem""

Synoptically Speaking - what's it about?
Outwardly, Megan has it all - high school cheerleader, a great jock boyfriend, a loving and supportive family, faith in god, and friends a-plenty... and then one day it all came crashing down, in the form of an intervention.  You see, Megan (Natasha Lyonne) has been engaging in some ""disconcerting"" behaviors and her friends and family are VERY concerned... the immerging vegetarianism, the Melissa Etheridge CDs, and the lack of enthusiasm in kissing her boyfriend... it can only mean one thing - Megan is a lesbian.  Leading the intervention is ""ex-gay"" Mike (RuPaul) from True Directions, a ""reparative"" camp for ""curing"" homosexuality.  A dazed and confused Megan arrives and continues to profess her non-gay-ness.

The camp leader, Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty), has a 5-step system for rectifying such ""deplorable"" behavior:  Admit your homosexual tendency, reinforce their gender identity through stereotypical boy/girl tasks (men to wood chopping, girls to diaper changing table, etc.), discovering the ""root"" of their homosexuality (one girl's ""root"" was watching her mother wear pants at her wedding), demystifying the opposite sex, and finally - simulated ""normal"" heterosexual intercourse.  Once a candidate passes each step they are ""cured"" and get the honor of walking through a graduation ceremony.

Megan embraces the ""treatment"" and in the process discovers she does in fact have lesbian tendencies.  During Megan's stay at True Directions she befriends fellow campmate Graham (Clea DuVall), an edgy college student with rich, overbearing parents.  The friendship begins to blossom into something more and once a few of the more rebellious patients break out for a night of fun and frolic at a local gay bar with ex-ex-gays Larry and Lloyd - former True Direction students who try to give the alternative to being ""fixed"" - Megan and Graham fall head over heels.

Yada-yada-yada, long story short, their love affair is found out, Megan is disowned by her parents and kicked out of True Directions, Graham chooses to end the relationship and stay in (for fear of being disowned by her parents).  How will this topsy-turvy dramedy end?  Well, I've spoiled enough of the movie already - you'll just have to pick it up and find out!  (If you just said, ""oh no you did'ent"" then the answer to your question is ""oh yes I did"")

OMG - what went terribly RIGHT :]
>>> What a great love story - the love affair between Megan and Graham was beautifully enchanting and wonderfully scripted

>>> We simply loved the art design of the movie with ""traditional"" gender roles portrayed in the harshest pastel blues and pinks which illustrated (spectacularly) the fake quality of assigning gender, well, anything

>>> The character of Megan was crafted to perfectly illustrate the non-choice of homosexuality - LGBT's are BORN, not made - Megan was a good girl, from a good family, attended a good school, and had a faith in Christianity and none of that mattered, she was born lesbian and there is nothing wrong with that!

>>> During the graduation ceremony all the graduates wore formal wear of shiny plastic material... what a great way to show the fake, false, and unnatural farce that is a ""cured"" homosexual;  The Movie Family cries at the thought of a society that would treat any of its citizens this way

What went not so right...
<<< The production value of the film isn't exactly high budget (but they did a wonderful job with this not exactly mainstream film)

<<< I would have liked a little more history / expanded character development before the intervention would have been nice - I might have felt a little more connected to characters

1367876,5,B00004X13Q,"Cheerleader Megan Bloomfield (Natasha Lyonne) has the perfect life, she is attractive, popular and dating the captain of the football. However, her lack of enthusiasm for kissing boyfriend Jared (Brandt Wille), her vegetarianism and a fondness for Melissa Etheridge leads her straight-laced parents Peter (Bud Cort) and Nancy (Mink Stole) to suspect that she is a lesbian. Fearing for their daughter's morality, they pack her off to `True Directions', a homosexual rehabilitation camp.

Megan insists that she is straight until she meets Graham (Clea Duvall); then she really does start to question her sexuality. Lead by strict disciplinarian Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty) and camp counselor Mike (RuPaul), the camp attempts to `de-program' the teens with a crazy five-step program. Remarkably, amid this difficult atmosphere, Graham initiates Megan into her first lesbian affair.

Director Jamie Babbit creates a fantastic satire of heterosexual homophobia and `sexual redirection' schools in her first feature film. Babbit also uses this platform to explore the search for sexual identity and the challenges that gay kids can experience.

Clea Duvall shines as Graham, forced into the camp by her own parents. The tender love scenes between Graham and Megan are beautifully lit and sensitively filmed. Cathy Moriarty is hilarious as over zealous camp leader Mary Brown.

From my queery perspective: Megan blooms from a character ya kinda love to hate (she's a nark, a prude, and a tad snooty) into an inspiring, awesome teenage homo hero. The romance that blooms between Megan and the tomboy character Graham is truly the picture of teeny bopper romance movies from the 80s and early 90s- which is what I loved about the film. It was a romance movie for folks who never had them in their teens! The other kids really make the movie for me-- Sinead was a standout as the masochistic goth girl who is Graham's first girl before Megan shows up.

1367947,5,B00004X13Q,"The ""deprogramming"" and ""conversion"" of gay people to ""ex"" gays is a very serious topic, especially when it comes to the psychological abuse heaped on gay teens by sometimes well-meaning parents and ""therapists,"" and the damage done to gay people and to straight spouses they may later end up marrying as part of their denial, is equally tragic. Storywise there are two ways to portray this, either as a drama/melodrama or as a comedy highlighting the absurdity of trying to change someone's sexual orientation.

To writer/director Jamie Babbit's credit, she chose the lighthearted yet effective approach that uses satirizing stereotypes to underscore how foolish and wrongheaded are attempts to ""deprogram"" gay people. That Clea Duvall's character is forced to go through this because her family will disown her unless she puts on a straight facade, including denying her love for protagonist Megan (Lyonne), makes the situation all the more poignant.

What is most disgusting is that the MPAA not only rated this film as ""R,"" despite its very tame and playful approach to the topic, even the trailer is a ""red-band"" despite there is no nudity, depictions of sex or profanity in the trailers. They made it an ""R"" to limit the teens that could see it and then red-banded the trailer to keep teens from finding out about it.

Natasha Lyonne, Clea DuVall, Michelle Williams, Brandt Wille, Bud Cort, Ru Paul, Richard Moll star in the hilariously cute look at ""Homosexuals Anonymous"" and the after-affects that make it ridiculously funny from beginning to ending.

Natasha Lyonne is a cheerleader who doesn't know she's a lesbian and is sent to ""True Directions"" to get ""straight."" True Directions is run my Mary, who's son is Rock--and he's totally gay, and so is she. Hypocrisy! Her fellow roomies consist of a bunch of people having the shakes from being away from homosexuality. Ru Paul, yes the Drag Queen, is a True Directions leader and apparently in love with Rock. Clea seduces Natasha's character although Sinead hates it.

At True Directions, you have to find your ""root"" (the reason your gay/lesbian). They are hilariously funny.

Richard Moll (the court guard from Night Court) leads the ""underground homosexual railroad"" to show them a balanced perspective as ""Larry Bear.""

All the pent-up sexual tension among the characters leads to a hilarious conclusion you won't want to miss!

1367953,2,B00004X13Q,"But I'm a cheerleader is a story about bigotry and redemption, however not the way it intends to be.

Natasha Lyonne plays a cheerleader from a Christian family who is a tad different, she notices her voluptuous fellow cheerleaders, has photos of women in her locker, and doesn't like the very heavy tongue.

So of course being good Christians they send her off to a re-orientation camp to be forcibly changed by a wicked stepmother type (Played WAY over the top by Cathy Moriarty) and her assistant Ru-Paul without the drag.

The collection of students are, you guessed it stereotypes as well as are the other parents.  The lead characters are wooden and totally uninteresting with performances to match.  Both Moriarty and Ru-Paul however make the best of what they have and are responsible for most of the worthwhile moments in the entire film.  Moriarty's ""Foreplay is for sissies!"" moment is laugh out loud and that entire scene is just plain funny.  Likewise Ru-Paul playing a ""formally gay"" man just shines in physical comedy moments and scene setups.

But mostly the entire picture is about self righteousness.  Not of the films ""villains"" but of the filmmakers.  It is a peon to Hollywood's imaginary image of Christians, how they act, how they think and the brave and oh so tolerant folks who oppose them.  It tries to slap you in the face saying HEY we are funny, and cutting edge and brave to make this movie and if you don't think so you just are just a bunch of ignorant hicks.

Extremely concerned parents send their daughter to a place where they are hoping the people there can remove their daughters strong feelings for other women.  By the time the poor teen girl gets to the place, she's confused, lonely, and a bit scared.  But this is where the storyline REALLY gets good!

She meets another girl who has an obnoxious attitude and doesn't want to be there either, but the two girls eventually develop feelings for each other.  Watching the two girls kiss and fall in love all the while trying to hide their secret love for each other really was rather fun to watch!

Megan (Natasha Lyonne) and Graham (Clea Duvall) are thrown together in the absurd surroundings of a camp aiming to turn gay boys and girls straight by relentlessly forcing heterosexuality down their throats.

Unfortunately for the girls' Boss, Mary (Cathy Moriarty), her efforts to straighten out every one of her charges are doomed to failure - although the viewer can see through the veneer of those who eventually claim that the 'treatment' has worked, the 'Graduation' scene leaves a worrying taste in the mouth - she also tries to ignore the fact that her son isn't as butch as she would wish. He flirts outrageously with 'ex-gay' Mike (RuPaul Charles) who is in charge of butching up the boys.

So I went out and rented it, and it was pretty good.  I had several good laughs, I was able to sympathize with the main character--maybe because I'm bisexual myself, but I think I would have been able to still if I was straight--and I felt that it was a good satire of those ridiculous sexual reprogramming camps.

A lot of the reviews seem to be saying that this is somehow a homophobic movie.  I admit that the guys are more stereotypical queen figures for the most part, but that doesn't make the movie homophobic.  In fact, it sends overall pro-homosexual messages, such as the fact that the kids can't be changed no matter how hard they try.  I also liked the scene where they're trying to figure out what ""turned"" them gay.  None of them can come up with a definite answer to it, of course, which means they just turned out that way, which really shoots some holes in the reprogrammers' theories.

It's not my favorite movie in the world, but at the very least I think it's worth a watch.  If I ever saw it in a bargain bin, I'd buy it--although I doubt that's ever going to happen, since few gay-themed movies make it into the stores in the conservative area I live in.",1198972800,2,1311,4.3580246913580245

Aside from being a goofy, fun love story, it also takes a look at prejudice against homosexuals in our society and one of the techniques people use to change homosexuals--rehabilitation centers. These centers are supposed to change who gay people are attracted to, as if there is something wrong with how and who they choose to love.

Actually, I was bothered by how judgemental, accusatory and condescending some parents were as they ""dis-owned"" and gave-up on their children because of their children's gender issues.  The discreet use of situation appropriate humor took the ""edge"" off in many serious situations and that made the experience even more profound. I felt great compassion and empathy for the main character because of her sense of being ""forced"" into disingeneous feelings that caused her to question her own sanity and place in life. Her ""friend"" was also great in her role, as well. I greatly enjoyed the happy ending and found it refreshing to see that some people can accept people for ""whom and where"" they are in Life and by seeing the Good in all people, irrespective of one's rigid and too tightly wound religious mandates.  The god of the old testament may reign for the Fundamentalist and they may see the rest of us all burning in hell, but for now, I chose to believe that the Almighty Ineffable LOVES everyone, in spite of ""their"" mis-intrepretation of their bible.  The story line also reminded me that in America, Captialism ""rules"" and that if a dollar can be made, some opportunistic ""agency"" will create a modality to invent a venue that provides a service.

Let me tell you I was wrong. I feel ashamed to even say that I couldn't like this movie. Let me explain the movie to you and you see if you wouldn't like it. We start off with Natasha Lyonn playing the character Megan Bloomfield. A cheerleader who is popular, kind, and the girlfriend of the star quaterback in highschool. We see that she doesn't really like to kiss her boyfriend and her family at dinner prays to make things just the way god intended them to be. After school her family, some of her friends and her boyfriend meet her at her house for an intervention. They claim that they fear she is a lesbian. Proving it with evidence of girls picture in her locker, gay memoribilia in her room, she's a vegetarian and the biggest one of all that she doesn't like to kiss her boyfriend. After that she is taken to a sexual redirection camp run by Mary J. Brown played by Cathy Moriarty with her staff RuPaul playing the character Mike who is an Ex gay and her son Rock played by Eddie Cibrian who isn't so manly himself. Where queer boys learn how to be men and Dikey girls learn how to become happy homemakers. (sorry for the rude example). This is where she meets Clea DuVall playing the character Graham Eaton. Seeming like the tough lesbian girl who will never surrender herself to the school. Unfortunately Graham has problems of her own when we discover that she will not be aloud back home, no car and no trust fund if she does not succeed this task. The girls ultimately become friends and attracted to each other. They even have a kiss session when they are rescued from Richard Molls character Larry Morgan-Gordon and his lover Wesley Manns character Lloyd Morgan-Gordon. The training sessions are funny to watch especially with the men. I don't want to ruin any more of the movie for you. If you haven't seen this then you should.

The homosexual characters are well developed and diverse.  there are a couple characters who act stereotypical,  but this occurs among the general population as well.  Effeminate qualities are considered ""gay"" in our society because most men are conditioned to act macho.

With that aside, I found much of this movie to be plausible.  It is inspired by our own history in psychology and the homosexual movement.  When homosexuality was readily accepted as a mental illness, ""cures"" such as aversion therapy and others were practiced on patients.  This ""cure"" is the basis for the plot.

1368058,4,B00004X13Q,"This movie is a true original- the cinematic equivalent of finding a quality toy in a box of stale crackerjack! The stellar Natasha Lyonne plays Megan, a cute, perky cheerleader who is the target of a strange intervention. She`s confronted by her parents and friends, who solemnly inform her that she`s a lesbian and promptly pack her off to a rehabilitation camp. The understandably stunned Megan finds herself in a  bright, tacky dormitory, in which she and her fellow inmates are forced to wear pink and engage in stereotypical female activities - kind of like a Home Economics class that never stops.  Hapless male inmates wear blue and must learn how to play football and repair cars. In the midst of this madness, she discovers her true gay self and falls in love with the angry but vulnerable Graham. The plot of this film seems almost farcial at first, but as it unfolds, one sees that there are more serious issues under the surface.  Watch carefully- it does {unfortunately} feature a few gay caricatures, but actually slams the straights: the camp`s  condescending director, Megan`s meek, conventional parents, her arrogant jock boyfriend who can`t believe she does`nt enjoy kissing him. Great performances by Lyonne, RuPaul as a gung-ho counselor, and Cathy Moriarty as the camp director. Kudos to the set people for creating the weird , preternaturally bright 50`s-style world of the camp and its dorms- it looks as though these scenes were filmed in a Barbie house!

So they send her away to a special camp to try to 'convert' her into a heterosexual. The settings are highly surreal and I hope directer John Waters has seen this because it reminds me so much of his softer flicks. Anyhoo..Megan ends up discovering her true self when she bands with the camp members who escape to a gay bar with some older refugee's from the camp and falls in love with a fellow

camp member and,even when her family denies her she learns to follow her true heart and be herself. Some elements of this film may be a bit disturbing to the more sensative gay people out there but even if they stay with it (if nothing else then to see the out of drag RuPaul eyeing a fellow camper) they'll realize that this movie actually (and often properly) comdemns those still so ignorant and fearefull they believe they believe that homosexuality is a sinful choice and/or lifestyle,rather then the given that it is.

So it honestly comes as a big surprise when she is declared a homosexual and sent to rehabilitation camp. Her parents and friends have used her vegetarian diet and musical taste in Melissa Ethridge to proactively decide that she 'must' be a lesbian. The audience also sees that she does not like kissing her boyfriend very much at the beginning of the film.

Right down to the sugary sweet sessions and obsession with strict gender roles, ""True Directions"" is a lampoon of 'ex gay' programs which gullible parents still send their kids to. Rupal, one of America's most famous drag queens, makes a hilarious cameo appearance as 'Mike'.

Far from 'curing' Megan of her sexuality, this program actually strengthens her conviction that it is how society views them and not the sexuality itself which actually is unhealthy.

During the counseling sessions, the founder Mary (hilariously played by Cathy Moriaty) actually suggests that people are turning to homosexuality only because they do not understand proper gender roles and/or might have lived through the experience of a mother working outside the home.

Megan does manage to find love at this camp. She meets Graham (Clea DuVall) who does not even attempt to follow the ""True Directions"" program.

Since her own parents will literally kill her if she remains a lesbian, Graham represents conscious political resistance in this otherwise homophobic environment because she is comfortable with who she is and recognizes the program is garbage.

You can pretty much fill in the blanks from here, as there are no surprises in the script. The gay males are stereotypical queens, although oddly the women aren't all stereotypical ""bull dykes"".

Cathy Moriarty makes a great turn as the head of a program to ""cure"" teens of their homosexuality, without realizing that her own son is dancing to showtunes while mowing the lawn.  Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall carry the movie wonderfully, and you actually believe the connection between the two of them (as opposed to a lot of other gay film leads).

Complaints: There are a few. The plot is cheesy, the music is horribly cliche, and the characters are so incredibly stereotypical it's almost embarassing.
Praises: Proof for questioning people (like myself) that despite what parents may think, being gay is not wrong. Plus, it stars Clea Duvall!

The casting was perfect, the costumes and sets were both political and laugh-out-loud funny, and the plot...well, I've never seen anything like it...and perhaps the highest praise I can give it is this: this is a lesbian ""chick flick"" even a group of gay men would love! (...) This is a witty, well-made, well-acted film. It's an affirmation of what it is to be young, to be female, to be gay, to feel like an outcast--things we should all be able to symphathize with, even if we can't empathize. My point is, you don't have to be gay to enjoy this movie, but if you are, that's wonderful, and perhaps this film will open up some doors for you, by making you realize you're not alone. In addition, if you or your mother ever took a home economics course, or read a 1950's textbook directing you how to cater to your ""man's needs,"" this film will give you a real giggle...it's full of those reflective moments when strong, sensible women have to take a step back and say, ""if being a lady means I have to spend more time using my elbow grease than my brain, is it really worth it?""",1079913600,4,1350,4.605809128630705

1368137,4,B00004X13Q,"""But I'm a Cheerleader"" stars Natasha Lyonne, Clea DuVall, RuPaul Charles, and Oscar nominee Cathy Moriarty.  This explores coming out and coming into terms towards one's own homosexuality.  The plot is highly original and brilliant.  This combines comedy and drama wonderfully.  Sometimes, one's expressed more than the other, which is always done at the perfect times.  The intensity builds the moment Megan enters ""rehab""(notice the quotes).  Romance lingers in the air as she falls in love with a fellow patient.  Every scene displays the realisms of gay issues and the harsh ex-gay movement.  Such topics are proven researched thoroughly by the producers and the writers.  Though in real life, most homosexuals do not act as portrayed in the movie, it still has its entertaining aspects.
Natasha Lyonne plays her lead character, Megan, wonderfully.  She offers ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" the added comedy and drama in the perfect places.  The highly underrated Clea DuVall proves in her role as Graham, fellow patient and Megan's lover, that she'll become a big name actress soon.  Her acting is flawless.  RuPaul Charles performs beautifully and hilariously without his drag queen persona in his role of Mike, the counseller.  His role alone portrays the ex-gay movement realities accurately.  Cathy Moriarty's role as the evil ""rehab"" president gives the movie its conflict vibe wonderfully.  All other actors also perform great.
""But I'm a Cheerleader"" is a great movie for many audience types.  This is a great gay pride movie.  Many viewers will be highly entertained.  Those looking for more gay pride themes should also watch ""Get Real"".  The two combined offers an unforgettable experience.",1071878400,4,1700,5.272388059701493
1368138,3,B00004X13Q,"I felt this film didn't reach the potential of its concept or its superb cast, although it was enjoyable. The sets and costumes are good, almost carrying the film through an aura of 1950s innocence and hypocrisy. And there were some hilarious scenes (my favourite is the wooden cut-out of the soldier pointing his *ahem* gun at another kneeling in submission).
But most of the humour is based on the same stereotypes that I expected the film to subvert. For most of the movie, there was no attempt to portray the campy gay boys in a thoughtful way. Actually, there was little character development altogether, but most infuriating was this seeming self-contradiction -- the film succumbed to the misconceptions of the homophobic institutions it was also attacking, but without any obvious awareness of this paradox. As a result, I'll admit I didn't find the film very funny or clever.
The best thing about this movie, for me, was the soundtrack. It kicks off with a wonderful kitschy, girly, faux-retro-pop song by April March called ""Chick Habit"", which is infectious and delicious as sin. There are some gorgeous Go Sailor songs like ""Ray of Sunshine"" which highlight the cute, first-love factor. And during the love scene (which is one of the best I've seen), ""Glass Vase Cello Case"" by Tattle Tale provides the most beautiful music for the sweet and pretty cinematography.
I don't think there's a soundtrack available, so maybe this film is worth listening to, at least. Although, just to be shallow, the cast is very aesthetically pleasing so you may as well watch it too.",1069459200,6,1577,4.910112359550562

Matter of fact I live in the next town over form the Lesbian Capitol of Massachusetts, and they're some of the BEST people you'd EVER want to know. I agree with the other reviewer on here who says you do NOT have to be Gay to enjoy this movie. It's just a really feel-good type of flick, about a young school-aged Cheerleader coming to grips with her sexuality. I caught it one night on IFC, (Independent Film Channel) on Satellite TV with my wife, as we were flicking through the channels, and we both absolutely loved it. It's funny as hell. The humor is dry & witty. We even have Richard Moll, (Bull, from Night Court) playing one half of a gay couple, and he has HAIR, by God. Although that's been known now for awhile. We even have Ru Paul OUT, (literally) of DRAG, in this flick. I would compare this movie closely to like a John Waters flick, (Think Hairspray, Polyester Gen), in terms of humor. If you like this kind of humor, as much as I do, then I think you'll really enjoy this film?We missed about the first 15min. of this on IFC, but we finally tracked down the OOP release of this, brand-new, and sealed for $10. Can't beat that price for this great movie. Even Roger Ebert's comments are on the cover of this movie. ""A Very Funny Movie""- Roger Ebert, Roger Ebert & The Movies.

  The actors are great and since seeing it I've become a big Clea Duvall fan.  A surprising turn by Rupaul is also a highlight.  The film doesn't take itself to seriously and makes it's point with humor and skill.

1368161,4,B00004X13Q,"Possibly one of the best gay & lesbian interest comedies in recent years (far eclipsing the sentimental and condescending 'Jeffrey' in terms of likeability), 'But I'm a Cheerleader' charts the story of a teenager's coming-to-terms with her homosexuality, via a summer camp that attempts to train gay teens to be straight.
Natasha Lyonne gives an extremely endearing performance as the hapless Megan (she's a comic actress of note: her timing is excellent and she has one of the most expressive faces of recent years), who is trying to please her family & friends by becoming straight. Cathy Moriarty gives a typecast (but excellent) performance as the Joan Crawford-esque camp leader and a fantastic cameo by a drag-free RuPaul as an ex-gay Camp Leader completes the ensemble cast.
The script is simplistic but does the job, and the real joy of the film lies in the likeable visual cliches of the 'True Directions' camp - the blue and pink dormitories, the plywood silhouettes of men doing manly things, and the debutante-like graduation party at the end of the movie all come together to make something sweet, lighthearted and genuinely funny.
Highly recommended for all fans of comedy, 'But I'm a Cheerleader' is a very charming, lighthearted look at the effects of peer pressure.
(Also, to note, a cameo by Mink Stole as Megan's mother - from 'Pink Flamingoes' and 'Serial Mom' to possibly the most unglamorous woman on the planet!!)",1066521600,3,1436,5.01255230125523

1368165,4,B00004X13Q,"It's one of the funnier and more clever gay/lesbian flicks to have come out in recent years. It is the story of Megan (Natasha Lyonne), a prissy high school cheerleader who is disgusted w/ kissing her jock boyfriend and likes to fantasize about her cheerleader gal pals. Her family and friends suspect lesbianism is the culprit. And while Megan never really shows any major ""lesbian tendencies"", her parents list a few wacked stereotypes of what they feel is lesbian behavior. They are afraid that if they don't act fast, she'll be lost forever. They send her to the True Directions Rehabilitation Camp for Homosexuals - or like her mother calls it, ""Homosexuals Annonymous"". The camp is run by Mary, (Cathy Moriarty) who founded the camp, probably to make up for failed attempts to convert her son Rock (Eddie Cibrian). Ru Paul (out of drag) plays a camp counselor and is an ex-(but obviously still gay)-gay man, who is secretly attracted to Rock. But he'd never admit to it.

Megan herself doesn't feel that she is a homosexual and she comes to the realization that she is gay in an interesting manner, yet she feels it will be easy to be ""fixed"" so she could go home. Once in the process of becoming an ex-gay, Megan actually develops lesbian desires - or at least comes completely out of the closet to herself and falls for her roommate, Graham (Clea DuVall), an outsider rich girl with an attitude. And they clash in the typical 'good girl meets bad bo -- oops I mean girl' -- story and they fall in love. But True Directions will have none of that! And make every ridiculous attempt at making them ""normal"" fun-loving heterosexuals.

Not so much serious as it is funny, BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER throws out some of my favorite lines like Clea's ""I'm Graham, and I like girls. A lot! (smile)"" Or ""Get caught in the throws of sodomy, and it's 'au revoir'"". And NaTasha's off the wall ""Underground Homo-Railroad"" comment that had me rollin'. It makes fun of gay sterotypes and homosexual conversion camps. A little over the top and goofy at times, which is why I liked it. Good for some laughs...",1059609600,6,2095,4.644204851752021

Everything's going well except for one teeny tiny little problem.  She falls in love.
There's more to it.  Lots of funny characters.  Lots of funny scenes.  And gosh its just funny to see a spoof off those places that tell you that they can make you straight.
Definitly a movie to see if you're in the mood to laugh.",1054944000,2,721,4.503875968992248
1368167,4,B00004X13Q,"I was taken by surprise when I watched this. It starts simply enough, but the intervention was entriely surreal, which was nicely reflected in the heroine Megan's reaction to it. From there it becomes even more bizarre, as she's taken to a totally surreal hetero training camp. Already confused, I had to deal with an incredulous camp where they bunk lesbians-teens and gay-teens together, sharing bedroom, bathroom, and dressing in identical leatherette outfits...tell me you don't think this was a breeding ground for homosexual thoughts...and temptations...well now I was ready for anything. The peripheral characters did represent some stereotypes, but after a while it was the larger message of the film coming through and it changed my feelings as I watched this film. The love story, though somewhat predictable, is very cute and draws you in, but the obstacles in front of them seem formidable. Really, in terms of today's society it's easy to be outraged by the militant approach and attitude of the wackos running the camp. You are totally on the side of the teens and hope they will somehow all reject the efforts to make them straight and blow up the camp a la Rock N Roll high school. But it doesn't happen quite that way, there's no real judgement of anyone, relying on dialog and actions of the character to steer the viewer. It's somewhat subtle, and the twist is how Graham opts for the easy way out and it is Megan, the reluctant lesbian, that is the brave one at the end. There is an irony at the end of the film, you may miss it if you blink. Megan's mother is attending a ""Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays"" meeting. The tables are turned, and rather than trying to force her daughter to accept something against her will, she is forced to accept her daughter's choice. The truth is not always easy. The movie, as I said, is a little confusing, and despite some plot elements lacking follow-through, it does contain an important message about accepting yourself and others as they are. It's light, but I don't know if it's very funny. I think it's a serious topic treated in a light way. The surrealism adds to the unreality felt by Megan at the outset. Eventually she begins to come around to accepting the truth, and this accents the surreal feel of the world they are trying to force her to accept. By the way there is some pretty coarse language in parts of this film, but it is used effectively and in unlikely places. Overall the film is very offbeat in presentation, well-produced, and due to the 5-step process keeps you watching.",1052956800,3,2566,4.704444444444444
1368168,5,B00004X13Q,"This is a hysterical movie. I laughed so hard I cried. It's a great, satirical look at the ex-gay ministries like Exodus and its ilk. It's campy fun with a ring of truth. Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is a high school cheerleader whose family and friends fear she might be lesbian. So her repressed parents ship her off to True Directions, a camp designed to turn gay kids straight. The camp, run by Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty), looks like a Pepto-Bismol bottle exploded - pink everywhere. Rupaul has a great role as one of the camp counselors who may not be as ex-gay as he'd like everyone to think. At camp, the first step is to admit that you are a homosexual, which Meghan just can't bring herself to do. In one hysterical scene, she cries out, ""I can't be gay! I'm a cheerleader!"" At least, that's what she thought before she met her new friend, Graham (Clea DuVall), who seems quite sure she likes girls.
The movie has a blast poking holes in the rhetoric of the Moral Majority's claim that you can change your sexual orientation. You'll have a blast watching it. It also contains a great message about being true to who you really are and following your heart's path.",1051574400,5,1167,4.509433962264151
1368169,4,B00004X13Q,"But I'm a Cheerleader is a delicious anti-religious comedy about ""homosexuality rehabs"" - Christians who brainwash homosexuals into ""abandoning"" their sexuality. Such endeavours are counter-nature and futile, of course, and But I'm a Cheerleader exploits this to the hilt.
Megan is a vegetarian and has posters of women on her walls. Obviously she is a lesbian, and her parents ship her off to a rehabilitation camp. But then she finds out that she really is. While she is wringed thru the camp's trials and tribulations, she falls in love with a fellow lesbian. And so it goes.
There is comedic energy in spades here, as the camp's trials are revealed as little more than repressed homosexuality. But there is also a heart-wrenching message about the cruely of repressing human nature, and the superiority of passion over duty. And of course the lesbian kissing scenes. Can't forget that.",1050624000,,889,5.054421768707483

The idea backfires - in a house full of gay teenagers, she falls in love.  The cast is also charming.  Yet for me the movie fails, since it is just too exagerrated to be funny.  Although the idea in general is believable, everything about the execution is just way too over the top.  The general idea of this film was handled much better in In and Out, which had believable characters, a generally believable plot, and much more humor.

1368171,4,B00004X13Q,"I really enjoyed this movie. If anything I think it really proved how much stereotypes inhibit our day to day lives, and it has a nice message. That message to me is just because some gay people act a certain way does not mean it is the only way to be, and that you can just be whoever you want to be. The movie concerns a young cheerleader who is 17, and her family and friends deduce she is a lesbian. She is in denial until she is sent to this ""straight school"" called True Directions, where she mingles with other homosexuals who hope to become straight, and are taught through 5 steps to do so. The idea of such a place is proposterous and funny in itself, but the characters are very individual and enigmatic, and interesting. The camp forces her to fall in love with a tomboy like girl, and yes in the end they end up together. Excellent casting with RuPaul as one of the camp directors. Yes the movie screams stereotypes at times but I think it further enhances the idea. It's not a movie to be taken too seriously but its cute and funny on its own and it does happen to push a good idea, that we should all just be ourselves and we should never label ourselves or try to fit into any one lifestyle, because uniqueness is one of the greatest things of life I think.

1368198,3,B00004X13Q,"I purchased ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" after hearing rave reviews here and elsewhere for the DVD.  Unfortunately, I think I spent too much money on it.  Let me explain - But I'm a Cheerleader IS a cute, funny, and at times emotionally involving story of a girl sent away to a ""Straight is Great"" camp to become straight again.  It's funny and cute, but there are weak points in characterisation and other areas that might disenchant some viewers.
I do recommend that people rent ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" if they are looking for an off-the-wall teen drama/comedy that is miles off of the beaten path.  But do yourself a favor - watch it before you decide to buy it, as some may find it a single-watching kind of movie.",1041120000,2,713,4.503875968992248
1368199,4,B00004X13Q,"But I'm a Cheerleader was easily one of the funniest movies I had seen in a while that genuinely funny (not stupid funny or even Jackass funny) but still very good.
This is a light hearted comedy about your typical American girl next door (Megan), who (by parents and friends and even a RuPaul out of drag!) is counseled and sent to school for kids who think they are ""gay"". During Megan's stay at the school, she realizes who she really is and who she really loves.
I gotta say, this was a good movie. It was funny all around and it still kept you interest. For a lot of people, this movie had a good message about how hard it can be to be a teen and realize that you're gay but still it has a good humor about it and it doesn't defame anyone at all.
My one problem with this movie is that it went from being hilarious throughout the movie and then shifting to super serious at the end and that almost made the ending too cheesy. But still, the ending you could live without because the rest of the movie was great.",1036454400,,1016,4.16243654822335
1368200,5,B00004X13Q,"Not a movie that's meant to be taken terribly seriously, but a one that's fun to watch and one which at moments catches you off-guard with its insight. Natasha Lyonne stars as a cheerleader who hugs her friends too much, can't stop thinking about her fellow squad members while she's kissing her boyfriend, is a vegetarian, and has a poster of Melissa Etheridge on her wall. Her parents, boyfriend and friends decide that she needs to be straightened out, and send her off to True Directions, a sexual rehabiliation camp where she will reclaim her true heterosexuality. Girls wear pink, boys wear blue, and they must participate in a five-step program to relearn their gender roles and their sexuality.
The problem, of course, with putting a bunch of lesbians in the same (pink, pink, pink!) room is that you're bound to have some attraction. The object of Megan's affections is the moody Graham, played by Clea DuVall. (At which point most of the audience decide that this is going to be a very good movie indeed. ;))
Megan fights her attraction but soon accepts that she is who she is. Graham, despite acting brave and proud of her sexuality (""I'm Graham and I like girls. A lot."") is under pressure from her parents to 'get it out of her system' with the threat of no college fund or support of any kind if she doesn't. Megan turns out to be the one who's not ashamed of who she is - and the question is whether Graham will follow her or not... the answer to which can be found in the movie, so let me take this moment to highly recommend that you buy it.
The soundtrack's fabulous, as well. Not available on CD, but try to get your hands on the mp3s, because there are some truly amazing songs featured in the movie.
All in all - great movie, with some funny moments, some touching, some silly, some beautiful. 10/10.",1030406400,34,1821,4.5212121212121215

1368205,4,B00004X13Q,"There's something about Megan, a pretty, feminine cheerleader with lots of friends and a popular, handsome boyfriend that makes her family think she's a lesbian-in-denial (and, you'll note, in need of some heterosexualizing).  Could it be the fact that she seems to find kissing her boyfriend to be a most disgusting experience?  Or could it be those posters of hot women in her locker?  Or perhaps, the fact that she's been pushing tofu on everyone just a little too enthusiastically?
At any rate, Mommy & Daddy send their little angel to a ""sexual orientation rehab"" to ... straighten her out.
When Megan arrives at True Directions (har, har) and meets the militant rehab director, her (mainly) butch female classmates, and (mainly) flaming male classmates, and RuPaul (errrrm, so to speak - watch the movie!) ... she is in utter denial.  It takes her a little while, but Megan figures out why she avoided her boyfriend's attempts at physical affection and stared, entranced, at certain parts of her fellow cheerleaders's scantily-clad anatomies.  The idea that she might be something other than ""normal"" (read: heterosexual) had never occurred to her before.  Now -
""Oh my God!  I'm a homosexual!  I'm a homosexual!""
From there, this movie takes you on a wild ride involving (among other things!) ""The Doghouse,"" sex simulation, a couple of guys who offer an alternative to ""sexual orientation rehab,"" some freaked-out parents, a little bit of healthy lust, new love, and, of course ... cheerleading!
I recommend it to everyone, as a very cute, amusing comedy ... and I'd also like to warn everyone not to forget that there have existed in the past and DO exist in the present certain REAL ""sexual orientation rehabs,"" very different than this movie's ""True Directions"" pretend-rehab.  The movie's portrayal of such places is amusing; the reality is notably more ... sinister.

1368218,5,B00004X13Q,"Think teenaged angst in hot pink, and you have a slight idea of what this movie is about. A social satire, it mocks the theory of ""curing"" homosexuals by presenting us with a ""camp"" for doing just that. And when I say camp, I mean camp! From the Nazi-like owner/instructor, a Cruella deVille wannabee played to the hilt by Cathy Moriarty, to the uniforms forced on the male and female campers (pink for girls, blue for boys--but of course!), to the hilarious anti-gay ""exercises,"" there is not a dull moment in this truly funny but also touching film.
The story surrounds an innocent cheerleader (played by Natasha Lyonne), who is hit with a surprise ""intervention"" (side-splitting) from her parents and friends, who accuse her of being a lesbian, something that had never entered her mind. Nevertheless, she is sent to the reprogramming camp. There, due to the relentless ""exercises,"" she does indeed get in touch with her lesbian self, and falls in love with a tough-talking but vulnerable girl named Graham.
Along the way, every cliche ever implied about gays and lesbians is lampooned in a way that not only makes the viewer laugh out loud, but also lays bare the ridiculous nature of such stereotypes. The end, which borrows liberally from ""The Graduate,"" is a masterpiece in itself.

1368226,3,B00004X13Q,"Hey, guys, if you wondering about the content of the film, see, it's Natasha Lyonne, hit-or-miss actress of young generation.  She was in ""American Pie"" (terrific!), ""Slums of Bevery Hills"" (SHE was good, anyway), and ""Confessions of Trickbaby (no comment).  And this time, she is great; but the film is....maybe.
You know, Ms. Lyonne exudes a strange cuteness in her ""Oh-Gosh-I'm-in-trouble face.""  And now she shows it again a lot.  In the campy institution full of pink, she is ordered to 'cure' her habit, namely, lesbianism.  But of course, you cannot get rid of your sexuality; it is there for you to cope with.  So, though she willingly progresses her 5-staged course of 'rehabilitation,' she realizes that one of her friends is attracted with her, and she herself with her.  The budding relationship between Lyonne and Clea Duvall (again locked in ""Girl, Interrupted"") is the best assets of the film.
Now, many people think ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" a comedy, and rightly so.  But in my opinion, as a comedy, it hardly succeeds.  Mellisa Ethridge poster idea is certainly interesting, but we have seen the same kind of things in ""In & Out"" (remember records of B. Streisand).  Many comic elements relies on stereotypes of gays and lesbians, and because campy touch of the film is not given enough power to knock out our concept on sexuality, the idea of grey skin-tight leotards with fig leaf ends up with half-baked results.  Yes, I admit, it is funny, but not enough, I think.  Think how John Waters might have done it.  Think Pedro Almodobar.
The cast is good, and even makes us smile with our memory of past films -- Mink Stole is a John Waters regular, and Melanie Lynskey was in ""Heavenly Creatures,"" another film with lesbiamism theme (with Kate Winslet before ""Titanic"").  And I always welcome Julie Delpy even in one minute.  But I need more shock to my brain.  This is not to say the film is bad; on the contrary, it is pretty good, but not as a comedy, but as a love-story.
Lastly, if you're interested in romantic comedy or drama dealing with homosexuality among school, turn to Europe.  I strongly recommend ""Show Me Love"" from Sweden, and ""Get Real"" from UK.

1368234,3,B00004X13Q,"***1/2  As gays and lesbians have achieved more and more acceptance in our society, a countervailing force - led mostly by conservative religious organizations - has been rearing its head in recent years.  The movement is often referred to as ""reparative therapy,"" the rather absurd notion that, with just a little grit, determination and behavior modification, homosexuals can be ""cured"" of their ""illness"" and groomed to take their place as fine, upstanding members of the heterosexual community.  Certain ""treatment centers"" dedicated to this dubious cause have even begun to spring up in areas around the country, modeling themselves after 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous.
The makers of ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" have chosen to have a little fun with the concept, imagining one of these centers in almost surrealistic terms.  Sweet-faced Natasha Lyonne stars as Megan, a regular teenager happily content to give her all to her cheerleading squad and only mildly confused as to why she can't seem to get quite as excited by her boyfriend as by thoughts of her buxom cheerleader buddies.  Suspecting her of being a lesbian - long before Megan herself does, actually - her ""concerned"" parents, friends and boyfriend cart her off to True Directions, a treatment center tucked safely away in the country.  In this bucolic setting, Megan and a group of other ""deviants"" are put through the rigors of a 5-step therapy program which includes admitting their homosexuality, undergoing gender role playing and even ""practicing"" man/woman sexual behavior under the stern tutelage of the mistress of the place.  In keeping with the near-surrealism of the subject matter, the center is done up in an almost Montessori school motif, with bold colored walls and furniture somehow emphasizing the cold, inhuman sterility of the setting.
""But I'm a Cheerleader"" is, by no means, a great or entirely successful comedy.  Its attempts at humor, particularly in its opening scenes, seem a bit forced and heavy-handed at times. Moreover, the tone shifts a bit uneasily every so often, running the gamut from stylized absurdity to heartbreaking seriousness.  Still, the undisciplined messiness is really part of the film's overall charm.  It removes the work from the same category as all those ultra-slick bubble-headed comedies about teens that major studios seem to release with frightening regularity.  And the movie does have many laugh-out-loud moments of inspired lunacy, showing to what preposterous lengths many straights and even some pressured gays will go in order to ""correct"" the uncorrectable.  We see the girls being given instructions on how to use a vacuum cleaner, wear makeup and change diapers.  The boys are instructed in the fine arts of wood chopping, throwing a football and fixing cars.  These scenes work, in particular, not only for their comic effectiveness but their underlying poignancy, as these scared youngsters - many threatened with disownment by their parents if they don't ""straighten up"" - give it their all, against all hope, to truly change, to deny the very person their raging hormones are screaming at them to be.
The movie also manages to make the gay characters seem real and believable.  Thanks to a superb cast, many of the teens emerge as touching, three-dimensional people rather than the cartoon characters that they might have become in a similar film of this kind - particularly when it would be so easy for them to become so in the face of the caricatures of parents and camp counselors who swirl around them in this highly stylized setting.  Prime among these is Cathy Moriarty, brilliant as Mary, the prim and proper leader of the establishment, a woman whose righteous wrong-headedness the actress captures to a comic tee.  In contrast, Rue Paul, out of drag for once, gives a superbly understated performance as an ""ex-gay"" now working for the enemy.  Among the teens, Lyonne and Clea DuVall, as the girl Megan falls in love with, are the obvious standouts.  They turn these potentially cardboard comic characters into full-sized, instantly recognizable young women filled with yearning, confusion and a desire to both please others and be true to themselves.
And that is the ultimate message of this film.  Though done in an absurd way, the movie strives to point out that all of us must be allowed to be who we are and to live the life that best suits us.  Whether we are gay, straight or whatever, that's a philosophy of life we all need to be reminded of from time to time.",997833600,10,4525,5.063257065948856

1368248,5,B00004X13Q,"This film is a lighthearted look at a gay cheerleader who is sent by well-meaning parents and friends to a special camp that de-programs gay teens and attempts to set them ""straight."" I did see some interesting subtleties in this film, such as a person's perception of what is normal (in this case, straight). Megan, the gay cheerleader, thinks she is normal--until society (represented by friends, parents, and True Directions) tells her she's not. Initially she denies her lesbianism because: 1) she's a Christian; 2) she has a boyfriend; and 3) she's a cheerleader--supposedly an exclusively heterosexual institution. She is in shock and pain when she realizes that she is indeed gay in spite of her ""heterosexual"" lifestyle. A humorously wry comment on Society's perception of who is gay is represented by Jan, the softball player, who ""looks and acts gay"" but is straight. She is sent to True Directions because of her mannish appearance and love of softball. What's hilarious is that each gay teen gives clear indications that their stay at ""True Directions"" will never convert them, although the Director Mary Brown (Cathy Moriatry) seems oblivious to that fact. Even RuPaul's ""Ex-Gay"" character has moments of weakness caused by Mary's son Rock. The musical soundtrack is fantastic and really adds to the film. The costumes and set designs are very clever, especially for the True Directions scenes, with the girls dressed in Baby Pink outfits and sleeping in a large bedroom the color of Pepto Bismol; and the boys, of course, in Baby Blue. I was reminded of the old 1970's cheerleader films when I first initially saw the title, then chuckled when I saw that this film is a 1990's twist on the cheerleader genre. Seeing RuPaul out of drag playing an ""ex-gay"" was an ingenious piece of casting and worth the price of this DVD alone.",992736000,2,1841,4.941935483870968
1368249,5,B00004X13Q,I thought this movie was great! It show's all the pain homosexuals go through and people should give them a break because you can't help if your gay. Clea Du Vall is truely one of my favorite actresses because she has a really believible way of telling people in this movie that lesbiens falling in love is just as good as straight  people falling in love. You are what you are right? I suggest this movie to any one who picks on lesbiens and really needs to put  there self in there place before making fun of them again.,992304000,3,522,4.262626262626263
1368250,3,B00004X13Q,"Perhaps the greatest virtue of But I'm a Cheerleader is that it makes no attempts to take itself too seriously.  On some level, that approach to a film such as this, which deals with the serious topic of teenage sexual self-discovery, might seem undermining.  But on the level on which most of this film operates -- as a comedy that emphasizes ridicule at the expense of a slightly more sophisticated tone -- its mocking and slightly self-depricating nature works to a charm.
The film stars a small hometown girl named Megan (Natasha Lyonne) whose family and close friends all come to the conclusion that she is, despite being the model cheerleader and having the typically good-looking football-playing boyfriend, a lesbian.  In an attempt to set her on the right path, they decide that the best solution for Megan would be an intensive experience at True Directions, a type of ""straight camp.""  There, Megan finally comes to the conclusion herself that she is, indeed, gay.  The realization comes when she finds herself smitten with the enigmatic and emotionally, beautifully wounded Gramm (Clea DuVall).  From here, put two and two together, and you can figure out the rest: the movie successfully drives home its point, which is that sexuality is not a choice and cannot be taught or learned.
The actual humor of the movie is intertwined in the plot itself (for instance, when Megan is at straight camp and finally confesses to herself and to the group that she is gay, all the while screaming, ""I'm a homosexual!"" and drooling from the mouth), but much of it is in the hidden sequence of events.  There is, of course, the ridiculousness of her parents' constant appearance against the backdrop of disgusting earth tone colors in their clothing and home decoration.  But more accessible is the over-stereotypification of the homosexuals throughout the film: the flamer, the butch lesbian, the Catholic school girl, the girl whose sexual confusion is caused by her sexual identity problems, the Jewish boy, the angry femme...it goes on.  Every stereotype you can name is in the film.  And to top it all off is the out-of-drag RuPaul as the camp leader to tell them all how hetero is done.
All in all, this movie is a light load that's easy to watch, if for no other reason than to watch Clea DuVall.  But be warned: it's predictable, it's cheesy, and it's grossly pink.  But then again, maybe those are the best things about it.",992217600,3,2431,4.831325301204819
1368251,4,B00004X13Q,"I was shocked that I had never even heard of this movie. The film itself is difficult to describe. The main character, a cheerleader, has been fantacizing about her fellow cheerleaders. She has been considered a lesbian by her family and friends, so they decide to send her to a camp called ""True Directions"" (the recruiter being RuPaul). Both the male and female homosexuals of the group at ""True Directions"" are your clich lesbians and gays. The humor lies in the anachronism of a plot; these clichs; the therapies involved; the colors used symbolically. For example, the boys must learn how to fix automobiles and chop wood to learn their gender roles, while the girls have to learn how to change diapers and vacuum. The entire time, both sexes are fantasizing about their co-campers of the same sex and it is obvious that the therapy is not working.
The end is a bit rushed and pointless, but overall the entertainment value was high.",991872000,2,938,4.7607361963190185

1368254,5,B00004X13Q,"I saw this movie 3x in the theatres in NYC when it came out... and bought the DVD as soon as it came out.  This is a hilarious satire on a puritanical view of homosexual life, as the main characters try to ""cure"" themselves.  There is a very JohnWaters-esque feel to the colors and costumes.  The dialog is witty and funny, especially if you are/know a homosexual.  ""But you're a vegetarian,"" is an accusation, the main character gets as proof that she's a lesbian - to me, a very funny lesbian stereo-type.  This movie gently makes fun of stereo-types, but also makes it clear that it's ok to be who you are.  The filming/costuming/sets are beautiful - and the color is breathtaking.  Clea DuVall steals the picture, but sadly, it is Natasha Lyonne that solely gets the credit for it on the movie posters (and even on the Amazon search).

1368265,1,B00004X13Q,"I'm so shocked that people could actually sit through this video. The plot is completely outrageous. A girls parents decide she's gay because she's a vegetarian and she has a Melissa Ethridge poster on her wall? Firstly, tons of kids are vegetarians these days. Secondly, how would two conservative parents know that Melissa Etheridge is a pop icon who appeals to the gay community slightly more than to straight people? That would be like if a normal guy who happened to be a school teacher, ran out of chalk, and everyone kept accusing him of eating it. It's like, ""Well, if you didn't eat the chalk, what did you do with it? We're sending you to the clinic, sicky."" What a ridiculous conclusion to come to for no reason! Now I'm all about Krazy Komedy in movies, but there was nothing funny about this film. I don't think gay people are funny just because they're gay. That's rude. It's like saying, ""You like Girls? God, that's a riot."" So if you're into really bad movies with no redeming qualities whatsoever, you've struck gold.",983318400,7,1035,4.66120218579235

1368268,5,B00004X13Q,"This is the most ridiculous film I have ever seen.  The absolute absurdity and unbelievability of the entire plot is beyond belief.  And you know what?  I loved this film.  Natasha Lyonne gives a stellar performance as Megan, a high school cheerleader who is sent away in order to rid herself of what her parents see as ""unnatural tendencies"".  While there, she meets Mary, brilliantly played by Cathy Moriarty, the head of the camp who has taken over the task of ingraining heterosexual values into the ditzy high school student.  During her stay she comes into contact with a motley group of people trying to go straight. Clea Duvall's portrayal of Graham as a pessimistic and brooding parental disappointment is the perfect foil for the optimistic/goody two shoes Megan and is never overblown or excessive.  RuPaul's performance as Mary's assistant and Eddie Cibrian's portrayal as her son Rock, are extremely funny and absurd at the same time.  Although this film is a satire on the ""ex gay"" movement, there are some scenes that are so accurate and true regarding love, attraction and disappontment, that the viewer ends up nodding in agreement.  Do yourself a favor and watch this film.  It's hilarious!",971568000,141,1208,4.965174129353234
1368269,4,B00004X13Q,"Unfortunately, this movie never played at the theater in my home town, but fortunately, I managed to buy it on DVD.  I first heard of this movie while perusing Roger Ebert's reviews, and his review interested me in seeing it, but it didn't play here, and I forgot about it agin until I luckily ran across the title on Amazons new and future releases, and recognized the title.
The movie is both a very funny comedy, and a sweet budding romance story, smoothly blended together.  My sister and I watched it together one afternoon, and then watched it again the following day, enjoying it as much both times, and I plan on rewatching it many more times.  The first time we watched it, my sister was playing around on the computer when I first put the movie in, but by the time the first few minutes had played, the computer was forgotten and she was as absorbed as I was.
The beginning scenes are splendid, where we first begin to get an inkling of Megan's(the main character) true interest, which isn't her boyfriend.  Then, when her intervention is staged, and her introduction into the group at True Directions began, we could hardly stop laughing.  Stereotypes abound in the movie, but they never take theirselves too seriously, and add to the general feel of the movie.
Still, if the romance hadn't developed as smoothly as it did, the comedy would all be for naught.  Fortunately, the two main characters play well off each other, and keep the movie alive.  If the two actresses hadn't been able to generate some onscreen chemistry, and actually have been able to make it seem as if it were possible for the two of them to fall in love, the movie wouldn't have succeeded.  They did manage to look as if they were falling in love, and enjoying themselves, so for me, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
One last thing, something my sister said that kind of tied up the whole experience for me.  The first time that Megan and Graham started kissing, she made this comment, ""You know, even though the thought of two girls kissing seems king of gross, the two of them make a really nice looking couple.""  I have to agree with her, they did at that.
I hope you enjoy the movie as much as we did.",971222400,5,2183,4.50379746835443

At this camp we meet 7 other ""inmates"", each representing some kind of homosexual stereotype. This is where she meets Graham (Clea DuVall) and begins to question her own sexuality.

Even though, the rest of America didn't enjoy this movie, because it wasn't released nationally,  but I saw it when it came out in NYC and I absolutely loved it. It's was a  cute satrical look at the coming of age gay girl in many middle americans,  that just don't know that they are. So the main character's mom sends her to  a camp to be straight again. This is where the fun begins. The camp is full  of different characters each portraying some gay stereotype one way or  another. Certain scenes will leave you chuckling to yourself or laughing  out loud. Clea Duvall is always an enjoyable sight, but she has to be  careful before she's type cast. She's already played a few lesbian  characters before. Natasha Lyonne was such a believable, closeted gay  character that you cant help, but laugh at her funny looks of confusion.  Rupal is hilarious and is great as a man as he is in drag and it was good  seeing him without the wig for a change, but the funniest character, Eddie  Cibrian, who plays Rock, a gay guy trying to be masculine for his mother,  Cathy Moriarty who is the head of the camp.
