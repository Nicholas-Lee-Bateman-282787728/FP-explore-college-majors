8637229,3,B00HXO3IGO,"A good movie, delivered in a timely manner.  The quality of the picture was lacking and I could only give it a C+ as it is very grainy for the most part and seemed to have been transferred from a VHS tape.  It is also a copy that was made from a TV broadcast as at one point, though just for an instant, you can see a logo for either AMC or A&E flash on the screen.  I was happy to get it, though, as this is a movie I have been wanting for my collection for many years.",1405555200,5,470,3.727272727272727
8637230,5,B00HXO3IGO,I have a bad vhs copy of this movie. George Raft was a terrific dancer and the rendition of the music Bolero was fantastic. I wish iy was available on dvd.,1403654400,6,155,4.032258064516129
