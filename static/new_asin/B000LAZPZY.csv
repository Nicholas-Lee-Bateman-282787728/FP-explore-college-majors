8160485,3,B000LAZPZY,"Most of the sights around the state were beautifully explored.  We meet the people and learn about the many aspects that comprise our massive state.

Sadly, like everyone else in the world, these producers seem to think that the only city in north Texas is Dallas.  Well, Dallas (as a Texas city) is a pretentious wannabe with very little personality.  Even the Dallas Cowboys are in Tarrant county (in Arlington on the Fort Worth side of the metroplex) now. The rest of the tour was decent but skipping over Fort Worth by only stopping in the Stockyards and moving on, essentially left out the city where the West begins. That includes Sundance Square (where Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid holed up) eight world class museums, Botanical Gardens, the Texas and Pacific terminal are just a few of the amazing aspects that this DVD passed by to visit Dallas where it has been said ""the East peters out"". Attention folks, ""Dallas"" was a TV show and a football team made it a household name but that TV show ended a long time ago and the Cowboys moved out.

As I mentioned earlier, it does alright with some of the other regions so for anyone but someone from west of Dallas, it is not a bad way to see Texas.",1249603200,,1209,4.502283105022831
