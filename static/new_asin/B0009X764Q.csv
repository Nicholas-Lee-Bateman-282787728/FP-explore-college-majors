2332970,4,B0009X764Q,"CHILLOLOGY is a three-part episode from the ""Goosebumps"" tv series. This three-part arc is notable for not being the only completely original ""Goosebumps"" tv storyline: it's the only episode not based on an R.L. Stine story or not written by R.L. Stine.

""Chillology, Part I: Squeel of Fortune"" - Jessica is a girl who is obsessed with money and making a fortune. She'll do anything to make money. When she finds a collectible model town in the attic of her house, she gets a telephone call from a man named Karl and soon finds herself sucked into the town. Karl wants Jessica to run a lemonade stand for him, but he warns Jessica not to get greedy. Of course, Jessica does get greedy and starts charging more and more money for the lemonade and watering down the product. Jessica is soon turned into what she already is in her heart. Of the three parts of this story-arc, this is the only one where one of the people being sucked into Karlsville actually has done something wrong and needs to be taught a lesson.

""Chillology, Part II: Strike Three...You're Doomed"" - Matthew Erickson loves baseball, but he's not a very good baseball player. After losing the last game of the season for his team, he shuts himself in his room. Soon he hears music playing and a voice calling his name. Matthew gets his chance to be a hero in Karlsville, but it's in a game of baseball never played before.

""Chillology, Part III: Escape from Karlsville"" - Matthew's younger brother Todd likes to enter sweepstakes. He soon finds a letter in the mail informing him he's the winner of the big prize in Karlsville. Todd gets to ride in the parade and give a speech before getting his big award. However, the award isn't anything like he ever imagined he could win. Jessica and Matthew have to return to Karlsville to rescue Todd.

In terms of ""Goosebumps"" episodes, CHILLOLOGY isn't bad. Part I is closest to a usual Goosebumps story. The arc of the story begins to change with Part II and by Part III it does turn rather frightening; this episode has a whole INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS feel, but for kids. If you're a fan of the ""Goosebumps"" tv series, this is a must-own, but if you're not, it's still a great one to watch.",1328572800,5,2211,4.547738693467337
2332971,5,B0009X764Q,"I live in Bloomington, a small Midwestern town and it looks a lot like Karlsville in ""Chillogy.""  This is a totally cool 3-part set.  ""Escape from Karlsville"" is the coolest.  The Plasto Blaster is totally rad, especially the sound effects.  King Karl Knave, Mayor of Karlsville The Plasto Blaster Master is an awesome super villain.  Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  R.L. Stine -- you rock!",1229212800,2,388,4.7727272727272725
2332972,4,B0009X764Q,"This wasn't the cream of the crop in Goosebumps episodes, but these 3 episodes were okay. I may be wrong, but these 3 episodes were never actually books, at least in the original Goosebumps book series. It shows in the layout of these episodes. There's just that feel that these were ""made for TV."" In any event, they're worth a watch if you're into Goosebumps. Also, if you're interested, please email me at pwherman@gmail.com for information on obtaining a complete 7 DVD-set of Goosebumps episodes.",1153353600,,501,4.905882352941177
2332973,1,B0009X764Q,"I bought this for my 2 daughters (3 & 7) who borrowed a goosebumps video from a friend and loved it. We bought 3 goosebumps episodes based on the reviews (Chillogy, Deep Trouble, Scary House). Chillogy was terrible. It was neither scary (in the goosebumps way) nor very interesting. It was really more of a super-weak attempt at a twilight zone episode for kids that I would guess was done to have enough episodes for a season. The other two Goosebumps were exactly what we expected. They were scary in a kid-friendly way and had stories that kept the kids engaged. I would highly recommend Deep Trouble & Scary House for younger kids. If you really want to check out Chillogy, rent it before buying.",1150070400,4,700,4.608
2332974,5,B0009X764Q,"I thought it was realy scary, I covered my eyes 3 times. I almost stopped breathing. I took the blanket off my face just in time for the best part. My grandfather kept telling me it was just a movie so that I would finish watching. That was horrifying terrifying but we liked it thanks.",1143072000,10,286,4.218181818181818

8069182,3,B0009X764Q,"eh not really all that scary. i never understood the light tone of this ep and why people think it is so scary. but i guess u have to put urself into the show and relate to what these kids r going through. so its like wow if i got turned into a pig and all these town people r trying to hurt me, im playing baseball  with tons of demons and im a kid where a creepy guy is trying to turn me into a plastic doll, then yes i guess that is scary lol. pretty much this is a 3 part ep story of a tiny man named karl who lives in karl's town, which is in a tiny model town toyset.  he brings kids into the model town and well torture them. to me instead of being spooky it seems more like trying to teach kids not to be greedy in life unless u want bad stuff to happen to u. so in a way karl kinda taught these kids a lesson",1415145600,,817,3.662857142857143
8069183,4,B0009X764Q,"The story is not the best, but my 6 year old son loves it. It is three episodes that are about three kids who get dragged into a model town called Karltown. Each episode is of each kid getting dragged in on there own and have to find there own new way out. Kids love it, but this is one of my least favorite and I love watching the old Goosebumps with my son. I do give it credit for having more than one episode with three whole shows on in.",1410998400,,442,3.868131868131868

8069185,4,B0009X764Q,"Im 23 i remember being a kid and i just found my old Goosebumps books and thougth hey maybe i can find a dvd. I did,and this one is one i picked up. I remember watching this as a kid and it brings good memories back to me,so i like it for that reason. When ive got time to burn i pack a bowl or roll a J and kick back on memory lane. This one right here makes me laugh. I liked it alot. I hope 1 day if i have any kids i can show em this and say yea i used to watch this when i was your age. Anyway i dig it,you should consider picking it up and you yourself as a kid watched it,maybe do the same as i did & let your kids watch it.",1379808000,,631,3.482269503546099
8069186,5,B0009X764Q,Because all of the goosebumps are good.  Watch the series on Tv is a good thriller love them all. A must see for all ages,1370476800,,121,3.84

There's no spanish track,no spanish subtitles, I am gonna dieeeee",1356048000,,155,4.571428571428571
8069188,5,B0009X764Q,"I purchased this set for my niece for Christmas. I used to love this show as a kid and thought it might still entertain a 7 year old. She loves this set and even reads the books. Not sure if it is suitable for most kids under 6-7 because of the scary nature, but you can guage your child's level of ""spooky"" tolerance. It is more like a Tales from the Crypt/Darkside for kids.",1347321600,,376,4.094594594594595
8069189,5,B0009X764Q,"The three-part Chillogy are my favorite episodes from the Goosebumps series, which are not based on any of the books or stories by R.L. Stine, but was based on an original concept.

It stars a young Caterina Scorsone as Jessica, a girl who loves to save her money, and to invest in a ""Sure Thing"", even if it means ripping off Matthew and Todd at their garage sale, or not loaning her brother money to buy their parents an anniversary present.

While searching the attic, she stumbles upon a realistic miniature town. Suddenly, Jessica is zapped into the town, where a strange character named Karl makes her an offer to make a lot of money. Let's just say things go wrong and she ends up dumping the town near the garbage cans.

Matthew and his younger brother come by and pick up the town. They take it home and set it up in their bedroom. After losing his baseball game, Matthew gets zapped into a town where he plays a deadly game of baseball. He barely escapes!

Then, Karl lures young Todd into the town. Matthew and Jessica must return to the miniature town to save Todd.",1346198400,2,1077,4.451776649746193
