2124830,5,B0002VEVQG,"If you like drama with supernatural themes then ""Witch Hunter Robin"" is for you.

""Witch Hunter Robin"" is a fascinating Japanese animation by Sunrise (of Cowboy Bebop and Gundam Wing fame).  I am not much into Anime, but this one was great. A cross between ""X-men"" and ""The X-Files"" with parts of the old TV show ""The Others"" and CJ Carella's ""Witchcraft"" thrown in for good measure.  A great tale of government conspiracy, occult themes, and witches. What is not to love about all of that?

Fifteen year old Robin is the newest hunter to be assigned to Solomon Toukatsu Nin'idantai (Solomon Executive Organization) - Japan, or STN-J.  Robin though  is different. Robin is a craft-user. A witch.

Now ""Witch Hunter Robin"" is different than most American fare. It is by it's nature, slower; it takes time to build up to the main plot. We need to see her reactions to the various day-to-day operations of STN-J. Like how she relates to fellow hunter Amon (is she crushing on him? does he want/need to kill her?), or what is the deal with Dojima anyway (great payoff there!). Or why she refuses to use the anti-Witch Orboro guns.

It lacks sex, T&A and some of the things that we have become accustom to on American TV, but the story is first rate.  I don't know much about anime really, but the visual style is fantastic. It is very easy to see this being remade as a live action drama.  The musical score is also reminiscent of ""the X-files"", haunting, dramatic and really just very, very good.

I highly recomend it and this complete collection looks fantastic.",1097020800,,1561,4.64
2124831,5,B0002VEVQG,"Hey,
This DVD collection looks pretty cool from what I've seen and the series itself is a MUST HAVE for anyone! The story is indescribably lovable and fantastic in every aspect. The show itself isn't the happy-lovey stories with a happy ending in some way, it is dark, but sheds that streak of light when necissary. The show also Has many twists and unsolved mysteries to it. Not all things have a perfect ending...",1096243200,,415,4.621621621621622

2124857,5,B0002VEVQG,"As the title says, Witch Hunter Robin was my first favorite anime, from way back when it aired on Adult Swim. So, I have a lot of sentimental attachment to it. I also love it for other reasons that I did not have back then (I was around 16 or 17, and I didn't think about much of anything; I'm much more observant now). In particular, it's NOT bombastic or obnoxious, and it is certainly not an action anime. I think this may contribute to why some people find it slow and/or boring. Overall, Witch Hunter Robin seems to me to possess a kind of graceful serenity and stillness that most people don't understand or value. The art and animation style, the acting (Robin in particular), and especially the music, greatly help to bring this out. On a related note, the normal and instrumental versions of the opening theme have been two of my favorite songs for years.

I've noticed a lot of people say that the voice acting is wooden, or just bad. However, if you listen closely, you will hear the nuances in the characters' voices. It's not always overt, but it's not forcefully subdued either. It seems very natural. Some of Robin's dialogue, particularly in the first episode when dealing with the owner of Harry's, does seem stilted. It was probably not intentional, but in hindsight, I think it makes some sense. After all, she's a newcomer to Japan, which has rather rigid rules of communication.

The bulk of the character development is given to Robin. Once again, it doesn't feel forced, or slow. Maybe her calm demeanor contributes to that.... When I watch the show, I always forget that she's supposed to be 15 years old. From the outset she's already more mature than many adults, which I like. There's no pandering or fan service in this show.

It also seems to me that the creators of this show did more than a little research on witchcraft and the occult. In the liner notes in the ""Extras"" sections on the DVDs, much of the witchcraft-related information mentioned in the show is expounded upon, which includes a little history lesson about the Salem Witch Trials and the Spanish Inquisition. It shows that there was love put into the making of the show. I also enjoyed the interviews with the Japanese cast, and I was pleasantly surprised the first time I watched the interviews that they also interviewed Taku Iwasaki (the composer for the series) and Bana (the person who sang the opening and ending themes). I was slightly disappointed that they didn't interview the English voice actors as well, though.

As I've grown and changed, I've found new things in Witch Hunter Robin to enjoy and relate to, and I love it now just as much as when I first saw it--maybe even more, which is a hallmark of an excellent show. In this sense, everyone has their own ""excellent shows"", so I don't intend that as an objective statement. As has been said, this show is not for everyone. But if it's your kind of thing, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1351382400,2,2957,4.61596958174905
2124858,5,B0002VEVQG,The series is a serious and slow but good one. It makes you think what if; maybe there are witches and some crazy conspiracy theory where the government tries to cover it up. If you like stuff like that this is your series.,1343001600,,223,4.209302325581396

im a fan of american comics and the maxx [wich there was more stuff like that!]

i grew up on speed racer and other imported shows so i thought hey why not check out some of this stuff thats supposed to be so great?

i gotta tell ya its realy pretty much just bubble gum for your brain after ya get back from a rave or something and your mind is out to lunch and your waiting to come down.. i myself used to dig the muppet show at 4am..lol

sence no one is writing anything from my point of view and i wish they had so i never would have spent the money i thought id do it for the next adult to come along...

its all pretty much intellectually devoid and highly offencive [and not in a good fritz the cat kinda way lol] and unless your mind is well warped by the stuff already it will most likely just get on your nerves...

2124873,5,B0002VEVQG,"This remains one of my favorite series. It, however, doesn't surprise me that there are negative reviews since it lacks a great deal of action and is slow to build up a head of steam. Rather than tell the viewer about Robin, her past, and her personality, large chunks of the early episodes are spent showing these elements and watching as the character grows from what she was into what she will be. That type of storytelling isn't for everyone. But it suits my taste rather well. I particularly enjoyed the soundtrack and how it was used to set the mood and color of the story. From the moment Robin arrives in the cab and we hear the deep brooding music with chanting voices, I was hooked and ready to sit and watch the entire series in a single outing. I make it a point to watch Japanese audio with subtitles because I've never been satisfied the English language voice actors deliver the same level of emotion as their Japanese counterparts.

All-in-all, if you like a slower pace to your storytelling and enjoy watch characters grow as the plot develops, you'll probably enjoy this series.",1316044800,,1096,4.62051282051282

2124875,3,B0002VEVQG,"I distinctly remember watching the first episode of Witch Hunter Robin online, and being quite intrigued by the basic story and the show's industrial neo-gothic aesthetics. Having finally watched the whole series, however, I have to say that I'm sorely disappointed. There's so much potential here, but I can't help feeling that the show makes at best a half-hearted attempt to develop it.

Characters? Robin herself is great. She's endearingly shy and sweet, quietly funny, and frequently badass, and is the only reason I gave this series three stars instead of two. Unfortunately, all of the good characterization seems to have been spent on Robin, because pretty much everyone else gets boring fast, particularly Mr. Grimly Brooding Amon. (To paraphrase a KotOR2 line, the whole sardonically cryptic routine isn't impressive; it's just melodramatic and annoying.) There's just not a lot of development here. Everyone but Robin is to a greater or lesser extent forgettable.

Plot? Meh. Again, lots of potential, but sadly little development. I just finished watching the show, and I really don't know much more about Robin, the witches, the STN-J, the Factory, or Solomon than I did in episode one. I can't stand it when a series that raises so many interesting questions plays coy like this and leaves them largely unanswered. Very disappointing.",1290384000,2,1349,5.211981566820277
2124876,1,B0002VEVQG,"I bought this collection from Amazon, which got it to me fast!

But when I went to play the first disc, it wouldn't work.  I thought that maybe it was some sort of protection that it couldn't play on a laptop.  So I put the disc into my xBox 360.  No luck.  Nor in a DVD player I had set up to try it out.  After VERY closely inspecting the disc, I found a small bubble in the imulsion over the disc's ID band just inside of the hole near the center.  I sent an e-mail to Bandai Customer Service and received no response.  After two weeks, I sent another.  After another two weeks, I sent another.  Needless to say, I still have the collection, but I cannot watch it because of the first disc being bad.

I have come to learn that most Anime series's start off with a simple story nothing real plot wise happening and then right around the 7 to 10th episode the whole thing changes. The whole plot changes, and your left wondering what is going to happen next. The graphics is good. I love the music, and am grateful that my oldest son introduced me to Anime and Manga. I wish and hope that our kids today will learn the lessons that are being taught in most Anime shows today. Good ones anyway. So kick back and watch a good show.",1238112000,,721,5.675925925925926
2124879,3,B0002VEVQG,"I usually give an anime about 5-10 episodes. This anime had some potential and I was hoping it would've lived up to it but unfortunately not.

The one major flaw that this anime has is that, well, it's just plain boring. It doesn't put you over the edge, it doesn't make you wonder much, and the fight scenes are just plain lacking and downright predictable. They just go in, do a little bit of fighting, but the bad guys just get caught many times in the most boring of methods...getting shot by their specialized which gun which acts just like a regular gun.

It is extremely dull and I'm on episode 10, I'm going to watch one more episode before I completely trash the series. Not worth it. Your typical anime themes and plots, but they really didn't try to go the extra mile to make it special. Sad.",1235865600,6,803,4.382550335570469

2124881,2,B0002VEVQG,"The picture (of Witch Hunter Robin) you see above is not what you get. Mine was a hard shell with individual disc holders inside. Nothing else...so to start with I was disappointed.
 I have only seen the 1st two disc but thought I would put up something to let people know about the mis-representation.
 The 1st disc starts out well enough and the anime is solid but it did not take long figure out that there is no underlying plot. Unless things change in the discs to come then each 20 minute episode is a story to itself. No working up to the Boss...nothing leads into the next story for the most part. For instance...50 evil little dolls... they only find 49..but the next episode has nothing to do with the missing doll. One bad guy gets away...but he is not in the next episode. I hope things get better the more I watch. At this point it is not very good. I will finish this when I finish the series.
  In discs 3-4-5-6 the story line is connected and progresses well and plays like one long story. That was a major plus compared to discs 1 & 2 yet because the first two discs are mostly a waste of time I could only give it 3 stars.
 While I did like it...it is hard to recommend due to the lack of action in most of it.",1222819200,2,1228,4.1645569620253164
2124902,4,B0002VEVQG,"Bought this maybe a year ago, watched it when I got it.  It was okay.  Some of the voice actors you will recognize from other popular anime.  I watched it again just a little while ago, again it's okay and my opinion didn't really change about it.  I don't know if I will watch it a third time or not though.  Some episodes are really good I do have to say that.  I think if I watched an episode a week, instead of watching like a DVD (or more) a day, maybe I would have enjoyed it much more, otherwise, IDK, maybe this just wasn't my cup of tea, I like witch movies and stuff like that, but maybe this just doesn't/didn't meet my expectations, I kind of thought it would blow me away, maybe like the way Berserk did.  If you are looking for something a bit twisted try that anime, it's a fantasy/horror Manga series.

Even though I may not have went goo-goo for this, you may really like it...",1217289600,,894,4.156976744186046
2124903,3,B0002VEVQG,"Witch Hunter Robin starts off as a ""monster-of-the-week"" type of series which is reminiscent of a cross between the X-Files and the X-Men.  It takes a little while for the plot to actually shift gears and get moving into a progressive storyline and it probably would have been better to move into the storyline a little sooner.  That said, it's still fun watching and once the plot does develop it gets pretty interesting.  Robin is not the most exciting or endearing character - I don't think this is a particularly character-driven anime.  What really moves this series is the story, the circumstance and the world it creates.  I would have enjoyed seeing a more clear exposition of the rules of their world (ie., what is the difference between a ""Witch"" and a ""Craft User"") since even towards the end I felt like I was still piecing some aspects together.

The animation is very pretty - if anything the characters and the settings are wonderful to just sit and stare at.  I had some issue with the subtitles - there were moments where I wasn't sure they were the best translation of the Japanese, even though they were not exactly dub-titles either.  The English dub can go from decent in one episode to pretty awful in another.  Despite the issues with the subtitles, I'd still watch in Japanese to get the best understanding of what is happening.

The box set doesn't look anything like the main product photo.  Another user uploaded photos which look like the set.  There are no extra papers (literally, no papers) in the set and it's basically just the dvds in a box.  This is fine for me but if you're looking for some sort of definitive  collector's set, this wouldn't quite fit in your collection. For the anime alone, I would give 3.75 stars, but because of this particular set and the issues I had with it, the product overall is more like 3 stars which is great for the casual anime fan.",1212883200,,1901,4.602373887240356

2124932,3,B0002VEVQG,"Witch Hunter Robin is an excellent anime that takes its time to get going, but eventually delivers a compelling story filled with numerous likable and unlikable characters. However, as a box set this collection is sorely lacking, especially when compared to other anime. First off the series itself:

Witch Hunter Robin tells the story of a teenage craft (magic) user who is sent from Europe to Japan to help the STNJ hunt witches. When she arrives she meets several shadowy figures, but eventually settles into the flow of things. The first couple discs are very formulaic. The STNJ parent group Solomon sends lists of witches to the hunters, and each episode involves the team defeating a witch with varying powers. If you only watch the first disc then you might get the feeling that Witch Hunter Robin plays out rather similar to many vampire hunting anime, and indeed, you could even say the first disc seems somewhat repetitive and cliche.

Things begin to pick up around the middle of disc two, when several witches appear whose goals and powers tend to be less evil and more undesirable. Robin begins to have misgivings about her job and the people who work with her. The third disc sees several twists that see Robin become hunted by Solomon and forces the remaining STNJ members to choose between loyalty to their friend or obedience to their betters.

The remaining three discs are best left to mystery, but it's safe to say that this series only gets better as time goes on. By the end of the series you really feel for these characters, who truly seem like people instead of anime stereotypes. Indeed, there are no angsty teenage boys lusting after large breasted women, gossiping schoolgirls or giant robots in Witch Hunter Robin. In this sense it is very unique amongst its peers, and in my opinion, much better. Personally I felt a little jilted by the ending, which fails to resolve all of the issues brought up in the later episodes, and cheaply explains others. Several characters are introduced in the final disc to tie up loose ends, and when the final credits role you may have the feeling that less time should have been spent in buildup and more time should have been spent in the actual mystery behind Robin and Solomon.

The discs include both English and Japanese language tracks as well as English subtitles. I had no issue with the dubbing. Some characters sounded a little wooden, and others were somewhat overplayed, but by and large the cast did an excellent job of bringing their respective characters to life. The soundtrack was also well done, if not as memorable as some other anime. Overall the audio package worked well and sounded crisp and supported surround sound systems.

One of the most important aspects of any animated work is the quality of the art and animation, and Witch Hunter Robin succeeds on the most part. Characters are designed well enough and Robin especially animates very smoothly. Seeing her walk very calmly towards an enemy, that determined look in her face, and such sureness in her movements, is quit amazing. The other characters all animate well, and express themselves effectively. I did find several times where the movement of characters' lips didn't seem to sync up to the English dubs, but I assume when listening to the original audio track this won't be an issue.

As far as the actual character designs go, I would label them as average. They aren't really anything special, and could be seen as rather plain actually. The same holds true for the backgrounds which mostly consist of mud colored city streets with very little in the way of distinguishing touches. Overall I would find the art to be the least appealing part of this package, but it is still more than effective at delivering the story.

Overall I would give Witch Hunter Robin 4.5/5 and have no issues calling it one of the best anime series I have seen. Still, a DVD box set is more than the content on the discs. Part of the reason one buys a box set is to own all the discs in a single appealing package. It is also expected, especially in anime, that a box set will actually come in a box, and most often contain cases for each separate disc. This is not the case for Bandai's Legends releases. Upon opening your package you will find a single large DVD case without any sort of extra box or printed material. Upon opening you will find inside 6 discs. That's it. No booklets, no posters, no artwork, memorabilia or bonus content of any sort. Heck, Bandai didn't even see fir to put in a pamphlet of its upcoming releases. Just to make it clear, this is no accordion foldout box, but merely a large DVD case with several plastic fold ups to hold all the discs. To add insult to injury, it seems that no time was taken designing the box art, which is downright offensive. At a list price of $50 I don't expect the same care that is put into designing the $180 sets, but seriously, fans deserve something more than, well, nothing.

Before I get asked this, no, my box did not have the brown outer cover shown in all the pictures. This was either omitted by Amazon or by Bandai. Either way if the box does not look like the picture than the picture should be removed.

Overall I would give the packaging a mighty .5/5, merely for including all of the series in working condition. Be assured though, this is the last time I buy something from Bandai's Legends lineup.

To conclude, if you wish to see Witch Hunter Robin in its entirety for an affordable price than this is the way to go. If you happen to be a collector who expects some sort of value for your $50 then you may want to pass on this and look for an alternative. Regardless of how you view it, Witch Hunter Robin is an anime not to be missed. It is a rare anime find with a perfect blend of action and drama, without the sappy love stories or epic robot battles. It's just a shame the package containing the series had to be so lacking.",1207267200,3,5940,4.584745762711864

Robin is very good at her work and her power grows. She soon is classified as a witch and the people she was working for now are hunting her. She can't trust her friends, lifes are sacrified, and dark secrets are revealed. It's a very good series. It's a little boring at first, but it get's really good and you fall in love with the characters. I recommend this to people who like mysteries, actions anime, witch craft, good dark storylines, and a small smudgen of horror and romance.",1203465600,,723,4.519083969465649
2124935,4,B0002VEVQG,"When this shipped, the first DVD in the set looked like it was boiled... some kind of manufacturing defect.
Needless to say I couldn't watch it but Amazon took care of it so I got a good copy of this...

Despite the media being bad and needing to wait a few extra days (while amazon shipped another) this was worth the wait.

I had caught a glimpse of this on adult swim (cartoon network) but never gave it much thought... Witchcraft has never interested me at all.

That being said... This is pretty fun material. A new twist on Salem Witch hunts of old in a pseudo version of our modern day world.

Robin as a character is very likable, if a little sad... there are tons of little things in this anime that make you believe the characters are real (and like them).

Robin drives this fun little Vespa around and plays with her glasses the way someone who got new glasses does... Many little things that bring this to life, and all the while having a story that deals with prejudice in a very entertaining and pretty original way.

In the spirit of ""to kill a mocking bird"" you get to see prejudice through two sets of eyes. (I won't explain how for those who plan to buy it. Just that it happens and you can see the injustice of it very quickly.)

All and all good stuff! I recommend it.

The story is well told, though some of the backstory becomes a bit muddled later in the series.  The characters are well portrayed and likable.  Basically the story revolves around a young witch hunter named Robin who is sent to join a team of special witch hunters.  There is a bit of repetitive plot elements: the evil, secret corporation with private army; main characters switch sides often; and the whole sci-fi twist towards the end.  Despite these cliches, the series does rather well.  Bravo on the music, it is not the best score, but the music fits the different moods of the various episodes.

Pros: Great visuals, good sountrack, engrossing story, likeable characters
Cons: Muddled backstory, repetitive plots, pointless 'witch hunting' episodes.",1196726400,2,998,4.863905325443787

2124940,5,B0002VEVQG,"People like to label other people. It makes life easier. Real people are complex, and sometimes they are scary. A label can be used to tie together a bunch of people and put them into a box. It gives a person a measure of control over their own fear.

The problems occur because labels lead to prejudice. You no longer have to think about real people - just the label. It's so much easier to hunt and kill a label, than a living, feeling human being.

""Witch"" is one such label.

In WHR, the team STNJ are charged with hunting down and killing witches - bringing them to justice. But the hunters have their own special powers - so what makes a hunter? what makes a witch? who has the power to decide the fate of a person, to label them of value to the world, or just another witch to be put to the stake?

If the labels are arbitrary - and where does that leave justice? STNJ hunts witches that use their powers to kill, but also those that do not. They are expressing the fear of humanity at what *could* become dangerous... someday, maybe.

Which makes you wonder - are these witches driven to become the way they are simply *because* of the rejection and persecution they suffer? And could there be one, last hope that will save them all?",1191110400,2,1241,4.309012875536481

I got it for christmas and all I have to say is this: It was worth the wait. I managed to watch the whole thing in 2 days and honestly even after that would gladly watch it again and again without ever tiring of it.

Robin is the kind of show that has a new surprise each time you watch it. There will be something that you missed that when you watch it you feel like you are watching for the first time even after 100 watches.

2124983,5,B0002VEVQG,"At the STNJ, a clandestine government organization, employees are tasked with hunting down and capturing witches and removing them from society. Ostensibly, this is to keep them from becoming menaces as they recognize and begin to use their powers.

When one of their own is taken away as a witch, a young Italian raised nun, Robin, is sent in as a replacement. She quickly proves adept as a hunter, and takes initiative in hunting, proving herself invaluable to the team.

Viewed as an action title, Robin seems episodic, with the ""monster of the week"" feel to it. But in watching this series carefully, you realize that, just as in the storyline, not everything is as it seems.

Witch Hunter Robin is an excellent Gothic mystery, full of symbolism, twists, turns, and clues.

Characters develop throughout,and not one is the same as when the character was introduced.

As Robin grows and changes through the series, she learns many things about the STNJ, her often shady co-workers, and her own mysterious past.

This title deals with witchcraft, a subject offensive to many. The initial portrayal is that all witches are evil and should be removed from society. The series deals with its own demons by demonstrating that there are many forms of evil that man visits on his brother, and addresses the paradox of fighting evil with evil. The characters themselves often struggle between what is good and evil when witchcraft is involved, giving the show a vividly realistic feel.

For those concerned with violence or nudity, there is violence, but it is not gratuitous, it is used only to advance the story by demonstrating the various witches' powers. There is no nudity. Robin is seen in the bath from her shoulders up from time to time.

This title is definitely worth seeing, again and again.",1163548800,22,1798,4.891447368421052

Try not to bash a show because you are not interested in it. Just say it wasn't your thing.  If you are impatient and need your fix right away, you won't like this series.  If you enjoy figuring out conspiracies, listening to dialogue and watching character interactions and development, then this is could be what you are looking for.

Here, we have Robin, a teenager trained in the mystic ""Craft"" arts by the Catholic Church to hunt down, well, witches.  When she is put on assignment and starts to go out in the field, she happens upon a few conspiracies that concern her past, her team mates and even the church whom she thought she could fully trust.

I thought this was good stuff.  True, the action isn't over the top like S-CRY-ED or Dragonball Z but for what the show is about I felt it worked.  The ending isn't so much a let down as it is set up for more to come, supposedly.  This is equivalent to more of an Indie/Arthouse film than a Hollywood Blockbuster.

From a male point of view - one who loved Rahxephon, Escaflowne and The Last Exile - the plot is agonizingly slow, astonishingly simple, and mostly devoid of intensity.

While there are a handful of very entertaining moments in the series, it is largely dull.  Too many times in this series nothing is actually going on in scene after scene.  If you get bored doing nothing, why watch anime about people doing nothing?  This series defiantly should have been 13 episodes but was stretched out to 24 for some reason.

I didn't like it; I found the plotline to be predictable and forced with a 'so-that's-it?' ending I hated.

The animation is top quality with lots of dark tones and the music is appropriately spooky.  Good visuals don't make up for bad story though.

Now, I have read many bad reviews and heard some awful comments about this, but they are all wrong.  Witch Hunter Robin is one of the best animes in the universe.  Believe me.  Do you like tall dark and handsome guys? !AMON =)! Do you like a alot of action?  A tiny pinch of romance?  I got to say that if it wasn't for my library I would have never have even heard or Witch Hunter Robin.  I never got into animes with guns, but I was hungry for a new anime and this was there staring me in the eye on a shelf.  After seeing this I saw Cowboy Bebop (by the same people who did Witch Hunter Robin).  It wasn't as good as Witch Hunter Robin, but it would still deserve 5 stars.
The characters are:
Robin Sena
Amon
Dojima
Miho Karasuma
Micheal Lee
Hotohori
Zeizen (Boss)
Harry (Master)
And many more...!!

Some people don't notice this sorta side story.
Amon is wary of Robin in the beginning, but  later he begins to warm up to her.  Zeizen is worried that if Robin does something to put the STN-J in danger, Amon won't report to him like he was ordered.  So, Amon begins to grow colder to Robin.  Until at last he begins to hunt her...

I've collected WHR in seperate DVDs, not the full collection, so im not sure what this particular set includes. However, i got the following with the first DVD/box in the set:

Shot Glass (little beer drinking glass is what i think they're for, the anime has alot to do with a certain bar/resturant called Harry's.)

Witch Hunter Robin T-shirt

CD Soundtrack (note: there are 2 seperate soundtracks as i found out later on).

Anyway, the anime is very well written, but like alot of different animes, it may be confusing at first, but once you get the hang of whats going on, the story flows really well. Things will start to clear up and ""story holes"" will begin to be filled in by the 4th DVD. If you like horror related animes, this one is deffinutly for you.

However it did so very slowly, and when it did, it was too little too late in my opinion. In other series like Cowboy Bebop, Trigun or Samurai Champloo, many early episodes unseemingly added small parts of a greater story which would unfold later in a powerfull way. I think there is too much hunting adding very little to the story in the first part of the series. The characters are well drawn but I think their personnalities and interrelations could have been more complex. The quality of the animation is top notch and the music is good. This was an OK series but I was dissapointed. For those looking for something similar but much better, I suggest checking out Full Metal Alchemist which has a very moving story, complex characters and presents deep interesting themes.",1145923200,11,932,4.689024390243903

The show has a great setting (great atmosphere and mood)...and it's a good mystery show. I was having sooo much fun with it and therefore expected a lot from the story (since there was lots of mystery and suspense) but I was pretty disappointed with the story....In genereal great show!!!",1134086400,4,578,4.676470588235294
2124991,4,B0002VEVQG,"Witch Hunter Robin is a great series which I enjoyed immensely but fails at delivering some of its finer qualities throughout the course of the series. The visuals are first rate, the music (when there is music) is beautiful, and the storyline is intriguing.

Silence and extended stares cloak the characters in mystery... so what's the problem? That same cloak covers the series in what could potentially be a series of yawns.

One of the major problems with Witch Hunter Robin is the pace. Many serious animes either take themselves too seriously or not seriously enough... WHR takes itself much too seriously. Surely the story and visuals are worth it but for some reason there are long, tiring sequences during the course of the series which are supposed to be ""meaningful.""

They are I suppose in retrospect (one will notice this once they watch the final episodes of WHR), but the events in the series do not warrant such extended periods of self reflection on the part of the main character(s). The psychological and philosophical themes present are obvious toward the end of the series, and where they are not, the intelligent viewer can pretty much guess at them.

I realize that this exhausted review of WHR seems to only be about the tiresome pace at which the series progresses, but it's an important factor as it leaves many to simply drop the series half way before ever seeing the later episodes (the best episodes in my opinion).

A second problem is also the fact that there are a number of ""witch capturing"" which take place during the series that seem... well, silly. The beginning of the series is all about these capturing - surely after seeing the last couple of episodes the viewer begins to understand how this ties into rounding out the characters but during the course of the series this might just bore you to tears especially if a number of episodes feature witch/enemies that simply don't interest you (which they may not, the creativity and design behind many of them is poor to say the least).

In the end the series is about the characters, story, and visuals not the enemies which frequently populated much of the series - if you find yourself hooked on the main characters and their back-stories when they are introduced in the beginning of the series then you might like the whole thing.

Lastly as for reviewers that were expecting something ""scary,"" most of the shows on Adult Swim are for adults and the anime shows featured on Adult Swim are geared toward those typically interested in other things beside quick thrills (needless to say those watching the series probably aren't into it because the name of the series is ""Witch Hunter,"" they are instead - hopefully - looking for a high quality, cohesive action/drama anime). This is not for individuals wanting to watch an action anime however... it's more of a beautiful drama. Younger anime viewers are not bound to like this one at all!!!

I have recently gotten into the shounen anime such as Inuyasha, Samurai Champloo, and Full Metal Alchemist. And I'll be honest, I much prefer the more boy-oriented anime where romance is second to the series and the story itself is the whole jist of the show.

This is what appealed to me for Witch Hunter Robin. Although more shounen then shojo, Witch Hunter Robin is a mixture of action, mystery, and suspense with a dash of romance. I enjoyed all the characters and was even surprised by the little twists and turns that pop out in later episodes. But what I love most about this series is that Robin is not a WHINEY, GIRLY, BRATTY 15 year old who always has to SHOW HER UNDERWEAR. She's in fact a mature young woman who is patient, and if not monotone, kind, and accepts responsibility.

This series has a Harry Potter meets the Matrix type blend. The witch hunting may bother a few (particulary Wiccans) but the overall message of the anime is positive. As Amon puts it ""God never forsakes his creations"".

2125006,4,B0002VEVQG,"Witch Hunter Robin is a 26 episode Japanese animation series set in the near future in Japan.  In this near future, individuals dubbed Witches who exhibit uncontrolled or psychotic manifestations of supernatural penomena are tracked and hunted by a shadowy international agency.  The title character, a quiet teenage girl raised in a European convent who posesses the ability to mentally start fires, works as a hunter for the Japanese branch of this agency (in the STN-J).  Some of the people she works with are up-front about their personal histories; others stay secretive.  The first half of the series focuses on Robin working within the STN-J to hunt other Witches.  Events halfway through the series lead to her becoming a fugitive; the storyline then delves deeper into several subplots concerning Robin's origins, the personal backgrounds of some of the secretive STN-J members, and the activities of the STN-J administrator.

This series is carried by its rich character development and its strong dramatic moments (which are neither forced nor overplayed).  The characters, even those who appear in single episodes, are defined deeply in a way that makes the watcher care about them.  The storyline slowly (but not too slowly) unfolds within single episodes and across the series as a whole.  An air of tension or mystery often permeates the plot.  Remarkably, this is all done with relatively little action (many action scenes merely feature people staring at each other while they duel with psychic powers) and with remarkably little nudity.  This is a strong dramatic series that holds the viewer at the edge of his or her seat with plotline, not with cheap thrills.

The animation style compliments the storyline very nicely.  Everything is cast in dark hues complimented with pale colors.  Faces, clothing, and architecture are highly stylized; much of it looks gothic or industrial.  A strong emphasis is placed on visuals, particularly visuals of individual faces.  While the individual characters and scenery are drawn technically well, the animators did have some problems.  Some scenes feature computer-drawn backdrops that look artificial, and cars for some reason are not drawn well when moving along the line of sight.  Despite these drawbacks, though, the animation still looks great.

The series only has two problems.  The minor problem is the soundtrack, which is somewhat lackluster.  The major problem is the predictability of the storyline.  In earlier episodes, when Robin is hunting other Witches, the writers leave little mystery as to who will be hunted at the end of the episode, even if it is supposed to be unknown.  Often, the hunted Witch is the one character that Robin or someone else in the STN-J interacts with during the episode.  The later episodes become less predictable, but a significant portion of the series's finale is disappointingly easy to infer.

I did not view all of the extras on the DVDs, but both the character/equipment overviews and particularly the cultural information were useful.

Overall, this is a very good anime series with excellent drama and characterization as well as a visually-pleasing animation style, although the predictable storyline and lackluster soundtrack inhibit it from being the best.  I recommend it to any anime, sci-fi, or fantasy fan.",1114992000,122,3327,5.228301886792453

The action is mainly low-key, but you get to see some awesome magic- especially as Robin discovers more of her gift.  There have been several reviews that talk about holes in the story, but what they didn't seem to understand is that Robin was raised in a convent and was trained that all witchcraft was evil and there's a differentiation between witchcraft and craft users.  There was no interaction between herself and the witches she hunted before her transfer to STN-J because witches were killed outright.  It's explained to her that STN-J captures witches instead... this is the same spot where you hear her disgust of ORBO. (in the 1st or 2cd episode)You then follow Robin through the realization of her powers, finding the true history of witchdcraft, and her struggle to find out if being a witch means you are inherently evil- especially herself.  At the same time you have the conflict between Solomon and STNJ over ORBO, the group dynamics of the actual teammembers of the STN-J, and their growing suspicions that all is not what it seems.  If you love untangling plots and a deeper story than most, WHR is for you!  If you prefer your plot on a silver platter... you might want to try something else.",1112572800,14,1449,4.673228346456693
2125008,5,B0002VEVQG,"Witch Hunter Robin, The Complete Collection is finally out. I've been waiting for a collection like this to come out since I seen all 26 episodes on Cartoon Network channel, on ""adult swim"". I was very very happy watching the whole series because I am a fan of action, anyone that is a fan of action would find this series excellent. It is a cartoon or anime which is Japanese animation but the characters, storyline is very real and watching it is a real adventure. It does not ""drag"" like some movies I've seen but maybe just a little bit. The characters voices are absolutely perfect for the characters. The only unfortunate thing is, is the ending is pretty dissapointing. I rather not say the ending to not spoil the series for anyone, but it is certanily I think the best anime ever made and I would watch it again!!",1112140800,4,822,4.486666666666666
2125009,3,B0002VEVQG,"I bought this collection at a sale for $75, so I figured that I might as well.  I have a mini collection of anime and i have watched my share of them, but this, by far, has been the biggest waste of money (anime wise).  I can handle crappy animation (Fist of the North Star), at least it keeps me busy until i find something better, but, crappy diologue with stupidity and monotone brakes my limit.  Their supposed to be a crime fighting agency, law enforcement, and yet Robin doesnt know that shes not supposed to take evidence from a crime scene.  Theres something wrong with the whole series; its hard to get attached to the characters unlike other animes and its actually easy to get anoyed by the main character (thats a first, for me at least)",1111017600,7,749,4.405797101449275
2125010,4,B0002VEVQG,"Have any of you ever seen La Femme Nikita? Ok, not the movie, the American TV show. Well, maybe I should explain. La Femme Nikita started as a French film about a smack addict who, with her other smack addict friends, knocks over a convienence store and kills the owner. She gets the death penalty. She is killed. She wakes up in a cell, and the secret shadow organization re-makes her from the skinny shaking junkie into the smooth suave killer they want. Jane Bond, in the beginning of her carreer... Why am I telling you this? Patience, grasshopper.

It was a terrific movie: ""My Fair Lady"" gone paranoid government killer. Anyways, hollywood thought it would be even better is everyone spoke English and hey, the lead should definitely be a blonde.  This was remade and renamed ... um... I forget.  No, really, I do. Anyways, in the end the main chickie redeems herself and doesn't want to kill anymore and runs away - leaves her friends at the secret org, leaves her lover that the org knows about, and is finally free. This is the sort of ending that cannot be made into a continuing TV series, so when someone decided to make this movie into a TV series they set it between the time she got caught and the time she left. And they turned the name back to La Femme Nikita, because the Hollywood name was not going to work out on a TV show of that sort of budget.  And I'm not talking about a big budget, despite the show being fairly decent.

So, now we get to the point of this little trip down memory walk of fame. The show, La Femme Nikita, was all about - get this-a girl in a super-secret organization with a broody good-looking boss who she cared about and who cared about her but they couldn't show it because, at first, he was just too cold; and besides, inter-office relationships are frowned upon; and later there were all sorts of secret agendas and plots twists and the org was very scary, ""If you leave us or betray us we will kill you and we'll only be doing it for your own good"".  And maybe the organization is good, adn maybe it's using evil methods, and ...  Super technology, etc, etc... wait, which show am I talking about again? Oh! I'm talking about Witch Hunter Robin, of course.

Anyways. It's very pretty, visually, and some bits -where Robin's playing with her new glasses -are awesome. But overall, it's very hard to understand. Something is lost in translation, I'm guessing. They try so hard to be inscrutable and obscure they obscure the whole dang plot away. Or at least, it moves very.... very.... sloooowly.

It could do with some comprehensable dialogue, that leads somewhere. There's such a thing as letting the viewer figure out for themselves what's going on, and then there's not providing enough information for anyone to figure out anything. This leans towards the second of those.

But it's a good show. It's got a good soundtrack, lovely visuals, and it's quiet; I appriciate quiet, especially when so many shows rely so much on obnoxious use of explosions and gunfire. It's ... the word is thoughtful. It's a thoughtful show where the characters are introspective and yet powerul. I do like it.",1110585600,12,3142,4.574733096085409
2125011,3,B0002VEVQG,"The premise, at first, is rather promising.  A young girl, Robin Sena, is sent to a Japanese branch of a witch hunting organization known as SOLOMON to... well... hunt witches! (Thus the name of the show for the less observant.)  The catch is that Robin, herself, is a ""Craft-user,"" which is a polite of  way saying ""Witch"" -- or ""hypocrite"" if you prefer.

Instead of  the usual spin on witchcraft and the occult, the show attempts to pull an X-Men in regards of explaining these magic wielding un-naturals. Don't get me wrong, there still are spells but it appears that only the likes of bonafide ""Witches,"" ""Craft-users,"" ""Sabrina..."" can manipulate the Celtic-esque spells to their desires.  The job of  STN-J, the aforementioned Japanese branch of SOLOMON, and Robin is to hunt down these unsavory criminal witches and send them packing to a scary place known as ""Factory"" where little green bullets called ""Orbo"" are produced. (Soylent Green? anyone?)

The first half of the series (episode 1-13) is very episodic as it tries to set up the basics of the show and introduce the main players.  One would think that 6  hours would be more than enough time to get the point across that SOLOMON doesn't dig witches while creating memorable characters, but it doesn't.  In fact, this half of the show plays out like an  hour version of CSI or The X-Files without the ""smartness"" required for an interesting investigation. (Since the ""investigation"" in this series usually revolves around Robin picking up a honking piece of evidence that everyone of the ""experienced"" team just-so-happened to ""miss."")

The lack of depth in the episodic stories, sadly enough, seems to be the strong point of WHR compared to the paper thin stereotypes that they pass off as characters.  It is hard to like or relate to characters whose entire personalities can be summed up with just a few adjectives.  For example: Robin is the ""new,"" ""inexperienced"" girl; Amon is ""tall,"" ""dark,"" and ""mysterious""; Michael is the ""greeky,"" ""unfashionable,"" ""couldn't-be-more-platonic-if-they-gave-him-a-goatee,"" hacker; etc.  It, at first, feels like the writers stuck some personality traits into a hat and then assigned them to a particular character, and never under any circumstance do they let them develop into anything more than just stereotypes. Other than a reoccurring and disturbing hint of pedophilia dashed throughout some of the later episodes, this cast doesn't get beyond the above adjectives.

Then, after the eclectic assortment of episodes that make up the first half of the show, you get to the last leg, which, sadly to say, is much worse than the first.  You remember those cardboard cutouts that passed for characters?  Well, this time around the writers decided to throw caution (and apparently anything redeeming about the show) to the wind and opt for a ""deep plot"" involving this waif thin cast.  The result?  A storyline that contains plot-holes large enough to drive a semi through and characters that seemingly disappear half way through the show.  You'll have to do even less thinking now to survive this series than you did before in order to maintain the delicate balance that was WHR.  Every ""surprise""  thrown your way could have been seen by episode two.  The Hunter becomes the Hunted, the Factory is revealed, and Robin, of course, is a typical Mary Sue who has yet to realize her full potential as a... Goddess!? (But we all knew that going in? Right?)  The only redeeming factor that the second half has is a blood relative of one of the main characters.

The artwork seems to be the only saving grace, and even that falters around episode 16 (which should be omen enough to scare the audience away from the second half).  The graphics, however, do manage to pick up again later on down the line.

Perhaps what made me the most disillusioned with this show is that it had potential, yet it never lived up to it.  The enjoyable ""campier"" episodes are few and far between the ones that take themselves more seriously.  The character moments such as Robin receiving her glasses or accidently ""blowing"" up the team are fleeting.

Witch Hunter Robin is alright at times and down right unbearable at others.  But, all in all I have seen worse... which isn't saying much...",1109116800,13,4274,4.932867132867133
2125037,5,B0002VEVQG,"Witch Hunter Robin is an acquired taste in anime-some dislike its visual style, while others rave about it, some find the stories flat, while others think the plot is brilliant. I think WHR is a more cerebral series than anything else. It has action, certainly, but much of the movement of the plot is between the characters' lines, and in their interactions with each other and the world around them. Robin herself is thrust into fighting people whose powers sometimes eerily resemble her own without knowing why. It is the process of Robin's self-discovery (and the ultimate revelations about herself, STN-J, Orbo, and more) that makes this series captivating. The unique character designs, beautiful artwork and animation, and brilliant soundtrack by the ever capable Taku Iwasaki are just icing on the cake. As I said in the title, this series starts slowly and ends on a very strong note, but the real beauty is in the journey between the two points.",1107216000,10,955,4.937888198757764

2125040,5,B0002VEVQG,"Witch Hunter Robin is a wonderful series, I thoroughly enjoyed all episodes. Some may find that the beginning of the series may be a bit slow but give it time and you'll see a better pace closer to the end. With this DVD set my likes were the special pin collection and haveing all DVDs in the fake book binding. My dislikes were not having the reversible covers of the single DVD volume covers. The DVD video is crisp and the sound is very good for 2.0 audio; both in japanese and english. This isn't something you get, watch once and that's the end. I found myself watching WHR again whenever I had the opportunity. For fans of WHR definitely get this set. For anime fans in general see the series first and then decide for yourself.",1104710400,8,735,4.372262773722627
2125041,5,B0002VEVQG,"I started watching Witch Hunter Robin when Cartoon Network added it to their Monday-through-Wednesday lineup on Adult Swim. The first few episodes were curiously slow, but after a while I found that I'd get antsy on the days when I couldn't watch it! (Even though I had Fullmetal Alchemist and Stand-Alone Complex to keep me busy!) So yeah, long story short: after seeing Episode 15, Time to Say Goodbye, I couldn't contain my excitement for how incredible the story line was, and I ran out to buy the box set - something I have never done on impulse before in my entire life. I even opened it in the car on my way home, that's how anxious I was... And I've never looked back!

I first came across this series flipping through the channels late one night, and was captivated by the somber mood and beautiful music.  The story can be enjoyed at different levels, but what I find most fascinating is Robin's search for herself, which is the story that spans the whole series. Don't we all go through that in life?  The story line is at a level that makes you think, rather than being spoon fed to the viewer, the way ""The Da Vinci Code"" was when I read it.  I only wish they had come up with a second season for this show.",1100908800,5,666,4.346774193548387
2125043,5,B0002VEVQG,Witch Hunter Robin has become a bit popular but I can see why is has great character devolpment a unique and intersesting plot and it is beatifully drawn.  When compared to most anime it dosent have that nickelodeon feel to it. It has been compared to the X-files in almost every review and yes it is a bit like the show except With Hunter Robin is  actually interesting.  But i don't agree with price anime is so expensive what a ripp off.  But we can always go with the import version it is somewhat more reasonable,1098316800,,517,4.354166666666667
2125044,5,B0002VEVQG,Witch Hunter Robin is an amazing anime!  I read the other reviews for it and saw people compaired it to X-Flies and such.  The very first thing that came to my mind when I saw Witch Hunter Robin...was how it reminded me of the Le Femme Nikita TV series.  The relationships between the characters...the characters themselves.  I can't even find the words to say how wonderful this anime is...but I wanted to give another perspective on a show it relates to.  :D,1098144000,2,460,4.560975609756097
2125045,5,B0002VEVQG,"Think of the X-files with witches and you have Witch Hunter Robin.  Robin is a young girl with some witchy powers, she has pyrokinesis.  She joins the STNJ, and orginization that hunts down witches and captures them, but does not kill them.  She seems to fit in with everyone but one person, who hates her powers and is afraid for everyone but shows it by not saying much and being pretty snippy with Robin.

This show is filled with more twists than M. Night Shyamalan could even think up for all of his movies.  If you want something serious, somewhat somber, and aren't afraid of dark and bad things happening to good people and mad twists galore, get this.

The only downside is the expensive price.  That is way too much to ask for what would really turn out to be about one season of a normal tv show on DVD not an entire series.",1098057600,3,835,4.348387096774194
2125046,5,B0002VEVQG,"If you like drama with supernatural themes then ""Witch Hunter Robin"" is for you.

""Witch Hunter Robin"" is a fascinating Japanese animation by Sunrise (of Cowboy Bebop and Gundam Wing fame).  I am not much into Anime, but this one was great. A cross between ""X-men"" and ""The X-Files"" with parts of the old TV show ""The Others"" and CJ Carella's ""Witchcraft"" thrown in for good measure.  A great tale of government conspiracy, occult themes, and witches. What is not to love about all of that?

Fifteen year old Robin is the newest hunter to be assigned to Solomon Toukatsu Nin'idantai (Solomon Executive Organization) - Japan, or STN-J.  Robin though  is different. Robin is a craft-user. A witch.

Now ""Witch Hunter Robin"" is different than most American fare. It is by it's nature, slower; it takes time to build up to the main plot. We need to see her reactions to the various day-to-day operations of STN-J. Like how she relates to fellow hunter Amon (is she crushing on him? does he want/need to kill her?), or what is the deal with Dojima anyway (great payoff there!). Or why she refuses to use the anti-Witch Orboro guns.

It lacks sex, T&A and some of the things that we have become accustom to on American TV, but the story is first rate.  I don't know much about anime really, but the visual style is fantastic. It is very easy to see this being remade as a live action drama.  The musical score is also reminiscent of ""the X-files"", haunting, dramatic and really just very, very good.

I highly recomend it and this complete collection looks fantastic.",1097020800,6,1561,4.64
