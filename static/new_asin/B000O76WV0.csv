8183366,5,B000O76WV0,"Really interesting character. Only bought this DVD because I saw it was set on a Train, Dads a bit of a Train enthusiast, what a pleasant surprises this documentary was. I don't buy many DVDs , and hope some of the profits find there way to john.",1425945600,,246,4.25531914893617
8183367,5,B000O76WV0,"First Jack Kerouac, then Tom Waits, and now ... Johnny Berlin. This melancholy portrait of a train porter who's dreams have been stilted by economic hardship is made in the tradition of the early films of Errol Morris, Les Blank, and Werner Herzog. The man in the porter's hat who is the subject of this documentary would be considered troubled by some, but he finds his way past his own demons by using the smokescreen of humor. In these times, Johnny Berlin is an imperfect hero with the perfect solution.

This is the first in a series.",1301616000,,539,4.556701030927835

8183370,5,B000O76WV0,"I found ""Johnny Berlin"" linked on Francis Ford Coppola's Web site (zoetrope.com) as one of his ""Zoetrouper films on DVD.""  So, I am in pretty good company when I say that this film by Dominic J. DeJoseph is poignant, entertaining, witty, and well worth watching.  DeJoseph is a masterful filmmaker and he selects his subjects with an eye towards the unique and unusual.  Paradoxically, these qualities are often to be found in the commonest of people and situations.  ""Johnny Berlin"" is no exception.  Watching this film for me was like opening a super-fresh bag of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups at Halloween and digging in: once I began to indulge, I couldn't stop; the scenes were that good.  I could relate to this porter, this Johnny Berlin, and his road trip through scenery and psyche.  Is he Everyman?  If so, maybe Everyman is weirder than we think.  Watch the film.  If you do, I imagine you will begin to know Johnny Berlin.  And your soul will be that much semi-happier for the experience.",1240531200,3,997,4.738372093023256
8183371,4,B000O76WV0,"I bought Johnny Berlin to share with friends after seeing it on the DOC channel. Although he's certainly not a movie star he has this dry way of stating the obvious - and is a lot of fun to watch. ""I'm semi happy - sometimes"" captures an essense of his demeaner. His slow delivery is great, as he isn't trying to trick anyone with his wit. He's merely showing that it doesn't take being a rocket scientist to get through this world. I love his idea of living small. Makes for a great adventure. Too many times we're fixed on having adventure on some grand scale for bragging rights. Often because of this we miss the beauty in everyday living. He's odd, but he's also honest in the character he's portraying. Fiction or non fiction - his way of making a buck through his little videos here are worth it. Entertainment at it's cheapest. I hope he does more, just for rainy days if nothing else.",1232841600,,893,4.385542168674699
8183372,5,B000O76WV0,"You may end up crying-laughing, but is there any shame in that?  This is one of the greatest character-portrait documentaries ever made, and it's also one of the funniest!",1209686400,3,171,4.896551724137931
8183373,5,B000O76WV0,"I viewed ""Johnny Berlin"" several times and each time it was just as enjoyable as the first.  If you love trains, you will especially enjoy this film.  The director takes you aboard a beautiful 1930's mahogany-interior Pullman-car train as if you just purchased a ticket for this great trip.  The intriguing conversation with the porter, Johnny Berlin, who has the ability to mesmerize you with his genuine on-going conversation and stories, will make you laugh, cry and utterly astound you.  You have to see it to believe it.  One person inhabits most of this film, Johnny Berlin.  You will be captivated as you watch this film.  You will feel as if you are actually riding this great train to its destination.  This film is an unusual and brilliant work of art.",1175040000,2,762,4.763358778625954
