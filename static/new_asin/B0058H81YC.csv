4598515,5,B0058H81YC,"Rowan Joffe's 2010 adaptation of Graham Greene's classic novel, originally filmed in 1947, has been updated to the setting of early 1960s England.  It is gripping from beginning to end, with superlative acting, writing, and cinematography.

The opening scene shows a gangster desperately making a phone call to one of his mates.  He is on the run, and there is nowhere to hide.  Before a fellow gang member can get there, the rival gang has killed him.  Young Pinkie Brown, portrayed by the impressive Sam Riley, arriving on the scene, knows his life has changed.  Events have forced him to make a decision - should he take the helm of his gang?  A following scene shows his hesitancy in killing the man who killed his boss.  At that point, he can't quite muster the determination, and anger, required to kill his boss' assassin.  That soon changes - he grows into the role he has assumed for himself.

He also has to deal with a possible witness to a crime he and another gang member have committed.  The witness, a young woman named Rose, who just happens to be in the vicinity of the crime, saw Pinkie and a fellow gang member as well as the member of the other gang who had killed their leader.  Shortly afterward, Pinkie and Spicer, his mate in the gang, kill the other gang member under the boardwalk.

Rather than risk her telling her story to the police, Pinkie decides to ""romance"" her.  Romance, however, is an inaccurate word for his intentions - he simply wants to prevent her from talking.  The scenes detailing their emerging relationship are a bit hard to accept.  Pinkie shows little affection or humor in their interactions. One gets the feeling that he has scant ability to show emotion to anyone, and little experience dealing with women. As for Rose, she's either completely naive, or just a tool for the screenwriter to advance the plot.  In any event, she becomes completely caught up in her love and devotion to him.  The story develops in a unique manner, with both the climax and the ending far different than one would have been led to believe.

Although far different than what American audiences would think of as a thriller, Brighton Rock is as enthralling as any movie of its genre in recent memory.  The acting - by Sam Riley in the part of Pinkie, Andrea Riseborough as his girlfriend, Helen Mirren as a shopowner involved with one of the players, and all others - is superb. As an ensemble, one imagines their being worthy of undertaking the most difficult stage play.  This is a film to watch again and again.

I've also read that Sam Riley is portraying the Jack Kerouac alter-ego, Sal Paradise, in an upcoming release of On The Road.  He certainly looks the part, and based on this effort, I'll be eager to see the film.",1325030400,18,2756,4.613963039014374
4598516,5,B0058H81YC,"This was hands down the best movie I have ever seen! I have not read the book yet, but I plan to do so! I LOVED this movie!!!",1318118400,,125,3.5
4598517,5,B0058H81YC,"This movie is a love story, set in mid-20th Century Brighton Beach, U.K.  While I found the film noir and threatening atmosphere difficult, I would say that portions are characteristic of the day, late 1950's.  The quality of acting is of course outstanding.  It seems very realistic and a gritty portrayal of men of the day, their relationship to women and to the expression of their own emotional feelings, with an uplifting and yet uncertain end.  The film suggests the dichotomies of human emotion and behavior.  The character of Pinkie demonstrates aggression and violence, yet with a suggestion of uncertainty.  And, is he manipulating Rose or does he really love her, or both?  Is he in control of his actions, or out of control, or both?  Differing emotions and motivations can play out side by side.  Rose's strength comes from being able to see a portion of the man behind Pinkie's mask.  This love story plays out within the context of dark, violent, English street life that reminded me of Dickens, the battles of rich and poor, generational power struggles, and youthful anarchy.  And, the end was reminicent of the Irish film, ""The Magdalene Sisters"".  Anyone with fantasies about the 1950's should see this film.

I have to say as well, that I have come to trust the choices made by Helen Mirren.",1315008000,,1311,4.825112107623318
4598518,4,B0058H81YC,"BRIGHTON ROCK  is a British remake of the 1947 brilliant film noir based on the novel by Graham Greene an adapted for the screen by Graham Greene and Terrance Rattigan. This BRIGHTON ROCK has been updated from the original 1930s setting to the 1960s and the screenplay is by Rowan Joffe (who also directs) - tough competition with the original writers!  The result is a dark film that relies on performances by some actors who are not up to the task and makes them seem even more weak by the presence of such brilliant actors in smaller roles as Helen Mirren,  John Hurt, Philip Davis and Andrea Riseborough.

The story takes place in 1964 in Brighton, once a quiet seaside town, is suddenly overrun by gangs of sharp suited Mods and greasy Rockers looking for a riot. Looking to be the top Mod gangster, Pinkie Brown (Sam Riley) will stop at nothing to be the biggest name in the crime world - bigger than the competitor Colleoni (Andy Serkis). Pinkie witnesses the vicious death of fellow Mod Kite (Goeff Bell) and is determined to kill the perpetrator Hale (Sean Harris).  Pinkie's ruthless and violent ambition takes over his mission and when he discovers that a waitress named Rose (Andrea Riseborough) who works at Snows, a cafe run by Ida (Helen Mirren), is involved tangentially in the murders,  Pinkie decides to court the plain jane Rose, knowing that if he marries her she cannot testify against him should she discover Pinkie's guilt in the murders.  Ida had a 'connection' with Hale and sees through the veils of deceit Pinkie is placing on the innocent Rose, and she and her longtime friend Phil (John Hurt) undermine Pinkie's plans.  Pinkie marries Rose - a gesture that secures Rose's fascination and new love for Pinkie -  to keep her from testifying against him.  As factors around the conflicts between the two gangs tighten and Pinkie fears for his end, he convinces his new bride to take part in a mutual suicide, an act that has a surprising end.

What is missing in this updated adaptation is Graham Greene's important emphasis on the theme of sin, guilt and Catholicism: there are attempts to bring these concepts into the script but they become of lesser importance than the action and dark evocation of a period piece.  There mood is well described by the cinematography of John Mathieson, but the single most effective aspect of this film is the brilliant music score by the gifted British composer Martin Phipps, godson of Benjamin Britten.  Were there not an original film for comparison the film would likely be better accepted. But for those who are ardent fans of the novels of Graham Greene this film adaptation will likely disappoint.  It is currently available On Demand and simultaneously in theaters before the DVD is released here. Grady Harp, September 11",1315008000,4,2794,4.79375

4598525,2,B0058H81YC,"So many ideas went into Rowan Joff's adaptation of Graham Greene's 1938 novel about sin and damnation, and so many of them were bad ones. The major one is that he sets the story in 1964 rather than the original date, which might not be so terrible given that the famous John Boulting film version of this novel was set in its own present-day of 1948; however, Joff had the absolutely horrible idea of inevitably accompanying this change by bringing in the riots of the Mods and the Rockers, and when the hordes of Mods in their Vespas start chanting ""We are Mods, we are mods"" during the killing of Spicer, it's impossible not to think of QUADROPHENIA--a jarring comparsion that is heightened even further by having several important scenes in this version take place (for no good reason) on the nearby cliffs of Dover. Joff has been accused by some critics of having drained all of Greene's vision of Catholic guilt from his adaptation, but actually it's been cheapened rather than drained out. Instead of allowing much talk of Greene's Catholic themes, Joff pours over the action a solemn and piping boy's chorale, that instantly makes everything seem depressing and portentous. You'd never know that Graham Greene originally classified the book (with its love of popular culture, beautifully evoked by the Boulting version) as an ""entertainment"": you feel instead you're at a dolorous requiem, and it goes on forever. There are some nice visual touches from time to time, but the film is pretty much a failure. As Pinkie, Sam Riley seems too much like Dickie Attenborough from the previous adaptation (and suffers in comparison with him), and the excellent Helen Mirren is too forceful and in charge to bring the element of surprise to the key role of Ida that Hermione Baddeley brought it.",1355529600,5,1793,4.862745098039215
4598526,2,B0058H81YC,"I read this book years ago when I was Pinkie's age, living in England, though not in Brighton.  I was clumsy and stupid, very mixed up about what it could mean to be a man, mean and careless. I knew about guilt because I'd been brought up as a Catholic, though I'd long since stopped going to confession. I felt that I understood Pinkie, his anger and frustration, and his conceit.
When they made this movie they set it at the time when I read the book, among mods and rockers, at the beginnings of the sixties.
  Since reading Brighton Rock back then, I've read other books by Grahame Greene and have been amazed by his ability to burrow into a particular time and place and construct a rich narrative about characters and morality.
  So, I've been looking forward to watching this movie for a year or two.  The movie does reference Catholicism, does have a few things to say about what is right and wrong, and does touch on what it can mean to be an amoral young man. And there are Mods and Rockers.
  But it doesn't add up. Instead of looking to Grahame Greene who was able to knit all this together,the movie makers have borrowed everything they could lay their hands on from the genre of the modern British gangster movie.  If you like you can watch John Hurt and Helen Mirren, but all you will see is them doing a decent job, nothing more.
  The only reason to see this movie is to watch the actress who plays Rose. Andrea Riseborough has an impossible part, a sweet girl who falls in love with a psychopath.  She does a great job and somehow she makes this movie faintly plausible.",1352419200,2,1588,4.382252559726963
4598527,3,B0058H81YC,"""Brighton Rock,"" (2010) is, apparently a British television treatment, the second adaptation to be made, of outstanding British author Graham Greene's classic, early career, downbeat novel of the same name,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brighton-Rock/dp/0099478471/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brighton Rock</a>.  This 111 minute full-color romantic crime drama/thriller, for which I see a BBC Television production credit, was the film debut of Rowan Joffe (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Weeks-Later-28-Days-Later-2-Movie-Box-Set/dp/B000TJBN8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Weeks Later / 28 Days Later (2-Movie Box Set)</a>), who both adapted for the screen and directed.  It draws upon film noir and gangster elements from its predecessor, and did receive a theatrical release.

The production has been moved from the Depression 1930s, in which it was written and set, to the fraught 1960s, during which, in Britain, sharp-suited Mods and greasy Rockers were frequently at each others' throats.  It is, of course, still set in Brighton, once a quiet seaside resort town, with some historic artifacts and buildings from the days when it was a favorite royal resort.  Mod gangster Pinky Brown, survivor of a rough childhood, has witnessed the vicious death of fellow Mod gangster/surrogate father Kite at the hands of Hale, member of an opposing gang.  So Pinky makes it his business to execute Hale.  But the none-too-bright Rose, who waitresses at the local tea room, Snow's, has been immortalized in a shot by a boardwalk photographer of Hale and her that shows Pinky following Hale, just behind his prey.  Older and wiser heads in his gang advise him to romance and seduce the waitress, in hopes of preventing her telling the police what she saw.  So Pinky begins on this program, which he finds rather distasteful.  But, unfortunately, he has been destabilized by recent events; he will become more desperate and violent, and will begin to act out in ultimately self-destructive ways.

The film is a little off-balance, as the young lovers are played by rather inexperienced actors, Sam Riley (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Control/dp/B00000FZL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Control</a>), as Pinky, and Andrea Riseborough, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/W-E/dp/B007Z9QWVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">W.E.</a>), as Rose.  Several older, stronger, more experienced actors are in smaller parts.  Oscar and Emmy winner Helen Mirren, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Queen/dp/B006RXQ2CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Queen</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prime-Suspect-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B0028AEO0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prime Suspect: The Complete Collection</a>), plays Ida, Rose's boss at the tea shop.  John Hurt, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00498VS1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>), plays Phil Corkery, local publican.  Andy Serkis, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Motion-Picture-Trilogy/dp/B0026L7H20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy </a>), plays Colleoni, rival mob boss.  And solid supporting actor Phil Davis, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Chapel-The-Ripper-Returns/dp/B005G172Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Chapel: The Ripper Returns</a>), plays Spicer, older member of Pinky's gang.

And this 2010 adaptation is often compared, to its detriment, to the brilliant 1947 black and white adaption that starred a young Richard Attenborough.  That one was adapted for the screen by Greene himself, and noted playwright Terrance Rattigan, and is considered a film noir classic.  But the earlier film is hard to find.  Nevertheless, the more recent version is still a dark film that gives the viewer a good sense of Brighton at the time.  Its mood is well transmitted by cinematographer John Mathieson, and it receives enhancement by the atmospheric score by the gifted British composer Martin Phipps, godson of esteemed British composer Benjamin Britten.  The newer version is distinctly light on Greene's recurring themes of sin, guilt, and Catholicism, as compared to its print inspiration; it has also been given a happier Hollywood ending.  Still, it's likely this remake would have been better received if the 1947 version weren't available for comparison.  Worth a look-see.",1348099200,4,4666,7.060763888888889

4598530,2,B0058H81YC,"I saw the original 1947 film a few years back.  I was not impressed.  It was slow in parts, disjointed and carried on the shoulders of a poorly asserted performance.

There is really no difference between that film and this current adaptation.

I had the same issue with this premise as with the original.  From my review of the '47 film: ""I found it a struggle to get on board with the films actual prose, which I found to be ineffectively constructed.  The idea of a hoodlum marrying a girl he loathes just to drive her to suicide so she can't squeal on him for bumping off a rival is far fetched and really needs serious innovation used to give it even the remotest air of honesty.  I mean, if he was so willing to kill a man why wouldn't he kill the girl?  It just doesn't make sense, and I don't get the impression from `Brighton Rock' that it wanted us to suspend disbelief.""  I feel the same about this version.  There is nothing here to make this seem plausible.  It just feels rather pointless.

There is the same batch of positives here.  The cinematography is lush.  The supporting cast is mostly good.  Andrea Riseborough is stunning and captures the naivety of Rose beautifully.  The final scene, with the record, is nowhere near as effective as in the original, so she loses that big moment that Carol Marsh chewed up marvelously.  Helen Mirren, who knows how to chew, is uncomfortably reserved here (I wanted her to push this but she seemed almost bored) and Sam Riley is horrible, but I really hate the character of Pinky.  He makes no sense and I don't think it's possible to `act' this character without looking stupid.

At least it's a pretty film.",1331856000,4,1667,4.496666666666667

4598532,5,B0058H81YC,"I was really surprised by how much I liked this production of Brighton Rock. As any Graham Greene fan knows, good adaptations of his novels are hard to come by. In film adaptations, the real marrow of what Greene fleshes out in the novel is missed. In his earlier novels, that usually is Greene's inextricable belief in God and his obsession with the power of belief, especially in regard to Catholicism. This production misses that in a general sense. Lip service is payed to the Catholic connection, yet the film manages to convey those themes of damnation and salvation all the same. Sam Riley's truly young and innocent looking baby face coupled with his bone chilling performance as the ruthless gangster Pinkie entirely steals the show from this production's formidable cast. Andrea Riseborough plays a splendid Rose. John Hurt and Helen Mirren support the film with flawless performances from both veteran artists.

There are plot departures from the book. And not all are minor departures and these may upset you if your a purist.

4598535,4,B0058H81YC,"I greatly enjoyed the movie although I think the 1947 version was better if you are looking for ""film noir"" (not just literally!). The update to 1964 in the setting was interesting and permitted some new interpretations, although the ""mods and rocker"" injection adds nothing in my view. Also, the 2010 release allowed more explicit treatment of some of the subject matter than was possible in 1947. This is especially the case in the ""romance"" between Pinkie and Rose: the evolution of their relationship in the movie is the most interesting part of the the whole thing and in 1947 they could not of course portray explicitly the sexual side of it as they did in 2010. The 2010 portrayal of their ""romance"" is more conflicted than the 1947 version, which shows it rather clearly as a self-serving tool for Pinkie's manipulation of Rose. Since I personally think Pinkie is mentally too disturbed to be capable of any love, I vote for the 1947 interpretation. But if you listen carefully to the bonus material on the DVD version, it is interesting to hear Sam Riley (who played the part of Pinkie) make a remark which is distinctly at odds with the Director: Sam Riley says he can't honestly see any love in his portrayal of Pinkie's relationship with Rose, although the Director (curiously) describes it as a ""love story""!.",1327536000,,1322,4.777292576419214
4598536,5,B0058H81YC,"From the ominous, opening foghorn, this film is dark and foreboding. It is supposed to be. Rowan Joffe directs this remake of the classic noir crime drama, directing his own script adapted from the Graham Greene novel of the same name.
The story centers around the character of Pinkie Brown (played by Sam Riley), a rail-thin, fair-haired gangster who doesn't just happen to be Catholic; being Catholic is central to his understanding and perpetrating of evil. He's a menacing thug who has lost his father-figure, the leader of his gang, murdered by a member of a rival gang. Pinkie is coping with this but also with the ramifications of his having murdered the murderer, in revenge.
Pinkie's facial expressions are a mix of the vacancy one associates with sociopaths, and a sneer. Once the revenge murder is done, the three other members of the gang insist that Pinkie obtain the only evidence that could link them to it: a photograph taken on the boardwalk by an innocent vendor, given to an innocent girl. Pinkie befriends the girl, Rose (played by Andrea Riseborough), obtains the photo, only to realize that she already knows too much. So, he woos her. He courts her. The audience can plainly and painfully see that Pinkie despises her, is only using her; but Rose, innocent as she is, believes this is true.
""I love you, Pinkie. I would do anything for you,"" she writes to him one day on a postcard - to his disguised disgust. He almost tears the card in two and tosses it into the waves of the roaring sea, until he realizes that the sentiment might later be of some use.
They are both Catholics. ""I'm a Roman, too,"" Pinkie tells Rose on their first date. ""I used to be in the choir.""
""Do you go to mass?"" she asks him. He shakes his head, no.
""But you believe?"" she asks.
""Course I do,"" he says. ""It's the only thing that makes any sense."" And then he tells her that hell and damnation are what makes the most sense to him of all.
Ida (played by Helen Mirren) is a waitress in the novel but a manager of waitresses in the film, and dedicates herself to punishing Pinkie down for the murder. The man Pinkie murdered was a friend of hers. Ida is far more promiscuous in the novel than in this film; Joffe has made her secularly respectable whereas Greene made her only spiritually so. And Ida's secular religious view, central to the original story, is lost here. The narrator of the novel tells us that Ida and Pinkie have different views of death and life: ""Death shocked her, life was so important. She wasn't religious. She didn't believe in heaven or hell.... Let Papists treat death with flippancy: life wasn't so important perhaps to them as what came after; but to her death was the end of everything."" Pinkie, the killer, was just such a Papist. He committed a mortal sin and knew it. Ida knows it, too, but there seems to be nothing she can do about it.
In his efforts to keep Rose quiet, Pinkie is soon negotiating with her father, a despicable man, to marry her. He ends up paying the old man 150 quid. At least her father looks shamed as he counts the dough and Rose looks from the hallway. Pinkie and Rose marry, but not sacramentally. No priest, no mass.
""I was late because I went to church,"" she tells him as she rushes into the courthouse, ""to ask forgiveness.""
Pinkie takes Rose aside - with kindness or menace, it is tough to tell - and tells her: ""You've got to understand: this isn't a real ceremony. This is sin, Rose, mortal sin. There'll be no good going to a church ever again."" As they wed, Rose stands before a window with a ray of light upon her; Pinkie is all in the shadows.
The screenplay follows the plot of the novel fairly closely, and it resembles the legendary 1947 film (co-written by Greene himself and, as of this writing, available for free viewing on YouTube in six parts) it is remaking. Joffe, however, decided to change the setting to 1964, rather than the years between the wars. This allows him to bring hippies and sixties craziness into the story, as well as a toss-off line from Ida to Rose about hoping that Rose is on ""the pill."" Greene would have liked that.
But ultimately, there's little religion in Joffe's film, far less than in the novel. What for Greene was a story about the possibility of love coexisting with evil becomes, for Joffe, an anti-love story. A moment when Pinkie attempts to pray while being hunted by members of the rival gang is short-changed to the point of being confusing, and other religious elements are only hinted at, never explored. But in the hands of John Mathieson (Gladiator, The Phantom of the Opera), the cinematography is gorgeous. And the soundtrack, created by Martin Phipps (Harry Brown), will remind some of The Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons with its alternating silences followed by soaring voices and strings.
I regretted the absence of religious themes in the film and urge you to read the novel before watching it. The first and most important theme is evil - its real existence, and the notion that only those who believe are able to truly perpetuate it. A Catholic can perpetrate evil far more effectively than a non-Catholic, so clear is the teaching of the Church on the subject of sin. So, accountability is conjoined with evil.
The second religious theme is the notion that there is some goodness - what a theologian might call evidence of the Imago Dei, in all of us. Even in Pinkie? This one is mostly lost by director Joffe; perhaps he was attempting to create a less Catholic picture.
You may remember the most quotable line from the novel, spoken by the priest who hears Rose's confession (although she claims that she didn't come to confess anything) after the death of Pinkie. She claims not to be worried about damnation or the future. He nevertheless offers her hope: ""You can't conceive, my child - nor can I or anyone - the appalling strangeness of the mercy of God."" Well, the line is here in the film, as well, only without much of the context that gives it sense.
I shouldn't tell you how it all ends, but let it suffice to say that this excellent remake ends just as the 1947 version did, with a final scene that famously alters the ending of the novel. As the camera affixes upon a crucifix hanging on the wall, Rose plays a recording of Pinkie's voice, a recording that he made in a private booth along the boardwalk, after Rose urged him to ""tell her something."" She wanted to know that Pinkie loved her but what he really recorded was something awful. As Rose plays it back after his death, something happens - a fluke, really - that leaves her with hope that there is good in her love. Indeed, there is good in all of us, and forgiveness is possible, even (or especially?) for those who seem most willing to be damned.

8461552,2,B0058H81YC,"Graham Greene's 1938 novel about a sociopathic young British thug and his co-dependent girlfriend receives an uneven treatment in this modernized film adaptation. Solid acting (especially from Helen Mirren, Sam Riley, and Andrea Riseborough) goes a long way to making this low-budget indie feel more substantial than it deserves to be. But an updating of the plot to 1960s mod England contributes to a general feeling of cognitive dissonance, as surreal sequences overshadow period details in a story where nothing really seems to fit.

The film looks gritty, but suffers from a lack of internal narrative logic in adapting Greene's material to the screen. Minor characters who initially seem important play no clear role in the story, but serve only to distract from the main events. On that score, Andy Serkis is just weird (neither menacing or particularly relevant to the plot) as Brighton's friendly local mob boss and John Hurt is wasted in a small role that constantly threatens to be more significant than it turns out to be. Maurice Roeves (""The Last of the Mohicans"") shows up in a welcome role as the local police inspector, but vanishes after just one scene. Plotting is convoluted, with the initial murder sequence being introduced in a confused way and the motivations of characters (just why the heck does Mirren's restauranteur get so involved to the point of putting her own life at risk?) remaining sketchy at best throughout the proceedings. Mirren's part, despite being so integral to the film, feels particularly underwritten as we strive to understand how her character evolves from a cafe manager into an amateur detective who demands interviews with local mobsters. Without any context or background for her character, her behavior as a one-woman force for justice just comes across as bizarre.

Rowan Joffe directs the flick with a taut contemporary feeling, bringing out some of the novel's religious overtones more than the classic 1947 film version that starred Richard Attenborough. Both spiritually and physically, he also makes some of the scenes more genuinely disturbing (Riley's lack of affect is genuinely creepy!) than the original movie, pushing an agnostic take on the material that is far more anti-Catholic than Greene's original work. However, the dated switchblade battles in mods-and-rockers trappings feel almost comical in comparison to contemporary film gun battles, providing a continual reminder that the stakes of this story are much lower than the movie wants to make them. And Joffe's agnostic take on the book's religious themes, alluding to them just enough to imply that Catholicism can make people crazy, leeches the story of Greene's religious debates which are so essential to the novel's nuanced-but-loving critique of his own faith. Greene helped script the 1947 film version of his novel, but he clearly had nothing to do with this one.

Instead of a crime drama that explores deeper questions of religious morality, Joffe ultimately reduces Greene's richly complex novel to a ho-hum thriller with some religious trappings. There's nothing wrong with this approach except that it's not particularly involving. Like the 1999 film version of ""The End of the Affair"" with Ralph Fiennes, this version of ""Brighton Rock"" is a two-star production all the way, mixing flourishes of brilliant acting with cheap shots at Catholicism that strive too hard to make the material palatable to more contemporary secular sensibilities. A truly great 21st century film adaptation of Graham Greene's ""Catholic novels"" remains to be made.

The DVD disc is unremarkable and includes no extra material. This 2010 film was later released by IFC in the United States to select theaters and direct-to-video in 2011. Originally a BBC Films co-production, it feels more like a movie of the week than a motion picture.",1428624000,2,3851,5.226537216828479
