3497759,1,B001BPD4T2,"I ordered this set hoping to get a true picture of the Vietnam war, but I should have known better than to expect anything like that from Time Life. Just like Walter Chronkite's left wing reporting during the entire war years, Time Life has given us a war prospective from the smiling, laughing faces of General Giap on down to the VC. The whole idea of the set is to portray that the poor Vietnamese were just trying to unify their country, and that the big, bad Americans were stopping them even though the South wanted to join the North. The only people interviewed in the set (other than politicians)were Communists, anti-war Americans, and Americans that had guilty consciences about some ""atrocities"" they committed. Nothing was said about the Vietnamese atrocities to both Americans and to any Vietnamese that didn't go along with the Communists. This whole set was nothing but a left wing expose on the war without any equal time given to the right wing position. I regret spending the money on it and will never again buy anything from Time Life.",1230336000,25,1055,4.739130434782608

Thanks dad...for helping preserve freedom...many years ago.",1227571200,7,254,4.478260869565218
8284193,5,B001BPD4T2,"I give this 5 stars for color and sound quality.  Other than that it was totally biased and one sided.  The DRV, NVA and VC were depicted as something they were not.  GI's were put down as baby killers and torturers, which they were not.  Don't waste your money on this one.",1495152000,,274,4.211538461538462

8284198,5,B001BPD4T2,"Unflinching, objective and brutally honest.  Easily still the best TV documentary on the war itself and the tumultuous era it helped define.  Originally broadcast when feelings were still fairly raw on the subject, this was the first expansive production of its kind in the U.S. that featured interviews from all sides: infantrymen under live fire, strategists and planners, the family back home, the deeply involved heads of state--on both sides--and more.  Fantastic job on the very long roots of the conflict before it became an American war: the French colonial period, Japanese occupation in WW2 and the birth of modern Vietnamese nationalism.  The turmoil and heroism of the battlefields is mirrored in the turmoil in the home front.  Supporters and detractors, draftees and draft dodgers, media and military, the powerful and the peasantry, all are heard.  Very well produced and often the jumping off point for people wanting to view (or read) more on Vietnam, and deservedly so.  On par with Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" and Thames Television's ""World at War,"" this is where you start.",1423958400,6,1088,5.1477272727272725

8284202,2,B001BPD4T2,"My father purchased this 9 part set for me and it was with high expectations that I loaded the discs and started watching them. Unfortunately this series was very poorly organized and therefore wasted a fair amount of its length repeating the same events, ostensibly from ""different perspectives"". A war this large, lengthy and complicated would have benefited a great deal more from a more narrative approach in my opinion.

I concur somewhat with the previous review that complained about amount of air time given to triumphalist North Vietnamese interviews and the rather immense volumes of coverage of those Americans who were against the war. These viewpoints are certainly valid, but the lack of balance was notable. Pro-war viewpoints seemed to be largely those of officials responsible for creating and carrying out the policies. As such they tended to be factual and narrative rather than polemic, and it would have been nice to see the anti-war polemics balanced with some more purely political viewpoints from the other side.

I don't agree that this production was simply an anti-war love in however. I think that the aim of the series was to present a balanced view of the war, however poorly this was done. Despite the efforts to present the war from a number of perspectives, I feel the producers failed in this. Every given perspective lacked focus and the overall effect I feel will leave most people with little narrative feel for the events depicted. Those who are seeing these events for the first time will most likely be left confused. Those of us who lived through these events will have little to show for the time spent watching them again other than perhaps some nauseating nostalgia as we see old news footage again. Save your time and money and watch something else.",1302825600,5,1794,4.917491749174918
