8548353,5,B00A8OFPAI,"If you have the CC Books the most valuable thing about the videos is seeing the exact form and the PACE the workouts are actually done in. Starting the pullups from the top with a pause is a whole new ballgame. There are lots of valuable things you gain from these if you are serious. Watching these guys is a inspiration of what it should look like. Nope there are no routines but those are in the books. These accomplish what the books leave out. Seeing tremendous athletes doing the program not the sloppy form and hurried pace of what some people do on youtube. I tell people about the program and the first thing I get when they look it over is- "" I figure about 4-maybe 5 weeks to get through a step "" Usually step 1 on push ups gives them a really quick dose of reality done with proper form and pace. Horizontal pull ups take most people 6 months for that phase. It's not about how fast you go through it - it's getting the very most out of each and every step before moving on to the next.",1380412800,2,998,4.149484536082475
8548354,3,B00A8OFPAI,"To start, I have tried pretty much all the workouts on the market (P90X, P90X 2, P90X Plus, Tapout, kettlebells...), so I really didn't expect too much being different in terms of workout material.  I was more or less looking for different routines.

The delivery was extremely fast, arriving in less than 5 days standard.  However, the actual material is just video of what is outlined in the Convict Condioning book.  It brings you through the 10 steps of pull-ups outlining the negative and positive etc.  There are no real ""workout"" routines in this video or any of the others.  So after buying all 5 of the DVDs in this series (Pull-ups, pushups, legs, bridges, leg raises) and spending over $300, you still need the book to actually find out a workout routine, unless of course you know how to design one yourself.  Since the book actually gives you routines and goes over everything that's in the videos, you can save a lot of money by just buying the book!  If you truly need a visual to know how to do a pull-up/push-up etc., then sure get the videos, but if you can simply read how to do them, then save the $$$!",1359590400,12,1122,4.4926108374384235
