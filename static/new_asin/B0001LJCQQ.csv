8014145,4,B0001LJCQQ,"All three films in this package are presented well but lack many extras. The 2 documentaries are very interesting portraits of people and touch on more than just their work--you get a feel for who they are as people. The feature,""The American Friend"" is an interesting,non-conventional story that resembles something that Keislowski might come up with:personal,lacking distracting cuts every few seconds,and full of atmospheric scenes that allow the actors to slowly form the story.",1244419200,6,482,5.527027027027027
8014146,5,B0001LJCQQ,"When Nicholas Ray ` s creative spark was vanishing and the winter dreams arrived at the end of the road, Wenders inquired him to make the last documental-interview around his thoughts, points of view and other subjects in NYC .

Ray was dying of cancer but far to behave himself as a Romantic figure, Ray makes what a man must do: accept the death `s call and not to give up.

I still remember a smart statement of Bette Davis : ""To get old is not for the weak people."" And the undeniable talent of this German filmmaker this bold and painful testimonial will endure the sudden reverses of the forgetfulness and the fragile collective memory.

""The glory is the sun of dead"" Balzac.",1139961600,9,682,4.483870967741935
