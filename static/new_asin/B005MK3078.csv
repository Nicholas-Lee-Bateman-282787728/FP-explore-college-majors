The show focuses on the Sea Shepherds, a radical environmental group with the goal of protecting whales from Japanese whalers in the Southern/Antarctic Ocean.  I don't know much about the International Whaling Laws, but the Japanese claim to be killing up to 1000 whales for research purposes and selling the leftover whale meat (which apparently is allowable under the laws) and the Sea Shepards maintain that the Japanese are killing the whales solely to sell the meat for profit.  After watching the show, I personally tend to believe that the Japanese are not killing for research . . . based upon how quickly and efficiently they slaughter the whales (what kind of research relies upon immediate slaughter?  Why would you need to kill 1000 whales in short order for research?  And why not study living whales?) and based upon how much money the Japanese make from the sale of the whale meat.

But, honestly, it doesn't really matter where you stand on the issue of whaling.  The fact is that this show is intriguing to watch.  The viewer is literally watching a battle between the wealthy Japanese whalers and the ragtag Sea Shepherds, who are often broken in money and equipment, but never in spirit.  Just the strategic interplay, risky techniques, and the extremes to which both sides are willign to go to pursue their goals is endlessly fascinating.  And the risks as helicopters and small inflatable boats are launched overboard an aging vessel with borderline equipment literally have me holding my breath.

The leader of the Sea Shepherds, Paul Watson, requires that his volunteers be willing to risk their own lives to save the lives of whales . . . and on this show, that literally happens nearly every episode.

While you might not agree with the Sea Shepherds' strategies, you can't deny their passion.  And that translates into one gripping show!",1341187200,,1978,4.921686746987952
