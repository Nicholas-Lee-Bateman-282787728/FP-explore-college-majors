4013836,5,B002YPX3IK,"the film lived up to the hype, just not in the way I expected. sorta like a Bunyip Dreaming or Green Iguana for a new generation. amazing cinemetography and the surfers speak for themselves, each with a really unique style and approach. nice selection of some more under-the-radar spots too.",1260576000,3,291,4.84
8384346,4,B002YPX3IK,Good surf video but a little too overproduced.  It sometimes takes 30 seconds inbetween songs to see surf footage and it is literally some guy staring off in the distance for 10 seconds while the song is building up.  The footage is incredible and there is plenty of variety that kept me interested but I'm not a huge fan of the editing.  3.5 stars.,1431734400,,349,4.421875

8384348,5,B002YPX3IK,Hands down one of the top surf movies to come about in a long time. Highly recommend this one. Seems like It's getting harder and harder to find copies of this one. Cheers,1396051200,,171,4.212121212121212
8384349,5,B002YPX3IK,"Insane. Gorgeous. A surfing masterpiece. Easily one of the top 10 surf films I own. The music is varied, the surfing is completely mind-blowing and the locations they visit are from all over the globe. Each section is unique to it's own but Neville's chapter transitions nicely links all of the film together into one cohesive and mind-blowing surf flick.",1392336000,,355,4.933333333333334
8384350,5,B002YPX3IK,Great surfing by great surfers - a must have for anyone interested in modern surfing. Certain to be a classic!,1380067200,,110,4.55
8384351,5,B002YPX3IK,"The overall surf is very sick. The locations are super awesome and very secluded, although I could figure out a few places on my own. This is the first video I've seen that has an M83 song in it. I watched that scene over and over again because of the M83 song alone. Best surf video I've seen in a long ass time. Artistic, epic, solid.",1353715200,,336,4.106060606060606
8384352,3,B002YPX3IK,"The surfing in this movie was legit.  Quality. Nice wives and plenty of big airs and that good stuff, well pleased.  Only complaint is all the other crap between surfing.  The intro is hella cheezy, literally a cheezy light pyramid and they're all gathering around it.  It sounds funny but its meant to be serious in the film.  This sort of cheezyness continues throughout surf segments.  Got to be bothersome.  The other thing i didn't like was that you maybe hear a total of 7 words from the actual surfers the whole time.  It's like 6 dudes (cant remember how many exactly) flying around the world to some sick, exotic looking locations, and not a peep. I could keep going but i don't want to get too subjective.  I would try n get this dvd cheap or just do the instant download for $8 or something.  Its definitely worth watching for the surf alone but the $20 plus i have seen for it, not so much.",1350950400,,902,4.379518072289157
8384353,5,B002YPX3IK,A little over the top in terms of trying to be artistic ... but an excellent surf video in general.,1348790400,,99,4.0

8384355,5,B002YPX3IK,Some of the most Intense surfing caught on film. You watch this film and you'll want to punt over some kooks faces and steal their girlfriends who were suntanning on the beach!,1345161600,,176,4.53125
