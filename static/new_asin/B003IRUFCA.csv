4128138,5,B003IRUFCA,"First let me say that I am a big fan of Larry Blamire.  I think that he is one on the greatest satirists to ever work in the film industry.  I say this because there are few satire films that can actually hold up as one of the films they are parodying, had they come out in the same time.

Larry somehow accomplishes this.  Time and time again.

Had the original Lost Skeleton of Cadavra come out in the 50's, it would have fit right in with Plan 9 From Outer Space and the like.  The difference of course is that unlike Plan 9, Skeleton is funny ON PURPOSE.  Blamire's prodigious wit is off the charts and he knows the material he is parodying better than most.  Nearly every single line is hilarious and quotable.  It's truly one of those movies that gives you something new every time you watch it.  To quote Beetlejuice ""it keeps gettin' funnier, EVERY SINGLE TIME I SEE IT!""

So here we have the much awaited sequel to ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" entitled ""The Lost Skeleton Returns Again"".  The insane dialog that sounds as if it was written 60 years ago, the purposeful ""bad acting"" and all the characters and actors from the original are back in force here.  But that's not to say that this movie is simply a retread of the original, far from it.  This sequel is less of a 50's Sci-Fi parody and more of a 50's Jungle Adventure parody, complete with an embittered, drunk of a hero, a quest for some fictional ore, and some really silly natives. Monsters, space aliens, good twins (not evil), cantaloupes, temples, idols, and a sarcastic jerk of a skull complete the recipe. By the end, you too will be singing the name of Fleming.

Granted, not every movie goer will ""get"" this film, it's definitely not for everyone. Larry unabashedly produces the films he wants to, for a very specific audience. If you liked the original or enjoy films of the 50's then you owe it to yourself to see this movie.  MST3K fans will also eat this stuff up.

I know that I personally will be buying anything that come from the twisted mind of Mr. Blamire.

Thanks for the laughs Larry, keep em coming!",1282521600,13,2093,4.420365535248042
4128139,4,B003IRUFCA,"Ok, Ok...I'll come clean.  Blamire had my entire family hooked on Skelly with his original movie ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"".  So in that sense...we are simply shilling for this very worthy and funny sequel.  I gave it four stars out of five only because, although it is hilarious and so ""Blamire-esque"", it can't have that ""new movie smell"" that the original had.  Still...this sequel is so satisfyingly funny that I must say two words...""Cantaloupe Dance"".  Don't know what that means??  Well...watch this film and I guarantee you won't ever forget them!

My family's thanks to Larry Blamire and his zany cast for a wonderfully funny (and fruity) film!!

P.S.  We demand a Skelly 3!!!",1282435200,,689,4.921739130434783
4128140,5,B003IRUFCA,"Like its repetition-peppered dialogue, The Lost Skeleton Returns Again is absurd, unnecessary, and entirely wonderful! I have been looking forward to seeing it for quite some time, with a tiny bit of anxiety. I was worried that the magic of The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra was something inextricably related to the sheer wackiness of its concept, and that trying to repeat the effect would merely shine a light on its comedic wants. However, while this majestic sequel never quite out does its predecessor, it certainly keeps pace and proves that Blamire and company are definitely not one-hit wonders. I urge anyone who might be the slightest bit curious to take the plunge! I FLY NOW!",1282348800,2,683,4.947826086956522
4128141,4,B003IRUFCA,"Larry obviously took a different tack with this picture, and he should have we don't need two exactly the same.  This one has way more people, better filming and budget and all that is good.  The only thing that I didn't like is that I think this film pushed too close to the limit of acceptable ridiculousness a couple of times.

The original was PERFECT, so there's my prejudice, as far as how one can go and not slip off the edge.

Now, having said that, I'll say this....

The Lost Skeleton Returns Again is awesome, funny, brilliant and I'll own it forever and watch it probably a dozen times.

Thank-you Larry and crew for all your hard work!  Keep it up!!!",1282348800,,663,4.385245901639344
4128142,5,B003IRUFCA,"My wife and I just finished watching the film, and I'm happy to say that we had skele-tons of fun. We laughed, we giggled, we chortled. I even shot milk out of my nose a few times, and I wasn't drinking milk at the time, so that's saying something.

I was blown away by the sheer comedic brilliance of Larry and the gang. They put the fun in funny and the funny in funnytastic.

The Lost Skeleton Returns Again is indeed one of the smartest stupidest movies of all time.

Larry's films are an important part of an unbalanced breakfast, so buy yourself a box of Skelet-O's and chow down.",1282003200,10,586,4.3090909090909095
4128143,4,B003IRUFCA,"Cower in fear, mortals! The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra may have been smashed to bits in the last movie, but now he returns! Again!

And this time instead of all-American B-movies, the spoofery is aimed at those jungle adventure/""lost world"" movies. ""The Lost Skeleton Returns Again"" brings back everyone (and I do mean everyone) from the previous movie, and while it's not as hilarious as the first movie, it's still a fun little parody with flying skulls, monsters and lots of science.

Military man Pappin (Frank Dietz) arrives at the house of Betty Armstrong (Fay Masterson), only to find out that her husband has been missing in the jungles of the Amazon for two years. So Betty (in full Crocker regalia) and Pappin head off to South America to find Paul (Larry Blamire) who is now an embittered drunk. But he agrees to help find Geranium 90, a vital... rock that can only be found deep in the jungle.

At the same time, Kro-Bar (Andrew Parks) and Lattis (Susan McConnell) have returned to Earth, since their danger detector alerted them to... Betty and Paul being in danger. So they pose as humans and join a crooked expedition that also wants Geranium 90. And Peter Fleming (Brian Howe) finds a mysterious skull amongst his late brother's belongings, and it compels him to go to South America so it can regain its body by using a magical idol.

As the two groups move through the jungle, towards the Valley of the Monsters (no, this doesn't really alarm them), they must fight their way through the deadly prehistoric flora and fauna. And finally they must encounter the Cantaloupe People, and the monster that hides their ancient idol... whose name escapes me.

""The Lost Skeleton Returns Again"" isn't QUITE as funny as the movie that precedes it, mainly because you know what to expect -- B-movie monster suits, stilted dialogue, ""jungles"" that look suspiciously like California, inserted animal footage, characters who talk vaguely about ""science,"" and strange little dances.

So of course, there's lot of spoofy material (a rubber snake that leaps and wrestles with Jungle Brad!) and silly dialogue (""The jungle gets into your blood and builds tiny little houses of pain, and you better not be there when the rent's due!""). And while the titular skeleton is a slightly less imposing figure than before (""I have no HANDS!"") he still rules every scene he's in, especially when he goes randomly zooming around the jungle.

And pretty much all of the actors return, although some play the twins of the first movie's characters. Masterson is almost scary as the 50s housewife who smilingly trots through the jungle with a picnic basket,  while Blamire gets to channel a truckload of hilariously over-the-top wangst (and constantly reminding people that he's bitter!). McConnell and Parks are particularly funny when they pretend to be human, and Alison Martin is fun as the queen of the Cantaloupe people, who is confronted with the magic of double negatives!

""The Lost Skeleton Returns Again"" is a solid sequel to... well, the movie that the Lost Skeleton is returning from. It's full of science... and military men... and rocks.",1281657600,2,3134,4.920454545454546
4128144,4,B003IRUFCA,"Having been raised on the monster movies of the 50's, I have a deep appreciation for their cornball appeal.  At night in our bunk beds, my brother and I would take turns quizzing one another about how various monsters (e.g. Invaders from Mars, The Thing, The Mole People, Attack of the Crab Monsters, This Island Earth, Tarantula, The Amazing Colossal Man, The Monolith Monsters, The Giant Claw, etc.) were finally vanquished by the earthlings under attack.

The Lost Skeleton Returns Again takes such conventions as 1) show a part of the monster - a claw, a shadow, a left-over body part -  early in the film, but 2) don't reveal the entire monster until near the end for the final battle.  Add a surfeit of 3) cheesy dialogue, blandly nuanced performances, scenes which tell but don't show, plus lots of filler to stretch it out to feature length...voila... you've got a perfect Saturday matinee monster movie.

Sure, there were classics like The Incredible Shrinking Man, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and the Hammer Films, but we still loved those B & W sci-fi, nuclear radiation, giant monster movies.  For 25 cents my parents had the greatest weekend babysitter of all time - the Saturday matinee.  My brother and I could sit through a double feature  twice, especially if Harryhausen's The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad was playing.

Once, I had to take him out in the lobby when he got scared during Killers from Space - remember the aliens with the black dots painted on ping pong ball eyes?.  We screamed ""MUSH!"" if Robin Hood kissed Maid Marion, or laughed at Danny Kaye in The Court Jester, or watched a baby colt being born in Gallant Bess.  But, most of all, we loved monster movies.

Thanks to the inspired writer, cast and crew of The Lost Skeleton Returns AGAIN.  I laughed aloud and was transported back to those joyous days of my childhood. Kudos for an affectionate knowing spoof of the genre. I'm not going to provide any SPOILERS since we've all seen this movie a thousand times already. Lost Skeleton gets its homage to matinees right; it is really twisted in a fun way.  Many returns.",1281398400,19,2105,4.715846994535519
4128145,5,B003IRUFCA,"Lost Skeleton returns is a great movie.  Its a silly send up of the Jungle action movies of the '50s and its a great send up too.  Most of you favorite characters are back from the first movie and a few new ones show up for even more crazyness.

Jennifer Blaire shows up again as Animala, the sexy animial hybrid.  Ms Blaire is a hoot as the sexy alien.

Of course, the movie would not be complete with out the Skeleton.  He is pretty much only a skull in this movie, but his lines are perfect.

Not every one is going to get some of the sly humor in this movie.  Some of the gags only fans of 50 sci fi movies are going to get.  But everyone will enjoy the antics of the cast.  The Queen of the Cantaloupe People's Dance is worth the price of the DVD.

Larry Blamire's direction and writing are spot on.  The Black and White look of the film is perfect for this kind of send up and Blamire uses it perfectly.

For a pre order the cost of a lunch buffet at a Chinese buffet, Return of the Lost Skeleton is a good deal.  I have sure already ordered mine.",1272240000,37,1053,4.024154589371981

4128163,5,B003IRUFCA,"This is what my husband said as the final credits rolled. This sequel to the  original spoof of 50's B sci-fi has most of what the first part did : silly dialogue, feeble special effects and a hard to define sweetness. Some of the dialogue in the first scene between two military big wigs is so funny I wish they would make another film to parody the self serious ""procedural"" sci fi's. The bulk of the film is more of a characature study, as the protagonists wander through the jungle, an obvious arboretum . Like the last film, there are only a few basic jokes but they are good jokes and as they come around every few seconds in their different forms it creates a cumulative effect that is very pleasant. I look forward to any Blamire film I can get my hands on.",1447286400,,765,4.3125

4128219,5,B003IRUFCA,"Like its predecessor, The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, ""Returns Again"" is both a salute to goofy movies of the past and a fresh comedy in its own right. While the original Lost Skeleton paid homage to the cheapo 50s scifi movies that MST3K roasted so well and so often, ""Returns Again"" mish-mashes that genre with the jungle adventure films that might have starred Stewart Granger or Cornell Wilde, if only they'd had the budget for real stars, a real director, and talented writers. Six characters reappear from the original, rock science guy Dr. Paul Armstrong, his cluelessly happy 50s housewife Betty, the aliens Krobar and Lattis, one step ahead and two beats behind their earthling companions, Animala, and the Skeleton himself. All are essentially the same, but seem to be going through phases (e.g., the aliens have become battling Bickersons), none more so than the villain and our hero. The mind-controlling Skeleton's path to World Domination is frustratingly limited by his lack of appendages. When first introduced, Larry Blamire's Paul Armstrong, possibly the most devoted scientist of his or any time, has lost himself in a fifth of jungle bitterness. (""The jungle is every place for bitterness. It sows and reaps it like so much cane sugar. The jungle gets into your blood and builds tiny little houses of pain and you don't wanna be there when the rent's due because the anaconda, funny thing, they don't know how to read a lease."") Fortunately, Fay Masterson's Betty always knows when to say the right thing, bringing Paul back from the brink. If anyone can be said to have experienced growth, it's Jennifer Blaire's Animala (aka Pammy), but maybe that's just evolution. In the first film, she was more canine-like (""always agree""), but in ""Returns Again"" she has picked up a cat's pleasure in toying with its ""master"" (if not ignoring him/her outright) to go with her sensual panther moves. Two members of writer/director/Dr. Armstrong's house players, Dan Conroy and Brian Howe, play twins of characters killed in the first film.  Howe and the Skeleton team up again as the annoying master and put-upon controllee in one of the best scifi comedy teams ever. The new characters are types we've all seen, from Dan Roebuck's take on Sydney Greenstreet's Gutman to HM Wynant's version of a thousand Z-grade movie military men. Alison Martin plays her role of Queen of the Cantaloupes as pure comedy.  A niche comedy, perhaps, but I love it.",1365811200,,2453,4.965936739659368
4128220,4,B003IRUFCA,"Mind-numbingly silly language, campy acting, truly naff FX, and many reprises of earlier roles.
We thoroughly enjoyed the first ""Lost Skeleton"" movie, with some genuinely hilarious scenes and lots of wonderfully awful acting. A minor masterpiece.
The sequal is about equally worthwhile, with the option of viewing in color or b&w. The color is quite poor, and it really is better seen in b&w.

Blamire and Masterson return in their original roles. Masterson mincing about like a small child creeping about a forbidden garden is a revelation. The skeleton returns as merely the skull, with supernatural powers. The use of a rather arrogant voice over, and a fixed skull, to create such villainy is quite clever. An embittered Blamire adds a faux gravitas of sorts. One expects him to be tasted at some time, to see just how bitter he really is.

The alien couple are even more silly, and the other support actors ham it up well.
The crappy monsters are silly beyond belief, but not as bad as a gorilla with a fish bowl over its head, tending a bubble machine.

I found Shinfa, the canteloupe woman, very uncomfortable to watch, quite ugly in fact,(maybe intended) and Animala rather less appealing the second time round. Whereas most of the acting, dialog and movement was entertainingly silly-bad, I found these two quite weak, and just bad, not adding to the entertainment. In my view,they had too much screen-time, but fortunately, the rest more than made up for these two.
Our teen children giggled and smirked a lot. Visually, not unlike Python. Bizarre dialog is the go, but very different from the way that Poms use dialog in comedy.

4128228,3,B003IRUFCA,"Most bad movies are simply bad--but now and then you come across one that is actually bad in an entertaining sort of way, with the films of Ed Wood perhaps the most famous. Released in 2001, THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA was an homage to such films with a parody of the style.  In 2009 the film's creators revisited the subject with THE LOST SKELETON RETURNS AGAIN, another bit of nonsense that reunites director-writer-actor Larry Blamire with the original cast.

The plot is suspiciously similar.  Various people with various motives are after a newly discovered mineral named Jerranium 90.  These include Dr. Paul Armstrong (Blamire), who has been in the Amazon jungle on a two year drunk, and the skull of the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, which has to mentally overpower various people in an effort to find the rock and restore himself to full form.  They are helped and hindered by Armstrong's wife Betty (Fay Masterson), aliens Kro-Bar and Lattis (Andrew Park and Susan McConnell), and Animalia (Jennifer Blaire), who is created by an alien ray gun from several jungle animals.  Ultimately, everyone enters the Valley of Monsters, where they encounter a series of grade-C monsters and the Chinfa, Queen of the Cantaloupe People (Alison Martin.)

It helps if you've seen THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA, for much of the joke is in the reunion of the cast.  Characters who died in the earlier film return as identical twins in THE LOST SKELETON RETURNS AGAIN; everyone wears the same costumes; and so on.  It also helps if you've seen the B movies the film parodies.  If not, you'll be staring slack-jawed at the screen wondering why this movie is supposed to be entertaining.  Even if you have seen the original and are a fan of the genre, you'll probably find that THE LOST SKELETON RETURNS AGAIN is about fifteen minutes too long; like Blamire's other films, the joke runs dry before the film ends, and a little judicious editing would not be amiss.  The DVD comes with a ""making of"" doc, gag reel, and an audio commentary in which the commentators are having more fun than the movie is actually worth.  Still, recommended if you're a fan of this sort of thing.

As you know, sequels are rarely as good as their originals, but this one is an exception.  As you may have already guessed, all the dead characters come back as their better half twins in the film.
  As usual, more monsters and aliens and a few new characters along with many of the old characters from the original film.  It was like homecoming week for me.  I was so happy to see the original characters looking very recognizable, (this always fascinates me because I know I don't look anything like I did 8 years earlier).

4128232,5,B003IRUFCA,"After the cult hit ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavera"", director Larry Blamire brings back most of the cast from that film for this sequel where the setting is the Amazon, Blamire plays Dr. Paul Armstrong who has been there for 2 years and is now an alcoholic having given up on science. However once a government official Reet Pappin (Frank Dietz) is dispatched to the Amazon to find the doctor, Paul's wife Betty (Fay Masterson) comes along and they all go into the jungle to find the next rarest of all minerals Jerranium 90.

Oh and the twin brother of the evil doctor from the first movie comes along with the skull of the Lost Skeleton, who has him under his control. The alien couple Kro-Bar and Lattis also make an appearance, trying to help Paul and Betty on their quest. This is just as funny as the first movie, has a whole new slew of movie cliches to parody, mainly all the old cheesy sci-fi flicks that used countless hours of stock footage and cheesy effects to make voyages into the jungle seem interesting.

Larry Blamire certainly has a great sense of comedy when it comes to this and the first movie, he definitely nails the mark with this one. Loved all the cliched and deadpan but hilarious lines written by Blamire who is so smart and has such a vast movie knowledge that it makes for better comedy. He appreciates these films he mocks, which really lends some punch to the movie itself.

  What I got was a very well done spoof of 1950's sci-fi cheesefest. The humor was subtle and matched the 1950's style of dialog and ""action"" (there really wasn't any)The humor is sprinkled throughout the film. In fact there was rarely a moment when I was wasn't laughing or at the very least amused.
  There were quite a few laugh out loud moments (""Slowly!"") and some great DUH! moments. The ""plot"" made about as much sense as the movies they were mocking which is part of the movie's charm. They even used some of the same film techniques used by the B-movie makers, (repeatedly used scenery, mismatched quotes and out of place laughter).
  If you are like me and love old, cheeseie sci-fi, you will enjoy this  solid comedy. As an added bonus, you can watch it with the kids as there is  nothing inappropriate, no swears, nudity or even sexual references.  Yes, it is possible to be funny without being vulgar. Amazing!

I found the oversaturated color to be distracting.  Falling back on so much doubletalk instead of letting the zany material work for itself was also a huge mistake.  Just throwing out weird sentences isn't funny, it's desperate.  The attention to detail also wasn't as apparent in this sequel.

The only way to avoid this terror is not to watch (which may actually be the best option).  But chances are, you won't be able to look away.  This film is like a bad car or train wreck...no matter how much you want to look away, you just can't do it!

Survivors of the LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA will see lots of familiar faces...Scientific Dr. Paul Armstrong and his perky wife Betty, ""Ranger"" Brad's twin brother ""Jungle"" Brad, evil Dr. Flemming's twin brother, the TV repairman Peter Flemming, Lattis and Kro-Bar, and of course, Animala!  And there is also a host, OK, half of a host of new characters including the Cantaloupians, and, terror of terrors, MAGRACLOP that lives in the ""Valley of Monsters"" in the Amazon, which also happens to be the only place on the planet where you can find the incredibly rare and incredibly valuable new rock ""Germainium-90.""  (You had to know that a rock would be in the mix.)

In case you haven't seen either of these films, they are filmed (mostly) in black and white and spoof 1950s sci-fi B-Grade horror movies.  The effects are terrible, the dialog is corny at best, and the actors play it straight, which makes it incredibly funny.

It's one of those movies that is so bad, it's good, but I still can't bring myself to award it 5 stars.  4 stars is all I can manage.

WARNING: Be sure to watch ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadvra"" before watching this film.  Your life just might depend on it!  All right, not, but if you don't this film won't be nearly as funny.

4 stars!  Thanks for the laughs!",1310774400,,2082,4.988405797101449
4128243,3,B003IRUFCA,"Playing ridiculous comedy with a straight face is an amazingly difficult thing to pull off - which is what made THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA so remarkable in the first place. Unfortunately, it's also why THE LOST SKELETON RETURNS AGAIN doesn't quite hit the same consistently hilarious marks. Larry Blamire and company set themselves a high bar with LOST SKELETON, successfully playing on the deadpan sincerity of actors who don't know they're in a terrible movie, and never, ever winking at the camera. That loopy earnestness is mostly missing from LOST SKELETON RETURNS, and the movie is poorer for it.

It's hard to tell precisely where this sequel goes astray. Maybe it's the new cast members, who mostly don't fit with the style of the original ensemble. For example, Alison Martin (""Queen Chinfa"") seems to have dropped in from a Mel Brooks movie without knowing it. A few of the returning actors do continue to nail the straight-ahead tone: Dan Conroy expertly underplays the square-jawed hero ""Jungle Brad,"" and Andrew Parks and Susan McConnell are back on their game as the naive aliens Lattis and Kro-Bar. But even the veterans are trying a little too hard much of the time.

Maybe it's the writing and direction, which isn't as sharply focused this time around. Larry Blamire's script sets everything up just right to send up the cliches of movie sequels: the improbable return of major characters, evil twins, hackneyed character development, and so forth. But he himself falls into the sequel trap of trying to do more of everything. The number of characters is nearly doubled, leaving some with very little to do, or just one note to play. The plot meanders in several directions, which causes the third act to drag to an abrupt resolution. Then there's the recurring problem of tone: The acting and writing emphasizes to the audience that everyone's in on the joke, when what was truly funny about the first LOST SKELETON was that they weren't.

Maybe it's the design: The original LOST SKELETON could almost have been mistaken for the long-lost second half of some double feature found in the ruins of an old drive-in, but this sequel doesn't take as much care to match an antique, 1950s visual style. (When I saw the name of the Chiodo bros. in the opening credits, I got my hopes up that maybe we'd see some Ray Harryhausen-style stop motion monsters, and indeed, the movie seems to head in that direction for a moment -- but alas, no.)

Still, there's much to like here: there are still plenty of laughs, even if they hit less frequently, and some wonderful design touches and little details. The biggest highlight is a terrific original orchestral score by John Morgan and William Stromberg -- it sounds very much like a classic '50s/'60s Bernard Herrmann adventure score, in fact, which is a perfect fit. Bottom line: while we bought this because we love the original LOST SKELETON so much, and will keep it, we'll probably be re-watching the first movie a lot more.",1307232000,4,2987,4.839530332681018

4128254,5,B003IRUFCA,"This movie is the second truest movie ever made, the first truest movie ever made being of course The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.

Filmed in Super Skeletorama, The Lost Skeleton Returns Again is quite simply a special effects tour-de-force. Using the very latest latex-over-foam-rubber and monofilament wire marionette techniques the director plunges one into a mad world in which one feels as though the demented eponymous monster might at any moment burst from the screen and bonk one's head until one collapsed from not being able to take any more, to expire shortly afterwards on the carpet.

But horror is not the only emotion coaxed from the reluctant viewer by this masterpiece. Who could not ache in sympathy while watching the ultimately fruitless Cantaloupe Dance, or sit silent while Cro-bar and Lattice sing the name of Flemming with pride as his now-lifeless body cools? Who could not feel themselves moved to tears at the seemingly relentless bitterness of Paul Armstrong, a bitter, disillusioned and bitter alcoholic after science so badly let him down?

Powerful stuff.

Okay, lets get sensible for a bit.

If you don't like terrible science fiction ""B"" movies, the kind that kept drive-in theaters in business during the 60s and early 70s, don't bother.

If you saw The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and hated it, don't bother.

The dialogue in this sequel doesn't have the same wide-eyed feel, slipping sometimes into ""Police Squad"" territory (the difference being that the former doesn't openly acknowledge the gag and the latter does). This detracts from the experience in my opinion.

The special effects have been improved over those used in Lost Skeleton (yes, I know, I know, you find this hard to believe) with a flying saucer now conveying Lattice and Cro-bar into the action, *two* monsters wading about the place dealing death and mayhem, the Skeleton (now a shadow of its former self but still bossing people around) and something else I won't spoil.

One area in which the film has truly outdone itself is that of the use of foreground models to re-carve scenic features without recourse to tectonic orogeny or trips to New Zealand. The pyramid of the Cantaloupe People is one of the best examples of the technique I've seen personally.

The cast is pretty much the gang from Lost Skeleton, back for a second helping. ""But how can this be"" I hear you say. ""Several of the Lost Skeleton cast were dead at the end of that movie"". Well, Mr/Mrs/Ms (delete as appropriate) Smartypants, the scriptwriter has hit upon the idea - unique in my experience - of bringing back those actors *as the identical twin of their dead relative*! Now *that's* creativity at work!

And what a cast! The actors chew the scenery every chance they get, as actors will when properly moved by the material. This is a good thing. Animala is back too, after one of the cast meddles with the transmogritator, and may I say ""Rowr!"" in approval of her new Jungle animal constitution.

And the plot? Read the product blurb for that.

4128255,4,B003IRUFCA,"I really enjoyed ""Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" when it made its debut several years ago, so I was pretty interested in seeing the sequel.  It does not disappoint.  Same bizarre and corny humor, handled well by the cast, who seem to take it all in stride.  This time we head to the Amazon in search of ""Jerranium 90"".  And, if someone expired in the first film, well, gosh, they seem to have had an identical twin that shows up in THIS one.

It's the good guys vs. the bad guys, and they're all up against the (ahem) fearsome creatures in the Valley Of The Monsters.  And what fearsomely cheesy monsters they are too.  And Jungle Brad (identical twin to the deceased Ranger Brad) seems to know all their names by heart.  Both good guys and bad guys also hook up with the bizarre Chinfa, Queen Of The Canteloupe People, who performs ""The Canteloupe Dance"", which has got to be the most exotic...uh,no..sensuous?  No, no, uh, incredible?...well, incredibly ridiculous and hilarious, parts of the movie.  And our film would not be at all complete without the return of Animala, truly one of my favorite characters from the first film (mrowr) and the bizarre alien couple trying to pass as human.

A TV screen that once only showed me little moving pictures, comedies or romances or even animal shows, now it controls what I do, and it controls me in ways I hadn't been controlled before, like forcing me to watch this movie as if I were hypnotized, again and again.

I like laughing, but this is a serious review. A very well made sequel to the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, tighter acting, directing and even  special effects propel this forward at a fun pace. The writing is witty and perfectly distilled to make every cliched scene from every ""B"" movie  from the past ring with humor, truth and affection. A staple of nearly every movie that has a gun in the plot, the ""Turn around...slowly"" scene has been particularly well parodied to the point that after you stop hyperventilating from laughter, you feel slightly foolish for realizing you previously watched hundreds of movies with a ""Turn around...slowly"" scene without ever noticing how ubiquitous it was.

Certainly worth owning this one if you have any interest in humor, genre films of the 40's & 50's or science. Or charismatic egomaniacal skulls. Or H.M.

The sequel does not disappoint in this regard at all.  It is a much different movie than the original (more different than I probably expected), with a somewhat different feel to it, but the dialogue was, once again, hilarious.  I think those people who have seen the movie will agree that, after seeing the movie, the movie has shown itself to be very funny, causing laughter in the hearts and minds of those who have seen this, that is, the movie.

4128267,5,B003IRUFCA,"I first saw writer/director/actor/producer Larry Blamire's debut feature film ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" back around 2004, it quickly became one of my favorite films that I had seen in quite some time. A spoof the old Z-grade sci-fi/monster type movies from the 50's like Robot Monster, Attack of the Crab Monsters & Plan 9 from Outer Space, Larry Blamire and his wonderful cast quickly churned out one of the most entertaining (and quotable) movies that I had seen in years. Finally on DVD, the sequel titled appropriately ""The Lost Skeleton Returns Again"" arrived on DVD 8/17/10 courtesy of Shout! Factory after a very limited theatrical run. I can safely say that if you loved the 1st film, that you're going to equally like the sequel. In fact, I feel that I enjoyed the sequel even more.

The sequel is more of a spoof of those 50's/60's movies like The Lost World in which some intrepid group of people travel through a jungle of some sort (in this case the Amazon) and encounter odd monsters & inhabitants at every turn. The entire cast from the original film returns with some playing identical twins to characters that were killed off in the 1st film. The titular skeleton returns as well but is not quite all of the skeleton that he used to be. ;) The movie is in black/white as well but color is introduced in the film at a critical point which adds more to the proceedings. I loved the fact that instead of just repeating the 1st film that they took the sequel in a different direction which helps it complement the 1st film in most excellent fashion.

Basically, the sequel gives you even more of what people loved from the 1st film and manages to build on that. Goofy, hilarious, appropriately cheesy and infectiously acted, The Lost Skeleton Returns comes highly recommended for lovers of old Z-grade films of the same ilk. And like the 1st Lost Skeleton film, you'll find yourself quoting this film all the time after seeing it!",1283126400,3,1948,4.6763848396501455
4128268,5,B003IRUFCA,"As an avid Mystery Science Theater fan I very much enjoyed The Lost Skeleton Returns Again. If you've seen The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, the first movie in the series, the style seems kind of different. The humor in Returns Again is a bit dry, more so than the original, and Returns Again seemed over done and I was a little disappointed for about 10 minutes. However, after I realized what they were trying to do with this movie, I started laughing hysterically and have enjoyed watching the whole thing again and again.

Cadavra was great because it was a spoof of old 1950s movies, and was made with a seemingly very limited budget. All the special effects and props reflected that as everything looked improvised, like a spaceship made from a toilet paper tube. Without giving too much away, Returns Again is also a spoof of 1950s movies, but this time it's a spoof of sequels to bad movies. For instance they intentionally made it look like the movie was made with a higher budget, which it probably was. There are better special effects of course. And, there are even more cheesy stereotyped characters, which is totally awesome. Plus, all the characters from Cadavra, including those that were killed off, made their way back in Returns Again one way or another--often with excuses for why they have returned again. With more characters there is more exciting craziness going on. Yes, there are more monsters, including trilobites--pulled across the ground. The locations, scenery and stock footage are awesome too, (supposed to be a jungle) and lots of it was actually filmed at an arboretum, and there is even a plant monster that looks like something from that old lost in space television show.

I usually don't watch DVD commentary but I made an exception in this case. Smart move because it just made me enjoy the movie even more. The only thing I can complain about is the absence of a trailer. There is a nice 11 minute behind the scenes/making of bonus though.",1283126400,,1976,4.741279069767442

It has the same tone, the same send-up of the genre it both adores and pokes fun at, and the same hilarious dialogue.  Seriously, if you don't find these lines absolutely side-splitting, then I am going to have to accuse you of not knowing and/or understanding the films that are being appreciated and parodied by this wonderful work.  The lines and the way they are delivered - that's the true gold of this film.

Look, personally, I'm not a fan of Hollywood funny.  Mostly because it's funny once (if that) and then simply disposable.  Blamire's films are absolutely quotable and hilarious every single time you watch them.  They are the inside joke with your friends.  They are the movies that you'll want to get a group of disparate acquaintances together to watch so that they can all have that one touchstone to refer to.  They are fantastic.  (And they are clean enough to watch with children which is amazing in its own right!!!  btw- I don't have kids, so it wouldn't make much difference to me either way)

Seriously, after being turned on to the original, I couldn't be happier.  Blamire & company give me hope that there are people out there who understand what it is to make a hilarious movie THAT I WANT TO OWN AND WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

Lost Skeleton Returns Again matches the same level of deadpan humor and creative caliber of hilarity.  Dr. Paul Armstrong is stricken with bitterness towards his love of science.  Animalia returns thanks to the transforming ray of the lovely aliens, Kro-Bar and Lattis.  Dan Roebuck (LOST), Trish Geiger, Alison Martin, and the others are great additions to the established cast.

As far as sequels goes, it doesn't get must better than Returns Again.  Blamire skillfully reintroduces the old characters with amusing twists while keeping true to their lovable personalities.  The new characters are a great asset to the film as well.  The storyline is cleverly crafted all the way to the end.
What about the new monsters?  They are simply amazing.  The costumes are exactly what you would expect after watching The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra with some improvements.

The Special effects got a facelift in the sequel.  After watching the special features, I found out the special effects were also homemade!  Quite impressive!

That said, it's not as funny as its illustrious predecessor (few sequels are as good as the originals) but there are more than enough laughs to make this a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  Some of my favorite moments (I'll try not to give away too much) included a long, bitter speech that Science Doctor Paul Armstrong gives before heading into the jungle, the occasional cutaways to obvious stock footage, the new monsters (all of which are _awesome_, my compliments to the creators), the way people in the first movie who died are miraculously brought back, and the existential whining of the skeleton himself (his personality has been developed considerably, though he's just as annoying as ever).  Also, the final (?) fate of the skeleton is classic, and all the acting is spot-on as usual.  And the lovely Animala/Pammy returns to do what only she can do best.  And Lattis and Kro-Bar are their usual clueless selves.  And the Fleming song is priceless.  And so on.

What I found frustrating about this film is that there were too many points where it felt like the movie was trying too hard to be funny.  Films like this walk a fine line; if it's too similar to what it's parodying it isn't funny, but if the jokes are too obvious it takes you out of the I-can-almost-believe-this-is-a-50s-monster-movie mindset you need to make it work.  The original Lost Skeleton movie did this brilliantly, probably better than it had ever been done before.  This movie also has lots of great examples of this, but there are also a lot of too-obvious jokes.  You need to be about 10% sillier than the original for the formula to work, and sometimes TLSRA went considerably beyond this (for instance, the ""double negative"" bit went on too long for me, or should I say didn't not go on too long).  Also, I wasn't fond of the character of the Queen of the Jungle (I won't give her full name for fear of divulging too much), though she was played with perfect gleeful overacting abandon by Alison Martin.  I _loved_ the character of Gondreau Sykes (what an accent!), but felt that he didn't have enough to do.  I felt the the same way about Trish Geiger's character: great potential, but not enough was done with it.

So: this movie has its share of rough edges, it's not a masterpiece of the order of LSOC, but it's still a very enjoyable ride.  I warmly recommend this to all fans of Science, and to all Science fans, and also to fans of a Scientific bent.  And also in addition to those who love Science, and/or additionally or alternatively to those who love those who love Science.  I think that covers it all.",1282867200,,2711,4.633891213389122

It tries too hard to put too many ""funny"" things in 90 minutes.  Not at all on the same level with ""The Lost Skeleton Cadavra.""",1282694400,2,260,3.9615384615384617
4128275,2,B003IRUFCA,"My husband and I eagerly anticipated getting our copy of The Lost Skeleton Returns Again.  The first one is our favorite movie of all time!  The first half of the sequel was great!  We loved the characters and humor.  However--after it went to ""techni-color"" (about half way through) we were greatly disappointed. :(  The Cantaloupe Queen and people made no sense and her attire was offensive.  Pammy's dancing this time was a much too seductive.  I would feel uncomfortable watching this with little kids (or my parents).  We are pretty conservative though in our movie standards and this just didn't live up.

PS--We did love Dark and Stormy Night though!",1282694400,,657,4.9
4128276,5,B003IRUFCA,"This sequel raises the bar for sequels. Some sequels can't even reach their drinks on the bar now. The return of the Lost Skeleton is full of fright, fun, family-friendliness, and, of course, monsters and the lost skeleton.  This is a throwback to the first hokey horror movies my mother nostalgia'd about.  This time the Skeleton and the gang head to the Amazon in search of another rarest-of-materials, Jerranium 90.  They meet up with all kinds of familiar faces and familiar faces' twins.

The intentional bad-acting didn't seem as bad this time but I was never disappointed.  The plot didn't seem to have as many intentional plot holes as LSOC; actually, the twists, as one might call 'em, were adequately twisty.  The intentional cheap-looking effects were top-drawer, actually not as cheap-looking this time, and the intentionally ridiculous (genius) dialogue had my fiance and me laughing out loud, rolling on the floor, laughing our bums off...

Do not act too 'slowly' to get this DVD because it is worth it.  This is perfect for a silly movie night.  Hmm, I wrote intentional a lot.  I guess this is an intentionally awesome movie from the creative mind of Larry Blamire.",1282608000,4,1182,4.924242424242424

The Cantaloupe Dance sequence provoked guffaws of delight from my buddies, as did the climactic showdown between the Lost Skeleton and the Magraclop.",1523404800,,351,5.363636363636363
