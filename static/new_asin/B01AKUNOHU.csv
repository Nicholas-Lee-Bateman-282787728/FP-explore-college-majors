7606915,1,B01AKUNOHU,Bad movie. It is a sequel yet the sheep from the first movie Blackie is gone replaced by another sheep with the same name that is delivered by a truck. There is no mention of the original Blackie. Again the dog is in love with a sheep. It is more of a rewrite then a sequel. I don't recommend this to anyone. I would rather give it zero stars.,1475280000,,343,3.9855072463768115
