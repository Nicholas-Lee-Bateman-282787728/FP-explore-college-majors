3869627,4,B0027W6HJ2,"The price for the 3 DVD's were great. But when you see lunchbox, you think a regular sized lunchbox. Not the case it is small. More for a small toddler's lunchbox. Great price and items just a lot smaller than expected.",1268092800,5,219,4.365853658536586
3869628,4,B0027W6HJ2,"My son is a huge Thomas fan & loves this lunch box.  He carries his trains around in it when it's not being used as a lunchbox.  I agree that it is somewhat small, but it's plenty big enough to pack a lunch and small snack for my 19 month old on days he goes to the sitter.  It's just big enough to hold the 3 DVDs it comes with.  My son also loves to watch the Thomas DVDs.  I think what you get is great for the price.",1261440000,,420,3.6741573033707864
3869629,3,B0027W6HJ2,"My nephew adores the videos, but that is not saying much.  He loses it over anything Thomas related.  The bag is too small and barely does the trick.  When he grows out of it for use as a lunch bag, my sis will use it to hold his dvds in the car...",1260835200,,248,3.730769230769231
3869630,2,B0027W6HJ2,Too small! Smaller than a regular lunch box. I could not fit a sippy cup in there.,1256688000,3,82,3.8823529411764706
3869631,1,B0027W6HJ2,"I was planning to use the Thomas lunchbox for my 3-yr-old who goes to preschool. This is too small to be a lunchbox, even for a preschooler. It would fit a snack & a juice box, that's about it. The DVD's are fine, but if you're looking for a Thomas lunchbox, do not purchase this set. If you want 3 Thomas DVD's, then you'll be okay with this choice.",1253750400,2,350,4.086956521739131
3869652,5,B0027W6HJ2,"My son adores Bob and loved getting this for his birthday.  He packs the plush lunch box around everywhere.  The DVDs are good, too, but the lunch box seems to be the part he loves most.",1383004800,,186,4.138888888888889

I recommend this gift set.",1364256000,,121,4.545454545454546

3869660,5,B0027W6HJ2,Not only is this neatly packaged but how many gifts are out there that not only is the box a lunch box but contains 2 fabulous DVD's. Hours of fun and entertainment.,1357430400,,165,4.1875
3869661,5,B0027W6HJ2,"My 2.5 year old son is a Bob the Builder fanatic, but there is not a lot of merchandise to be had on this side of the ""pond""! When I saw this lunch box set, I had to get it. It is very cute. I agree that the lunch box is small, it is not a normal sized lunch box - the three DVD's are jammed inside and barely fit. But when he starts preschool, he will only need a few snacks, so I think the size is perfect for him. Each DVD is 45 minutes, so you get quite a bang for the buck in this set. Christmas can't come soon enough this year; I want him to open this gift now!",1355011200,,568,3.6260162601626016

3869685,5,B0027W6HJ2,"I bought this lunchbox for my son when he started preschool since he loves Bob the Builder, and he loves it.  It's the right size for a preschooler, holds everything he needs, is easy to open and close, and has held up well through all of his abuse.  He enjoys the DVDs as well.",1316736000,6,278,4.12962962962963
3869686,3,B0027W6HJ2,"I read the reviews on this bag before I purchased it, but I didnot beleive it. I purchased the bag because one of the reviews stated that the bag can hold a sandwich box, juice, and snacks. Apart from that because my son is an advid Thomas fan he is enjoying the bag............",1308096000,,278,4.264150943396227

3869688,5,B0027W6HJ2,"This Barney lunchbox is so cool. It has 3 Barney DVDs such as Barney's Imagination Island (2004 DVD release), Barney's Adventure Bus (2004 DVD release), & Barney Everyone Is Special (2010 DVD release). I can use this Barney lunchbox as a keepsake box, a DVD suitcase, & other things that I can use. But I'm not taking THAT to school though.",1296864000,,340,4.590163934426229

3869690,4,B0027W6HJ2,"I've read some of the other reviews stating that this lunch box is small. I purchased this for my son who started pre-school and it works great for what we need. It holds his sandwich container and juice box and whatever else I include; apple sauce, fruit snacks, etc. It isn't the size of an adult lunch box, but do you really need something large for a pre-schooler?",1288915200,2,368,4.426470588235294
3869691,4,B0027W6HJ2,"Hi fellow reviewers,

I was hoping to contact the seller to request the measurements of the lunchbox since everyone said it was kind of small. Can anyone tell me how to contact one of the sellers? I don't see that option anywhere. I really want to get this for my son, but if the box won't work for us, I'll have to go through the pain in the neck return process.",1268697600,,363,4.112676056338028

8355187,4,B0027W6HJ2,"This little lunch box is adorable but it is very small.  I don't think my toddler's lunch will fit in it with an ice pack, and certainly not a thermos, cup or anything bulky.  That said, it is nearly impossible to get anything Bob the Builder these days and I'm still happy to have purchased this lunchbox.",1389830400,,306,4.350877192982456
8355188,5,B0027W6HJ2,"I just received this yesterday and haven't given it to my son yet for his birthday, but I know he'll love it. I read a review that said it is only large enough to hold the 3 DVDs it comes with, but it is actually larger. It is shrink wrapped and ""squished"" a bit, so at first it looks that way, but you can smooth out the sides and get more depth. I fit 5 DVDs cases plus a blue ray case inside. I'm leaving it that way until his birthday so it will have a better shape to it and ""stretch out"". I can't say much for how it lasts since we haven't used it yet, but I think it's perfect for the price ($12), especially with the 3 DVDs. I think if you were to constantly stuff it really full then the seems would tear open, but it looks like it will hold up fine with normal use. The sides, back and handle are solid orange, which doesn't show well in the picture. I'm definitely happy with the purchase and can't wait to hear my son say, ""Bob!!!"" when he opens it on his birthday :-)",1389225600,,980,3.9545454545454546
