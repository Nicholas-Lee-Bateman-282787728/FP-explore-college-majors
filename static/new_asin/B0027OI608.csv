8354959,4,B0027OI608,I Love Nathan Clarke George's music and lyrics especially his Psalms and hymns. My kids loved watching this video about his godly family and loved singing with his kids. We watched this in our van every time the van was turned on for quite a while.,1426291200,2,248,4.413043478260869
