8325913,4,B000XYJU7C,"This is the first review I've ever posted here or on any site, but given that there are no reviews on this DVD right now, I felt I had to post one. I just got my first didge in mid May, along with this DVD. This was the only instructional material I purchased at the time, and in just a few short weeks, I learned circular breathing and basic rhythms (well before the end of May). I don't play any other instrument except for the djembe (very informally), so I'm confident that anyone else could learn as quickly as me. This instructional video, by Rob Thomas and Tanya Gerard of didgeridoo trance group Inlakesh, is truly excellent. I feel that the section on bird and animal sounds could be a bit more thorough, as well as some of the more advanced rhythms, but everything else is exceedingly thorough. You're able to actually see the instructors' mouth and lip motions without the didgeridoo in the way for each of the pieces demonstrated. Then you get to hear what it sounds like when played through the didge. This is excellent for beginners!",1306886400,4,1047,4.515789473684211
