8660050,5,B00KMIS1VA,"Love this movie! I paid more then I wanted but I can't say I'm unhappy because it's a good movie. It's called, ""Scorpion in Love"" and since I'm a big fan of IR relationships, I naturally assumed the title of the movie spoke for itself. However, what makes this movie so good is that Julian does fall in love but it's boxing that he falls in love with FIRST, the relationship with Alyssa comes later. Also Javier Bardem was creepy but he did really good. Hosea became a mentor/father figure for Julien and they had really good chemistry. I loved this movie so I was happy with my purchase.",1428710400,,588,4.4036697247706424
