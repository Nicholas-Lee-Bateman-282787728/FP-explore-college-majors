8699720,4,B00SXFIJ02,"Lovejoy (no ""Mr."", just Lovejoy)) is one off the best TV series I've ever watched.  All of  the characters and writing are fantastic!  I'm sooooo looking forward to watching all of the episodes again.  'Short-term' memory loss is such a wonderful thing to have, in situations like this.",1491350400,,286,4.895833333333333

8699726,5,B00SXFIJ02,"So long Lovejoy! It's bittersweet to experience this final season of this fun series (and hard to imagine that the very first season aired in 1986 but didn't resume till several years later) Ian McShane's signature character remains a clever joy to watch, as he schemes and dreams for his antiquing team as they're on the hunt for finds, or frauds. His clashes with auctioneer Charlotte add spice to the tales, and as always, the big score that seems within grasp is just slightly, possibly, out of reach. An art theft accusation, a kidnapping, a mysteriously absent Tinker with a mystery of his own, a baby and a wedding (almost!) make up just a few of the storylines in this season. As always, guest stars are fun to spot in different roles, such Martin Jarvis ( Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and Julia Sawatha (Lark Rise in Candleford) In this last season, two original characters, Eric and Lady Jane (Chris Jury, Phyllis Logan) reappear in the finale. Knowing this is Lovejoy's final adventure prompts a sigh, but it's also a reminder to start over at the beginning.---unless Lovejoy returns someday with an ebay store and a Pintrest board! Acorn's slick and stylish remastering of the original films gives the series a timeless look, and makes Lovejoy a great retreat to a time before texts and tweets and technology all chipped away at suspenseful, fun acting. A toast to Lovejoy, a fave for the ages.",1435104000,3,1406,4.766393442622951
8699727,5,B00SXFIJ02,"The finale season has some of the better written episodes of all six seasons. About the only cast change from the last series is Lovejoy's long-overdue haircut. This Lovejoy set, first aired in 1994, is 2015 Series 6. Nostalgic Brit drama based on antiques, not traditional crime. Lovejoy (Ian McShane) is a likable rogue dealer of antiquities. He's a divvy (aka gifted spotter of antique value) sometimes bordering on unlawful, occasionally charmed sleuth. I love antiques shopping, thus this series is a treasure. LOOSELY based on Jonathan Gash novels; as it has now taken on a life of its own.

Regular cast (characters all exquisitely developed) includes ""Tink"" (Dudley Sutton -`Beiderbecke' trilogy) a gin divvy, and assistant Beth (Diane Parish). Charlotte (Caroline Langrishe), both antique auctioneer & Lovejoy lover. Multiple guest stars of the 90s-to-today appear in each episode (a few of my favorites noted below.)

SDH SUBTITLES for all episodes (each 50 minutes)
[Ep1]  Fair Exchange --Drink-stupored Lovejoy is charged as Charlotte's assaulter and oil painting thief. Amnesia or framed? [Excuse the art pun] Clive Russell is one guest star.
[Ep2]  Day of Reckoning --A vengeful murderer (John Castle -`Lillie') threatens to kill Charlotte to get to Lovejoy. Guest stars include: David Ryall (`The Village'; also appears in ep #10) and Alastair ""Sam"" Mackenzie (`Monarch of the Glen' `Wolf Hall' who appears in his 1dt year of acting.)
[Ep3]  Somewhere - Over the Rainbow? -Dejected Tink bolts after Lovejoy ridicules him over a botched appraisal. Guests: Richard Vernon (`Duchess of Duke Street'), Ursula Howells (`Cazalets'), & Erich Redman in his very first role.
[Ep4]  Double Edged Sword --Whymark's (Julian Glover -`Wish Me Luck') stolen 18th Century samurai sword is to be found by Lovejoy... or else. Also guesting: Julia Sawalha (`lark Rise to Candleford' `Crafford').
[Ep5]  Guns and Roses -A gunsmith (Allan Surtees) and Lovejoy are framed for robbery while Lovejoy is agent to a watercolor forger. Jonathan Coy (`H. Hornblower' `Downton Abbey').
[Ep6]  The Last of the Uzkoks -Who has previously owned the Greek communion bread bin? Uzkoks were Christian pirates of late Middle Ages. Patrick Ryecart (`King's Speech' 'Poldark') is among several guest stars.
[Ep7]  Breaking the Broker -A cop (Gary Waldhorn -`Vicar of Dibley') frames Tinker to get Lovejoy's help to catch a smuggler. Another guest: Martin Jarvis (`Forsyte Saga').
[Ep8]  Fruit of the Desert --Islamic artifacts for sale, but Lovejoy is skint. A loan shark takes Lovejoy's kid's (Amelia Curtis -`The Syndicate' `At Home with the Braithwaites') flat as collateral. Amelia as Viki will also appear in final episode 10.
[Ep9]  Holding the Baby -Beth's conned into giving away Lovejoy's latest windfall buy cabinet. Charlotte babysits, and two plots join.
[Ep10] Last Tango in Lavenham --Tink's shifting from antiques to a pub. Lovejoy proposes just as former flame Lady Jane (Phyllis Logan -`Downton Abbey') returns. Eric (Chris Jury) also adds to the series finale, flush with flashbacks. Another guest is Shelagh McLeod (`Wish Me Luck'). A fitting Lovejoy end.

Even 20 years after the Lovejoy series ended, it is equal to contemporary British Comedy Drama TV. Well worth owning all 6 seasons. I recommend the improved resolution of the 2015 release which also includes subtitles. Need all six seasons?
