While my following review is about ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion"", for some VERY strange reason my review appears in the review sections for not only ""Castle of illusion"", but for OTHER Spirit Warrior films listed on Amazon as well. I don't know why, but my review (along with the other seven reviews in this review section) appear in the review sections for most of the other Spirit Warrior movies. Very strange since all five movies in the Spirit Warrior series are VERY different from each other. In the following paragraphs, AFTER I explain how this film is NOT a Steven Seagal film in my next paragraph below (since, for some VERY strange reason, ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion"" and many of the other Spirit Warrior movies are listed as live action Steven Seagal films by Amazon) starting in my THIRD paragraph I will give a quick overview of the ENTIRE five part Spirit Warrior series in an effort to clear up any confusion between the five films. Afterwards, I will review ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion"".
END OF DISCLAIMER.

Let me begin by saying that ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion"" (along with the other ""Spirit Warrior"" anime films)is a great movie and it's rather sad to see people give this a one star rating because they were expecting to receive a live action movie with Steven Seagal in it. I know someone on this site screwed up and listed this as a Steven Seagal movie. It's NOT. It's a ""rated R"" anime (""japanese made cartoon"", for those of you who don't know what an anime is)from the late 80's. Don't take your frustrations out on the movie and give the movie a one star rating because it's not a live action Steven Seagal movie you were expecting. Go complain to whoever is in charge of listing the actors and directors on all the movies on this site and get them to change the information that is attached to this movie, don't take it out on the movie and give the movie one star because it's not a live action Steven Seagal movie. Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion is an R-rated anime that has nothing to do with Steven Seagal.

Also, BEFORE I begin my review of ""Spirit Warrior: Castle of illusion"", let me clear up some confusion about the Spirit Warrior anime series.

OVERVIEW OF THE ENTIRE SPIRIT WARRIOR SERIES :

In Japan, the series real name is Kujaku Oh (sometimes spelled ""Kujaku O"" by some people). Kujuka Oh started out as a Manga (which is a Japanese comic book) in 1985 and SOME of the comic issues were adapted for a five part Anime (Japanese made cartoon) movie series which began in 1988 and concluded in 1994 with it's last film (each of the five films are about 50 minutes). Over here in the United States (and other parts of the world) the anime series has been renamed.

Over here in the United states (and in some other areas around the world outside of Japan) when the series was released as a five part VHS movie series, it was called ""Peacock King"" (with Spirit Warrior in smaller letters under the Peacock King name). A few years later, when they released this series as DVDs in the United States, they dropped the ""Peacock King"" name and just called the series ""Spirit Warrior"". The five part VHS series is the SAME thing as the five part DVD series, they are just titled differently.

In all five of the anime movies, as well as the manga (manga are Japanese comic books) the MAIN character and hero to the entire saga is a young man by the name of Kujaku.

Also, just to clear something else up, despite ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion"" being considered the fourth movie in the Spirit Warrior series by the company who put this movie out in the United States, it's actually the SECOND part. The company in charge of putting this five part series out in the United States totally switched around the order of the movies.

The following is the CORRECT order of the five Spirit Warrior movies :

1) Spirit Warrior : Festival of the Ogres' Revival (despite being the third released film, it's actually part one).

2) Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion (despite being the fourth released film, it's actually part two)

3) Spirit Warrior : A Harvest of Cherry Blossoms (despite being the fifth released film, it's actually part three).

4) Spirit Warrior : Revival of Evil (despite being the first released film, it's actually part four).

5) Spirit Warrior : Regent of Darkness (despite being the second released film, and even being called ""Peacock King : Spirit Warrior 2"" for the earlier VHS release, it's actually part five in the series).

On a side note, I've watched ALL five movies and enjoyed them ALL. I liked ""Castle of illusion"" a LOT since it cleared up a LOT of things that I was exposed to when I was younger while playing the Sega Genesis game Mystic Defender (that game is based off of ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion""). However, the whole series is a LOT of fun to watch and I recommend the entire five part series.

My favorite Spirit Warrior movie? It's a three way tie. ""Castle of illusion"" and ""the Revival of Evil"" / ""Regent of Darkness"" two-parter (those two films are one big story, so you MUST watch them back to back) are ALL really fantastic. If you have a limited budget, then at least check out ""Castle of illusion"", and the two part ""Revival of Evil"" / Regent of Darkness"" movies since they are the best in the series.
The other Spirit Warrior film called ""Festival of Ogres' revival is also really good. In my opinion, the weakest movie was ""Harvest of Cherry Blossoms"" (it's actually a GOOD movie, but the other four Spirit Warrior anime movies were better and there is a scene in ""Harvest of the Cherry Blossoms"" which seriously bothered me). Overall, ALL five parts are worth watching and I recommend them all.

Aside from the five part anime series, there have been TWO Spirit Warrior video games released on American shores.
The LATE 1989 Sega Genesis game ""Mystic Defender"" is directly based on the Spirit Warrior movie ""Castle of illusion"".

For some of you who played the Sega Genesis game (and actually remember the names of the characters) and haven't seen the movie ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion"", just like the Sega Genesis ""Fist of the North Star"" game which was renamed ""Last Battle"" and renamed all the characters, all the characters in the ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion"" game (which was named ""Mystic Defender"" by Sega of America) were renamed in Mystic Defender. Here is a quick list of the characters and what their REAL names are in this movie :

Sega Genesis names VS Original names (all of which are present in the ""Spirit Warrior"" movies and even the Manga / comic)

Joe Yamato = Kujaku (the main character of the entire series)

Alexandria = Asura (she plays a major role in the entire series)

Zareth = Nobunaga (main human villain with the mustache, cape and sword and is the boss called ""Zareth"" in the game)

There are other characters, but I figure I should only list the three main people that appear in both the movies and game.
On another note : There are two MAJOR characters in the Spirit Warrior series which don't appear in the Mystic Defender video game (despite playing MAJOR roles in the movie ""Castle of illusion"" and other Spirit Warrior movies) but appear in another Spirit Warrior game that was released in the United States BEFORE Mystic Defender.

There was a video game released in EARLY 1989 called ""SpellCaster"" which was a side scrolling action RPG which appeared on the Sega Master System (Sega's system before the Genesis). In that game, the character Onimaru (the muscle-bound guy with the sun glasses who plays a major role in the Spirit Warrior series by helping Kujaku ..... most of the time) is renamed Jukak.

Meanwhile, Kujaku (who was renamed Joe Yamato in Mystic Defender) is called Kane in the game Spellcaster. So yes, Kujaku is known as Kane in the Spellcaster game. Sega, for whatever reason, LOVED changing the names of characters and the names of licensed franchises for American audiences back in their early years (they did the same thing to all the Fist of North Star games they produced). Also, Master Jiku (the old master from the Spirit Warrior movies) is called Daikak in the game SpellCaster. In case you are wondering, Asura and Nobunaga do NOT appear in SpellCaster. The story that is presented in Spellcaster is NOT from any of the five anime Spirit Warrior movies, but it is from several of the events that occurred during the Spirit Warrior manga (japanese comic book).

SpellCaster and Mystic Defender games are all really Spirit Warrior games, it's just that Sega renamed the hell out of the entire franchise for American audiences and censored out some of the more controversial parts of the story (especially in SpellCaster since that game was an action RPG, unlike Mystic Defender which was all action).

FINALLY, before I get to my review of ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion"", it should be noted that there are TWO live action movies to this franchise that are about an hour and a half each. They were released in 1989 and 1990 and due to them NOT being dubbed in English (unlike the five part anime movie series which uses English voice actors), you must be willing to read English subtitles to understand the live action films.

I won't describe the live action films in full detail due to space limitations, but I will say this : the first live action film was called ""Peacock King"" and the second live action film was called ""Saga of the Phoenix"" (yes, they renamed the franchise again. LOL).

Now, let's FINALLY get to that review about ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion"" :

REVIEW :

For those of you who have played ""Mystic Defender"" on a Sega Genesis, that game is based off the anime movie ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion"" (which I will be reviewing today). If you have played the Genesis game ""Mystic Defender"", you will FINALLY get the REAL back story behind most of the bosses from the game since they play VERY important roles in the story to this anime movie. You will also experience several other parts of the story to this movie which were censored out of the game's story.

If you have NEVER played ""Mystic Defender"", you will STILL enjoy this great film. Also, you'll probably want to play Mystic Defender after seeing this awesome movie.

I don't want to give any of the MAJOR parts of the plot away, but I will say this : it might be a little on the controversial side for some of you. Some of the bad guys (like the second level bosses from the Mystic Defender game who turn into spiders and also appear in a later level. They play a HUGE role in this movie) are VERY religious, but not in the way that you might think. They read from another version of the bible called ""The accursed bible"", which is basically hell's version if the bible (which features it's OWN original material which is VERY different from the christian bible you may know). Some of the bad guys even have a REVERSE crucifix around their necks (instead of Jesus, it features whats suppose to be Satan (in a human form) hanging upside down from hell's version of the crucifix. This is suppose to symbolize how the devil (a fallen angel) fell from heaven in the original bible). As you may imagine, the good guys are VERY much against the bad guys in this series.

If you are okay with this subject material (and keep in mind that the good guys are very much against the bad guys and their ""accursed bible"" and reverse crucifix, so it's NOT like the movie is saying that stuff is okay, it's VERY much against it) then you will be okay with this movie. It's a very well done movie with a very cool story to it. Especially when they reveal the history behind each of the bad guys. It's a very awesome moment.

The story telling in this anime movie is awesome. As for the animation, it's VERY nicely detailed and well animated (in my opinion, Japanese animation from the late 80's to early 90's was the BEST, and this is no exception). The animation here is VERY high quality.

As for the voice acting, I really liked the English voice actors in ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion"". I have no complaints against the English voice actors.

Another thing you should be aware of when buying this movie is that it contains R-rated violence (lots of blood and dismemberment) and it does contain full nudity featuring a female.

Anyway, if you are okay with R-rated violence and full female nudity, then you'll be okay with this movie. Strangely enough, NO major curse words are used at all, so the language is pretty tame. But be aware that the violence is ""R-rated"" and the nudity features a FULLY nude blond woman running around towards the end. This is NOT a kids film. Neither is the rest of the Spirit Warrior movies (especially one of the other Spirit Warrior films called ""Harvest of the Cherry Blossoms"", which features a very severe rape scene that pushes the ""R"" rating. In case you are wondering, there are NO sex scenes in ""Castle of illusion"", despite the full female nudity).

Overall, the characters in ""Castle of illusion"" are awesome and each one has their own personalities. Kujaku (who is the main character in all the Spirit Warrior movies) is a great hero.

With that said, do you need to see any of the other movies to understand ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion""? Not at all. It's a stand alone story, despite being a direct sequel to ""Festival of the Ogres' revival"". You can still see ""Castle of illusion"" with no knowledge of the other films and have NO problems understanding what's going on.

I still highly recommend watching the anime movie ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion"". It's an awesome movie with a cool story.
If you have played the game ""Mystic Defender"", then be prepared to see the true, UNCENSORED version of the story and the back story and origin behind most of the villains (something which was never revealed in the Genesis game).

Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion is very much worth your time.
And in case you are wondering, Steven Seagal did NOT do any voice acting in this film and has NOTHING to do with this awesome movie (and has NOTHING to do with any of the other Spirit Warrior movies).",1362182400,4,14180,4.606661379857256

8011142,1,B0001EFUJQ,"It gives me no pleasure to write the subject line, above. I love Steven Seagal films. They tend to be exciting, have some snappy dialogue, and often have great villains (Henry Silva, Basil Wallace).

But let me digress for a moment. In the 1970s, there was a film, The Green Berets, that was called ""the worst film of all time."" I watched it recently and it wasn't half bad. After all, it had The Duke and Aldo Ray in it. No, this Seagal excuse for an environmental diatribe is insulting to environmentalists, to oil companies, to Alaskan natives, and to horses!

It portrays the Alaskans as so dumb that they claim horses came from the western hemisphere (they were introduced by the Spaniards).

I tried watching it recently, and could not finish it. It was just too dumb.

My recommendation: stay away. Watch Fire Down Below instead: good story, GREAT music, and good red-necky villains.",1161907200,4,890,4.72258064516129
