8446368,3,B004X6Z75U,"I was looking for Church history and now I realised that this is First days of Christianity.
Yes, watching this I have little problem if it was done by History Channel. Drama's included in this series some time
not very relevant in my understanding. This DVD set gives a basic understanding of early Church.
Thats fine and surely good for new people to Christianity. There are many other Church History DVD's are available.
These will really help young Christians. I am glad that I will be keeping in my library.",1404345600,,512,4.7

8446370,5,B004X6Z75U,"This is a great collection of documentaries from the History Channel and A&E about the early days of Christianity.  Unlike one of the other reviewers, I don't recall any time being spent on any modern Christian mysteries.  This set mostly dealt with finding out more about the apostles, Jesus, Mary, and Paul.  I skipped around a little, so perhaps I missed something.  But overall, the documentaries are well done and are more like the older documentaries from the History Channel which are less obsessed with speculation (like Ancient Aliens) and more about real history.",1361232000,,573,5.0638297872340425
8446371,1,B004X6Z75U,"We are only on the 2nd of the 5 discs, but we are not happy with this purchase.  It seems as if the entire film budget was spent on Roger Moore's narration.  There are many re-enactments which are just horrible...my children could do a better job and make it look more authentic.  I wouldn't care so much, but it truly does detract from the message.  So far, (through the second disc) it pretty much just re-enacts unknown miracles; barren parents having a child after drinking a concoction made for the power of the ""milk grotto,"" a soldier surviving after a bullet hit the Bible in his chest pocket and stopped, a painting of Mary and Jesus helping shop owners through a difficult time, etc.  It does give some historical information on the dead sea scrolls and the gnostic gospels which was interesting, but that's about all we have gotten out of it so far.  I don't know if I would even recommend borrowing this from the library and investing the time.",1344988800,4,956,4.56140350877193
