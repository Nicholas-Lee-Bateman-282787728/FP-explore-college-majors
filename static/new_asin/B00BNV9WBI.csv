5660391,4,B00BNV9WBI,"This film is a reminder of the dangers of travel outside the USA.  The lead character is a barely recognizable Barbara Hershey.  She gets invited on a trip to Ecuador by a handsome man friend.  She has fun on the trip until time to leave, then she is accused of having packages of cocaine in her suitcase.  She is thrown into an Ecuadorian prison for 22 months.  Her daughter spends all her time and money trying to get her mom out of Ecuador.  It is based on a true story.
Worth a look.",1368662400,3,487,4.182795698924731

8571720,5,B00BNV9WBI,"This is based on a real story, which I find very interesting. My greatest compliments for a great movie, fabulous acting, and extremely interesting scenes. Even the deterioration of Ms Chase as she continues in prison is done very well.  Since this movie has an NR, I was somewhat hesitant to watch it. I have certain personal standards in movies, and don't care for excessive violence, cursing or sex scenes. While there was violence and sex scenes, they were done tastefully. I was surprised to find that this movie was such an intense drama without contrived, overdone scenes. The acting is outstanding, as good or even better than movies with much higher budgets. The story is simple, but told with great care and sensitivity. I am very glad that I watched this movie. It is well worth the time, and it is excellently done.",1383955200,3,827,4.743055555555555
