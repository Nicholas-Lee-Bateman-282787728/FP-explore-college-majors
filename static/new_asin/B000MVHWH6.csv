The second dvd

U LAKA LAKA LA
Carnaval La Habana 2003

The chorus ""U Laka Laka La"" was on everyone's lips in Carnaval La Habana 2003 - a call to dance, celebrate, and let it all hang out.

2003 was the 180th year anniversary of Carnaval La Habana, a spectacular festival that incorporates an extrordinary array of Cuba's diverse cultural traditions. For an entire week the city's Malecon seafront drive was awash with hot rhythms,color, and gyrating bodies, along with the rain showers and spray from the sea. The wind and rain were overwhelming at times, but carnaval prevailed and became its own force of nature, blending with the elements.

Parade groups known as comparsas, dominate carnaval, and are composed of a percussion section playing the conga rhythm, dancers in stunning costumes, and floats. Traditional groups, such as El Alacran (The Scorpion) have distinctive themes rooted in the cultural history of Cuba. Comparsas that have formed in more recent years, such as Los Guaracheros de Regla, rely on innovation and style to capture the public's heart.

Carnaval in Havana is a tropical deluge of color, gyrating hips, and vibrant drumming; the life blood of the Cuban people - a marvel to behold.
