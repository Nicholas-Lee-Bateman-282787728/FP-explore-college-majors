8468141,5,B005EDPA8K,"This is Eric Niderost. I highly recommend this to anyone who can remember Dr Baxter and the Bell Science films. It is detailed in my new book on Dr Baxter, SONNETS AND SUNSPOTS; DR RESEARCH BAXTER AND THE BELL SCIENCE FILMS, also available on AMAZON.
the second part of this film is a semi-travelogue produced by the Greyhound bus company, and featuring a young Angie Dickenson. Great nostalgic stuff...",1409961600,,403,4.855072463768116
8468142,5,B005EDPA8K,"OK. So you are all familiar with the Bell Science Series. You've even seen The Thread of Life which is about DNA and genes. But you've probably never seen Our Heritage. Our Heritage is roughly 30 minutes. It's not part of the Bell series, however it has that feel as it is narrated by Frank Baxter. Instead of science, Dr. Baxter teaches about the Declaration of Independence. If you're a fan of the Bell series, this rare Dr. Baxter appearance is a must.",1336435200,,455,4.493975903614458
