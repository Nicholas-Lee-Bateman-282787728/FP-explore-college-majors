2698651,5,B000KWZ1MU,It was better than I expected. Brought back memories from my childhood. The quality and color is very good. I would recommend this product to anyone who grew up with Sergeant Preston and Yukon King.,1393718400,8,198,4.685714285714286
2698652,5,B000KWZ1MU,I received these DVDs promptly and in good condition. I always enjoyed their adventures even though I am not a dog fan. Thank you.,1361491200,,130,4.458333333333333
2698653,5,B000KWZ1MU,"This lovely set is a MUST HAVE for geezers like me who grew up watching SERGEANT PRESTON shows Saturday mornings SO MANY, MANY SATURDAYS AGO.
These are ""detective"" shows of a sort, and Sgt. Preston ALWAYS GETS HIS MAN. I just love YUKON KING. No dog so loyal or clever than he. I LOVE HIM TO PIECES. What a pal!
If you enjoy Sergeant Yukon this is for you. The colour transfers are excellent considering that they date from the year of my birth (1955).  TIMELESS MEDIA GROUP, the producers of this set, did AN INCREDIBLE JOB. The quality is UNBELIEVABLY GOOD. They MADE THE EFFORT TO REPRODUCE THIS SHOW AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE AND THEY SUCCEEDED. Somehow they got hold of BEAUTIFUL COLOUR PRINTS. I MEAN FANTASTIC! And these people are so humble they have a disclaimer at the beginning of each disc stating there could be some imperfections in the transfers? IF ONLY ONE-TENTH OF THE VINTAGE TELEVISION DVD'S I BOUGHT WERE AS WELL MADE.
This is something extra special for people my age. It's fun, wholesome and so very entertaining. NOTHING LIKE IT TODAY. GOOD triumphs over EVIL. COOL CANADIAN MOUNTIES. COMPELLING STORIES! SWEEPING PANORAMAS! I highly recommend this set to you. It's what television should have been about all along. BUY THIS SET!  YOU'LL LOVE THE GORGEOUS TIN CONTAINER THAT IT COMES IN. A piece of art. The stuff dreams are made of.

""Well, King. This case is closed.""",1315958400,6,1387,4.699588477366255
2698654,5,B000KWZ1MU,This is one of the good shows that made you feel good about watching TV on Saturdays along with The Cisco Kid and Rin Tin Tin.,1312761600,3,126,3.8846153846153846
2698655,5,B000KWZ1MU,"The 2 DVD's are packaged in an embossed tin can - most impressive.
I never knew they were shot in colour as we only had B&W Tv then. The colour is a little light but very acceptable. Audio quality excellent. This is a pure baby-boomer nostalgia buy and excellent value for money. A big bonus is that it is ""Region Free"" so can be played on any DVD in the world. The storylines and acting are well, truly 1950's. But the mountie and his dog always got the baddies. It seems that was the theme of all those TV series then - good versus bad.",1273104000,16,538,4.133333333333334
2698656,5,B000KWZ1MU,"OK, so they're not really huskies and you never quite shake that infernal wind machine that's going every time anybody ever steps out of their studio mountain cabin (even though trees don't appear to be the least bit affected) but what 10 year-old kid (or nostalgia hungry old geezer) can't get excited about the real Richard Simmons? Role model of truth, justice and the American way among neighbors in the north (Canada) and a '50's fashion icon in his vibrant, military red coat. Solid, family-friendly entertainment from the fifties.

There was nothing suspect about this hero who talked to his dog in every episode ""well, King this case is closed"" and the world might be a better place today if there were more like him. At least we can recapture ""those thrilling days of yesteryear"" (yup, Fran Striker, brainchild behind the Lone Ranger TV series also had a hand in this one too) in a glossy, embossed tin that got us all outdoors. Ten color episodes on 2 dvds' are packaged here:

Disc One:""Crime at Wounded Moose"", ""Skagway Secret"",' ""Blind Justice"",
""Phantom of Phoenixville"", & ""Dog Race"".
Disc Two: ""One Bear Too Many"", ""Justice at Goneaway Creek"", ""Black Ace"", ""Relief Train"", & ""Trapped"".

Are these the best of the 3 seasons that were on TV and released? Having not seen the other shows for comparison, who knows? But one does wish that a little more love were put into this Timeless Video release. Typo on the tin (Disc One ""Dog Race"" not ""Dog Rade"") and 2 titles that do not match up with episodes also on Disc One. Come on guys, snap out of it. Give us product that is consistent with the image that is Sergeant Preston, Yukon King and Rex the Wonder Horse.

Mr. Simmons passed away several years ago here in California and I, for one, feel he deserves to be in a typo-free can with accurate episodes contained within.""I arrest my case in the name of the crown""!",1235433600,21,1879,4.650602409638554
2698657,5,B000KWZ1MU,"This was one of my favorite TV series. As a kid I used to watch this TV series every Saturday morning (along with the other great TV series like The Lone Ranger, Sky King, Rin Tin Tin, Kit Carson, etc). back in the 50s and early 60s. The DVD set is excellent and comes in a very attractive tin litho case, with the name and images of ""Sergeant Preston with Yukon King"" raised in 3-D on the lid.",1220659200,3,394,4.064102564102564
2698658,1,B000KWZ1MU,"Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi. I'm a good fan of classic TV and I can put up with a lot from public domain material with the scratches and pops and splices, etc. But this DVD which features 3 episodes from 1956 which are in color by the way, ""One Bean Too Many"", ""Phantom of Phoenixville"" and ""Trapped"" just tested my patience.

In the first episode the colors are melded together and the upper left half of the screen is just dark with a red color. The second episode was the best looking and the third episode looked like a lens wasn't cleaned with all sorts of spots everywhere. I'm lucky I didn't pay much for it as I bought it at a retail outlet where everything is a buck. This series starring Richard Simmons, (no, not that Richard Simmons) along with his horse Rex and dog Yukon King had the job of patroling the northwest Yukon of Canada.

Hopefully, someone will someday do a decent job of restoration and releasing this series. Until then, skip the nostalgia on this one. It just isn't worth it. :(",1093824000,16,994,4.456043956043956
8159398,4,B000KWZ1MU,Great old stories. Brings back wonderful memories. Love it in color. Only major flaw is that the clarity leaves the picture fuzzy and looking out of focus. Otherwise 5 stars.,1472428800,2,174,4.833333333333333

8159405,4,B000KWZ1MU,"It was made to appeal to kids. For kids I'd give it 5 stars as long as they unplug their electronic toys and use their imagination. For adults, I bought it to remember my youth and all the TV shows I watched in the 1950s. He was a heroic figure in those days and most kids in my small town wanted to be Davy Crocket, a cowboy, soldier, fireman, or Mountie.",1414022400,,356,4.028169014084507
