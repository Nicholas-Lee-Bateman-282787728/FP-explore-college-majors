8344268,4,B001R5GHO0,"Jag Mundhra is an underestimated Film-maker, not till you see ""Shoot on Sight"". This is a bold venture for any Film-maker because of the content-but Mundhra cleverly dissects the message. The Script was tight with some great dialog. Om Puri, is good in whatever he does since he has this diction which comes handy for a Preacher/Imam/Military Commander or any Character that he may chose to portray. Nasirudeen Shah is just great. The background music was good. I was impressed by the movie since it had no dull moments. The direction by Mundhra was an ace. It was very clever to have the British Characters speak (or dub) in Hindi and English. This makes it appealing to the narration. I enjoyed watching this movie setting aside the underlying sentiments.",1301961600,,757,4.875968992248062
