PLEASE I WANT THIS FILM ON DVD BY UNIVERSAL. Because Universal owns the 1957-59 RKO films that the studio end up distributing back then along with Jet Pilot (1957). Remember this film Escapade In Japan (1957) is a good movie to watch, while looking at Japan back in 1957.",1407369600,2,482,4.616279069767442

The back of the box suggests it might be region-free, but look closer and it says PAL Zona 2. The disc itself is marked Region 2. And it would not play in my regular DVD player. Too bad.
So far as the movie itself goes, I agree with the earlier reviews. I really enjoyed it.",1389744000,,409,3.9397590361445785

8054081,5,B0007Y7TD0,"[NOTE: Please be aware that the image that is on this page with ""CLINT EASTWOOD"" at the top is completing misleading. Clint Eastwood is NOT the star of this film. He has what amounts to a cameo and it was made before he became a major player. The ""stars"" of this movie were supposed to be Teresa Wright and Cameron Mitchell, but the real stars were Jon Provost of ""Lassie"" fame and Roger Nakagawa in his first and only film. Following is a review of the VHS version, and I am not sure why it is listed on this page of the DVD version, because I never saw that one. Amazon should take down the image with Clint Eastwood as it is misleading.]

This is a unique film that is a must-see for anyone who has an interest in postwar Japan. It stars an amazing Jon (""Lassie"") Provost, who was just seven when this film was made. It is not brilliant, but the story of an American boy and a Japanese boy who end up running all over Japan trying to escape what they believe will be a problem with the police definitely touches the heart.

It is miraculous that Jon and Roger Nakagawa (his first and only performance) carry this film,  considering how much is asked of them. It is also a wondrous up-close look at Japan just 12 years after WWII. For people at that time, this must have been an amazing travelogue. Now, it would be considered quaint, perhaps even schmaltzy with the labored ""B"" story between Jon's screen parents, Teresa Wright and Cameron Mitchell.

Nonetheless, it covers quite a bit of territory that had never been seen on film before, and, more importantly, is still difficult to find on film because the Japanese are incredibly restrictive about movies being made in their country. Even the famous ""Lost in Translation"" did plenty of guerilla filmmaking, despite Sophia Coppola's high profile pedigree.

Definitely worth a view.",1230940800,8,1837,4.588414634146342
8054082,4,B0007Y7TD0,"Escapade In Japan is a good family adventure about an American boy (Jon Provost, who played Timmy Martin on Lassie) who survives a plane crash in the sea of Japan.  He's picked up by a fishing boat, and afraid he'll be blamed for the plane crash and turned over to police, he runs away with the help of the fisherman's boy.  Together they flee across Japan, and one of the movie's strengths is the exploration of many facets of Japanese country and culture - in color - rare in a film of the 1950s.  Meanwhile the boy's parents, Teresa Wright and Cameron Mitchell, frantically search for him.  Clint Eastwood has a bit part, one of his first.",1172102400,8,642,4.461538461538462
