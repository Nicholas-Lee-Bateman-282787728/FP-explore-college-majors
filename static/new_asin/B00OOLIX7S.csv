6758139,4,B00OOLIX7S,"An excellent ""Western"", this one set in Austria. Very good revenge tale, but with one glaring flaw in the storyline. ***Spoiler Alert***
Halfway through the film, the hero has the perfect opportunity to kill all the bad guys at once, but he lets them go & tells them to meet him the next morning, supposedly for a ""proper"" shootout. What is this, a high-school rumble? If you have an opportunity to take out your enemy, you do it. You don't give them a chance to sneak up on you the next morning.",1417737600,4,496,4.4021739130434785
6758140,1,B00OOLIX7S,"Really bad! A very slow start, unclear story, depressing. For example, the main character takes his time shaving in a bowl of semi-frozen water. Now that is suspense.",1417392000,4,166,4.964285714285714

6758147,4,B00OOLIX7S,"Nice little western.  Its in German, wish it was not dubed into English, would have preferred subtitles instead.

It has a little spaghetti, and some elements of American western with its own unique twist regarding a Highland type of feeling.

Development is slow, but steady, beautiful scenery, looked great on my tv.

Hoping this Sam Riley does some more westerns.  He carried a core of dark but honorable trait to his character, and you don't see that much anymore.  Clint Eastwood pulled that off quite well.

Enjoy.",1520294400,,520,4.908045977011494

6758151,4,B00OOLIX7S,"What should I call a spaghetti western from Austria?  Anyone who liked ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" will like this.  It follows a traditional storyline.  A stranger in black from Texas rides into a small town.  His pack animals carry strange packages.  He is stopped by local thugs.  However, the town is in Germany and, instead of a Gatling gun, the stranger has a camera.  The most notable change in this story is the stranger's great advantage is patient planning instead of a lightning draw.  I have to question the choice of music in one action sequence, but that may just be because I'm old.",1520035200,,594,4.699029126213592
6758152,5,B00OOLIX7S,"I  love Sam Riley and I love this movie.  Once I saw Andreas Prochaska the Director, I knew I was in for a treat.  I have to say, my stomach was in a knot from the beginning to the end.  The story line was brooding with the arival of the dark stranger, 3/4 through when you learn of the nature of his visit...POW! It begins!  People complaining about the dubbing....really? I prefer foreign films with subtitles, but I have to say, the dubbing was pretty spot on for it originally being in German.  Love it, may watch it again on a rainy day.",1519948800,,542,4.213592233009709
6758153,5,B00OOLIX7S,Great western. Was better in Austrian with English subtitles though. The undubbed version was even grittier and the characters were darker. The English overdub was weak with the voices not matching the characters. Great movie though. If you get a chance to watch the undubbed original please do.,1519862400,,295,5.166666666666667
6758154,5,B00OOLIX7S,"If you are mature enough to appreciate a foreign film that is dubbed into English, this one is a gem. A great Western, even though the plot is set in a mountain village in Bum-screw Bavaria(In-bred Appalachia equivalent.) Great acting and a believable story if you think about how weird shit probably happened in the days before running water and Mini-Marts. Seriously, though, this is worth your time if you like a good Western revenge story. The lead actor, Sam Riley, and lead actress, Paula Beer, who is a real babe, more than carry the story, they keep it moving and then some. I could see Sam Riley doing the remake of ""Then Came Bronson."" Paula Beer, besides being my favorite beverage, is someone I will look forward to seeing in more movies.",1519776000,3,750,4.646616541353383
6758155,1,B00OOLIX7S,"another movie about revenge but very weak action, dull play, I will not even tell not to watch it because your gut will tell you to stop watching after about first 60 secs.

6758156,5,B00OOLIX7S,"Well done, instead of all beautiful people it was average people that had their own beauty.  Made it more real.  No one perfect all flawed in their own way.  Not a constant action movie but a mixture more like life.  Art.",1519776000,,221,4.317073170731708
6758157,4,B00OOLIX7S,"A German film dubbed in English (decent dubbing). The setting is in the mountains of Austria.  In this mountainous town lives a small group of people who live under the rules of one elderly man and his six sons.  No one in town is allowed to carry guns except the ruling family.  The town people all pull their weight to make life possible in this town.  Who gets to move in or out of this town, and who gets to marry is controlled by the elder of the ruling family.  One outrageous law of this town is that any one getting married, the bribe must be given to the elderly for his pleasure on the wedding night.  Anyone who doesn't obey this law, the family's home can be burnt down and the groom can be hanged on a cross until he is eaten away by the birds.

One day a man comes to this town claiming to be a photographer from the United States and wanting to record the town's people and environment for the winter.  The town's people are curious about the camera technology and the young man pays well to be hosted by the town.  So, they let him stay only to experience a change that the town people were looking for, but not the elder and his family.  This has the feel of a cowboy movie, but it has a good story once you understand the background as to why the photographer is in the town.",1519603200,3,1293,4.156626506024097

6758160,1,B00OOLIX7S,"This gets 1 star because Amazon decided to deceive people and telling them it is in English, but in fact it is dubbed. I knew the acting was not on par with what ever small part of the movie I did watch, which looked good. This movies language is German, dubbed in English. The dub-over sounds like a bunch of amateur voice over talent who can't act. More ways Amazon deceives. Instead of telling people up front and they can decide if they want subtitles, Amazon attempts to lead people to believe it's in English. I rate movies based in large part on how well the acting is.",1519603200,2,576,4.342592592592593

6758162,5,B00OOLIX7S,"This is a FINE movie...everything about it works!  I was drawn in immediately.  It'a grim story, so well done. I thought the dubbing was almost perfect.  It certainly didn't interfere or distract from the film.  The acting was GOOD!  Not overplayed due to the drama of the plot.  Don't miss it.",1519430400,,294,4.666666666666667
6758163,4,B00OOLIX7S,"I think the description of this is a little off. To me it's about what happens when a small group or individual holds power over others, including in this case all the guns. It also speaks to freedom and the lack thereof.",1519430400,,221,4.285714285714286

The film is dubbed, but I like that better than subtitles, since you can focus on the acting instead of trying to read what is being said.  As westerns go, I give this a 5 star.",1519171200,,338,4.301587301587301
6758171,1,B00OOLIX7S,"Grainy high contrast video.  I guess to make it ""gritty"".  Just came off as cheap to me.

6758172,4,B00OOLIX7S,"Well done German/Austrian revenge western.  I don't normally like anachronistic music in period pieces, but it seemed to fit the mood.  Particularly in a shootout scene with the brothers toward the end.  Powerful scene that stuck with me.  Loved the cinematography.  The story itself is reminiscent of Pale Rider.  Mysterious stranger on a mission of revenge.  Think I would enjoy it better with subtitles to catch the nuance in the actual language.  4 stars for well done story, direction, acting.  Only flaw, and not really much of one, was the lack of explanation as to why the brothers thought they had the advantage in the shootout scene.  I caught that he had a repeating rifle.  Did I miss a scene earlier that explained their ignorance of the rifle's existence?",1518998400,2,769,4.883720930232558

6758174,4,B00OOLIX7S,"My husband was in the mood for a Western, and picked this film after watching the trailer. The story line is not really a new one. A young American photographer returns to the village in Austria where his mother was brutalized as a young woman, seeking vengeance. There are some mildly graphic, fairly realistic injury scenes and violence, and some adult subject matter. No nudity, or extreme foul language. My hubby gave this film 4 stars, I give it 3 - 3.5.",1518912000,2,459,4.609756097560975

6758176,4,B00OOLIX7S,"Excellent Movie.  I have read some of the reviews.  I too hate dubbed movies.  However, this one is not that bad.  Actually, they did a decent job with the exception of one guy.  I didn't let that bother me.  Great acting and film quality.  Excellent story.  It's hard to find good movies when you have watch so many.  Love this one!!  Love Clint Eastwood?...then you will like this movie.  No one liners but the lead is quiet and strong.",1518825600,4,438,4.417721518987341
6758177,3,B00OOLIX7S,"An AMAZING movie, in the ORIGINAL language w/ subtitles, but this English overdub is the pits--think extra-low budget spaghetti western voiceovers.

6758179,3,B00OOLIX7S,I'd give this 3 1/2 stars.  The entire mood of the film from the cast to the settings is gray and oppressive.  However the storyline is unique enough and the acting competent enough to keep me engaged.  And there is enough gun action for this to be a proper Western.  I feel it's worth at least one watch.,1518739200,,305,4.206896551724138

6758183,2,B00OOLIX7S,"This movie cannot be rated a five which would put it among the best movies of all time - or at least on the ""free prime"" list.  Going down the list, the directing is OK, maybe a 3-4 considering the cast.  The story is abysmally worn out, nothing about it works, a low ""1"":  remote town of about  75 in the high country, so remote that the ""stranger"" entering town is an event but yet a thriving full-service western town economy, an evil town ruler who runs the town like a medieval lord exercising his right of ""prima nochta"" until the chosen one becomes pregnant (although present time there is but one young (under 40) woman present, the ""stranger"" is the vengeful son of a woman who the narrator tells us miraculously escaped 25-30+ years earlier and returns for a reason which we are left to guess (no one from that time has aged), the ""stranger"" is ostensibly a photographer but a skilled killer emerges to save the day for that young lady (early 20's) who is has been left inexplicably unmolested all these years until she and another young man (the only one) decide to marry which triggers the snatching-away, sons of evil lord and the evil lord are killed by stranger with the young suitor appearing miraculously to shoot one son in the back to save the stranger and enable him to complete his killing spree, finished off with a riding off into the sunset.

6758185,1,B00OOLIX7S,"I've seen a lot of dubbed kung fu movies in my time... at least their voices sound like they were recorded live action. This movie's voice track sounds like it was recorded in the NPR radio studio... monotone, to close to the mic and without emotion. The sound track is not acted out. Why isn't this noted in the description? Why does Amazon try to shove foreign films down or throats by mixing them in with the domestic films? Give them their own category and stop wasting our time looking through this garbage to find a decent movie to watch!!! Is that too much to ask? If I can't count on the entertainment value of the prime movie service, I'm going to have to turn to alcohol and opioids to find my escape. Is that what you want, Amazon, to contribute to the further decay of society through alcohol and opioid abuse? Give us a fair shake here and quit getting our hopes up for a great movie we somehow missed only to crush us with disappointment because it's actually a piece of crap made in NOT Hollywood.
And shame on you fools who gave this a 4 or 5 Star rating. You're part of the problem. You're probably all hipsters.",1518307200,7,1129,4.355450236966824

Great western genre movie set in the Austrian alps. However, the English language over dubbing is just horrible, so I can't recommend watching this movie as is on Amazon. It's not just the dubbing itself that makes it bad, it's *the BAD voice acting* that really sets it apart: dull, flat, amateurish. I'd rather watch this great movie in German w/o subtitles than with the dubbing; the movie is good enough on it's own to tell a great story and even if you don't understand German, there's more than enough emotion to convey the important parts.

TL; DR: Great movie, really bad English over dubbing, no subtitles available, no native German track available. Watch it, just not on Amazon.",1518220800,,742,4.880952380952381

If I had to compare it to other recent ones it is definitely better than ""magnificent 7"" ""hateful eight"" and ""the revenant"" combined. It didn't make me feel like there was a lull in the story or that there were filler scenes. Much better in original German with subtitles, then in dubbed English... the dubbed dialogue made it feel less quality and that the emotional vocal cues were missing from the dialogue, but because there aren't many conversations it does take too much away from the film.

A decent movie. Might be good to watch during a hot day since it is an atmosphere of cold weather and you can hear the sound of snow crunching under feet and hooves. (if you enjoy rain and overcast, The Killing series has nothing but! )
I had to reset from the default dubbed version so I could hear the original German language. Dubbing is usually so laughable.
These days, since everything has been done, and done more than once, it's satisfying to watch a movie that has decent entertainment value and doesn't pander to the crazy Liberal Agenda.
I applaud any production which doesn't kneel before the Democrat Liberal Agenda god for the ""progressive"" with the intent of forcing anti-Christian, anti-famiy, atheistic radical feminist values, etc"" on children, the unwary and easily misled. It will be an ironic day when Islam assumes Sharia law in America!. Hopefully, Americans will wise up before it's too late.
(BTW- There is every reason to include politics in media reviews. Too many movies are stacked with liberal political bias and intent to convert!

6758224,3,B00OOLIX7S,"Revenge flicks are a staple of the film industry. I'm guessing there is a vicarious thrill for the viewer who entertains the thought of doing horrible things to someone who done them wrong. This is an okay entry into the genre.

Here's the scoop. A mysterious, German speaking American shows up in a small, remote village tucked away in a valley in Germany. He's a photographer but something else is afoot.

This is a beautifully lensed film. It's set in the late 19th century and you believe it. the buildings, the clothes and other details are all spot on. But, from what is shown in the opening scene, and then early in the subsequent scenes, there is little doubt as to where this is headed. So the trick is to make it deep or make it really clever. Unfortunately, neither happens. The good guy has little depth and the bad guys, the family who runs the town, are little more than cardboard cutouts. There is one (somewhat) clever killing, but that's about it. It plays out in very straightforward fashion. Not enough tension or other things going wrong to throw a monkey in the wrench for the hero.

What's happening here is the look of it. You'd be hard pressed to find a prettier film, but that's about it. People can complain about Hollywood and their ""we don't make movies. We make deals"" approach to things but they do this sort of thing really well. This movie could have used a strong dose of that.

6758253,4,B00OOLIX7S,"Really a top notch ""western"" that isn't a western.

Watch the German language version with subtitles - it's much easier to follow than poor dubbing.

Das Finstere Tal (The Dark Valley) takes place in a remote high mountain village in the Alps sometime around the early 1800's. They ride horses, live in cabins and carry guns and wear hats. Thereby, you could say this is a ""Western"" even if it doesn't take place in the U.S. But for heaven's sake don't let that stop you from watching this fine film.

The film is tightly wound like a spring from the first images.  What the heck is happening? Why is it happening? We may not be sure right away, but then we can assume that we have moved forward several years as a mysterious stranger/loner rides into the high Alps village and is not made to feel welcome. (If you don't immediately get a sense that this could be a Clint Eastwood western such as High Plains Drifter, then you don't know your films).

I'm not going to say much about the plot, because to do so would give too much away. The plot is essentially REVENGE - that's enough for you to know.

The acting is top notch and even if your German isn't good (or non-existent) you're going to like this film. The sets, filming, direction - all of it is ""edge of your seat"" stuff. And it all takes place in deep snow.

It takes awhile to figure out what the heck is going  and it you know your Middle Age history it will help.  For me the gunfight was brutal and gory.

6758255,4,B00OOLIX7S,"THE DARK VALLEY (DAS FINSTERE TAL) was recommended to me by a member of my current silent film class and was well worth the recommendation. He even provided the DVD which came to him courtesy of The Film Movement movie-of-the-month club. There have been German Westerns before (TREASURE OF THE SILVER LAKE, OLD SHATTERHAND) and the author Karl May (the German Zane Grey) was once very popular in his native country. So the seeds for making a great Western were already sown and that is exactly what director Andreas Prochaska has produced. He has successfully borrowed themes from at least four other films (THE WAR LORD, PALE RIDER, DEATH HUNT, THE LAST VALLEY) and skillfully utilized them in this brooding, breathtakingly photographed (in the Italian Alps) story of a stranger in the mid 19th century who comes to an isolated Austrian mountain village ostensibly to make daguerreotypes of the valley and villagers who live there but who has actually come to avenge a wrong from the past and end an abominable practice.

The movie is more concerned with primal themes and their consequences than with being a traditional action piece like the Spaghetti Westerns of 50 years ago. Think of Clint Eastwood in PALE RIDER rather than A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. The Alpine village setting helps to give the story an added dimension making the movie resemble the Mountain genre of films made in Germany in the 1920s. British actor Sam Reilly, just before he made MALEFICENT for Disney, is a remarkable presence. Like Eastwood, he's a man of few words but speaks volumes with his eyes. He's not a very good fighter but is able to do what he has to do. Incidentally, though British, Riley lives with his German wife in Berlin and isn't dubbed. This brings us to the American version which is dubbed and should be avoided. The Film Movement DVD comes with the original German soundtrack and subtitles as well as the dubbed version. Use the former and avoid the latter. At 114 minutes THE DARK VALLEY is a little too long but other than that it's a remarkable little film that stays with you.",1422489600,9,2078,4.772222222222222

6758259,4,B00OOLIX7S,"Sam Riley (yes, you just saw him in Maleficent) stars as Greider, a mysterious American man who rides into an isolated mountain village in Austria. He says he's there to take photographs, but of course there's another reason. The dominant family who seem to run the village also have their own secrets and reasons for wanting him gone.

The Dark Valley is a classic Western with revenge as the impetus. The Dark Valley is based on the book of the same name by Thomas Willmann.

Sam Riley has perfected the sneer, the hundred yard stare and glare, the few words and decisive actions that cement the genre label attached to the film. (One or two scenes may have been a little over the top, but he channeled early Clint Eastwood very well) The supporting players were well cast and suitably menacing or subservient as the case may be.

The scenery was absolutely breathtaking the village, homes and costumes were very well done and absolutely believable.

What affected my rating a bit was the dubbing. It wasn't overly well done and I find the voices used never seem to match the voice the actor really has or that I expect. And it's difficult to match the pacing.  I should have switched back to the original German with subtitles earlier. Although, there wasn't a lot of dialogue - much of the film is action based (v. well done)

But that minor flaw aside, The Dark Valley was an excellent film - I quite enjoyed it.

6758261,4,B00OOLIX7S,"...staged in the mountains of Austria.

""The Dark Valley"" applies familiar Western genre themes to an unusual location: a remote mountain village in Austria. A lone and unknown rider arrives at the start of winter to a village that is under the dominant control of an unlikeable man named Brenner and his even more unlikeable adult sons.

The stranger's claimed interest in mountain photography is a pretext for a different agenda, focused on bringing both revenge on the Brenner clan, and a modicum of relief for the villagers. The ""why"" of this agenda is the major plot surprise of the story.

If you've ever enjoyed a Spaghetti Western, you'll be able to enjoy enjoy the conceit of western movie tropes set in alpine Austria . The dialog is sparse and the pacing is deliberate, but director Andreas Prochaska uses these effectively to create a novel movie experience.

Do yourself a favor, and take the DVD's option to watch in German with English subtitles; the English dubbing (the default for this DVD) isn't especially skillful.

Overall, better than the average offering from the Hollywood formula machine (which sadly ignores the Western these days...)

It appears the small village is run by a group of no-good thugs and bullies. Then one day a lonesome stranger arrives, wanting to stay the winter so as to photograph the beautiful valley. This is not to the liking of the group of thugs. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

I have a couple of comments both as to the movie itself and as to the release of this. As to the movie, this is an excellent western, the likes of which we don't see much around anymore these days. The movie is dark and stylish (check out the scene where the villagers cut down trees for wood at the beginning of winter, just beautiful). The lead performance is courtesy of UK actor Sam Reilly, who previously has appeared as the lead in the Ian Curtis bio-pic ""Control"" and just last year was in the Jack Kerouac biopic ""On The Road"". Reilly is once again excellent, and in great command of German, by the way. Speaking of which: the DVD started with the English dubbed version. Something felt vey off and wrong, and after about 5 min. I figured out the DVD has both the original German version and the English dubbed version. I immediately switched to the original version. Bottom line: great movie, definitely worth checking out (in the original version).

As to the release itself: this was the recent December release of Film Movement's DVD-of-the-Month Club. Imagine my disdain when I found out that this already has been available as an Amazon Instant Video for over a month. So much for Film Movement's ""exclusive"" offerings of foreign and indie movies (and it's not the first time that this has happened). Very disappointing, and even though I'm a longtime subscriber of Film Movement, I will think long and hard before renewing my annual membership in 2015.

Voice is linked to the meaning, when it is disembodied, none of it rings true. You just can't get beyond the studio sound room.  Still would love to see it in the original German.  Anyway, I just don't get the point of dubbing a movie. If you have gone to the bother of going online to order a movie from overseas,  chances are, you can read.",1419552000,6,462,4.287356321839081
6758266,3,B00OOLIX7S,"Interesting movie, not one you'd want to watch twice, and it is tough
to get through it the first time because it is slow and one the surface
not really relevant to today.

I did get some thoughts out of it I would not normally consider, so it
is not a waste to watch.

The scenery and cinematography is good.  There are just not
really characters I could relate to or get involved with, it was kind
of a watch what these people do in their situation and I felt removed
from it mostly.

3/5 - Finished it, did not really like it, but was positive towards it.",1419292800,,558,4.138888888888889
6758267,4,B00OOLIX7S,"This is a ""western"" that takes place in the Alps. In the opening scene we see a woman being taken and a man being killed in an unknown village. Later a young American man, who can speak German, rides into a logging village located just below the tree line. He is an unwelcome stranger who simply wants to takes photos. He pays a healthy sum for lodging. He has a picture with him of his mother. His father died while he was young.

Pretty soon you start to piece together events, even before they are explained...i.e. it is not that difficult from the clues. Even though we may have figured out the mystery, the film still interests us because our stranger (Sam Riley) does not appear to be much of a fighter and is out gunned and out manned.  Good film for those who like a western, or toned down action film.

No adult language, sex, or nudity.",1419206400,10,846,4.341772151898734
6758268,5,B00OOLIX7S,"Greider rides into a mountain village along a path known to few. Once he gets there he asks for shelter for the winter. He is first met with open hostility, and then when they see the colour of his coin he is taken in and sent to stay with Luzi and her mother. He presents himself as a photographer - they say he has a mirror with a memory, and he sits back to wait for the first snow fall of the long winter ahead.

The village is run by an elderman called Old Brenner and his six sons of varying degrees of dysfunctionality. Greider does have a past and that is tied up with the strange goings on in the mountain hide away. As the winter takes hold, so he slowly reveals why he has come to be amongst them.

This is a revenge film in the classic sense of `Pale Rider' et al, and that is not a plot spoiler. It is beautifully filmed, with some breath taking shots and captivating use of light and shade. There is a brooding sense of menace throughout and a pace that keeps things moving whilst still dallying enough to allow the right amount of anticipation to build. Filmed in Italy and presented in German (Tyrolean accent though) and on the Film Movement disc it also has the option of an English dubbed version - which has the lip synch issues that I cant abide. This is one of those films where I found myself shouting advice at the screen - I got that involved in it.

Sam Reilly (`On the road' and `Control') turns in an above solid performance as Greider and all the cast are believable. This has been nominated as Austria's entry for the Academy Awards of 2015 and I wish it all the best as it is truly an excellent film that proves the western still has a place in modern cinema.",1419206400,,1690,4.209876543209877
6758269,4,B00OOLIX7S,"Das finstere Tal (The Dark Valley) is an old Western film set in the Alps and with an Austrian cast except of the lead character, the British actor Sam Riley.

Through a hidden path a lone rider reaches a little town high up in the Alpes. Nobody knows where the stranger comes from, nor what he wants there. But everyone knows that they don't want him to stay. Directed by Andreas Prochaska who also co wrote the script this is a German language version of the old Spaghetti westerns so popular some decades back. As such it is a mood piece (gorgeous cinematography by Thomas W. Kiennast and a stunning musical score by Matthias Weber) that appears to be Prochaska's salute to the old Hollywood westerns.

There is not much story: Through a hidden path a lone rider reaches a little town high up in the Alpes. Nobody knows where the stranger comes from, nor what he wants there. But everyone knows that they don't want him to stay. Sam Riley controls every minute he is on screen and is likely one the reasons the film is beginning to win awards at festivals. A tasty throwback to the grit of the really fine westerns of the past and a welcome one at that. Grady Harp, December 14",1419033600,2,1180,4.433179723502304

The Dark Valley is the perfect Western, equal part Gunslinger Shoot'em Up, Samurai Film, and Psychological Thriller. And it delivers high drama, with supporting cast performances that truly make it an ensemble piece. The German setting and mountain ice makes it all the more uncanny.

This is the original film contribution reframing and contributing to the development of a genre (Western) Tarantino dreamnt of creating, while only capable of Xeroxing tropes and cut-&-pasting aesthetically pleasing shots frame for frame in 'meta-narrative genre subverting callbacks' as seen in things like DJANGO (and probably 'references' in HATEFUL 8.)
