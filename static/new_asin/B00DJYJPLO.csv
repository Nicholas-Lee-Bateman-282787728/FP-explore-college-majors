5819681,5,B00DJYJPLO,"In 1996, Before Sunrise debuted to critical acclaim from viewers and critics.  The story is a spontaneous love story about a man and woman that meet on a train traveling to Vienna.  Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) depart the train together and spend their evening conversing in a variety of different locations within the city and eventually fall head over heels for each other.  However, Jesse is on his way back to the U.S. while Celine lives in Paris, making their relationship impossible.  In the end, they part ways without exchanging information, but promising to meet each other 6 months later.  The story ends without giving viewers an answer on whether they actually met for their plan rendezvous.

The sequel, Before Sunrise, was released in 2004 and picks up nine years.  Jesse has just written a bestselling novel based on the events of the evening between himself and Celine.  He has traveled to Paris on a book tour, only to be visited by Celine at his book signing.  Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Jesse did show up six months after their evening together, but Celine was unable to attend due to the death of her grandmother.  Jesse and Celine spend the sequel catching up and reconnecting with one anther - revealing that Jesse is unhappily married and now has a son, while Celine is working for an environmental organization.  Once again, they spend their constrained time together (Jesse has to catch a flight back to the U.S.) talking about their lives and about what could have been.  In the end, the two realize they have a second chance with one another - and the film ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, presuming Jesse misses his flight to stay with Celine.

Nine years after Jesse decides to miss his plane, Before Midnight picks up with Jesse and Celine together in a relationship, on vacation in Greece with their twin daughters.  Jesse is now divorced and separated from his son Hank who now lives in Chicago with his mother.  While they do still care for one another, Jesse and Celine's priorities have changed - Celine is now focused on her career, while Jesse (now the author of several novels) is focused on strengthening his relationship with his son.  They have now become the couple they always claimed they would fight to become - a couple that spends the majority of their time together resenting one another and arguing.

Once again, Richard Linklater helms the directing chair as he, along with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, collaborate on this possible final chapter in the lives of Jesse and Celine.  Taking place loosely in real-time, the couple is much different than the last time these characters were on the big screen.  While Before Sunrise and Before Sunset were films about falling in love and rediscovering love, Before Midnight is very much a film about two people trying to figure out whether or not they are still in love.  Do they still have a future together or has their relationship run its course?  That's the question these characters contemplate for the entirety of this film.

Like the previous films, the interaction between Hawke and Delpy is perfectly rounded and in depth as they easily feed off one another with each passing scene, un-layering each dimension of their personal lives.  The film is a filled with strong, relentless conversation (as usual) as the gaps are filled in for this second nine year gap  - in which it is revealed that the couple moved to the U.S. for a few years while Jesse wrote his novels and then back to Europe.  Jesse's second novel is based on the story of how they reconnected in Before Sunset.  However, as Jesse has made new writing friends and spent his time traveling the world for book signings, these characters have clearly lost faith in one another - both accusing each other of being unfaithful (and no, they never got married).

Before Midnight is cut into several chapters, discussing a variety of subjects, which includes a film-long discussion about Jesse's desire to move to Chicago and the impact it would have on his relationship with Celine.  Unlike the previous films, several new characters are introduced and explored - Jesse's writing friends and their spouses.  Quite a bit of time is focused on the varying opinions from these new characters on the subjects of sex and relationships.  Make no mistake, love is still the underlying theme of this film - but it is also about evolution between two characters that found each other, found each other again, and decided to make a life for themselves despite the roadblocks.  Before Midnight is not a film about two people making spontaneous decisions as it predecessors.  These characters have matured and carefully dissect one another with each passing word and action, both looking to reclaim the happiness that was once in their hands but has faded with time.

Overall, Before Midnight is simply the next chapter in a beautiful saga based around two individuals that met on a train.  The acting is as pleasant as ever and enjoyable to the very end.  It would appear the saga of Jesse and Celine is complete, however, that doesn't necessarily mean there won't be another chapter.  With undeveloped relationships to explore with their children, it's easily to imagine the next film(s) exploring the parents/ children dynamic.  And, I don't think you'll find a single person complaining if another film is made - but sooner than nine years would be great.  Regardless, this romance saga will go down in film history as one of the greatest love stories ever told.

And I don't tend to watch chick flicks- well, this isn't a chick flick at all.

5819683,5,B00DJYJPLO,"A couple meets on a train and spends a life-changing night in Vienna. They part ways. Nine years later, they meet again in Paris, where they reconnect and wonder what life would be like if they hadn't gone on their own paths. And now, nine more years have gone by as we meet them again, married with children.

In most movies, this would be the definition of `happily ever after'. Sure, 'Before Midnight' could easily have turned into a soapy tearjerker in the wrong hands, but under the helm of Linklater, Delpy and Hawke, it turns into something that is rarely witnessed in cinema: A movie that has love at its very core, but at the same time, is almost anti-romantic. At the very least, it challenges most people's notion of what 'romantic' is.

This couple is real and their issues are real. Their staying together for a decade and having had kids has taken a toll on them. The movie, unlike `Before Sunrise' or `Sunset', is no longer about a random encounter in a beautiful European city. It is about sharing a life together, and the difficulty to accept people for what they really are. It is about intimacy (or lack thereof), guilt and things left unsaid. It is about a love that does not do ""happily ever after"". It is about ""and now, what?""

And precisely because of that, it is human. Its humanity lies in reflecting the flaws and the heartbreak that is so close to anyone who's ever had a fully committed relationship permeated by love. And coming to terms with how each single person relates to this overpowering force of nature is one of the biggest challenges a couple can face. With `Midnight', these immense characters, that almost carry a larger-than-life weight on their shoulders, have reached a brand new level of depth that makes this entry, perhaps, the best in the series.

At the end of the film, I heard a woman whisper to her male companion, ""but where is the love?"". Well, I definitely saw love - rough and complex and beautiful. I did feel like handing her a copy of ""A walk to remember"", though. If you're looking for a fairy tale, you are in for a perfect disappointment.  But if you are looking for an immensely enriching walk that is both exhilarating and heart-breaking, look no further. Meet, once again, Jesse and Celine.",1378684800,47,2256,4.601990049751244

5819685,5,B00DJYJPLO,"I'm new to the whole `Before...' trilogy.  I understand that I'm probably the one in a million who hadn't seen any of the parts, but it is a truth I can't hide from.  Back in 2004, when the internet was abuzz of talk over `Before Sunset' and critics were raving Julie Delpy's performance and the Oscars were nominating its screenplay I was under a rock.  Well, to be completely honest, I wasn't under a rock as much as I was too lazy to want to watch `Before Sunrise' and there was no way I was going to watch a sequel without watching the first film.  So this year I finally buckled.  With all the critical praise for `Before Midnight' I knew that I was going to eventually HAVE to see this movie, and so I Netflix'd `Before Sunrise' and `Before Sunset' and had myself a `Before...' marathon.  Yes, I got up early this morning and watched the first two films and then got in my car and sat in a theater and indulged in the conclusion to this romantic trifecta (or is it?).

In all honesty, I'm still semi-processing the whole thing, but I really don't think one can talk about one film, especially `Before Midnight', without at least addressing the others.  The films are so interconnected despite being about so many varying themes and subjects.  Quite honestly, other than the two main characters these films don't really speak the same language and yet they feel so interconnected.

What I think is so great about this series is that, experienced as I did today (back to back to back), the films play out like a complete relationship.  You have the initial meeting in 1994 on a train through Europe.  These two people, Jesse and Celine, meet rather spontaneously, share a meaningful `chat' and then decide to spend an entire day and night roaming Vienna and getting to know one another.  Then you have their chance `re-encounter' ten years later in 2004.  Much like the infamous `Love Story' (better known by its 1957 remake,  `An Affair to Remember') one of these lovers missed their six month rendezvous, which caused them to be separated for ten years before they are reunited when Jesse is on a book tour through Europe and happens to stop over in France, where Celine is from.  In the latest film you have this pair, now nine years into a serious relationship complete with twin girls and Jesse's son from his previous relationship.  The glowing romance is stripped away and the reality of love and life has set in.  In the beautiful way in which Linklater and company have shot these films, we get to see these snapshots of a relationship in such a full and complete way, and while separately some work stronger than others, together they create a beautiful whole.

They take you from fairytale love affair to realistic adventure to tragic reality, all parts of which contrast and complement in ways unexpected.

I don't know if this speaks to the cynic in me, but I feel as though `Before Midnight' truly stands out as the most impressive of the trilogy.  It felt the most honest and earthy, and while `Before Sunset' certainly felt more organic and natural, there is something emotionally stirring about `Before Midnight' that I just can't shake.  It is the only film in the trilogy that reduced me to tears (several times) and since I'm one who reacts more favorably to having my emotions played with, it is only natural that this conclusion be the film I appreciate the most.

More so than any of the others, `Before Midnight' feels very mature.  With `Before Sunrise' it felt like an indie variation of the classic romantic comedy.  It used big words and long sentences and political, sexual and controversial subtext to set it apart and make it `relevant' and yet recycled clichd themes and situations in order to remain part of that world.  It felt very fairytale like, which is something I enjoyed and yet also felt somewhat disconnected to.  `Before Sunset' moved us forward somewhat with a more honest interpretation of this kindled love, and taking these characters from the initial meeting to only their second time together (yet with so much extra worldly baggage on their shoulders) it made their connection feel more secure, more rooted and honest.  Their verbal exchanges, while equally as long, diverse and weighted, felt easier to digest and felt more comfortable on their tongues.  They were older, wiser and more trustworthy.  But, with this third outing, Linklater takes us out of the fairytale and into the real world.  He draws from a darker place and gives us a real look at a fractured relationship and plays to the idea that NO relationship is free from complication.  Whereas the first two films romanticized the whole experience (even the disagreements were charming), `Before Midnight' confronts us with a more savage underlining of subtext.

I was not expecting this at all, but it was a welcome surprise.

Some may baulk at this assessment, but for me this was Linkater at his most Bergmanesque.  It was reminiscent of what Woody Allen attempted to do with films like `Husbands and Wives' or `Interiors' and yet this actually feels more connected to Bergman's world than either or those films.  I kept calling to mind `Scenes from a Marriage', which is one of my favorite films of all time.  The conversational quality of the whole exercise is so enthralling; one can't help but be completely swept up in it all.  What makes this film so efficient and so affecting is that is couples the same ease of language and chemistry that was honed and perfected over the course of the series and adds that needed edge of tension that makes this film feel more enlightened, more important.

Both Jesse and Celine are flawed individuals.  Unlike Allen's `Husbands and Wives', this never felt like a one-sided conversation.  Even moments where it could be perceived as such (especially when Celine becomes overly agitated and defensive) are diffused by the nature of the film.  This is a mere conversation; a heated one, but a conversation and so the natural recoil of affection and plunge in defensiveness is expected.  The way these two circle the subject of their relationship is so effortless.

Yes, if one were to try and point a finger than the dinner table scene which featured a scenario straight out of `Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married' felt a tad forced and obvious and could have been stripped from the film itself, and yet it all felt so natural given the moment in the film.  It felt like part of a whole, but still I was glad to see it end.

This trilogy works best when its sole focus in on the two leads.  They play off of one another so beautifully that one can't stop looking at them.  While I was initially put off by Hawke in the first film, he completely won me over in `Before Sunset', and while he is extremely effective in `Before Midnight', it is Julie Delpy who completely owns this particular film.  Her progression of character and ease of performance are a rarity in cinema and something to marvel over.

So, as a whole I must say that I really like this trilogy.  I don't love it, although these are films that I really MUST watch again and I have a feeling that over time I'll become more and more effected by them as separate entities (since right now I'm having a hard time viewing them on their own and not as part of a larger whole), and then again they are films that I could easily begin to pick apart and criticize.  I think that the singular nature of the film itself lends itself to that kind of reaction.  By confining your focus to singular conversations, you are leaving yourself open to varying opinions on those conversations and viewpoints and thus you are going to stir passion, either for or against your film.  I could listen to these films all day long, and in fact I'm almost tempted to keep `Before Sunrise' and `Before Sunset' on loop while I'm at work this week just to soak in every word.

As a whole, I'd rate this trilogy an A-, mostly on the strength of the final chapter.  Individually (and this fluctuates by the minute), I'd give `Before Sunrise' a B-, `Before Sunset' a B+ and `Before Midnight' an A, verging on an A+, but I'm hesitant to call this a masterpiece just yet.",1378339200,46,8167,4.649025069637883
5819686,5,B00DJYJPLO,"This is a theatrical review.

This beautifully crafted film follows the earlier ""Before Sunrise"" (1995) and ""Before Sunset"" (2004) and like the second film in the series, 9 years have passed.  After a brief marriage and one child, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) has married Celine (Julie Delpy), the original lovers who met briefly nearly 2 decades earlier.  They have twin girls about 6 and are vacationing in Greece, houseguests of a well-known writer.

Jesse's earlier book about his brief romance with Celine has made him famous.  They now live in Paris which is problematic for Jesse because he rarely sees his teenage son who lives in America.  One of the persistently enjoyable aspects of this film and its predecessors is the wonderful writing.  As usual, the film is written by director Richard Linklater, Delpy and Hawke.  And as usual it all flows so naturally, you feel as if you are eavesdropping.

Now married, we feel the couple maneuver through numerous landmines including career paths, domicile, child rearing, and finances as most couples do.  There are some uncomfortable moments to be sure, for the actors and the audience.  In one scene, they have an argument just before making love.  As the argument escalates, it continues for several minutes standing up, all while Celine remains bare chested.  This film is so well directed, written and acted it is hard to find fault, so I won't.  I don't know if this is the end of Jesse and Celine on film but I hope I'm around in 9 year to find out.",1378339200,7,1502,4.793774319066148
5819687,5,B00DJYJPLO,"Before Midnight...I went into that theater hopeful and expectant and happy to hear more about Celine and Jesse's life together and I walked out feeling conflicted. Primarily due to the explosive climactic scene in the hotel, I was completely stunned by the movie. It took a second viewing to hear some of the dialogue, digest the meaning of snippets of the conversation, and I suspect, much like I did when I was younger and not the ages of the characters at the time, I will only truly understand this chapter in their lives when I'm married. I'm barely 30 and it's nowhere in my mind. I won't spoil anything for anyone, but suffice to say, it will take several viewings to grasp everything.

SIDE NOTE: DEAR LORD, RE-RELEASE BEFORE SUNRISE AND BEFORE SUNSET ON BLU-RAY. I'll gladly pay for the format.  I've already pre-ordered Before Midnight.",1378166400,3,846,4.787671232876712
5819688,5,B00DJYJPLO,"When we last saw Jessie and Celine now already nine years ago, Jessie looked as if he was about to miss his flight back to the US and instead choosing to stay with Celine in Paris. And now we get the third installment of this fanastic mini-franchise.

As ""Before Midnight"" (2013 release; 109 min.) opens, we see Jessie (played by Ethan Hawke) dropping off his 13 yr. old son Hank at the Kalamata airport in the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece. From their conversation we learn that Hank spent the summer with Jessie and Celine on vacation in Greece. As Jessie gets to his car to drive off, we see Celine (played by Julie Delpy) and... their 7 yr. old twin daughters Ella and Nina! So yes indeed, Celine and Jessie became a couple, living in Paris, and now the parents of 2 girls. The remainder of the movie plays out that rest of the afternoon and evening, and to tell you much more of the 'plot' would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is another tour-de-force for director Richard Linklater and co-stars/co-writers Hawke and Delpy. The strenght of the movie is in its story-telling and character development. Keep in mind, there are really only 4 scenes in the movie: the drop-off and drive back from the airport, the evening dinner, the walk to the hotel, and the hotel room, that's it. Second, the two main characters' development is going into opposite directions: Jessie was not all that likeable in the first movie (for me anyway) but Celine was just darling. In the second movie, it was pretty much even keel. In ""Before Midnight"", Jessie has become the likeable character by far, whereas Celine comes across as resentful, bitter at times, and not very likeable far too often. At one point, in the middle of a heated argument, Celine hisses at Jessie ""you're no Henry Miller at any level!"", revealing an ugly side of Celine that we had never seen before. As we see these characters getting older, it's now also clear that they are struggling with guilt and remorse, and insecurity over their parenting skills as well.

Bottom line: ""Before Midnight"" is a fantastic conversation-driven movie, inviting you to observe what's become (and still becoming) of Jessie and Celine, both as persons and as a couple. Here's hoping that we can give rendez-vous in 2022 for the next installment in the ""Before"" franchise. Meanwhile, ""Before Midnight"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1377734400,67,2482,4.807962529274005
5819689,5,B00DJYJPLO,"Let's first get two things out of the way.  If you've seen BEFORE SUNRISE and/or BEFORE SUNSET and disliked them...there is no reason to give BEFORE MIDNIGHT a try.  And if you haven't seen those movies at all, I HIGHLY recommend you do prior to checking out Richard Linklater's latest near classic.

I should also warn that even the most cursory mention of plot points in either the 2ndor the 3rdmovie can be construed as spoilers...but it's tough to talk about the 3rdfilm without giving away some surprise.  I'll balance as best I can.

In BEFORE SUNRISE, young American Jesse (Ethan Hawke), age about 23 meets young Frenchwoman Celine (Julie Delpy), age about 23.  They are on a train bound for Vienna.  Jesse is flying back to the US from Vienna the morning after the train arrives.  Celine is on her way back to Paris after visiting family in Budapest.  They strike up a conversation and clearly hit it off right away.  Jesse asks Celine to get off the train with him and spend the night wandering Vienna before he has to leave Europe.  The movie follows their ambling through Vienna and just lets them talk.  And talk.  And talk.  And fall in love.  For the right viewer, this was a nearly magical film that beautiful captured, through long, semi-improvised takes, the joy of two people getting to know each other and come to appreciate and even love each other.  We felt like we were right there with them, and the two stars gave terrific performances.  At the end, they agree they will meet again in 6 months, and we're left to wonder what happened to them.

BEFORE SUNSET tells us (spoilers coming up).  It's nine years later, and Jesse is in Paris speaking about his new book, which is clearly a retelling of that night in Vienna.  Celine seeks him out and we quickly discover they did NOT meet (I won't spoil why).  Jesse has just an hour before he needs to leave for the airport, and he and Celine pick up their easy conversation and share about their lives, including the regrets and unhappinesses they've had.  It's clear they are meant to be together...their affection blooms almost immediately.  New to the equation are some minor quarrels (why didn't you come?  If only you hadn't..., etc.).  But in the end, Jesse is deciding to miss his flight so he can delight in being in Celine's apartment, drinking tea, listening to her sing.  The final scene of the movie is one of heartbreaking simplicity and yet such complex emotion.

Now, another 9 years later, the two are each around 41 years old.  SPOILERS AHEAD.  They have been together since that time in Paris.  They've had a sometimes rocky road, and this movie is more talking...this time in lovely Greece.  They have kids.  They aren't ""new"" to each other anymore as they were in the first 2 films.  They are now capable of getting on each other's nerves.  They haven't always just made each other happy.  And near the end of the film, they engage in what I can only describe as the most brutal husband and wife argument since George and Martha got into it in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF.  There's no violence, but it's a rough scene.  Raw and searing.  Funny.  Truthful.  Utterly gripping.

In real life, were I to spend much time with either of these two...I think I'd seriously dislike them.  They are self-centered, pretentiously ""artsy"" and VERY vocal.  I don't think I'd want to sit and listen to them talk all day.  But this is a film, and Linklater and his stars (who have co-writing credit) can take us to just the right moments.  The conversations (and snatches of conversation) that tell us all we need to know about the last nine years.  It's an amazing film.  It's illuminating and full of so many truths.  They may not always be truths I can personally relate to...but they feel true and possible and real.  After the film, you talk about Jesse and Celine as though they were real people.  More than just about any other movie ever, I think.  Their dialogue is so specific and so revealing.  Yes, these folks are more articulate than any ""real"" people...but we don't really want to see normal, sloppy conversation.  It's enjoyable to spend some time with these folks (although, again, I wouldn't like them in ""real life"") because they react to each other so believably.  Their words mirror their actions and their expressions.  Delpy and Hawke (who I'm not normally a huge fan of) have chemistry that's astonishing...you really feel you're peeking in on something you aren't meant to see and hear.

All three films include gorgeous scenery, and BEFORE MIDNIGHT is the most gorgeous of all.  The Greek countryside and seaside is lovely, and Linklater just lets his camera take it in casually.  Jesse & Celine comment on it sometimes, but mostly it just flows over us.  And the film is mostly a series of very long takes (the scene near the opening when they are driving from the airport back to the house they're staying at is at least 15 minutes long, and seen entirely through a front windshield...but it NEVER feels static).  These films are made with such deceptive simplicity.

I acknowledge that these films could also be insufferable to watch.  My wife and I rewatched the first two just before going to this latest release, and BEFORE SUNRISE feels a smidge pretentious now. I think that has more to do with the fact that I'm also 18 years older.  I have less patience for the naivet&eacute; of ""young love"" than I used to.  But that also brought home to me that a perfectly legitimate reaction to these films could be boredom or loathing of the characters.  But I consider myself lucky to be swept away by all three films...and in my opinion, BEFORE MIDNIGHT is best of the bunch.  It's gorgeous to look at.  It's richer in themes and content.  It features the biggest acting challenges and the most blistering dialogue.  It's hopeful (as all the films are), but the hope is the hardest fought and hardest won here.  I highly recommend all three films for ADULT viewers...not just because they contain some profane language, but because I can't imagine a child or teen really understanding what these two are blathering on about (or caring).  But if you're adult and you've been in love (or are in love) and have any inkling of the complications of being an adult in our world...this film should resonate resoundingly.",1377216000,301,6316,4.6730245231607626

Neither Delpy nor hawke is a particularly sophisticated actor, and the combination with this very prosaic script left me uninspired.  I liked the previous two movies a bit better, because I was always interested to see where the story went. But this movie is essentially a 90 minute slowly-building argument which depends a good deal upon the female character acting like a neurotic crybaby, and the husband doing that typical ""let's be rational"" thing men do which is so superior. During the overlong hotel room argument scene, I finally gave up and turned it off. Not only do I wonder whether most 40-year-olds with twin daughters have the energy to have such a sustained and stupid argument, I don't care. And that's the problem with this movie;  I don't really care whether they break up or not, or whether they move to the states or not, because Linklater and the actors didn't make me care. If you loved the first two films, I think it might be worth watching. But if you're sick of listening to people argue about nothing, I'd skip it.",1506816000,,1208,4.683962264150943

The writing is bright, literate, so true to life that you might even admit to one or more of the behaviors exhibited, but like with guests who've stayed too long, I was ready for them to leave. Or maybe I'm the guest who needed to go. Their love is intact, their conflict not out of the ordinary, in light of life's many large and small stressors and pressures. She tends to overread and overreact to his comments, while he oversimplifies and trivializes what is serious for her-- all  realistic and credible. I would say 3 is enough, but if they're both around as seniors, it might be interesting to see that life stage represented. But my descendants will have to check that one out.

The balance between them was completely lost in this movie. Celine turns into a completely irrational lunatic and Jesse becomes some sort of martyr for the relationship. I know they were going for ""real love is hard"", but they took it too far. It was like they wanted to illustrate just how far as couple can take their emotional abuse of one another and survive in spite of it. I thought the hotel scene was just too extreme. I get that real long lasting love is hard, and there arguments and bumps in the road, but this was unnecessarily harsh. Even though the end was supposed to portray the message ""love is hard work, but it conquers all"", it left me feeling like  they'd have both been much happier if it hadn't. Very disappointing after how much I loved the first two movies. Again, I completely get they were trying to show the reality of long term relationships rather they are typical romance movie fairy tail ending, but this was just too much.",1484179200,2,1105,4.443349753694581

5819715,5,B00DJYJPLO,"The following review was originally written on May 30th, 2013. Since then, Richard Linklater has made Boyhood, and I'm more and more convinced that he's one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation:

""Im of two minds on Ethan Hawke. I love the films hes made with Richard Linklater (all the Before movies, the overlooked Tape), but when hes not working with him, as in the overrated Training Day and Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead, I often find his acting mediocre. Here, however, he and the ever-excellent Julie Delphy are sensationalboth as performers and as co-writers.

Nine years is a very long time to wait between these films, especially considering that 2004s Before Sunset, while excellent, was a mere 80 minutes. This film, the longest in the series at 109 minutes, is a feast in every sense of the word: from start to finish, I was enthralled, and when the final scene passed and the screen went black, I was hopingpraying, reallythat the film wouldnt end.

But end it did and wait I must. These are beautiful films, a kind of Brief Encounter for the MTV generation (or now, the Twitter generation), and absence does tend to make the heart grow fonder. The first two films are brilliant, and in this third installment, not a shred of brilliance has been lost. As the greatest, most mature, and most searching film of Linklater's ambitious, Before Midnight is an absolute gem.

Jesse and C&eacute;line are both romantic people, but they are also deeply pragmatic. They accept that reality can (frustratingly) get in the way of our most idealistic instincts. The three films, collectively taken, seem to comment on how love means different things to different people at differentbased on gender, based on age, and based on experience. The films accomplish this beautifully and subtly, without a hint of pretension or contrivance.

This is one of those films where nothing happens and everything happens. I will avoid talking at any length about the plot, not just because I want to avoid spoilers, but because the greatness in these films has never lied in their plotting. Theyre not about what happens; they're about how what happens happens. Theyre about how we communicate things we are proud or ashamed of in the context of a long-term relationship.

As the film opens, Jesse takes his son Hank to the airport for a flight back to Chicago to live with his now ex-wife. Jesse is worried about not being a consistent presence in his sons life, and he pressures C&eacute;line into moving closer to Hankwhich is to say, somewhere in America. Jesse and C&eacute;line are living together, married with two kids and vacationing in Greece (gorgeously photographed by Christos Voudouris).

The romance between him and C&eacute;line has evolved into a more complicatedand problematicrelationship. She protests to his proposed move, not just because she likes living in Paris, but because she is having career problems. Her activism is proving to be largely ineffective, and the French government she so adamantly rejected working for in Before Sunset is starting to become a possible employer. She notes that the government has changed, but when Jesse suggests she could do similar work in America, she balks.

A dinner scene with a Greek family introduces something rare for these films: characters other than C&eacute;line and Jesse actively engaging in conversation. The Greek characters have a limited presence in the filmconfined to the first actbut their interests and sensibilities are deeply interesting and the coastal scenery near their house is breathtaking.

The films ending leaves open the possibility of another film. In a summeror even a decadeof big franchises, this is one series that I truly hope has more sequels (it could become a version of Michael Apteds Up series for millenials). I, and many others viewers, would be more than happy to follow Jesse and Celeste until they re-make Amour.""",1483315200,,3922,5.030816640986132

5819747,5,B00DJYJPLO,"I feel like someone should write a book about how this trilogy of films is like a wonderfully astute group therapy about all the things to do, and NOT to do with the one person you really love in this life. This is obviously my very personal reaction, since I feel I have made every single one of the mistakes illustrated here, and have dreamt of making all of the right moves. Watching these films feels very personal, and moving.

It is great how in the second one of the trilogy, before there was even the thought of a trilogy, Julie Delpy is so mercurial and negative, so angry, which sets up the argument scenes in the third film, Before Midnight. That one also shows him egotistic and narcissistic, and her as passionate but disappointed and sad, and how they each quickly dismiss heavy topics and quickly switch to something else. Their characters are so consistent and evolve so believably well in all the films!
Clearly Richard Linklater is a genius, intellectually and productionally, gets things done, and has had the insight to let the characters write their own dialog. This is the only film I know of where that happens so extensively, and would like to know if there are other films written collaboratively like these films are.

Given the number of five star reviews, I am not alone in thinking these films to be EXCELLENT, works of genius that transcend their time. Yes, I am reviewing all three films here, because now that they are all out, they clearly belong together. I think I am going to read many of the other Amazon reviews just to connect with other people who, too have been so moved, or I hope they were moved, since I haven't read any of them yet!!",1471737600,,1678,4.552980132450331

5819759,4,B00DJYJPLO,"The danger in talking films like this is that there is so little else to go on -- action -- that missteps can be huge, and often irrevocable. It has to be 100 percent believable, or else it crashes. And there is a pretty big misstep here, but it's not irrevocable, and the film doesn't crash. And that is to the credit of the writing, acting, and direction.

SPOILER

The misstep for me is the long extended walk to the hotel, after the excellent car and dinner scenes, before the brilliant hotel scene. I think Linklater knew it too, there are cuts there that the rest of the film doesn't have, the dialogue not as engaging, the acting not as convincing.

But the rest is really really good, amazing to me how natural the acting is, how unwritten the script sounds. And there is so much so good about that final scene -- the way almost-sex can so quickly turn into a fight, how Celoine (Delpy) lifts the strap of her dress back on her shoulder to announce -- so much for that. Then Jesse, arguing, puts back on his pants. And in the car, the way Jesse mentioning how he misses his son, how he feels he should be closer to him, and Celine, very astutely, immediately spots this as the beginning of the end of their relationship.

And at the end we are shown just how cruel Celine(/women?) can be, that extra gear men just don't have, not just w the Henry Miller comment, but with the way she is so rude to Jesse when he is trying so hard -- above and beyond, I'd say -- to make things right again, with a very cute letter from Celine at age 80, and then he almost says, you know what, Celine -- the hell with it, the hell with you. That is about as well done as I've ever seen any tiny human detail done in a film. And then the ship, as if being hit by a freak -- but not at all unprecedented -- wave does slowly right itself. There will be more freak waves, and the next one may well sink them, but not this one.

A brave film, well acted by all, but especially by Hawke, I think.",1470096000,,1981,4.1484375

5819764,5,B00DJYJPLO,"[Rounded up from 4-1/2 Stars] Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) aren't your typical Hollywood on-screen couple, and, I feel, writer Richard Linklater wouldn't have it any other way.  That would be my explanation for some of the lesser reviews for this film from the public (though not from movie critics)--that a film with such an authentic-feeling relationship, filled with a plethora of concomitant dialogue, isn't what most viewers are used to; therefore, the tendency of some viewers is to immediately write it off as substandard, as a generalization.  In the Oscar-nominated ""Before Midnight"" (2013), the third movie is the charm for Linklater in this brilliantly written movie series (after 1995's ""Before Sunrise"" and 2004's ""Before Sunset,"" similarly impressive), the most romantic movies ever made, in my opinion, possessing the cinematic novelty of watching the characters grow (at the rate of a sequel every 9 years, in approximately the main characters' 20s, 30s, and 40s in the 3 films, respectively) in some of life's most significant phases.  ""Midnight"" effortlessly and seamlessly transitions from scene to scene as if a drone captured the footage.  The viewer is supplanted to Greece (where the entire film was shot) right along with the characters and, with undivided attention, is intimately immersed in the film's strength:  its filled-to-the-brim dialogue and character development favored over Hollywood's boy-meets-girl character cliches and frenetic-editing sequences (though one gesture by Celine in the chapel was borderline sacrilegious and Celine's topless scene and some of the sex talk were not integral to the plot and probably should've been cut; Hawke didn't even have a topless scene, LOL).  The viewer tours Greece right alongside them, including a countryside drive, stop at the market, walks through its narrow streets, rock stairways, and a Greek chapel.  And, again, being the third movie in the series, perceptive moviegoers know and care about Jesse and Celine, and Linklater successfully fulfills and confirms our ongoing affection for these soulmates so as to very much look forward to the next sequel, presumably due in 2022.",1466208000,,2180,5.431952662721893

Here she is ON VACATION IN GREECE and she decides kind of out of nowhere to fall out of love?  Or she doesn't.  It's unclear.  It's tacky.  It's boring, rambling, and pretentious like the first two films.  And now that Julie's figure fell slap apart (hey- even she referred to herself as an old fat-ass) she decided to start taking her clothes off?  Why couldn't the director have avoided that?  He did in the previous two films.  And the language- it was so crass (because there was no justification for it) that it reminded me of the original Robocop.  It was, again, embarrassing to watch.

For me, all three of these films are treasures, and echo very many experiences of my own life (I'm just about the same age as these two).",1458000000,,611,4.389380530973451

5819848,1,B00DJYJPLO,I've seen the rave reviews about this movie and I must be missing something. I really enjoyed the first two in this trilogy but this film starts with Ethan Hawke coming out looking like a sheepdog complete with the cute little precocious son who has more wisdom than a 60 year old(overdone in ALL plots these days). If you survive that part you are then treated to a long car drive and idiotic conversation between the mom and dad in the front with two sleeping clones in the back seat obviously overcome by their own adorableness. About 15 minutes of this horse manure was all I could take and I ejected Before Midnight and switched to a fabulous B&W classic with Burt Lancaster leading a prison revolt.

There is more tension in this one, and it shows how people often take things for granted when they get what they want. There are also (maybe) glimpses into Linklater's great film ""Boyhood."" I guess many of Linklater's films overlap to some degree, but aside from the actual actors in Before Midnight and Boyhood, there is the tension of love and of being in love, parting, having children, etc. The Before trilogy is a gem and a romantic sleeper, which maybe only Linklater fans will know about and enjoy.

The first two are more focused on the budding romance between Jesse and Celine, whereas this one touches base with the couple well into their relationship. The so called ""honeymoon"" faze as dwindled and you get a more realistic insight into their lives. I love it ! Although they tend to fight much more in this 3rd film, there's something so raw and passionate about their arguments. It's kind of sad to see that they don't have a fairy tale relationship, but that's life, and although you might be with the love your life, it's not going to be all rainbows and flowers.

5819870,5,B00DJYJPLO,"The only reason that I did not watch the Before series by Richard Linklater was the fact that they seemed boring but somehow the movies kept on appearing in my readings and on movie lists of many people. I still haven't watched the two prequels but I will now because I loved this film so very much.
This is a movie about life as it happens after years of marriage, it would help if you have seen the other installments but I enjoyed this as a stand alone. We get to know the lovers ( Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke) as a married couple of many years. Now on holiday in Greece with their two daughters. As the summer nears its end, Hank is sad as he just had to send his son away on to Chicago back to his ex wife. He is worried that he won't be able to be a part of his growing son as he wants and that he will miss out on the most important years.  The conversation in the car as it drives down the countryside to a dinner date is a single long take and it is important that you listen to the seemingly small talk and chatter because a lot of things are revealed about the past lives of the occupants. The single take shots are amazing and are used throughout the movie whether they are in the car, at the dinner table, in the hotel room fighting accusing each other.
I can't even do justice to this film through this brief review because the movie is made up of so many deep layers. The chemistry between Delpy and Hawke is so good that you forget that they are actors. They make you believe that they have actually been married for a long time and realise that friendship, care and trust is so important for a marriage to last. This is a movie that you just have to watch to see what I mean. Release date: 20th January 2013.

""And when I watched ""Before Sunset"" I realized lightning could strike twice in the same place - BOTH were magical movies - full of magical dialogue (at times awkward - but that was what made it so real). Both movies will forever live as my all time favorites...and then this movie came along! Ouch! You lost the magic, you lost the connection, you lost the dialogue! Love can be magical well into your 40's and beyond...and this movie loses that completely!

""Before Sunrise"" - magic in your 20's! A magical night...one of those nights that lasts a thousand years! Thank You!

""Before Sunset"" - magic in your 30's! A Magical night...one of those evenings that lasts a thousand years! Thank You!

""Before Midnight"" - falls on its face! Gets caught up in the drama of ""typical"" American life! Makes the lives of the two main characters boring, simplistic, and down right depressing! Jesse's final victory is so incredibly lame! The TRUTH is magic can live on well into your 40's and 50's and beyond!!!! The opportunity to capture that magic was here and they blew it!

I've watched the previous two movies countless times - again and again! This movie - I watched once and it hurt to watch it. The 2nd and 3rd attempts I couldn't even finish it! Sad!

A tedious dinner scene- you just want to get to the dialogue. That's what made the others so great.

5819994,2,B00DJYJPLO,"The direction and acting of Before Midnight, superb. It maintains the excellence seen in the first two installments on both counts. My relative dislike of the film comes from the connection I no longer feel with the characters. In '95 I was in high school hopped up on hormones and a romantic. Before Sunrise was the dream. In '04 I was a young professional living in Paris in a long distance relationship with my future spouse. Before Sunset I could somewhat relate to. Now I'm married with children. We love each other, we love our kids, we have fights but there's no resentment. We've evolved into better people by learning how to be better at forgiving and sacrificing. *SUBJECTIVE SPOILER* Jessie and especially Celine have seemingly devolved. They haven't grown more generous or forgiving. They've maintained the selfishness of youth. Celine resents having chosen to have children. Jesse resents the inevitable gulf with his child that came with divorce he chose. I fear these characters will never find peace because they both refuse to or are incapable of finding happiness in putting the other's needs completely before their own. Though they shake hands and make up in the tie a ribbon on it ending, I can't help but think that one of the next times Jesse has to say goodbye to Hank at the airport he and Celine have the final chapter of the fight we see in the penultimate act of the film. In 2022 when Before Nautical Twilight comes out, maybe Celine slips Jesse and her kids some Essence of Nightshade and she's finally free of the surprising sacrifices having a family requires one to make. Sequel or not it's fitting that the feature's backdrop is Greece. No happy endings here folks, this relationship ends in tragedy. The characters haven't grown enough to lead me to believe otherwise.",1424304000,,1803,4.819354838709677

It is even a more realistic portrayal of a couple then the first movie.  The teasing, banter, and fighting. The Greek Islands are even more scenic than Paris or Vienna.  Julie Delpy shines in this movie whereas Ethan Hawke's presence seems to dominate the first two movies.  The only knock would be that the dinner scene was a bit too lengthy.

The relationship blossomed and bloomed, in conversation and respect. They got along famously--he certainly mellowed and teased her less by this third film.. Their friends' relationships were trying to fill this void, I feel. I was rooting for it, but...Yes, they refer to the days/times that followed ""that exciting afternoon""!!

5820136,4,B00DJYJPLO,"Though this is the third in a series of widely spaced films (""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"") that documents the early relationship of Jesse and Celine, it is not strictly necessary to see the previous two before enjoying ""Before Midnight"". However, if you do take the time to watch those two films, you will know that this couple fell in love in two brief meetings in which they talked, and talked and talked - baring their hearts and souls to each other in a way that is delightful and entertaining to watch.

Though we don't know it at the end of the second film in the series, the couple marries and has twin daughters soon afterwards. It is now 9 years later, and they are in the final day of a 6-week vacation / writer's workshop (for Jesse) on a Greek Island. Jesse is feeling angst-ridden and depressed at having to put his older son back on a plane to return to his mother in Chicago. Though the couple and their beautiful blonde twin daughters live in Paris, Jesse broaches the subject of whether Celine would consider moving back to Chicago so that they could be closer to his son. The idea doesn't sit well with her, since she is contemplating accepting a new job that's a big career move, and the rest of the day involves one continuous conversation that seems to cover every aspect of their relationship, families, joint history and careers.

There are really just 3 scenes in this movie - the drop off at the airport and long car drive back to their villa, a walk through scenic Greek ruins, and the visit to the hotel room and grounds. There is no real action, and only a few other actors. The whole film is basically dialogue, set in some interesting and scenic places. It sounds boring, but the dialogue is superb - raw, emotional, amusing, gut-wrenching, painful and honest. I've never known any couple who can talk so incessantly about any subject, but the connection between these two actors is so perfect, that you really believe they are Jesse and Celine, and not Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.

The dialogue ranges in so many different directions, that it is impossible to guess whether this couple is headed for trouble or reaching a new level of commitment and connection. It's difficult to even take sides in their argument, because both reveal some negative sides of their personalities. At times, Celine comes across as a shrill martyr, and Jesse as self-absorbed and distant. Might we be seeing another sequel in 10 years when their daughters head off to college and they commence a new era in their relationship? I can't say, because that would be the ultimate plot spoiler.",1411689600,,2608,4.6529284164859

5820142,2,B00DJYJPLO,"Honestly, I don't understand why critics raved about this film, which is a failure in nearly every respect. I loved ""Before Sunrise"" when it came out in 1995, and was astonished at how Richard Linklater and his actors/co-writers managed to make lightning strike twice with ""Before Sunset."" I went so far, in my Amazon.com review nearly 10 years ago, as to call them ""the most perfectly realized romantic films in American movie history, bar none."" So, needless to say, I was greatly looking forward to seeing ""Before Midnight.""

Unfortunately, Linklater's experimentation can on occasion end up being pretentious and annoying, and that's the case here. The film is a tremendous disappointment. I didn't believe the new dynamic between the couple for one moment, and their arguments seemed very forced and endless.

Luckily, Linklater's subsequent movie, ""Boyhood,"" was excellent and a return to form.

By the way, Linklater's best work is reminiscent of Eric Rohmer films in that it relies on real-time effects and lengthy conversations to tap into what it means to be human and connect with others.

5820205,5,B00DJYJPLO,"The trio of Linklater,Delpy and Hawks inject their personal experiences into the creeping demographic trilogy as 40 year olds. 40 is the new 30 but the couple's new adventures revolve around administrating their children. What we get from the first movie is intellect and young romance. The second movie is regret,rediscovery and  second chances. The third movie continues the regret thematic but injects humor,sarcasm. The original movie is vastly more innocent and drives a familiar date crowd to watch it. You have to be a little more sanguine about Hollywood to appreciate this newer film but since the first movie Julie Delpy has become very proficient at writing dialogue and filming. So, the personalities of her comedies are coming in to add a fresh flavor to the series. Ethan Hawks using the line,""You know what? You are the Mayor of Crazy town"" in these long scenes was hysterical. Their arguments are as deep as their previous long conversations but superbly animated and acted.
Delpy hinted at Celine's neurosis and politics in the second movie but she really ramps it up. Ethan Hawks,his dress and visage indicating his overly casualness, really shows his weaknesses as a human being in the role. The end, as usual, is atypical and catches you off guard. Clearly they need to make these films until they flat out die. Its always evolving.",1407369600,,1352,4.982300884955753

5820225,4,B00DJYJPLO,"If you've seen the first two installments (Before Sunrise, Before Sunset) of this intoxicating talk-fest from writer/director, Richard Linklater, you are pretty much obligated by law to see this third one. It's the darkest and most intense of the three, but no less winning and likable.

Co-stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have been credited as co-writers on 'Sunset' and 'Midnight.' It's clear that they know these characters, Jesse and Celine very, very well, giving them tremendous depth, complexity and back-story.  I love the way on each of these two later films how three creators plunge you right into Jesse and Celine's lives, then slowly fill you in on the details of what's transpired in the intervening years since the last installment ended.

Often, this storytelling is done via exceptionally long, word-packed passages in which the characters do nothing more than interact with each other. Most notable: a single extended scene - easily more than 10 minutes in length - in which the two characters walk down a path and chat amiable.

Then, by contrast towards the film's end, there's a devastating scene in which the two converse in a markedly different tone in a hotel room.  I'd been leery of seeing this scene as I'd been warned of its intensity and I have such good feelings towards these characters. Regardless, it's great movie-making...and bold stuff from Delpy, who really gives it everything during these climactic moments, both emotionally and physically. Though still beautiful, she's not afraid here to show us what a natural aging process looks like.",1403481600,,1579,5.104651162790698
5820226,5,B00DJYJPLO,"The title of this review is a little deceptive. Really, my favorite movie is this whole trilogy.

I watched Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight back-to-back-to-back at a local trilogy event this past Valentine's Day weekend.

After watching Before Sunrise, I thought, ""Wow, that was a good movie. I'm glad I watched it.""

After watching Before Sunset, I thought, ""Wow, that was a great movie, and it wasn't until just now that I realized how great Before Sunrise is. It paid serious attention to detail.""

After watching Before Midnight, I thought, ""Wow, okay, that was the best movie I've ever seen, except for Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, which are also completely flawless; I just didn't realize it until now.""

Each movie takes place within a span of 24 hours or less. They each take place nine years apart, and they were each made nine years apart. The lead characters' actors helped write the screenplays for all the movies. All of these things together cause some interesting things happen.

1. The characters age realistically in every way (maturity, appearance, mannerisms, etc.).

2. The characters feel real.

3. The situations feel real. Since the movies each span less than 24 hours, it just feels like a glimpse into some of the most interesting days of these characters' lives.

4. The characters can change. Since each movie occurs nine years apart, you see drastic changes in the characters, but you also get to see how they remain the same. Their attitudes change; in general and towards each other, but the way they handle problems and such doesn't seem to change that much. It's not until the third movie that you realize that all the changes are surface level, and their deepest selves haven't changed at all.",1402531200,2,1750,4.905084745762712

This is not some pseudo-intellectual movie about love and live and existentialism, and it definitely is not pretentious.
There is much more to it.

Before Midnight (2013) is Linklater's continuation of his masterpiece that I strongly believe is still in the process of making.
I would not be surprised at all if ten years from now, he would direct fourth installment of this life-long saga.
It almost seems to be a life-long project of the director and two of his stars (Hawke and Delpy).  Seeing them
age and evolve over the years is feels as if the viewer is watching something real.  It is as if the director records
two ordinary people and their relationship and how it progresses and changes with time.  The dialogue feels natural
and spontaneous, I do not think that there was a movie script written for this film.

Recommended for mature audience only.
Also, if you found the (Before Trilogy) to your liking then I recommend seeing Krzysztof Kieslowski's and Eric Rohmer's filmography.",1402272000,,1095,4.772486772486772
5820230,5,B00DJYJPLO,"If the ""Before"" saga is viewed as a body, Before Sunrise represents the birth and the awkward transition from child to teenager. Before Sunset is the uncertain but hopeful glance the teenager takes into their future, like a freshly graduated highschooler who stands between the past and the future. Before Midnight? The adult years. And parenthood.

Before Midnight is filled with lush scenery, philosophical discussion, and excellent acting. Sound familiar? Yes, this third chapter maintains the high quality of the series and even manages to kick things up a notch. Before Sunset was better than the first film. And Before Midnight tops them all.

Frank, authentic and deeply romantic, this third entry in the saga proves that, like a fine wine, Jesse and Celine simply get better with age. Or at least...become much more interesting to watch. The script is flawless and the performances are fluid. These are real people. The camera is eavesdropping. Kudos to Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy for creating this illusion, as well as Richard Linklater. But, really, this is Julie Delpy's show. She is simply radiant this time around, and deserving of award recognition. To call her performance the best of the year is fair praise.

If this is the final chapter, then my heart is broken. Please, Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, please don't stop. I will wait another 9 years, and then another 9 more, just to see the next chapter. These two characters are a part of my life now. Their story inspires me, along with many others. Don't listen to the negative reviews; your films are priceless and meaningful, and they shimmer in the glut of shallow cinema. I'm looking at you, Transformers 4.

Fans of pure cinema, of art, and of love, take notice: the ""Before"" saga is waiting for you. Jump in.

Before Midnight: 5 out of 5 stars.

Picture quality and audio quality are nearly flawless. On blu-ray, that is. The only problem I could find was a few shots of Celine's dress look overly sharpened. The overall look of the film is made to feel realistic, with natural lighting and zero special effects. The blu-ray looks beautiful. Audio is crisp for a dialogue-driven film. Picture/Audio quality: 4.5 out of 5 stars.

The second film shows the characters as more grounded. They are certainly more mature, but that hardly stops them from aspiring to true love. That is what makes Before Sunset so meaningful. Both characters instinctively knew the other is their counterpart, and they act upon that with sincere appreciation.

The third film is a test of that love. Married couples are better at speaking to this, but even love is not enough to overcome the myriad challenges associated with long-term relationships. It helps that the characters, in particular, Celine, are both quite intelligent and worldly. They have problems. The simplest argument can devolve into a grudge match over one or the other's intentions. But they still recognize how it would be to live without the other. I like to think it is because of this that they are able to reconcile. It is not sufficient to love one another. Each has to understand the price of loss.

5820293,1,B00DJYJPLO,"Wow, what a thoroughly disappointing and depressing conclusion to an otherwise bright trilogy. I was certainly a big fan of the first two movies - they seemed to put the discussion of ideas and concepts at the forefront, ahead of simple emotional dramas. Unfortunately, as Before Midnight opens, we find Jesse and Celine embroiled in a terrible marriage - masquerading as something else. There is clearly no love left - just abuse pretending to be ""love"". Celine is fat, mean, and profoundly attached to playing the victim. She has certainly not cared for herself, and she is incapable of truly caring for anyone else around her. She aggressively attacks Jesse on every front: as a man, as an artist, as a husband, and as a father. Any one of those deeply unkind comments should have been the end of the relationship - sadly it was not. Jesse is forced to do ever more degrading dances to simply get a smile out of Celine, and to keep her engaged. My question became: Why bother? What's the payoff? Nothing but more anger and silly displays of narcissism.

They (as you can tell from many reviews here) bore Americans who have to have bombs, car wrecks, and women shooting guns three times their size to enjoy anything. These films move through attitudes to life and death with a clarity remarkable for our time, and a sense of humor enough to tickle us and draw us along. Humanity is the subject. Delpy and Hawke are great. These are movies, however conversational, to be seen and studied more than once, the language to be thought about again and again. Love in all its forms is the subject.

5820299,3,B00DJYJPLO,"This review assumes that you have seen the 'Before' Films. 1st Spoiler alert: It is not possible to assess 'Before Midnight' without bringing up 'The Fight'. Both of the 'Most Helpful' reviewers make the same false comparison to the legendary Burton/Taylor battles in 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf'. That's not like comparing Apples and Oranges. More like 'Would you like the Greek Salad...or Cannabilism'? Try to imagine Taylor and Burton playing Celine and Jesse. We can't because it's absurd.

After 18 years and over half way through this installment, 'Before...' is still an escapist romance strolling around a gentle coming of age story. What makes 'The Fight' so startling is that it IS at a believable level of vitriol.
It is true to the character's crisis.

2nd Spoiler: 'Before Midnight' has the right tone almost all the way through. But what a most unsatisfying ending. Not the unresolved questions- of course the sequel is all set-up as usual. Rather, there are two stunningly wrong moments. One is Jesse's response to the fight. Maybe he can stay on his feet through Celine's extended barrage. But he takes her final blow: ""I don't love you anymore"", like it was just another jab. They are 9 rounds into a final break-up...but he's FINE. He improvises an incredibly lame and patronizing make-up letter when being patronized is half of her complaint. With that she sighs and just folds?!?

5820300,4,B00DJYJPLO,"Like many other viewers of this series, I was captivated by the first 2 films (which I would rate 5 stars) and impressed by the entire concept and effort. Even in the 2nd film, I was startled by how visibly Julie Delpy had aged, but the romantic magic was still very much alive and full of promise. However, after viewing the 3rd installment, I have to question whether a 4th episode is a good idea.  'Before Midnight' is too much like real life, wherein the daily grind of work and caring for young kids steals the joy from a relationship and often, as in this case, crushes the dreams and personal ambitions of a woman who devotes most of her time and energy to being a mom.  What disturbed me most of all in this 3rd movie (again, I'm not saying it is unrealistic-it is perhaps TOO real), was the argument which took-up the last quarter of the film.  That dead look in her eyes made my skin crawl and I've seen it in real life. Once romance has died to that extent (in the eyes of either participant), it ain't likely to come back. Hawke's character valiantly tries to salvage something, but at best, things will never again be quite the same as they once were. Also, when one person starts seeing so many negatives in the other, it is cancer to their partnership. To depict otherwise in a 4th installment, would probably be a lie, but then maybe we need that sort of closure, to finally put the dagger of reality into what began as a inspiring romance and finally end it, with possibly the 2 characters deciding to part?  Perhaps a 4th episode is as inevitable as aging and becoming jaded is, in reality?  I'm also afraid that seeing them as fifty-something seniors, might be as grotesque and sad as real life? It will require some brilliant writing to give this series a happy ending. Only if Julie overcomes all the international obstacles and realizes her potential, would a happy outcome be possible. However, I am grateful to all the writers, director, actors, and producers who made this series happen.  It stands as a unique achievement in storytelling and film making and what they've already accomplished is no less than brilliant.

I didn't expect this because I thought there was no way to continue the story after the ending scene of Before Sunset. But filmmakers including director Richard Linklater seem to think differently. In the new chapter Before Midnight Jesse and Celine are facing midlife crisis and other problems.

Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are spending the summer in Greece. Nine years have passed since the ending of the previous film, and Jesse is now a successful writer while Celine is an environmental activist. They have cute twin daughters but seem a little unhappy. And it goes on and on.

The problem about the latest entry in the Before trilogy is that the characters and their love story is no longer refreshing for fans of the previous films. Their intellectual dialogue can hardly cover the fact that whatever they are complaining of or arguing over has been done somewhere else countless times. Yes, of course, even Jesse and Celine, having lived together for nine years, can quarrel endlessly, but is this what we want to see after watching Before Sunrise and Before Sunset?

After all it is all up to you whether you like Before Midnight or not. Continuation of Before Sunset is a love story, but not of the same kind as the one in Sunset and Sunrise. I saw Sunset and Sunrise and liked both of them for the romantic mood and palpable sense of time is running out for Jesse and Celine. Now they have plenty of time to talk, and sorry, thats not very interesting to me.",1393459200,5,1591,4.715827338129497

5820335,2,B00DJYJPLO,"Even though i'm the type that would typically choose a Van Damme kickfest over a Parisian chick flick, I actually saw Before Sunrise when it was released in theaters. I've been an Ethan Hawke fan since Explorers, and so I was willing to give the movie a try. I ended up really enjoying it. I'd give it a 9.5/10 and It's probably one of my top ten favorite films.

Before Sunset was a not entirely necessary sequel, but it did bring the first film full circle and answered the questions most of us who saw the first film were dying to have answered. It was certainly enjoyable and the ending was very satisfying, Although overall i don't believe it was as memorable or as powerful as the first film. I'd give it an 8/10.

Before Midnight really ruins the fairy tale story built up by the first two films and consists of Jesse and Celine mostly arguing. The first half starts out interesting and feels like the previous two films, but there are hints of arguing and negativity in the first half that then blow up in the second half and turn the last 45 minutes into nothing but arguing. Yes, i get that it is ""real"" and that most marriages have rough patches, and given the circumstances that have led them to somehow survive as a couple it is inevitable that they will feel regret over some of the compromises each has had to make in somehow making their lives together work. I understand, I get it. But ultimately I ask: Was this enjoyable to watch on film? No. It was tedious to sit through and it made me depressed and angry that the story of Before Sunrise turned into this. The thought that those two interesting people whose souls fatefully crossed paths on that train and had a life-altering experience over the course of a single night as strangers in a foreign city wind up in just as crappy of a marriage as many typical suburbanites burns me up inside. Their story deserves better than that.",1393113600,25,1901,4.459770114942529

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

Richard Linklater has served up a good number of worthy cinematic items in the past decade including 'School of Rock', 'Fast Food Nation', 'Me and Orson Welles' and 'Bernie'. He also has the two prequels to 'Before Midnight', ''Before Sunrise' and 'Before Sunset', which I have not seen, but hear were pretty good. 'Before Midnight' picks up the story nine years later, with novelist and part-time professor Jesse (Ethan Hawke) dropping off his son at the airport on the Greek Pelopennese peninsula where he's been vacationing with wife Cline (Julie Delpy) and their two young twin daughters (Seamus Davy-Fitzpatrick is a knockout as Jesse's son sensitive son, Hank, who we meet briefly at the beginning of the film).

The unfortunate thing about 'Before Midnight' is that for two-thirds of the film, it violates the screenwriter's canon which is of course, 'show don't tell'. Sure there are films that are dialogue heavy and sometimes they work well, especially in the case of a courtroom drama. But 'Before Midnight' is not a courtroom drama. It's an examination of a relationship between a long-time married couple, possibly coming apart at the seams. But until the gripping conclusion, there is little conflict.

Instead, we're treated to a great deal of witty banter between the principals, some of which is quite interesting, but in the end, hardly memorable. To make matters worse, some of these conversations take place in one spot--the worst of which occurs as Jesse and Cline (along with their two children who hardly play a role at all in the story) drone on and on inside their car, as they drive from the airport, after dropping off Jesse's son. It's maddening to sit there with the camera never shifting an iota, as the two principals converse.

Things improve slightly when Jesse and Cline arrive at the home of a Greek writer friend and there are other adults there, including the writer's son and his wife, who add their two cents regarding life's travails. Perhaps the highlight there is Delpy's seductive Marilyn Monroe impersonation. Later, Jesse and Cline take a long walk through a tourist spot, ending up inside an ancient Greek Orthodox shrine (there Cline makes some rather sacrilegious sexual comments which weren't very amusing).

'Before Midnight' finally picks up when Jesse and Cline return to their hotel room and go at one another. At last the characters seem to find their voice and the conflict becomes apparent. Jesse is accused by Cline of focusing too much on his son, to the detriment of their relationship. And Cline in Jesse's eyes is a whiner who seeks approbation as a beleaguered feminist. Clearly the more nuanced portrait of the two is that of Cline, who really does come off as unreasonable and neurotic. It's only through Jesse's patience that the ship finally is righted and the relationship is restored to a semblance of equilibrium.

Clearly 'Before Midnight' is one of the overrated indies of the year. Yes, one must admire the witty repartee between Hawke and Delpy as well as the high intellectual level in most of the dialogue throughout the film. Nonetheless, as noted above, one becomes restless for the central conflict to emerge and overwhelmed by the amount of dialogue. With so many ideas tossed about, it's hard to remember hardly any of them--those who have seen the film more than once, probably could appreciate it more. A healthy balance between all the ideas and the visuals is what 'Before Midnight' really needed. Unfortunately, the film remains top heavy with so much dialogue, that it ends up too heavily weighted toward the intellect, than to the heart.",1392854400,,3690,4.961165048543689

5820344,5,B00DJYJPLO,"I watched ""Before Sunset"" very recently, and as I realized there was a third film, I pondered where it might go and which roads they may travel in this latest (last??) film.  I had *hoped* they would not go there ... there being the place where we know marriages can go (they forshadowed it in the first scene in ""Before Sunrise"" when the other couple on the train engaged in a long, heated argument).

Anyway - they did go there, and in watching it exposed a lot of my own open wounds.  It was hard to watch - touching, sad, painful and emotional.  It's so rare that a movie actually makes me FEEL something, and after this one I felt as though I had been sucker punched.

The dialogue is so well thought out, and these actors are just so good at what they do.  At this point, we know these characters and can maybe even predict what they will do or say.  The direct camera angle contributes to the viewer's feeling of being right there, being a part of these two characters and their trials and pain.  I feel for both of them.

I honestly didn't ""like"" this movie and I certainly would never watch it again - it was painful and reminded me a lot of my own relationships.  However, it was so well written, performed and delivered, it gripped my heart.",1392595200,2,1252,4.311965811965812
5820345,1,B00DJYJPLO,"Are you kidding me? Sure, we all enjoyed the first movie in this series, but I was looking for redemption in this one after the second movie tanked (in no small part due to Ethan Hawke bringing out Jesses weasley side). But to echo the sentiments of another reviewer about Before Midnight, people watch movies to escape their existential angst, not watch others complain about it. Seriously, a 17 minute long conversation in the car on the way back from the airport that is 95% irrelevant? To open the movie? What? There is no plot, simply an assembly of characters whining about the poor decisions they've made in their lives. Ccile particularly comes across as an absolute you-know-what this go-round. And what the heck with the constant references to Skype? Is Skype hard up for advertising? Sheesh. An absolute snoozefest, I can't believe we made it halfway through.

This third movie takes place 18 years after the first, and the couple are at a writers' retreat in Greece. While in the first 2, Jesse and Celine sort of have each other on pedestals and each sees the other as a unique, enthralling person because of the short amount of time they've spent together but the intense bond they've formed, this movie shows the state of their lives after being together for 9 years. It's nice and almost refreshing to see that even though their meeting was so magical, they've experienced many of the same rollercoasters and fights as average, everyday couples. Yet they still have something special, and it's also refreshing to see that even when they fall into some of the arguments and negativity that break up couples every day, their love can withstand it. The end definitely leaves things open for a 4th, and I hope we get to see where they are in 9 more years.",1392076800,,996,4.538888888888889
5820349,1,B00DJYJPLO,"Saw and thoroughly enjoyed the first film in this 3 film series 20 years ago. A film based virtually on dialog alone between two new lovers was fresh, innovative, creative, mature and most importantly entertaining. Linklater hit it out of the park. And likewise, the follow up film 10 years later was a very creative and bold concept (where are they now?), again just dialog between the same two characters, was captivating. Sadly, the third installment was for the last half of the film close to unwatchable. For me, 2 clear problems. The construction of Linklater's first two films are by now no longer innovative or fresh. The cleverness is gone. We are no longer enthralled by this ""different"" film construction. As a result, the dialog between the same two characters in episode 3 had to be the best yet. It was in fact, the worst. In just under 2 hours we watched a married couple talk themselves into a divorce. Actually in just under an hour because the first hour they were not manufacturing ""dialog of dislike"" just to show ""reality"" in a 20 year old marriage. Utterly pretentious. Secondly, Delpy's character is so unlikeable, so full of self-hatred and bitterness because she chose marriage and it's responsibilities vis a' vis Hawke who continues to talk of total love and commitment, is preposterous. Her character is completely neurotic, whiny, and bitchy and his is just as wacked as Hawke comes off as a man with saint-like patience and understanding for a wife who is borderline schizophrenic. The ""reality"" of this third episode was just pretention and over-acting.

So much of adulthood is dealing with decisions we made when we were too young to know what we needed or wanted 50 years later! Just when they are about to become very intimate, they pull away and reignite their core challenges.

This particular movie was difficult for me to watch because it's so real and quite painful but that's my problem. Lots of people have negative comments about Celine's character during the fight scenes. Her behavior during the fight didn't bother me so much because people can say and do crazy things in anger. However I was bothered twice by her character when they weren't fighting. I was shocked right at the beginning when she was waiting for Jesse to say good bye to his son and she knew it would be emotional for him and he comes out of the airport and there is no compassion for him whatsoever. She's on her cellphone rattling about. I was thinking the previous Celine was more empathic and compassionate. And then when Jesse tells her that his grandmother has just died, you find out that Celine never met his grandmother in all that time. And she makes it clear that she doesn't want to go to the funeral with him. I thought that was a bit sad. This was all well before the fight and I guess that's when I realized this film wasn't going to be like the first two.

5820427,5,B00DJYJPLO,"Watching ""Before Midnight,"" one is struck by how shallow and superficial most movies dealing with love and romance truly are.

Principal credit goes to writer/director Richard Linklater, who has the uncanny gift for making all the dialogue he writes sound 100% real - given an invaluable assist from a cast of brilliant ad-libbing actors, that is. This talent is something he's demonstrated over and over again in his unique and utterly indispensable longitudinal study in romance: ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), ""Before Sunset"" (2004) and now his piece de resistance, ""Before Midnight.""

The ""Before"" trilogy is similar to the ""Up"" documentary series, only instead of checking into the lives of some actual people every seven years as Michael Apted does, Linklater goes back to the same fictional couple every decade or so to see how it is they`re faring. When we first met Celine and Jesse in ""Before Sunrise,""  they  were two strangers in their twenties who, after a chance meeting aboard a train, proceeded to spend a romantic, albeit platonic, evening together in Vienna before he headed back to his home in the States and she to her life as a student in Paris. Though they vowed to reunite in six months time, they never actually did so.

When, nine years later, they encountered each other again, at a book-signing in Paris, Jesse had become a successful writer, having used his encounter with Celine as fodder for a worldwide best seller, thereby capturing both her and the moment they shared in print forever. In his thirties at this point, Jesse revealed that he was married with a son, but that the marriage was an unhappy one. Celine, an environmental activist, had a boyfriend she rarely saw due to his job as a photojournalist. ""Before Sunset"" faded out on them finally consummating their relationship.

As ""Before Midnight"" opens, we learn that Celine and Jesse have indeed become a couple and have twin daughters conceived in their night of passion. Jesse broods over the fact that he is living a continent away from his now-teenaged son , whom he gets to see only during the summer. Meanwhile, Celine, Jesse and the girls are spending their vacation traveling around Greece, staying with friends at a beautiful villa and taking in the sights.

If ""Before Midnight"" reminds us of any film, it is Stanley Donen's great 1967 romance ""Two For the Road,"" with Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney as the long-married couple - also traveling through Europe - who have begun to take the long view of their relationship, examining how love and individuals change, sometimes for the better but often for the worse, over time (with its time-shifting narrative, Donen was able to accomplish in one movie what Linklater takes three to do - not that that in any way diminishes the achievement). Unlike most romantic dramas, which end just as the relationships are starting to become interesting, ""Two for the Road"" and ""Before Midnight"" hurtle bravely on into the future, to a point long after the initial concerns and rituals of courtship and giddy romance have faded and the realities and concerns of a far more prosaic everyday life have come to take their place.

Infidelity, the demands of parenthood, the pressures of work and career, the idealism of youth fading into the cynicism and compromises of middle age - all these issues are put under the microscope and brought into sharp focus in ""Before Midnight,"" which clearly shows that Celine and Jesse are not the same people they were when we first met them - nor should we expect them to be. For life is not static, and neither are the people who are constantly being molded and shaped by the experiences it throws at them. The characters here talk about love and relationships with a depth and insight rarely found in even the most profound of personal dramas.

Eschewing the plot mechanics and melodramatic contrivance that gum up so many movie romances, ""Before Midnight"" consists mainly of long, often single-take scenes that capture with uncanny accuracy the rhythm and flow of natural conversation. Jesse and Celine know each other so well - have become so comfortably intimate with one another as a couple - that they can talk about a wide range of topics, from the most trivial to the most profound, and not miss a beat, secure in the knowledge that the bond between them is stronger than anything they might express in words. That's how come they are able to emerge intact from a particularly withering half-hour-long argument in a hotel room in which souls are bared and long-simmering grievances are finally brought out into the open.

Of course, the series could never be what it has become without the stellar work of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, two outstanding actors who have literally come to inhabit these characters over the course of three decades. Together they perfectly embody Linklater`s vision of what a real romantic couple looks and sounds like at various stages in their relationship. And it's all enhanced by a lovely musical score by Graham Reynolds that nicely brings out the romantic flavor of the piece.

The idea that two distinct and strong-willed individuals can exist both as separate entities and as a couple - and make it work - is the thesis that informs every moment of ""Before Midnight.""  In his series, Linklater has wiped away the gauze that enwraps most movie romances to show us the real and vital thing that beats underneath. And, in so doing, he raises the bar that all future filmmakers, working in the genre from hereon out, will need to try to reach.",1389657600,4,5554,4.871822033898305

I tried my best to enjoy them while taking a rest from work, but I couldn't relate.
The characters were so self-absorbed that they were difficult to like. It was a chore to finish this last movie. Perhaps that was the point, but there are better ways to spend my time.

For one, I am an avid traveler, so watching these films, Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and a Before Midnight offers a unique, exciting, and satisfying surrogate for Euro-travel. The movie is dialogue driven so there's a lot to absorb, but it never wavers and I'm impressed at how Ethan, Julie, and Linklater can craft a movie where the dialogue stays strong and carefully avoids being ""on the nose"" or too cheeky or too self-important. The evolution of love and the myriad ways it manifests is the essential meditation here, and it will leave you wanting more, pensive, and hungry to go on an adventure.",1389571200,5,731,4.809523809523809

5820477,5,B00DJYJPLO,"Well, I've reviewed a bunch of stuff on Amazon, but never a romance movie - what is this world coming to?

So, a little background - I watched Before Sunrise back in the 90's while in college and it fired up my longing for meeting a beautiful European girl while traveling through Vienna. Yeah, okay, so that never happened, but it still helped me identify what kind of sappy love movies I liked to watch with no one around.

To be honest, I totally forgot about the movie until it was playing recently on a movie channel. I then discovered Before Sunset came out in 2004 and Before Midnight in 2013. Sunset also validated that longing within me for a good love story. That waltz guitar solo Celine plays near the end just gets me, I love it.

So it makes sense to watch Before Midnight to pick up the last (?) chapter of the story. It's sort of weird, but their relationship in ways mimics most of ours right? Heavy romance, starry eyes, ""sweet cakes and milkshakes"" to start it off. Then eventually reality gets to all of us. The daily doldrums of responsibility, jobs and kids eats away some of that energy. But underneath it all, that love is still there somewhere and you have to work for it to keep it.

I would never have thought it could be better than the first two, but it is!  I'm glad to see that it is also receiving the critical acclaim it deserves.

It seems some of the other reviewers here were expecting a more typical romance or drama, such as...
-something ""happens"", like an accident or very serious and specific ""situation"", or,
-the two main characters are normal people without any problems (such as her emotional instability), or,
-even just a standard PLOT with a ""situation"" and a ""resolution"".

This movie has none of these things, which might be why it felt so REAL.

I guess I'd just call it part romance, part stream-of-consciousness, but done to an extreme level of absolute perfection.  The (three) writers of this film (which include the two main actors), were clearly not trying to sell tickets here.  They were trying to do something much deeper that meant something to themselves.  For those of us lucky enough to go along for the ride, it is a helluva ride!

Having the first two movies as background just added to the depth of feeling contained here.  And of course, the acting was absolutely top-notch.

5820584,4,B00DJYJPLO,"I really, really liked this film - that said, it was not easy to watch. I so enjoyed the first two films. Before Sunrise is one of my all time favorite films. It reminded me of a few chance meetings I had myself while traveling in Europe. Once, I met a wonderful Brazilian man in Florence. We both showed up at the train station without a booked room. He approached me and asked if I wanted to share a hotel. We ended up spending several days together exploring Florence, Pisa and the countryside. I spent a month in Italy and camera and all my film (yes, it was a while back) was stolen in the south of France. This guy sent me a photo of us in front of the Ponte Vecchio which is the only photo of my fantastic trip to Italy. It was a wonderful, wonderful memory and I think that is where it needs to stay. A memory. I think Jesse (Ethan Hawke) should have left Vienna in Vienna. Most movies are an escape from reality and do not represent real life. Before Midnight is what REALLY happens after the romance, after reality kicks in. And does it KICK-IN. At one point Jesse's character calls Celine the mayor of crazy town, but I think it is him that is crazy. He had this built-up fantasy of who Celine is and what their relationship should be. But I do believe he loves her and it could go either way at this point. I am just really happy I watched this film because sometimes when my life is s*****, I wonder what would have happened if I had run off with that Brazilian guy but the truth is, my life would probably still end up being s***** sometimes.

5820602,4,B00DJYJPLO,"It seems hard to believe but it's been 19 years since director Richard Linklater and actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy brought out a surprising hit romantic film with BEFORE SUNRISE. That movie captured audiences slowly and became not only a great date film but a movie that showed two young people who meet on a train, spend time together and fall in love, even if only for one night. Ten years later they followed that up with BEFORE SUNSET and had Hawke's character Jesse, a successful writer who wrote about that evening, meeting up with Delpy's Celine once again. Both movies left an open ending with people unsure of what happened next. BEFORE MIDNIGHT answers some of those questions and leaves new ones by the end of the film.

It is now 9 years since the last film and Jesse has left behind his wife and family to be with Celine. The pair have two children of their own, twin girls who are the light of their lives. The film opens with them about to end a vacation in Greece and Jesse taking his son Hank to the airport to fly home. His wife has custody and as they part, Jesse begins to dwell on his responsibility to his son and feeling how he hasn't been there for him. As he and Celine drive back to where they are staying, the home of another author they were invited to, they discuss their lives; what each one wants, Celine's possibly taking a job in Paris, Jesse feeling that he should be nearer Hank and what they both want from life.

In a nutshell all things stem from those questions. The second segment has them at the friend's house over dinner where different couples relate their own views of love and relationships. From there it moves on to a walk that Celine and Jesse take through town. The last act ends up with them in a hotel room their friends have presented to them as a gift, a chance to get away from the crowd and the kids for a nice romantic evening. Oddly enough things never seem to turn out as planned.

What could sound like a boring film is actually quite entertaining and interesting. There is no action and no extended scenes of lovemaking. Instead the art of conversation is seen from beginning to end. The fact that these actors could play through these scenes seamlessly is a credit to their abilities. From the conversation in the car to the round table discussion over dinner, every actor does an amazing job. The culmination of the relationship between Jesse and Celine at the hotel room is stunning to watch and as accurate a depiction of real life and romance as one will see in a film.

It is obvious that both characters are in love with one another but the selfish side for each comes out at the worst possible moments and leads to one misunderstanding after another. Anyone in a long term relationship knows that wrong things are said, meanings are misunderstood and that love fluctuates from infatuation to anger in the blink of an eye. All of that is represented in this film as the pair tries to find the love they shared through the years. While we might all dream of storybook/fairy tale romance, the reality is always much different but also much deeper.

I watched this film at the end of the night, tired and fearful that I might fall asleep not due to the film but because of the hour.

5820605,4,B00DJYJPLO,"I viewed the first film in this trilogy, missed the second and onto the third. It could very well be a stand alone film, it will resonate with many of us, married or not.

Ethan Hawkes, plays Jesse, a world renowned writer, married to Celine, played by Julie Delpy. Both in their forties now. They met as young people on a train, together for a short while, then split and found each other again. Now, with two young beautiful daughters. His dreams realized, hers , not so much. Celine wants a career, her dream job. Jesse has just left his son off at the airport to make his sojourn home from Greece to Chicago. He feels much grief for not being there for his son. Left with a crazy, alcoholic mother who hates Jesse and his new wife. Much regret, as they try to work it out during this film.

Celine, on the other Gand, has regrets and pent up desires. She has left her desires to make her life with her family. During this film, both Jesse and Celine, discuss in a constant compnversation their life, their wants, their desires, what is wrong and finally what is right.

This is a gentle film with a lot of foundation. We learn a great deal from this couple, about themselves, and about ourselves. It will resonate, as I said, with everyone. Where are you in your life, what is missing, what is right, what more needs to be done. Can we meet and face these issues  up front? A film for everyone.

5820606,5,B00DJYJPLO,"Before Midnight (2013) was directed by Richard Linklater and stars Ethan Hawke and lovely Julie Delpy.

After the delightful fairy tale romances of Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), we now find Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) as a middle-aged couple dealing with long distance parenting, job dissatisfaction, expanding waistlines and upper-arm flab. The bloom is apparently off the rose as tensions mount on the last days of Jesse and Celine's vacation on the scenic Peloponnese Peninsula in Greece and the relationship seems headed for the rocks. Or is it just everyday estrogenic hysteria?

Hawke and Delpy give exquisite performances. Every viewer who has ever been in a relationship can relate intimately to Jesse and Celine's sturm and drang. The hotel scene is guaranteed to raise the hairs on the back of every man's neck. Oy vey! Such realism! Such authenticity! It was as if I was experiencing the quarrel myself. Bravo to the director and performers! Bravo! Bravo!

Ach! I'm tired after having to deal with all of Celine's drama. Time to take a nap. What's that? Time to take out the trash? Yes, dear. Coming, dear. Ach.

p.s. I realize the ""Before..."" movies aren't for everybody but the large number of 1 and 2-star reviews proves once again that Jed and the other Clampetts and Bodines may want to think twice before viewing anything more sophisticated than The Fast and The Furious.",1388188800,,1411,4.991489361702127

Like the first 3 movies, this movie doesn't follow the typical narrative tradition. Each movie is more or less an hour and a half of two people talking. The changes this couple goes through however, is truly brilliant. This film is the most dramatic of the three, as there are more obstacles in their relationship (some real, some imaginary) than ever before

The chemistry between the two actors is incredible. How they manage to move in and out of different moods with each other will remind many of their own relationship, or those of their parents.

If a movie can make me cry, I typically regard it highly. This was no exception. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who has ever been in a relationship, or who wants to be in one.",1387584000,3,809,4.56551724137931

5820646,3,B00DJYJPLO,"Hate to say it, but the third installment in the trilogy is the weakest. Good conversation, which is the heart and soul of all three movies, but the conversation was better in the first two. The thing that really disappointed me was the nudity in Before Midnight. It was completely unnecessary.
The whole reason that Before Sunrise and Before Sunset were such great little films was because of the intellectual, emotional and  sexual tension between the characters, and the viewer was able to appreciate this without seeing any skin.
Before Midnight has its moments of greatness, but Julie Delpy going topless brought nothing of value to the main theme / question of the movie, which is this - after all these years, would they still make the same choices they made at that train station?
Overall, the idea of continuing the story between these characters rates a 5, the gratuitous nudity rates a 1, which leaves me with a 3 star rating.
I hope that these characters are revisited in a few years with  new movie. The girls will be older, Jesse's son will be an adult, and our two love birds will be approaching decisions about retirement and their legacy.

The table scene was the hightlight of this film but it goes quickly downhill from there.  The bedroom scene is where the film gets away from Richard Linklater's vision for these characters.  And this is where Linklater should have stepped in as director.  He tried to fix this mess in the end but it was too late by then.

The development of the characters (from the first and second film) is interesting - I kept thinking about the transformation of Celine and Jessie since we first met them back in the 90s, and the more I thought about it, the more it made sense that they would be who they are in this third installment. Jessie's (E.Hawke) first broken marriage weighs heavily on him and makes him focused on a bigger picture - he wants to make his second marriage work. While Celine (J.Delpy), the once exciting, romantic girl has now been almost entirely consumed by daily battles, and caring for their children. The third part consists almost entirely of the two main characters fighting and it's so well written and fantastically acted that it is almost hard to watch.

Some of the scenes actually pained me and felt uncomfortable yet at the same time I had to marvel at how real it was. I absolutely believed that Celine and Jesse's relationship could reach this crossroads. At the same time, I had to admit that this is what a middle-aged couple with kids would act and fight, even with such a romantic beginning as they did. Not every couple has a storied origin as Celine and Jesse - first meeting on a train and spending one night in Vienna together then meeting nine years later in Paris for one afternoon - but this movie reminds us that fairy tales don't last forever.

The 1 star reviews almost universally complain ""TOO MUCH DIALOG"".  The 5 star reviews (often after 15 paragraphs) exclaim ""lots of really great dialog"".  I suggest you make your purchase/rent decision on whether you want a video game experience or an in-your-head dialog-based experience.

Sociopaths aside, it seems we spend a lifetime trying to pierce those barriers we erect and to really touch and understand those we love.  These three movies are about a pair doing just that with very human success and failure and ebb and flow and joy and despair.  It works for me.

It starts with man and child in airport talking for a long period of time. It was billed at redbox as this really cool love story, so I am suspicious from the get-go.

 It moves to same man in car with his wife talking FOREVER. Seriously. We have one camera on them and we listen for at least five minutes as they talk about almost nothing.

And then same man with 2 other men sitting on patio talking FOREVER. I am well aware by this point that I have been taken.

We have the woman cooking with other women and again, scene is wordy and forever. Dinner...on and on they all talk. Then same man walking with woman talking again FOREVER. Why film it?

She was a virgin and died burning at the stake."" I was surprised that comment was made by a French citizen knowing Joan is the Patron Saint of France. Was it necessary to tell us how her Mother would kill baby kittens in plastic bags?  The film was insulting and I would never watch it again.",1384905600,5,591,4.267857142857143
5820831,5,B00DJYJPLO,"In a film market dominated by big commercial releases and the usual formulaic approach, Linklater et al have done an excellent job in presenting an alternative to the 'romantic comedy' formula.

Instead of the airbrushed depiction of romance, here we have what feels like a real relationship with its very real hurdles.  Jesse and Celine are now in their 40's, navigating the hassles of dealing with a blended family and ex-spouses, conflicts between pursuing one's career and spending time with the children.  It's a more mature film than the last two of the series, and definitely 'darker'.

Like the previous two films before it, the main focus is on the relationship between the two leads.  Most of the scenes are long, and made to seem like a natural dialogue with its many digressions and irrelevancies.  You may be forgiven to think the scenes were improvised.  On closer examination, all the little dialogue digressions do have a point.

Without giving the plot away, I can divide the film into 4 main parts.  Followed by the opening airport scene where Jesse farewells his son (from his previous marriage) who is going back to his mother's, we have Jesse, Celine, and their twin daughters in a long scene (which was taken almost in one shot) in a car - travelling on vacation in Greece to meet friends.  We are dropped right into their lives, and the scene basically serves as background to allow us to catch up on what's been happening to them since we last met them 9 years ago.  This was followed by a couple of scenes around a Greek house where we meet other characters - a young couple much like Jesse and Celine might have been years ago; another couple in their 40's; and an older widow and widower who were dealing with their losses in different ways.  This was a departure from the previous two films in that there are interesting characters beyond the lead couple.  The long lunchtable scene was particularly memorable for the spontaneous conversations, always leading back to the topic of relationships.  After that a long stroll with just Jesse and Celine talking/philosophising takes the audience right back to their similar interactions in the first film Before Sunrise.  As they arrived at the hotel (for a romantic night organised by their friends), this led up to the climax of the film where the tension in the relationship culminates in what I think to be the most realistic depiction of a couple's fighting.

The cinematography is adequate and the scenic backdrop is gorgeous even though that's not the point of the film.  An original soundtrack was used for the first time in this set of films - it's very sparingly used but effective.  It is the writing and the acting, as would be expected, that matters most in this exploration of a relationship.  The minor characters are all likeable and believable, but it is Delpy and Hawke's acting (without making it look like acting) that really makes this film.  (The leads also share the credits for the writing with Linklater.)  What's equally impressive is the matching between the chronology of the three films and real life - the actors aged fairly closely to the films.  This film achieves the best intention of 'reality TV/documentary' using totally fictitious characters.

Reading some online reviews, I think this film polarises audience - you either love it or hate it.  There would be a few who watched this film without knowing anything about the previous two - and if you did that you will not enjoy this film to its potential.  Then there are those who do not enjoy the intense conversations.  Yes the film is a 'talkfest'.  If you don't like this sort of thing, then steer clear from it.  And then, there are reviewers who disliked the film's depiction of a relationship - finding the realism too stark - these reviewers tend to like the first two films (or at least the first one).  To this I will only say that this is not your usual rom-com, and the audience needs to be prepared for possibly confronting themes (despite the idyllic setting!)

I didn't fully explore the special DVD features but the commentary by Linklater, Hawke and Delpy was fascinating - a must for anyone who enjoyed the film and wants to find out about the writing process.",1384905600,,4238,4.765753424657534
5820832,1,B00DJYJPLO,"The entire ""Before"" series is very polarizing.  You either love the movies or hate them (e.g.  at the time of this review there were 35 five-star reviews and 21 one-star reviews).  If you enjoy hearing the conversations of two lovers for long periods of time, you'll love these movies.  For some, seeing the flirtation, deep thoughts,  and up/downs between the lovers can be entertaining.  There aren't many side stories (if any) in these movies.  There aren't many characters (usually only two).  There are scenes where dialogue happens continuously for what seems like 20 minutes.

I didn't want to watch ""Before Midnight"", having seen the first movie.  However, my wife enjoyed the first two movies and I watched to support her.  This movie had some new characters and the relationship between the two main characters has evolved significantly since the first movie.  Some of the scenery in the movie was beautiful.

But this one tops them because this one has that incredibly difficult scene in the hotel room (no spoilers here).

If you have ever had a rocky patch in your married relationship, this movie does the best job of addressing so much of the baseline difference between men and women and their most important relationships. Delphi and Hawke are flawless in their takes on the characters in the piece and especially in their place in time. This story has a very difficult set of criteria to match when actors have to play the same characters over en extended period of time. The ""Trilogy"" visits the two characters in their 20's, 30's and 40's and the movies were made approximately 9 years apart and that is perfect because of the natural aging processes and the deeper maturation processes of the actors. The ""Midnight"" story conclusion does the best in dealing with those tricky conclusion situations of any movie I have watched.

5820870,2,B00DJYJPLO,"""Before Midnight"" is the third and probably last installment of romantic films starring Julia Delpy and Ethan Hawke as lovers Celine and Jesse.  The first film featured the couple as fresh-faced twenty-somethings in ""Before Sunrise"" back in 1994.  The subsequent films follow ""Sunrise's"" template; extremely talky, low-budget affairs set in picturesque European locales.  The third is set in Greece.  The length of intervals between films permits the viewer to see the actors/characters age and develop over the years.

The second film, ""Before Sunset,"" established a tragic ""Affair to Remember"" type of scenario in which the lovers failed to reunite at the appointed time.  It ended on a hopeful note in which it appeared that - despite other relationships - the couple would finally be together.

The theme of the third installment is: ""Be careful what you wish for.""  The promise of the earlier films has turned into poison as the couple struggles with vindictive exes, long-distance parenting, professional and marital dissatisfaction, and suppressed resentments.  The final act of ""Before Midnight"" is a long, ugly domestic fight in which Celine and Jesse say countless unforgivable things; the flaws which they were willing to gloss over in the past become ammunition for the nastiest character assassination game since ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.""

Like its predecessors, ""Before Midnight"" has a flat, talky, pseudo-documentary feel that rings true.  The only false note comes at the end of the film; its hopeful tone comes long after the viewer knows that too many hateful things have been said to ever allow a reconciliation.",1384300800,6,1639,5.313953488372093

I was waiting and waiting for some action, but found myself pulled in by the witty and natural exchanges between are two lovers (haters?) and anticipating the build up to the next mood change.
As far as the dialogue I was looking for the editing breaks in scenes so that I could appreciate the length of time they were able to memorize their exchanges. Au contraire, the acting left me laying odds I was listening to a spontaneous improv tete-a-tete performance. Yes, it did drag at times but that's how conversations can go.
Yes, a few not-so-polite words which I am critical of when a writer uses them as a cheap hook to give a character or movie toughness, but in this case I thought it was spot-on appropriate to emotionalize our character's feelings towards each other.

In Before Sunrise, Celine meets Jesse in Paris and we get to know them better. All three movies are directed by Richard Linklater, one of America's best directors.

5820951,2,B00DJYJPLO,"I have been a big fan of this series for eighteen years.  I like the characters, acting, dialog, and they way Jesse, and Celine connect.  But this third movie in the franchise took everything I liked, and used it as a bludgeon of negativity.  It was exhausting to watch.
If you liked the romanticism of the first two movies, I highly recommend not watching this film, because ""Before Midnight"" will  tarnish them.

***This Part Has Spoilers***

Celine has become a self obsesses, uncompromising,  miserable, mean-spirited, drama queen.  Living in her own self created world of pessimism, cynical delusions, and dissatisfaction.  Trapped in the juvenile, militant, feminist dogma of a first year woman's study major.  Basically taking the position of  ""My job is more important than us living close to your son for a few years even though not being around him is breaking your heart"".  It reminded me of a response someone had written about the movie ""The Five Years Engagement"" called ""How Hollywood Portrays Women as Evil(or something like that)"".  Seriously, it is one of the worst depictions of a female character I have seen in a long time.

Jesse, is still Peter Pan-ing it a bit, while also coming to grips with getting older.  He kind of  yo-yo's between trying to be reasonable, and understanding, then getting  pulled into Celine's negativity, and saying something terrible.  In the end, I think the only way the creators thought they could balance out  Jesse with Celine's awfulness was to throw in the last minute ""Jesse cheated on Celine"".  I really did not like that.  First, because it seemed out character for Jesse, and second it's arbitrariness.

I am not sure understand the story this movie is trying to tell.  My assumption is ""Hey let's make a movie about the worst fight these two will ever have, and can they survive it."", or was it more ""A day in the life"", ""this is their dynamic."".  Either way I thought it was over the top, and incredibly mean spirited.  I am sure some will say with how ""honest"", and ""realistic"" this movie is.  Maybe so, but only in its own, warped,  self defining reality.",1383436800,14,2119,4.797783933518006

Critics seem to like the movies with a lot of foul language and negativity, which is pretty
much the only way I can describe this horrible movie. Constant foul language does not make
a film artsy...it makes the characters come across as too ignorant to find a better word to use.

What couple talks & talks like they did the first half of the movie without interjecting some off the topic comments.  The conversations were too rehearsed in that there was no believability in them.  By the time they made it to the hotel room I was disgusted.  Delphys character turned into the biggest bitch and Hawke turned in to the most graveling husband and I was sickened by him.  When she left the hotel room in a huff I could NOT understand why Hawke's character would bother going to look for her.  I would have thought  - let that bitch go stew in her own hatefulness.  I could not stand either one of them.
Delphy's dress was saggy and gross and didn't help her character at all.  She seemed so raggin on herself & so selfish at the end that she made me mad.  I wouldn't waste my $ on this movie.  It could have been so much better had the writers created a more loving or understandable characters they had evolved into instead of hateful, bitter old crows.  This is just my opinion.

5821027,3,B00DJYJPLO,"From the very first of the ""Before..."" movies, the ""action"", such as exists, takes off when The Conversation takes off, which in the first two is when they start walking about.  In this installment, the movie is almost half over before they really get talking.  Of course, a lot has changed:  They're middle aged, divorced, and remarried (to each other) and have twin girls.  They have commitments.  They have baggage.  Still, when the conversation finally takes off, it very quickly becomes a bicker fest.

She starts it off with a simple question:  Would you still ask me to get off the train with you?  One could imagine he's hearing that at almost every anniversary and probably does away with it by smiling, saying ""Of course"", adding a bit of flattery, and perhaps a kiss.  For what ever reason, this time he hesitates, and then he stammers, and now she feels old and fat.  To make matters worse, he's just said good bye to the son he lost via his own divorce;  now a teenager, he's just finished a summer in Greece, and wow, far from being the adorable talking pet little kids are, he's almost human.  You can converse with him, most of the time.  And Dad wants more.  Unfortunately, he wants it all, the best of his old life, and his new French family.  Needless to say, the wife isn't at all amused at his suggestion they uproot and move to Chicago, the proximity of the spurned wife hardly being the least of the attractions.  So off they go on their squabble.

As film arguments go, this is not a notable fight.  One thinks of the nastiness of ""Long Days Journey Into Night"", or the epic booze filled brawl between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolfe"", where two puffy actors, beyond their physical prime,  go at it, round and round, until the climax where, in a white rage of hate and bitterness, not a single drop of self loathing and maliciousness is wasted.  One can no more imagine this couple trying to carry off a fight on that scale any more than we can imagine Maggie Smith lofting ""Un Bel Di"", or any other aria.  But still, if you're going to fight, fight, don't bicker.  What we end up with is a couple caught on a bad day, and not a particularly notable one at that.

Ah well.  If you've already seen the other two you'll have to see this one.  The first in the trilogy is still the best, and who knows, in fifteen years or so, perhaps they'll find each other when their ties have loosened and their baggage has fallen away, and in nascent old age, realize that there's still something there.  We're not there yet, but I could sit through that one too.  So, while it's not as good as the first time, what is?

Do I care to see the continuation of the lives of Jessie and Celine? Not really.

I watched these movies as they came out. Before Sunrise in the 90s and Before Sunset in the 2000s. These movies have always been more about the pondering of Jessie and Celine than any real progression of their relationship.  I suppose I was expecting more deep insight and intelligent discussion, but this movie isn't about that.  This movie is THE movie about Jessie and Celine. This is about their friends, family, and the complications of their relationship.

Delpy and Hawke's chemistry is still here after all these years, the acting is as good as it's always been, the Grecian backdrop is gorgeous, and the story feels real.

(MINOR SPOILER)

But Jessie and Celine have devolved as people. There is a verbally-intense fight scene that struck me as too mean-spirited. I don't respect these characters any more.  I know people may defend this film as a dose of reality of two imperfect people and I'm not arguing that. Celine's borderline insanity combined with Jessie's guilt-inducing prattling about his son just wore me out.

Make no mistake, this is a movie worth watching. It contains all the brutal elements of relationships and all that it entails. But I don't care about what happens before noon, before brunch, or before anything anymore.

This time, they are an established couple though tellingly, still not married. Jesse indeed left his loveless marriage after the end of ""Before Sunset"", and the lovers are now in their early forties raising twin girls. For the second time, Linklater wrote the script with co-stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, and together they achieve a level of familiarity with their characters' relationship that makes the incidental story resonate in ways quite unexpected. Unlike the first two films, there is no ticking clock manufactured to provide a need for resolution by the end. Instead, the fate of the couple's relationship is entirely in their hands, and now that we have an emotional investment in the characters, that's what makes this entry more compelling.

The movie flows leisurely picking up the particular rhythms of conversations that show how words can become weapons. The story begins at the end of an idyllic Greek vacation where the couple has been staying with friends of various generations. As Jesse puts his now-adolescent son Henry on a plane headed back to Chicago, it becomes clear that his ex-wife didn't take the divorce well and now has full custody of Henry. Jesse shares with Celine his struggle in being so far away from Henry, and they banter about the challenges of parenthood and her indecision around accepting a government job. You would think that the stage they are in their lives would not yield much in the way of romantic sparks, but when they meet their friends for a farewell meal, they return to their familiar selves as they discuss the challenges in making human, much less romantic, connections in the digital age. Their friends decide to treat them to a romantic night at a nearby hotel, and the dialogue comes back to just the two of them. The chemistry between them percolates in a subtle manner as they walk to the hotel stopping to ponder the sunset.

Once at the hotel, the friction begins mildly when the front desk clerk, an effusive fan of Jesse's books, insists Celine autograph her copies. Although she obviously served as his inspiration, she had nothing to do with the writing and bristles at the request. Then a phone call from Chicago sets off tensions that had been simmering between the two about the possibility of moving away from Paris to Chicago. Their verbal combat scene has the brutal honesty and up-and-down rhythms that feel more realistic than most such fights depicted onscreen, and that's what makes the scene more powerful since things said in the most matter-of-fact way sting with inevitable consequences. Looking understandably worn, Hawke and Delpy know their characters and each other's so well they don't need to sketch out a backstory. We've already seen it, and together with Linklater, they've written it and perhaps will continue to shape their future. The director and actors continue to evolve as much as the characters do.

This little event leads to Jesse questioning his decisions in life and leads to trouble in his marriage. In preparation for watching this movie I watched the two previous ones. Before Sunrise was OK but a little slow moving. Before Sunset was better but still nothing amazing. This one is far and away the best of the trilogy and feels the most real. Sunrise is about a chance meeting on a train. Sunset is about reconnecting love after a book tour brings him to the place she is. This one deals with real world issues and finally answers the question of if these two should be together or should they have left it as a one night meeting. I'm sure I'm not the only one to say this but this reminded me of me and my wife and fights we have had. That aspect may have helped me really get into this movie but either way this is the best of the three and I recommend this which is something I can't really say about the other two. Overall, a movie for couples to watch together. Most will see similarities. I liked it. I give it a B+.",1381708800,3,1360,4.275193798449612

The movie consists of mostly dialogue and does not have ridiculously moments consistently found in other romance movies such as the inevitable breakup scene, only to be reunited later. Just smart conversation, and none of the lame cliches and gimmicks.",1381190400,5,328,4.771929824561403
5821090,5,B00DJYJPLO,"I'm a huge movie buff and a major bookworm, but I usually don't write reviews. I think that this series of films from Linklater, Delpy and Hawke are stunning and gorgeous works of art, decidedly major feats across the board: in acting, directing, writing and camerawork. As the third film in the series, Before Midnight stands out the most to me. It reminded me a bit of Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage, with Delpy holding my primary attention the entire length of a movie (not to give Hawke, who was also brilliant, his due credit).

My word of advice, start from the beginning, enjoy these masterpieces.

But...seriously Sony? A movie of this quality really should not look so cheap.",1380844800,5,686,4.756302521008403
5821091,5,B00DJYJPLO,"The Before films never previously dealt with relationships.  Or at least they never dealt with the day in, day out labor of maintaining a relationship over the course of years.  Before Sunrise lovingly details the opening stages of romance, and Before Sunset reignites this relationship while including the added pressures of growing older.  Before Midnight, then, is the first of this series to actually investigate how Jessie and Celine might function as a married couple entering into middle age together.

As its impossibly gorgeous European locale, Before Midnight takes Greece.  Jessie has been invited to a kind of summer writers program at the home of a Grecian author.  Jessie's son from his first marriage, Hank, has spent his summer in Greece with Jessie and Celine.  The film's opening sees Jessie sending Hank back home, and it captures the nice dynamic between an inarticulate early teen and his loquacious father.  Jessie keeps on trying to engage his son in conversation, but Hank doesn't bite, and you start to think that maybe the relationship between the two is strained.  But before passing through security, Hank blurts out that this has been the best summer of his life.  Jessie returns to Celine and their twin blonde headed moppets who are waiting outside the airport, but it is clear that the geographical divide between he and his son weighs on Jessie, a problem that has subtly torn at Celine and Jessie's relationship.

Like the two prior films, Before Midnight could easily have been produced as a stage play.  The film can be divided into at least four distinct parts: the drive home from the airport, the Grecian dinner party, the walk to the hotel, and the confrontation at the hotel.  In each section, the camera maintains long shots that hold for what I would imagine are at least ten minutes at a time.  The drive home appears to be nearly one long shot.  But Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have developed such charisma and so easily inhabit these characters that their back and forth creates a kind of suspense.  We wish to know what each character will say next.

The movie's fulcrum is a playful dinner scene where several generations of diners discuss the possibilities and permutations of relationships.  A twenty-something couple who are clearly infatuated with each other at the same time deny that monogamy is even possible.  A couple, around the same age as Jessie and Celine, clearly takes a cynical view of their relationship and never really take it seriously.  The elderly host, meanwhile, speaks to the necessity of always being two in a relationship, of never fully melding your identity with that of your husband or wife.  In one story that's bandied about, a guest recounts a lengthy autobiography/letter left behind by her grandmother where her husband only takes up a grand total of a few pages.  For this woman, her female friends were the relationships she truly cherished.

The entire film culminates with a confrontation in a hotel room.  As a present, Jessie and Celine were given a hotel room for the night so that they could get away from their two daughters and have a romantic evening.  This eventually results in a truly epic fight.  But on their walk to the hotel, the two engage in the kinds of conversations that we have come to expect from these two.  At the same time it is clear that after nine years, these little tete-a-tete's have become increasingly rare.  After reaching the hotel, their romantic evening is stymied by an argument that begins with an off handed comment Jessie made earlier about wanting to move back to the States in order to be closer to his son, a comment which resulted in a number of subtle and not so subtle jabs by Celine over the course of the day.  But soon the argument veers off in a number of directions, building on nine years of issues left unresolved.

Perhaps the closest cinematic equivalent to the blow up between Celine and Jessie is the Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor drama Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?  But despite the level of anger and the deep wounds Celine and Jessie inflict on one another over the course of this argument, it never quite veers into the bleak cynicism of Wolf.  Burton and Taylor's characters love seemed to manifest only when they were tearing at one another.  It knew no other form.  We know that Celine and Jessie are capable of transcending all of the every day difficulties of life.  Hawke, Delpy, and Linklater also manage to stage the fight in such a way that it veers from raw to humorous.  A combatant might spew an argument ending decree only to come back with an ""And another thing...""  The filmmakers are also careful to take the complaints of disappointments and unmet needs seriously.  Neither character is fully right nor wrong.  When Celine engages in a typical feminist argument that she is burdened with the childcare, we might not fully agree with the degree of her claims.  But at the same time it's clear that Jessie is attempting to position her as the irrational female.  No doubt, there is some truth in Celine's critique that sexism affects their relationship.

Before entering the hotel, Jessie and Celine sit by the Mediterranean watching the sunset.  Jessie narrates the sun's disappearance over some seaside cliffs: ""Still there. Still there. Still there. It's gone.""  The fight in the hotel room is at times so mean spirited, so vicious that it could easily be the end.  Their relationship might one day be there and the next gone.  And like the previous two films, things end somewhat ambiguously.  We are not given full closure on the story of Jessie and Celine, because as an audience, we must leave before their narrative is truly over.  But call me an optimist, because I think these two will stay together long into old age.  Despite it all, they are just too interesting together to break up.

It's hard to overstate what the trio of Hawke, Delpy, and Linklater have accomplished with the Before Trilogy.  Each successive movie only deepens these characters.  And the themes have become more nuanced, more multifaceted with time.  If Before Midnight isn't the most enjoyable of the three movies (and that's not to say it is ever dull), it is perhaps the best of the trilogy.  My guess is that Midnight marks the end of this series, but without a doubt the relationship between Jessie and Celine lives on in the minds of their fans.  The characters seem to live outside of the screen.",1379721600,6,6458,4.800724637681159
5821092,1,B00DJYJPLO,"I love the first two Before films and own both on Dvd,after the abrupt ending of Before Sunset i looked forward to finding out what happens to Celine & Jesse and when i finally did it was very bad. In my opinion this film has none of the elements that made the first two so good and as an overall film it is just depressing (I think a better story for the third film would have been for Celine and Jesse to finally become a couple) but instead it skips ahead to them being in a relationship & having a pair of twin daughters and Jesse feeling guilt for not being able to be the kind of father he would like to be to his son (Who he rarely see's due to him living in the United States while Jesse and Celine live in Paris) and all of the bickering between him and Celine who became a real ball busting bitch,she tears him down every chance she gets in this film,when all he is trying to do is figure out a way to be more involved in his sons life,to be a better father to him,she accuses him of infidelity,she criticizes the way he makes love,she tells him that she doesn't think she is in love with him anymore and what is even worse is that after all of the hateful nasty things she says to him Jesse degrades himself in trying to please her...In ending i will say that this is just a bad film (I don't understand how it received good reviews from the critics or from other reviewers on Amazon)..I hope that this is the final film in the Before series because it ruined what was a Beautiful love story.",1379030400,4,1503,4.1331058020477816

Also a good study of relationships and marriage and how when the years wear on, you can start taking each other for granted once that initial ""magic"" of a new relationship is gone. The acting by everyone in the small cast is great and comes off very naturally, but the best part of the movie for me is the second half which is almost entirely dialogue between Ethan and Julia's characters.  Some great writing, great acting--tense scenes--but ultimately a pleasant ending, that makes me wish there would be a fourth to see what happened next.",1519862400,,806,4.513698630136986

Before Midnight is a pretty damned good character study.  It went to places that I would never have guessed.  The argument in the hotel room was a bit uncomfortable to watch because it was so real.  In fact, I was glad to be watching alone.  Had my wife been there, she would have identified with too many of Julie Delpy's complaints about her husband and married life.  I doubt that Hawke or Delpy will read this, but you both did a fantastic job.  Not just on this movie, but all three.  I sure hope there's a fourth one coming.  And I'm very happy that I recently discovered these movies.  I want to write more details about this film (how certain parts made me feel and what I think the movie means, which is different from what I have seen others write in their reviews), but at the same time, I don't want to give away parts of the film.
