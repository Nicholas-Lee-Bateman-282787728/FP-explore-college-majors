And it was........""Dreaming Out Loud"" was the first of their 7 films and actually getting to see them on screen is a treat to be sure......Francis Langford (later of the Bickerson's fame) does an admirable job as Alice. And the 2nd film, ""The Bashful Bachelor"", guest-starring the late, great ZaSu Pitts, is another winner. Laid-back, country humor at its best.......",1382572800,,538,4.923076923076923
8024236,4,B00029BNHI,"I found this and the Feature #2 companion DVD a reak kick in the old Nostalgia keister. I saw these movies in the theatre when they were first released. That gives you an idea of how old I am. The two movies on #1 were a little scratchy but considering how old they are and what they may have looked like before restoring them, I was very pleased. I have had worse copies of old movies. I can't say if the humor would hold up to most of the last two generations, but for any of us oldtimers, they are worth the price. The same with feature #2.",1127692800,8,543,4.037037037037037
