6531352,5,B00M0JTTU6,"This show is by far the best animated show on TV. It's clever, funny, and best of all, quotable. I imagine this would be fantastic for children, but I'm an adult and still love It. I give this 5 stars because its a Penguins of Madagascar dvd. However, this is not brand new material. It does contain a single previously unreleased episode, which made it worth the money. Episodes are:
Hello, Dollface
A Visit From Uncle Nigel
Snowmageddon (previously unreleased)
Mr. Tux
Hot Ice
Mask of the Raccoon
The Big Move
All Nighter Before Christmas",1415145600,46,540,4.6947368421052635
