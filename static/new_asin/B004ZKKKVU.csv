If you're a college student who's into drinking games, you have a built-in ""drink when they say"" one here.  I have never even heard a regular human being say ""dude"" so many times.

4509870,3,B004ZKKKVU,"After reading fellow reviewers' comments, I had high expectations for SyFy's ROADKILL.  While I concur with many of these comments, I found some of the movie a little clich and repetitious.  Kudos for the unexpected order of slayings and the Irish scenery.
Once again, a group of friends go off on a sightseeing trip and run into a clan of gypsies instead of hillbillies.  After stealing a strange medallion from the head klansman (an excellent Ned Dennehy) they accidentally run over the village oracle who puts a curse on them regarding the fabled simuroc--a big bad hungry bird.
ROADKILL is one of the better films in the ""Maneater"" series.  I admit if I heard ""Dude"" one more time, I might have used the DVD for a frisbee.  Most of the performances are adequate, although Stephen Rea is ill-used in a basically cameo appearance.  The bird effects are decent with only a couple of minor flaws.  Overall, ROADKILL is entertaining; just expected more.",1314921600,,952,4.839506172839506

4509872,4,B004ZKKKVU,"Released to tv in April, 2011, and on dvd August 30th, ""Roadkill"" is yet another creature-on-the-loose flick from Syfy. This time it's a giant bird-of-prey, the mythical Roc, preying upon a bunch of youths touring rural Ireland in an RV, picking 'em off one by one.

With Syfy you never know what you're going to get. For every ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sasquatch-Mountain/dp/B000JYW5UK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sasquatch Mountain</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Within/dp/B001P9N99O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Within</a>"" there's a ""Mega Cleavage Vs. Gatorade."" With a title like ""Roadkill"" the prognosis wasn't very good, but ""Roadkill"" surprised me.

The movie combines elements of several films: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeepers-Creepers-2-Special-Edition/dp/B0000E2R6P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeepers Creepers 2 (Special Edition)</a>"" (flying creature attacking a bus full of youths) and countless other flying creature flicks like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carny-Maneater-Series/dp/B002K0WBVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carny: Maneater Series</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wyvern-Maneater-Series/dp/B00284G2A8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wyvern: Maneater Series</a>,"" as well as films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrong-Turn/dp/B00005JMDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrong Turn</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dying-Breed/dp/B001P9N99E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dying Breed</a>"" (malevolent hicks in remote areas). It also has a subplot about an old gypsy curse, which is reminiscent of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drag-Me-to-Hell-Unrated-Director-s-Cut/dp/B002JT69IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drag Me to Hell (Unrated Director's Cut)</a>."" If you like these types of films ""Roadkill"" is as good or better.

What makes it ""as good or better""? For one, it's filmed on location in mysterious rural areas of Ireland, which sets it apart from most Syfy flicks which are filmed in British Columbia, Romania or Bulgaria. Secondly, it has a likable cast with a good assortment of gorgeous women. Thirdly, the CGI creature is well done, unlike say the cartooney cat in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabretooth/dp/B00008K77J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabretooth</a>."" Fourthly, the material is taken seriously and never devolves into camp or goofiness. Fifthly, this is just a solidly made Grade-B creature feature. The filmmakers obviously took the time to make a quality product and this is seen in numerous scenes. For instance, the sparrow scene (you'll know what I mean when you see it), as well as the touching reflective sequences in-between bird attacks and the many atmospheric forest/moors images. I also like how the film touches on the human breaking point and insanity, which would certainly be a possibility (or probability) if this occurred in real life.

The first review of ""Roadkill"" on IMDb absurdly gives the film the absolute lowest rating possible (1/10), not to mention inexplicably gives away the ending (?!). What a moron.

This reviewer refers to the youths as ""stereotypical beautiful college kids"" but, as far as the dudes go, I don't see any Brad Pitts, and as far as the ladies go, they're pretty hot, as noted above, but not unbelievably so. Also, despite the token minority they seem like a realistic circle of friends.

This reviewer also rags on the film for the huge RV, but this is a pretty big group of youths so the RV HAS to be big enough to accommodate them. Besides, we see huge RVs all over rural areas of North America, why would it be any different in Ireland? It goes without saying, pay this review no mind.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Roadkill"" is a solid low-budget flying creature flick with a sideplot of ee-vil gypsies and is well worth your time if you're into these types of films. It's at least as good as ""Wyvern"" and I like it better than ""Jeepers Creepers 2.""",1312588800,4,4229,6.777163904235727
4509873,5,B004ZKKKVU,"Even the most casual genre viewer knows anytime a group of young people hit the byways for a road trip, it's going to end badly. And if the trip happens to be on the rural roads of a foreign land, you might as well pack body bags along with the beer, condoms and pot.

While the premise of the road trip gone horribly wrong is indeed an overused genre trope, fans shouldn't let that stop them from checking out the Syfy Original Movie Roadkill, which airs this Saturday, April 23, 2011.

Directed by Johannes Roberts and written by Rick Suvalle, this incarnation of the road trip to hell introduces us to five young Americans who decide to hit the back roads of Ireland for a scenic weekend. They haven't seen one another in a while, one of their clan has relocated to Dublin for career purposes, and the group sees it as a chance to reconnect before the grind of adult life begins in earnest. It may also provide an opportunity for estranged lovers to reunite.

They hit the road in a rented RV and take in the picturesque Irish countryside as planned, but it's not long before things take a dark turn when they cross paths with a community of backwoods gypsies. Cultures clash as they always do in these paradigms, and during a hasty getaway the group runs over an old woman with their RV. When they try to help, she uses her last dying breath to place a curse on the shell-shocked clan, telling them the ""Simuroc"" will avenge her and kill them one by one.

Rather than suffer the wrath of the locals who will descend upon them long before authorities can arrive, the group opts to flee the scene, having no clue as to the cycle of events which has now been set in motion.

They soon find out the Simuroc is a giant bird of prey which will stop at nothing to complete its contracted mission of revenge, and it's at this point the pic kicks into high gear as the RV speeds through the countryside with the Roc in hot pursuit.

True to formula, a series of events impedes the group's escape, and just when the script appears to be entering all too familiar territory with a predetermined kill order, writer Rick Suvalle does a nice job of shifting character focus so we're never entirely sure who's going to be the next victim and, more importantly, who's going to survive, if anyone.

Another nice change-up is, too often, the filmmakers of these Syfy Originals rely heavily on the monster of the week, which makes them one-note; thankfully that's not the case here as Suvalle and Roberts take the pressure off their monster by wisely keeping the gypsies a part of the story dynamic. Rather than merely serving as a vehicle by which events are set into motion, the clan gives chase throughout the flick and, at times, is far more frightening than the Simuroc. This is due entirely to the stand-out performance of Ned (Sherlock Holmes) Dennehy as the leader of the gypsy clan. He's genuinely menacing and almost single-handedly raises the level of the film. Stephen (Stuck) Rea is solid in the small role of a local policeman who knows all too well about the Simuroc and its exploits, and Kacey (Resident Evil: Afterlife) Barnfield shows strong acting muscle as ""Kate"", one half of the estranged lovers. The rest of the cast is actually pretty good for a Syfy Original, but Dennehy is sure to leave the biggest impression.

Johannes Roberts handles directing duties effectively and does a lot to cover budget shortcomings. It's hard to make a story which primarily takes place inside an RV visually interesting, and he compensates quite well by making the most of the optics when the plot ventures outside the vehicle. He and Suvalle also steer the pic much darker than the average Syfy feature, which is unusual for a cable network that tends to keep its genre fare campy and ""horror lite"". It's an appreciated shift in tone that sets Roadkill apart from other Syfy entries.

The creature effects are a mixed bag as they tend to be with these things. In this case, the effects bounce between bad CGI and looking like something created by Ray Harryhausen, which almost makes them endearing at times.

All in all Roadkill is a solid entry in the Syfy Original genre. While it suffers from some of the shortcomings we're used to seeing with these films, there are enough pleasant surprises to keep it interesting. The filmmaking is strong overall, and it's clear everyone involved was actually trying to make a good movie here. You never get the sense anyone involved simply showed up for a paycheck, and their dedication shows.

Roadkill is definitely a ride worth taking.

4509885,4,B004ZKKKVU,"""Roadkill"" blends two exploitation genre types: the evil backwater (inbred?) family who'd just as soon eat you as take your money and the flying mythological god-monster out to pick you and your stupid college-age friends off one by one.  It's a daffy but fun mash-up that has a moderate level of gore/ mutilation.

When a group of young college co-eds who are like a duller cast of ""Friends"" rejects take a road trip to nowhere in an RV they come across some lecherous types in a curio shop.  Running afoul of these field folk they end up running over one of them, a wizened old witch woman, who manages to curse them before she spits her last breath.  Meanwhile, one of the group managed to swipe a curio from the gift shop that turns out to be an ancient artifact of protection from a god-monster bird who is in the habit of attacking people in his back country who aren't holding onto the protective talisman.  So it attacks and dismembers the co-eds one by one and it gets help from the RV by it conveniently breaking down out in the middle of nowhere.  (Seriously, RV manufacturers should sue these movies for defamation of product!)  But that's not all; a no good sheriff is out to get something and the funky family that ran the curio shop turns up with shotguns and sneers and takes back their protective artifact, chaining up the remainder of the unlucky co-eds who have survived and serving them up as the beast's supper.

Well, you can guess it doesn't quite work out the way the creepy family wants it too, but neither does it turn out the way you might think.  With an ending that might just surprise a few, ""Roadkill"" flies in under the radar just enough to surprise you with a good and sometimes unexpected time.  And it might make you avoid scoping out hill country backroads.  Who knows what evil lurks back in them thar' trees?",1411862400,,1846,4.513513513513513
4509886,3,B004ZKKKVU,"Wow! Another SY-FY channel movie has found it's way to my film library. Part of the MANEATER COLLECTION SY-FY has created for  broadcasting and transferred to DVD for our continous blood-thirsty viewing at home. These DVDs are usually so reasonably priced by Amazon.com that it's a shame not to purchase them. They may not be multi-million dollar box office wonders, but they are still enjoyable film fodder for a lazy Saturday or Sunday afternoons. This DVD follows the story of a group of young adults that accidentally hit an old gypsy woman because of inattention to his driving by the cliche jackass character (Can anyone say THINNER!). Before she dies she curses them and they find out a giant blood-thirsty bird is out to kill them all and just when you thought it had missed one character before it died in a fire, another (or the same one)  finishes the curse on the (no longer) surviving character.

4509887,3,B004ZKKKVU,"The oddest thing about this movie is how a mythical Middle Eastern creature ended up in Ireland.  Off on vacation, liked the place, and decided to stay?
Otherwise, not the worst creature feature I've ever watched.  The situation was interesting enough; a group of dimwitted friends take a road trip and land in the wrong place, at the wrong time, populated by the wrong sort of people, and end up in trouble thanks to the dumbest member of their bunch.  A curse on their heads, a roc on their tail, and crazy locals given to human sacrifice, not the best holiday ever.
The acting is marginal even from the likes of Stephen Rea (arguable the most well-known actor on the roster).  The dialog is rudimentary.  They didn't even take advantage of the great locale (it was filmed in Ireland, but not a part I'd ever visit!).

4509893,4,B004ZKKKVU,"After so many decades of movies about the dangers of Americans traveling in foreign countries, it's a wonder we still go anywhere outside our own borders.  If we're not being turned into werewolves, we're being put under a gypsy curse and fed to a giant mythological bird.  This is the situation Kate and her friends find themselves in.

Kate has been living and working in Ireland since high school, and her ex-boyfriend has organized a reunion with the old gang, which includes Kate's brother Joel, Chuck and Tommy and Hailey and Anita.  They've rented an RV and are going to spend some time seeing the sights.  At one location, they stop for gas and souvenirs, but the medallion Anita buys from one of the locals isn't the one packed in the box as they leave, so Chuck snatches the real medallion from the gypsy she bought it from.  The gang runs out to the RV and takes off before the locals can give chase, but in doing so they accidentally run over an old gypsy woman in the middle of the road.  With her dying breath, the old woman curses them to be food for the Roc, a giant bird of legend.

The gang tries to laugh off the curse until, one by one as the curse foretold, they each begin to fall victim to the giant maneater as it hunts them down relentlessly across the Irish countryside.  Only the medallion, a stylized rendering of the bird itself, has the power to ward it off.  And the gypsies they took it from want it back.

ROADKILL is part of the Maneater series of movies produced by the SyFy channel and originally shown on television.  The DVD reflects this with frequent fade outs and fade ins where the commercials would have originally been.  But with a budget of $1.6 million, ROADKILL is actually one of the better looking SyFy Originals I've seen.

Screenwriter Rick Suvalle's (Spider-Man TV series as well as V.I.P.) script is full of exposition and repetition (several characters remark ""You scared the crap out of me""), but the structure of the plot is managed well enough there were a few side-streets I didn't expect, so that was a nice break from the norm.

There's nothing remarkable about Johannes Roberts' direction.  He's familiar with the territory in the horror genre, and handles the material well, and included several interesting and unexpected shots (the death of Stephen Rea as the cop was handled well and with just the right touch of humor).  At times it seemed as if Roberts was trying to make a serious movie, and SyFy stepped in on occasion and reminded him the audience expects a certain amount of cheese with their original movies.

The cast, also, is nothing special.  No one stands out as particularly impressive, although Diarmuid Noyes (""The Tudors"") as the always-inappropriate Chuck plays his role perfectly.  Why is it always the cocky showoff of the group who gets the best performance?

I never expect a lot from SyFy originals, but I think ROADKILL was done well enough that, if this is the new standard for these things, it might just be time to re-evaluate their place in my DVD library.  Then again, I love the campy ridiculousness of them anyway, I'm just not used to being impressed with anything in them.  ROADKILL, while not perfect and definitely made for TV, steps out of that SyFy Original shadow and tries to raise the bar, which it does ever so slightly.  ROADKILL's not perfect, but, honestly, it's not that bad, either.",1346284800,,3392,4.652684563758389
4509894,2,B004ZKKKVU,"Part of Syfy's Maneater series, Roadkill (2011) is a monster movie with less than impressive special effects and is also severely lacking in the story department.  For whatever reasons, the screenplay tries very hard to have the characters do and say completely stupid things, that make them as unrealistic and unsympathetic as possible.

A group of old friends meet in Ireland, and head out to tour the countryside in a rented bus.  Stopping at the Wayside Garage, the group enters a small establishment selling souvenirs.  A man named Luca (Ned Dennehy), who resembles a vulture, apparently runs the place.  One of the group becomes interested in buying a pendant that Luca is wearing.  After Luca swindles them, Chuck (Diarmund Noyes) jerks the pendant from his neck, and the group runs and boards the bus for a fast getaway.  Unfortunately with Chuck behind the wheel, the bus hits an old woman, who before dying puts a curse on them.

It doesn't take long for the curse to take effect, as while the bus is stopped, one of the group goes outside, and is pulled into the sky by a Roc, a giant mythical bird.  When the bus develops a flat, in a display of solidarity, the chicken-hearted group sends one person out to change the tire alone.  Predictably, the Roc strikes again, carrying away its second victim into the sky.  Besides facing the threat of the pursing bird, Luca wants his pendant back, and along with his gypsy buddies, is eager to turn the tourists into snacks for the hungry Roc.  Things just get worse, as the clueless tourists bungle their way across the countryside, and their bickering and idiotic conversations get more frequent.

Costs probably limits the creature's screen time to a minimum, and what is seen isn't very impressive, as the CG Roc lacks definition, and appears almost translucent at times.  Kate (Kacey Barnfield) is the only one of the group that has the guts to fight back, as the males in the group are rather short on both balls and brains.  As the one responsible for the curse, Chuck is completely obnoxious, and his limited vocabulary gets tired really fast.  Given an appalling script that has them behave like morons, it's difficult for any of the actors to look good.

Like many Sy Fy Channel productions, Roadkill is rubbish.  Dedicated fans of the Maneater series, might want to catch it on Sy Fy before spending any coin on this disaster.",1317513600,3,2392,4.764563106796117

Frankly, though, how stupid could you be to think that you could steal something from some folks in a quaint little village and not realize it was going to take a lot more than just hopping in your van and driving away? I don't suppose it ever occurred to them that rather than constantly arguing, and even fighting with one another after being attacked by Mr. Giant Dodo Bird, that they had a few good opportunities to get away at those times? And rather than driving down a road which often left them wide open for attack, they stood a better chance getting off the road and going through the woods where the creature couldn't just fly through the trees.

There was the making of an interesting story here but I don't think the filmmakers had thought too much about it and they somehow decided to try to weave in a love angle which really didn't work at all. The building of the story was OK up until about the two-thirds mark where the whole thing just slowed down and lost the plot. Again, someone had decided to try to add more backstory to the characters at this stage but by then it really didn't matter and just brought the whole thing off the boil. It was all wrapped up reasonably well in the end.
