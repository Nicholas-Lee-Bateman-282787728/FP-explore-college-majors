8528864,5,B008LXGSFY,I was impressed by this DVD. It's short but straight to the point. It's what they teach in the film making course here at the College. If you stick closely to these guidelines it should improve performance on any set. I've been with a College group for a while and when they get lax on these guidelines the shoots last twice as long as they should.,1372464000,,348,4.287878787878788
