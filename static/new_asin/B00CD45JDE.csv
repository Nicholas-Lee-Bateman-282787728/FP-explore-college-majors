5715874,1,B00CD45JDE,"We really enjoy watching series like Bonanza, Rifle Man, Gunsmoke, etc.  Excited to receive another series on Bonanza and have been disappointed in the 6th season.  On disk one and two of the package the shows either didn't play (like they were not recorded on the DVD at all) or the episode title showed one but the actual episode that played was a previous episode.  This problem only existed on disk 1 & 2 so the rest of the season was fine.  We returned our first set and the same thing happened on our third set.  So we are going to try one more time to see if we get lucky.  Not holding my breath.  If you don't mind having about 5 episodes being lost then you might not mind getting this season.  Good Luck!",1456963200,2,714,4.237037037037037

5715881,5,B00CD45JDE,"The final season with Pernell Roberts.  A wonderful old series that looks better today than it did when it was first broadcast. The amazing part is that this series holds up so well.  Many older series that I watched as a kid aren't nearly as good as they were 40 years ago, but not so with Bonanza.  Still a great show.  The acting is as good as anything today but the wonderful family values are perfect.  A show that still holds up very well.",1426636800,,445,4.25

Volume one will consist of four disks while volume two will have five disks, combining for a total of 33 shows. This season includes the series first two-part episode, which was later released as a theatrical feature, and will be included as an extra with this set. The ""SRP"" has yet to be announced. Thank you Paramount-CBS Home Entertainment for this release and continuing the ""Cartwright"" saga on DVD. I can't wait to pre-order the two pack ""bundle"" edition (vol. one & two together) from Amazon (better sooner than later please). Have fun !!!

5715907,5,B00CD45JDE,I grew up watching Bonanza and I have always loved it.  It's wonderful being able to watch these shows anytime during the day or night.  It's also interesting to find out how much has been edited out of the shows we get to watch on TV these days.,1397520000,,246,4.104166666666667
5715908,5,B00CD45JDE,"I'd rather they take the time to keep the quality up. These as well as other CBS DVD's from the 60's and 70's look excellent, even without hi-def, other shows to check out? Mannix, Mission Impossible, Gunsmoke and Hawaii Five O all look better than they did when originally broadcast!

Besides, when they release them every few months it builds up a demand for them. New press releases spark new interest and also a lot of people might not be able to afford to buy the complete set at once! Too many great series with low sales have left me in the lurch by not releasing the rest of the series (Early Edition, St Elsewhere, WKRP and others to name a few)! I was too young to catch a lot of these shows. I'm playing catch up now and enjoying every minute of it!",1395619200,4,760,4.277777777777778
5715909,5,B00CD45JDE,"What is the reason for the slow release?  If it is to remaster them, I would accept that.  This is a very popular series and Bonanza fans are waiting for the rest of them.  At least release 2 seasons per year (3 is preferrable).",1395100800,,228,4.136363636363637

5715911,5,B00CD45JDE,"I have bought all of these sets and we are waiting for the rest of the series.  Michael Landon is my favorite actor and he did a lot of directing and writing in the later seasons. He did the episode called THE WISH...which is what got him the job doing Little House ON The Prairie.  Bonanza is one of the greatest shows of all time and we a top rated show even after PERNELL ROBERTS left....he was my least favorite of the bunch anyway, so I dont' really care about all that.  ;) Buy this set as if you don't...we will not see anymore.  It has been reported that the sell of Season 6 has been low and we really want to see more CBS.  Please!!! Give us Season 7 and 8 this year...and maybe even 9 and 10.  Please...Buy these guys!

I have purchased other Bonanza DVD's in the past and have been very disappointed with the picture and sound quality. One set came in a nice attractive tin metal box. The DVD's were useless.

5715936,5,B00CD45JDE,"Another awesome and entertaining season by my all-time favorite western tv series. I'm so proud to own these Official DVD sets.
The only thing that's sad about this season is knowing that it's the final season with Adam (Pernell Roberts). He left after this season to pursue other things. But Adam was great clear to the end. As are all of the Cartwrights.

These DVD sets aren't the quickly rushed type that most companies release of different tv shows. These are all digitally restored, with beautiful picture quality and sound. In fact, they look better than they did when they originally aired. I often find myself forgetting just how old this series is when I'm watching it. It's easy to fool myself into thinking it's a current series. The wonderful clarity causes that. Hard to believe that something that was filmed so long ago can look SO good.

There's a bunch of extras on these DVD's. Such as photo galleries, Chevrolet adverts/promos, original NBC logo and bumpers, and commentary on select episodes. There's even some extras with Lorne Greene and Michael Landon singing. VERY interesting. I love the fact that Columbia Pictures isn't lazy with these DVD releases. They pack as much content as they can into these sets (unlike other DVD sets of tv shows, such as Family Matters. Which has no extras whatsoever.) They're VERY worth owning in your collection. Definitely worth the 5-Star rating I gave it.

I only hope they continue releasing these Official Season Sets until all 14 seasons are on DVD.",1376611200,16,1513,4.879377431906615
5715937,5,B00CD45JDE,"There's more than just the episodes of Bonanza here. There are also several rare and vintage promo advertisments for Chevrolet cars and trucks . Furthermore, this set also includes the new for 65 ad with stars from Bewitched .(who also used Chevrolets in their show).  If you belong to a Chevrolet club or just like Chevies in general, I think you will find not only the show entertaining but these rare ads as well.",1376524800,8,416,4.621621621621622

There are clips of the actors appearing on other television shows, singing and in comedy skits.  Can't wait for the next season to be released.",1376352000,2,291,4.76
5715939,4,B00CD45JDE,"I thought that it was good, but then again, I'm NOT a Super BIG Fan of this Show like my Sister.  Now if someone were to ask her what she thinks of it, she would say that she Loves it, and she Can't wait until the Next Season Comes Out onto DVD.  Now, I'm NOT a Fan like she is, but I still like this Western Television Show.  For ANY and ALL BONANZA Fans, I would Strongly / Highly Recommend that you get this; if your someone like me, then I still say "" Go For It ""!",1376179200,,468,3.7551020408163267

5715945,5,B00CD45JDE,"Bonanza's 6th season was the last to feature Pernell Roberts as Adam Cartwright.  Unhappy with a perceived decline in script quality, Roberts would leave in early 1965 (mid-season) to pursue other acting opportunities.  Because of this, just under half of the episodes featured in this collection are ""Adamless""; which tees up the ""three Cartwright era"" that would showcase Lorne Greene, Michael Landon & Dan Blocker exclusively, until David Canary joined the cast in the fall of 1967.

This is also the season in which the original distributor, Republic Pictures, began dividing up seasons for syndication.  ""Lothario Larkin"", which was one of the ""Adamless"" 6th season episodes, was excluded from Bonanza's ""Classic 260"" syndication package that has aired on North American television from the late 1970's to date.  It remained out of syndication until it was included as part of the ""Lost Episodes"" package that began airing on the Family Channel back in 1988.  Inexplicably, it's the only pre-7th season episode excluded from that original package. The 8th, 9th, 10th & 11th season episodes were divided between ""Classic 360"" and ""Lost Episodes"" packages, so it will be exciting to see them all together again in their original running order in future Bonanza releases.

In this set, we have a refreshing blast from the past.  I've never seen these episodes look so clean!  I grew up watching those washed out, grainy 16mm syndication prints on KTLA in Los Angeles. So seeing the color and audio restored to near-HD quality is a real treat; along with all the extras.  I'm guessing these episodes didn't look this great when they aired on NBC back in the day!

Keep it up!",1373328000,33,1676,5.036231884057971
