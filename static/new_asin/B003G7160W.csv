My pulse rate definitely goes up when watching.  I don't know if this is considered a reality show or not, but its very exciting.

4120985,5,B003G7160W,"Wana watch some very good action being presented in HD!? Rent it for 1.99 and it's well worth it. I have rented most if not all of the shows presented here.

4120989,5,B003G7160W,"If you have not seen these programs on TV, do not miss them on DVD.  They are outstanding and enlighten the viewer on the complicated and dangerous fixes that our modern world requires.  Ships, airplanes, wind generators, power lines, dams, bridges, and many other huge fixes are presented in the programs.  I really became aware of what it takes to keep our modern highly industrialize society operating.  The fascinating programs give the viewer an actual hands on feel for the various fixes.",1318723200,2,494,4.987804878048781
4120990,2,B003G7160W,"The producers have managed to make what could be a great show, into a mediocre yawn-fest. The self-serving host, Sean Riley comes across like a narcissistic douche! He inserts himself into every situation, calls it a tight spot, then takes credit for coming to the rescue. Watch the reactions from the actual workers, particularly when they say ""thanks for your help, we couldn't have done it without you"" -- you can tell he did practically nothing, and was just in the way.",1298592000,2,474,4.7926829268292686

8396363,5,B003G7160W,"Very well done, a bit too much repetition and hype. The camera work was fantastic, it was very engaging and very informative. Not too much swagger or hyperbole. I'd watch some other episodes now.",1462233600,,195,4.764705882352941
