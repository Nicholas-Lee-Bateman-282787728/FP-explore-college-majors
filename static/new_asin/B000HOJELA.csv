2639471,5,B000HOJELA,"This film is a virtual dicotomy of two men in love.  It portrays the likeness and intensity in the budding, building and final completion in this dicotomy of men's love.  This shows the power of love, no matter the circumstances.  This film ends in a Greek Tragedy where the physical union is broken, but the spiritual union remains forever.  LOVE IS BUT A UNIVERSAL CONSTANT FOR MANKIND!  NJMJr
PS lf you want to see the real and honest power of true love, this is the film to watch.  If you are already a tried and true hypocrite of the Christian faith then ignore this review as you will probably just rely the absurdity of such a medieval faith in a modern culture of today's world!!

2639472,1,B000HOJELA,"The human elements of this movie are quite touching, but it contains the most appalling incidents of animal abuse I have ever seen. At least one very sweet dog and one rabbit are killed on camera for the enjoyment of the director and his audience. Other viewers clearly don't care, but I do.

However inspiring this movie might have been otherwise, I strongly advise anyone who really cares about animals not to watch it. If you're the sort who can excuse animal abuse in the name of art or changing times (as others have done here), or if, like the director, you actually enjoy it, then by all means indulge yourself. But if, like me, you believe that animal abuse for entertainment was no less abominable and inexcusable 30 years ago (or 1000 years ago) than it is now, you should avoid this movie.",1264291200,14,800,4.555555555555555
2639473,3,B000HOJELA,"Just okay, I have no intention of watching it a second time.

It presents some interesting issues such as gay love, mental illness, country-life, woman as sex objects to be used as one likes, not much respect for life.

I will never spoil the movie with specifics, but why the film makers decided to use the character of a recluse nutjob, escapes me.  Some of the film was thought-provoking, like maybe not all humans at war on opposite sides are really enemies, depends on their actions.

What is this switch that is flicked when countries are at war with each other - it's okay to kill each other when ""at war"".  It made me think about religious and moral values regarding killing in peace time versus war time.  These are not easy issues to reconcile if you truly have a serious debate because good arguments can be brought forward for both sides of the issue.  I guess it made me think that there are wars/conflicts which I can more easily defend philosophically than others, but it's a shame that we have to kill each other to settle these disputes.  I mean, too bad that so many have to die all because of a madman or a few poliicians.

Anyway, it has its' merits so I rate 3 stars.",1262131200,2,1188,4.412844036697248
2639474,5,B000HOJELA,"Finally!  I saw this film at a New York Gay Film Festival in the 80's, and have held on to my VHS copy in the hopes of its being relased on DVD one day.  The movie is acted with more than passionate intensity by the two principals (neither originally French: a blond Russian and a dark Armenian).  And even though we nowadays condemn the ending as politically incorrect, it is within context, the French young man being mentally unbalanced and quite naive at the same time.  In fact, it does point to the theme of resurrection according to natural laws: sprouting.  The fact that it will not happen does not detract from its validity.",1260057600,11,634,4.526315789473684

2639476,5,B000HOJELA,"Philippe Valois is one of France's earliest and best gay directors.  I first saw this film at a NY Gay Film Festival, bought the VHS and when I switched to DVD format, gave away the tape, thinking I could replace it in the new format.  No such luck.  It never made it into DVD, as so many other great European and Latin American gay movies (A un dios desconocido, Ernesto, The Flavor of Corn, Otra historia de amor).

The story is simple and utterly beautiful.  A mentally challenged young Frenchman of extraordinary physical strength, played by Serge AVedikian, is afraid of the Germans because he has heard they exterminate the handicapped.  Therefore, he lives by himself in the woods.  One day, he captures a beautiful German flyer--Piotr Stanislas-- tends his wounds and turns him into his pet.  However, little by little they fall in love.  With the approach of the end of the war, the German must flee.  When he tries to, the Frenchman shoots him and then, in an unexplicable move, opens a grave, deposits the body and jumps in as well, closing the hole with a straw mat.  It took me several viewings to understand this last scene, which has to do with what the Frenchmen did to little animals his dog caught and killed.  He ""planted"" them as if they were seeds, so they would ""sprout"" again.

I usually shy away from gay movies with unhappy endings, but this film has stayed with me for over 20 years, and I still consider it a masterpiece of the genre.  Time to replace my missing tape!",1247875200,15,1495,4.550561797752809

(France, 1980) Directed by: Philipe Vallois. Color. Running Time: 90 Minutes. Contains Nudity & Mature Sexual Themes. Unrated. In French with English subtitles.

During the final days of World War II, a simple French peasant rescues a wounded German soldier and nurses him back to health. And as their playful camaraderie grows, two young men who should be enemies begin to bond in ways neither thought possible.

2639478,2,B000HOJELA,"I lost interest after about 1 hour, and didn't finish the film.

This film was first released in France in 1979.  It must have been an independent film, because the production values are quite poor.  Compared to the Hollywood film ""Making Love""(1982), this film really does look like it was filmed decades earlier.  They must have had a hard time finding actors to play these roles, because the acting (and the direction as well) leaves a lot to be desired.

The film has many scenes that seem to be for the purpose of portraying the characters as youthful and masculine, or perhaps one might even say ""straight acting"".  There are scenes of straight sex, fights, boyish horsing around, blustery bravado, drunken carousing, all of which we have seen in zillions of films.  Unfortunately, these actors are way too old to come across as youthful, and so much time is spent developing the characters' masculinity that we learn little else about them.  This all leaves the finished product feeling odd and, frankly, unbelievable.

Some reviewers have indicated this is an early example of european gay film making.  Maybe so, but IMHO, ""Der Westler""(1985) is so much better there is no comparison.",1473206400,,1193,4.92

2639513,4,B000HOJELA,"The movie was odd - now odd is not always bad -  the set up was interesting and during the World War II.  A man found a soldier and nursed him back to health.  Their friendship and admiration for each other grew over time.  There was a bit of a love triangle at one point, but our German Soldier realizes that his affections are not for the woman in the movie.  The scene when both men realize they care for each other in a deeper way, I thought, was quite hot.  That could have been because of the mounting sexual tension that began about half way through.  There were also some very tense moments at the end.  The end, to me was a surprise.  I gave it 4 stars because you can't give 3.5 - I am not sorry I watched it - but I believe it is a one time view.

2639519,2,B000HOJELA,"I haven't figured it out yet but there is some underlying message in this deeply disturbing film.  Some point that makes the story cohesive and the climax and denouement mean something.  There is too much talent in the actors and film makers to believe in the nihilism and madness of the film's ending.  There is more than a little of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" in this story; the endings of both movies reflect one another in some twisted and most depressing actions.  Patrick Ford's ""A Single Man"" is also similar...life as a continuous existential torture chamber.  I just don't know.  Not yet anyway.",1440720000,4,598,4.871287128712871

TURNS OUT the movie is a complete piece of garbage. Not only are the subtitles often absent (leading to plenty of ""wait what did he say?"" moments), but even the parts I did understand made no sense. I often found myself asking ""why did that happen?"" Over and over the creators left things to implication, but oh my god, WHAT IS BEING IMPLIED?? That only lunatics and nazis are gay?

The breaking point came when Ajax, the nazi's dog, was murdered by the lunatic frenchman. I shut the movie off, took it out of the VHS player and my friend and I smashed the tape and burned it.

8140635,1,B000HOJELA,"Just finished watching ""We Were One Man"" released by Water Bearer Films.
I remember first learning about ""We Were One Man"" through an ad and a review in the Washington Post back in 1980.  I remember the basic premise of ""We Were One Man"" was supposed to be a love story between a simple French farmer and the wounded NAZI soldier he discovers in the woods near his farm one day.
As I watched ""We Were One Man,"" nearly 40 years after it's initial release in movie theaters in the United States, I was reminded of the idiom - be careful of what you read, for not everything is true.
Yes, the basic premise was true, Guy, the farmer, discovers a wounded Rolf and nurses him back to health..
Yet, how ""We Were One Man"" ever won a Silver Hugo award at the Chicago Film Festival in 1980 is beyond me.  This so-called masterpiece, which was written and directed by Phillip Vallois has all the charm of a badly filmed and written student art film.
Spoiler Alert - there is some rather graphic scenes in this movie which feature animal mutilation.
MAJOR SPOILER ALERT: Its revealed that Guy is mentally ill; and how this movie ends is going to disturb a lot of people who are expecting a really great love story here.  Guy shots Rolf dead in order to protect him from Remittance Fighters who want to question then kill him.  Guy than carries Rolf away, and buries him and himself in an unmarked grave.
Romeo and Romeo this movie ain't folks.
How it has a following of any kind, cult or otherwise is beyond me - unless you really like bad 20th Century French movies.
NOT RECOMMENDED!
ZERO STARS!",1476144000,,1585,4.436426116838488
