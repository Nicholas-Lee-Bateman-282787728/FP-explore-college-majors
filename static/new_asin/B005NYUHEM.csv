8594395,5,B005NYUHEM,"THIS IS THE FIRST SEASON SET OF COLUMBO THAT CONTAINS 9 EPISODES WHICH ARE AMONGST THE MOST POPULAR BY MOST COLUMBO FANS AND ALSO THE MOST EPISODES IN ONE SOLID SEASON, SO THIS SET IS VERY DESIREABLE. AND I THINK ANY COLUMBO FAN WOULD LOVE IT. THIS SET CONTAINS THE MOST POPULAR EPISODE ""MURDER BY THE BOOK"" WHICH WAS WRITTEN/DIRECTED BY STEVEN SPIELBERG, AND STILL TO THIS DAY GETS THE MOST VOTES FOR THE FAN FAVORITES EPISODE. THE FIRST TWO EPISODES WERE CONSIDERED THE 'PILOT' EPISODES TO SEE HOW THE SHOW WOULD TAKE OFF, AND IT DEFINITELY DID! COLUMBO'S CHARACTER WAS NOTABLY MORE NEAT & CLEAN, AND ORGANIZED IN THE FIRST 2 EPISODES, AND THEN AS THE FIRST SEASON PLAYED OUT THE TRUE CLUMSY, RUMPLED, DISORGANIZED COLUMBO'S CHARACTURE CAME TO LIFE ON SCREEN AND CREATED A LEGEND. NOTED GUEST STARS FOR THE FIRST SEASON INCLUDE: JACK CASSIDY, MARTIN MILNER, RODDY McDOWELL, IDA LUPINO, EDDIE ALBERT, SUSANNE PLESHETT, LESLIE NEILSEN, PAT CROWLEY, LEE GRANT, AND COLUMBO REGULAR VILLAIN: ROBERT CULP.",1341360000,,1001,4.928994082840236
