8183647,4,B000O7864Q,"Very entertaining, often funny biography of the amazing Melvin Van
Peebles, whose life includes writing successful novels in French,
directing hit, uncompromised black films at a time when no one else
was, directing Broadway musicals, and even a turn as a stock trader.

A wild, likable, if hard to figure out man, part genius, part showman
and a touch of a con-artist, he seems (at least in this documentary) to
have mellowed over the years.

Not quite a great film, it's not in-depth enough, and is too openly
enamored and unquestioning of it's subject, but a fun and historically
interesting one.  I'll re-visit it.",1293667200,,618,4.923076923076923
8183648,5,B000O7864Q,"I was a bit skeptical when I saw the title, but it's classic Melvin and leave it to the French to tell his story best. It's life come full circle. They helped America see him for the ""first"" time years ago. I most love Melvin's words (might not get it verbatim) in here: make sure when you win, The Man wins. The most conciliatory I've ever seen in him. Don't get it twisted tho'. The man is still baaaaaad. We love you, Mel!!!",1275350400,3,427,4.156626506024097
