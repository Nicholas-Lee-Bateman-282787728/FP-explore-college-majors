8323900,5,B0002VKZJS,"Very good DVD series of what Ive seen so far.  Comes with 5 episodes per disc which makes it worth the money usually.  Action is good, and the characters are cool.  Id recommend this series to anyone.  I love it being in widescreen and having 5.1 surround.  Makes the experience all that much better if you are into high detail/end anatmation, and sound systems like I am.",1098403200,2,372,4.492537313432836
