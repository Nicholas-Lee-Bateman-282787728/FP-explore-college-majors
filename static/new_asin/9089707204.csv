1172898,4,9089707204,This was much better than another DVD I ordered.  The sounds were more realistic and the repeated cycles were easier to overlook.  It was a perfect 3.0 mph walking speed and the sound of waves and peaceful setting were very good.,1392336000,15,229,4.560975609756097
1172899,2,9089707204,"Unfortunately what I experienced with this DVD was a loud buzzing which basically drowned out the lapping of the waves.  Also,  the scenes were repetitive, not progressive, so you didn't feel like you went anywhere, you just ran the same area over and over.",1391558400,4,257,4.818181818181818
1172900,4,9089707204,This one is the same as the other i bought. i like the scenery. i don't like that it is just walking. i should have read the reviews better,1389225600,,139,3.8275862068965516

1172903,5,9089707204,This was my first virtual walk dvd.  It is so perfect that it feels like I am actually getting my feet wet.  I have already ordered more...,1384819200,,139,4.111111111111111
1172904,5,9089707204,"If you like the beach you will love this DVD. I use it with my Treadmill and Eliptical machine and it works very well with them. There is three walks on this with different beaches. Walk One is on Nacpan beach, on this walk you will see a few people out with their dogs. The view is beautiful with Hills and Trees and the clouds floating by. As you walk the ocean is always in view, and your walking in the water, so you can almost feel the water on your toes and can smell the salt water. Walk Two is on Cadiao beach you will see birds, coconut palm trees,hear crickets. It seems as though this is in the evening time with low tide. You will see a few people along the way. some in the water. Along the shore you will see different colored boats. You will still be walking in the water and seeing the ocean the whole time. Walk Three you will see views of the El Nidos Islands. You will see Mangroves,Palm trees and see and hear the birds singing. At some points you walk alittle deeper in the water to go under over hanging trees, which I enjoyed. This beach has a complete different feel to it, the waves seems alittle louder and harder and you feel like you are the only person around. The view is very nice on this one as well. As you walk everything starts to have a orange glow as sunset starts. Then suddenly as you walk you see the sun setting over the ocean, you hear the crickets and it is so beautiful that you want to stay all night. Through this whole DVD you are walking in the water and its like you can feel the water lapping your toes and that you are there. You can't go wrong with this walk. It would also make a great DVD to just sit and enjoy.",1383523200,7,1665,4.09480122324159
1172905,5,9089707204,"Another excellent video from the folks at Virtual Walks---this time at the water's edge. The ocean on your left, palm trees on the right, and a vast, clean beach in front of you that all your's. I would say this is a ""treadmill"" DVD; it's hard for me to imagine riding a bike through the water lapping at my feet. The pace is for walking, as well. What makes it so wonderful is the sight and sound of the blue Pacific washing gently right up to you. You are walking at the high tide mark, at the edge of the wet sand. There's something hypnotic--and mind-clearing--about the sound of the waves. All my problems seem washed away by the action of the gentle surf. So I get a workout and a meditative experience at the same time!

1172906,5,9089707204,These are spectacular videos that really make you feel like you're right there walking on these beautiful beaches! I watch them on my iPad while walking on my treadmill and the time just flies by. I highly recommend them!!!,1381017600,4,223,4.743589743589744

1172913,5,9089707204,"If you like virtual walking on beautiful beaches on a sunny day with no people around, this DVD is for you. Similar to Virtual Walks-Tropical Beaches, this is also shot in HD with different beaches than seen in the Tropical Beaches DVD.

The flaws I could see on this DVD is on the third walk near the end at sunset, you can hear the crew talking among each other a bit which should have been edited out. It also seems to me the Virtual Walks-Tropical Beaches appears at higher definition than this one.

Still, this Virtual Walk DVD is well worth the money along with Tropical Beaches. .",1423267200,,588,4.435185185185185
1172914,5,9089707204,Really enjoy walking along the beach with this beautiful scenery.  Walking on a treadmill can get old fast this helps to keep you moving.  Really enjoy it.,1422403200,,155,4.703703703703703

1172921,4,9089707204,"Great job.  I enjoy the mid-day walks.  I feel that the pace of this one is great for a beginner as well as intermediate.  Also, it is nice to have it in sections in order to choose the walks and not start-over for the whole program.  I enjoy the scenery and would love a few breaks to view the panorama.  I will order more from this group.",1405209600,,340,4.014925373134329

1172923,5,9089707204,"I am a woman in her mid 50's who hates and never does exercise in any way, shape or form.  The doctor diagnosed me with some health issues that are not to be taken lightly.  I knew I had to change some things and not exercising is one of them.  So, I started to walk on an elliptical machine every day.  At first, 5 minutes about killed me. : )  I finally got up to 20 minutes but quit because of the boredom.  BUT, with this DVD, I walked over 30 minutes before I even realized that I had.  The walk loops so it never ends until you stop it which I love immensely.  It is a beautiful, peaceful, relaxing ""walk"".",1398470400,10,612,4.0

1172925,5,9089707204,"I don't like walking on a treadmill, but in the winter with deep snow -- a treadmill is a must.  Treadmills are MONOTONOUS because there is no change of scenery like walking outside.  However, when I use this DVD the time seems to go by fast.  I have a large LED TV in front of the treadmill and with a bit of imagination you can pretend you are walking on the beach.",1398297600,,367,4.069444444444445

7901451,5,9089707204,"This DVD is like a little vacation. It shows a few of the greatest beaches of the Philippines. In your walks, which lead along the water and which make you thing like you're getting wet feet, you occasionally meet other walkers. However often the beaches are deserted and you only see palm trees, water and the bright yellow beach. Some uprooted palm trees lie on the beach or stand in the way, so you have the feeling of having to sidestep. This is very realistic. With its speed, this DVD is very suitable for walking, but you can also only view it to just relax. The sea noises also have a very calming effect.",1442534400,,613,4.385964912280702
