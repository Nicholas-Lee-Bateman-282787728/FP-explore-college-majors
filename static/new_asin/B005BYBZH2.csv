4649493,5,B005BYBZH2,"Seven episodes from the 1980 animated series.  With the previous BCI dvds being out of print & a bit costly, this is good purchase.  Filmation did the Lone Ranger & Tonto justice.
 Episode 1: ""The Runaway""
 Episode 2: ""Hanga the Night Monster""
 Episode 3: ""Yellowstone Conspiracy""
 Episode 4: ""The President Plot""
 Episode 5: ""The Great Balloon Race""
 Episode 6: ""The Escape""
 Episode 7: ""The Valley of Gold""",1319846400,24,408,4.970149253731344
4649515,5,B005BYBZH2,"Once again, I am trying to collect all of my Saturday morning cartoons, and this is one of them. The Lone Ranger was a short-lived cartoon , but it is good, and I like it.",1428105600,4,171,3.914285714285714
4649516,5,B005BYBZH2,Not exactly what I expected as there was an earlier animated Lone Ranger but interesting. Imagine William Conrad as the masked man. He goes by the name of J Darnoc here.,1424131200,2,169,4.483870967741935
4649517,4,B005BYBZH2,Good.,1423872000,,5,5.0
4649518,5,B005BYBZH2,This was a well done Lone Ranger cartoon series. The shorts were believable and the history quip at the end of each story was great. I never saw this when it first aired.  I didn't even know that there was an animated Lone Ranger series. Great animation and storylines. Never boring.,1423353600,5,283,4.549019607843137
4649519,5,B005BYBZH2,great old cartoon,1420934400,2,17,5.0
4649520,5,B005BYBZH2,My 2yo really likes this.  He stays captivated the whole time-which is weird.  It's the old school cartoon..,1416268800,,108,4.944444444444445
4649521,5,B005BYBZH2,My 4-year-old love it and stays glued to the stories until they're over.,1407888000,,72,4.615384615384615
4649522,5,B005BYBZH2,"Big fan of The Lone Ranger! I remember this series as a kid, I had to have this, for my collection! Great quality DVD, good price!",1403049600,3,130,4.038461538461538
4649523,5,B005BYBZH2,"I fully admit to buying this because my version of a meltdown about getting older is not to buy a faster car and cheat on my wife. Nope. It's to snuggle up with my wife and force her to relieve MY ""thrilling days of yester-year"" by watching cartoons and movies that I adored as a kid. No matter how bad they are.",1394323200,14,312,4.048387096774194
4649524,5,B005BYBZH2,Three year old loves it. He has been watching it all day and riding his bouncy horse. Wearing his Lone Ranger mask and hat.,1392336000,,123,4.166666666666667
4649545,5,B005BYBZH2,"My son just turned seven at Christmas and loves The Lone Ranger.  We're not big television watchers in our home, and I am very careful about what my son sees.  I found this to be much more appropriate for a young boy than the PG-13 Disney movie.  He really enjoyed watching this cartoon series, and then spent hours upon hours acting it all out with his new Lego Lone Ranger sets.  When 20-30 minutes of watching a cartoon sparks two hours of imaginative play with his toys, I am a very happy mom.",1390089600,3,497,4.311827956989247
4649546,3,B005BYBZH2,"The animation is what you would expect from this era, unfortunately. Very stiff, a LOT of recycled motions/actions. The plots are a little slow and convoluted, but my 3-year-old still loves it, so it did it's job.",1389830400,2,213,4.783783783783784
4649547,2,B005BYBZH2,"Bought for 6 year old grandson who is into the Lone Ranger Lego series.  This movie did not captivate his attention...possibly because of its lack of flow.  He sat through one episode, and wanted no more.  I felt the same way as his adult aged grandfather who grew up loving the Lone Ranger.",1389225600,,291,4.452830188679245
4649548,3,B005BYBZH2,"Far better than the recent Verbinski version.  This cartoon gets the spirit of the Lone Ranger and treats his legend appropriately.  Not for all tastes, but pretty good for the young 'uns.",1374624000,,188,4.84375
4649549,5,B005BYBZH2,Another great produced by Filmation studios back in early 80s. I especially remembered and loved the orchestral theme song. So dramatic. A great buy as you anxiously await the theatrical release of new Walt Disney film with Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp.,1371254400,4,253,5.0476190476190474
4649550,5,B005BYBZH2,i love cartoons know a days and kids today are missing out because this cartoon could stack up against todays cartoons.,1364342400,,119,4.714285714285714

4649553,5,B005BYBZH2,"Another animated gem. The Lone Ranger is another one of my all-tme favorite westerns, along with Zorro. This dvd is great and would like to get The New Adventures of The Lone Ranger and Zorro Vol. 2 new, if price is reasonable,(different dvd from this one).",1341705600,3,257,4.608695652173913
4649554,5,B005BYBZH2,"My son LOVES horses.  We had shown him some old Lone Ranger black and white shows, but they didn't really keep his attention.  I was thrilled when I found this video.  The video is several episodes of a cartoon version of the old Lone Ranger show.  All the cast of characters are present and the famous theme song.  If you have kids who love horses and cowboys, they will LOVE this video!",1322438400,2,388,4.333333333333333

8464535,4,B005BYBZH2,"At last, the good copy of the last show I used to watch, but the copyright date is only when Golden Books got it from those investers who bought Filmway's collection in the early '90s. Still good after all these years!",1448928000,,218,4.341463414634147
