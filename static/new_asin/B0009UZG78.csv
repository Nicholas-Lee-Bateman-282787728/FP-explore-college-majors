2322238,5,B0009UZG78,"I already have the 3 series of The Vicar of Dibley, which I absolutely love. As a Brit, now living in the USA I remember when the series was on TV, loved it then and still love it now.

I have been studying at school here in America and got some of my friends into The Vicar of Dibley, ironically when I went home last Christmas to visit family, there it was again NEW EPISODES on TV - I was so excited, when I got back I hoped above all hopes that the Beeb would release them over here - and they have - YAY!!!

I will admit these two are not quite as good as the first three series but they are still very very good. The choclate fountain is fantastic!! (a little teaser there for you!!)

I have ordered this 10th Anniversary edition, I can't wait for it to come - neither can my friends, who i got hooked on Dibley!

Buy It - Enjoy It!!",1124841600,6,839,3.9761904761904763
2322239,5,B0009UZG78,"The BBC-DVD Company here in the United States have done it again! They are releasing more episodes of more ""Brit-coms"" then ever before, and I must say that I am extremely happy that ""The Vicar of Dibley"" wasn't forgotten! The first time I was truly amazed with the BBC America DVDs had to have been when they so graciously offered up more ""French and Saunders"" DVDs after such a long break, that most thought they had seen the last of their old gal pals. Here is the second occurence! I must say it was quite a shock when they originally aired these episodes after 10 years of nothing, but my excitement was cut short by the fact that they might never see the light here in America. Yet, here stands the DVD. My only other hope from the company would be for them to release the latest Christmas Special of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" as well(hopefully that won't be the final episode of the series; even if it's going down hill, make another series of ""good"" episodes and we'll be fine)and now with this ""Vicar"" DVD Special, I can only hope ""Ab Fab"" will follow suit.

2322296,5,B0009UZG78,"Classic BBC humor, highly reminiscent of the Saturday Night Live stand up comedy of the 1970's....In typical BBC Comedy fashion, the series starts like a cat waking up....stretching slowly, moving a bit faster, then pouncing on tidbits (of comedy in this case)...You have to watch several episodes and then you will be hooked.  U.S. comedy is geared toward the ""immediate satisfaction"" crowd for the most part - the bulk of British comedy (and it's enduring following) lies in silliness built over episodes and seasons.

A note about the boxed sets...make sure all the seasons and the Specials are included.  For instance, the second series contains the two specials produced after the last season, for some odd reason.  The Specials both belong after the final season if you are looking to watch them in order. Cheers!",1369958400,,819,5.044444444444444

The Vicar of Dibley Series (most of which I have seen on PBS and also on Netflix) has always included closed captioning for hearing impaired.  The Immaculate Collection box-set stated that it was CC but it was not.  I am very hearing impaired and require my wife to be my ears for this boxed set.  The series is one of the funniest I have ever seen and had it been closed-captioned as stated it would have gotten five stars from me.  Another problem with my purchase was Amazon's ""recommended"" companion DVD's.  I purchased them also but they were already included in the boxed set!

It is absolutely fantastic Vicar material, they haven't lost their touch, and the assembled cast still has that magic chemistry.

They haven't lost any of their charm or wit and each character is funny and unique in their own way. You will find yourself waching over and over as I have. It's like visiting old friends, you never get tired of them. The Vicar of Dibley is simply one of the best british comedies ever to grace the small screen.

The Vicar herself has gained weight, and Alice looks a bit old to be the resident dingbat, but the cast continues to entertain, reprises just enough of the series' recurring elements, and adds to the overall story of the woman vicar who, against great odds, becomes the beloved servant of a crazy but endearing community.

2322350,3,B0009UZG78,"I love Dawn French, a comic genius, and marvelous as the Vicar of Dibley.  Like so many television series, the first year is fantastic, the second year is pretty good and each successive attempt is like a xerox machine copy, growing more feeble as you go along.  The Christmas episode makes a very good effort at entertainment, although there are crude moments.  Geraldine was never mean in season one, and here she becomes unpleasant.  We all knew David was a Tory but now there is a sense of outright hostility toward him.  But never mind by the New Year's episode he is well and truly put in his place by looking at sad-eyed children (do I hear echoes of Edina Monsoon?).  Yes, all the world's ills will be cured if only our penurious politicians donated enough money to the poor--ignoring the fact that billions have been donated to Africa.  Still in the middle of a comedy show we have to be preached to.  I'm surprised  a knitting pattern for a Burundi Bear wasn't included. I enjoyed the first 2 seasons because each episode was a 45 minute break from the world, but there's no necessity to be slapped in the face during the holiday season.  While I don't have high praise for this dvd I am glad I saw it.  Do buy The Wholly Holy Ending to see the resolution to all of Geraldine's problems, it's very satisfying.",1204416000,2,1319,4.5
2322351,4,B0009UZG78,"It's always a pleasure to go back and visit dear friends. No exception here.

Sure, the crowd in Dibley is getting a bit long in the tooth, but at least in the first episode, they have not lost their edge. I watched this episode with some close friends and we just roared with laughter with the familiar antics of the wacked out Dibley crowd.

The Christmas episode is a worthy end to the series and a high point.

The New Year's episode falls short with a well intentioned but forced bow to Live Aid, which is a bit too heavy handed and, frankly, dated for a series like this. At this point, the characters actions become strained and the situations are funny but not up to the previous episodes high points. However, who can fault Ms French for using her program's good name to fight a worthy cause?

Buy this CD for the holiday episode and enjoy the extra behind the scenes clips as a delightful bonus.",1201478400,2,905,4.401197604790419

The fact that the majority of these small English village residents are a bit over the top by American standards never seems out of place.

The characters are more cariactures and do not act as they should:  I'm sorry, but Geraldine sticking her whole HEAD into a chocolate fountain?  Not something she would do.  The cup of chocolate, yes.  The ""baptism by Cadbury""?  Not her at all.  Alice and Hugo offering a threesome to Geraldine?  Nuh-uh.  Nope.  No way.

Fantastic.,1141948800,4,349,4.242424242424242
2322446,2,B0009UZG78,"If this is your first venture into Dibley, stop now and go to the regular series. If you have seen the series and are thinking to see this one my best advice is read all these reviews first. Nice to say, but let me do the more important thing and give some reasons.

First a little context. Having watched the regular series several times over on TV, I bought the DVD versions and have enjoyed them immensely. With this in mind I eagerly bought the ""Specials"" disk. On first viewing one can easily wonder what the writers and cast could have been thinking when they put these shows together? Overall one is left with a feeling of sadness with what has been done to an otherwise superb series. A less friendly reviewer would simply call it bad art.

The characterization is disappointing to say the least. Geraldine seems angry and bitter and appears to be playing the part of the vicar as opposed to being the vicar. Perhaps the most shocking scene is the supposed comic scene where she plunges into the chocolate fountain. This, for someone who has followed the series, is a disturbing departure from 'reality' and what one understands as the basics of her character. With the appearance of the Archbishop what comic sense there might have been evaporates into disappointment and perhaps even mild disgust. Her language in both specials has gone right over the top. Even allowing for some pretended 'British' sophistication there is little to offer here beyond shock value and that wears thin VERY quickly. The physical abuse delivered to Owen is gratuitous at best.

Alice fails. One might reasonably ask how a person, even in comedy, can raise 10 children and still try to carry off the inanity presented. Sure one expects it, but again the sense is a person playing the character rather than acting. At one point Alice gives away David's favorite picture worth a small fortune after we, and she, learn both its value and worth to David. This goes beyond folly into the cruel. Chambers is a great actress. One senses the writers have let her down terribly.

The David, Hugo, and Jim, still have a sense of who they are, and Owen is as weird as ever. That's the good news.

Jim's 'carol' is simply in bad taste and not a song he would ever have entertained in the series. For her part Geraldine would never have allowed it. This sort of departure becomes an embarassment. It isn't funny, it is just gross. To think either this or the chocolate scene funny suggests a serious inability to grasp what made this series great.

Decorating David's house pink was meretricious foolishness and not a thing either David or Hugo would have accepted even from Alice.

Overall the dialog was out of sync with what the characters were like before the specials. If they were actually like that now, Geraldine would be out of a job, David's economic interests would have failed, and the rest would be fringe elements in Dibley. While this stuff may work for rap music, it does not fit with the characters in the show. Equally, Geraldine's about how she wants to rip out Alice's throat verges on producing disgust rather than a laugh.

The 'defrocked' extra is interesting from the behind the cameras viewpoint. As has been observed it is a pity the funny bits there didn't make it into the show. The 'Comic relief' part had, perhaps, the most humor on the disk. The David character here is, however, the most shallow and least 'david-like'. Geraldine's sacrifice of her ring and TV for Alice was very O'Henry-ish, but rather lost in the mess.

The 'Drunk' sequence was, again, out of character and mean rather than funny or appropos of the story. Equally, Alice would hardly have been the character to carry off the level of explanation presented. All in all it just didn't work.

The serious ending of the New Years episode was intended to be meaningful, but at the end of a show that was fairly wretched the social point was rather lost.

There were some funny bits, but not enough (and not nearly the story) to justify the making of this disk.

At the end we sat there trying to think of reasons why we shouldn't simply trash this one in spite of having bought it new. I am still having difficulty convincing myself with the phrase: ""Well, it was worth seeing once."" It will sit on the shelf with the promise of a long time before another possible viewing.

Sadly, if this is the best they could come up with one sincerely hopes they do no more. That said, I sincerely hope they can come up with something, somehow, somewhere, that can redeem the damage done here.

Let us pray.",1138060800,39,4569,4.624691358024691
2322447,5,B0009UZG78,"I really don't know what all these reviewers are bitching about. These specials are simply fantastic, and as funny as the funniest Vicar episodes we've seen before (and I have watched every single one of them many times, so I know). Ok, perhaps the first one is a little thin plotwise, with the ""lesbian"" plot dropped halfaway, but the chocolate fountain scene is worth the price of the set alone, and had me howling. The second special turns quite serious and moving at the end, but so what? It's great to see how swiftly a great cast can change the mood of a show and move you in unexpected ways. The special features are also excellent, with the Comedy Relief sketch always a welcome bonus. Fans and ""newbies"", you can buy this with confidence.

2322448,2,B0009UZG78,"I was so looking forward to these specials. I really miss the series, was thrilled to find that the 2 specials had been produced and would be released. After seeing them, though, I can't help but think they should have left well enough alone and ended VofD with the final series episode. The characters have lost all charm here and almost everyone seems just to be going through the motions. It's beyond obvious that most of the actors have moved on and really weren't interested in returning to Dibley. The jokes and plot lines are simplistic and common -- almost like the blandest of U.S. sitcoms. That kind of silly. The most disappointing thing was that Geraldine seems to have disappeared altogether. In her place is a vicar lacking in all the depth, charm and humor of her former self. I don't know if it was the writers, French or whomever, but I would rather not have seen Geraldine in this way. One of the things I loved about VofD was that Geraldine was this great, complex, compassionate female character. In the specials, she's reduced to being a totally neurotic, desperate-for-a-husband,depressive, pre-menopausal twit who doesn't care about Dibley or her church any longer. You get the feeling she thinks she's wasted her life away over the last 10 years. She's become vapid and stupid. It betrays the positive thread that ran through the entire series. It's a sad swan song for a great character. I'm surprised Dawn French agreed to even play her this way.

The specials brought the reminder that VofD seemed to be losing some steam even in the last series or so of the regular show. The humor got cruder, less witty, less ""smart."" The characters were becoming caricatured and were losing some of their quirky charm even then. I think it was a sign that it was time to end. As much as I'd love for VofD to go on forever, I think that unless it can keep the magic of its first seasons intact, its time is done. More specials like these would just be depressing.",1130889600,33,1976,4.62962962962963

Sure, all the same characters are back, the town is back, and the situations are back ... but it just feels like they all have lost it.  It is either the fact that they have lost their characters within 10 years, or just the fact that they were not sure what they were doing with their return.  Who knows?  All I know is that these were not the same characters that I once knew and laughed at consistently.

Dawn French is back, but she seems to have lost her spark.  Her character of Geraldine Granger seems angrier, less spontaneous, less clever and more vicious.  It is hard for me to tell if she actually wanted to return to do the reunion.  Her words towards the rest of her community did not feel like it had the heart is once did.  Once she was a part of a very funny village, now it feels as if she needed to be the center of the village.  See the difference?  The same can be said for the other members as well.  Alice, aka Emma Chambers, completely forgot her character.  She wasn't even the same.  It isn't hard to play the slow-starter of the area, but make-up, fancy clothing, and everything else just made me feel like I was watching the actor play Alice instead of Alice interacting with Geraldine.  She was a defineite low point to the ""specials"".  Everyone else seemed to be decently playing their notorious characters.  Owen seemed much calmer in these episodes, Frank didn't seem to age a bit, Jim still made me laugh (not in the ""New Years"" Special), and the Hortons seemed like themselves.  It was quite a toned down performance since their riveting beginning during their first three seasons.  Remember how the final episode of the third season just didn't feel like it matched the rest?  Well, that was how this entire ""Specials"" DVD felt.  It didn't match and the characters we fell in love with stopped making us laugh and instead just bumbled their way through their lines.

I must also say that I am extremely disappointed with the ""New Years"" special.  Not only was it NOT funny, but I really dislike when we dedicate entire episodes to a cause.  I realize the importance to it, but it just didn't fit in a ""Vicar of Dibley"" episode.  The ending, while meant to be a tearjerker, was horrendous.  It nearly ruined the original three seasons for me.  I just felt as if the actors were doing it for a cause, which didn't fit the mantra of the other seasons.  If the show would have originally been like this, then maybe it would have worked, but for me it was just a cheap ploy to get tears from the audience.  It was sick.

Overall, I cannot restate the issue that if you watch these ""specials"" (which I think is an over-evaluation of the truth) before watching the actual series, you will be in for a bit surprise.  I believe that if I would have watched the ""specials"" first, than I would not have bothered to watch the series.  I wouldn't have seen the humor at all.  In two, hour long episodes, I believe that I probably only laughed once.  That was when Geraldine was drunk at church.  Humorous, but nothing in compared to the laugh riot I felt with the original series.  A massive disappointment that should embarrass both the viewer and those involved with the actual production.  Shame on you Vicar, you should not have allowed this to happen!
