1901682,5,B0000A4G7E,"My three-year-old son has loved this movie more than any other Bob the Builder video for more than a year. He cannot take his eyes off of it-and it's a fairly long show. Luckily, it's entertaining enough for the whole family to watch with interest. We highly recommend this for Bob enthusiasts and first-timers.",1124236800,6,311,4.777777777777778
1901683,5,B0000A4G7E,"My 2 1/2 year-old son received this dvd as a Christmas gift and LOVES it! It's now February and he still asks to watch it frequently. It is well-produced and entertaining so we don't mind watching it as well.
Yes, it is longer (obviously) and more complex than the Bob TV series, and some children may get bored with it. And Elton John fans, be warned, his character does not have a very big role.",1075766400,8,397,4.306666666666667
1901684,4,B0000A4G7E,"We weren't sure about this one based on earlier reviews, but thought we'd try it. We have a 3-year-old Bob devotee who would definitely know if he saw a sub-standard Bob movie, but he absolutely loves it. He loves seeing Bob and his brother at the end. The tractors are great in this one and the addition of Lennie and the Lazers is great. The movie is a great advance in the team's animation and cinematography (not that 3-yr-olds care about that, but it makes it more enjoyable if you're an adult).  The writing is fresh and enjoyable, and the characters are crisp and fun. The mayor is bossy, but hey, there are people in the world like that, good or bad. Everyone works together just as always. This movie is a lot of fun!",1074988800,5,726,4.377777777777778
1901685,5,B0000A4G7E,"Fantastic! This is a movie to own and enjoy even when the kids are at school! We love it!
My children are five and nine and they BOTH enjoy it every night!
We have owned it for over a month!",1070323200,6,190,3.775
1901686,2,B0000A4G7E,"My son, a huge Bob the Builder fan, told me he was bored and when it was finally over, he said ""Is it Over?, Good"".
It is not at all like the regular episodes.  There were a lot of new characters to keep track of too.",1068854400,7,217,3.717391304347826
1901687,4,B0000A4G7E,"We have been waiting for this for over a year, and my 4 year-son old  was VERY happy to see it finally arrive. We loved the last ""feature length"" movie (Knights of fix-a-lot) so I knew that this story would be able to hold his attention for the full story. I LOVED seeing Elton John... which my son couldn't care less about. He wished he could see the trucks more. (They didn't do much work in this story that is for sure.) He also wanted to see Bob and his brother (Tom) together more... don't want to spoil it, but they don't get together till the end! He didn't get to see them spend Christmas together, which was the whole point of the movie to him. He also thought the new Mayor was bossy... which she was.
So.... we liked it, but thought it was quite a bit different from the usual fix-everything-format. My son still asks to watch this one, but more often asks to watch other ""Bob movies"".",1066867200,14,896,4.270588235294118

7995740,4,B0000A4G7E,"We simply love Bob the Builder and his movies are about teaching as well as entertaining, I would recommend this for anyone.",1391817600,,124,4.681818181818182
7995741,1,B0000A4G7E,"The original ""A Christmas to Remember"" features the voice talent of Neil Morrissey as Bob and Kate Harbour as Wendy and Dizzy.

Despite the misleading product description, the version sold here is the U.S. dubbed one with William Dufris as Bob and Lorelei King as Wendy.  Although Kate Harbour is retained for Dizzy, but the other machines are dubbed with the predictable American drawls.

Whereas the British Bob contains multiple subtle nods to the parents watching, such as Lenny Lazenby's description of how they found America, or the Mayor's observations of Noddy Holder, the U.S. version bungles these nuances with sloppy script editing.

Elton John's voice remains unmodified thankfully.",1387065600,,694,5.339449541284404
7995742,5,B0000A4G7E,I just love this Bob the Builder Christmas special.  It features guest star Elton John as part of the rock group Lenny and the Lasers and Bob's twin brother Tom.  A fun movie!,1247702400,,175,4.2727272727272725
7995743,5,B0000A4G7E,"My grandson is 16 months old and he loves Bob-Bob (as he calls him). This precious baby is always so busy so he is a hand full.  Nearly the only time he will sit still is for Bob-Bob and Christmas movies.  This puts them together and he loves it.  My daughter loves it because it gives her some free time and it's also an entertaining video that always has some bit of educational benefit to it.  We recommend all the Bob, The Builder video's.  One day, our grandson told us he was Bob-Bob. Guess he just wanted a change of identity for a few hours. So great that he has already learned how to play 'pretend'.",1229040000,,609,4.2155172413793105

7995745,3,B0000A4G7E,"We love Bob but this one isn't his best...  Has Elton John in it which is kind of strange but whatever...  Kind of boring and hard storyline for a 2 year old to follow, but in the end, a nice message of the importance of family.",1168214400,,228,3.9347826086956523
7995746,5,B0000A4G7E,"My son has about 20 Christmas DVDs and this is one of our favorites!

This heartwarming story has Bob's twin brother, Tom, trying to make it home for Christmas--clear from the the Arctic Circle! Will he make it in time?

A Christmas to Remember has a heartwarming--and well crafted--plot, and features a guest appearance by Elton John!

I admit--I tear up when I see the baby videos showing Tom and Bob playing as kids...as well as Bob's disappointment when he hears that Tom missed his boat. It's a very heartwarming tale with some very funny moments!

Of course, Wendy, Spud, and the rest of the can-do crew make appearances in this story--as do ""Lennie and the Lazers""!

At around 50 minutes, this engaging DVD will delight fans of Bob the Builder, as well as small children. And, it's a DVD that a parent can sit through comfortably without being bored to death or driven insane by mindless drivel or grating singing--which is a great plus!",1164067200,,944,4.696969696969697
7995747,4,B0000A4G7E,"My 5 year old watches this tape over and over.  He especially likes Elton John's song.  When it comes on the radio, he says that's the ""Bob the builder christmas song"".",1152662400,,168,4.387096774193548
