8583605,5,B00CMSHAN8,"This man not only wrote the music, but the story, each and every character, designed the stage, and lighting and effects, the dance choreography and on top of it he is also performing, dancing, and playing instruments not to mention all the time in character through the whole 4 hr performance. And this he did after a 2 yr break. If you are a Gackt fan, you won't regret this. I think this was one of his best tours apart from Diabolos of course... which in my opinion is another worldly experience. Who enters a concert racing on a horse, full costume and makeup, around the arena seats? and much more... that was just the entrance. Ummm I can't think of any one else that could be at this level of effort and out of his own pocket because record companies in Japan, don't pay for that. I highly recommend this.",1396569600,,813,4.3907284768211925
