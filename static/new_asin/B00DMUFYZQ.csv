5834087,5,B00DMUFYZQ,"This movie is the ultimate revenge movie. As a fan of the originals I have to say this movie left me sitting on the edge of my seat cheering like crazy for the victim. It's pretty graphic and not for the weak of stomach and the story has a nice ""Hostel"" feel to it, yet it's original. I would also like to thank the studios involved for releasing uncensored content, after all that takes some backbone.  Highly recommended!",1379980800,4,423,4.423076923076923
5834088,4,B00DMUFYZQ,"First of all, I loved the original I Spit on your Grave, I loved the remake just as much, and I love this sequel equally as much as the other 2 films. I usually don't go that much in depth with my reviews because I don't like to give too much of the movie away, but I feel compelled to share everything this time around because there is just so much to appreciate about this movie; I don't even know where to start. This movie is an undiscovered masterpiece, or at the very least, an obscure cult classic. At times I couldn't help but get this whole Taken meets Hostel reminiscent feeling, but that's what sets it apart from the others. This movie is full of unknown characters, yet it packs a powerful punch in terms of acting. Don't be fooled, I almost missed this and I'm glad I didn't because this is not a typical B-movie with bad actors, and a equally bad plot. Plus, as a woman, I appreciate the female victim becoming the heroine, or should I say, the timid female protagonist evolving into the dark antagonist.

Second of all, it was really refreshing to see that this movie starts off in New York because being that I am a Southerner; I was beginning to take it personally that these types of movies from Deliverance to I Spit On Your Grave all depict Southerners as toothless, uneducated, hillbillies who can't wait until some sophisticated Northerner comes down South only to be raped, terrorized, humiliated, and eventually killed.

Katie is a very nave aspiring model on the streets of New York City, and being that she is from the Midwest it's easy to see upfront where she makes a lot of her mistakes. Katie needs a better portfolio, but she doesn't have the money to invest in a real photo shoot, so she ends up answering an add placed on a bulletin board promising free pictures to aspiring models. Pause...the fact that this could happen to anyone only makes it more scary. Katie did a lot of dumb things that young women do all the time. Now...Katie's first mistake was that she should have known there was a catch because nothing in this world is free. Also, when she got ready to do her photo shoot she went all alone, and this type of thing should not happen, but it does all the time that's why it's realistic.

After she shows up, there is another model already there, so it does give her a false sense of security, but you still get the feeling that the whole scene is uncomfortable and creepy from the very beginning. After she changes her clothes and starts to take the pictures the photographer asks her to take off all her clothes, and she stands her ground firmly by saying no. However, one of the predators on the set at the photo shoot has become smitten with her, and has begun to stalk her. That leads me to the next colossal mistake she made by leaving her front door open while she took her trash out. I don't care that it was just down the hall when it only takes a fraction of a second for someone to slip into your apartment; which unfortunately Katie finds out the hard way.

Just like the other movies you can count on the rape scenes being powerful and brutal. I cried several times, but this time around it was a little different because her assailant calls in his brothers as reinforcements to help him clean up the mess after he has done the deed. It is clear that this isn't a first for either of them, and they have a sick sense of twisted family loyalty. At this point, you begin to ask yourself why don't they just go ahead and kill her and get it over with? On the contrary, they have plans that are so much bigger for her. They actually plan to drug her and frame her for the murder of the building's maintenance man who was killed when he walked in on the attack in progress, but there's more. Katie is drugged, abducted, and taken to another country where she is forced into sexual enslavement, used as a toy, and raped repeatedly for amusement. The whole scene is disturbing while this young girl is chained up naked and tortured like an animal, and on top of everything else, her so-called escape is short-lived because she is betrayed by another woman who is supposed to be helping her. As you can expect, once they are done with her she is buried alive and left for dead. This is where it really gets good!

I couldn't help but root this girl on because she gave every single person involved exactly what they deserved. Katie's revenge is effective, well-done, and executed perfectly according to how they treated her. Forget two wrongs don't make a right; it's all about getting even. I loved it! I realize some people may have other expectations in what they like to see, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one.",1379721600,63,4666,4.433566433566433
5834089,3,B00DMUFYZQ,"""Tell me you like me!"" Katie (Dallender) is an aspiring model living in New York. Trying to make a more professional portfolio she accepts an offer for a free photo shoot. Things are going well until they ask her to take nude shots. Refusing, she leaves but the crew finds her and does the unthinkable. Now all Katie has on her mind is revenge. If you have seen the first one you will know what to expect. If you haven't I should warn you this is extremely graphic and violent and not for everyone. There are intense scenes of torture and mutilation but because the woman doing these things was raped by the people she is doing this to it makes it hard to feel sorry for them. If you liked the first one you will like this too, but again if you don't think you can handle it don't watch it. This is for a select group. Overall, not as good as the first but mainly because the rape and abuse of the woman seemed worse and that isn't fun to watch. I give it a C+.",1379289600,29,961,4.117021276595745
5834090,5,B00DMUFYZQ,"This movie is surprisingly awesome. I've seen the original and the one prior to this version and neither had a story quite as good as this one. This version definitely captures the spirit of vengeance. The main actress Jemma Dallender made this film a masterpiece in so many ways. The movie is not a sequel, but just another story in the genre. If there was a female version of the Crow movie, this would definitely be it.",1379203200,11,422,4.4935064935064934
5834091,4,B00DMUFYZQ,"Yes, at first I was like, a sequel, really? And it's not a direct sequel, just a similar occurrence. But man, this movie is brutal. Nothing I hate more than rape, even fictionalized I get angry and demand retribution. There are a lot of rape/revenge movies out there, but I am honestly surprised to say that this is one of the best. The original movie and remake are very good in their own right but I think this one actually tops it. I fully expected this to be unnecessary tripe, I was amazed. The story is well thought out, the acting is very good and the direction is downright gripping. It is a little too predictable, but that's not a huge complaint. The rape scenes and violence are very graphic, so be forewarned. A bloody tale of vengeance that should not be ignored.",1378684800,88,776,4.433566433566433
5834092,5,B00DMUFYZQ,"This movie caught me completely off guard. I wasn't expecting it to be good at all because I was thinking

""how can you make a sequel to the first one, without it being the same idea?""

What I liked the most about this movie was that is wasn't really the same as the first one. It had a different feel to it then the first one. In the first movie, there were like only 8 people through out the whole movie?

In this movie there are more characters and I am not just talking about the bad guys. More people outside the girl and the bad guys were involved. The setting was different in this movie as well. We went from a remote forest setting to a city setting in two different countries.

The bad guys in this film had a more of a purpose on why they treated the girl the way they did as opposed to the first film where the guys were just sick people who did their acts out of complete randomness. I'm not saying the people in this movie weren't sick, but in this film there was more of a reason why they were like that.

The girl in this film acted great, no complaints what so whatever. Now for the torture scenes.
Before watching this film, my thoughts were ""are the torture scenes going to be as good as the first one?""
I was hoping the scenes be just as disgusting as the first film. This movie lived up to it.
The torture scenes in this film were just as grueling and disturbing as the first one.

I have no complaints to make about this movie because it gave me ALOT more than what I expected.
I will be getting this on DVD because I love showing this type of film to people that are not familiar with these films. I love seeing people's reactions to these films, they are just priceless. I saw the first movie at least 6 times because I watched it with 6 different people. All of their reactions were priceless",1378684800,8,1817,4.162393162393163
5834093,5,B00DMUFYZQ,"I'm a huge fan of the first movie! So I was really excited for the sequel. The thing I like about this movie (I guess I should start calling it ""movie series"" now) is the fact that hate can surpass any other feeling, which is the biggest lesson from this movie.
Since this is a direct-to-video sequel, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the first movie, but in my opinion, I think it's really awesome. If you can't stand scenes like really graphic violence, or rape, this movie isn't for you. I think I could stand it, but I was covering my eyes. Jemma Dallender plays an amazing victim, but an amazing revenger too! But the movie is not only filled of torture, it also has some shocking twists and turns that really shocked me the first time I saw it. There are some predictable things I would had changed, but overall it's a great film, you'll be shocked.
It just sucks that this movie didn't came out on theaters, because it had the potential to be a box office hit! I can't wait to get my copy, and I'm looking forward for part 3! Really recommended to fans of the remake and the original version, you'll love it!",1378512000,25,1121,4.2924528301886795

5834113,3,B00DMUFYZQ,"Maintains the graphic, hopeless and oppressive atmosphere of the 2010 remake but not as streamlined and tends to be overlong in places. Ultimately it caters to the baser instincts of the viewer and succeeds in that regard. Recommended for genre fans even if it does require some suspension of disbelief and acceptance of a world in which extreme vengeance has no repercussions whatsoever.

5834115,1,B00DMUFYZQ,"As many reviewers said, the first one is better. This second in the series dwells too much on the victimizing part. All you need is enough brutal treatment to feel empathy for the woman. The revenge part is too little of the whole. Getting revenge is what I thought this series was about. In the first one our woman turns the acts of the perpetuators into the hell they created. In this second one she doesn't even finish off the last creep. A cop has to save her.

With the 2nd one, I didn't expect as much. This was surprisingly even better. It's gory, it's violent, but if you went through what this character went through, you'd only hope to be as creative. Hell with modeling, she should consider a career as an assassin.",1478131200,,455,4.416666666666667

To put it quite frankly, the movie was filled with brutal gore and violence that seemed to exist solely for the sake of showing senseless violence. The rape scene was disturbing and nearly made me sick to my stomach. This being said, Katey, the courageous young woman who is forced to endure all of that torment, is very likable. The audience feels it as she exacts her revenge on the human traffickers who kidnapped and tortured her. Having the edition of the Orthodox priest who finds himself in a moral dilemma helped what is otherwise an ultra violent exploitation flick.",1453852800,,737,4.633587786259542

5834200,4,B00DMUFYZQ,"Best written of the series so far. Very intricate, scary plot. In this one, for a change, not every man is bad and not every woman is good, more like real life. It does point up the problem with formula movies, the forgotten man in this story is the murder victim who is never mentioned, investigated or avenged in any way. If ever I come to the aid of a crime victim and am killed for my trouble, I hope she will at least mention the fact that I was killed to the police so there can be an investigation, and if she takes her own revenge, make some small comment on it when she is getting her own revenge, e.g. ""this is also for my friend who tried to help me, but was killed."" Just saying. Not everything is about you, Katie. If not for the formula, I am sure these good writers could have written an even better story than this. This one was way better at fitting the revenge with the crime than the first re-make, i.e. the bad guys were much more deserving of the punishment meted out by the victim.

This is a good film, and I think most people who enjoyed 2010's ""I Spit on Your Grave"" are likely to enjoy this sequel. It focuses on a different woman, in a different place, who goes through a similar, life-altering experience as the heroine in the first film did.

Despite reports to the contrary, this is a very well-made film, with excellent directing, skillful cinematography and a very good cast of performers. Jemma Dallender deserves special mention as the starring lead, and a young actress who brings a wealth of bravery and emotive power to the role. She really does a fantastic job, and you truly believe her transformation from plucky aspiring model to scarred avenging angel.

ISOYG 2 actually manages to up the ante over its previous installment, but showing even more explicit nudity and brutal violence. And Ms Dallender's scenes of traumatic torture at the hands of her captors were truly impressive in their scope. My one minor complaint would be a certain lack of punch in some of the revenge kills she later embarks on.

The lead actress in ISOYG 2 is, however, deserving of some credit for her performance in this role, as the #1 point I referred to was actually quite brutal, and she carried it off in a disturbingly believable way.

5834268,2,B00DMUFYZQ,"The sequel to 2010's remake of I Spit On Your Grave, features a very similar storyline, however it takes torture and gore to whole other level. Unlike many Horror fans, I love blood and gore, but there has to be a line, and this film crossed it early and often. I've seen thousands of movies and a good portion of my collection is Horror, so I thought I'd seen it all, then comes this film. Using blood, puss, feces, and extreme genital mutilation, I Spit On Your Grave 2 is so extreme, that even I was wincing and turning away from the screen. The story is almost identical to the first, as a young woman is abducted, raped, tortured, and left for dead, but she survives and plans her brutal revenge. The first film took place in a cabin in the woods, while this one features a girl abducted by human traffickers and brought to Belarus. Other than the location and the extreme depravity, these films are nearly identical, yet the sequel gets two stars less than it's predecessor because it is much too long and it really is vile. I understand that Horror is a very hard genre to develop original ideas in, and I also understand that in order to stand out, one director is always trying to out do the other, but this movie is so beyond disgusting that it makes the Saw movies look like a Disney production. As for the cast, it is almost completely comprised of newcomers, and unlike the first there really isn't a whole lot of dialogue. Jemma Dallender stars, and while I appreciate that even pretending to have some of those things done to you must be rough, she really shows no personality. She's a victim from the second the film starts and transforms into a psychopath who simply repeats her captures lines to them as she tortures them back. The 2010 remake had a good story, was well thought out, and while it was pretty violent, it was within reason. I Spit On Your Grave 2 is nothing more than a snuff film, with scenes of things that people should never see. The first film was a must see movie, but as is often the case, you can really skip the sequel.",1412553600,2,2061,4.397905759162303

I read reviews on the movie before I saw it and yes, it's graphic but I did think the punishment fit the crime.  Perhaps more rapists would reconsider if they knew this was coming. . call me weird but I actually liked the way she got them back, quite inventive.

5834298,4,B00DMUFYZQ,"""I Spit on Your Grave 2"" stands apart on its own from the first film ""I Spit On Your Grave"". The first film was nothing more than a really bad snuff film with a story line. The first film goes directly into gruesome abuse and is simply quit vulgar. Part two on the other hand is a story of revenge and at times takes on the spirit of Dumas's story The Count of Monte Cristo. Part two tells the events of how the main character survives her ordeal in which she is brutally tortured and left for dead. Most audiences members of the first film probably had the same questions I did when they saw the first film. After all that torture and abuse how does one even get up and walk away to come back for revenge? This film answers that question.",1402704000,,739,4.174825174825175

It was almost scene for scene of director Steven Monroe's first sequel, only this time with a NYC setting and then Bulgaria. I guess he thought it would be more sinister to use foreigners than the obligatory backwoods types. While actress Jemma Dallender gave a great performance, she did not have the vulnerable and more realistic style that Sarah Butler brought to the first sequel. Dallender had the misfortune of having to say some of the worst lines I have heard which gave what were to be brutal scenes a comical feel. Some of the twists in I Spit on Your Grave 2 were good but not new, and the ending was nowhere near as powerful as the Sarah Butler version. I hope that director Monroe has gotten doing the same movie twice out of his system and can move forward and give us something actually new.

By some miracle she lives and comes back to exact revenge on her tormentors. The story line has been done before many times. But this one was slightly fresh and worked well.

I won't reveal specifics to prevent any spoilers but rest assured she gets the bad guys back in a big way.

5834334,1,B00DMUFYZQ,"So I just sat through the movie I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE 2 and have to say for a sequel it equals the first film. That is to say if you found the first film offensive and made with the sole intent of doing nothing more than attempting to be controversial and vomit inducing. Hmm maybe I should explain.

I've never been fond of the whole ""torture porn"" genre of films. Amazingly those who make these types of films get offended when they are placed in that category which is kind of surprising since these easily offended more often than not try to offend their viewers. When the film HOSTEL gained notoriety I went to see it and felt like I needed a shower afterwards. Most of these films have the thinnest of plot lines and almost all of the story involves trying to make an excuse to show people being tortured. I could be wrong but when people like Dick Smith, Rob Bottin and Rick Baker were attempting to push further the art of make up effects my guess is it wasn't so that a movie could focus around effects of this sort. After HOSTEL things didn't change much. Locations and victims perhaps but not a search for a more in depth story or for that matter a story at all.

The original film I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE was considered ground breaking because something like this had never been done before. Feminists flocked to it because you had a female character abused by males who then went on a revenge streak that culminated in all of her abusers dying and at least on castrated. I was never a big fan of the film but at least recognized it as a trail blazer and something that hadn't been done before. The remake was something else. It didn't attempt to further the story or make it new but simply retread the original story with one exception. Since time had gone by they could now up the ante when it came to how far they could go. Of course the majority of the things they went further on were the things done to the woman. I still wish someone would explain to me how stripping a woman down to no clothing, showing her being repeatedly raped and then tortured furthers the cause of feminism even if her protagonists all get their just desserts.

So let's talk about this new movie. Before I do so realize that this review will include some MAJOR SPOILERS so stop now if this is your type of film. I'm offering quite a bit in the hopes that most people will read and then be repulsed enough to bypass this film. The old characters are tossed aside and in their place are new ones. Had I been a bigger fan of the first film I would have realized that this wasn't the same character. Not realizing that I kept wondering how someone who went through all the things in the first movie could be stupid enough to do what she does here. New ""heroine"" Katie is a hostess at a restaurant in New York who wants to be a model. An agent tells her the pictures she has are too Midwest (always a bad thing according to people on both coasts) and need to be edgier. Katie sees a sign posted on a bulletin board stating that models can get their photo work done for free. Yeah, nothing seems wrong about something like this offer in New York.

Going to the photo shoot Katie's photographer and friends all have eastern European accents, another immediate sign that things won't go well. Except that characters in movies never notice bad signs. When she doesn't follow through with some of their requests she leaves. At home she wakes to find one of these guys in her apartment who then ties her up and rapes her. When her friend the custodian tries to help, he's killed. The rapists calls his friends, they drug Katie and take her away.
Katie wakes to find herself chained up in a basement on a dirty mattress. Ever notice how torture chambers and kidnapper's hideouts are always filthy? They must not have unionized yet. Katie screams but of course no one can hear her. She's raped by another of the bad guys. Eventually she escapes only to realize she's not in NY any longer. A police officer helps her and she finds out she's in Bulgaria. That was some date rape drug! The officer gets an assist from a woman who owns a shelter for battered women. Well, he doesn't realize it but the home is really not to help battered women but to supply them to BE battered. Yes, the house she takes Katie to is the same house she escaped from.

Katie is then raped and tortured some more, this time by a client of the woman who feels the need to use a cattle prod on Katie. I'll leave it up to your imagination how he chooses to do so but can tell you now that your imagination is probably correct. The group of original thugs decide the best thing to do is get rid of Katie so putting their minds together they decide to bury her alive in an equipment case in the cellar. Are you seeing how smart these guys are? I mean first off they don't actually kill her but bury her alive and secondly they do it in their own basement. But they're more stupid than that. It turns out the basement is on top of a series of tunnels beneath the city and the case drops through into one of them and Katie is set free.

From there we go to the moments of these films that fans wait for, the revenge portion. One by one she exacts her revenge on each of the members. One is tied up and sliced with a high degree of infection setting into his wounds. Another is drugged, nearly drowned in a urine filled toilet and then actually drowned in a toilet filled with liquid excrement. The woman is locked in a trunk of her own. And the last guy...well he wakes to find himself strapped to a table with his testicles locked in a vice. I guess this is another of those attempts at equality since we have full frontal male nudity rather than the usual female. A side story has had a priest who helped Katie after her second escape consulting with the earlier seen police officer who truly was unknowing of the part he played in her capture and who is now trying to help her.

So let's talk about the movie some rather than the plotline, which is thin at best. As I said early on this movie isn't about feminist's ideas or about empowering women. It's about exploitation and the worst kind at that. It's about showing a naked woman as the object of male supposed male fantasy. Abused in nearly every way possible this is not a way to show strength in a woman. And when about 70 of the films 106 minutes are her being abused and less than that about her revenge, it becomes clear that the exploitation of a woman is the theme here. Well that and torture of course.

I myself find no enjoyment in watching the torture of another human being for the sake of so called ""entertainment"". When watching say a terrorist vs. spy film and torture is used to coerce the subject into revealing where a bomb or kidnap victim is that's something else and it usually isn't used to the extent this film and its ilk use it. Those scenes are usually brief rather than taking up most of the screen time. These films are made simply for the freaks of the world who find enjoyment in the debasement of others.

It would be nice if someone made a kidnap movie or horror film that didn't involve how low we can go as a society. It would be nice if these films reached the popularity of the films that involved torture. A new generation has no idea who someone like Karloff or Lugosi were but think they know all about horror films and place ones like this on the top of their list. They completely miss the mark in doing so and it frightens me to think of what future film makers will come up with.
In the meantime after watching this film a thought kept coming back to me. Katie's last male victim. The last man she tortures literally has his testicles being squeezed slowly in a vice. Having sat through all 106 minutes of this film I think between the two of us he got the better end of the deal than I did.",1388448000,13,7838,4.2976995940460085
5834335,1,B00DMUFYZQ,"Nine Things about I Spit On Your Grave 2

1. In 1978, the original, notorious film I Spit On Your Grave was released. In 2010, a pointless remake was made.

2. In 2013, the director of the pointless remake made this even more pointless sequel.
Even as a sequel to a bad movie, this movie sucks.

3. It has nothing to do with either previous version of I Spit On Your Grave. Its just more of the same.

4. Its about a Missouri girl who moves to New York to become a model. She runs into some sleazy photographers who kidnap her and take her to Bulgaria for some unexplained reason. Then they rape and torture her, and leave her for dead.

5. She survives and lives in the sewers under a church instead of going to the American Embassy which is like a block away. When shes insane enough, she puts on her crazy face and takes revenge on her captors in the most cruel ways she can think of. Then the movie ends.

6. It doesnt say anything new. Its tedious and boring and less creative than the first one. The acting is terrible. Even the gore is kind of stupid.

7. I suspect the script was a reject from Hostel 4. Seriously, does everyone in Eastern Europe participate in slavery and sex trafficking?

8. It was released in one movie theater for one week and made $809.

9. For hardcore horror fans that just like to keep up with the various genres, its slightly interesting from a filmmaking perspective. But anyone else should just spit on its grave and walk away.",1388361600,5,1464,4.313868613138686

5834350,5,B00DMUFYZQ,"I got this flick on blu-ray/dvd combo. I was worried, since it was from the director of the remake, but I decided to be brave. I popped it in and was BLOWN AWAY! This movie is sensational. It takes you back to the brutality and horror of the original. The remake was not very good, because in a rape/revenge movie you are supposed to be on the woman's side NOT THE DAMN RAPISTS! I watched that remake feeling myself being more sympathetic to those guys, because they decided to spend more time developing those characters, instead of the woman, who we are supposed to be caring for in the first place.
This movie solves that problem.
Jemma Dallender is an acting powerhouse in this movie. Her acting is FAR MORE BRAVE than Sarah Butler's. Jemma is a true successor to Camille Keaton. She should get an academy award for this. She is sympathetic. I care about her. She emotes very well. You get the sense she is very angry at what has been done to her (rightfully so). I watched this movie, rooting for her all the way.
The actors playing the rapists were good actors (playing scumbags very well). I know it's a movie, but these guys make you wonder. A couple of other nice twists and turns are also in this flick.
If I have to make a criticism, I would say the rape scene in the apartment when the guy is stabbed and slowly dying, very much reminds me of THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT remake. Other than that, this is a very good movie. Very brutal.
Sorry, but I would just dismiss the 2010 remake and just stick with the 1978 film and make this a sequel to that. These are supposed to be PRO-WOMAN movies, not ANTI-WOMEN movies. I am supposed to learn rape is sick and wrong and this film and the 1978 film totally re-enforces that. If this is going to be a franchise, keep making them like this and I'll keep watching.
One last thing: I don't wanna see her get raped, but I have to say: JEMMA DALLENDER is astonishingly beautiful.",1384992000,,1929,4.346260387811634

Although she was as terrorized as the girl from the first movie she was also less sympathetic, especially once she starts getting her revenge.  Part of the issue is also the actress here was not bad, but also not great.  It is really hard to pull off the raw emotions this movie requires.  Especially in the second half when she has to be brutal yet somehow remain above the brutality.  Butler in the first movie played it with an emotional flatness that really worked, but here there was a lot more anger to the role.

I Spit on Your Grave 2 (2013) **
D: Steven R. Monroe
C: Joe Absolom, Jemma Dallender, Alexander Aleksiev, Mary Stockley, Michael Dixon
P: A young model looking for some new images for her portfolio is attacked, beaten, raped, tortured and even pissed on by some wannabe photographers who even bury her alive. Managing to survive the entire ordeal, she manages to gather enough strength so that she can exact brutal revenge on her attackers.

I Spit on Your Grave 2, like its predecessors, uses the simplest justification possible in establishing its scenario. Men are scum. A woman has been beaten & raped and she needs revenge.

What can I really say about I Spit on Your Grave 2? The rape and torture scenes are painful to sit through, a real endurance test. It's slick and professionally made on every level. It even has some striking imagery. The lead actress, as was the case in the previous films, wasn't chosen so much for her acting prowess, but for the fact that she was willing to go there with the film's rape and torture scenes.

It's practically a remake of the previous films, except there's a new setting and a new cast. What do you expect of a film entitled I Spit on Your Grave 2? There's no real merit to the film, but somehow or another it must have caught me in the right frame of mind, as I found the revenge scenes practically satisfying, though I felt like I needed to take a shower immediately following the film.

5834365,3,B00DMUFYZQ,"I personally avoided this movie as I hadn't seen any of the others. The name of the movie alone was enough to prevent me from seeing this as it speaks of silly, teen slasher stuff instead of what it really was. They probably could have done much better using a different name for this.
That being said, after a friend of mine (who likes torture porn as well) strongly recommended this movie, I was taken by it. The brutality was pretty extensive. Without giving away too much, I gave a sold 3 stars for the horror, and passion of revenge that was built in.",1383696000,,556,4.355769230769231
5834366,3,B00DMUFYZQ,"Decent flick.  I was expecting something more closely related to the original, maybe a sequel or prequel.  Got neither, but the movie is still worth watching.  A few interesting twists take the movie in an unexpected direction, which is always nice.  Of course, one already knows that the story line is one of female exploitation and revenge, so there is no surprise there, but it is always nice to see people get what's coming to them.  One of the best characteristics of this film is the graphic nature of the revenge-kill scenes.  So graphic is one scene that I found myself looking away in the other direction--and I consider myself one of the most desensitized (to violence) movie watchers around.  Good movie.

5834373,5,B00DMUFYZQ,"When I first heard director Steven R. Monroe was making a sequel to his 2010 hit remake of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, I have to confess that I was skeptical.  The concept of a rape-revenge movie is not new in today's movie world, so I wasn't sure what he planned to accomplish.  But after I watched it, I was blown away.  I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE 2 is an amazing and brutal sequel, but it could very well be a stand-alone film.  Either way, it's definitely worth your consideration.

I wish my blog hadn't crashed last year, because I would have loved to direct you to my review of the first film (the remake, not the actual original).  I had the pleasure of meeting the cast and director at Texas Frightmare Weekend in Dallas a couple of years ago, which made watching the first film much easier.  If you've never watched a revenge flick like this, they can be brutally realistic and therefore difficult to see.

Just like it's predecessor, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE 2 is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  But what really makes this film is the acting.  The performance given by lead actress Jemma Dallender is nothing short of perfection.  According to her IMDB page, this is only the third professional acting job she has ever had, but WOW...she does an amazing job with her role.  She is not only beautiful, but she is very talented as well.  I cannot wait to see what she does in the future.

A secondary aspect that makes this movie so great is that it is unflinchingly realistic.  This film took the brutality and savagery of the first film and multiplied it exponentially.  There were a couple of scenes where I almost had to pause the film for a break.  One particular scene towards the end of the movie, when Katie is extracting her revenge on one of the men, was so excruciatingly realistic that I had to literally walk out of the room for a moment and collect myself.  The film is simply that good (and horrific).

I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE 2 is an amazing film, and if you can stomach it, I highly recommend it.  But be warned:  there are very graphic scenes in this film, both from a gore standpoint and an adult-situation standpoint.  If you have a low tolerance for realism in film, I would steer clear.  Otherwise, put this on your To Watch list immediately.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1383177600,,2316,4.408018867924528

This is another in a long line of blatent ripoffs by modern movie-maker-wannabes who don't have enough talent to come up with something original. The original, while quite disturbing, was at least set in a beautiful vacation woodland, and for a few minutes you could forget what was about to happen and just enjoy a pretty young woman running through the woods naked. The original featured about 40 minutes of the woman being attacked, and about 20 minutes for her revenge, and left you sort of feeling like justice had prevailed. The remake starts with a ten-minute attack, and a second too-brutal attack that happens mostly off-camera. About 30 more minutes are so dark that you can't see anything, as the young kidnapped woman finds herself in some Russian sewer tunnels where she recovers and plans her revenge. Finally, her revenge is pretty much anti-climatic and never makes it to the point where you think she got even. All-in-all, this is another boring sequel by a generation of movie makers that shouldn't be allowed to tie their works to anything that came before. I watched most of this one in fast-forward and was actually happy to get off the 20 miles of bad road that is ""I Spit on Your Grave 2"" and back to a TV re-re-re-re-broadcast of the cheesy Ghost Rider.

5834380,4,B00DMUFYZQ,"*SPOILERS ahead...As if you care for this film*

There has never been a movie like this that has stirred me on some level, so I don't know if I'm just incapable of ""getting into the movie"" or whatever, but considering that rape like this almost never happens and human trafficking is *worse* than how it's portrayed here (the vast majority of rapes are done by friends of the victim, though it's almost always portrayed as a random occurrence. Second, human trafficking is not exactly a secondary aspect of rape, and generally involves kidnapping young American girls while they're on cruises and such and enslaving them around those areas. You might not care about these things, but I wish they made films about these sorts of things, even if fictionalized and just realistic.)

So, not one frame of the violence or rapes or what have you really affected me. I even laughed a few times during a couple of the torture scenes, but I was mostly disappointed at the religious themes that never develop, and the fact that the protagonist, Katie, is in almost every way identical to the first. Not even the revenge-kills are all that special or exciting. I'd even call them boring.

Since I like movies that push the envelope as hard as they can (and I've never been able to see a movie as anything but actors on a screen, so I never get scared or even grossed out--it's always just props and stages to me), movies like these are up my alley. Not bad, but not particularly good, either. Almost identical to the 2010 remake, but with a change of setting and new antagonists. Katie (wasn't the first girl called Katie, too? Or...I forget, Something Hills.) is a carbon copy of the previous anti-hero, even to the point where, during the revenge part of things, she acts practically the same way, feeding back lines to her captors and such.

I was disappointed when she emerged in the Church, began reading the Bible, but then that was the end of the significance of that. I was sort of hoping for a different theme to the killings, even a sort-of medieval, religious-history-based one. Nothing of the sort happens, sadly. Sometimes what Katie says doesn't really make sense, like when she says, ""They used to treat mental illness with shock therapy..."" They still do, you moron, just not quite the same way you were doing it (read up on ECT if you feel like being smarter than everyone else about that nightmarishly-portrayed treatment that isn't anything like how it's ever been portrayed in film, and genuinely works and is painless).

Then there's the thing with the cop dude, whatever his name was. What was the point of his character? All he does is follow her into the sewers, then does things that are astonishingly unrealistic (why the hell did he shoot the totally-unarmed and bound guy when her head is right next to his? The heck was that about? What was even the point of it, if only for the audience's sake?), and the priest's role is apparently just to mention that hey, someone might be seeking vengeance because she left that part open while she was reading the Bible.

Literally, that's it, but it was just thrown in without any follow-up. Kinda lame.

The other characters had virtually nothing to them, either. What was with that guy with the shocker? He just does his thing and we wait for him to get it served back to him. I mean, can we at least find some reason to feel something for the bad guys? Can they at least have a reason, or anything? Otherwise it just feels like a puppet show with props and a lot of fake blood. I like connecting my characters to the violence on-screen, which is what good horror/shocker films do. Even ""A Serbian Film"" had that much done with its characters.

I will admit, though, I laughed at the guy's viced-up testicles literally popping open like cracked eggs onto the floor.

Sometimes inadvertently funny, never shocking, never surpasses the original in any meaningful way. There's no reason to watch it twice; it's not like you missed anything important. Still, what a waste with the Church scene she was briefly a part of. They did literally nothing with it, and I was hoping for some sort of creativity in the revenge kills, but nope. Standard stuff, and even the same style and characters. Surprise me once, or something.",1382486400,,4277,4.669322709163347

I have no idea how you would continue the original story but it would have been nice for the title to inform us that this is a new set if characters.

It is really difficult to review a movie like this. I have no idea how tell a group of people if they will like a movie that is based around intense sexual abuse. The abuse is song ard to watch I imagine almost every viewer will be put off by it. It's hard to enjoy this movie when there is so much torture going on.

My only issue with judging this movie based on the abuse portion of the plot is that while renting this movie you should have a good idea of what you are getting into. The abuse in this just seemed to go on do long and was so rough that I did lose interest in it quickly.

Oddly enough though this movie was actually very well made. It made me uncomfortable which is usually very difficult for movies to do. Aside from all of that the rest if the plot is actually more involved than I thought it would be.

The original movies took place in an isolated wooded setting and it was nice to see that they chose metropolitan areas this time around. The setting along with the cast really brought this movie up a notch. I was very impressed with the little things they added to the plot and the lives of the side characters. They really seemed to do a lot with the small amount of material they had to work with.

This movie could be enjoyable on some unexpected levels but the abuse in it is very rough and quite off putting.",1382486400,,1751,4.090379008746356
5834382,4,B00DMUFYZQ,"The SAW, Hostel, and Texas Chainsaw movies are definitely more visceral than this.  After all is said and done, no one really messed with anyone's face (a la paring off ears, lips, eyelids, or noses). And,too,people were left (relatively)intact over-all. The gore came from internal things, mostly, but, this was certainly just as effective a terror agent.

The rape scenes were quite edited so I really cannot speak on all that this female character experienced. However, the first rape scene has pretty dodgy choreography;the guy playing the rapist reveals a fleeting glimpse of his phallus sock when he first unzips to do his nasty deed. These actors are not committed to the 'true sex for the authenticity' angle like the actors in 'Nine Songs' so that really made it less scary for me and I must admit that I was a bit relieved. Also, the janitor that the guy stabs 'has' to stare wide-eyed as Katie is being raped and life oozes out of him--allegedly, he dies staring. However,a few shots later reveal him with his eyes tightly shut. Another continuity issue.

The nudity was oddly wholesome and sterile. One is made to feel more sorry for and empathetic towards the woman versus being sexually piqued.

I like that the victim gets her revenge. She earned it. How often does that happen in horror flicks? Women need some kind of actor's union regarding the usual trashing of female characters. I think that some of the men who viewed this movie didn't like it because it pretty much eviscerated and shamed the concept of male domination and patriarchy after all was said and done.

5834386,3,B00DMUFYZQ,"First off three and a half stars.
Now I've read alot a reviews and find it kinda hilarious that people will ""put up"" with the offending rape scenes as long as she gets her revenge.
Weird.
Movies are often encouraged to reflect real life and it's not quite as karma-esque as this movie implies but yes it's great thing to look forward too.
So if I understand this logically, it's not OK to show rape scenes regardless of the outcome (or the story the movie is trying to portray) unless the person raped gets their revenge?
OK whatever.
For what this movie is, it does a decent job of making people reasonably uncomfortable.
What I really like is after that scenario with Anna? I think her name was, and the girl escapes to realize she's in another coutry/continent and wonders off into a church only to have the local priest try to help her, is the fact that you could really feel how closed off she is from ANYBODY and would not trust or want help from people she would meet regardless if they're a priest or probably even a cop.
Totally justified.
The revenge bit as others can attest is quite satisfactory ... only downside is as another reviewer put it is the girl's (sorry don't remember names- watch to many movies) voice sounded pretty funny trying to tough talk her attackers.
Just wasn't pulling it off for me.
However, I guess that would be easier to achieve if you're tied up and are fully aware of all the nasty things you've done are about to come back in your face.

Pros
+Same Director from remake
+Good Storyline IDEA

Cons
-The Revenge doesnt live up to the torture (which is a major fail in this type film)
-The girl was a terrible actress
-The bad guys were a joke, couldn't take serious.
-It plays an hour of torture, and 20 minutes of revenge.

From there the carnage doesn't subside and the film delivers hardcore.

5834395,3,B00DMUFYZQ,"It took over 25 years for someone to produce a sequel to the infamous 1970's seminal 'rape / revenge' epic: ""I Spit on Your Grave"" but barely 3 years to crank out a sequel to the sequel - which (for better or worse) says something in itself about the appeal of this particular perverse plot line to a segment of the population.

Having now viewed all 3 of the ISOYG (lord help us!) 'franchise' I would rate this most current take on the theme as a 'qualified' success. For anyone who hasn't had the 'pleasure' of experiencing the ISOYG phenom - the basic plot typically involves: a group of low life guys who horribly abuse & rape some poor sweet girl and leave her for dead - BUT - she, miraculously, resuscitates herself and returns to wreak equally horrible revenge upon her tormentors... roll credits.

The first two versions of this tale were set in some nebulous backwoods American locale (reminiscent of the inbred savagery originated in 'Deliverance') wherein the beleaguered 'writer' heroine (in both versions) is harassed by a gang of miscreant yokels. In searching for a way to 'refresh' this well worn plot the director has, this time, shifted the scene to the Big Apple (for starts) where aspiring 'model' Katie initially runs afoul of a clan of Euro-trash - then transports all of the action over to (everyone's NEW favorite creepy place) Eastern Europe - where, apparently, everyone is totally depraved and 'anything goes'! Despite the improbable aspects of transporting a girl in a box thru post 9/11 airport security so they can ship her back 'home' to Bulgaria - this plot device does add a nice extra touch of desperation to the situation.

Whereas the original ""ISOYG"" was ground-breakingly brutal in its' depiction of a harrowing-ly drawn out series of rapes - this most recent incarnation actually manages to 'up the ante' by adding a pile of heavy-duty torture porn to the mix with a decidedly sexual slant. While the indignities that this film's leading lady suffers are constructed to be so hideous that they literally cry out for righteous retribution - it does cause one to ponder about the impact & nature of the imagery presented. This is where ISOYG-2 began to remind me of the recent 'underground' horror porn sensation ""A Serbian Film"" - which also didn't 'hold back' in depicting horrific sexual violence towards women (and men!). But, where 'A Serbian Film"" made some attempt at social relevancy by (purportedly) utilizing sexual violence as an analogy to comment on the 'destruction of civil & family values in post-war Serbia' - ISOYG-2 presents similar graphic sexual violence in a more formulaic manner, merely to rationalize the vengeance factor. It is to the credit of the lead actress and director that they actually manage to make the scenes of abuse SO disgusting that it removes any sense of titillation from the premise and shows it for the horrible thing that it is. This is a fine balancing act that turns what might have devolved to a grossly misogynistic foray - into a morality play, of sorts, and sorta 'saves' the film from becoming totally revolting.

This film is MUCH stronger in its cruelty and imagery than the 2010 re-make version. There is more female nudity displayed, the torture factor is upped appreciably upon the woman, and the, kharmic-ly precise!, acts of retribution that are ultimately dished out to the detestable male abusers are just about as grim as could be imagined. In a classical Biblical format of 'eye for an eye' justice - this film really provides that satisfying cum-uppance factor that fuels the rape/revenge genre.

In the aftermath of it all though, you gotta wonder - 'Where can they go from here'?! I think this screenplay pushes the envelop about as far as you can go in the brutality department without crossing the line. If you like this sort of stuff - I'd say that this version 'delivers the goods'. Personally, I am a fan of sick & twisted cinema so I sorta enjoyed this one within the context of the ISOYG 'franchise'- BUT - I'd caution that it is pretty heavy duty stuff and Adult Only fare! The only 'extras' on the disk are some limp 'deleted scenes'.",1381276800,4,4148,4.7958041958041955

What could be scarier than this? After getting brutally gang raped, you wake up and find that you've been taken to another country? With no idea of how you've gotten there?

With no money, identification, hardly any clothes, or possessions of any kind - you'd truly feel isolated with no one to turn to for help.

I thought the acting was really good as well, especially by Jemma Dallender, the female lead.

However, the revenge sequence was just OK and only partially satisfying. I mean that's the point of these movies, isn't it? - The horrible setup, followed by a really satisfying revenge sequence (Ala ""Death Wish""). Well, the revenge sequence could have been more intricate, like the first ""I Spit on Your Grave"" remake, and played out over more time.

5834407,4,B00DMUFYZQ,"This is an EXTREMELY graphic, violent and brutal rape-torture-revenge movie.  That should be all you need to know to decide if this movie is for you or not.

So, this is a ""sequel"" but it has nothing to do with the characters from the 2010 remake.  This is simply another extremely unfortunate incident that plagues another young woman.

Katie (newcomer Jemma Dallender) is trying to make it as a model in NYC but she's not willing to go as far as her eastern European photographers advise.  When she decides to part ways with these shady photographers, one of them isn't ready to let go and takes an unhealthy interest in her.

Director Steven R. Monroe (I Spit on Your Grave) is by no means new to this type of movie, having helmed the 2010 remake.  We meet unsettling people who readily cross lines and soullessly afflict the innocent with suffering under helpless circumstances.  You watch and you feel frozen, numb, appalled...you try to imagine the horror but quickly realize you couldn't possibly.  Here, you may be telling yourself ""it's probably not so intense. I've seen rape scenes in movies before.""  Well, here a young girl is raped in front of a young man who is bleeding to death only feet away from her; the young man being her neighbor with whom she had exchanged playful invited flirtations and he was stabbed when rushing to her screaming aid only to look her in the eyes as she was violated and his blood drained from his cold body.  Not your average rape scene.

After the murder-rape, the rapist calls his sociopathic colleagues to help clean up his mess.  They drug her and take her far from home (in Bulgaria!!!!!) where she's kept as a sex slave.  Being held captive turns Katie feral, attacks one of her captors when his guard is down and escapes only to be returned to her captors by someone she thought way trying to help her.  Eventually, she is left for dead and impossibly survives.

Nudity is a tool in these movies.  It's not arousing--not even a little--nor is it meant to be.  It only magnifies Katie's vulnerability and humiliation.  It was effective.  What sadly wasn't effective was the keystone soul-crushing moment of the original and the remake: that moment when the victim escapes only to be horrifyingly reunited with her captors.  In this movie it just sort of happens and you find yourself saying ""well that sucks for her"" and that's about it.  Of course, most everything before and after this moment is still viciously cruel and intense.

When Katie exacts her revenge the fun gets started for torture film enthusiasts.  I won't ruin any of it other than to warn of some outstandingly graphic genital mutilation.  But I'll say a fine job is done with the gore, the sounds of slow cuts, and some other nasty sloppy gastrointestinal  grossness.  As usual (in all these movies),  I question how she's moving her captors' bodies when they're unconscious.  After all, she couldn't weigh over 115 pounds and looks like she's never done a push-up or sit-up; she's a delicate little thing.  But I don't let that ruin the Hostel-like fun.

The acting is good and the story is more refined than the 1978 and 2010 iterations, and this story really captures the plotting psychological nature of vengeance better than the previous two movies.  I think all three of these movies were done VERY well and all were VERY effective.  The rape is always difficult to watch and even though it's a movie I find myself wanting to punish someone for it, but I sooo love wincing and trying not to look away when the victim turns into the dark heroine to exact her revenge.",1380412800,4,3593,4.68849840255591

If you have seen any of these ""spit"" films, you know the plot.

The film gives us some quick character buildup as Katie constructs a mouse trap from household items and then moves to the violent scenes. She can easily go into and out off a berserker mode.

I loved Jemma Dallender from ""Community"" and it appears she will be stuck in the horror genre for awhile, which is great for us horror film lovers. She has conquered the American accent with ease, but did we really need the ""You Betcha"" line?

As soon as the sequel was released which wasn't too long ago, I have read and heard from other horror fans that the sequel is worth watching!

I couldn't believe I was able to watch the entire....well...there is a LONG rape scene in this movie and I have to say that it was pretty disturbing and brutal. I wasn't expecting it to be THAT long but it reminded me of the 2002 foreign classic ""irreversible"" movie which also had a deeply disturbing rape scene.  However, it is also a revenge movie as well and I don't want to spoil about what happens during that part but I will admit that I was surprised it was good and worth watching. I was totally expecting the movie to be MUCH worse and have not so original horror scenes but it's good to be proved wrong.  I can't remember the last time I saw a decent sequel to a horror movie since it has been FOREVER because there is always a sequel to a successful 1st horror movie that ends up being absolute s***.  I hope more horror directors take some notes from this sequel because this sequel was ACTUALLY worth watching! The best part is that the original director, Steven R. Monroe, who also directed the original and remake of I Spit On Your Grave, so I can see why this sequel was actually worth watching because it's the same director! So if your on the fence about renting this movie, go for it! Is it worth buying? That depends if you are a huge fan of Steven R. Monroe work, then I would say yes!
