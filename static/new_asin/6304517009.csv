7874004,5,6304517009,"I think that this is one of the most amazing (and amazingly real--whatever that means) films I have ever seen. what a brave piece of work. unflinching.  if you like Leigh at all (Naked is another masterpiece), check this VERY OBSCURE picture out.  you might weep for humanity, but it'll be cathartic for you. cheers.",1427328000,,316,4.7272727272727275
7874005,5,6304517009,"This film is certainly filled with bleak moments, and reminded me of Ingmar Bergman's films and and Woody Allen's 'Interiors'. If you like depressing films, you'll love this!",1425427200,,174,5.25
7874006,5,6304517009,"Mike Leigh's 1st feature film Bleak Moments announced a considerable talent. I don't think he ever improved on the all-round quality of acting performances,script and directing,including cinematography. Shot in Norwood,South London,it evokes a time 1970,and place,suburban streets,and a form of behaviour,which is awkwardly English, introspective,given to embarrassingly long silences of all the main characters. This film has all the quality for British cinema that new wave had for the French.

Sylvia(Anne Rait) lives with her mentally-disabled sister,Hilda(Sarah Stephenson) in their house. She loves her sister and looks out for her,bringing in gentleman callers, one an uptight schoolteacher,Peter(Eric Allan)the other a hippie guy,Norman(Mike Bradwell)who plays guitar for Hilda and keeps Sylvia company. She has loaned out her garage for him to live in and print copies of a folk music magazine. Sylvia works as a typist in an office with her colleague Pat,with a boss who is an irritating bore.

The anguish of unexpressed inner feelings,the failure of personal communication and social interaction,the isolation of the characters from each other. We are not connected to the wide world,only a shots of dark interiors cut with shots of residential streets. Hilda is isolated by her disability,yet all the characters fall short and crave experience and company. The desperate nature of their existence expressed in a social gathering, and a scene set in a Chinese restaurant. Mostly Sylvia's attempts to tempt Peter,by topping up his glass with sherry and through body language.

All the performers are 1st rate,but the film is centred on Anne Raitt's impassive,calm,measured,plaintive beauty,tempered by a stoic humour. Most bizarrely Peter attempts to converse intellectually about the medium dominating the message with Sylvia makes him blind to the real communication,and he falls flat at a kiss. Raitt has the bobbed hair of a Jane Eyre(and she plays the piano). Leigh draws out the silences,the pregnant pauses, until we get to each tortured soul. Technically perfect,tonally brilliant. Leigh has never been better. He's the film equivalent of Pinter and Larkin.",1414627200,,2176,5.60790273556231
7874007,2,6304517009,"With the exception of Topsy Turvey, which was an uncharacteristically (for Mike Leigh) colorful look at Gilbert and Sullivan), Mike Leigh usually tends to be at the top of his game when his films revolve around an interesting central character, graced by a fine performance in that central role (David Thewliss in Naked, Brenda Blethyn in Secrets And Lies, Imelda Staunton in Vera Drake, Sally Hawkins in Happy Go Lucky, etc.), or even around a more supporting character highlighted by a fine performance (Lesley Manville in Another Year). Bleak Moments (which could have more aptly been named Awkward Moments or even Dull Moments) suffers from the lack of such a central character. Anne Raitt, Eric Allan, and Mike Bradwell certainly do well in portraying the shyness and awkwardness of their characters, but these are dull people leading dull lives, which, unfortunately, adds up to a dull story and dull movie. In Roger Ebert's 1972 review of the film, he calls it a masterpiece and compares it to Eric Rohmer's My Night At Maud's. The big difference between the two films, in my opinion, is that the dialogue in Rohmer's film is intelligent and interesting. The dialogue in Bleak Moments may be natural and realistic, but it simply isn't interesting. Leigh's intention seems to have been a slice-of-life portrayal of the English working-class, but slice-of-life does not necessarily equate to compelling, let alone entertaining. If you're a fan of Mike Leigh, then you'll probably want to check it out, since this is his first film; otherwise, be warned by the title.",1340409600,2,1571,5.046153846153846
7874008,5,6304517009,"This is an utterly British film (in social norms, manners and language) that will impress you with it's sheer originality. For some portion of the film I felt a more appropriate title to be ""Uncomfortable Moments"", due to the slightest edge of humor in several scenes, though there are enough bleak ones to warrant. Many people might find this film too slow, or like me; it may move you to rapt attention, boredom, annoyance, a giggle, concern, rooting for a character, and a certain kind of discomfort that leaves you shifting in your seat. Afterward you may feel compelled to have a long conversation with another human being, just to reassure that it is indeed possible, and you may certainly entertain some quiet reflection. Once I realized what this film was doing I quickly imagined how the scene would play a time or two; just to ease the feeling that each character's desire which passed unmet, left me as frustrated as those on screen. With no traditional soundtrack to speak of I found each musical moment from the characters rather uplifting in it's honesty, in a film that emphasizes how words often convey but the slightest hint of what was meant to be said. Though Bleak Moments may not be for everyone, for those it moves, it could be quite amazing. If nothing else this is a film for film's sake; and I can only imagine that it must have had an influence on the whole Dogma 95 crew for it's starkly honest portrayal of everyday life. Any aspiring director who admires the slice of life genre or any aspiring actor who wants to see superb performances of tragically real characters that pull you to the edge of your seat, and needle you to bury your face in your hands; needs to see this.",1141516800,2,1703,4.605263157894737
7874009,2,6304517009,"BLEAK MOMENTS was rather disappointing. After hearing raves (from Ebert and others) for years about this early Leigh film, I finally rented the DVD and...to my utter surprise, I could NOT get through it - usually, I am hypnotized by Leigh's mastery of pace, tone, and character, but here, it's really tough going - a long, static, dull, uninvolving slog - all the ""quirky"" behavior just gets tiresome - one to possibly admire in theory/hindsight once you know Leigh's work, but as a film to stand on its own, you're much better of starting with SECRETS & LIES, ALL OR NOTHING, LIFE IS SWEET, VERA DRAKE, or even ABIGAIL'S PARTY...anything but BLEAK MOMENTS which is..er...um...rather bleak.",1139875200,4,690,4.956896551724138
