7801432,1,1930887345,"As a pilot, I had read Mr. Machado's private pilot book and use it for leisure referance.  I thought this may be a good tape in improving and maintaining a safe attitude in flying earlier in my piloting.  Mr. Machado's technigue in making a point may be well intended but fails.  As usual, Mr. Machado tries to be a good lecturer/flight instructor and comdeian but accomplishes neither.  He is long winded and overdoes everything.  I found this production useless since I already practice what he preaches.  The sound qaulity on this video is poorly recorded and difficult to discern at times.  The tape caused my VCR to jam.  Mr. Machado overdoes this production as he does his private pilot book with over simplification.  I would not recommend this tape at all",1039392000,4,763,4.763358778625954
