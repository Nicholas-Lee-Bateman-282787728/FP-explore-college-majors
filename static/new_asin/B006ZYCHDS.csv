8507336,5,B006ZYCHDS,"This is a great workout, with abs and stretch about 70 minutes long but shorter premixes. I used much lighter weights and am a very high intermediate level and I worked up a great sweat with this. It is not, though, really low impact, and more choreographed than newer workouts so harder to get on the first run through a combo. But this is a very good workout.",1512518400,,361,4.323529411764706
8507337,5,B006ZYCHDS,"This is a fun challenging workout...recommended for all levels. I am an advanced exerciser, who worked up quite a sweat doing this DVD. Sharon Twombly is a great instructor, who uses upbeat music and fun moves to work the entire body. The weights in this particular DVD are not heavy but used in concert with challenging the core, produce excellent results. Exercise is definitely the key to aging gracefully and well. I am 62 and have missed maybe 5 days of exercise since turning 20. Trust me..you'll love this DVD.",1453248000,,517,4.7555555555555555
8507338,4,B006ZYCHDS,"This is a brisk-paced, low-impact, cardio sculpting workout.  Sharon is an energetic instructor who cues very well.  The entire workout is 60 minutes, but shorter pre-mixes ranging from 26-40 minutes are available.  The combinations are taught add-on style and build gradually. 2lb hand weights are used for faster tempo segments (shuffles, grapevines, mambos) and 5lb hand weights for slower sculpting segments (usually compound movements incorporating shallow squats, lunges, side bends).  She sprinkles in some optional jumps to boost intensity, but low-impact modifications are always provided.  It wraps up with 7 minutes of core toning.  Good intermediate-advanced workout that will creep up on you.  Generates a nice sweat without compromising the joints.  Upbeat music. A good DVD for one's fitness rotation.",1388880000,,816,5.741666666666666
