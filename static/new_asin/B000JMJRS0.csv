He would be peeved I'd beat him to the video machine so he'd loudly talk over the music about how the guy was a terrible singer/that guy can't sing/he's not really playing that/it's not a real guitar... you get the idea.

Luckily he was totally wrong - Joe Lynne Turner CAN sing and despite his narrow musical palette Malmsteen is a brilliant shredder. The number of hours I spent as a teenager listening to his stuff and watching the videos is a bit scary - perhaps more time studying would have been a good idea huh? But anyway, I was stoked to find this on DVD nowadays and so here are some of my thoughts specific to the DVD release (I've previously reviewed the VHS version).

#1  The transfer, to my eyes, seems fine. The original wasn't a spectacular show as Malmsteen is the first to admit he has a fairly traditional approach to stage presentation. The audio hasn't been remastered as far as I know which I guess is a missed opportunity but to have the original document just available in this format is nice.

#2  There is no booklet.... Well that is a lie. There is a booklet but it's all in Japanese so unless you can speak the lingo of the land of the rising sun you won't get much out of it.

#3  The menu is easily navigable and the bonus features really are a bonus. No silly backstage shenanigans but instead you score yourself a bunch of promo clips. This is pretty cool as you didn't see many Malmsteen clips on DVD for much of his career. You Don't Remember, I'll Never Forget/Heaven Tonight/Bedroom Eyes/Making Love/Save Our Love are all here and while it's a bit weird givien three of them are songs written for the later Eclipse album I'll take `em where I can get `em. It must be said however that you could also just score yourself the YJ Malmsteen Collection thingy and get the whole story up to that same point.

Overall it's great to see one of the 80's premier shred kings in fine fettle. Yes his overblown stage moves may induce hurling, yes the way the guitarist essentially gets the limelight as opposed to the singer may seem weird, yep the stage show is mediocre at best at the time of writing... but who cares? A range of awesome songs are trotted out, the band of Barry Dunaway, the Anders brothers and Mr Turner is quality and when you think that Yngwie played to almost 250,000 people during the course of this tour which was done at a time when the Iron Curtain was still shut this is a pretty cool document for any shred heads collection and given the greater depth of material he had to draw from it's probably a more rounded and polished bunch of tunes that his first live video.",1263859200,6,2773,4.3604651162790695
8152185,5,B000JMJRS0,"i have been searching, hope-ing & praying for many years for a DVD copy of the complete VHS classic Malmsteen w/ Joe Lynn Turner & Rising Force video ""Live in Lenningrad"" & FINALLY i found one !!! no only did i find what i was looking for but it is an exceptionally well-produced Japanese import w/ crystal clear sound & video !!! & includes such extras as 5 promo videos [Bedroom Eyes, Heaven Tonight, Making Love, Save Our Love & You Don't Remember, I'll Never Forget] as well as other ""masterclass"" tidbits... this DVD was obviously American made for the Japanese market [all the type on DVD & DVD cover is in English w/ a Japenese language insert] & the attention to details on the DVD & even the DVD cover are extremely well thought out & tastefully presented... why this DVD has not been released in the American market remains a mystery to me [legal complications ???] as i'm quite certain it would sell to every Malmsteen fan who owns a DVD player... to my tastes, this concert was the absolute recorded pinnacle, so far, of Malmsteen's playing, performing, composition & his best band PLUS the extras are, for my tastes, from his most creative years... this is without a doubt one of my all-time favorite DVDs & i whole-heartedly recommend that you find a copy- if you can !!! i paid $40- for this import copy & hope you are as fortunate ! i am a card-carrying member of Malmsteen's fan club & admire Yngwie's ""middle period"" music as some of my favorite electric guitar inspiration & this DVD is the best souvenir you'll ever find of that era of his on-going career !!!
