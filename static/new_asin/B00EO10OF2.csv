5929317,3,B00EO10OF2,"Don't ask how I have the Blu-Ray already!  The only good thing about this film was the excellent picture quality and the fact that they at least made the actors resemble the actual people.  The picture quality was great and it showed 1963 technology (I was not there) in vivid HD!  I had the opportunity to see the old cars, clothes and electronics as they would have been (I assume) if I had been there.  When you see these things in black in white, it looks even older!  THIS part of the film was great.

Now, as far as the film itself goes - anything based on parrot Vincent Buigliosi and his constant protection of a coup, is bound to have the usual story (Oswald did it and he was low down, but the government is great) and the usual ways.  This film was not even needed, but was made to reinforce the hoax of Oswald killing JFK for the 50th anniversary of JFK's death.  The film makers claim that they are not dealing with conspiracy theories, but they made sure to project people who promoted conspiracy in a bad light.

From her first appearance, Margaret Oswald was made too look like a lunatic talking about Lee Oswald having been a government agent on a secret mission.  Her other son, Robert, rebukes her and gives the audience (not much of one since this film flopped!) the impression that she is a nut and he is the straight laced one telling it like it was.  They made HIM a hero while disrespecting his mother and brother.  I wonder why we never hear about John Pic (Oswald's other brother) in these films?

Well, they made Oswald's mother seem concerned with money from writing a book (she did release an album to make money as she was shut out from employment) and her continued claims that Lee was a government agent.  Of course with all of the 'secret agent' films over the decades, when people hear that someone was an 'agent' they think super spy and that unless the government confirmed it, anyone making such claims are sick.  They made Margaret look like a fool throughout the movie.  She was the contrary.  You know mothers know their children and want to protect them.  She was clear in his work for the government.  The guy WAS a Marine and JFK was in the Navy, which commands the Marines, so Oswald was a government agent!  Of course whatever else he was into, only his mother could speculate, but she divulged more than any government source, but they could not kill the man's mother, it would look suspicious.  His stay in the Soviet Union was clearly the actions of an agent for a deep cover story.  I have my strong theories how he got picked for a patsy, but I might write a book!

Lastly, there was more subjective subliminal stuff in the film as in the scene where Zapruder was talking to a Life Magazine rep.  Zapruder stated: ""I was not filming a WAR, I filmed a murder!""  That was an interesting line there.  It seemed designed to guide the audiences thoughts away from coup, as a coup is WAR.  Calling it a simple murder is there way of trying to convey that Oswald did it and he alone, for reason unknown and no one cares why.

This was a film that was unneeded as it did not add anything new, but if you want to get an idea of the events in color, then it is worth seeing for that, not for the real deal on the killing.  It cost $10M to make and only made $600K.  No one cared about this film.  This film does not care about the truth either.",1382400000,7,3384,4.340764331210191
5929318,1,B00EO10OF2,"Wow. How low can they sink? What a mess. But never intended to be a hit, this film was designed to get another Warren Commission film out into the zeitgeist. It had no intention of making money. Multiple threads are followed to dismiss facts uncovered by fierce critics of the Commission. My favorite technique used is how the director/writer Peter Landesman, who has the ""fingerprints of intelligence"" all over this current and previous journalism works, refuses to show the full, though brief Zapruder film - this is because he does not want the audience to see the President going ""back and to the left"" from frontal wound. Also, removed is Doctor Charles Crenshaw - poof! Removed like Stalin would do! Dr. Zac Efron places a trache tube in the President's throat and Dr. Perry (Tom Hank's son) asks what he is doing he tells him he's done a tracheotomy to the wound - not the ""entrance"" wound as discussed.
FBI Agent Hosty and his boss are depicted with more lies than can be imagined. Plot insists the entire conspiracy the world has come to know regarding the Kennedy murder is merely the result of the FBI trying to hide the Oswald note left by him at FBI HQ days before the assassination. All of this is by design. There is no shoddy errors of omission in this film. They are errors of commission. In other words, all deviations from the truth are subtle and involve facts uncovered and already established by fifty years of deep research.
No words from Marina? No life rights.
Oswald says about 100 words in the film as is depicted as a snotty dick.

5929319,2,B00EO10OF2,"The date November 22, 1963, is one of the darkest days in American history.  On this particular day, the United States was thrust into a tailspin when an assassin's bullet struck down President John F. Kennedy while he was riding in his motorcade through the streets of Dallas, Texas.  As if the tragedy of this day weren't horrific enough, the JFK assassination is also one of the most heavily analyzed events because of the sudden disarray the government experienced - never mind the possibility of a massive cover-up.  Naturally, the series of events in Dallas has prompted the creation of several Hollywood productions, including JFK, Executive Action, and In the Line of Fire.  Most of those films focus on the assassination directly, but there really hasn't been a film that focuses on the individuals that played an essential role in trying to save JFK and protect his body after his death - until now.  In the new film, Parkland - the doctors and the video tape that documented the assassination take center stage.

Based on the book Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy by Vincent Bugliosi and directed by Peter Landesman, Parkland stars Paul Giamatti as Abraham Zapruder, the man that videotaped the assassination of John F. Kennedy.  Word quickly spreads that someone had the events on camera, prompting Secret Service Agent Forrest Sorrels (Billy Bob Thornton) to have it quickly developed.  At the same time, JFK's body was transported to Parkland Hospital where the doctors on staff, including Dr. Jim Carrico (Zac Efron) and Dr. Malcom O. Perry (Colin Hanks), attempted to save the president's life.  Following the president's death, the Secret Service controversially reclaim the body and move to return the yet to be sword in Vice President, Lyndon B. Johnson, to Washington D.C.  Tom Welling, Mark Duplass, Jacki Weaver, James Badge Dale, and Jackie Earle Haley also star in supporting roles.

While I'm a diehard lover of history, there's just something about most history films that always leave a bad taste in my mouth.  The abundance of history flicks is usually a good thing (as far as the entertainment value goes) and if they help get more people interested in history, that's great.  Films about history figures, like Abraham Lincoln, are always interesting because he was never documented on video.  My beef is with films, like Parkland and W., that depict events that don't require a Hollywood production.  For instance, George W. Bush is alive and well, and most everything he ever did in office is quickly interpreted in a mere two hours in W.  What's the point?  Everything the man has done is basically on camera for anyone to watch on YouTube or through various media outlets.  The same goes for the JFK assassination, especially since there is an abundance of documentaries - some presenting the facts and others full of conspiracy theories, that chronicles the events of his assassination.  My point here is that many of the real life people, including Abraham Zapruder and Dr. Malcom O. Perry, are all on record depicting their version of events.  There's no need to create (at this point in time) a seemingly pointless reproduction using famous actors to depict already well-documented events.

Parkland attempts to bite off more than it can chew, often throwing a ton of brutally important information at you in a short amount of time.  It follows several different plot lines, including the Zapruder tape, JFK's trip to the hospital, Lee Harvey Oswald's brother and mother, and a handful of Secret Service members.  And, the worst part about all of it is the fact that each of these subjects, which have books written about them on their own, are terribly minimized - while other subjects, like the possibility of a different shooter other than Oswald, is completely trivialized.  More often than not, Parkland lacks a driving point and a clear cut message.  Sure, the film has its facts in order, but it would appear this film's only goal was to show the expressions of people's faces during this devastating day.  I don't know about you, but Zac Efron looking at JFK's body lying lifeless on a table doesn't exactly ""move"" me.

In some scenes, more than others, the emotion of the situation is understandably devastating - especially when JFK is lying on a hospital bed as doctors and officials look on helplessly.  There no actor on this planet that could fully encompass the emotions that were flowing on this day.  Still, standing out in this star-studded cast is Paul Giamatti, who is no stranger to historical character acting.  He masterfully portrayed former U.S. President John Adams in an HBO miniseries, and does an equally superb job here as the emotionally distraught and highly conflicted Abraham Zapruder.  James Badge Dale is also quite captivating as Lee Harvey Oswald's brother, Robert.  Dale, along with Jacki Weaver as Marguerite Oswald, brings an interesting dynamic to the screen - showing the reaction of Lee's family members.  Needless to say, the cast is mostly enjoyable, but because of the nature of this story, there really is no main character.

In my opinion, you shouldn't need to watch a Hollywood production for modern historical knowledge.  Even though this film coincides with the 50th anniversary of the event, the history of the JFK assassination is heavily documented and now chronicled in-depth by using a minute by minute recap of what was happening.  In any event, Parkland gives attention to individuals that aren't typically in the limelight, focusing on the actions of the doctors, casual observers, along with members of the Oswald family.  Obviously, the portrayed characters of this film play substantial roles in the post-assassination history, making the film a moderately moving experience for those looking to reflect on that day.  In that regard, Parkland is very conventional at times, but the clear goal of this film was obviously to reenact and modernize a tragedy for a new generation.  The problem with that is the various history channels on cable television still do a better job of sharing these events.

5929321,3,B00EO10OF2,"This film recaps apparently randomly selected excerpts from the Kennedy assassination and its immediate aftermath. It presents no additional facts, provides no new insight, raises no new theories and has no particular frame of reference. The only question raised is why the film was made. There is a plethora of film and print treatments of this historical event. This film adds absolutely nothing to the canon. If I were a more cynical person, I would have to conclude that it is mere exploitation. Despite the excellent cast, the film goes nowhere. After viewing it, I wondered what happened to the second half of the movie. It felt like an extended trailer.",1382054400,6,660,4.954954954954955
5929322,3,B00EO10OF2,"These movies clearly suggest that there is no interest in the true assassin (s) of our fallen President in 1963. I know because I have introduced myself to various members of the media about the very real possibility of me being in the equation. I provided support with documents.

Introduced myself as part of the JFK assassination equation with supporting papers that were at the very least compelling enough to print. Did this to make money. The shoe of fortune fit. And I thought riches are/were afoot. I had no emotional interest in who killed JFK. Just financial drive.

The lousy Kennedys knew of me at the time of JFK's assassination and let me rot under a police mantel of lies and surveillance with the accompanying telephone company dialogues and show business trash acting on the screen. From these roots the WorldTrdeCenter ashes  rose on 9-1-1 the police emergency telephone number but the country calls it 9/11. How sickening is that?

Will see Parkland when it is released to home theater. There will be some kind of reference to me in the film. It is much symbolism and very much subliminal.

Voice polygraphs have existed for scores of years. They are better known as voice stress analyzers. They can do a scan on Oswald in the court house. Ruby murders Oswald on network TV- how bogus. The federal government is pathetic. So that caisson can keep rolling along.",1382054400,2,1380,4.781512605042017
5929323,1,B00EO10OF2,"This Tom Hanks-produced drama died a miserable, choking death at the theatrical box office when it opened in late-2013 - quite an achievement for a film about the Kennedy assassination released just a short period of time before the 50th anniversary of same - and was hastily released on DVD and Blu-Ray just a handful of weeks later.  PARKLAND is based on prior written works by Vincent Bugliosi, the Warren Commission apologist who attempted to convince the public of Lee Harvey Oswald's guilt over 1648 pages in RECLAIMING HISTORY, and who later released the same thesis abridged by a third under the title FOUR DAYS IN NOVEMBER: THE ASSASSINATION OF JOHN F. KENNEDY.  In either format Bugliosi - a talented writer of other creditable works such as THE PROSECUTION OF GEORGE W. BUSH FOR MURDER - essentially mounts a lawyers brief that spends as much time angrily excoriating `conspiracy theorists' as it does detailing the supposed guilt of the young, out-of-his-depth, covert intelligence agent patsy Lee Harvey Oswald.  A hefty, millennial counterweight to the much derided CASE CLOSED, Bugilosi's thesis was a desperate attempt to reinforce the long discredited conclusions of the Warren Commission after books such as Sylvia Meagher's ACCESSORIES AFTER THE FACT (among many others) had demolished the Commission's findings, and Geraldo Rivera's 1975 TV screening of the Zapruder film had revealed the true nature of the killing to the American public. (Bugliosi's verbose but heavily distorted treatment of evidence and logic was thrown into bold relief on an episode of Jesse Ventura's CONSPIRACY THEORY, when Bugliosi - keen to `debunk' the detailed testimony and evidence that all suggests Oswald maintained ties to the Central Intelligence Agency - begged that the cameras be turned off as soon as Ventura mentioned the name George DeMohrenschildt.  For reference, DeMohrenschildt's own tale - linked to the CIA, a helpful pal to Oswald, and found dead of a shotgun blast the same day that chief investigator Gaeton Fonzi was set to interview DeMohrenschildt for the House Select Committee on Assassinations - is detailed in Joan Mellen's fascinating OUR MAN IN HAITI: GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT AND THE CIA IN THE NIGHTMARE REPUBLIC).

PARKLAND tells the story of the JFK assassination through the eyes of various figures that were ancillary to the event.  There are members of the Parkland hospital staff (Zac Efron, Marcia Gay Harden and Colin Hanks) where Kennedy's body was taken for a botched autopsy.  Lucky amateur cameraman Abraham Zapruder (Paul Giamatti) is shown capturing the film of the century prior to the footage being spirited away from public view by a purchase from LIFE magazine.  Figures from the FBI (Ron Livingstone and David Harbour) and the Secret Service (Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Welling) do their best to cope after the event with the results of a marked reduction in Presidential motorcade security.  Meanwhile, the mother (Jackie Weaver) and brother (James Badge Dale) of the chosen patsy prepare for their roles in the numbing media onslaught of post-assassination propaganda organized in part by right-wing media heiress Claire Booth Luce - the wife of LIFE magazine publisher Henry Luce - the latter occurring just a short while after Claire Booth had generously provided financial support to the anti-Castro Cuban covert action squad / hit team Alpha 66.  (The Alpha 66 group of covert mercenaries, conceived for the purpose of political assassination and overseen by CIA case officer David Atlee Phillips, would eventually despise Kennedy following the President's perceived lack of support to their comrades in warfare during the Bay of Pigs invasion.  David Atlee Phillips would himself work with David Morales, the chief of operations at the CIA's JM/WAVE station in Miami, and a participant in the CIA's secretive ZR/RIFLE assassination program aimed at removing Castro and other figures inconvenient to the CIA, the Pentagon and their cohorts in big business.  Alpha 66 leader Antonio Veciana would later testify to HSCA Committee members of seeing Phillips - who was known to him at the time as `Maurice Bishop' - in conversation with Lee Harvey Oswald in August 1963, twelve weeks before the Kennedy assassination.  David Morales would posthumously be quoted by friend Ruben Carbajal of concluding an angry night of bitter drinking with a final, quiet statement about the late President: ""Well, we took care of that SOB, didn't we?"")

PARKLAND director Peter Landesman tries to evoke an occasional sense of docudrama verisimilitude through the use of Paul Greengrass cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, but viewers who found themselves riveted by the bold, confident, Academy Award-winning technical expertise shown throughout Oliver Stone's JFK two decades prior are highly unlikely to find PARKLAND a sufficient replacement.  I was unconvinced by PARKLAND's drama - Landesman is a first-time director and much of the film resembles a well-cast but mediocre TV movie - and ultimately suspicious of its motives.  The events in Dealey Plaza are expansively, perhaps hypnotically, shown in Oliver Stone's JFK, but are omitted entirely in PARKLAND.  (Tellingly, Landesman also omits the moment from the Zapruder film that shows Kennedy's head violently moving backwards after being hit by a bullet from the front, perhaps realizing that audiences reminded of that visual fact might thereafter have more important things on their mind than his banal efforts at drama).  In keeping with the film's awkward and misguided tone, Australian actress Jackie Weaver was seemingly directed to portray the tragic character of Oswald's mother Marguerite in the spirit of lunatic high comedy.  All up, Landesman's alternately trite and coarse treatment of the material - material which should be gripping, regardless of whichever perspective the film took on the overall notion of a possible conspiracy - made it no surprise that his movie played to largely empty theaters.

There are a variety of works that viewers should investigate to learn more about the events of November 22nd, 1963.  While Oliver Stone's film JFK is markedly superior in dramatic quality, historic import and emotional impact to PARKLAND, the heavily annotated accompanying screenplay JFK: THE BOOK OF THE FILM also remains available on Amazon and is well worth reading. James W. Douglass's JFK AND THE UNSPEAKABLE is now the beneficiary of hundreds of positive Amazon reviews, the best of which attest to its ability to impart convincing detail and tragic historical data to the saga of Kennedy's murder.  Philip H. Melanson's SPY SAGA (sadly only available on Amazon marketplace) thoroughly covers the background of Lee Harvey Oswald as a CIA asset.  Hinckle and Turner's DEADLY SECRETS documents the CIA's use throughout the period of anti-Castro mercenaries for covert activities, including the unscrupulous murder of political figures that evidently stood in the way of the Pentagon's pursuit of war for profit.  Gaeton Fonzi's THE LAST INVESTIGATION (just now reissued in a fine hardback edition through Skyhorse Publishing) recounts the abortive House Select Committee on Assassinations inquiry from the mid 70's, and Gerald D. McKnight's BREACH OF TRUST studies the dubious machinations of the Warren Commission after the event.  Two final recommendations offer a unique perspective on both PARKLAND the film, and on President Kennedy's murder.  James DiEugenio's RECLAIMING PARKLAND is an engrossing, gloves-off critical dissection of the making of PARKLAND the movie, the CIA's recent, ongoing engagement with Hollywood studios for propaganda purposes, and the distortions found throughout Bugliosi's misleading source volume RECLAIMING HISTORY.  (One fact of particular interest - David Atlee Phillips, the dubious CIA figure mentioned above, had personally commissioned Bugliosi to write a book defending the official government story of the assassination).  Finally, Walt Brown, the author of earlier JFK assassination books such as THE PEOPLE VS LEE HARVEY OSWALD and TREACHERY IN DALLAS, has recently released the longest, most forensically detailed JFK assassination study in history, a multi-volume series of books entitled the MASTER CHRONOLOGY OF THE JFK ASSASSINATION.  All of the volumes are worth reading, (individual books cover the Kennedy administration, the life of the Warren Commission, and the decades of research and enquiry - including the Garrison trial and HSCA investigation - that eventuated thereafter), but the second major volume - titled `DEATH', and available right now on Amazon in ebook form - covers the events shown in PARKLAND, and the whole weekend of the assassination, in devastating detail with a compelling amount of accompanying analysis across more than a thousand pages.  All the above works will tell you more about the Kennedy assassination than PARKLAND, a miserable excuse for a movie that would have fared better with everyone if it had simply attempted to pursue the truth.

5929324,3,B00EO10OF2,"""Parkland,"" released shortly in advance of the 50th anniversary of the assassination of JFK (whose White House codename was ""Lancer""), is a depiction of the events in Dallas surrounding the shooting, based upon Vincent Bugliosi's book ""Four Days In November.""  That book was in turn taken from the factual background portion of Bugliosi's much longer book that argued Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination.  So going in, this is a work that is based on the known facts of the assassination, without getting into any of the conspiracy theories.  (If you want to see a movie drenched in that topic, watch Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" instead).  Leaving aside ""JFK"" and the various TV documentaries and miniseries, I don't think there has been a straightforward major movie depiction of the events in Dallas like this before.  While movie critics have not been enthusiastic about ""Parkland,"" I thought that it was very good, even if there are portions of it that could have been better.

The movie is mainly focused on some of the surrounding characters, such as the doctors and staff at Parkland hospital in Dallas (where both JFK and Oswald were taken after being shot),  Abraham Zapruder (who famously filmed the shooting of JFK), Forrest Sorrels (the local secret service agent in Dallas), and Oswald's brother and mother.  For the most part, the actors all do a very good job and the film is well done,  with some historical TV clips included to help move the narrative along and set the proper context.  Billy Bob Thornton, as Forrest Sorrels, and the actor portraying Oswald's brother Robert in particular turn in fine performances.  The director included some nice visuals, such as the scene in which the Zapruder film reflects in the glasses of one of those watching the initial screening of the film, rather than showing it directly.  The movie also captures the deep sense of grief and sadness many experienced following JFK's death.

The main complaint of many of the critical reviews that I have read is that the movie is somewhat scattered and unfocused.  I had read ""Four Days in November"" a couple of years ago, and also recently read William Manchester's ""The Death of a President,"" the large and well known book commissioned by the Kennedy family about the assassination.  While most people probably know the basic facts of the assassination, I found that was it helpful to have recently read about the events in order to keep up with the quickly moving story.  I would say, however, that especially compared to Manchester's sprawling account of the same events,  which covers the reactions of a huge number of Kennedy family members, associates, and friends, ""Parkland"" actually seems fairly narrow and focused.  The reality is that a large number of people were involved in the main events, so virtually any depiction of the events as a whole is going to have to address that fact.  The introductory minutes of the movie probably contribute to the critics' complaints, as the movie has barely gotten started before the President is already riding through downtown Dallas and Zapruder is filming the shooting.  A little more introduction and set up would have been helpful and avoided the rushed feeling at the start, and there actually is some interesting background about why the trip to Dallas was even necessary that could have been expanded upon.  The actor playing Lee Harvey Oswald is pretty effective in a  surprisingly limited number of scenes in the movie, and some of his known actions right before the shooting (and after) could have also been included.  With the movie running only about 90 minutes, it easily could have been expanded for those items.

The other often cited complaints of the critics relate to the casting of Zac Efron as one of the Parkland doctors and the over the top characterization of Oswald's mother.  I agree Efron was probably not the best choice for the role, but he certainly provides a determined and appropriately somber effort in his role.  As to Oswald's mother, from the accounts that I have read, she in fact was pretty much as depicted here and really made many of the outrageous claims and comments used in the movie, so I don't think the movie should be faulted for that.

Similarly, some critics have complained about the passage where Billy Bob Thornton, as agent Forrest Sorrels, says ""this was not supposed to happen.""  Sure, it sounds trite, but Manchester's book makes clear that virtually all of the Kennedy administration went into deep grief and shock in the days after the assassination, and many said and did odd things in the aftermath.  ""This was not supposed to happen"" is of course not an eloquent statement, but it is probably the kind of thing that was actually being said by the agents at the time.

Overall, despite the critical reviews, I thought the movie was very well done, if a little overly compressed.  (I would give it 3 and one-half stars if possible).  Maybe someday there will be an extended director's cut available, which I think would be more effective.",1381276800,81,5057,4.892145369284877
5929325,4,B00EO10OF2,"""Parkland"" (2013 release; 93 min.) brings the story of the events surrounding John F. Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on November 22, 1963. The movie doesn't waste any time and in the initial scenes we get to briefly meet the various players who'd become intimately involved in the events of that day: the Secret Service guys, the FBI guys, the accidental witnesses to the assassination, the doctors and nurses at Parkland Memorial Hospital, and of course the President and his immediate entourage. The initial 15 min. or so of the movie make ample use of the archive footage that exists from JFK's visit to Forth Worth and Dallas. After being shot, the President is taken to Parkland, where a young doctor (played by Zac Efron) at first is overwhelmed with the task at hand, and then gives his all in trying to save the President's life. A couple of major story lines eventually emerge: Abraham Zapruder (played by Paul Giamatti) films the entire sequence of events with his new 8 mm camera, and quickly gets inundated by the media to get that footage; even more interesting for me is the story line involving Robert Oswald, brother of Lee Harvey, dealing with the fall-out of being associated with/family of the killer of the US President.

Couple of comments: next month marks the 50th commemoration of JFK's assassination and while we all know pretty much what happens, this movie does shed some interesting perspectives on what happened immediately after the assassination, including at Parkland. Other than the (sporadic) scenes with Zac Efron, Paul Giamatti or Billy Bob Thornton (as the head of the Dallas Secret Service), the cast is made up of unknowns (for me anyway), and that plays out very well as it gives a more authentic feel to the movie. The use of the historic footage adds as well (at some point, one of the TV reporters (Sam Donaldson perhaps?) sums up that fateful day as ""too much, too ugly, and too fast"" and how true that is. It may very well be that America lost its innocence that day.

Imagine my surprise when out of the blue and without any pre-release hype or advertising this movie showed up this week at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati.

5929333,5,B00EO10OF2,"Parkland, 2013 Film

On November 22, 1963 President John F. Kennedy visited Dallas Texas with his wife Jacqueline. This story is based on the true events that took place that day and the next three days. They show scenes from Parkland Memorial Hospital, and the FBI headquarters in Dallas. Abraham Zapruder films the motorcade on the highway. There are shots! The hospital is notified. The body is placed on a stretcher and rushed to the Emergency Room. The Man has been hit! Doctors are summoned stat! We see them treat the patient. The lumbar brace is removed. The FBI request Zapruders film. JFK has Addisons disease. The doctors continue to work on JFK. They call it at 1PM. The widow grieves. We need a coffin. Walter Cronkite tells the news: the President is dead. The Last Rites are given. [Note how the red blood has turned black through oxidation.] they report a 24-year old man was arrested as a suspect. Oswalds brother hears the news. The FBI has been tracking Oswald for 18 months.

The Zapruder film is processed in Dallas. Whats on it? A coffin is brought to the hospital and filled. The Texas Medical Examiner wants to autopsy the body, its the law in Texas. There is a conflict, the Feds take the coffin away to the airplane. Robert talks to his mother, who says Lee was recruited by the Government. Lee H. Oswald denies shooting anyone. The FBI learns Oswald visited their office. Robert talks to his brother in jail. Lee says don't believe the so-called evidence. Officials view the Zapruder film and see the shooting. [What can be deduced from it?] How much of the film should be shown? On Sunday, Oswald was shot in the basement of the Dallas police headquarters! Oswalds family is guarded in a motel. The doctors work on Oswald but cant revive him. He won't talk now. Will the FBIs records be destroyed? There will be no trial now. Lee is buried in a simple ceremony with few people in attendance.

This movie is based on the book Reclaiming History by Vincent Bugliosi. It is like a documentary that gives the facts without getting involved in the controversies. Its better that way. The killing of Oswald while in police custody was a sign of somethings wrong. In 1974 the book The Assassination Tapes provided objective evidence for doubting the lone gunman theory. Congress began an investigation and concluded two gunmen were shooting based on recorded sounds from that time. Most people believe there was a conspiracy. Perhaps Oliver Stones JFK is the best explanation given the lack of anything better. There are many books published that offer solutions, your public library has many. The Dark Side of Camelot by Seymour Hersh revealed a lot of facts that were kept secret from the American people. JFKs personal life did not match the perceptions of the public. Dr. Charles A. Crenshaws book says JFK was shot twice from the front, he saw the results.",1513641600,,2882,4.748502994011976

This film is excellent on many levels. The kindness that was shown to the remnants of the Oswald family by the people patched together to bury Lee Harvey Oswald was of a special human beauty and dignity in contrast to the effort made to address a nation in deep mourning as the JFK funeral was happening simultaneously.  The difference between an ER in 1963 and ones we know now 45 years later is something to see.  The camera work is skillful and reflects the technology available during that era.

JFK was assassinated when I was a senior in high school and this film was a worthwhile visitation of that time.  Wishing that the Lee Harvey Oswald file had not been destroyed by the feds, as it was a short sighted and self serving decision to do so.",1510185600,3,987,4.461111111111111

5929346,5,B00EO10OF2,"This is an excellent movie, but it isn't your typical film, and certainly not your typical ""Kennedy Assassination"" film.  It doesn't spend a lot of time developing characters' backstories, and does not use an elaborate, complex script.  Instead, it simply lets the events themselves tell the story in real time.  The audience joins the story almost in voyeuristic fashion.  It's a style that works well for this subject.  It is definitely a film for people who have done some research of that awful day, and the small details will be appreciated by those who are familiar with the subject matter.  It doesn't elaborate on things, it just lays them out there. But if you haven't done much research on the Kennedy Assassination, don't let that stop you from seeing this film.  This movie can be your introduction, and although it may leave you with more questions than it answers,  they are questions you never would have thought to ask had you not seen this film.  A great deal relies on the ability of each actor to convey the emotion, anger, stress, sadness, and humanity of each scene. This incredible cast rose to the occasion and did this difficult subject material justice.  The movie is packed with big names, yet none dominate the film.  It's not a film where one or two big stars carry the movie, but rather a movie where everyone is in a supporting cast role.

And every news magazine known to man wanting to pay for the film, The other person is Robert Oswald, the brother of the man who killed Kennedy. We meet his crazy mother, quite insane, but we never learn the real story behind the murder. The FBI man in Dallas who was tracking Oswald because of his ties to Russia is revealed.

Many of the main witnesses and officials are dead, and a film like this is designed to support the lie. There was a very big reason to remove the body from Parkland, and that was the cornerstone of the cover up. The autopsy had to be controlled in order to push the single shooter theory. Oswald and many others were tied to to CIA and that is a problem...a big one. He was a ""patsy"" and this murder was committed from the inside to stop a President that did not want to promote the new world order.

5929366,4,B00EO10OF2,"""Parkland"" is the 2013 film by Peter Landesman regarding the aftermath of the assassination of President Kennedy.  It is an intense work (particularly the first half), peopled by fine performances.  It was especially satisfying too see Gil Bellows in the role of David Powers.  Jeremy Strong is perhaps the finest of cinematic incarnations of Lee Harvey Oswald, since he is inscrutable and somewhat fey.

Also of interest is the portrayal of Abraham Zapruder's growing horror at the realization of what he had on his home-movie camera.

How does ""Parkland"" compare to the best-known film regarding the assassination?

It was the loss of JFK as told through the hospital in a sense.  After the part in the film where JFK dies, I was wondering how they were going to justify a movie about the hospital in the story when its role had just ended.  Then, of course, the shooting of JFK's assassin occurs, and he was brought to the same hospital.  The duality of having to treat the assassinated and the assassin in the same hospital was offered such cinematic duality and intrigue.  The man who took the video of the shooting, the doctor who tried to save JFK, the secret service supervisor who lost him, and the knowing brother of the assassin are all people who are a part of this nation's history in one way or another, and this film brought them to life.  I wish they had focused a bit more on Jackie, but I understand why they didn't since there is only so much time in the film and since the goal seemed to be to focus on the lesser know people who were involved or affected by it.

5929384,5,B00EO10OF2,"""Parkland"" was intense and moving.

Produced by Tom Hanks, the movie covers a part of the JFK assassination that few know much if anything, about. The events at Parkland Hospital in the minutes immediately following the attack. The efforts by the trauma team to save the president, the struggle between the president's and vice president's Secret Service details, the FBI trying to find forensic evidence and locating Mr. Zapruder and his infamous film of the assassination, all against a backdrop of uncertainty as to how big an attack against the US is going down. One of the saddest untold parts of the story is touched on...The First Lady was all but forgotten in those chaotic minutes. Like so many relatives when a loved one is rushed into emergency--worse then than now--she was just left...alone. In many ways, too, it is the story of ordinary people being thrust by history into extraordinary situations.

The intensity matches any well-made Hollywood thriller. In that sense, it is riveting (even though we know the eventual outcome.) It's that production value--while still trying to stay reasonably historically-accurate--that got me to give it Five Stars.

The movie is based on Vincent Bugliosi's book ""Four Days in November."" Bugliosi was the guy who prosecuted the Manson Family and wrote ""Helter Skelter"" about that event. He knows his stuff; though it could be argued he went off the rails a few years ago when he starting advocating war trials for the president, etc.;-0)

Zac Efron (who I was/am ambivalent about in general) does a very solid job as the young Dr. Jim Carrico who first treats the president. Lots of stars in support of the film: Paul Giamatti, Billy Bob Thornton, Jacki Weaver, Ron Livingston, and (is he a rising or falling star?) Smallville's Tom Welling as Roy Kellerman, the president's Secret Service protector (questions about him for another day!)

I consider myself pretty well versed on the JFK assassination and ""Parkland"" is a thriller drama that will also give you a pretty historically-correct understanding of the events covered.",1480118400,5,2080,5.087976539589443
5929385,4,B00EO10OF2,"This is a very good film. Because I am so saturated with this event (having been 15 when it happened), there was a lot of material I've seen countless times before. That is going to be true for anyone in my age group. I could understand it if someone said they couldn't sit through it one more time. I was close to saying that myself. There are a couple of reasons why this film has enough new and fresh material to make it worth one's while to watch it.

First, I did not know that Oswald had a brother who lived in Dallas. This brother believed in his guilt but did all of the family things one does when caught in this kind of situation. He sees him in jail and is in seclusion with the law when his brother is killed. Then he has to take over the funeral as his mother is so bats that she can't be counted on for anything.  Seeing the entire scenario from his viewpoint was very interesting. LHO had been a massive screw up his whole life so that he had done this was believable to the brother. The actor playing the brother does a great job.

Second, this is the first time we see the scenario from the medical people's perspective. They have to have a different mindset from everyone else. It is absolutely essential. They see each case coming into the trauma surgery department as an emergency to be solved, if possible. (Back then they weren't able to save many whereas today more are saved.) There is not one left over second for them to be wondering who ""should"" be saved and who shouldn't. Every second of action on their parts counts. So they pour it all into saving the person, whomever it is, in front of them. And they can't listen to anyone else trying to interfere, no matter who it is. So by the time we see Oswald wheeled into Trauma, we are not surprised to see them spring into action, as usual. One can also see why there has to be some very dominant personalities in those ORs who tell everyone else what to do. This would be the surgeons and the head nurse.

Two other roles stand out. Paul Giametti as Zapruder, who takes the movie, is letter perfect as usual. He could be the real Zapruder. He has each nuance of the character in perfect harmony. Likewise, Billy Bob Thornton as the head of the Secret Service goes through a lot of complex feelings and actions in the time following the assassination. This is a major failure for his department and he's been with the SS for 47 years.

It was also interesting to see the SS and Air Force One crew get the President's body out of Dallas. First, they have to fight local officials who want to handle everything themselves, including the autopsy. The federal agents storm out of the hospital, coffin in tow, and just go through anyone in their way. When they arrive at the airport, they work with the crew to rip out seats and sections of the plane in order to get the coffin onboard. The plane wasn't built to carry coffins. I had just assumed they stowed the coffin in the belly of the plane and that was that.

I did remember how vital it was to get everyone back on Air Force One and fly back to Washington. This was because these agents had no idea what was afoot. A much larger attack could have been going on. LBJ was also in their care that day and it was imperative to get him sworn in on the plane so the country had a leader (especially if we were at war). Communication was very slow back then and it wasn't until much later in the day that the country as a whole was satisfied the attack had been confined to Kennedy and his car in Dallas and that it had not been done by a foreign power as an opening to a major war.

World War I was opened by a similar event, the assassination of Arch-Duke Ferdinand in Europe. So it was a valid concern.",1479340800,,3726,4.261669024045261

5929388,3,B00EO10OF2,"This movie is well-cast, well-acted and visually pleasing -- very watchable.  However, it ends ups feeling like a recap of a synopsis of CliffsNotes regarding the JFK assassination.  If you've read any of the reputable books or seen previous documentaries or movies on the subject, you will learn nothing new whatsoever.  I would actually only give it 2-1/2 stars simply because of its total failure to add anything new.",1477180800,,420,5.057971014492754

5929390,5,B00EO10OF2,"I especially enjoyed the part about Oswalds Family and his funeral.  In all my experience with the events of November 1963 in Dallas, I never, ever, even once, considered Lee Harvey Oswalds funeral.  I never even considered that Oswalds funeral was occurring during the same time that they were conducting the ceremonies for the President.  I knew Oswald had a brother, but it never once occurred to me to consider what Robert Oswald went through during those days.  The film did a respectable job of excluding the details of the actual assassination and Oswalds arrest, with those events omitted; the audience was free to draw their own conclusions thereby avoiding any claims to the many conspiracy theories.  Its interesting to consider that with Oswalds murder denying any real legal proceedings to be conducted and considering the instability and unreliability of Oswalds character, I truly believe that the truth as to Oswalds guilt or innocence has been lost to history.  Ironically, with Oswalds guilt left unanswered, the Presidency of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, as well as the man himself, may find immortality.",1475798400,,1119,5.188888888888889

I (& mom and dad, when home from work) watched the black and white TV nonstop that weekend. Last memory: Seeing Oswald murdered on live TV. This movie powerfully catches the gut-wrenching events in Dallas that sent us careening deep into Vietnam and Nixon and Watergate and the rest. Ironically, a month before, I saw JFK give a speech. The only president I have ever seen in person. I like to think if he had lived, JFK would have been smarter than LBJ.",1474156800,,596,4.427272727272728

8607206,5,B00EO10OF2,"On the day JFK was assassinated I was sitting in my third grade classroom. It was about 2:30PM (EST) when a school janitor knocked on our classroom door to get the attention of our teacher. When she opened the door, I could not help but to notice the fear I saw in the janitor's face, and with that, my teacher turned to us and said ""President Kennedy had just been killed."" The horror and pain of that moment, that day, and the ensuing three days that followed was well captured by 'Parkland.'  Bravo to all those involved in the production of this  American tragedy, the death of the 35th President of the United States.",1530662400,,622,4.447368421052632
8607207,2,B00EO10OF2,"Parkland is just a Hollywood dramatization of Olive Stones  JFK masterpiece. I watched JFK for the first time yesterday and was very impressed. So impressed, that I watched it three more times. Zach Efron? Like I said, Hollywood dramatization. After seeing JFK, I tried to start watching Parkland, but it just didn't have the appeal or magnetism of JFK. The choice of actors for Parkland makes absolutely no sense to me. I turned off Parkland and instead went searching for documentaries only to discover that Oliver Stone's JFK was well aligned to several  of those docs, and the addition of actual footage into the movie just made JFK so much more realistic. I guess what I should be saying is that, in spite of the raving reviews on Parkland, take a look at JFK and you be the judge.",1530230400,,786,4.64748201438849

8607209,5,B00EO10OF2,"I had my reservations about this movie, fearing it'd be another one pushing some kind of alternate theory.  Fortunately, it was not.  It's a great film instead, with fast-paced direction and care for the details (both of the story and the time).  In fact, it has to do with the moments immediately before JFK's assassination, and the days after the murder.  The cast is formidable, and together they make this movie an ensemble piece in which nobody tries to steal anyone's place or upstage anybody. In fact, it brings to life people who usually are left behind, like the ER crew at Parkland Hospital, which took care of the US president right after he was shot, and Mr. Zapruder, who became an unwilling history maker thanks to his super 8mm tape.  It's a great movie worth watching more than once!",1527033600,,799,4.678571428571429
8607210,1,B00EO10OF2,"The most famous actual film of JFK's assassination was accidentally captured by Zapruder.  The director of Parkland must have told his camera crew to make his movie look worse than Zapruder's.  When will movie directors ever learn that moving their camera randomly, zooming in and out like a child, and shaking the frame as if standing on a pogo stick while filming, is neither engrossing nor artistic?",1526860800,,402,4.985074626865671
