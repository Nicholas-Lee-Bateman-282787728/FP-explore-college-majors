8733126,3,B015BMHWY8,"Great Series....I'm a big fan. Although, this particular dvd production from somewhere out of Malaysia (I was so excited to get the package that I really wasn't paying that much attention) is sketchy at best. If you're semi-familiar with the Japanese language as I am...then some of the missing English subtitles won't matter too much, but there are gaps. Also missing are some of the inserted text explanations of some common phrases or parllence used in Japan that are common in something from a Sentai America Filmworks dvd production.

The animation itself isn't bad, just that it has a noticeable drop in quality even from the Sentai dvd production of the first season.

It's great to finally own the continuation of this series and see Hikigia, Yukino, and Yuigahama's continuing struggle to figure out their miss guided romantic youth adventure, but my advice to anyone who wants to own this series on dvd and not just watch it on crunchy roll, please wait for the American dvd production to hit the market. When that one arrives on the ""shelves,"" I will definitely be picking that one up.",1446508800,,1096,4.855614973262032
