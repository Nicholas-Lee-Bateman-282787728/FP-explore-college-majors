8559463,5,B00AZ6H9F8,"When I first saw this on Netflix I didn't think much about it, the animation was weird and the plot more of a ""girls"" thing. But I watched it. And got hooked. The way the characters are drawn still bothers me, the moe look of Yuki is so much so that she looks like those awful big eyed kid crap art that was popular back in the day. Other than that though, the plot kept me watching to the point I binge watched. The story line is very good (I'm not giving anything away like other reviewers other that to say you will get very interested)  and I prefer the Japanese version of vampire genre (more intense),  they go by ancient traditional Japanese lineage with aristocrats who are the ultimate ruling class (only they can make other vampires)followed by upper class followed by lower caste,  more than the American lame versions which tends to go for gore and lame romances. I first put my toe in the Japanese vampire genre with Dance in the Vampire Bund series (slight fan service in that one). No fan service (that stuff airs on national tv in Japan?) in Vampire Knight but a juicier plot. One thing that annoys me, is the mispronunciation of Japanese names Koname is mispronounced the whole way through and mistranslation of words. The whole spiel of Yuki meaning princess when the word means snow (do they even pay attention to what they are translating?)",1430006400,,1360,4.542857142857143
