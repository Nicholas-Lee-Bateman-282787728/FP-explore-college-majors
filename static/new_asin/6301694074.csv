346380,4,6301694074,"This is a very nice copy of the magic flute.  The voices were very good. Sound quality was sort of patchy, particularly at the beginning.  My favorite character is Papageno, whom I instantly admired as a robust model of epicureanism.  The costumes were pretty good.  The serpent at the beginning is pathetic- a middle school drama department could have done one better.  The ending could have been staged much better.  Overall pretty good.",1144108800,3,439,4.945205479452055
346381,5,6301694074,"I bought this video recording in VHS format of Mozart's famous singspiel, ""Die Zauberflote"" (The Magic Flute) in 1990, and it's the best all around production of Mozart's great opera I've seen.  I believe this is superior to the Levine/Met production from 1991, also on DG DVD.  This is a September 1983 live performance from the Bavarian State Opera, and features Francisco Araiza as Tamino;  Lucia Popp as Pamina;  Wolfgang Brendel as Papageno; Kurt Moll as Sarastro, among others.  I would call this a traditional production, rather like Ancient Egypt seen through the eyes of German intellectuals, unlike the Levine/Met production, which had more contemporary sets and yet had a more ""Ancient"" look to it than this Munich production.

Conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch (b. 1923) sets sensible tempos in the style of Karl Bohm, although many of Sawallisch's tempos are faster than Bohm's studio recording from 1964 (DG CD).  He is more moderate and middle of the road than Levine, and appeals more to my way of thinking Mozart's great opera should sound. While there are a few imperfections in singing and ensemble, the overall musical thrust is so good, these are quickly cast aside.

For more details, see my remarks about the VHS release of this title. I am glad and thankful DG is releasing this on DVD.",1131494400,94,1306,4.958715596330276
346382,5,6301694074,"This is a live performance from the Bavarian State Opera of Mozart's last great singspiel, DIE ZAUBERFLOTE (THE MAGIC FLUTE) conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch.  It is my first video of this opera, dating from 1990, and after 15 years of off/on viewing/listening, I am still most impressed with Sawallisch, the Bavarian State Opera Orchestra, singers Araiza, Popp, Brendel, Gruberova, Moll, etc.  The sound, even for VHS, is very good, and I've had much pleasure from this video.

The good news is: according to Deutsche Grammophon's website, Universal will be releasing this video on DVD in October, 2005.  I highly recommend this for the following reasons: great singing by the solo singers and chorus, sensible tempos set by conductor Sawallisch, acting which is appropriate but not ""over the top"", beautiful props and scenery, all combine together to make this a feast for the eyes AND the ears.  Sawallisch (born 1923) and forces serve Mozart well, and the message of ZAUBERFLOTE with great dignity and class.  Tempos are never too fast, and if there are a few minor precision problems between singers and orchestra (they are VERY FEW) they are rare.

I recently acquired James Levine/Metropolitan Opera (1991, the bicentenniel of Mozart's death - available on DG DVD) with singers Araiza and Moll from this cast in their respective roles.  I also like Levine, but think his overture is too fast and reckless; his chorus is too recessed in ""O Isis und Osiris"", and Kurt Moll (Sarastro) sounds fresher for Sawallisch.  Araiza sounds better for Sawallisch, too, and I like Tamino's clothing better in Munich than New York.  I also like the 3 Ladies better in the opening number, their costumes, method of shooting the monster with pistols chasing Tamino than the MET staging of this scene.

I recommend getting the Sawallisch MAGIC FLUTE DVD when it is released in October.  US release may be later this year; check Deutsche Grammophon/Universal's web site.",1124409600,27,1958,5.065420560747664

This is a performance at Bavaria State Opera in Munich, Germany, conducted by then the Music Director Wolfgang Sawallisch who now is the Music Director of Philadelphia Orchestra. This is not Met's performance led by Levine.

346387,5,6301694074,"I cannot count the number of Die Zauberlfote recordings that I own.  Almost every time a new production comes out, I grabbed it.
The earliest version that I have listened to is Ferenc Fricsay's. Great names abound there - Streich, Stader, Haelfiger, Fischer-Dieskau (as Papageno!)...Streich's Queen of Night is particularly memorable, in mono sound.  I also love the Boehm version's Tamino greatly - Fritz Wunderlich, though not equally matched by the rest of the cast, still ranks as the unsurpassed Tamino. Modern Zauberflote on CD includes Abbado's Roeschmann/Strehl/Miklosa.
On DVD, the Gedda/Mathis/Fishcer-Dieskau (as Speaker) version has another awesome Queen in Cristina Deutekom.
Then we have the Queen of Night in the ROH and Salzburg productions sung by the immaculate Diana Damrau, who tends to make us all forget about Cristina Deutekom, Lucia Popp and Rita Streich. She is not matched by subsequent Queens, including Erika Miklosa (Abbado CD), Elena Mosuc (DVD with Harnoncourt), or Rancatore (DVD with Roschmann and Beczala).
Well, this Munich live DVD of 1983 is in essence a reprisal of Bernard Haitink's CD version of 1981 - also with Lucia Popp as Pamina, Edita Gruberova as the Queen, Siegfried Jerusalem as a heldentenor Tamino, and another heldentenor Peter Hofmann as one of the two Armoured Men.
This Sawallisch live performance of the same production (check out the similar CD cover) does not boost of such a stellar cast as the Haitink recording. The minor roles are less well known here on DVD than the Haitink CD version, but they are nonetheless well performed.  Norbet Orth is a particularly outstanding Monostatos.
The only personage who boosts of an `increase' of casting in this Sawallisch recording is Kurt Moll's Sarastros against Bracht in Haitink.
Even so, this Munich live recording is memorable for quite a number of reasons.  The first is Popp's Pamina, not so often recorded, and certainly not so in other video recordings.  She is middle-aged by the time of this 1983 performance, but she actually looked younger than in Kleiber's Der Rosenkavalier in 1979. Both her singing and looks convince the viewer of the youthful charm and innocence of Pamina.  As her `mother', Edita Gruberova is not in her best voice in this performance, and modern viewers would certainly mercilessly compare her performance here with Diana Damrau's ROH and Salzburg performances, both on DVD. Nonetheless, Gruberova's Queen of Night is still a force of nature with her striking stage presence and wonderful voice.
Wolfgang Brendel's Papageno is big and burly, certainly doesn't look like a big catcher, and he sings in a strong voice. Luckily, he is a very fine actor, and throughout his performance, he is dramatically fully alert.  He is certainly a more joyous bird catcher than Simon Keenlyside! As far as performance goes, the most convincing figure in this production is Kurt Moll's Sarastro.  I seldom see him in his prime, and lo and behold, what an imposing figure! Even more so than Rene Pape in this role, who doesn't own Moll's regal demeanour.
We do not have any Prince Tamino in the 21st century anymore, and in this 1983 production when Taminos are still in good supply, Francisco Araiza's performance could be termed as vocally outstanding but visually imperfect. His Tamino is certainly unsurpassed - not a Christian Strehl (Abbado), or a Michael Schade or Piotr Beczala could surpass Araiza's lyrical-cum-heroic portrayal of this quasi-heldentenor role.  Araiza's rendition of Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd schn is meltingly beautiful with superb breath and dynamics control and ardent lyricism, while in the Temple Scene he sings in an abandoning and heroic manner.  The only quibble of his wonderful performance is his stage presence: the not too long ago Prince Charming in Le Cenerentola (1980) has turned into a plumb middle-aged in less than 3 years' time, alas.
So, even if you have a better Queen of the Night in Damrau, and you have an equally good Pamina in Rschmann, you would not have as good a Sarastro as Kurt Moll, or a similarly capable Tamino as Araiza.",1350864000,5,4107,5.098214285714286
346388,5,6301694074,"I sometimes think ""The Magic Flute"" is my favorite Mozart opera. But it is made up of such disparate elements that it's hard for any production to get everything right. Which is perhaps why I own seven recordings of the opera, three audio and four video.
This film from a 1983 Munich production would be my second choice for a video of the opera. The production is really quite lovely. The designs are beautiful, as are the eighteenth-century costumes. The old-fashioned stage elements like painted backdrops, moving set pieces, and trapdoors are used with charm and imagination. The cast is wonderful. Lucia Popp is pretty much a definitive Pamina, with her vocal and physical beauty and her wonderfully expressive singing. Edita Gruberova is a brilliant Queen of the Night, even if the top Fs aren't quite there on this particular evening (live performance, remember). Francisco Araiza is a lyrical and convincing Tamino. Wolfgang Brendel is a strong-voiced, genial Papageno, who keeps the comic shtick within bounds. Kurt Moll is a warm, imposing Sarastro, singing with a flawless legato line. The small parts are also well taken. Gudrun Sieber is a charming Papagena, Jan-Hendrik Rootering is an unusually powerful Speaker, the three ladies are a delight, and the three boys are wonderful. It's a bit surprising to see Monastatos and his henchmen in blackface, but this was before political correctness became universal; in any case, Norbert Orth provides a vivid character. The musical direction is in the capable hands of Wolfgang Sawallisch. I wish he'd taken more time with the slow numbers, but otherwise he turns in a well-paced, stylish performance. There is some messing-about with Act II. I can accept the logic of moving the farewell trio to the beginning of the act, but it seems strange musically to hear it there. I don't really miss the misogynistic duet for the two priests.
My favorite visual representation of the opera is Bergman's television film. No other director so fully realizes both the serious and fanciful sides of the work, and Bergman's visual images are unfailingly wonderful. Things are in good shape musically, though most of the singing is in the good-not-great class. I can live with Bergman's second act adjustments (omitting two numbers and reordering the finale), and I don't mind hearing the work in Swedish.
I have also watched the recently issued DVD of a 2005 Covent Garden production, which I find disappointing. Check out my review.",1277510400,16,2479,5.078431372549019
346389,5,6301694074,"This video ZAUBERFLOTE is very much better than Levine's for many reasons.  Starting with the glorious absence of Kathleen Battle who should be recording music for dentists' offices and nursing homes.  Instead we have beautiful authentic Lucia Popp who never forgot how it feels to be a little girl.  She wasn't German but she sure can SING German.  Kurt Moll in his relative youth is more virile and imposing as Sarastro than under Levine, frightening like Aslan in the NARNIA books, so good he makes you wonder how good YOU are.  Francisco Araiza also seems to have more at stake here than under Levine.  All this may be because of conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch who is much more brisk and youthful sounding than Levine.  (I don't think I've ever seen Mozart at the Met without thinking, too slow, too heavy, not true to Mozart's small-theater-oriented lightness of touch.  If there were an exception ZAUBERFLOTE would be it, it's the heaviest on ""awesome"" mode of Mozart's Big Five, but Levine overdoes even this.  It's like a museum, not a drama.)

As a special treat, the Sawallisch video includes an appearance in a speaking role by veteran heavyweight superstar Kurt Boehme, who in his time was a renowned Sarastro.  This almost makes up for the omission of the short duet warning of women's wiles, which is usually sung by two priests in Act II just before the Three Ladies tempt Tamino and Papageno to speak.  The only thing I don't like about this video is Wolfgang Brendel who seems brutish and unchildlike as Papageno.  Conversely, under Levine, Manfred Hemm does a great job in that role.

This performance is also better than others I've seen on video.  There's the one with Lazlo Polgar as Sarastro--he's a glorified baritone, not a true bass.  There are several with Matti Salminen, who has the biggest top in the bass world but no real bottom.  (He's like a TRex, the biggest and most dangerous dinosaur but with those little front limbs, at best useful only for picking meat out of carcasses.)  Kurt Moll is the only real infra-bass I've seen as Sarastro on video.  By ""infra-bass"" I mean someone who sings the bottom notes with no loss of relaxation or vibrato or richness of tone and gives the impression he could easily go further down.

The sets and costumes are designed by the very famous August Everding, and they are a pleasure.",1228953600,5,2353,4.762962962962963
346390,3,6301694074,"This is a very good performance of The Magic Flute. I must admit, the black-face Monostatos is a little off-putting (what? you can't find a good black tenor for the part?), but the singing is good, and in German (important to me). My favorite version of The Magic Flute is still that of the Dsseldorf Marionettentheater, but since that is not available on DVD, this will have to do.",1220918400,5,382,4.550724637681159

346392,4,6301694074,"The production style is traditional and the tempos are moderate - not too fast and not too slow.  The Queen is disappointing only in that her voice is not imposing enough and she does not look scary and evil enough, especially not with that large gaudy shiny diamond-studded crown she wears.  The most entertaining character, as expected, is Papageno who is dressed like an urban labourer with his blue-collar shirt (which is unbottoned near the top) with suspenders.  The only thing that tells you he is a bird-catcher are his feather-covered pants.  This Papageno is robust and jolly but lacks any avian eccentricities.  Rather than a bird fanatic, he looks like a simple-minded averge joe who is just trying to make ends meet and he fails the ritualitic tests miserably because he is too average, too ordinary and too proletarian compared to the noble, idealistic and well-bred Tamino, who, dressed in white, is played with passion and integrity in this production.  Pamina plays her part well but she looks a bit too old.  The Three Boys do not wear angel wings, but alternate between Roccoco formal dress and childish sailor suits.  Sarastro and his priests are grim and serious men dressed in long black coats, but Sarastro's voice is nonetheless deep and warm in a paternalistic way.  Monostatos is lustful, cruel and a caricature so (wonderfully) politically incorrect that it shows how old this Munich production really is.  Despite the age of this production by Sawallisch, it is still superior to many of the newer ones and probably even better than Levine's famous Met version.  Sawallisch's approach to this beloved Mozart opera is traditional and conventional but also solid and enduring.",1158105600,7,1702,5.0213523131672595
346393,5,6301694074,"While many traditional productions of opera these days look sleepy, either on a stage loaded with so much trappings and clutter, and/or looking as though a group of singers got dropped onto stage and left to their own devices, this is truly a most traditional production, in both all its consummate detail and inspired individual touches.

A certain degree of realism and social commentary inform the August Everding production here. Sarastro's temple is set in solemnly austere design of dark brick and wood, which opens out into a silhouetted relief of what could pass for a Greek temple and also imaginatively to a decrepit looking courtyard, where Tamino faces his trial of silence, which gives us a hint that Sarastro's temple may have seen better days. A certain rigid manner about two of Sarastro's priests also tell us as much (and who are denied their brief Act Two duet).

For the incidents of extra magic that occurs in this production, and that Mozart would have been happy with, in contradicting the cold reason of the Enlightenment, the scenes that take place with the courtyard set just mentioned practically dare you to blink, not to miss anything.  I do not want to give away any secrets here, except that Wolfgang Brendel, as Papageno, in some of the action here, and everywhere, makes up for a few dry spots vocally, by perfectly natural acting of his part. Costumed as a simple warning man or peasant, he works very well, in interaction with everyone else, in capturing the full humor of his part.

Brighter evocations of nature make up very pleasant backdrop for a couple of scenes during the finale to Act Two, for Pamina and the 3 Boys and for Papageno alone, right before meeting up with Papagena in front of a curtain backdrop of a giant oak. The temple, silhouetted before, opens out, suffused with cool light, as Kurt Moll as Sarastro blesses his two new initiates, Pamina and Tamino.

Lucia Popp, as Pamina, is practically enough reason for giving this Zauberflote the highest possible acclaim and for why this belongs in every serious opera dvd collection.  Take for instance her opening of ""Ach ich fuhls"" in Act Two, which immediately touches the chord or setting for what the entire rest of the aria will be like, which she continues to sing most expressively.  Her scene, with the three boys is at least equally sublime in making her way from total despondency, despair to joyful anticipation of meeting Tamino again, consummated by her utterly exquisite ""Tamino mein"", upon finally greeting him, and radiant demeanor in helping the Tamino of Francisco Ariaza bring the trials of fire and water and their vocal parts to a close.

Her acting matches that of Wolfgang Brendel in their Act One scenes together, in complete believability. Lucia Popp, as many fans already know, was some sixteen years before, a Queen of the Night of classic status on the Otto Klemperer Zauberflote (with all spoken dialogue taken out) for EMI.

Eschewing the least bit of any exaggeration or hindrance to full expressivity of her lines, Edita Gruberova ideally, coolly yet imperiously picks up the mantle Popp had held for the part of the Queen of the Night before, in her musical and dramatic authority in it.  Her sidekick trio of three ladies (Pamela Coburn, Cornelia Wulkopf, Daphne Evangelatos) are as fine vocally and musically, among video choices, as you will find.  While perfectly seductive enough and costumed to be very attractive to the eye, this trio is perhaps a little less menacing than one other out there.

Francisco Araiza, hardly more than a dutiful presence on stage dramatically, and with slight tendency to pout a few more dramatic lines in his part, warmly and elegantly spins out so many lyric lines here, with so much more colorful command of nuance here than found with Peter Schreier on Sawallisch's cd set or his own much drier, less interesting contribution for James Levine on the Met dvd.

Kurt Moll is the warm voiced Sarastro, his voice rolling effortlessly through ""In diesen heil'gen Hallen"" and with expressive point both here and the other passages for him. A certain fire about his look or gaze informs even those moments of warmth to convey to Pamina his genuine forbearance in looking out after her. He reappears in the Met Zauberflote dvd eight or nine years later, with undiminished feeling of authority in the part, except for some obvious graying of his vocal prowess and a certain detached manner about him, that had me thinking that all this business with initiates and trials must be incredibly passe or perhaps long by now routinely and terribly de riguer for Sarastro.

Jan-Hendrik Rootering is the ample voiced and authorative Speaker of the Temple, Norbert Orth the entirely black faced and mostly sweet voiced Monostatos, if a little less menacing than one or two others on video by now. Choral forces, including for a properly majestic rendition of and processional up high and stage rear for ""O Isis und Osiris"", and supporting cast are all in top form.

I am not quite entirely sure, even after reading the annotation in the well informative liner notes (in nice booklet form) of the changing places between Sarastro's aria ""O Isis und Osiris"" and the brief trio with Pamina, and Tamino joining him,that doing this is right, but at least it is well accounted for in the liner notes and may persuade some viewers.

Wolfgang Sawallisch leads a pleasing middle-of-the-road interpreation of this score, levelheaded in almost all choices of tempo and modern, yet supple enough in its simple pacing of so much, yet plush in orchestral sonorities, even with incidences of doubtful intonation from woodwinds.  He is always very supportive of his singers, if not the last word in being imaginative with so much that this score has to offer.

He improves on his earlier analogue set (that has been reissued on cd) in having a more varied cast here, in terms of vocal color, without losing out on issues of diction and meaningful interaction between cast members.  An overriding blandness, sterility both scenically and musically to the Levine/Met Zauberflote on dvd, also on DGG, helps to make the Sawallisch here a clearly preferable choice.

Ultimately, as well supported by Sawallisch, the expert staging here, and the contributions of just about every cast member, humanity emerges as the highest and most prevailing order in society, in place of a clerical, monastic, or even a Masonic one. The complexity of Mozart's vision is as well encapsulated here as may also be the case in one or two auteur productions of this great work.  Here the charm of Mozart's inspiration endures from start - traffic signals both to left and right from a moon-silhouetted Queen of the Night in alt - to finish.",1149379200,59,6758,4.89501312335958

Wolfgang Swallish does a wonderful job conducting and the orchestra is amazing. The cast is pretty good. After the first few main characters the list flops into a list of nobody's.  Francisco Arazia as Tamino is (as always) wonderful. Edita Gruberova is one of the greatest queen's ever. Kurt Moll is a very solemn singer and takes his tempos very slow but forms them into a work of art. Lucia Popp is a good Pamina but didn't quite spark my interest (she looked a little to old to play Pamina). All the secondary characters were good and fit there parts well. A big peeve of mine was that they cut out the 2 priests 2nd act duet, but I can live without it. A good idea was the sequencing of the 2nd acts 1st few scenes. I thought it was a really good idea.

7814026,4,6301694074,"You can't really argue with Simon McBurney's approach to Die Zauberflte in this production at the Dutch National Opera. The director recognises that a child-like simplicity is needed to present the fresh look on the enlightened world that Mozart and Schikaneder's work looks towards, but at the same time there's a need to avoid the danger of the message getting lost or seen as utopian if the production is played too much like a fairytale or a pantomime. The difficulty is in how to achieve this simplicity without losing the magic that is also a necessary part of the work.

The production seems to be aiming for a freer 'live' or improvisational feel, but it feels a little bit over-worked to really achieve that aim. The birds that Papageno hunts, for example, are represented by a dozen extras running around the stage flickering pages from the score. It's a nice idea, but it feels like a lot of work for little benefit or impact. The same can be said of the use of a visible foley artist in a box at the side of the stage to create live sound effects. Other aspects of Michael Levine's stage designs are similarly low-fi in technology terms, the main stage device being a platform that is raised and lowered as required. Costumes too have a grungy feel and seem to have little consistency. What does work well however are the projections, the hand-drawn chalk titles and the magnified sets that use a bookcase for the temple of wisdom.

The real magic of The Magic Flute is, as its title suggests, in the music itself. More than anything else, Mozart's score convincingly makes the case that art and music can lead to the betterment of man and perhaps even change the world, and Albrecht's conducting of the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra is just gorgeous. There's a wonderful lightness of touch that works perfectly with the singers and supports the spontaneity of the production, with vividness, energy and delicacy according to the mood of the scene. McBurney meaningfully exploits the interaction between the pit and the stage, having musicians from the orchestra step up to play the flute and the keyboard glockenspiel, as well as actors occasionally stepping down into the pit.

The singing is first-rate and perfect for the production. Maximilian Shmitt is outstanding as Tamino and perfectly matched with Christina Landshamer's Pamina, even if she doesn't quite sail through some of the more challenging parts of the opera. Both however have a lyrical sweetness, clarity of enunciation and good projection, giving lively performances. There's no high-powered singing here - with the exception possibly of Iride Martinez's strong Knigin der Nacht - but everyone fits in with the delicate tone of the musical performance. If all the magic isn't there in the production design, the musical and singing performances nonetheless make this wholly as great as only Die Zauberflte can be.

I would think this production would have been a difficult one to capture on video, and the HD transfer of the largely dark stage consequently isn't as impressive as you usually find. Technically however, there are no problems and all the detail is there. The audio tracks are marvellous, the singing clear, but the music in particular has a warmth and detail that reveals the beauty of individual playing. The usual DNO backstage feature on the production is entertaining and informative. The Blu-ray is region-free, subtitles are in English, French, German, Dutch, Japanese and Korean.",1423267200,3,3483,4.989672977624785

  Norbert Orth - Monostatos

If you love beautiful singing I can enthusiastically recommend this Bavarian State Opera 'Flute' recorded 19-20 September 1983, with the most famous of all Taminos, Francisco Araiza, and a Sarastro to die for, Kurt Moll.  The ladies ain't bad either.  Edita Gruberova sings the Queen of the Night and Lucia Popp is a charming, sweetly sung Pamina.

Wolfgang Sawallisch conducts the Bayerisches Staatsorchester in a majestically slow overture that dissolves into scampering strings, and the curtains open on Tamino being chased by a fire-snorting dragon (the Flute dragons tend to be silly rather than scary).  The Queen of the Night, silhouetted in a full moon directs her three ladies to kill the serpent, then they argue amiably over who should stay with the unconscious Tamino while the others go inform their ruler of the outcome of their battle.  The  three depart together, then enters star Munich baritone, Wolfgang Brendel singing Papageno's famous ""Der Vogelfnger bin ich ja.""  He is an obvious audience favorite:  big, sweet in a guy sort of way, and very athletic--he makes a later entrance by swinging down onto the stage from a rope,  la Tarzan.  He is a true ""Naturmensch"" just as the libretto describes him.

Slovak coloratura soprano, Edita Gruberov delivers her two arias with icy clarity in spite of a minor costume malfunction.  She is the true alien in the opera, not Papageno.

I don't think I have ever heard a more luminous Pamina than Lucia Popp.  Her voice is that of a young woman:  sweetly tender and innocent in the opening scenes with Papageno, then filled with a heart-piercing melancholy when she believes that Tamino no longer loves her.

Kurt Moll is 'the' perfect Sarastro, and I say this in spite of a 'Flute' recording with my favorite bass, Sam Ramey singing the role.  Wikipedia describes Kurt Moll's voice as ""notable for its range, a true infra-bass (lower than basso profondo), including full, resonant low and very-low notes with relaxed vibrato; also for its unusual combination of extreme size and a purring, contrabassoon-like timbre.""  Perfect.  I wish I were Pamina while Sarastro is singing ""In diesen heil'gen Hallen,"" so I could put my ear against his chest and listen to those incredible vibrations from the lowest depths of the human voice.

There are a couple of theatrical embarrassments in this production:  just a few moth-eaten bears and monkeys show up when Tamino toots on his flute,  and Monostatos is rigged up to look like Al Jolson in harem pants:  a truly mortifying make-up job.  However the sets are darkly splendid, the voices world-class, and the music is...Mozart.  What higher praise is there?",1410566400,,2877,5.010593220338983
