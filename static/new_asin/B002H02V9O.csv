3926088,5,B002H02V9O,"This video was great for our son! He was just turning three and although he understood the potty basics, he was not very motivated to use the potty. He wasn't ready for underwear yet and we were struggling with keeping him motivated and getting him to try without constantly telling him what to do. A friend lent us this video saying they had great success with their 4-year old girl.

This was the answer for my son. After the first viewing he asked to sit on the potty and went! He enjoyed the songs and seeing other kids, and asked to watch it every day. We watched on Friday and Saturday morning; Saturday he wore underwear all day with no accidents. We watched on Sunday and on Monday he wanted to go to preschool in his underwear and told Grandpa ""no more diapers for me!"" He did have some accidents on and off at school over the next few weeks but he stayed motivated and trying. We watch about every other day.

We returned the borrowed copy to our friend and I am buying this for continued viewing as needed for our 3-year old (who is now 100% potty trained) as well as for our 1-year old when he begins.",1262476800,9,1113,4.295238095238095
3926089,3,B002H02V9O,"I purchased this dvd for my 3 year old son who has been resistant to using the potty. He has been interested in watching the the dvd and has requested it a few times, but he hasn't voluntarily started using the potty without considerable prodding from me.",1260835200,,255,4.446808510638298
3926090,5,B002H02V9O,"I don't know whether it's the hypnotic stare of the show's host, the videos of real children on the potty, the insanely catch tunes, or the straightforward way the potty process is described... All I know is that it has worked magic for everyone I know who has used it for their 2-3 year-olds. One day they are reluctant to even sit on the potty, and within days they're wearing underwear! It's worth a try for the money.",1260316800,5,421,4.410256410256411
3926091,4,B002H02V9O,I love this video. My daughter is not quite ready for potty training but we watch it now and again to get her ready. The content keeps her occupied and she enjoys the video. The sound does tend to go soft then get loud but it's not that big of a deal. I think this will really help her when the time comes to start training! It is an excellent buy.,1258156800,,348,3.915492957746479
3926092,5,B002H02V9O,My 2 1/2 year old LOVES this DVD...he will watch it back to back to back.  This upbeat and positive program makes using the potty an exciting and fun experience for little ones-my son used the potty by himself for the first time yesterday and was so pleased with his accomplishment!  The songs are catchy and the pace is just perfect for a toddler.  I'll definitely be using this DVD with my younger child when the time is right.,1255392000,2,429,4.405063291139241
3926093,2,B002H02V9O,"Had high hopes for this one, but it did not hold any interest for my 18 month or 2-1/2 year old grand children.  They watched it once, and didn't seem to get into it at all; and it certainly didn't inspire them to use the potty.",1252886400,3,228,3.9565217391304346

3926095,5,B002H02V9O,"It is no wonder it is #1 in toilet training, the DVD works! It really helped our first son speed along the process. And his mother agrees too that its a winner! Thanks Potty Power!!!",1250726400,,182,4.228571428571429
3926096,5,B002H02V9O,"My boy Dylan was having trouble transitioning to the potty.  How many times did he go off into the corner and stand there?!!  When asked what he was doing, he would say, ""Nothing.""  When asked if he needed to use the potty, he would say, ""No.""  Of course, he did.  Well, if this sounds familiar, then ""Potty Power"" is the answer.  I bought this 2009 version (don't know the difference but went for the more current date). Dylan began watching it and within a week started getting to the potty instead of the corner.  Very impressive.  After trying the potty bear, books, and tons of reasoning and pleading (which all worked with my daughter way back when), I am just thankful and relieved that this DVD worked.  I wish I had gotten it sooner.",1248048000,48,742,4.477611940298507
3926097,5,B002H02V9O,"My little guy loves this DVD. Asks everyday to watch it over an over. He dances and sings along. Guaranteed by the end of the movie he's flinging his diaper to the ground and demanding underwear. He hasn't quite gotten to the point where I can trust him without a diaper, but it's a start! This DVD is a bit silly and annoying but it's getting the point across to my strong-willed 2 year old.",1471737600,,392,4.24
3926098,5,B002H02V9O,"I've been having issues with my daughter and potty training, due to a lot of emotional issues, and pain associated with constipation, so potty training has been a nightmare. Now it may not seem like a lot to most parents, but now I can successfully get my child on the potty 2-3 times a day and she's happy to do it. Before she would cry endlessly at the mere mention of the potty. I would recommend this video to anyone who needs help, and especially with those who have seemingly tried everything else.",1465776000,,504,4.43010752688172
3926099,5,B002H02V9O,"The songs are cheesy but my daughter  absolutely loves this and asks to watch it every day.

I would recommend this to anyone getting ready to potty train, to get kids interested!",1464307200,,342,4.683333333333334

3926102,5,B002H02V9O,"used it with both children, boy and girl, when they started showing signs of being interested in using the potty.  Then I used it to reiterate the idea that using the potty is SUPER COOL.  The songs are very catchy and the girl that narrates was able to connect with my kids.  There is an animated roll of toilet paper!  The little skit at the end was super funny to my kids at 2, 3 and 4 years old.  I was proud to wear my underwear after watching this.  And my kids still sing the wash your hand song while washing their hands.",1461024000,,529,4.087378640776699
3926103,5,B002H02V9O,"No doubt about it - a solid 5 stars.  Bought this for my three year old great grandson, and within a week, he was telling everyone when he needed to ""pee"" or ""poop.""  Afterward, he does the raised two armed salute and yells, ""Potty Power!""  I'm not sure how and why it makes such a memorable impression on toddlers,  but I do know it works.  Embarrassingly, I admit I love to watch it myself.  Cute and effective.",1437609600,,413,4.298701298701299
3926104,5,B002H02V9O,My kids loved this movie.  WARNING: songs are catchy and will get stuck in your head...,1436572800,,87,4.4375
3926105,5,B002H02V9O,"I have trained 2 boys so far, but my 3rd boy was a little hesitant. I popped this bad boy into the DVD played and immediately he was very excited about going on the potty. He watched it about 15+ times (no exaggeration) before he actually peed in the potty, but the movie still put him in the mindset that going pee/poop in the potty means you're a big kid. Now when he goes in the potty, he says ""potty power!"" and sings the songs. The movie is extremely corny, but if it gets my kid to use the potty, I really couldn't care less. I really believe this movie gave him the push that he needed to gain the confidence to go on the potty.",1435536000,,635,4.0476190476190474

3926108,5,B002H02V9O,"So cheesy for adults, but my little boy loved it at 3 - and still enjoys it at 5! He was not ""getting it"" with the training, but shortly after watching this we trained quickly. The DVD has also promoted his interest in doing other ""big kid"" things on his own; there's a great song about big kids at the beginning. Highly recommend!",1424649600,,331,4.26984126984127
3926109,5,B002H02V9O,"Potty Power is crazy addictive for little ones. My four year old used this when she potty trained, and I remember watching it over and over--and how she would remember and be motivated after seeing it. Today we figured we'd see if our 17 month old might be interested. We're not trying hard to potty train her...but are trying to introduce the concept. We're on our second viewing today. She's so focused and concentrated. I haven't seen her this focused any other time. So we'll see if it helps, but if our previous experience is an indicator (and I'm sure it is) this will be very helpful. I highly recommend it. Unless you don't like your kids watching the same thing over and over. In which case, you'll want to avoid this or expect to have an upset kid when they don't get to watch it 4 times in a row...",1424044800,,809,4.364238410596027

3926124,5,B002H02V9O,Beware that you will be marching around and singing the songs with your little one. . . which is actually a pretty good way of encouraging them to be excited about using the potty.,1391040000,,180,4.323529411764706
3926125,5,B002H02V9O,"My 2.5 year old daughter wanted nothing to do with it....then we denied her all her cartoons lol and this was the only thing she could watch...then all of a sudden once it was her only option she started to pay attention and ended up loving it.  She would want to watch it over and over.  She ended up preferring to go right for the toilet without using a potty chair or seat adapter.  It was a week of heck in the house as we had tried the whole pull-up business for months and failed, so this go around we said no pull-ups and went straight to panties.  Like in the DVD they get rid of the diapers, well pull-ups in my honest opinion now are nearly as absorbent as a diaper, so I just don't feel at least for us that our daughter could really tell when to go, and she doesn't pay attention to the design on the diaper changing if she pees.  After a few carpet accidents, she started having accidents closer and closer to the potty.  Finally it took about an entire week and she started making it in time for the potty.  But she had an 11 year old sister helping to potty train her, so seeing her go potty that way may have been an influence as well.  The DVD definitely helped my stubborn little girl and I am glad I purchased it.  Now she is 3 and almost completely potty trained, she does wear a cloth diaper to bed as she still has nighttime accidents, or if we go on a road trip she wears one as if she falls asleep she often will have an accident.  Now we need a DVD to teach her how to wake up before having an accident and go potty.",1390348800,2,1541,4.0561056105610565
3926126,5,B002H02V9O,"Our daughter watched this video a bizillion times.  One week she just decided she was going to start using the potty and that was it.  We didn't have to do any work to teach her to use the potty.  I hear this version of Potty Power is the best, thought I have no experience with the others.  I highly recommend buying this video.",1390176000,,329,4.174603174603175
3926127,5,B002H02V9O,"My autistic daughter is 4years old and I felt she was finally ready to potty train. This video really boosted her excitement and motivated her. Autistic children are very literal and it was helpful for her to see real kids going to potty not a cartoon or muppet.  My daughter was potty trained in 2 weeks but that was due to a boot camp style potty training. This video helped her understand the process, embrace the change to wear underwear and I was thrilled when she threw down the pull up, saying ""no diaper.""  I agree with the one reviewer, this is geared for older children. I'm so happy to see how good she feels about herself now that she's potty trained. It's been such a boost in her confidence.",1389657600,,705,4.415384615384616

My son loved it and all the songs!  The host is very peppy, animated and speaks clearly, which is great for holding little ones' attention.  We had tried unsuccessfully a few times in the last few months.  We watched this video, the Elmo one, and played a game with his dinosaurs where I made them go pee pee in the potty too.  Stickers did not work.  Candy did not work.  This video helped greatly, and we gave him a quarter to use in our gumball machine that dispensed skittles every time he pee peed or pooped.

3926154,4,B002H02V9O,"This worked great to motivate my two year old to potty train. Both of my young toddlers are fully potty trained. The girl in the video sings different songs about using the potty, how to wash hands, and how to wipe from front to back. Toddlers sing and sit on the potty to set an example. However, there is a part at the end of the video that I really can't stand. A goofy man is dressed as a king's jester. He sings an annoying song in a high pitched voice. I always skipped the end. Other than that, it's a good tool to assist with training.",1360540800,,543,4.08411214953271

Any attempt at getting to a menu gives me a blank gray screen. I then have to play the DVD from the beginning. Skipping chapters is also disabled. This wouldn't be so bad if there wasn't a really creepy commercial/trailer for some solar system video they made. At the end of the Potty Power video, it continues with a FAQ for Parents.

3926156,5,B002H02V9O,"First of all, wow. This movie is annoying beyond all belief. The production is cheesy, the songs stick in your head for DAYS, and it looks like it was made in the 80s. A denim shirt, really?

Okay, enough about that. We ordered this at the end of November when our son was about 28 months old. We were not in any hurry to potty train, and wanted to take things at his pace. However, I thought this would be a fun way to introduce some of the concepts to him and try to spark his interest. He watched it about 3 times a day, 4-5 days a week, for about 2-3 weeks. Then we went on vacation for the Christmas holiday and that was that. When we returned home at the beginning of January, my son insisted it was time to potty train. He started removing his own dirty diapers, leaving them on the floor, and putting his pants back on. After a couple days of this we decided to give it a shot. We've been potty training for almost a month now and he's done really well. He still has accidents and isn't yet wearing undies at nap time or overnight, but he went from defiantly protesting ""NO!"" when any talk of potty training came up, to suddenly VERY interested and ready to do it. Whether this movie made that happen or he just decided he was ready, I'm not sure. But he definitely enjoyed the movie and LOVES whenever I sing the songs to him while we're potty training. It has definitely instilled pride in himself, as he will randomly shout throughout the day ""Potty Tower!"" Ha! We tried to correct him, but to no avail. So, Potty Tower, it is. Either way, he enjoyed it and we suffered through it, with the end result being a confident and willing boy ready to tackle potty training.",1360108800,4,1678,4.260188087774295
3926157,5,B002H02V9O,"I gave this movie 5 stars because my son literally wants to watch it over and over. Is it annoying? Yes. Has it helped tremendously with the potty-training process? Not yet. Has it gotten my child engaged in the conversation about potty-training and made him more receptive to the idea of sitting on the potty? DEFINITELY.

The lady's singing voice is flat-out obnoxious, and the DVD has a somewhat ""amateur"" feel to it, but the content and the approach is absolutely fantastic in my opinion. They use real children in the 2-3-4 year old age group, and they use a teddy bear for the parts that explain the wiping process.

My son (who is 2.5 and was before quite annoyed with sitting on the potty) is now able to sit on the potty and watch the potty power movie without worrying about wanting to get up every 5 seconds.

As I mentioned, we have not made any MAJOR strides in the potty-training process as of yet, but anything that moves us in the right direction is a good product in my opinion!

I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has an old(er) potty-training child, or to anyone who is interested in introducing the subject in a fun, enjoyable way for your child.",1357776000,,1185,4.5233644859813085

The movie is short, effective, and engaging to its audience.  The songs are catchy too.  You will find yourself singing ""I'm proud to wear my underwear"" in your head.

Our first daughter loved this movie above all others for months.  She potty trained quickly at about 20 months, but continued to want to watch the movie even after she had it down.  Now we are starting it again, with her little sister at 18 months.

Our daughter's friends love it too...  we have had 4 or 5 little tikes running in circles, singing along.

3926162,3,B002H02V9O,"Just like Barney, this is annoying and cheesy and looks like it was made a couple decades ago.  Bought it over a year ago to get my son, then 2 1/2, more interested in using the potty more consistently.  He liked the movie okay but never sang along or seemed more motivated by watching it.  My daughter is now 23 months and LOVES potty power.  She decided to use the potty of her own accord at 18 months but we played this to reinforce.  She sings along, loves watching the kids.  Watching this show has not increased her motivation at all though.

The songs are cheesy but rather catchy.  I find myself singing them when I'm helping her on the potty.  The actors are lame and I wish I had a dollar for every time the main lady says ""all you have to do"" but it's a kid show and the kids like it.  I gave it three stars because I don't think it really helped MY kids learn much but I do think it would be  a great way to introduce the concept of potty to a kid who has never used it before or doesn't have older siblings (especially other toddlers) that they see use the potty.

They mostly show kids using a potty chair but some kids use the big potty.  They show kids ""wiping"" a Teddy bear and washing their own hands.  There's a silly little story about a princess who refused to use the potty then decides to use it to be a big girl.  The court jester in this sketch is silly and makes both my kids laugh.

Out of nowhere today, she came up to me and said ""pants, please,"" meaning that she wanted her pants off. I took her to the potty, sat her down with some of her books, and she peed. This is after only a week of seeing the DVD. She basically learned what to do from watching it and is training herself. I wish we would have just gotten this thing from the get-go.

3926166,1,B002H02V9O,"I was very excited to get this DVD to help my 3-year old son along with potty training, but it completely derailed his progress. I can't comment so much on the Potty Power portion itself, since we only watched it once, and never got past the second viewing of the age-inappropriate and scary space/rocket trailer they tacked on to the beginning of this DVD... It scared the daylights out of my little guy! I initially tried selecting the DVD Menu with my remote, but the DVD just locked up, and went back to where it left off; in this case, back to the scary space trailer. I then tried to fast-forward through it, but then it re-played it, so we had no option but to watch a 3-year old's version of a horror flick. It wasn't so bad the first time he watched it. He then went on to watch Potty Power, which he liked enough to ask for a second viewing. When the scary space trailer came back on, he freaked out and screamed that he didn't want to watch ""this one... It scares me!"" He was trembling and crying hysterically; I had to turn it off. It scared him so much (fast-forwarding through it was freaky, even to me) that he wanted the actual DVD case out of his sight... And he hasn't been willing to go on the potty all day (which he's been doing for a year; we're just struggling with #2), saying that the monsters in the dark are going to get him. I may be able to talk him down from his fear in a few days, but right now this kid is terrified. A promo trailer with images of dark sky (think ""black hole in the toilet"") and talking moons/planets with scary human faces superimposed on them (these struck me as the ultimate in ""boogy-men"" that supposedly live in the big black hole in the toilet; keep in mind this is for a 3-year old audience) is so far off the mark for a potty-training DVD it's not even funny. Besides, if we're struggling with potty training, we are certainly not going to be shopping for a planet-learning DVD next... An ABC trailer, or one with cute teddies or dogs would have been much more appropriate.

So, if you're looking to have a small child watch this; beware that it may not scare the cr*p out of them, but rather scare them back into their diapers.",1345420800,2,2186,4.292978208232445

I bought her big girl pants of every shape color and character. I tried bribes, bartering, toy rewards and nothing worked. Everything ended with, I am a baby! I want a diaper on!

Not only did she put her own underwear on day 2 and been wearing them ever since, but today she went in and pottied all by herself and didn't even ask for help on day 5. She pottied the first time alone. I have to say I am amazed. Truly amazed. I am still in shock. This video does have more references to girls, talking about a princess.

3926171,5,B002H02V9O,"I bought this DVD when my oldest was ready to potty train.  It did the trick in getting her motivated to try it.  She loved it, and even still asks to watch it sometimes, even though she's been accident free (even at night) for over a year!  I let her, because we're now trying to get her little brother (soon to be three) motivated to try the potty.  He loves it too, but we have yet to have any actual success with the potty.  Now, from an adult perspective, this DVD is a little creepy and annoying at times, actually.  The acting is cheesy and a little over-the-top, there's one actor with a voice that grates on my nerves (like listening to nails on a chalkboard), and the songs are almost a little too upbeat (a good thing from a child's perspective). You will find yourself singing or humming the catchy little Potty Power songs to yourself . . . at the very least, they'll be running through your head constantly until your child is finally bored of watching this DVD.  ""What do you like to do when you're sitting on the potty?""  Anyone?  Yeah . . . not proud of that one.  Fortunately, I was alone when I caught myself humming that song as I prepared dinner.  My husband actually hates it so much he forbid my daughter from watching it while he's home.  So, while my kids absolutely love this DVD, I have a love-hate relationship with it.  I gave it five stars because my opinion really doesn't count, since it is geared toward toddlers and preschoolers.  My kids love it, it got them motivated to try the potty, and that's all that counts, right?  My recommendation does come with a warning though . . . as a potty training parent, be prepared to sing catchy potty time tunes to yourself and brace yourself for cheesy potty training videos until you have passed this stage of parenting.  You will at times find yourself trying to restrain yourself from either hiding or destroying this DVD (or any other potty training DVD, for that matter).  All of this just comes with the territory, I'm afraid.  I have yet to find a better potty training DVD than Potty Power . . . all the potty training DVDs I have seen are equally cheesy/annoying.

Its great that it shows little kids sitting on the potty, wearing underwear, and wiping (demonstrated on a teddy bear, a great idea).  She is talking more about underwear and the potty since we have started watching this.  Watch it once a day or every other day.

She can't get enough, and loves to dance to all the songs. She also thinks that Jessica (the ""host"") is talking to her. :P

I think the video is geared more towards older kids, since most of the kids in the video can pull a wagon, tie their own shoes, pull their pants up, and other ""big kid"" behaviors. But it has already paid for itself in entertainment value alone. My girl often holds up her fist and shouts ""Power!"" after she's done a doody in her diaper, which shows that she kind of gets the point already.

Anyway, I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is considering purchasing it. It demystifies this whole ""potty"" business and even makes going to the potty look like fun.

Jessica is a very nice and friendly young woman. She starts by playing a game of asking things that differentiate babies and big kids. Then they sing catchy songs about saying bye-bye to diapers, what to do when you're sitting on the potty, and so on. This DVD covers everything from where the pee and poo comes from, why babies wear diapers, why big kids wear underwear, where is the potty and the toilet, that it's ok to take a long time to ""go"" sometimes, to remember to wipe your bottom (also shown how to do it on a giant teddy bear), throw the pee and poo away in the big toilet and flush (it also covers what is flushing), washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds (the time to sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star). It ends with a very silly princess movie with the same girl Jessica, and the story of Princess Jill who is learning how to use the potty. This last part is very silly and parents are going to go INSANE, but it's about kids, and kids love it.

We've only had this DVD for a week, but she loves to watch it every day and now walks around saying ""No more diapers for me!"".

I'm sure it does, if you can get your child to watch it.

My 2 1/2 year old daughter has a ""mouth issue"". For example she hates the funny face segment of Yo Gabba Gabba when the kids pull on the corners of their mouths. We hot her past it by explaining that it was just a few moments and she didn't have to look at the tv while that was on. Future crisis adverted.

In pops ""T.P."" Now I know that this isn't produced by Disney or anything but this CG was bad. So bad. The mouth was oversized and the sync was woefully off. Which set my child off. This little bugger pops in and out of the shot over and over again so there's no ""waiting it out"". Finally 10 minutes in we had to turn it off.

I'm sure if you can survive the awful acting, sad graphics and just plain cheesiness of the whole thing, your child may learn something.... but for my money i'd rather watch Barney... and that's saying a lot.",1313625600,,1075,4.153846153846154

We tried a few weeks than would wait a few weeks and try again.  We had no problem getting him to sit on the potty but he wouldn't do anything and would go as soon as he go off.  So I bought this video and played it the whole day thinking even if he wasn't watching it some of it would sink in.  Than the next day I put him in under wear and played the video again and gave some of the kids names to make it more personal to him.  He wet his clothes once and I changed him and told him he would have to change his wet clothes himself the next time.  In a few hours he again wet his clothes after sitting on the potty for 15 minutes.  So he took off his shorts and under wear and ran around with a bare butt.  I always said I would never train a child by letting him be naked as some books suggest but I was at the point of trying anything.  After a short time he came running to the potty chair sat down and with a huge smile on his face said ""I peed"".  And indeed he did.  So we made a big deal of It and called his daddy at work.  I  gave him a small prize.  The rest of the day he stayed dry and used the potty.  The next day he poohed in the potty and he has only had a few accidents since.  For about a week he would pooh in his pants but than decided to use the potty for that too.  It is now two weeks out and he is totally trained and I credit this video.  He still mentions it at times when he is washing his hands or emptying the potty.  He says that's what the video tells him to do.

I do agree the video would work better on older children say 30months and up.  And it is slanted a bit to girls but it sure worked for us.  I highly rcommend it.",1309564800,,1812,3.7733333333333334

But the best part is, the number of accidents has decreased, as she WANTS to use the potty more often.  Of course, there are other factors involved with potty training too (parental involvement, rewards, peer modeling, etc), but the movie made a positive impression on her...and that's all I was hoping for!",1308960000,,582,4.5576923076923075

He just didn't want to do it and was even fearful of the potty due to sensory issues. It was really frustrating to still have a 4 year old pooping in diapers.

When he began working on feeling powerful about his body in occupational therapy, I found this DVD at our local library and he really enjoyed watching it. He'd ask to see it every time he had to go to the potty and would attempt to go on the potty. He really liked the song and just loved saying ""potty power"". After a couple of weeks of watching this video, he's now out of diapers! I realize it wasn't just the video but it helped give the extra motivation and ""push"" that he needed.

After researching on amazon, I order this ""Potty Power"" DVD.

After my daughter viewed this DVD few times, she began going to the toilet seat more often and even began reading books while just idling there for 15-20 minutes. Once she got comfortable with it, we did not put diapers on her the whole day. Over time, she began using the potty more frequently. By now, she is quite comfortable and always calls me or my wife whenever she gets the pee/poo sensation.

We tried candy, bribery, and other DVDs like the Elmo one, but this one finally did the trick! I think seeing real boys and girls using the potty (as opposed to puppets or cartoon animals) is what made the difference.  She LOVES to sing along to all the songs and now happily yells ""I have potty power!"" every time she makes a pee pee or poop on the potty.  Also, seeing the boys and girls throwing their diapers away while singing ""no more diapers for me! I'm a big kid now"" made a big difference. This DVD is silly, but relatable and has lots of catchy tunes that hold my daughters interest. It also explains potty training with detail rather than abstracts.

He had previously gone through the motions of sitting on the potty without actually doing anything. So, today is a major breakthrough with major kudos to ""Potty Power.""  The kids in the video are compelling, as is the female host.  Also, the songs are catchy and inspirational.

What this video does is walk your child though the various stages of using the potty...emphasizing the ideas of:
- being a ""Big Kid""
- saying goodbye to diapers
- what you can do when you are sitting on the potty
- wiping your bottom (emphasizing wiping front to back)
- washing your hands
- wearing underwear

The songs are cute and fun, but they will get stuck in your head!  This helped, as I would sing the little diddys while my son sat on the potty and he loved it.  The kids in the video do a great job, although I'm guessing they are 4 or 5 years old.  Having real kids in the video was the big selling point for me, as I thought my son would relate more to them than a cartoon.

At the end of the video there is a 5 minute clip of potty training tips that is good for any parent to listen to.

I used this video in preparation for our first attempt at potty training.  While I think this video helped prepare my son for our first attempt (he would sit willingly on the potty, but never went - even after five days of trying!) I want to stress that this video is by no means a miracle worker that is going to ensure that your child is potty trained in one to two days (and it by no means makes those promises, either!)

In addition to this DVD, I went ""cold turkey"" with the pull-ups. We had MANY accidents and at times I wondered if she was holding her pee and poop TOO LONG. I worried about her getting a UTI or constipation. I went for about a week doing this, not going ANYwhere outside the house. By golly, she got it.

He still likes to show us when he goes potty, it's a family accomplishment.  I don't know what the difference is between the 2009 & '04 version, but I bought the '09 and we love love it!  Highly recommended.",1270944000,5,626,4.107438016528926
3926234,4,B002H02V9O,"Toilet training is part of the parenting process and while it usually begins in the toddler years, it can take longer with some children than others. Potty Power attempts to speed up the process by presenting a DVD that encourages kids to use the potty and give up their diapers or pull- ups for good. It accomplishes it goal through its potty talk, songs, skit, and upbeat attitude about using the potty. Jessica, the Potty Power narrator, is encouraging and extremely perky. She talks about pee and poop, slang terms for bodily functions, and more while managing to keep a smile on her face throughout. She really wants children to learn to use the potty, and her enthusiasm, hopefully, will carry through to the children who watch the DVD.

This DVD certainly has its usefulness and I know many people who have had great success showing this training session to their young toddlers. But it does get a little corny and many adults will roll their eyes as they listen to the dialogue and the songs. Songs like I'm Proud to Wear my Underwear, Wipe Your Bottom and others are certainly catchy to young children, but even some youngsters will find the material too silly to be true. One of my toddlers is already toilet trained and she laughs aloud when she watches this DVD, due to its silly and often corny style.

Silliness aside, what matters most is the effectiveness of the DVD and from my experience, Potty Power has made a difference. My youngest one likes to repeat the lines she has heard from this DVD and she likes to sing along to the tunes. She has been going on her own, to the potty, so the DVD does seem to be having a positive effect, even if it does get annoying at times.

Potty Power, in spite of its silliness, is an effective means to wean children off their diapers and pull- ups. If you can get past the goofiness of the whole experience, the excessive perkiness of the narrator, and the annoying skit at the end, Potty Power seems to have something going for it. Children will remember the tunes and message, making this DVD a good toilet- training supplement.",1270339200,36,2085,4.56951871657754
3926235,3,B002H02V9O,"Now that my daughter is 2, we are hoping to really ramp up the potty training and get things moving.  She was introduced to it a while ago and knows the concepts, but just doesn't have much motivation.  This DVD is geared more towards older kids, I would say 3 and up - kids who are able to get their pants up and down by themselves and wipe on their own and wash their hands by themselves.  My daughter liked watching the video during the songs, but other than that she did not show much interest.",1268784000,26,498,4.166666666666667

First, the video starts with advertising for the fist 10-15 sec. Then there the instructer singing for the next 10 min. before getting to the subject of potty training. In showing this to my grandson he showed no interest until 3-4th of the DVD which then showed enter-action with the kids in potty training.",1528416000,,435,4.8133333333333335
