8407485,5,B003WQ3RTK,Nice AIDS parable disguised as a horror film. I don't want to give the plot away because this is a one of a kind horror film.,1385683200,,125,3.8461538461538463
8407486,3,B003WQ3RTK,"If your a fan of movies like ""The Room"", ""Troll 2"", or ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Check out this one. This is one to watch with others while with some party favors.",1355875200,,164,4.0
8407487,3,B003WQ3RTK,"I don't know how this movie escaped me for so many years...it is truly an awesome find for any lovers of 70's/80's ""B"" movie trash. It unfortunately seems to now be out of print by code red. The plot starts off  in a small town where a social pariah,accused by the majority of townsfolk of intentionally killing his family,gets attacked by a disease-carrying monster. I'll leave the plot description at that but this movie quickly spins out of control at a dizzying pace. I was able to view a copy and immediately had to own it, can't believe this incredibly weird film has eluded me all these years. Highly recommended for fans of the bizarre!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carrier/dp/B003WQ3RTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carrier</a>",1344643200,,774,5.559322033898305

8407489,1,B003WQ3RTK,"I watched this because it was filmed in a town where I used to live. The Carrier was a waste of time, both for me and for whoever had a hand in it. Bad acting, bad script, bad editing, this film has it all!",1299196800,,206,3.7045454545454546
8407490,4,B003WQ3RTK,"Carriers is a mixed bag of horror, comedy and bad acting. Overall though its a decent story with ridiculous dialogue and events. The first time i saw this i couldn't really believe what i was seeing. Its starts off fairly normal like most B-horror movies, then goes off the deep end. before you know it you have garbage bag wearing factions fighting over who gets the cats... if that doesn't intrigue you i don't know what will.
