8156403,5,B000KGGMLK,"LEGAL PAIN: Mastering the Art of Pinning.
Four DVD Selection, Revised, Expanded and Updated.

Wrestling is a fundamental ""fighting"" discipline.  It has been my personal experience that possessing a working understanding of the basics of this discipline--stance, motion, level change, penetration, lift and finish--is the first step toward developing a strong and effective ground ""game,"" be it in any sporting application or in a genuine combat situation.

In this high-energy, information-rich four DVD production from [...] the Master of the Pin, Wade Shalles provides basic wrestling instruction intricately woven into highly advanced, yet simple to understand format, designed for learning to control the man on the mat, facilitating a pin in wrestling or a submission in MMA.

What you will not see in this offering are methods of taking an adversary down, however, you will discover numerous sound measures for dominating the man once down, including how to turn the man, how to lock him up, in effect, negating the opponent's offensive maneuverability.

Yes, this video series was originally designed to specifically address the issue of pinning at the High School and Collegiate level.  What is genuinely unique about this expanded and update version is that disc number 4 reviews all of the materials in the previous three dominating/pinning series and amalgamates these fundamental wrestling actions into a comprehensive summary of how to use these basic wrestling moves for position dominance leading into extremely painful submission-like maneuvers that possess utility for mixed martial arts, submission grappling and Catch-wrestling.

Yes, one must have at least a working understanding of the basics of wrestling, that is, we must know how to execute a basic wrestling stance, know how to move with level change and a good penetration step for the basic single leg, high crotch, and double-leg takedowns.  This video production does not discuss or teach one such basic material.  But for those who have a working knowledge of these wrestling basics, a universe of opportunities and novel ideas will present themselves for developing a masterful ground game of dominance, pinning and submissions.

Wade Schalles' high-energy, intelligent style of teaching makes learning easy because it is as fun as it is technically detailed, yet so easily remembered.  Schalles keeps things simple, yet he never leaves anything to be assumed.  Watching and studying and practicing the materials on these four discs will allow one the opportunity to build a tremendous base of ground grappling skills second to known.

Stratgeically sound, tactically appropriate for the mat, Wade Schalles articulates and demonstrates such basics of mat wrestling, explaining his clock theory and tree theory for controlling a man, plus other mat wrestling essentials as nelson's, whizzers, chicken wings and bar-arms, spiral and blanket rides, breakdowns and legs-in, and headlocks, rolls, cradles and splades and the fundamentals of leg wrestling.

For those wrestlers wanting a higher degree of skill for dominating the downed man for pinning wins and for the Judoka or the Brazilian Jiu Jitsuian wanting a deeper understanding of mat wrestling or for the MMA athlete merely wanting to perfect his ground game to a higher level of competition, this video series is a steal and much needed instructional aid.

Regardless, any grappler for any reason cannot go wrong obtaining this DVD selection.  It's truly an encyclopedia of wrestling wisdom from one of the all time greats in competition wrestling and the greatest all time pinner to date.
