Ball State, a Goliath disguised as David, continues its strong NCAA Tournament by taking out another highly ranked and highly regarded opponent. Louisville becomes the second victim, joining Oregon State from the first round. Ball State suffocates a seemingly disinterested Louisville, who never led or tied, right out of the gate and then withstands their late second half surge to earn the victory. Ball State's season would end in the regional semifinal but only after they pushed UNLV, the eventual national champion, to the brink of elimination. In doing so, they were the only team to come close to the Runnin' Rebels in the entire tournament. A team definitely better than the Cinderella tag everyone was so eager to label them with.
The most talented player on the floor this day was probably Louisville's Jerome Harmon. Could possibly have been Ball State's Chandler Thompson but, still, probably Harmon. Harmon was an Indiana high school phenom who surrendered his freshman season(1987-88) to PROP 48 and then missed 1988-89 due to injury. He showed flashes of brilliance during the 1989-90 season that hinted at his unlimited potential and gave cause to think the upcoming season(1990-91) held great promise. Sadly, this was his last game for Louisville. He was declared academically inelgible for the 1990-91 season and never played again. Another one of those lost talents to the basketball wasteland.",1309219200,,1449,5.25

UNLV's only real test of '90 tournament. Great game from the best tournament ever, the 1990 tournament. Highly recommended if you collect these NCAA games.",1206662400,,301,4.69811320754717
