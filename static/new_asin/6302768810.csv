2720737,5,6302768810,"Jaume Collet-Serra has done excellent job in directing this action thriller that takes place in a plane at 40,000 feet.  The premise is simple. An unknown terrorist threatens to kill a passenger every 20 minutes unless 150 million dollars is transferred to an off-shore account.  U.S. air marshall Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) must try to save the passengers and the plane before time runs out. The movie moves at a nice pace with a non-stop suspense that keeps the audience guessing 'til the end.  Easily one of the best action suspense thrillers in the past year.  My wife wants this in our film collection.",1393632000,2,605,4.788461538461538
2720738,4,6302768810,"All in All, ""Non-Stop"" is a good watch.  Just like with ""Taken"" it's Liam Neeson in a realistic danger situation, only this film's danger level is higher by having it set on an airplane.  Liam Neeson isn't trying to save his daughter.  He's trying to save passengers on a plane from a killer onboard.

Liam Neeson brings in a very good performance as alcoholic air marshal Bill Marks.  Julianne Moore is in the movie too and she's great as always.  The action is cool and the PG-13 doesn't restraint the fun of it at all.  You got fighting in bathrooms and zero gravity shootouts.  The whodunnit mystery story is very entertaining and the director keeps the killer's identity unpredictable.  I say give it a watch.  Either rent it or see it if it's still out in theatres. Fasten your seatbelt and enjoy the flight.

Grade: B",1393632000,,824,4.575342465753424
2720739,4,6302768810,"I was worried due to the negative reviews that mentioned huge plot holes. But aside from one large one - more of a matter of believing they could work out the murders at 20 minutes exactly - the rest was non-stop suspense and action. There are twists and turns and surprises to keep you guessing and watching the whole time.

Interestingly, the ""stock"" tropes of a flawed hero, namely Williams' alcoholism and smoking, become plot points, used against him and helping him discover something important. There are some other smarts in this movie as well.

* Very vague spoiler alert * The bad guy's motivation is pure PC, and somewhat ridiculous. But if you can ignore it and substitute a better, more realistic plot point instead - not that hard to do - it's really not too annoying (I just ignored it as Hollywood idiocy) and should not detract too much from enjoying the rest of it.

Very entertaining.",1393632000,3,903,4.666666666666667
2720740,4,6302768810,"I go to movies to be entertained and I am a suspense, action, CGI and 3D junky. Non-Stop is truly a non-stop suspense, action film and there are great special effects. The audience was kept on the edge of their seats with excitement and suspense while trying to figure out ""whodunit.""  I was in a theater where people applauded the entertainment they received. It has been a very long time since hearing an audience applaud. I was thoroughly entertained.

And, I don't care what has been said about him, Liam Neeson is at the top of his game!  I loved this film.",1393632000,3,562,4.490196078431373
2720741,2,6302768810,"Saying Bill Marks is a grizzled man is a bit of an understatement. The blurry opening of ""Non-Stop"" reveals a scraggly Liam Neeson with sloppy hair and a scruffy beard. Bill looks like he's pulled six all-nighters in a row as he takes another swig of liquid courage from a coffee mug in his attempt to drown out the world around him. You also notice him admiring couples and seemingly hating technology; cell phones in particular. He glares at cell phones with such discontent that you can't help but think that about the character. After retrieving the bear of a little girl flying solo for the first time and revealing his fear of flying to the peculiar woman sitting next to him named Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), Bill makes his way to the restroom, slaps duct tape over the smoke detector, lays his weapon and everything in his pockets neatly on the table, and calms his nerves with some nicotine. It's at this point where it's revealed Bill is actually an air marshal. You have to plow through the film to hear the rest of Bill's story, but in actuality it's all a gigantic waste of time.

Things don't really get too ridiculous until Austin Reilly (Corey Stoll), a passenger who is also an NYPD officer, opens his mouth. Not only is he the epitome of New York stereotypes, but he also shares the key scene in which the action thriller takes a turn for the worst. Reilly says something along the lines of, ""What are you gonna do?"" Bill, with his gun crammed in Reilly's neck, replies, ""From one cop to another, you know."" What's disappointing is that even the action scenes aren't impressive. There's a fist fight in the bathroom that is the closest thing to anything remotely rewarding in the film, but you honestly just find yourself trying to choke back jokes regarding Liam Neeson joining the mile high club. On a slight upside, the way the film utilizes a broken phone into the texts that are shown on-screen is slightly amusing.

The rest of the time is just devoted to Liam Neeson defying logic and saving the day solely because he's Liam Neeson. He leaves a trail of dead bodies on an airplane and none of the other passengers ever find any of the victims or stumble onto them. A good portion of the passengers left alive are beaten to a pulp thanks to Bill as he slams them around the plane and resorts to beating a teacher and a lawyer before suspecting the few people left who still trust him. He shoves Tom Bowen (Scott McNairy) around the plane with his arm pinned to his back and seems to use the poor guy as a ventriloquist dummy. The climax takes ludricousness to an entirely new level. It culminates with Neeson firing his weapon and hitting its mark in zero gravity in slow-motion with a plane missing half of its exterior as it dives to 8,000 feet.

""Non-Stop"" is unbelievably bad, which is really unfortunate since Liam Neeson is perfectly capable of delivering the goods. When crashing the plane is the only answer to a hijacked plane, when piling all of your luggage onto a bomb is the only solution, and when a heart condition is used to explain why someone likes the window seat, then ""Non-Stop"" is the answer. Now if the theme song to ""Team America: World Police"" had just played over the end credits, then this might have been somewhat worthwhile. What you're left with is a film that is reminiscent of ""Transporter 2,"" which is an action film everyone is very satisfied forgetting it actually exists.",1393545600,15,3433,4.587947882736156
2720742,4,6302768810,"Let me begin by saying that Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors  and as far as Im concerned everything he touches turns to pure gold.  He became a full-blown household name after his very skilful work in Schindlers List, but in my book, he will forever be etched in my imagination as Qui-Gon Jinn from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.  Dont get me wrong  hes been apart of some historically terrible movies, including The Phantom Menace, along with films like Battleship, The Haunting, and The Nut Job.  Still, Neesons best work outweighs the duds.  And, even though his role in Non-Stop is far from memorable, he rarely ever fails to entertain.

Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Unknown, House of Wax), Non-Stop stars Liam Neeson as Bill Marks  a U.S. federal air marshal secretly patrolling a commercial airliner from New York to London.  Early into the flight, Marks is sent a text message over a secure channel from someone anonymously demanding $150 million  or someone aboard the plane will die every 20 minutes.

Originally believing it to be a prank from fellow federal air marshal, Jack Hammond (Anson Mount), it quickly becomes clear that the anonymous terrorist is not messing around when passengers are abruptly murdered.  Matters turn even more bothersome when the mystery man behind the plot starts framing Marks  making it look like hes the one doing the hijacking.

With only a handful of people to aid him, including a fellow passenger, Jen Summers (Julianne Moore) and a flight attendant, Nancy Hoffman (Michelle Dockery), Marks attempts to discover who is behind this elaborate plot  while also attempting to stop passengers from turning up dead.  On this plane, though, everyone is a suspect, but when the occupants of the plane all end up having clean records, it makes it that much more for difficult to stop everyone from assuming that hes the real villain.

Not unlike his portrayals in films like Taken or The Grey (where he is also no stranger to a plane), Liam Neeson portrays a cool and calm customer, proving again and again that he is a solid action hero and a complete bad-ass.  More often than not, airplane films all look alike, but casting Neeson is a smart way to add spice to a role that only a handful of Hollywood actors have the power to contribute in such a confined film of this nature.  Hes edgy, methodical, and disciplined beyond belief  and this film is successful because hes in it.  Sure, there are problems with the plot, but nothing thats going to overly ruin the viewing experience.

In typical flawed hero fashion, the story begins depicting our protagonist as loving father  yet possible alcoholic.  Its never a good sign when an officer of the law goes to work after a big swig of hard liquor.  Never the less, Neesons character is obviously trying to drawn his demons or sorrows  possibly even both.  However, even despite the early cocktail, Bill Marks goes through the process of mentally documenting his surroundings, identifying passengers, and successfully helping a frightened little girl board a plan.  Within the first 15 minutes of this film, you can tell that regardless of this mans shortcomings, he can be the difference between passengers living and dying.

While there is very little wrong with the protagonist, the antagonist is a mystery until the climax, much like a Scream horror flick or even another airplane mystery, Executive Decision.  Unlike the Scream films, there is no malicious sounding voice on the other end of the phone.  Instead, viewers must settle for a text-happy passenger that would rather send in his demands rather than verbally jousting with the good guy.  Understandably, it would be much easier to spot a guy talking on a plane than to pick out one of the many texters  yet it severely limits the emotional response when the villain is revealed.  On top of that, the motive behind the ransom is rather unimaginative.  At least in the Scream flicks, the killers always had a personal motive, which is not really the main case here.

The film is cut together quite nice by Jaume Collet-Serra.  He spends a great deal of time focusing on multiple individuals to keep the audience guessing about who is behind the on-flight killings.  Just when you think hes about to be revealed, a minor swerve comes into play and starts the focus on another supporting character.  Speaking of supporting characters, Julianne Moore and Michelle Dockery receive the bulk of the minor character most screen time, although neither really stands out in an acting capacity.  Both are brilliant actors, but this is not the type of film that highlights acting ability.

Overall, Non-Stop is not unlike its title in the sense that the film is rarely ever slow-paced or uninteresting.  To that end, you could easily say the film features non-stop action, even though the action doesnt always come in the form of the usual shoot first, ask questions later mentality.  Some scenes are more thrilling than others, basically depending on how much you care about certain characters when the time comes from them to bite the bullet.  Regardless, there isn't a bad thing to say about Liam Neesons portrayal and when this film hits home video  there will definitely be an open spot waiting on my shelf.  Die-hard fans of Liam Neeson, and even causal action flick lovers, shouldnt hesitate to devote their undivided attention to Non-Stop.

2720743,3,6302768810,"Non-Stop starts out as a surprisingly tense thriller that relies on clever writing to carry it along. The film teases the audience with hints about Bill Marks's (Liam Neeson) past, some obvious and some subtle, to get us on his side. Once Marks receives the first fateful text message (""Are you prepared to do your duty tonight, Bill?""), Non-Stop is also frustratingly successful at bewildering the audience- just like it bewilders Marks. Who is sending the messages? Who can Marks trust? How is the perpetrator always one step ahead? I was so torn over who to suspect I even began to wonder if Marks had just lost his marbles!

Again, the first hour or so of Non-Stop is beautifully written. The suspense is incredible (in large part due to the writers' preservation of plausibility... for awhile), and the audience is firmly behind Marks, though we are simultaneously sympathetic to the passengers who, not knowing anything more than what they see, admirably plan to take matters into their own hands. There are other clever tidbits sprinkled throughout, such as the inanity of the pundits on the news broadcast.

So why three stars, then?

Simple: the last fifteen minutes of this film is so silly in comparison to the first hour+ it is almost unfathomable. It's like the filmmakers realized they hadn't tapped most of their budget yet; the obvious solution, of course, was to then insert a slew of crazy action scenes that require expensive special effects and to fulfill a bunch of action movie stereotypes along the way for good measure. Nevermind that the intelligence we were treated to in the first half of the film has already bailed out of the aircraft.

I like to keep my film reviews as spoiler free as possible, so I don't feel comfortable going into any more depth about the plot. However, I will say that Liam Neeson's undeniable charisma as a lead is on full display in Non-Stop, so fans of him are guaranteed to dig it. This is one of those solid films that is worth watching but ultimately leaves the audience longing for what could have been. Nevertheless, I did enjoy Non-Stop and can confidently recommend it both to fans of Neeson and fans of the genre (suspenseful action-thriller). Just be prepared for the out-of-place Hollywood finale.",1393459200,5,2262,4.837209302325581
2720744,4,6302768810,"* Do you like movies about airplanes in jeopardy?
  * Do you like edge-of-the-seat thrillers?
  * Do you like to see smart people try to outsmart smart people?
  * Do you like Liam Neeson? (He has become America's most unlikely action hero. Stallone and Schwarzenegger should take notes: NO plastic surgery and no phony white teeth!)

If you answered ""Yes"" to any or all of the above, have I got a film for YOU!

This time Neeson is a U.S. Air Marshall who, after an airliner is over the Atlantic, receives a text message on a secured network advising him that one passenger will die every 20 minutes until $150M is transferred to an off-shore account. And that is just the beginning of this twisty white-knuckle ride!

We watch:
  * Liam Neeson (""Taken 1 & 2"") is our hero, a bit the worse for the wear, but a smart, resourceful agent, who can only watch as he is brilliantly framed. We in the audience were as frustrated as he!
  * Julianne Moore (""Don Jon"") is the agitated gal who negotiates for the seat next to our hero.
  * Michelle Dockery (""Downton Abbey"") is the chief flight attendant: wary, watchful and determined to protect her passengers.

There are so many suspects, we were as muddled and terrified as our hero, but I have never before been in an audience where a MAN screamed. I was glad he did so I didn't have to!

This amazing PG-13 script was written by John W. Richardson and Christopher Roach; it has very little profanity, an intense plot plus some fisticuffs and gunfire. Director Jaume Collet-Serra (""Unknown"") held our attention from the first frame. Most of the story takes place on the airliner, so he had to be creative to keep us focused.

As someone who only has flown small aircraft, I am no more than a lay person, so if there are plot holes in this cleverly crafted script, I didn't spot them. The screening audience applauded and the buzz was noticeable as we exited the theater. Do not miss this thrilling movie!

I love knowing there are such diverse reactions to the same movie. It really IS different strokes for different folks. Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available so I can tell my JayFlix.net people.",1393286400,143,2155,4.55064935064935
2720745,1,6302768810,"In many ways ""Non-Stop"" is a collage of all Airport movies ever done... and a bad one! Liam Neeson plays the same character like the tough daddy on ""Taken"", the only difference is that he is on an airplane this time. The script has more whole that the fuselage of this airline by the end of the feature. The visual effects remind me of really cheap B movie. This is Hollywood trying to cashing in on a franchise that should had ended five movies ago. Non-Stop is not a disaster movie, it's a disaster of a movie!",1391990400,13,512,4.288659793814433

When I ordered this tape I was hoping it was something I had seen back in the late 80s or early 90s where one of Kevin Pollack's bits was about Brian Boitano at the Winter Olympics.  Unfortunately that show must have been one of the hour long comedy specials on HBO.  This tape is not his best work by any means, but it does have a few funny moments.

My suggestion is to avoid this one and see if you can get a DVD copy of the HBO show.  It is hilarious.",1198713600,,587,4.017241379310345

2720824,1,6302768810,"Wow. This movie was incredibly disappointing and ridiculous. It was reasonably good until the final 20 minutes or so. Not to say that it was totally realistic. In fact there were several inconsistencies and impossibilities throughout the film but they were relatively insignificant. The film was salvageable had there been a good cohesive ending. The ending though, totally destroyed the movie. It made no sense whatsoever. The perpetrator in the movie, once divulged, went off on some ridiculous diatribe explanation stating: that his father was killed on 9/11, and so he joined the military to avenge his father's death, but later realized the truth of the war. Except the truth of what actually happened and who perpetrated 9/11 (Zionists) vs. what he believes, don't mesh. He continues by criticizing the police state after 9/11, not because it was enacted under a false guise, and is unnecessary, but because it doesn't go far enough. It can't protect us. Air Marshalls can't protect us (apparently), as evidenced by his [impossible] attack on the plane. Postulating that we as a nation need better and more protection (i.e. - an even greater authoritarian police and security state). What are the producers and financers of this film trying to implant in our minds? Should we give up even more of our liberties? Are they also Zionists? This is scary stuff. The plane then makes an impossible descent after a massive bomb goes off, and gets down from 35,000 feet to 8000 feet in like 30 seconds, and then from 8000 feet to land in like 10 seconds. Then the pilot lands the [crippled] plane perfectly, given the situation, with no deaths and no casualties. Do the writers/director/producers think people are stupid?

 The correctly named Non-Stop is a tight, taught, tense action movie with the always impressive Liam Neeson as the flawed hero.

Your life as a passenger is in the hands of two Sky Marshalls.  One of them is a criminal and the other is a psychically broken alcoholic.  Big problems, no?

2721332,5,6302768810,"There are two aspects to this review. The first is the movie itself. It is a fantastic action movie with great chemistry between Moore and Neeson, a chilling backstory, and just the right atmosphere to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film. I would highly recommend it, and among other Neeson films I would put it ahead of 'Unknown' but under 'Taken.'

However, the quality of the product I received is on the opposite end of the spectrum. While it DID include the paper slipcover, a nice touch, the physical blue plastic case had a huge gash across the front and the plastic on the inside was shattered. With that being said, the Digital HD redemption slip, the DVD, and the Blu-Ray Disc were all completely fine, with no scratches or anything. If there had not been a slipcover included I likely would have returned the product, but it covers up the damaged case well enough for it to not be an issue to me. I'd still give it 5 stars.",1466121600,,959,4.448863636363637

2721337,3,6302768810,"There are films which you definitely have to see in the cinema and some which can easily wait till they arrive on Sky or TV.'Non-Stop' starring Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore, I'm afraid, comes under the latter.
Liam Neeson stars as US Federal Air Marshal Bill Marks who, on a flight to London, starts receiving texts from someone on board threatening to kill passengers unless millions of dollars are paid into a specific account. When, in a roundabout way, the texter makes good their threats Bill has to do all he can to find out who it is and protect the other passengers.
The title describes the flight they are on more than the action in the movie, as it was surprisingly sparse. There were though some good moments and some clever visual effects, especially as the text messages being received are displayed on screen.
Following his success as an action hero in Taken and it's sequel, Liam Neeson does a good job in this movie too however the action is not as gripping as one would hope. The resolution and discovery of who the 'texter' is a bit of an anti-climax actually and it doesn't leave the viewer leaving the cinema still thinking 'WOW, I didn't see that coming' as a good whodunnit/thriller should, it actually made me think 'Oh really, is that it?' Unfortunately the story makes little sense especially when the texter's identity and motives come to light.
There are a couple of good fight scenes and Liam Neeson has taken the role of 'action-hero' pretty well.
In all Non-Stop isn't non-stop action or a clever whodunnit style thriller either, having said that it isn't a total bore either.",1465430400,,1608,4.705673758865248

2721705,4,6302768810,"I've always loved action movies involving planes. You're in a tube and breathing recycled air, what can possibly go wrong? How many plots can producers come up with? Neeson played his role well especially in action movies. The plot, twists and turns kept me guessing and interested. There has been many action movies involving planes, but the producers came up with some new ideas. Watch it, it's not bad.",1441065600,,405,4.884057971014493
2721706,4,6302768810,"The action thriller Non-Stop takes place almost entirely onboard a passenger jet during a transatlantic flight.  Liam Neeson plays Bill Marks, the undercover US Air Marshall who, to his surprise, starts getting text messages on his supposedly secure cellphone, apparently from someone else aboard the plane.  These taunting messages are demanding a huge cash transfer to an international bank account, threatening to kill a passenger every 20 minutes his demands aren't met.  Marks initially thinks the calls a hoax but begins quietly taking steps, in concert with several of the plane's staff, to try and trace the call and also to secure the flight as much as possible.  Unfortunately their efforts fail and Marks is left with a dead body on his hands and the knowledge that the calls are no prank.

The situation escalates rapidly, with Marks failing to convince (via phone) his superiors in Washington to simply meet the unknown terrorist's demands, at least until they can determine who he is and how he's doing this.  Trying to get a hold on a rapidly deteriorating situation, marks ends up practically taking control of the plane, issuing orders and handcuffing potential suspects.  It's at this point that the passengers and crew begin to think this is all actually a hoax on the air marshall's part, and that he's the real blackmailer.

Neeson is great in roles like this, and uniformly high caliber performances by the rest of the cast are just as important.  Fast-paced and puzzling, it maintains an almost non-stop (no pun intended) high wire of danger and tension, and the technical aspects of the movie are all top-notch.  The only possible flaw is with the resolution and how things are explained out.  Is it an 'impossible' sequence of events?  No, not impossible, but pretty unlikely, at least unless the villain is psychic and can predict exactly how every person is going to react and exactly how every small happening is going to play out.  There have been lots of less likely situations in similar movies though, and Non-Stop is just done so well and so riveting that it makes it easier to allow for some suspension of disbelief.  I'd give it about an 8.5 or 9 out of 10.",1440979200,,2192,4.85752688172043

2721805,5,6302768810,"For Sheer Entertainment value - It's a FIVE.
Former Cop 'Bill Marks' (Liam Neeson) now an Air-Marshall has little in the way of
self esteem these days, events of the past has left him a shadow of his former self.
He's on a routine Flight from 'New York' to 'London'
The Marshall receives a Text from an unknown passenger, a threat is made, the
mysterious caller says he will kill a passenger in 20 minutes time, unless the sum of
150 million U.S dollars is deposited into a designated account within the given time.
'Bill' has to step-up to the mark, he desperately tries to identify the source, however
with the absence of a suspect what can he or indeed the crew do, they have a situation,
arrange the deposit or suffer the consequences.
Early on he believes he's identified the threat, however the Text's keep on coming.
He engages the observational skills of stewardess 'Nancy'(Michelle Dockery) and 'Jen
Summers' (Julianne Moore) who had sat next too, 'Bill' earlier on in the Flight.
Circumstances turn on 'Bill' he becomes a suspect himself.
The situation becomes increasingly desperate and intense as time runs out, passengers
are becoming agitated, realizing there is a problem, but having no answers.......just when
you think it can't get any worse.....
An enjoyable tense affair, set, 40,000 feet high and at 500 miles per hour.....a roller coaster
ride indeed, watch this, you may never want to fly again ?

* Suspense at 40,000 feet featurette.

There's a scene where Neeson has to convince the passengers to trust him.  He goes on to explain his family problems, his career troubles, his alcoholism and the whole thing sounds just a like a real human being!  Wow.

I was too busy watching to detect a political conspiracy but you might as well know...this is one of those stories where some of the good guys turn out to be bad guys, and some of the bad guys turn out to be good.

2721912,4,6302768810,"This movie stars Liam Neeson as a Federal air marshal, Julienne Moore as the passenger next to him, and Michelle Dockery (Mary in Downton Abbey) as a stewardess.  Basic plot: someone has an elaborate set-up to extract 140 million dollars or else bring down the entire plane in a way that makes it look like Neeson is responsible.  Neeson is a great target since, after the loss of his daughter, he became an alcoholic and was almost fired from his job already, making it easy for the higher-ups to believe that hes the one responsible.  Neeson once again proves hes not too old to star in an action film and do it plausibly.  Weve seen this basic type of plot before: the unique setting of a confined space, some 30,000 feet above ground lends an especially claustrophobic and dangerous feeling to the violence, including the threat of all the passengers losing control and rioting.  Im surprised this film managed PG-13, but once again it confirms that the rating agencies consider violence far less damaging to young minds than any hint of sexuality.  Somehow I still think they have it all wrong.  In any case this was a great action-suspense film, with Neeson very much in the lead, on-camera almost every scene, as he desperately tries to figure out who is responsible for setting him up, whether there really is a bomb on the plane, and how to stop a disaster, while almost everyone is working against him: the passengers start believing he's the hijacker, the TSA and Homeland Security and Defense Department think he's the hijacker, his co-marshal on the flight very conveniently (or inconveniently) ends up dead, etc.  Don't want to spoil more of the plot, but the POV is very much Neeson's, and I felt it realistically conveyed the sense of paranoia when you don't know who on-board you can trust and who is a possible terrorist or hijacker.

2722157,3,6302768810,"Well, let's see.  We have an ex-NYPD alcoholic on a multi-year pity party who's now an air marshal aboard a transatlantic flight.  Once the flight is well underway over the ocean he begins receiving texts from a perp who swears to take one passenger's life every 20 minutes unless $150 million is placed in a trust account under the air marshal's name.  So the marshal must find the perp--even though the passengers and crew and officials on the ground think the air marshal is the culprit--to put a stop to the series of killings taking place aboard the plane. . .AND save the 150 passengers from a bomb planted in HIS briefcase.  He whacks a dude in one of those tiny airplane restrooms and flies horizontal through the air shooting his pistol at one of the perps and even karate chops several fellow passengers attempting to subdue him.  And (surprise, surprise) he ultimately triumphs to show one and all what a hero he is.  Of course, it's all trite and silly and lame and so clich-ridden you can set your watch to it, yet NON-STOP is still a fun action romp that will make you wonder what filmmakers will have Liam Neeson doing next.  Perhaps beating up a meteor to save Planet Earth?

In the twilight of his career, Neeson appears to be breaking the mold playing ticked off tough guys, but here he pulls it off in grand, over-the-top fashion.  Julianne Moore co-stars as one of the few passengers who actually sticks with Neeson throughout the plot's ordeal, and following this film's predictability, Neeson's character even suspects her for a brief moment.  The remaining cast is forgettable, with formidable actress Lupita Nyong'o dreadfully under-used, yet NON-STOP still delivers as a seat-squirming action thriller.  If only director Jaume Collet-Serra had had Neeson landing the darned plane. . .

Overall, to me it was very similar to Passenger 57 or the myriad of other 1990s airplane movies. If you like that genre, you'll like this movie. If you don't, you likely won't.  It's an action movie where they try to do some character development, on Neeson mostly.  There are a few plot twists, as usual.

I loved Taken and I was expecting something like that and it wasn't up to that level in my estimation but still a good Neeson movie if you like the actor.",1423785600,,659,4.368852459016393

The cast led by Liam Neeson (solid as usual as Bill Marks) is great. The directing by Jaume Collet-Serra is great. The story by John W. Richardson & Christopher Roach & the screenplay by Richardson, Roach & Ryan Engle is great.

The prosthetic effects designed by Bill Terezakis is great. The special effects supervised by Jeff Brink & coordinated by Shane Gross is great. The visual effects supervised by Randy Goux, Joaquin Gutierrez, David Heras, Jim Rider & Richard Yuricich, coordinated by Cat Counsell, Mithil Kotwal, Zuzana Mikus, Kevin Sheldon Saldanha & Mark Van Ee is great. The stunts coordinated by Jery Hewitt & Mark Vanselow, fights coordinated by Vanselow & choreographed by Rafael Kayanan is great.

This is a great, action/suspense thriller that is entertaining, well-done (as well as, well-made) and well-crafted. Liam Neeson is solid as usual in another one of his recent action films, which is possibly, one of his better action films. He also leads a solid supporting cast with Julianne Moore (as Jen Summers).

I seriously never tire of watching Liam Neeson in these roles (I get unabashedly giddy every time a new ""Taken"" is announced), and he certainly does not disappoint in ""Non-Stop.""  The writers did an amazing job with a story in which you are constantly questioning who the actual villain is, which at more than one point they lead you to believe might even be Neeson himself, and you can never quite shake that shadow of doubt.

The supporting cast is just as much a part of this movie's appeal, with Julianne Moore (as her usual charming self), Michelle Dockery, and Corey Stoll sporadically muscling their way to the forefront, all the while casting doubt on their own motives.  My only strike against it (and it might just be my mood today, because it's not a make-or-break kind of complaint) is that it doesn't truly reach a climax of epic proportions like it seems to build up to - but that's understandable because the entire movie takes place inside an airplane, so you can't exactly build up much larger than that.

It seems Neeson has almost accidentally stumbled into a genre that the movie going public is,in ever increasing numbers,liking him in. The tough guy,save the day type. It certainly suits him and he plays it well. Non-Stop is no different, as he and his good cast mates deliver the goods from beginning to end.
The story finds Air Marshall Neeson reporting for yet another flight that he doesn't want to be on. Neeson is an ex NYC cop whose daughter passed away at a young age from Leukemia. He has lost his wife,is a professed alcoholic and is barely hanging on personally. Once on board and in the air,Neeson starts receiving text messages from an unknown passenger stating that they want $150 million in an account number(that is given),or else one person will die every 20 minutes. Who is it and why are they doing it?
Neeson notifies the captain of the plane and they start out playing it cautiously,with Neeson buying for time,trying to pinpoint the culprit. With 150 passengers it is a tough slog. Neeson touches base with a fellow air marshall,who it turns out later is involved in the shenanigans. The two wrestle in a bathroom and Neeson ends up breaking the others neck when the other tries to shoot him.
But the texts don't stop!? Obviously he was not working alone. That was the first murder. Next comes the captain of the plane,who is inexplicably poisoned. Then another passenger, a suspect at that moment, is also later poisoned. Neeson accidentally discovers that a small epi-dart was used to kill both the captain(from a hole in the wall behind the pilots cabin) and the then suspect.
With a lot of false leads and virtually everyone under suspicion, Neeson is at wits end, when a bomb is suddenly activated. Neeson recalls the suitcase his fellow air marshall brought on board. He retrieves it and enters the bathroom. First he not only discovers it was full of Cocaine, but also a bomb is hidden within it. It is set to detonate within 30 minutes. By now the outside world has been made aware of the problems on board the plane. However the news outlets are calling Neeson the hijacker,thanks to some slanted videos being shot and uploaded by a young passenger. And that money account? It turns out it was Neeson's own!
Neeson continues to communicate with the co pilot in his locked cabin. He asks that he descend to 8,000',where the pressure will equalize and minimize any damage the bomb may make if it goes off. However the British air force is flying alongside and they are adamant the plane will obey their every command.
At this time two more suspects reveal finally reveal themselves. One was a man he  already had in custody but let go, and the other was a gent he had talked to earlier and had actually gotten to help locate the suspect via a viral text message,or so he thought. It seems they are two ex army guys who think security against terrorism is a joke,and they want it known throughout the world. Neeson was just a fall guy for their plan. Neeson convinces one to shut off the bomb via his phone,but is shot dead by the other.
It is now time to cut bait and go fish,as the pilot makes an emergency drop to the safe level. With all the commotion/distraction,this gives Neeson the time to finally take the guy out. As they arrive at the safe level,the bomb indeed explodes. Neeson,with the help of passengers has already taken steps to buffer the explosion with luggage and has gotten all passengers to the rear. The plane descends for a landing on an airstrip in Iceland. The landing is of the white-knuckle variety, but in the end most all are safe and sound,thanks to the air marshall. The film ends as Neeson and Moore,a fellow passenger turned friend,talk of their next destinations.
The film has a grittiness to it from the start as we are introduced to Neeson's unkempt character. As the movie progresses we learn alot more about his personal life and why he is who he is. Even the plane taking off shows Neeson's idiosyncratic nature as he is scared of the take offs,making him more human and making us empathize with him just that much more. Once he gets his first text from someone unknown,the tension of the film never abates until the plane is on the ground. There are,as is usually the case is such movies,many,many red herrings. Everyone is a suspect,and not only is there a countdown every 20 minutes,but this leads to an even bigger one later when the bomb is set to go off. All his cast mates support Neeson wonderfully,and his intensity never waivers,which really is the film's big selling point. Without it the film could not have been as good as it was.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. The only extra is a short featurette on its making.
All in all a top notch high in the sky thriller. Most of it due to Neeson's intensity and the wonderful script and editing which keeps you on the edge of your seat trying to figure out,along with Neeson's character,exactly who is trying to do what and why. There is not a lost moment anywhere. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1420329600,,5177,4.650655021834061

Liam Neeson does an amazing job at playing Bill Marks. Bill mark is on a flight to London when he starts to get encrypted text messages. He is getting black mailed to move $150 million to an off shore account. If he doesn't someone on the plan will die every 20 minutes.

2722780,4,6302768810,"As I get dragged kicking and screaming into my dotage, it's been awesome and even inspirational to see Liam Neeson commit full bore to his late-career action roles, from the TAKEN movies to THE UNKNOWN to A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES to this one. In NON-STOP Neeson, endowed with old man strength and imposing height, stalks the aisles like a righteous force of nature. He moves with power and speaks with authority and it's obvious HE HAS LIVED A LIFE. During a non-stop, six-hour transatlantic flight from New York to London, his boozy character, Bill Marks, gets framed as a terrorist, never mind that he's the designated U.S. Federal Air Marshal for that flight. It begins with Marks' reception of a string of cryptic text messages vowing to murder a passenger every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred into an off-shore account. His mind fogged with alcohol and sorrow, can he work thru 150 passengers and no end of red herrings and everyone's doubting his ability to isolate the aspiring serial killer?

Plonk Liam Neeson in an action movie and I'm there, son. NON-STOP is ridiculous and far-fetched and what of it? Neeson is such an invaluable presence and is so watchable and plays his part with such conviction that he gives me license to overlook the film's occasional lapses in real-world logic. No, man, I don't at all buy that the perpetrator can orchestrate his promised deaths with such pin-point timing and precision. And her (his?) motivation, when finally revealed, left me underwhelmed. Truth be told, for most of the film, it's a slow burn whodunit more so than it is an action-packed thriller. And, actually, it's the most fun during those early to mid stages, when Neeson and the anonymous big bad are engaged in their cat-and-mouse game. There's fascination in watching someone as towering as Neeson gradually lose his sh--. But then the third act comes along and there's the tonal shift to straight-up big effects, stunt-crammed sequences. This third act comes across okay but regresses the film into routine blockbuster fare. Still, I recommend NON-STOP. Liam Neeson is the boss. Julianne Moore lends good support as a standoffish frequent commuter who ends up as Neeson's accidental associate 40,000 feet up. And I really liked the added element of how, even though the story unfolds in an enclosed space, modern technology - specifically the smart phone - allows for a global audience to sneak a first-hand peek into the plight of British Transatlantic Flight 10 enroute to London. I guess it's a more interesting watch than the everyday flash mob. And I imagine the welcoming reception at the London airport won't be as giddy as the one in, say, Love, Actually.

He is able to manipulate people on the ground and passengers on the plane to think that Neeson is hijacking the plane, including setting it up that the money would go to an account in Neesons name.

2722820,3,6302768810,"Somewhat disappointing drama for Liam Neeson.  His notable acting skills deserve a better script than this ponderous and predictable cliche' that follows the standard formula of a washed up, burned out security professional who gets dragged out of retirement to summon his once formidable and somehow reflexive skills to, against all odds, unconvincingly rescue and secure a hijacked commercial passenger jet.  I could include a spoiler alert first here,  but it's so predictable, it doesn't really necessitate an alert. The characters of the supporting cast are very confusing and cryptic in their roles - maybe intentionally, maybe not.  But, with the exception of the bad guys, the rest don't really contribute to the plot except as weak diversions.
Oh, and I've never understood the fantasy world of Hollywood martial arts hand combat.  The opponents never seem to have much trouble instantly rebounding from what appears to be repeated lethal blows to face, neck, chest and groin.  In real life, people get sent to the ER in an ambulance for tripping on the stairs or falling off a bicycle.  I guess concussion doesn't exist in action movies.  I know without a doubt, if I sustained one karate chop to the nose like these fighting characters receive in rapid, serial repetition, I'd be on my way to the morgue.  Rather insipid movie with little realism -  I should have passed on this one.",1415923200,4,1394,4.995670995670996

2722891,5,6302768810,"Non-Stop certainly lives up to its name!  It's NON-STOP action!  Just the way I like it.  While it's true the typical hijacking storyline of airplane films has been done a million times by this point and it's a formula that's getting a little old, Non-Stop seems to take that formula and rejuvenate it most likely because Liam Neeson is just *that* good of an actor!  His presence alone gives the storyline new meaning and emotion.  He's of course phenomenal in films like Taken, but Non-Stop arguably is just as suspenseful.

What seems like a harmless airplane ride with a nervous Liam Neeson (which is hilarious in itself- Liam can go around outsmarting and out-tricking all the bad guys with an arsenal of gunshooting and knife skills and yet he's afraid of airplanes during the lifting off period, lol) turns into a MUCH more dire situation as soon as Liam starts receiving text messages on his phone that every 20 minutes someone on the flight will die unless Liam can turn over 150 million dollars.  Seems compelling enough, but the fact that nearly everybody on board seems to take at least a minor role on the plane makes the story even better.  The storyline being REALLY well-written in a Jack Bauer 24-kind of way is another highlight (hey I love that show!)

Everyone from a little child afraid to be on airplanes, to Julianne Moore as a passenger (who's been showing up in a lot of movies lately- by this point she must have a whole overwhelming list of films she's starred in), to a rugged police officer, to a polite Middle Eastern doctor, to the stewardess lady, to the pilots themselves, to a geeky guy with glasses, to the elderly couple... everyone's a suspect!

Anyone who has a phone has to be searched carefully and cautiously.  Gradually throughout the movie Liam -who's an air marshal- must find the culprit and end the death count before it gets any worse.  The problem is, who's actually the one responsible for these deaths?  Someone is able to see and detect Liam's every move!  Certainly the voice isn't coming from someone on board.  However it eventually turns out one or two people might be responsible... and I'm not going to reveal which ones of course!  That would be a really big spoiler.  Anyway people don't know how to interpret Liam since he comes off looking like a mighty suspicious killer so he really has to reach deep within and find a way to win everyone over when he claims he's being set-up and targeted.

Of course you can expect a dramatic landing scene.  That's a given with airplane thrillers.  But... there's a catch.  There's a bomb onboard.  And there's no way to stop it from going off.  You'll have to tune in to see how Liam and company figure a way to handle this situation.

The action-packed flow can't be denied.  I was fully engrossed in this movie from beginning to end.  Liam Neeson is just the perfect man for these kind of roles.  You know, the action hero type.  Though I admit I *almost* thought a swerve was coming in the very beginning and that Liam was actually going to be the bad guy holding an airplane full of people hostage.  It almost ventured in that direction.  Maybe in Liam's next suspense he'll take that route and surprise everybody!",1413936000,,3218,4.634275618374558

2722950,3,6302768810,"After Unknown, Spanish film director Jaume Collet-Serra reunites with Liam Neeson for Non-stop. Those who have seen their previous collaboration will expect something unique from the new thriller set on a flying airplane. Because of the slick storytelling and tons of twists and turns, I believe their expectations will be met, but not fully enough, perhaps.

Liam Neeson plays William (Bill) Marks, a U.S. Federal Air Marshal on a non-stop flight from New York to London. He receives a strange text message threatening to murder one of the people onboard if he does not follow instructions. And Bill Marks soon learns that the sender really means it.

This is a kind of thriller that keeps you guessing while trying to stay one step ahead of you. There are characters onboard Bill (and you) may or may not trust, including Julianne Moores Jen Summers, a passenger Bill marks befriends. Yes, Non-stop begins with an interesting premise, develops it into the tense mid-section, and  fails in the final act, where things get so preposterous that I stopped caring.

Perhaps we should know this is what happens to most, if not all, thrillers with (too) ingenious premises. Thanks to the solid performance from Neeson, Non-stop remains an edge-of-the seat experience, but don't expect logics.",1413590400,,1287,5.085308056872038

A man sits in his SUV and drinks whiskey from a paper coffee cup. He is at an airport. He lights his cigarette and watches a couple outside. His passport is inspected as he boards an airplane to London. He looks at the other travelers. Passengers take their assigned seats in the airplane. A young woman gets a window seat. This two-engine jet plane prepares for take-off. A man talks to his fellow passenger about his work. Its quiet on this night flight. His cell phone displays a text message: someone will be killed on this plane! Unless a $150 million ransom is paid to a numbered check account! Then someone else will die every twenty minutes! [Who done it?] Marks watches the other people in the First Class section. He then talks to the other Federal Marshal on this flight, then to the Captain. Can this threat be validated? Counter-measures are taken. The flight attendant will help to keep watch on the passengers.

Bill talks to his fellow passenger for help in watching. Those who use a cell phone are noted via the video camera that watches the crew. The sender is identified, there is a fierce struggle until Bill wins! [But this movie is only half over.] Then there is another message! Who else is there? There is a surprise on that account trace. Perhaps a hoax? Bill is relieved. But Bill always has to be on guard. The text messages carry the story. [A first for movies?] Bill inspects Hammonds briefcase to see whats there. Nancy is shocked by what she sees! Bill explains the set-up, he needs her help. Bill explains the need for a random search of all passengers for contraband. Some are unhappy. There is another message. Are all the passengers clean? One passenger admits to a prank. There is drama as one passenger is restrained. There is a surprise event! What happened? There is nothing I could do. There is another text message.

The man may have died of poison says the Doctor. Or an anaphylactic shock. Bill reports to his superior about the latest event. His request is denied (it will set a bad example). Who had access to the cockpit? Zack is a programmer for smart phones; he knows how to fix another persons cell phone. The Business Cabin is now closed. Bill promises free travel if the passengers follow orders. [Thats easy for him to say.] Bill asks the co-pilot for a favor. What can the passengers do? What should they do but obey orders? Hands up! A cell phone rings. The man says he never say it! Get a Doctor, now! We hear the reply. Bill finds an item in a lavatory. A passenger answers Bills question. Bill talks to another passenger about her choice of seats. The TV news is seen by the passengers. [Is it reliable?]

The news provides a clue to Bill, he locates the bag that holds a device. Some of the male passengers take action! Is there a bomb on this plane? Bill explains. There is a plan to neutralize the bombs blast. Two fighters escort the plane to its landing zone. Bill explains the plan; will it work? The luggage is piled against the back door. The plane begins its descent to 8,000 feet. Who uploaded that video? There is sudden action when a passenger acts. Is there an accomplice? How easy was it? The man explains his reasons. [We learn about the plan.] Can one man save himself? I wouldnt understand. Oxygen masks deploy! Loose items cascade down the aisles! There is another fight. The co-pilot makes an emergency landing! Are you alright? Jen meets Bill again. Thank you. It depends.

At the end the credits identify the actors with their roles, and the others. This is a very interesting and suspenseful movie. It keeps you guessing as to the guilty persons. This story has unity of time, place, and action. Are some parts questionable? Its a movie, drama not reality.",1412035200,,3756,4.583333333333333

The way his cell phone looks and works is to make the messages more obvious to the audience instead of realistic and that's kind of stupid.  He's led around by the nose throughout the movie (while completely missing clues as to who is involved although he's an Air Marshal who should recognize them much sooner than 90% through the movie) although he pulls some crafty stuff to get the job done by the end.  So I can't give it a really good rating.  I was anticipating the release for months and was let down.  Still eagerly looking forward to the ones he has done since then though.",1411689600,,918,4.461077844311378

Liam plays the alcoholic air marshal with a tragic past. Once airborne, a person or persons unknown message him that one person will die every twenty minutes if $150 million isn't wired to them. The rest of the movie is that being carried out and Liam trying to figure it out.

Those with a fear of flying might want to skip Non-Stop, an airliner-in-jeopardy thriller that could have you taking trains and buses for quite some time to come.

In another of his increasingly frequent action-hero roles, Liam Neeson plays Bill Marks, a U.S. air marshal who discovers that someone aboard a flight from New York to London is threatening to kill a new passenger every 20 minutes until $150 million is deposited into an account that has been set up for the occasion. The twist is that the mystery culprit is making it look as if Marks is the actual extortionist and may even be making Marks carry out some of the killings for him.

Non-Stop works well enough within the limited confines of both the setting and the hostages-held-for-ransom genre of which it is a part. The whodunit plotting unravels at an appropriate pace, with a whole host of possible suspects for us to choose from, including fellow passengers Juliette Moore, Anson Mount (Hell on Wheels) and Corey Stoll (House of Cards ), as well as Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey) and Lupita Nyongo (12 Years a Slave) as flight attendants who demonstrate grace and ingenuity under pressure.

The holes in the plot are probably large enough to fly a 747 through, but you really won't notice or care while you're strapped in for the ride.  And to think, most airlines just provide movies as in-flight entertainment.",1410480000,,1393,4.836134453781512

2723501,4,6302768810,"I love good action movies and Non-Stop is a good action movie. There seem to be an abundance of terrorists-on-the-airplane kind of flicks out there that have been popping up over the last several years, but Non-Stop is actually one of the better ones.  Yes, there's plenty to frown about and absurdities abound as they usually do in the particular kind of venue, but Neeson is such an intense actor, that he often makes the absurd seem at least somewhat plausible.  Neeson plays the role of kind of has-been air marshall who has brought discredit on himself through his drunken binges. His poor rep is constantly used as a foil to work against him as he tries to deal with the bad guys on the plain.  Anyway, if you're looking for some good action, I can easily recommend Non-Stop as a worthy action film to watch.",1409961600,,814,4.561643835616438

8166063,4,6302768810,"Pretty well done, entertainment. Not the best movie, but after it gets moving it holds the attention. Well acted. I have difficulty hearing/distinguishing dialogue in some flicks but this one comes through well for me. We'll keep it. Some rude language, 1 sort of under covers sex scene, a few down shirts shots on a phone screen. Mild stuff for most movies. We appreciated that aspect.",1522022400,,386,4.863636363636363
