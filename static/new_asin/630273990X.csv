Great anime.",1408233600,,198,4.351351351351352
7830368,5,630273990X,"Yes, this truly is a gem. The english version is available on Amazon.com, and god bless Amazon.com for that. I only wish more episodes were available. Starzinger is the swedish version, I own all 6 casettes. Charming, humour, action, sad, yes, sometimes terrifying is Spaceketeers / Starzinger. The cartoon that tells the story of a galactic energy, that makes the world what it is. If this energy were to be detained, or reduced, it would seriously threaten the galaxy. Well, such a thing has happened. Life forms turn into monsters without not being evil in the first place, and evil forces lurk, as princess Aurora and her three lifeguards head out to restore the galactic energy.
The swedish version (Starzinger) is still available, but reducing fast. If they released the whole series on DVD it would truly be a miracle! Let this be a message to, if read by the creators or those responsible for this series, to re-release this series in its full form with soundtrack and all. This way, those of us who know this cartoon, and the unlucky ones who haven't seen it, can see it, again, again, again, for eons, and eons. And eons.",1002672000,10,1131,4.717171717171717
7830369,4,630273990X,"Spaceketeers was a part of the ""FORCE FIVE Show"", produced by Jim Terry, and shown in New England between 1980-81.
FORCE FIVE showed 26 episodes of this japanese animation, and this VHS contains the first two of them, starting with ""Aurora Accepts The Challange"", followed by ""The Invincible Warriors"".
""Aurora accepts the challange"" - An evil energy has begun to spread over the galaxy, and Aurora learns that she is the only one possessing the abilities to neutralize it. Before she begins her journey to the Dekos System - which is the source of this evil energy - she is given a protector: Jesse Dart. He is the most powerful cyborg in the galaxy, but he is also very disrespectful and undisciplined.
""The Invincible Warriors"" - First, Aurora refuse Jesse's help because of his violent tendencies, but will she succeed with her mission without him? After almost getting killed by a grotesque liquid, and saved by Jesse, she realizes that he has to join her on the journey the Dekos, whether she likes it or not. It's just too dangerous to go alone. This is where the journey really begins, with Jesse and Aurora together heading towards the Dekos star system...
The only reason why I gave this title a 4 instead of a 5 is because I think it's a bit too short. There are many good things to say about Spaceketeers... Funny, exciting, sentimental and much more. I think this is the perfect movie for people all ages, and not just kids. So, if you're a parent and order this movie to your kid[~s], don't get surprised if you end up watching it with great enthusiasm yourself! I used to watch on this serie when i was younger, and it really gladden me when i found it on Amazon.",973209600,9,1678,4.578073089700997
