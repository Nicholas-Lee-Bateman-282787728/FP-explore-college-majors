This movie is dedicated to the law officers who fought for law and order in the pioneer days of 1880. Two riders appear, one rides away and is pursued by the sheriff. They wind up in a taverh. The shooting drives people away. The pair will room there until the stage coach arrives. Was there a tip-off to bring them there? ""I'm taking no chances."" We learn about this gang. [Wearing hats to bed?] The bank president visits Clint Yackey in the tavern. The Idaho Kid is head of the law committee in another town. Panhandle Perkins loses a lot of loot at the ""Half Way House"". Was the wheel crooked? [Is there a lesson here?] Two men throw punches in a fight with comedy. Miss Aline Arthur is the new owner of the ""Half Way House"" by inheritance. There is more comedy. We hear about the plot to learn more about the Yackey gang.

The Yackey gang will rob the bank before leaving the area. Miss Arthur is taking over the bank, they will check the cash and books. Robbers come to the bank, they pay off the president, then ride away. Tex chases them and retrieves the loot. Tex uses a trick to set a trap for Yackey's gang. Dave is captured as a robber, he needs Tex Haynes to clear him. But Tex is caught by the Yackey gang. Tex sings a song. Panhandle arrives with news of a little black book with names in it. Yackey sends Miss Arthur to confirm their capture of Tex and give them a time limit of ten o'clock. Will the plan work? Panhandle finally remembers where he hid the identification papers! Next they will go to rescue Tex. But Tex has a plan to escape. The two groups meet and the shooting begins. Will the good guys capture the fleeing villains? Of course.

This is an average story about the use of undercover detectives to catch an outlaw gang. There is too much comedy for this drama. Was it meant to be a parody? Tex Ritter sings in a story about a time limit. ""High Noon"" did this much better. A better story makes a better movie.",1291161600,,1968,4.28494623655914
