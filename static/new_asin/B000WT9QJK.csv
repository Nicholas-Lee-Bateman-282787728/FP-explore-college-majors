8225428,5,B000WT9QJK,"I am a long time fan of anime and manga but a newcomer to the ""yuri"" subgenre.  For those not in the know, ""yuri"" are romantic stories between two young women.  ""Blue Drop"" is a fuses yuri with private school dramas and space operas.  I am particularly fond of the latter genre and that is what lured me into the story.

The story centers around Wakatake Mari, a teenaged schoolgirl who survived a cataclysm when she was very little.  She meets an enigmatic classmate named Hagino who turns out to be a starship commander masquerading as a schoolgirl.  Hagino and her starship, the Blue, were involved in the cataclysm that Mari survived.  The two of them will have to confront an invading alien fleet which the renegade Hagino was once a part of.  If this weren't complex enough, the invading star fleet serves as a backdrop to a second plot involving a hastily written school play that Mari and Hagino have volunteered to perform in.

A ""play within a play"", a story of a lost lover, an alien race comprised entirely of females and a father-daughter drama seem too much to handle in an animated series only 13 episodes long, but ""Blue Drop"" manages to pull it all together into an engrossing, multi-tiered story.

Even more intriguing, the animated ""Blue Drop"" series serves as a PREQUEL to a two volume manga series that takes place one thousand years after the events described above.  [...]",1215648000,3,1395,4.676229508196721
