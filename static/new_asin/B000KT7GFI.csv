8159021,5,B000KT7GFI,"'For Your Love Only' (original title 'Reifezeugnis') is the most successful episode of the popular German/Austrian crime tv-series 'Tatort' ('Crime Scene'). This episode (vol. 73) was produced in the summer of 1976 and first aired on German TV on Sunday-evening March 27, 1977. Definitely not 1970 as stated in the heading! For Your Love Only, with more than 25 million viewers (and the viewers in the neighboring countries were not counted...), still exceeds the level of the more than 700 Tatort episodes broadcasted so far. I would say the sum of a great story, acting performances by a creme-de-la-creme crew, movie directing by Wolfgang Petersen, locations, atmosphere and the film music. A significant contribution to the popularity of this episode is the smashing debut of actor Klaus Kinski's gorgeous and dashing daughter Nastassja as the young student Sina Wolf. Besides her ravishing look, the then 15 years old Nastassja is very natural and acts very professional, despite her young age. A crucial step in her career. For Your Love Only contains brief moments of innocent nudity (no exploitation), presumably a problem in the US. Today the film locations of For Your Love Only are a kind of pilgrimage, as this episode has for decades a 'cult' status. After the broadcast, a lot of (German) parents called their newborn daughter Sina or Nastassja by the way.

The story is about the 17 years old student Sina Wolf (Nastassja Kinski) who has a love affair with her high school teacher Helmut Fichte, age 32. One day Sina's classmate and boyfriend Michael caught the couple intimate at a lake. The jealous Michael also wants to make love with Sina and blackmails her. In the mean time Michael tells his classmate Inge what he has seen. The sub-plot is, that Inge has bad school results and she blackmails her teacher Fichte to give her higher figures. The next afternoon Michael tries to rape Sina in the woods (as part of his blackmail) and during the rape she kills him with a stone. In a newspaper Sina had read an article about a sought rapist with a green jacket, so she frames him for the murder. Detective Finke is suspicious however. Will Sina get away with murder?

Because of her acting performance and her irresistible look, Nastassja Kinski had a lot of media attention (as well as the subject), but I like to mention actress Judy Winter also. She stood in the the shadow of Nastassja, understandable, but she has a lot of screen time too (more than I remember from 1977) and performed her role as a high school teacher and woman of an adulterous husband very well. Perhaps too well, as she understands his adultery; the only weakness in the script in my opinion. Unlike many other Tatort/Crime Scene episodes however, this time the cops are less prominent. I prefer that. Comparing this episode with the many other Tatort episodes I have seen in the past 4 decades, I still think this is one of the best, actually the best!

There is a full length, uncensored German language Youtube upload by the way, search: 'Tatort Reifezeugnis'. In Greece and in the US For Your Love Only was released on VHS; the latter censored. Fortunately, since January 7, 2010, For Your Love Only is available on DVD (German release, title: 'Reifezeugnis'), uncut (108 minutes!) and  this time a decent print. Unfortunately, despite being Tatort's most popular episode and international theatrical release (like France and Turkey), only German subtitles are added. Maybe in the near future we may look forward to a Blu-ray release with subtitles in English language also. And maybe with interviews with the director Wolfgang Petersen ('Das Boot', etc.), the still beautiful Nastassja Kinski and other members of the cast, as extra features...

My ratings: Episode: 4.5/5; DVD (region 2): 4.5/5, VHS (US): 1.5/5.",1342051200,2,3811,4.929906542056075
8159022,3,B000KT7GFI,"Originally a movie made for German television, directed by Wolfgang
Peterson and filmed in 1977, it was later released theatrically in the
US in the mid-eighties after its young star, Nastassja Kinski, had
become well-known. The VHS tape I came upon is poor quality, badly
dubbed (it is so obvious that when the dubbed-in voices are saying
""no"", the actors are really saying ""nein""), but it shows the talent
of young Nastassja, although she is somewhat exploited in some scenes
(sort of par for the course in her early career), in her fresh,
innocent beauty. The film itself is quite unremarkable. Suffice to say that naive Sina Wolf (Kinski) is too young to really understand how her illcit affair with her married schoolteacher will have terrible consequences. It is revealed that her secret admirer wanted to possess her in all ways which leads to tragedy and her desperate attempt to cover it up. In fact, it had me thinking of British and Austrailian crime series like ""Halifax F.P."" and ""Cracker"". Apart from Kinski, none of the other actors are familiar to me, but as I am not well acquainted with German cinema or television, that is to be expected. It is a curiosity piece if you're a fan of Nastassja (as I am) or if you have an interest in German TV or film.",1186099200,3,1269,4.669642857142857
