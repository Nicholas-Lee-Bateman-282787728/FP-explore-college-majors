8266056,5,B0017I1G48,"For convoluted reasons having to do with permissions and copyrights, QI isn't available on US television. (The LA market aired the show for two weeks only, then cancelled it.) Having the DVDs is such a delight. I wish the whole series were available. I've laughed like mad over these. They play just fine on my Acer laptop. You can't go wrong if you like the weird, the outlandish, and the mind-boggling. Great service from UK seller, as well.",1439683200,2,443,4.6923076923076925

8266058,5,B0017I1G48,"EXCELLENT! Fantastic series. Have finished watching everything, and it's more of the same, which means you never know where it's going to go, and that's a very good thing. I'll never get enough of this show, and I can't wait until they release the rest of the series on DVD. Comedians trying to answer ridiculously advanced physics and chemistry questions and sometimes even getting them right, oh my! The best part is that if they occasionally get the facts wrong (as discussed, unegotistically, in the Retractions/Comments extra on the disc) you can choose not to care because it's usually just so much fun to watch. Plus, you get introduced to (if you needed to be) Bill Bailey (! - OMG look him up he's freakin' hilarious), Phil Jupitas, Rich Hall, Sean Lock, and several other fantastic comics.

QI is classic and should be in the collection of any Anglophile or, I suppose, Brit (personally, I am in the Anglophile category).
However, if you are highly religious and don't want to hear anything that suggests you shouldn't be, if you can't tolerate homosexuality (QI's brilliant host is openly gay and often alludes to this fact on the show, and some of the guests are as well and do the same) or if you might get offended or turned off by low-brow humor, no matter how well done, you might want to stay away as the series definitely tends towards atheism and sexual innuendos (which don't always stay within the bounds of innish).

I'm not crazy about the way they did the titles, but it's not a big deal. Another very minor gripe: although I actually liked the Peter Cushing song itself, the vid they put in looked silly-in-a-bad-way to me and I ended up not watching the rest of that particular section. It's a total extra, though, so I didn't feel cheated in any way.

BRING ON SERIES D, BBC! PLEASE!",1407974400,,1810,4.65

too bad they will Not be releasing anymore to dvd-so one has to attain them by Other means",1356825600,5,333,4.107692307692307
