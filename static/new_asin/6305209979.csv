988664,3,6305209979,"You ever remember watching a movie as a young kid and then coming across it down the line ? Well that's the case with this movie,i know that me & my sister both went too see this in the movie theater when i was 9 years old. We thought it was funny and always remembered the name. 15 Years later i come across it on amazon for like 40$ and i thought i wouldn't waste my money. Then about 9 months later i see it's available for 1.99 so i picked it up. Then i kicked back,rolled a J and gave it a shot. Lloyd Bridges is really a funny guy and i thought it was cool too see him in the movie( i had forgotten exactly who was in it) and i guess this was like his last film or one of his last. Well hes the Don of the crime family,and it shows how he grew up and came to be Don with tons of spoofs on Mob movies. Particularly when Don Corleno is growing up you see it's spoofs of the Godfather movies,and the same with the Don's son. You see him grow up and recant the past,and his backstory follows close to that of the movie Casino and little bits of Forrest Gump (that i remembered) But this is kinda like the Scary Movie of Mobster movies. Christina Applegate is in the movie as well as the Don's son's girlfriend i guess then he has to go and get her back. It's still got the same style humor in it that i remembered,but i thought when i was 9 it was alot funnier. Altho i knew i'd be expecting something similar to Hot Shots (the same guy directed it or produced it) but i'd say if you know what your gonna get looking at the trailer,go ahead and pick it up if it's cheap. Don't pay a ridiculous price. 3 stars",1415232000,,1610,3.956923076923077

It brought back good memories as i watched it,and i did get a some good laughs. Its very hilarious,if your into cheap laughs just for the hell of it then this would be the movie for you. A very simple style of comedy, its just like ""airplane"" movie as such ""hot shots"",""naked gun"",etc... very old spoofy (the originals) As opposed to the new spoofys like ""scary movie"", ""super hero"",""meet the spartans"",etc. You totally recall all the movies its making fun of. Which makes it that much more funny. I loved it and would recommend it for one of those nights when there's just nothing to do or watch on tv/cable or cable is out just to have in your collection of movies. However my feelings on this movie is based in sentimental value so you may not connect with it as much as i did. You really got to be in the mood for something goofy!

988823,3,6305209979,"In this ""Godfather"" takeoff, Lloyd Bridges plays Don Cortino, this film's Godfather. The film parodies every major Mafia film and includes some send-offs on others as well. It's slap-stick, haphazard and mostly funny.

It's also low-budget.  It's clear the film's pretty low-budget.  Even I can see the film equipment and props used to create the very special effect in the funeral scene. I don't usually catch these goofs so they are pretty apparent.

Balance the laughter with the bloopers if you can.  The film did not do well in the theatres, but it's fun with a group of friends.  I'd watch this one with a bunch of friends, some pizza, and libations and see what happens.

988824,5,6305209979,"Here's a very funny spoof on ""The Godfather"" story. This is a Leslie Nielsen-type silly parody, except the late Lloyd Bridges played the lead role instead Nielson.

Actually Jay Mohr was more of the lead actor in here, narrating the film and taking Al Pacino's ""Godfather"" role while Christina Applegate took Diane Keaton's character.

There are a number of laugh-out-loud lines in this movie and a number of overdone slapstick scenes. As with any comedy in which the material comes at you at a rapid pace, you get a lot of funny stuff and a lot not-so-funny. They come at you so fast you can hardly keep up.

For added laughs, check out the written material on background buildings, street signs, etc. on this film. You almost have to freeze-frame some scenes to ""read"" all the jokes, but they're worth it.

This movie did do something that Hollywood films rarely have done: poke fun at a Democrat. Usually, the cheap shots are reserved for Republcians (Nixon, Gingrich, Reagan, Bush, etc) but here we have the famous ""But I never had sex with that woman!"" line delivered in a obvious reference to our buddy Mr. Bill.

Also points should be awarded for having several actors from the actual Godfather films make appearances here, too. The film was dedicated ""in loving memory"" to Bridges.  Well, he certainly went out with a laugh.",1235692800,,1332,4.769565217391304
988825,5,6305209979,"Even the name is ridiculous, ""Jane Austin's Mafia"".

He died shortly after completeing his work on his last movie, Meeting Daddy, which was released in 2000. He died on March 10, 1998. This was an extremely funny man and that is more than evident in all the films he made throughout his life. This movie is just an example of how brilliant he was as an actor. He is still missed.",1127692800,,470,4.3522727272727275
988888,5,6305209979,"I would say this is the greatest parody-type comedy ever without Leslie Neilson.  The story about Vincenzo Cortino, who flees Sicily in 1901 for safety by swimming across the Atlantic, and the life of himself and his family.  The plot may be a little confusing, as the movie is changing between past and present, but it does become clear after a while.  Plenty of nonsense, slapstick comedy, with plenty of parodies from the Godfather movies and Casino.  A great movie that you can watch again and again, a must buy for those who love this type of movie.",1123718400,,554,4.622448979591836
988889,3,6305209979,"Best:
1) The sight gags and verbal funnies come fast and furious.
2) Many of the jokes are hilarious and will have you rolling.
3) You get to see classic gangster actors spoofing themselves.
Worst:
1) Some of the stuff was REALLY dumb (as in not funnny dumb).
2) Can you really have too many fart jokes? Yes.
3) There are no special features on the disk.
Recommendation:
If you liked the ""Airplane"", ""Naked Gun"" and ""Hot Shots"" type of movies, then you should like this one too. I say get it due to it's high rewatch value.",1073088000,6,523,4.346938775510204
988890,4,6305209979,"This film is a wonderful compendium of spoofs on the entire gangster genre. Especially look out for the true emotion seen in the face of ATM Man with Double Chin!
The only part I couldn't really buy was a little boy swimming all the way to America from Sicily!! I mean that's not possible!!",1046390400,,290,4.388888888888889
988891,5,6305209979,"I had wanted this DVD for a couple of years! this is one of the best comedies that i have seen in a few years! i love how the whole movie spoofs mob classics like ""The Godfather"". My favorite part is when ""Il Pacino"" leaves Vincenzo Cortino behind. He had to swim to New York from Sicily.
Anyway, I put this DVD on for a couple of friends a few weeks ago and they were laughing throughout the entire movie! My little cousin watched it yesterday and he also enjoyed it!! :-)",1030924800,,473,4.1521739130434785
988892,3,6305209979,"If you love the Godfather trilogy, Casino and Goodfellas you really HAVE to see this movie. Although not everything works in this movie there are some hilarious scenes included.
After purchasing the Godfather trilogy, I knew I had to buy this one to complete my mafia movie collection, and I am glad I did.
I especially like the guy playing the psycho brother (like Sonny in the Godfather). Almost all of his scenes are laugh-out-loud funny.",1020384000,,441,4.815789473684211
988945,4,6305209979,"I'll admit that I did not like this film the first time I saw it in the theatre. It started out at a snail's pace and seemed equally strained for laughter. However, there was a smattering of truly insightful comic genius throughout that made it mildly enjoyable. Then I watched it on video with a group of people. For some unknown reason I found myself laughing uncontrollably. As I watched the film again I then began to notice how much it followed the GODFATHER saga in parody. Once I began to realize what the filmmakers were doing it all started to take shape and made good comic sense. Not only did it follow the same inspirational format of AIRPLANE but it took the same approach with its audience: if this joke doesn't work for you we have plenty more lined up one after another and eventually you are going to start laughing. What's interesting is that you actually have to listen carefully to what is being said to really get the full effect of this well thought out comedy because it is much more than just a parody.",1014681600,21,1026,4.462765957446808

988947,4,6305209979,"i loved how this movie completely made a joke out of people's ignorance and stupidity, even if you haven't seen the movies it's spoofing, it is hilarious to watch them make fun of how dumb people can really be. props to the writers, and although a bunch of people think i'm an idiot for saying this, but this is more than just a stupid comedy to watch when ur tired, because if you think about it, there really is a message.",1010102400,,424,4.246913580246914
988948,5,6305209979,"This is the best spoof on any Mafia movie ever made. The slap-knee inside jokes on the Godfather Trilogy and Scarface. From the very beginning when Cortino (Mohr) walks out of his casino, and looks over at his car as it says : ""Please use the other car"" and he just shrugs it off and then goes over to that car, it spoofs not only Mafia movies, but your Forrest Gump, The English Patient, and Twister.
The Casino spoofs are so funny when Cortino is walking through the casino and it starts talking about the games. When the movie spoofs Godfather Part II in the flashback scenes - it's truly funny, as Don Cortino as a young boy, the scene as he races to the boat, which is nickname El Pacino, so he swims all the way to New York and he is easily out of breath.
To the part as Applegate's character is the President in the end, when she storms into his office, as he singing the apporiate checks i.e. bullet store, as Diane asks him if he killed all those people as he calmly replied ""No"" which is good enough for Mrs. President cause she replies ""Oh well, I'm going to get some ice cream. See you tonight?""
And Mama Cortino who takes care of her grandson's woman problems by blowing up the hotel in which she is staying at. And the Riverdance spoof cannot be missed.",1009324800,,1267,4.283333333333333
988949,3,6305209979,"This movie is so silly...I wanted it so badly cause I didn't get to see it at the movies. Then when I saw it ..I was not pleased..It's a mix of Casino, the Godfather, and Goodfellas..Some parts are funny but it was too stupid for me to watch a second time..",1001376000,,257,4.0588235294117645
988950,4,6305209979,"Excellent movie! however, the only reason why I give it 4 stars istead of 5 is because like any of Jim Abraham's other movies, the humor in them tend to get a little dry every once in a while.  Otherwise, this is an excellent movie! my favorite parody is the Riverdance one, I never thought a tap-dancing, 500 lbs white man would be so funny.  Congratulations Mr. Abrahams!",983750400,,373,4.470588235294118
988951,5,6305209979,"When I saw the previews for Mafia I couldn't believe how stupid it looked. When I finally got around to seeing it I realized how wrong I was. Mafia is a hilarious tongue in cheek spoof. If you take movies seriously, and hate raunchy humor don't see it. But if you have a sense of humor and love having fun and laughing, you can not miss this movie.",976924800,,348,4.132352941176471
988952,5,6305209979,This is without doubt a nonsense comedy and I guess I'm just that kind of person.  I think the critic up top was a bit unjust!  He said that comedy of this sort was somewhat creaky nowadays.  Well I say it depends on the person.  I did not find it the least bit Creaky so if you think like me then go rent it and you won't be dissappointed!,976752000,,340,3.8840579710144927
988953,5,6305209979,"This movie is one of the most funny movies I have ever seen. I really depends on what kind of sense of humor you have. It is especially funny for a kid, but has some stuff an adult would know about to get some jokes.
It  is a spoof on mob movies, and some others, like Forrest Gump. It doesn't  really need lots of explaining, just watch it for laughs!
You would  probably like this movie if you liked stuff like Naked Gun, or Hot Shots.",961632000,7,437,4.058139534883721

7885138,2,6305209979,I wanted to see this when it came out.  I remember it pretty much tanked when it came out.  Lloyd Bridges looks tired and looks like he has better things to do.  The one thing it has going for it is Christina Applegate.  Who has been in her share of flops.  But still always looks great.  She plays the President of the United States which is probably all you need to know about this.,1505001600,,384,4.121621621621622

If you have seen others like ""Airplane"" then this movie will not be as impressive as it could be. If this is your first foray in to the world of puns and parodies it holds its own.",1502236800,,355,3.810810810810811
