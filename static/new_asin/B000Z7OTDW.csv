8235006,5,B000Z7OTDW,"The vendors response was great and the product is what I hoped for.  I got to see Dick Butkus at his brutal best again. This set also included Vince Lombardi and the Packers being followed through the 1967 Season, Great Stuf. Many other good ones on others as well, really liked the one on Joe Capp and the Vikings.",1326067200,,315,4.338983050847458
8235007,3,B000Z7OTDW,"The Lost Archives Vol. 1 is better. There are some great pieces in this set, but some features that do not focus on the plays and players ON THE FIELD as much as I would like. I am a huge fan of NFL Films and I love the vintage films from the 70's - I would recommend this set - it s great time capsule of a much different time long before ESPN and all of the .coms, it's also a great price; but there should be more game action that provided.",1280188800,7,443,3.8260869565217392
8235008,5,B000Z7OTDW,"As has been stated by this reviewer before, if you're looking for a negative review, about anything produced by NFL Films, from me, you are going to be looking for a long time.  I am biased.

This 3-disc set is classic NFL footage.  There are highlights from the 60s&70s, spiked with episodes of the ""Lost Treasures"" series.  As opposed to Volumes 1-3 of this series, Volumes 4-6 do not feature ""commentary"" options, where you play a program and listen to Steve Sabol, of NFL Films, spin stories about what you are looking at.  You know, I kind of miss that.

Anyway ... this three-volume set includes the incredible ""Autumn Ritual"" video from the 1980s.  That alone makes the buy worthwhile.

8235009,3,B000Z7OTDW,"Don't let the 3 stars fool you. This DVD set is going to be a valuable part of my library.

The reason for the middling rating is that a few of the films on these DVDs didn't interest me because they didn't contain vintage NFL action, which is what I love about these releases.

One was about what some players from the late-1960s, early-1970s did in the off-season, and two were about a minor-league football team.

However, ""Eyeball to Eyeball,"" ""More Than a Game,"" ""Big Game America,"" ""The Old, the Bold, and the Young,"" and ""Lombardi"" are all going to be rewatched many times over the coming months and are highly recommended for old-school football fans.",1206403200,16,659,4.663793103448276
