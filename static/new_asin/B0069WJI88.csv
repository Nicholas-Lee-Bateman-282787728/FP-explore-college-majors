She makes sense of the ecological,the many global concerns, not to exclude personal upheavals we are witnessing, perhaps experiencing at this time. She talks with optimism, about growing our spiritual intelligence, the future of humanity, and normalizes symptoms of spiritual transformation in a very clear message by sharing personal examples,using colorful images and metaphors. We learn that we are living in a very exciting time in history as we are evolving and moving to higher dimensions since we are co-creators affecting ourselves, the collective, including Planet Earth should we chose this. We are called to awaken to our spiritual gifts and responsibilities and balance. I stongly recommend this delightful and informative DVD to anyone questioning while looking direction in today's world and for  Planet Earth. Thanks so much for your love and committment, Tanis!
