8379140,3,B002S913OI,"Gun Kyu, translated as War Pigeon in English, was an odd film to say the least.

The story centers around Kanako, a university professor.  During the film, summer vacation is about to start, but a strange death occurs on the universtiy campus. A young teen drowns head first in a cistren even though it was shallow enough for him to have escaped.  The police are baffled by the death and can find no answers for it.  Shortly after the semester ends, Kanako is busy working on biological reseach for her department.  Her work causes her to stay late at the university several nights.

During the night she begins to have strange expirences. She begins to encounter pigeons in the hallway near her lab.  In fact they attack her a couple of times, although she always awakens later after the attack and it appears she only imagined them.  She also finds large ammounts of pigeon droppings on her car winshield.

After going through a struggle over the incidents she discovers that the problem with the pigeons dates back to WW2. When they were being used as passenger pigeons. During that time several were killed and there seems to be a connection to the cistrin where the boy's death occured. An odd back story comes to light involving an elderly man and his role during WW2. There also seems to be a connection to Kanako's boyfriend who also gets pulled into the pigeons wrath.  I won't say anymore so as not to spoil the film for you.

Well this was definately a very different type of film.  Having a haunting centered around pigeons was strange to say they least.  But it is understandable since this film is Japanese. They have a very strong sense of enviormental justice that can be seen in many of their films and is often the cause of problems in the Godzilla movies.  It is also importnat to note that this film is actually a parallel storyline to another movie called Nu-Meri: Book of the New Spawn.  In that film one of Kanako's students is having problems with sealife that seem to be out for revenge. Kanako's research is actually tied to that film, although Gun Kyu does not get into that story very much.

As far as the scares, we do see some pretty graphic pigeon attacks. In fact we see one of an eye ball plucking.  Then it gets devoured by the pigeons.  There are a couple of tense moments where Kanako is alone and the pigeons attack her.  THe film also includes one steamy bedroom scene between Kanako and her boyfriend. Although it is obscured by a fish tank.  In reality the film did not need the scene. It seemed like an excuse to have a bedroom scene.

As far as the tech aspects, the film is in Japanese with English subtitles only. There is no English dub.

Overall I gave the film a three. The story seemed like a fresh idea. The same can be said about the sister film Nu-Meri.  I would say it is more of a sci fi film than a horror film. Something that you might expect to see on the sci fi channel.  The acting was fine, although I think the story could have been flushed out a little better. Not so much with Kanako, but her boyfriend.  So in the end I would say this film would appeal to people who like unusal Japanese SCi FI/Horror movies. It's not really J-Horror.  If you plan to buy or see this film, Nu-Meri was better in my opioion. Although it is not necessary to see both in order to understand the other.  But both definatly have a ""be careful of how you treat nature"" moral.",1276128000,,3416,4.424
