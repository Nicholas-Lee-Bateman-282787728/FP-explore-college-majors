8593563,2,B00DIJCIT6,"Was looking for Bagua Circle Walking Practice DVD  & since this is George Xu, I thought it would be great but not so.  The first problem is although Mr. Xu speaks in English; the audience is Italian & the translator drowns out Mr. Xu's voice.  There is basically no circle walking; some self defense moves demonstrated, I am really disappointed.",1387324800,,345,4.716666666666667
