7793593,4,0949906387,This DVD is by Dr. John Hartnett who argues rather persuasively that quasars are not (as popularly believed) massive objects at the universe's edge but embryonic galaxies ejected from mature galaxies in our own neighborhood. Dr. Hartnett is a professor from a leading university in Australian. His field is in physics and cosmology. It is a very interesting subject with a great deal of evidence. It truly is worth a watch.,1430956800,,423,4.971830985915493

7793596,5,0949906387,"Dr Hartnett explains how astronomers determine distances to far away galaxies. I came away from the video understanding that the redshift of distant galaxies is due to the doppler effect, or it's due to the cosmological expansion of space, or it's due to something else. Hartnett explains the difference between the doppler and cosmological redshifts..

The doppler redshift is the result of galaxies moving away from us at various velocities as a result of being propelled by the Big Bang explosion, which astronomers shun because it means there is a unique center to the universe, and we are very near that center.

The cosmological redshift also represents galaxies moving away from us. Astronomers prefer a cosmological redshift that can be likened to inflating a balloon painted with dots. The dots, which represent galaxies, don't expand but only the material of the balloon, which represents the expansion of space. This is a typical representation of an expanding universe. The balloon analogy breaks down because the dots don't expand.

Some exceptions to redshifted galaxies are blueshifted galaxies, such as our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda, which is moving towards us at 100km/sec. Nothing to worry about, folks, because Andromeda is about 2 million light years away from us. Maybe it will take billions of years before Andromeda crashes into us. You can have fun with your mathematically-minded kids by having them calculate how long it would take for this to happen. A light year is 9,460,730,472,580,800 meters. They'll have to convert meters to kilometers, or convert 100 kilometers/sec to meters/sec before they can figure out how many seconds it will take Andromeda to go one light year. Once they figure that out, then all that remains is to multiply the time to go one light year by 2 million. At some point, they should convert seconds to years. Just knowing how many seconds there are in a year will help pare down the size of the final answer. Very big numbers can get confusing.

After Hartnett explained how astronomers figure out the distances to far away galaxies, and that the redshift is due to the expansion, he began explaining the work of Halton Arp, who studied thousands of ""peculiar"" galaxies all over the universe, which call into question the standard interpretation of the redshift and the Big Bang as well. A fairly significant group of notable astronomers and physicists argue that the Big Bang theory is based on some flawed interpretations of the redshifts and that there never was a Big Bang, such as Sir James Jeans, Sir Fred Hoyle, Margaret and Geoffrey Burbidge, and other distinguished scientists.

I studied some of Arp's material and even got a letter answered by him when I was trying to understand what the redshift was due to if it wasn't because galaxies were moving away from us. I think my question was whether the redshift was due to ""tired"" light resulting from entropy or something else like gravitational force pulling on the photons and stretching the wavelength (which gravity is known to do). He didn't like the ""tired"" light idea. Maybe I'll locate his letter some day, I hope.

Arp and another astronomer, the late John Bahcall, debated about the redshift. The debate was published in Redshift Controversy edited by George Field. It is being sold by some of Amazon's partners. Arp has several catalogs of peculiar galaxies showing bridges of matter connecting a pair of galaxies with greatly differing redshifts, e.g., one of the pair moving 17,000 kilometers/sec while the other was moving at half the speed of light, as Hartnett explained.

Dr Hartnett talked about one standard explanation for the origin of quasars as being ejected from the massive black holes at the centers of galaxies, an idea with which he disagrees. He thinks quasars are some kind of white hole that pumped out galaxies, which is the opposite of the standard explanation.

However, Hartnett continued discussing Arp's findings of galaxy-galaxy or galaxy-quasar pairs, all of which appear to be linked by bridges of trailing stars and nebular debris. Arp has catalogued thousands of such ""peculiar"" pairs. One especially good example of the relationship between quasars and the galaxies from which they were supposedly ejected is that of the spiral galaxy NGC 4319 and quasar Markarian 205. The connecting bridge is very clear. Is the quasar a billion light years away from the galaxy or is something wrong with redshift theory? Perhaps there is no expansion, at least not due to a big bang which never happened Eric Lerner's The Big Bank Never Happened, which is available on Amazon. Hartnett used a different galaxy-quasar example, but the point is that if these connecting bridges are real, the two objects couldn't be separated by such great distances. There has to be something wrong with the interpretation of the redshift. Even Edwin Hubble, who practically invented the Big Bang, thought there might be another interpretation possible due to some secondary effect.

Then Hartnett surprised me with something I didn't know, which makes the video worthwhile to even the more seasoned amateurs like me. Oftentimes these peculiar galaxies have twin quasars connected to them. The galaxy has the much slower redshift, while the two quasars on opposite sides of the galaxy have much greater and nearly identical redshifts. Now that is truly interesting. Quasars are not stars, they are not galaxies, and they are incredibly bright, outshining galaxies even though they are supposedly many times farther away than their associated galaxies, with an energy output a thousand times that of our galaxy. Maybe they really are white holes and they are making galaxies. I'm sure you know Big Bang theorists would never agree with this.

Whatever the actual nature of quasars and their associated galaxies really represent, the redshift interpretation offered by Big Bang theorists is questionable, and astronomers might do well to start thinking outside the box.",1363305600,8,5998,5.1112244897959185
