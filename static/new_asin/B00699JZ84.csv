8495197,4,B00699JZ84,"David Taylor explains in great detail how he quilts his pictorial quilts.  He has good concise information, but his technique of rows of stitching that are 1/8"" apart may be a bit to much for most quilters.  All in all a good training DVD that shows the importance of precise quality craftsmanship.",1350604800,10,298,4.711538461538462
8495198,1,B00699JZ84,"This video was very disappointing!  I expected to learn something, but most of what he said was practice, practice practice.  He spent a lot of wasted time, not teaching.  Would not buy another of his videos.",1326672000,14,208,4.722222222222222
