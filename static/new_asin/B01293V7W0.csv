7344676,3,B01293V7W0,"For the life of me, I can't name at least a dozen Cannon films (Golan/Globus years) I ever liked. I don't think I can even name at least six. Oh well, here is my list of Cannon Films I ever liked. In no particular order, Barfly, Runaway Train, 10 to Midnight, and yes, even Masters of the Universe. Okay, that's four. Hopefully by the end of this review I might come up with a total of five titles.
I waited for Electric Boogaloo: The Untold Story of Cannon films with baited breath. I especially liked the fact the makers of Not Quite Hollywood, and Machete Maidens Unleashed  were responsible for this documentary. I loved those two documentaries. I finally got my copy of Electric Boogaloo: The Untold Story of Cannon Films in the mail. I sat and watched the title, and was I impressed? Did I have fun remembering  the long gone days of the eighties? Uh, No! There wasn't anything interesting about the documentary that was worth putting on film. I already knew about the excesses of the megalomaniacs  Menacham Golan and Yoram Globus, and how they would (un)intentionally destroy a film. To watch a group of actors, writers, and directors trash the Cannon Films may have seemed like entertainment, but it became boring after awhile, My fave was Martine Beswicke trying to convince anybody she didn't know what she was signing onto when she made Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood. I nearly busted a gut laughing when the Cannon cousins thought Michael Dudikoff had screen presence. A stick of wood has more screen presence than Mr. Dudikoff.
What I remembered most of the Cannon films is, during the eighties, they would release two-three sometimes five movies a the same time, and almost everyone of them bombed. You would have thought after a few megaton bombs, they would have learned.
If anything, this documentary might be considered a cautionary tale for new film distributors that quantity does not mean quality. Oh wait a minute! I came up with a fifth title from the Cannon Library I liked- The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. There! Now I got five titles.",1450483200,,2057,4.740223463687151
7344677,3,B01293V7W0,"I have loved there other documentaries but this one was not as interesting.  Although the filming and editing were great, the subject material was not as good as I had hoped. I just found myself getting bored in parts of it.",1450396800,,224,4.463414634146342
7344678,4,B01293V7W0,"I had seen some number of Cannon films but never really thought about who they were. I remember the Golan/Globus names popping up in the opening credits but, again, they were only names to me. This documentary filled in a lot of blanks.

Here's the scoop. This film lets the viewer meet Golan and Globas, two Israeli film makers from their start up in Israel to their invasion of Hollywood where they try to out Hollywood Hollywood. The rise and fall of two Schlock-meisters.

What an eye opener this was. These guys made a million movies, most with titles I'd heard of but didn't see. Lots of industry folk (writers, editors, directors, et al) are on hand to flesh out the story of this incredible Keystone Cop kind of film makers. They tell how the likes of Chuck Norris, Jean Claude Van Damme, Michael Dudikoff and others actually became moderate to iconic stars working in films that started shooting before scripts were even written. It seems the two Israeli buddies had a knack for selling films to producers using little more than the film's poster. Once they had the money the rushed into production with little or no time and just shot from the hip. But it worked over and over again.

They then ventured into trying to make better respected films. Films that would legitimize them with the Hollywood elite. They did produce Zeffirelli's ""Otello"" which, it seems, was well received. They also Produced Lifeforce"" which has become a cult favorite. But, alas, all good things must pass and so did their tin can kingdom.

There is a lot of input from a lot of people who, as this is edited, seem to be in agreement on how the two buddies were perceived and how they managed to do the seemingly impossible.

If you are of the age where Cannon films were part of your entertainment diet, this is a must see.",1450310400,3,1811,4.594427244582043
7344679,5,B01293V7W0,"Australian produced documentary film (by the kinetic director Mark Hartley) about the wild and (until now) untold story of the Cannon Group gets my vote for the best documentary of the year--and maybe for one of the best documentaries about film for all time. The tale of the 'go go' boys (Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan) is emphasized over other contributors to the Cannon legacy, but there are still many important comments given by other screenwriters, producers, and actors who were affiliated with films financed and distributed by this company. The work ethic of Menahem and Yoram (referred to by one of the actresses interviewed as ""Mayhem and Urine"") was absolutely incredible really, and should serve as a much needed shot-in-the-arm to the bone lazy, sluggish habits of today's ""filmmakers,"" such as Quentin Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson, and (especially) Christopher Nolan. (At least Menahem showed what a creative filmmaker is really supposed to be like!)
Moving like lightning and yet containing more interviews and more information than you could want out of five full-length documentaries, ""Electric Boogaloo"" is more like a business education film than a history of the cinema, but no matter what label you want to slap on it, it is nonetheless the most essential film I have ever seen about the business of moviemaking and wheeling and dealing to get films made. While Golan and Globus were working out a lot of their methods in the early days, this film is quite educational if you are interested in figuring out how to fund your own movie, or if you have designs of your own about entering the business. While a majority of the comments are offered by ignorant and abrasive snobs (I'm looking at you, Frank Yablans!), whose own prejudiced anti-Semitism they can barely contain while discussing Cannon's history, it is the proud and prolific team of Golan/Globus who will enjoy the last laugh in the end. Yablans says ""where's the quality?"" I could tell him but he wouldn't understand--in fact, only true movie lovers will. I can watch ""The Delta Force,"" ""Over the Top,"" ""Bloodsport,"" and ""Enter the Ninja"" over and over again, but once you've seen ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Titanic"" once, there is NEVER any reason to watch them again. Golan/Globus understood well the rise of commercial TV and cable stations, and they played to the strengths of these smaller markets like nobody's business. While the picture contains sarcastic and sometimes quite vicious assessments of the Cannon Group's business practices, the negativity offered by some of these talking heads actually works towards the favor of the Cannon Group's future longevity in terms of rediscovery. I love the bit about ""The Delta Force"", one of my favorite action movies--the talking heads want ""political correctness,"" but with the rise of Isis and other terror cells in our current day, I find it difficult that any sane person will deem the killing of the enemy as ""politically incorrect."" I love the power of these old Cannon movies because they illustrate a vision of America as it should be, and one that is sadly slipping away from us day by day. I wish more films like ""The Delta Force"" were being produced today, but when your country becomes too cowardly to speak out against evil we end up with movies like ""The Hangover"" and ""Despicable Me"" instead. And Hollywood thinks this is acceptable? Besides, I would much rather watch Pyun's problematic adaptation of Captain America than I would any of these other obscenely expensive revisions that Hollywood has been choking us with lately. Maybe Golan/Globus were more interested in the business of pushing film titles than they were in the creative perfection of the actual movie producing part (in itself), but let's be honest here--the two made interesting films! And, the movies are so much more entertaining than these pretentious films of today that are supposed to be ""better"" technically and story wise.
I actually purchased this disc as part of the 10-movie pack that also includes new transfers of ""Missing in Action,"" ""Bloodsport,"" ""Cobra,"" and others, One point of contention I have about the 10-pack set is that Pyun's ""Cyborg"" was not included in a new, uncut, pristine transfer that would restore poetic justice to this maligned and critically damned sf/futuristic action classic. If you watch closely during the documentary, you witness some of the ""raw"" imagery that was included in the widescreen foreign cuts of the film. Tragically, this footage was never restored for the newer MGM label copy that has been floating around stores more currently. Also, the German cut (entitled ""Slinger"") as released on Blu-Ray is also missing this ""obscene"" footage, and it is unfortunately only offered as a rough cut on the disc. But this cleaned up, uncut version exists somewhere because we now have fragments of it on this documentary! Wouldn't you think that with this renewed interest in the Cannon legacy that someone would stick up money for the rights and release a special edition of that film for the American market?! Even though it is a special interest/""cult"" movie, I mean c'mon! It's a Van Damme classic for Pete's sake. But other than that, this disc alone (and the 10-pack too--even though it includes a lot of films you probably already have on DVD, the new transfers are cleaner and with better picture/sound overall) gets an easy A+ from me. Enjoy!",1450224000,3,5433,5.017718715393134

7344681,5,B01293V7W0,"I grew up in the 80's.  I remember my father renting just about every film this company made, and loving them.  This is a fantastic documentary about how Canon Films came about, all the craziness that happened, and all the tragically awesome movies that came from this company.

If you dug Missing in Action on VHS or Beta in the 80's, you'll dig this history of the film company that made it, and alllll the other flicks.

7344683,5,B01293V7W0,"I love cheap independent film of this era, and even more, I love behind-the-scenes stories about what it took to get these things produced. Plus I love documentaries. So this obviously is right in my wheelhouse. It might not be in yours.

It is lengthy--upwards of two hours and probably more than three counting the extras, which are abundant. But I couldn't get enough of the stories about the crazy Cannon Films collaborators, Israeli cousins who grew up loving American films (although not entirely understanding the American audience). Hilarious, fun stuff.

Big bonus: Lots and lots and lots of female nudity from many of these movies, which accounts for the R rating.",1448150400,8,674,5.008928571428571

7344685,5,B01293V7W0,"Where do I begin? So much in this doc to talk about. I'm always interested in learning about movies from childhood that on the surface should have been hits but turned into bombs. What happened and who was behind it? It was the legendary Cannon Films. They had the stars and the big ideas but somewhere in the middle it became a trainwreck. The doc runs through a humongous catalog of Cannon films, talking to all involved as they speak the honest truth about the company and movies they were a part of. I stretch HONEST. A lot of it sadly but laughably mocks Golan. Cannon made the Death Wish movies, Superman 4, He-Man, Chuck Norris movies, etc... just to give you a taste. I think if Cannon had not done so many films a year, perhaps focusing on a few solid films without rushing, they may still be around. These guys were pioneers though and went for their dreams, gotta love the passion. If your a fan of the film biz you'll love this. I could've watched four more hours of it.",1447632000,4,982,4.371584699453552
7344686,4,B01293V7W0,"A good documentary tracing the ""glorious ?"" history of Cannon films from it's pre Golan/Globus era thru the entire run of success and failures of the 2 Israel born cousins. Menachem Golan and his cousin Yorum Globus moved to Hollywood from Israel to pursue their dreams of making movies and money. Golan had done cinema work back in Israel and Globus had a business background so it was a worthy gambit. Golam loved movies but was not so good at directing them even though he sure tried. Taking over the fledling Cannon films (Happy Hooker series etc) the cousins set out to create memorable films at a rapid pace with small budgets. Think Roger Corman and New World Pictures and you'd see the floor plan they followed. But where the Cannon boys went wrong were they were lousy at making films that connected to a large American audience,It may have been because they were not Americans as theorized in the film ? They also over extended themselves constantly money wise, often made a film based off a title or poster art and later on over paid for past there prime actors or franchises on their last legs. The film done without either Golan or Globus participating does have a slew of good interviews with a huge collection of those connected to Cannon at one point or another. Directors like Just Jaclin (Lady Chatteryly's Lover ),Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw 2),Michael Winner (Death Wish 2) and Rusty Lemonade(!) offer their thoughts .Former stars of Cannon films like Sybil Danning,Bo Derek,Cartherine Mary Stewart,Lucinda Dickey,Diane Franklin,Alex Winter,Marina Sirtis  and Michael Dudikoff are interviewed as well. Producer Irvin Yablans also offers his VERY negative viewpoint of working with Cannon films when he was in charge of MGM and distributed many of their films along the way. I love behind the scenes documentaries and this one is a good one. It offers a fair and balanced approach neither guy is vilified or glorified just presented as flawed humans like all of us. Cannon left its mark on Hollywood for sure for example they gave Charles Bronson a late in life career revival, made Chuck Norris a bankable star,and while few Cannon films are Oscar worthy(try NONE) a vast majority are at least entertaining .So if you like insider films and want to hera whjat those involved in various ways be sure to check this film out.",1460160000,6,2342,4.855
7344687,1,B01293V7W0,"My wife picked this up for me as an anniversary gift knowing I had grown up enjoying many films in the Canon catalogue growing up. In fact; I still enjoy many of their films.

I couldn't even get halfway through. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. This ""documentary"" is comprised of interviews with many no-talent shmucks whom couldn't get a decent job after the demise of Canon. They insult the dead whom gave them years of employment.

Knocking female nudity in R rated films? Violence in exploitation movies? Consistently complaining they were ""cheap""? Isn't this the reason we watched many of these movies growing up?

Does anyone out there really believe that upping the budget for more outlandish catering; or an extra 7 days shooting per project really would have made these particular films better? Hearing them complain of lighting a girl while laying nude in a cold location just made me smack my forehead. She was relatively dark-skinned; difficult to light - and that's part of the job. Sometimes acting calls for you to lay there and be a bit cold. Some extras can lay in latex for 8 hours. On some sets; people have to swim in near-freezing temperatures. It's been 30 years. Just enjoy the fact you were part of something that enough people embraced - that a documentary was even made.

I guess what irked me was that there's a right and wrong way to go about discussing the dead... especially when these folks could have left their employment anytime. To take money for over a decade; consistently return to work - and NOW complain... seems a bit much.

This really could have been a lot of fun. These movies inspired a generation of teens to want to make fun movies - and exploitation filmmakers have been borrowing elements for years. Personally; I still find ""The Last American Virgin"" to be the pinnacle of teen comedies.

It would seem many whom were under contract with Canon (sadly) turned out to be a lot of easily ""offended"" entitlement babies with no individual skills outside of an assembled team - complaining where the accused could not defend themselves. Let's look at these fantastic filmmakers resumes AFTER the fact (Boaz Davidson for starters) - they sure were being held back (sarcasm)!

I'll take some attractive women; explosions and bad guys I can root against over the typical PC male-nudity riddled ""comedies"" and ""the bad guy is only bad because of his childhood"" movies we get today. Not to mention the current overspending and pandering to this current crop of Hollywood brats and the entitled.

I'm pretty sure watching this; and seeing the personalities of many interviewed that it's clear they didn't like the conservative nature of the content (not to mention - some seemed pretty anti-Semitic toward Israel) - so, like most people with an agenda - they knock those whom are no longer around to defend themselves - and give their side of the stories (were there profit margin issues; what was the return on investment; deadlines from pre-sales - etc. - heck - how did Golan and Globus raise the money to buy Canon - NONE of these are questions are asked - forget answered - this ""documentary"" is a one way street)

""Best Worst Movie"" covers their subjects with much less bias and so does ""Popatopolis"". Both are all the better for it.",1459641600,3,3288,4.764499121265378

8725721,5,B01293V7W0,"In ""Electric Boogaloo"" director Mark Hartley, who loves movies, chronicles Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan, two immigrants who also loved movies, even ridiculous films with tiny budgets. I have seen a lot of the Golan-Globus and Cannon Films catalog, and never failed to enjoy these films, often in spite of their production values instead of them (""Alien From L.A."" anyone?) Cannon Films had a storied history that started small, exploded in quick order, overextended itself and came crashing back down to earth, closing its doors in 1994. But for a while in the 1980s Cannon reigned supreme and ended up making some extremely memorable films in several genres, most often involving derivative action plots, but occasionally venturing spectacularly out of the mold, perhaps most notoriously with ""The Apple"", an absurdist musical that Menahem directed and was completely convinced would be a huge hit. It was not, but boy is it memorable.

Golan and Globus started stepping up their game by heavily popularizing ninja movies, some of which were better than others (""Ninja 3: The Domination"" is unbelievably kooky, and decades ahead of its time starred a female ninja), and signing bigger actors to roles starting with Charles Bronson in ""Death Wish 2"". They also (unfortunately) helped start and popularize rap with movies like ""Breakin"", ""Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo"", and ""Rappin'"", which is a sort of sequel to ""Breakin' 2"". The first two films are heavily discussed in this documentary and some of the interviews are among the most amusing on display here. I am particularly thankful for the interviews with Michael Chambers (""Boogaloo Shrimp"", who was truly amazing), and Adolfo Quinones (""Shabba-Doo""), which perfectly encapsulate the era.

Other interviews are also great for different reasons: Bo Derek (who is still beautiful) discusses ""Bolero"", and Richard Kraft in particular is a hilarious commentator with a lot to say. After Bronson, Cannon went on to cast Chuck Norris and ultimately Sylvester Stallone, who they paid $12 million for ""Over The Top"", and action movie about an arm wrestling truck driver. These investments began to sour as their production costs skyrocketed (e.g. ""Superman 4"" which was an awful film with horrendous special effects and which ultimately bombed). Cannon's finances spiraled out of control: the SEC investigated them and Michael Milken the felon junk bond king raised $300 million for them among other signs that their empire was crumbling.

The stress became too much to bear and the Menahem and Yoram dissolved their partnership and started making movies competing with each other, starting with two atrocious Lambada movies (one of which was dedicated to the preservation of the rainforests!) The independent B-movie industry was forever changed by Cannon and their legacy lives on in production decisions even today. As one commentator noted: ""It's schlock, but they sure do make a lot of it"". Indeed they did, and it's glorious, just like this documentary.",1473379200,3,3010,5.279749478079332
