8047948,4,B0007L7ZKA,"The two Sandy Olivieri produced documentaries on this GOODTIMES DVD double feature are more redundant than complementary.

ELVIS KING OF ENTERTAINMENT is better of the two. A sharper, brighter picture, a narrator and 100 minute running time. The faintest possible GT watermark in the lower right corner is only discernible when that area of the picture is dark. There's only two complete performances, both from  kinescopes: ""Heartbreak Hotel"" from  the Texaco Star Theater (4/3/56) and a 10/28/56 Ed Sullivan Show where Elvis sings ""Love Me"" with the Jordanaires.

All else is fragmentary:

Also shown are wedding movies and misc. news coverage including his Aug.'77 death, viewing, funeral.

RARE MOMENTS WITH THE KING is a dark, multi-generational transfer that runs 56 minutes, with intertitles instead of narration. The GT logo is boldly visible at all times. No film trailers here. Color footage is badly faded. Berle show kinescope includes Debra Paget and part of a record store skit. Steve Allen Rodeo Roundup sketch is complete. Extended 1961 post-Army news conference is audio-only over a montage of photos and film clips. 1970, '72 and '73 press conferences close the program; the '72 event is several minutes in length.",1397779200,,3694,8.707894736842105
8047949,5,B0007L7ZKA,Gave me a whole new love of the mystic of Elvis. His singing and music if beyond description but the look and actions of this man are beyond description.,1391472000,,153,4.310344827586207
8047950,5,B0007L7ZKA,I enjoyed watching this DVD.It is fun watching it with family and friends. A dvd that we can watch over and over,1369094400,,112,4.136363636363637
8047951,3,B0007L7ZKA,"(2 *'s) 'Elvis: Rare moments with the King,' is published by the same company that released 'Elvis: King of Entertainment'. It is shorter and repeats the highlights of the latter. With almost no musical samples, '...Rare Moments...' is almost more an archive of Elvis's sociological importance. It is interesting to see him interviewed on guest TV performances, but '...King of Entertainment...' has all of the best moments presented here plus some snippets of musical and film performances.

(3 1/2 *'s) 'Elvis: King of Entertainment' is more of a documentary than it is a compilation of performances. An overview of the highlights of his life, his career, his performances, and his movies, it makes a fine sampler. Interspersed with television performances and interviews, it is a testament to the phenomena that Elvis is and was. The only drawback is that the brief touches of each highlight will only be teasing and never really satisfying. Seeing footage of his army induction, his wedding, and early as well as Las Vegas performances are an interesting draw.",1176681600,,1064,5.1502890173410405
8047952,4,B0007L7ZKA,"It is called a ""2 pack"" but I had only 1 DVD recorded on both sides. This DVD has a lot of the great old B&W as well as color footage. Elvis from birth, then as a kid, in high school & with mom & dad. Then the usual early footage (or pieces of) from The Tommy Dorsey ""stage show"", the Tupelo concert with Elvis in black, the AWFUL Steve Allen show ""tumbleweed"" skit, Ed Sullivan, Milton Berle (on stage & on a ship), Hy Gardner calling, the ""gas station fight"" court room scene and the Frank Sinatra show; the things that most true Elvis fans have all seen repeatedly.  There is, of course, the Army footage, the wedding shots, the 68 special, Aloha from Hawaii, many shots of Graceland, assorted 70's footage (from Elvis on tour, Las Vegas & the 3 press interviews) and even some clips from his movies (but not all of them). And it ends with many scenes from his final days and the aftermath. Although this DVD is really very well done, my only complaint is that 90% of the material on side 1, IS ON SIDE 2! And I do mean 90%! I only paid $5 for this so I am not mad but Goodtimes should know better than to try this. As with all Elvis documentaries, this one doesn't show the good stuff much longer than a few seconds. I'd really like to see the ""Youth Benefit Concert"", (where Elvis is really Elvis! [arm swinging & pelvis pumping], played in it's entirety with the right sound track. We always see the same 15 second clip with some other song dubbed in and that's it. Anyone know where I can find it? My advice here is to enjoy this one, but don't pay too much for it, only one side is really needed.",1107734400,3,1604,4.190938511326861
