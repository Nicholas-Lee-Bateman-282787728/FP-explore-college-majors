8174631,5,B000N3SS3K,"If you check out the reviews for the two DVDs that are included in this set, which you can also buy individually, you will find almost universal praise for Ken Baldwin's teaching.  It is really that good.  Normally I would say buy this set, which I purchased a few years ago when the price was reasonable.  But what I see as I write this are crazy prices from Amazon affiliated vendors ranging from $155 to almost $500.  That usually means the title is out of print.  Too bad.  But you can still buy the individual DVDs for reasonable prices.  Just search Amazon for ""Hot Salsa Lessons"" and you will find them.",1404432000,,610,4.441441441441442
