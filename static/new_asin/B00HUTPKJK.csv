6225150,2,B00HUTPKJK,"It was inevitable that producers, writers, directors would bring soldiers back to fight some more. Been done before so nothing new. A little strange in this case was the frequent honorifics doled out to these former soldiers, i.e. ""We are honored by your service, and by the way that you are a vigilante serving justice while circumventing the laws."" A bit of a slippery slope there if they think about it. Anyway, usual tough guy looks, talk and mixed martial arts (MMA) kicks/punches dominate the movie. So if you're into that fantasy this was no worse or better than all the others doing this routine for the past couple decades.",1395532800,,632,4.754545454545455

6225152,3,B00HUTPKJK,"""Little did I know life makes no sense whatsoever and I was about to learn it the hard way."" John (Le) has just returned home from Iraq and is having a hard time adjusting to civilian life. While staying in a seedy motel he hears a woman scream. When he goes out to help her things go a little too far and a few of the gang members that were attacking the woman end up dead. Hollis (Lundgren) the gang leader isn't happy with what occurred and John finds himself in the middle of another war he doesn't want. Since I watch so many movies I have seen my fair share of Dolph Lundgren stuff in my life. When you see a movie that he stars in you pretty much know what to expect. This is one really no different. In this one he plays a bad guy. Cung Le is actually not bad in this and the story is decent but I don't know what it is with Lundgren movies, they are all very generic and predictable. This is another movie where a man is forced into a war with an overly evil gang leader. The leader has one always faithful sidekick as well as the member who isn't sure if he agrees with what is going on. If you see enough of these movies you can guess what happens from there. Overall, not really as bad as I was expecting but still another generic Lundgren movie. I give this a C+.",1394236800,2,1276,4.047430830039525

6225165,4,B00HUTPKJK,"Looking for an action movie that Rambo would be proud of?  Puncture Wounds is it.  The violence is realistically beautiful, nice and gritty.  Lots of stabbing, kicking, mma moves, chokes, and a couple shotgun shells put to interesting uses.

The story follows a PTSD-haunted soldier who gets wrapped up in a nightmare by doing the right the thing.  The plot builds logically, has quite a few characters worth following, and the acting is pretty damn good for a low-budget action movie.  Yes, there are the henchmen who cannot say one line without sounding phony, but they die quickly.

Cung Le is awesome.  He takes it to the scumbags with style.  If you thought he was a bad man in the octagon, wait till you see him set loose!  Dolph Lundgren plays a scary giant hippie villain.  It works.  How?  I'm still not sure.

As for flaws, yeah.  There are some.

The beginning has a few flashback scenes that don't make sense until you see the END of the movie.

The soundtrack turns ancient Chinese every once in a while when Cung is fighting.  Which felt a bit racist, to be honest.  Otherwise it is laced with heavy metal.

And, of course, some of the budget limits shine through.  A fight scene shot in a claustrophobic living room.  A shoot out in an estate's parking area that uses a tiny portion of the parking area.  A scene where some guys pretend to break in a door, but because the door is obviously expensive and quite attractive they leave it unlocked and try to make it look like they slammed it open.  LOL.

Whatever.  The bulk of the movie is fun.  You definitely want to see what will happen next.  Cung Le's action and acting are worth the price of admission.  I hope he makes more films.

Worth renting.",1407196800,,1717,4.498371335504886

6225170,3,B00HUTPKJK,"There are a few pretensions here to thinking mans action/artisitic movies like the Limey that never reach that level, but making the effort alone deserves a bit of appreciation. More importantly, for a low=budget B movie there is some decent acting at play.
Lundgren manages a decent turn at being the bad guy without going into the scenery chewing excess you might expect. Gianni Capaldi, as in ""Ambushed"",manages to add a bit of depth to a minor second banana roll. Cung Le's stock stoic hero role is pulled off as well as it could be.",1403222400,,537,4.663157894736842
6225171,1,B00HUTPKJK,"This is the worst movie in the history of film. The fight scenes suck, the story is tired and old ; then there's Mr. Lundgrens wig. How in the hell after hundreds of movies can Dolph do this. Cung Le sucks in the UFC and in front of the camera.",1401926400,,244,3.9
6225172,3,B00HUTPKJK,"In between playing supporting roles in movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grandmaster/dp/B00ET2ODYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grandmaster</a>, Cung Le found the time to build on his solo career in the direct-to-video realm. Disappointingly, his sophomore effort here leaves a good deal to be desired. While the previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Eyes/dp/B0099KJFJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Eyes</a>&nbsp;filled his prospects as a karate star with promise, ""Puncture Wounds"" is a less impressive action flick that's mainly weakened by the ravages of producers and certainly leaves Le looking less extraordinary. It's still a decent film that's strengthened by its fight content, but a bit too far from perfect to warrant a purchase for me.

The story: The family of a war veteran (Le) is murdered by a racist underground faction after he interferes with their business, prompting him to target the group and its leader (Dolph Lundgren) for retribution.

I don't blame the stars or even the director (Giorgio Serafini,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Death/dp/B004F7BGBG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Death</a>) for the movie's ""DTV-isms."" The production company behind the film, Voltage Pictures, has a habit of editing its low budget movies in amateurish ways, so expect to see lots of gratuitous slow motion and sped-up segments, ""artistic"" lighting overexposures, unnecessary close-ups, and scene-hopping.  These aspects are present just enough to properly irritate you but not ruin the movie, to the same degree that the screenplay bothers me. There's a good deal of unnecessary cruelty and exploitation of women that I don't appreciate, and I find it hard to forgive how boring the script renders Dolph Lundgren. The Swedish Superman excels at playing villains,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/even-in-DTV-movies/dp/B0085Z3ABI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">even in DTV movies</a>, and though it seems like the part of the long-haired supremacist leader would let him show off some of his creepiness, he clearly doesn't have good character material to work with and ends up being pretty unmemorable.

Cung Le shows his rather meager dramatic limits, though he still makes a good tough guy. Another tough guy, Vinnie Jones (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-The-Last-Stand/dp/B000HCO83Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men: The Last Stand</a>), plays a character that weirdly has the bare minimum to do with the plot but manages through sheer charisma to still come off cool. But actions speak louder than words in these kinds of movies, and this is where ""Puncture Wounds"" shows its best side. With only four fight scenes and one shootout, the movie could definitely use more action, though Cung Le's kicks are worth waiting for. The choreography manages to appear completely efficient without shirking flashiness, so it's very satisfying when Le takes on groups of bad guys. His finale with Lundgren is much shorter than it should be, but it allows Lundgren to look pretty fluid and powerful, using his height, reach, and power karate to take the fight to Le, cool but believably.

The fights too are hampered by the aforementioned editing, so despite being the movie's brightest spot, they can't elevate this review to a higher rating. Despite this one being a minor disappointment, I'm hopeful for Le's future, provided he choose a better studio for his next vehicle. I hope Lundgren used this flick as a warm-up to his impending films with Tony Jaa, but that's another matter. Bottom line: if you're looking for an imperfect but moderately exciting karate-revenge movie, this one fits the bill well enough, but it's not nearly the best any of its performers have to offer.",1401235200,4,3940,6.117540687160941
