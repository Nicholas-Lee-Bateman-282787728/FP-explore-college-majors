8077454,5,B000AAUMB2,"I saw this TV Series when it came out originally through Spanish International TV.
My brother and I had been searching for it for ages and finally found it.
It is still awesome!",1264550400,2,177,4.393939393939394
8077455,4,B000AAUMB2,"This is a superbly scripted and acted tv miniseries. It has the feel of a movie, with high production values. The main character, former bull fighter Juncal, is an inveterate bs artist and philanderer. But he has some integrity. The shows have delightful humor and occasional social satire. The scenery in Valencia and Cordoba is first rate, both interior and exterior.",1245974400,2,369,5.065573770491803
