7835482,4,630303232X,Not enough Bill Champlin but still a great concert would love a DVD version though. I assume that new song 'The Pull' is from that album the record company didn't like and wouldn't release. I wonder why Chicago don't release it now cause that song and the others that are on the boxed set are really good. Anyway this is a ripper add it your collection of this great band in concert,1104969600,2,382,4.319444444444445
7835483,5,630303232X,"This video, documenting a Chicago performance at Los Angeles' Greek Theater in 1993, is excellent from both a performance standpoint as well as a production value perspective. Originally filmed for PBS, the sound quality and camerawork are really first rate.  Thus, this VHS release cries out for re-issue on DVD.  Fortunately, I have a copy on laserdisc (remember these?) which is better than tape, but a viewing on DVD would be ideal.
Despite some reviewers below who feel the need to belittle the current incarnation of Chicago (or, this video's version which features excellent hard rock guitarist Dawayne Bailey instead of Chicago's present excellent  guitarist Keith Howland),  this video is well worth purchasing by true Chicago fans as well as anyone interested in this great band.
Chicago's amazing catalogue of hits is presented in fine fashion with the selection of songs being right on target to cover almost three decades of material.  True, the once avante-garde group's adventurous musical excursions are left out of this performance, but the tunes covered here are great nonetheless.
From the concert's opener ""Make Me Smile"", Chicago shows great energy and professional execution with terrific vocals, tight arrangements and fine energy.
Highlights include an amazing rendition of ""Searchin' So Long"", featuring vocalist/ bassist Jason Scheff at his best.  True, he is not Peter Cetera, but he really is a fine vocalist and does have great bass chops.  He also does a fine job on the impossible-to-sing ""If You Leave Me Now"".
The legendary Chicago horns are in fine form throughout with trombonist Jimmy Pankow taking the lead on some of his typically powerful solos.  The classic latin instrumental ""Mononucleosis"" features trumpeter Lee Loughnane on a nice solo section.  Walt Parazaider provides excellent textues on a soprano sax solo during the interlude of ""Just You n' Me"".
A nice bonus for true Chicago fans is a rare performance of ""The Pull"" from the Stone of Sysiphus album that went unreleased. Great tune featuring a solid Bobby Lamm vocal showcasing his well-known talents for penning catchy melodies.
This video is a must-have for all Chicago fans.  Great selection of tunes, great performances, and great production values.",1064620800,11,2256,5.259052924791086
7835484,5,630303232X,"Chicago is still a great band in concert.  The downside is that two key original members are gone.  Terry Kath is easily the greatest rock/jazz guitarist ever.  Peter Cetera was an excellent vocalist and songwriter.  Bill Champlin is a better singer than Kath ever was, but I still miss Kath on guitar.  Jason Scheff is okay, buthe apparently has little songwriting skill.  He is better than Cetera on bass and just as good a singer.  Nevertheless, Cetera's voice is the authentic Chicago sound!  Additionally, it was Cetera's songwriting in the 1980's that gave rebirth to Chicago's popularity.
  All in all it is an excellent video.  However, it would be nice to see a release from the 1970's with all the original members.  A video with all the original members is not available commercially.
  Lastly,Tris Imboden is no Danny Seraphine on drums.  Seraphine was asked to leave due to business disputes.  IT IS ABOUT TIME CHICAGO GETS HIM BACK!!!!",1034208000,5,949,4.9113924050632916
7835485,3,630303232X,"Video and songs are great, but audio on VHS was really bad!! Had to shut off VCR stereo and just play MONO to get rid of static and noise.  Tried it on 5 VCRs- same problem.  Only solution seems for us to wait for a DVD digital remaster.  Any word when that will be available?",987379200,3,276,3.981818181818182
7835486,5,630303232X,"I absolutly love this video. I watch it all the time.  The band seems to get better every year. The line up is just great.  They have a distinct sound. When you  hear one of there songs on the radio you know it them. There is no mistaking there talent. They did something diffrent they have a great hornsection, very fine singers and a great rythem section.  This concert just takes my breath away. Long live Chicago!",984441600,,417,4.376623376623376
7835487,4,630303232X,"Chicago looked like they were born again and loving every minute of it. Performing songs from 1969 all the way to 1993 Chicago looked very strong and the crowd seemed alive all night. My favorite performances were ""Saturday in the Park"", ""Hard Habit to Break"", and ""The Pull"" from the still unreleased album ""The Stone of Sisyphus"". There were a couple things about the concert I didn't like. One of them was that Bill Champlin was only limited to 3 songs on which he sang lead (""Make Me Smile"", ""Hard Habit to Break"", and ""Look ""Away"")  which were all strong singing performances. I think that Bill is a waste of talent considering that Bill is the most versatille musician in the band playing keyboards, playing guitar on 4 songs, and singing background vocals. I think that both Robert Lamm and Jason Scheff are good singers, even DaWayne Bailey had his moment on the last verse on ""I'm a Man"", but Champlin is by far the best singer in the band and they should give him more songs to sing even if they weren't hits.
The next problem is the guitarist DaWayne Bailey. I think that DaWayne is an excellent tenor singer (probably better than Jason Scheff if he is ever given a chance to prove himself in concert). I also think he is a great guitarist but when performing he doesn't seem to be on the right page as the rest of the band. His guitar riffs don't come anywhere close to the riffs played from the original versions of the songs such as ""Hard to Say I'm Sorry"", ""You're the Inspiration"", and ""25 or 6 to 4"". The only songs I enjoyed hearing his guitar playing on was ""If you Leave me Now"" which was done on an acoustic guitar,""I'm a Man"" and ""The Pull"". He seemed out of control on most of the songs he played and I think that's what kept his guitar playing out of the studios and probably is the reason he was fired the next year. If Bill sang lead more and if DaWayne learned how to play Chicago's songs the right way I would give this video 5 stars.",980899200,,1962,4.360655737704918
7835488,5,630303232X,"To anyone who says that the bands line up doesn't rock...You are obviously not a musician. The skill of ALL the musicians from Lamm to Bailey and Scheff is incredible. Tris Imboden is one of the greatest rock drummers in the world. Fact not fiction.  This video is awesome. The sound mix is much better than any of their concerts that I have been to.  This isn't the Chicago that started in the 60's. Don't but this if that is what you are looking for. We can't get that band back back, but we can enjoy one of the rockingest videos and bands out there... Definately worth the money.",977788800,,583,4.339449541284404
7835489,4,630303232X,"This video captures the essence of Chicago's music, from the 60's to today.  Especially noteworthy are the excellent horn section, the vocals of Robert Lamm, and the non-stop show by drummer Tris Imboden.  Chicago  transcends all age groups and this video is for all Chicago fans, from the  subdued to the sublime.",922579200,2,314,4.980769230769231
