7843767,5,6303336914,"If you are a Peter Tosh fan, this is a must see.  If you are interested in the rise of Bob Marley and the Wailers or curious about Rastafari and the influence it's had on music and vis versa, this is a must see.  Peter Tosh was a keen observer and vocal activist, this film does him justice.",1261526400,,291,4.0

""What as it was designed by Jah who sent me here to help to alleviate, to turn the filth and corruption that my people have been inoculated with it's only my duty to teach those who will learn.""(SR)

Peter Tosh August, 1983 - ""The flowers will bloom and the pollution will go away. There will be fresh air and no pestilence. Man has created these things for experimental purposes to promote death and advance technology. But soon the earth will tilt on its axis and begin to dance to the reggae beat to the accompaniment of earthquake. And who can resist the dance of the earthquake, mon?""",1197849600,,637,4.530434782608696
7843769,4,6303336914,"this is a well-made film about the life of peter tosh.  there are some excellent live clips, although, too many come from his u.s. tour in the early 80's and so there is some synthesizer overload going on.  good interviews with rasta heavyweights; the interviews with mortimer planno and bongo israel are worth the price of the dvd.  good reggae movie in general and definitely a good retrospective on the life of tosh.  peter was a bit crazy, but there's no doubt that he was a man of righteousness and a truly excellent songwriter, and the film brings out those elements.",1152057600,2,573,4.643564356435643
7843770,4,6303336914,"Stepping Razor Red X is essential viewing for any reggae fan. While it jumps around chronologically, it is a good intro to Tosh, his music, and his beliefs. My only complaint is that I found some of the re-enactments to be a little hokey. I think that it would have been more effective to show still pictures of Tosh instead of having an actor lip-sync over Tosh's tape-recordings. Overall, though, this is a great movie about a true revolutionary.",1038873600,5,448,4.6835443037974684
7843771,5,6303336914,"This is the most in depth documentation on the great Peter Tosh I have ever seen.  It is almost eerie to listen to the tapes Tosh had been making and how prophetic they were.  It shows Tosh for what he really was, a revolutionary, a visionary, and a reggae master!!  The interviews with friends and relatives give this documentary credibility from the roots of Tosh's past.  One truly gets a sense of where Peter came from, and after all that's half the story.",1002585600,,460,4.506024096385542
7843772,4,6303336914,"An unflinching and unexpectedly moving portrait of musician Peter Tosh. This is not your typical ""rockumentary"", as it delves more into the political and spiritual aspects of its subject as opposed to the the  usual formula of concert footage + backstage drama. One minor criticism,  (personal pet peeve) is the director's over-use of the ""JFK""  style inter-cutting of real footage with actor portrayals to illustrate  some events; but this will not distract most viewers. There are also a few  dubious statements made (and presented as fact);specifically, the  insinuation that Tosh was the the real leader and force behind the Wailers  and that Bob Marley was just a puppydog-like follower. Like the Beatles or  other groundbreaking bands,I think it was more of a symbiotic blend of two  (or more) massive talents that made the Wailers such a powerful influence.  Nitpicks aside-- this is required viewing for reggae fans!",963446400,7,924,5.224489795918367
7843773,5,6303336914,"This video is one I have watched countless of times and will watch it again and again. (I wish it was available on dvd so that the quality would not deteriorate). The words of Peter is that of a prophet, when I watch  this video, I always click to the bible on King David. Somehow they seems  to be very similar. The concert clips are the best.",958003200,3,344,4.119402985074627
7843774,5,6303336914,"I've watched this documentary dozens of times and continue to be blown away by this enigmatic, powerful man.  The beautiful cinematography and seamless incorporation of Peter's recordings add to the message of equality  and justice for which Tosh lived and died.  The film is definitely  sympathetic to Tosh, yet reveals his complexity and shortcomings that  ultimately lead to his downfall.  This is a tape I've shown to all my  friends and family, and will definitely keep to show to my kids.  Keep on  fighting Peter!",952387200,8,520,5.023529411764706
