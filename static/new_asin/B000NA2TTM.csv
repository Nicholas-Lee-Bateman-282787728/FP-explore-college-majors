2763939,5,B000NA2TTM,"Just got done watching this documentary. I thought it was pretty good. It was long enough to cover the subject pretty well and the part that I like the most is that it was balanced in its view of the subject. Che' was portrayed as both an icon and a savior and also as a murderer and fanatic. They had lots of interviews with people who were involved, who knew him and who both loved and hated him. Also a lot of good footage and pictures of the man. If you are interested in the subject or even if you aren't I think you will find the documentary interesting and informative.",1229731200,19,576,4.198198198198198
2763970,4,B000NA2TTM,"Just finished viewing this documentary, and wanted to write a review to balance the four one-star reviews!

The makers of this documentary succeeded in presenting a fair and even-handed portrayal of the life of Che Guevara. I went into it with a moderately strong bias against the man. (I tend to dislike revolutionaries, who generally seem to me brutal and narcissistic.) After viewing it, I am still not a fan, but I am more sympathetic to him than I was before. It's the kind of sympathy that comes from better understanding.

Those on the Far Right will find this portrait to be too sympathetic; those on the Far Left won't like the filmmaker's refusal to make excuses for Che's brutality. Whenever you piss off both extremes, you're probably doing something right.",1324339200,10,769,4.862595419847328
2763971,1,B000NA2TTM,"This is a piece of trash, The movie did not even give 20% credible information. I was shocked when I seen how anti-Che the History network is, maybe they the 1% that this county is seriously hating more and more everyday. I hope they do better job or at least go bankrupt because if they don't tell the truth then it cant be called history its called Fiction like what is being taught in High Schools.",1323561600,3,401,4.2894736842105265

2763973,1,B000NA2TTM,"I threw this in the trash after watching it. This ""documentary"" is more like the CIA/United States opinion of Che's life.

This was put out by the history channel, which is owned by GE (General Electric). GE manufactures weapons for the US military (it's a fact look it up) so they can go out and bomb less powerful countries to expand their empire. The history channel has an agenda and it's doing spin for the US Empire. Che wanted human rights for all, not just rich people. This piece is total misinformation. It is reminiscent of how the FBI said Martin Luther King was a threat to the country and spied on him and countless others who wanted to create a better world for all people and not just the rich.",1305849600,12,1203,6.209580838323354

2763976,5,B000NA2TTM,"This is truly a wonderful, insightful documentary. Che was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, intellectual, guerrilla leader, diplomat, military theorist, and major figure of the Cuban Revolution. I know all the negative reviews come from Cuban-Americans who's famalies fled Cuba in fear of having to be equal with Afro-Cubans, God forbid. If you need proof look at the famalies who fled during the revolution, white, wealthy Cubans who could not imagine sharing their wealth with Cubans of color. The U.S.-backed Cuban general, President and dictator Fulgencio Batista was corrupt and sold out his country along with other wealthy Cuban famalies to the  highest bidder. Cuba was being raped by US corporations and the Mafia while Batista and his wealthy friends turned a blind eye so they could line their pockets with dirty money, money being made on the backs of the poor Cuban people. ""Brothels flourished. A major industry grew up around them: Government officials received bribes, policemen collected protection money. Prostitutes could be seen standing in doorways, strolling the streets, or leaning from windows. One report estimated that 11,500 of them worked their trade in Havana. Beyond the outskirts of the capital, beyond the slot machines, was one of the poorest, and most beautiful countries in the Western world. ""  -- David Detzer, American journalist, after visiting Havana in the 1950s.
 Che may not have been perfect but he did believe in equality, so much that he sacrificed his life defending the poor and opressed people of Latin America. Great story told very well.",1261872000,28,1610,5.28125
2763977,4,B000NA2TTM,"I often view western productions regarding the life of any self-proclaimed socialist/Marxist/anarchist with a great deal of skepticism. The same skepticism I would have if I were in Cuba today with a book about Milton Friedman. However, I believe this documentary gave a relatively balanced look into the life of the world's most famous icon.

The documentary is primarily narrated by one of the greatest authorities on the history of Che, author of ""Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life"", John Lee Anderson. Much time is also given to Felix Rodriguez, the CIA operative who interrogated and carried out orders to execute Che. In one of the best parts of the documentary, American teens who were in Cuba at the time and joined Castro's rebel force, speak on their experiences during and after the revolution. References to Americans assisting in the Cuban revolution are normally quite obscure.

The documentaries greatest success is that is forces you to think regardless of how you personally feel about the man. The tendency when exploring the life of Che is to make him a mini-Castro who posses few thoughts of his own outside of Fidel's authoritarian vision (Fidel's supposed socialism is also called into question). No such perspective is given here. Che is presented as a vocal opponent of both the USSR and subsequently the Cuban Communist Party. He's portrayed as a humanist and completely selfless, commonly sacrificing his one free day of the week to volunteer with the peasantry. Militarily Che is also portrayed as being quite the leader during the Cuban revolution.

Conversely the more controversial moments of Che's history are not neglected. Che's summary executions of traitors is explored on several occasions. Post-revolution when Che began to clash with the Cuban/Soviet leadership, Fidel appointed Guevara head of the ""la cabana prison"" in an attempt to put Che in a less visible role. As head of a prison where war criminals were tried, Che sentenced hundreds to death and quite possibly personally executed some of those found guilty. The notion that some of those killed were innocent is also mentioned.

This documentary truly gives a total depiction of Che's life. Personal history, political ideologies, and testimony from supporters and opponents alike give it a legitimacy few productions have when exploring such a controversial figure. Unfortunately, the documentary's balanced perspective fell apart in the last several minutes of the film for me. Che is deemed as a failure by two of the narrators. After millions have have flocked to the man's ideas and replicated his passion I'm quite sure that's not an objective assessment. His military campaign in Bolivia is certainly questionable (I'm sure Che himself would chalk it up as a failure) and the countless amounts of slave-labor made Che shirts I'm sure has him rolling in his grave. However, the Cuban revolution and the countless movements in Che's name that would proceed his death I'm sure he would smile upon gladly. Furthermore, capitalism and oppressive states have never ceased to come under fire and quite frequently Che's image and message's are those used in anti-capitalist movements, inspiring generation after generation. Of course criticisms still exist of said movements as well as Che's Marxist ideology but, such is the world of politics.

Overall I would definitely recommend to all interested in a fairly-balanced exploration of the man.",1259712000,8,3442,5.216998191681736
2763978,1,B000NA2TTM,"Very funny, this is coming from the man who said to Felix Rodriguez: "" I am worth more alive than Dead to you!"" If you want to know who this coward bubbling sociopath idiot was just reading Exposing Che, and Un Mito O Realidad and Shadow warrior. All these other books come straight from the Source: His family or extremely biased admirers. He was so good at warfare that he got killed because he couldn't even lead bolivian campesinos who were on the left. the irony is he became what he hated most: A capitalist Icon.",1238457600,6,519,4.416666666666667

For example che wrote his kids a letter and within was these words: ""Above all, always be capable of feeling injustice committed against anyone anywhere.

There is no interviews from his family, Fidel Castro or his friends ( only those who are exiled from Cuba).
