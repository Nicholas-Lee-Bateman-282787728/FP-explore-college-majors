8214518,5,B000UR9TS2,"""I thought this movie was very well-written, & although a ""low-budget"" movie, the Actor's in this film Really brought the story together in a Believable way; yes, Adrian Paul may only have Limited scenes, but the movie itself is NOT about him; it's the story of Two small town friends, who find themselves both chasing after a dream, one a ""hopeful"" dream, & the other, a dream with lethal consequences!"" ""All in all, i enjoyed it!!",1297987200,,432,4.697368421052632
8214519,5,B000UR9TS2,This is a wonderful movie. I couldn't believe how well it was.  Adrian Paul is the only reason for buying this movie.  He wasn't in it for very long but for Adrian Paul fans it is enough.,1244160000,2,187,4.027027027027027
8214520,2,B000UR9TS2,I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE IT LISTS ADRIAN PAUL AS SOMEONE STARRING IN IT. IF YOU CONSIDER A MOVIE OVER AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES LONG THAT HE HAS (3) 30 SECOND LITTLE BIT BLURBS IN...THEN YES- HE STARS IN THIS MOVIE. I DONT. IF YOU WANT TO SEE A POST HIGHLANDER ADRIAN PAUL MOVIE- TRY LOST COLONY OR POSEIDON. I WONT SPOIL THE MOVIE AS IT PERTAINS TO THE REST OF THE CAST. THE STORY IS NOT UNFAMILAR AND SOMEWHAT PREDICTABLE. THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS DO AN ACCEPTABLE JOB. UNFORTUNATELY- THE ENDING IS ONE THAT ANYONE CAN SEE COMING.,1231718400,,525,4.313131313131313
