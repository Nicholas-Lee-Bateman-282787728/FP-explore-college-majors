2492571,4,B000E5KULU,"I am thrilled that Season 5 will be available.  While this season lacked Johnny & Dustin, it still had some great story lines. I also enjoyed the new characters Mack and Joey.  I was so disappointed that the characters did not have the opportunity to grow more --  I wish the series had continued longer.",1138665600,6,304,4.490909090909091

2492586,1,B000E5KULU,"Without Johnny Depp, they should have just cancelled the show after the 4th season.  Season 5 is horrible.  It's boring and hard to watch with the actor who replace Johnny Depp's character.",1398816000,,189,4.875

2492589,4,B000E5KULU,It was kinda a weird show. I bought it because I was told the whole series pack didn't include it...but it actually does. So if you have the pack you don't need to buy this one.,1349481600,,177,3.9444444444444446
2492590,4,B000E5KULU,In the show they mention that phenobarbital would show up on a drug test the same as heroin.  Phenobarbital will show up in drug test as a barbiturate.  Heroin shows up as an opiate.  The testing wouldn't confuse the two. I was surprised that they got that wrong.,1346198400,,263,4.4375
2492591,4,B000E5KULU,I know it was a disgrace when Depp left the season and they putt him on the cover although he appears in one episode that was supposed to be in season 4 but still an ok season I mean I did not care for Michael deluise but Michael Bendetti was great. Peter DeLuise appears only in 7 episodes and Hoffs and Fuller are still there. As I said before an ok season.,1345248000,,359,4.0
2492592,4,B000E5KULU,"The description currently listed for this episode is identical to the one for ""Number One with a Bullet"". This episode actually showcases Captain Fuller. He meets a woman whose son attends the school where Joey Penhall has been attending shop class.",1342828800,,249,5.097560975609756
2492593,4,B000E5KULU,"Michael Bendetti joining the cast as Tony ""Mac"" McCann was a good move and Officer Dean Garrett was another okay Charactor that should have stayed with the show. But to not keep Alexandra Powers as Officer Kati Rocky to me was the drop ball as far as the cast went. They hurt the season 4 story lines that were ment to lead in to season 5 and just never could get it back on track. They also let Peter DeLuise leave the show instead of trying to keep him on for the sake of just saving that season. Thats where all interest for the show was lost. You should have had him as a regular cast member for the first half of the show then let him be a special guest star for the other half. letting the final show of the series end with Doug Penhall retiring as a cop. That to me would have been a better ending to the series.

But to get to the point! Its still a okay season but just really hard to watch because of the way it was all handled. If you only lost Depp and added 2 or 3 more characters and kept every one else it could have been better. But they let too many people go and it just could not hold the interest together.",1312243200,,1126,3.982300884955752
2492594,5,B000E5KULU,great show love all the seasons but i do wish when characters were leaving they would say goodbye but the new characters are great i love mcann and joey penhall and all the original characters! if u loved the original 21 jumpstreet youll love this one 2!,1311033600,,254,4.425531914893617
2492625,5,B000E5KULU,"I remember this series from its original run in the late 80s. I loved the Hanson/Penhall duo (gotta love the McQuaid brothers) and the Hoffs/Ioki paring was ok. The only thing I remember from the last season was that Doug Penhall's brother joined the force; I completely forgot about Anthony ""Mac"" McCann.

I found this series on (Netflicks) and have been rewatching the series. I'm now into season 5. This season included a few episodes with Officers Dean Garrett and Kati Rocky. Bringing in these two characters (they were slated to be added to the cast for season 5 but for whatever reasons, it didn't happen) and eventually adding McCann and Joey Penhall was a refreshing change. Overall, these new officers were the second generation of Jump Street Chapel's force; they were mentored by the first generation-Hoffs, Doug Penhall, and Captain Fuller.

I realize that a lot of people may disagree with me, in that I enjoyed all the cast changes to the show. I would have liked to see a sixth season that focused on Hoffs, McCann, Joey Penhall, and Fuller as a more stabilized cast-the show went through a number of cast changes in season 5, and this is reflected in the opening credits throughout the season. I would have liked to see McCann's and Joey Penhall's character more developed and to learn more about their backgrounds. I liked the first generation/second generation idea of Jump Street officers. I also appreciate that the producers (or whomever) realized that Hoffs and Doug Penhall were older and that they took more age appropriate undercover assignments-a counselor, a basket ball coach, etc.

My one minor gripe about season 5 is this: a lot of it was filmed fairly dark. What I mean by this is that shadows and darkness are used frequently. I particularly noticed this in the scenes in the chapel itself. These scenes were a lot darker (lighting) than compared to previous chapel scenes in previous seasons. Maybe darkness and shadows were used as a metaphor to the eventual and upcoming end of the series-just thinking.

As others have pointed out, Johnny Depp (and Dustin Nguyen) are not in this season. By the fourth or fifth episode, I didn't miss Hanson or Ioki at all. The cast changes that were made to the show in the 5th season freshened up a series that was getting a little too stale with the original characters. It is a nice change of pace.",1287014400,3,2373,4.766423357664234
2492626,3,B000E5KULU,"I received 21 Jump Street Season 5 over the holiday season and I just finished up watching it with my wife (this was the first season she has ever seen).  Overall it was ok, but dissapointing.  Judy Hoff and Cpt Fuller both performed admirably as the cast kept changing.  The episodes focusing on each one of them were definitely the highlights of the season.  Home Girls, Poison and the Education of Terry Carver were some of the better episodes.  While Officer McCann performed admirably as a ""Poor Man's Johnny Depp,"" the other cast additions were horrendous, including Joey Penthall (he had some chemistry with his brother, but outside of that, his character was annoying as opposed to being amusing).

The character switching in the 1st couple episodes was unexplained and distracting.  To go from an episode with Johnny Depp to an episode is was a no-name cast was poorly done.  They should have started with episodes starring Hoffs or Penthall and transitioned in some new characters.  The episodes involving high school story lines were far superior to the episodes that took place outside of high school.  Finally, seems odd that the last episode listed Doug Penthall in the credits, but he was not in the episode.  Overall, the Jump Street dynamics worked best with multiple storylines and multiple actors.  For the most part, the last season only involved 2 or 3 main characters as opposed to 4.  It is still worth watching, but it does not live up to the earlier seasons.",1269820800,4,1483,4.837301587301587

2492628,1,B000E5KULU,"This episode is like a pathetic attempt to imitate some cheesy 80's teen horror flick combined with an after school special on peer pressure. For some reason these students are all trapped inside school due to bad weather and the teachers won't let them go home so the students rebel. They run around the halls chanting something stupid while the Jump St gang (minus Ioki) attempt to solve a rape case. I only watched this episode b/c I wanted to see Johnny Depp's last performance as Tom Hanson. This ep was really the last one of season 4 but they put it on the season 5 box set obviously to sell copies since it has Johnny Depp. His performance was weak and the whole episode was lame. Then towards the end, it was like the writers had nowhere to go with this ridiculous plot so Hanson and Hoffs suddenly announce to the mob that they are cops. This doesn't go over well so the mob chases them and starts beating them up. Penhall was posing as a teacher so the students had already locked him up. Finally one girl yells at everyone to chill out with this bullying and the weather lets up so everyone can go home. Only bother watching this episode if you are a Johnny Depp fan and you've just marathon watched seasons 1-4 and now need to see Johnny Depp's final episode of this show so you can have some closure! Warning though: you may not get closure so go back and watch the first 2 or 3 seasons so you can remember the show and Tom Hanson in a positive way...",1265328000,8,1465,4.311594202898551

2492633,4,B000E5KULU,"The loss of Depp should have been a huge loss, but it really wasn't too bad. The storylines are still quite strong, Peter and Holly were just as important to the show, and Michael Bendetti was an excellent addition to the cast. Fox gave up on this show a bit too soon. If you're a Jump Street fan, buy it.",1168732800,3,305,4.1

2492675,5,B000E5KULU,"This season is very under-rated, I love this season just as much as the rest of my Jump Street dvds.  Michael Bendetti and Michael DeLuise are a great edition to the cast.",1144886400,6,171,4.34375
2492676,1,B000E5KULU,"What a blatantly sleazy way to get Depp fans to buy this last season. What a marketing strategy! They must think the buying public is stupid! In spite of the one episode ""Blackout"" that Hanson is in (from season 4), I tried to watch the rest of the shows, and it felt like so much was missing. Ioki was gone too, and it just wasn't the same. They should have just renamed the show as a spinoff. Nope. Just wasn't the same.",1144800000,31,422,4.158536585365853
2492677,5,B000E5KULU,"I love this season just as much as the first 4.  It IS a shame that they used Johnny Depp on the cover to increase sales, but anyone who's seen this season - or maybe who reads these reviews - will learn that Officer Tony ""Mac"" MaCann is just as handsome and sexy and as good of an actor as Depp is.

After the first few episodes that this character appears in, he truely ""fills the void"" that Depp left: MaCann is funny, charming, silly at times, but at the same time mature and great at his job.  He's a moral character, he's a heart-throb, and he's gorgeous: what more do you want besides his last name to be ""Hanson""?

Also, seeing the DeLuise/Penhall brothers together is great.  They look alike, they are funny together & when Doug leaves, I notice Joey taking the ""Penhall"" role, as MaCann takes the ""Hanson"" role on the show.  I don't know how this show was ever cancelled, except perhaps for the lack of characters toward the end of this season.",1143936000,7,954,4.361581920903955
2492678,3,B000E5KULU,"Okay, let's clarify this. Yes Johnny Depp is on the cover and only appears in the one episode. BUT... the box does say that the Blackout episode (a very good one) is his last appearance. Now this episode was filmed for season 4 but for some reason it was not shown until the syndicated season 5. So it does belong on this set. Johnny Depp was so unhappy on the show by this time that he mumbled his lines, wore a patch over his nose and obscured his face with his hair. The rest of the episodes are hit or miss, with characters just disappearing, but it is nice to complete the set even without much resolution.",1143331200,13,611,4.230769230769231
2492679,1,B000E5KULU,Like said before - Shame on you. Using Johnny Depp that prominently on the cover of this season is nasty. There's one episode with him on this box and this one was not supposed to be a 5th season episode but a 4th one. The whole thing is only due to marketing purposes. I only can say: NOT WITH ME!!!!!!,1143244800,22,303,4.066666666666666
2492680,3,B000E5KULU,"The biggest problem I have with season 5 is that ALL 4 of the other seasons were done on single-sided discs with nice cover art, and on this one, they took the cheap road out with double-sided discs, which are more prone to disc errors.  BOOOOO!  They should have held the consistency throughout the series rather than just slipshod this one together the way they did.  It's nice that the series is complete, but they really should have done a much better job putting this set together.",1142899200,19,486,4.563218390804598
2492681,1,B000E5KULU,"Shame on you!.  Using Depp to sell this DVD.  He is only in one episode, ""Blackout"" which was supposed to be in Season 4 but was held back and put is Season 5 as a marketing ploy.  And after 4 seasons, there was no explantion of his or Dustins being gone. Poof!!!Gone. Like they never existed.  I have all four seasons and watch them regularly, but this one....I don't think so.",1142467200,9,378,4.28169014084507
2492682,4,B000E5KULU,"I have to agree that showing Johnny Depp on the cover -- especially that prominently -- is misleading, however, as a fan who remembers that year I have looked forward to the season five collection possibly the most of all. That season never got the acclaim it was due, mainly because of the switch to syndication and the cast changes. Sure, Johnny and Dustin are gone, and Peter doesn't last long, but the new cast members were great. Even the ultra-short-lived new cops who only lasted the first couple of episodes and then disappeared are worth watching again. I remember having a hard time finding the show on TV when season five started, and now I can actually kick back and enjoy those ""lost"" episodes. However, I still wish the marketing people would have played up the existing cast rather than the absent Johnny Depp, because that's sure to incite furor from his fans -- many of whom are too young to remember Jump Street. Sure, his picture will sell DVD's, but why sell DVDs to people who are just going to be upset when they watch it? Doesn't seem like good marketing to me ... Anyways, this DVD is recommended to all Jump Street fans, although Johnny Depp fans will probably want to stay clear of it.",1141344000,15,1211,4.559633027522936
2492683,5,B000E5KULU,This is my favourite season of the show for 2 reasons; Michael D and Michael B. Both great looking and great in the show.,1140220800,,121,4.083333333333333
2492684,3,B000E5KULU,"It should first be noted that Johnny Depp is not a member of the cast of 21 Jump Street during the 5th Season.  He left the show after the 4th season.  The show was then cancelled by Fox and was produced for one more season in syndication.  The only reason Depp was included on the cover of this season set was because ""Blackout"", a 4th Season episode, was held back from the 4th Season DVD Set for this one.  So be forewarned when buying this set that Depp appears in only one episode, and following that he and Dustin Nguyen leave the show, followed soon after by Peter DeLuise.  Only Holly Robinson and Steven Williams remain from the original cast.  Michael DeLuise joins the cast for a bit as Joey Penhall and Michael Bendetti joins the cast as Tony ""Mac"" McCann.  The formula of the show largely remains the same, though the show's production values descrease with the move to syndication, and the cutting of the budget per episode.  This was not a bad season, as per usual with this series, some storylines were weaker than others, but overall the season is entertaining, with Holly Robinson being the focus of most of the episodes, especially after Peter DeLuise and Michael DeLuise leave.  However, again let me just repeat that Johnny Depp appears in only one episode and buyers of this set should know that, so there is no confusion on this matter.",1138752000,45,1359,4.582644628099174
