1848667,5,B00008K76N,"It's a must have for any Tori fan... an amazing video by Sanji featuring recent Oscar winner Adrian Brody. The DVD includes the video, very interesting ""making of the video"" and an interview with Tori.
I think even non Tori fans will enjoy it because of the originality of the clip. It's  a must see...",1050451200,,302,4.490909090909091
1848668,5,B00008K76N,"This is a great DVD single! Not only does it have the full video (which I had never seen on the music channels) but it also has an in depth behind the scenes featurette, an extensive biography, and a great interview. The Behind the scenes look gives you a perspective of all the aspects of the making of the video, including special effects. Great collector's item for a Tori fan!",1050278400,3,380,4.442857142857143
1848669,5,B00008K76N,This DVD is so great.  I really enjoyed the interview where she talks about the concept of a fairytale and her daughter Tash.  The behind the scenes is fun because it goes towards the concept of the song and the directors development.  It addresses the special affects.  Super DVD great for anyone who loves Tori.,1049500800,3,313,4.636363636363637
7984745,5,B00008K76N,"Tori Amos - A Sorta Fairytale was released as a DVD single in 2002. This song appears on her Scarlet's Walk album which is also amazing!!! Oscar-winner Adrian Brody appears in the video as a love interest for Tori. The first time I saw this video I was completely shocked, what a strange but unique video - you have to see it to believe it! Tori looks gorgeous and A Sorta Fairytale is hands-down the strongest single she has ever released. This item has been discounted but seek it out on the web, it's worth buying - enjoy!",1251417600,,525,4.36734693877551
7984746,1,B00008K76N,I am a big Tori Amos fan and was greatly disappointed when I watched this. I paid a dollar for this and I really don't think it was worth it.,1178323200,,141,3.7333333333333334
7984747,4,B00008K76N,"If you're really into Tori Amos this DVD pretty good.  You get the full lenght video for ""A Sorta Fairytale"", but the more interesting part is the making of/interview.  It's really cool to get a behind the scenes look at the shooting of a video (especially one with such weird effects like heads on hands or legs) and the Tori commentary is...well...Tori commentary.  Anyone who's seen her interviews will understand, it's not always easily interpreted, but still interesting to listen to.",1167868800,2,489,5.012345679012346
7984748,2,B00008K76N,"After watching all of Tori's music videos on The Complete Videos 1990-1998, I was greatly anticipating this video. What a let down! The whole video she and Adrian Brody are only legs (until the very end). I understand where she was going with this, but I thought it was stupid to have the whole entire video consist of this. It is such a beautiful song and I think the video should have been as  spectacular.",1118707200,7,408,4.44
7984749,5,B00008K76N,"i just loved it
it's amazing the power that tori carries on her voice and the way that you feel the music.i give her a 10",1076284800,4,121,3.6923076923076925
7984750,5,B00008K76N,"If you are a die hard Tori fan, you must now own all her records and singles.  And to continue your collection, this DVD Single is a great item, you got the ""oficial"" video, the making of..., and an interview, wow, Tori looks beautiful, and she looks happy, calm, gorgeous.  Tori must be one of the best female singers right now.
The DVD packgage is in the standard case, but the yellow color looks good.  By the way, I mean ""oficial"" because if you own the Limited Edition Scarlet's Walk CD, in the DVD, you'll find another version for this song, IMHO, I like more the CD version than the DVD single.  But, this single, the idea of the video is great, and is funny to look Tori over her foot, and Adrien Brody over his arm.  Good Idea.
Finally, as I wrote, no collection of Tori is complete without this Single, so, buy now, you won't regreat this decision.  Greetings.",1055289600,11,870,4.372670807453416
7984751,5,B00008K76N,"Ever since I first bought my DVD player, I've been waiting for Tori Amos to release a DVD.  I wasn't thinking about or hoping for a new release.  All I hoped for was DVD releases of the three VHS tapes (Little Earthquakes, Live in NY, and The Complete Videos).  I waited, and I waited, and nothing.  Finally, I hear that there was a Tori DVD on the way but it was a single for ""A Sorta Fairytale"".  I'll take what I can get.
I had seen a little bit of the video one time before and didn't know what to think of it then.  It looked very strange.  There were two people with heads, but only one body part each (a leg and an arm) and they were morphing into a full body.  That's all I saw of the video before I picked up the DVD.  I loved the song from the cd and the radio.
Now, after watching the video and the rest of the DVD I understand what is going on in the video a bit better.  The video stars Tori Amos and Adrien Brody (Oscar winner for The Pianist).  At the beginning of the video Tori is only a leg and Adrien is only an arm.  They are incomplete people.  Tori and Adrien meet.  There is a little bit of fear and awkwardness in the meeting, but Adrien is persistent and eventually gets to kiss Tori.  It is when they kiss that they begin to become complete.  It is a simple fairytale, but told in a very different way.
The DVD also includes a fairly interesting ""making of"" documentary and an interview with Tori.  Both are interesting, and considering the price (my copy was ... new), this is definitely worth owning for any fan of Tori Amos (Ears With Feet).  I want more Tori DVDs, but this is a nice start.",1054166400,52,1620,4.1050955414012735
7984752,5,B00008K76N,I bought it before they could change there minds about releasing it... now if they could get the clearance to release all of Tori's older videos on DVD I'd buy it also!,1053475200,7,168,4.28125
7984753,3,B00008K76N,"Tori Amos' first ever DVD release is interesting but could have been a lot better. The ""A Sorta Fairytale"" video is features in PCM stereo, the making of is also features and there is an interview with Tori on the disc.
However, the DVD-Single could have at least had a Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track, providing surround sound luciousness. Let's hope she'll think of better audio for a future DVD release.
Gets 3 starts for the added content.",1052956800,10,441,4.666666666666667
7984754,4,B00008K76N,I found the DVD wonderful - a great addition to any Tori collection.,1052697600,3,68,4.3076923076923075
