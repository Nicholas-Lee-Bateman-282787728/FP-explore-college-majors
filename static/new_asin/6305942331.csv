The Tigger Movie is not only super-dooper-ally-ooper cute but  sweet, cheery, heartwarming, bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy, fun, fun,  fun, fun, fun! But the most wonderful thing about this movie is it's the  only one!",964310400,8,376,5.032258064516129
1087910,5,6305942331,"I always wondered why, of all the 100 Acre Wood residents, Tigger was the one I could relate to best. Having seen The Tigger Movie several times, now I know: Tigger is an especially flamboyant cartoon character! While the  likes of Sesame Street's Count Dracula and outrageous Tele-Tubby Tinkie  Winkie have half-heartedly courted the popularity of their exuberant and  colourful audience, Tigger, on the other hand, is unashamedly different and  full of pzazz in his new movie.  How do we know Tigger is so unabashedly  exceptional? Well, even before he took Wol's advice to do as the tree-bound  scholar's sailor nephew had done and look for others 'Of the feline  persuasion', Tigger couldn't resist those loud 60s leopard skins. All that  jumping around was really 100 Acre Wood disco dancing. Furthermore, Tigger  has always been unusual, the animated world's answer to the very cheerful  pianist, Liberace. All the residents of The 100 Acre Wood have always been  individualists, but Tigger stood out on account of his self-confessed  'onliness'. Having previously shrugged off this onliness as a sublime  asset, in his very own spin-off Tigger reassesses his onliness and feels  uncomfortably different, isolated, and alone. All cartoons who take their  fashion hints from Diana Vreeland can have identified with this at some  point. The entire film is about Tigger's attempt to understand his feelings  and to find love and acceptance.  In his previous movie appearances,  ebullient Tigger tried to make a virtue out of his 'onliness' and took  pride in his unique place as Pooh's only neighbour to champion a certain  'je ne sais quoi'. As if the stripes and the mania for aerobicising at  every possible moment were not already a massive clue to the precise nature  of Tigger's unusual proclivities, he loudly proclaimed on many proud  impromptu bounces: 'I'm bouncy flouncy bouncy flouncy fun fun fun fun fun'.  Those who know no better could be forgiven for thinking that Tigger was  expressing a desire to become a drag artist! Shame on us!
In this new  filmic venture, although Tigger shows a certain feistiness in defining more  clearly what it is that makes him stand out in the rural retreat where he  lives, he has not yet overcome his lisp. Never mind. He is in good company.  Mr Tigger shares this trait with many other film characters depicted as  unusual in that way which Oscar Wilde was the first (but not the last) to  say 'dared not speak its name'. There are a lot of egg shells in that 100  Acre Wood and Tigger's boast that he is 'Bounthy, flounthy, bounthy  flounthy, fun fun fun fun fun' is daring enough. It's only the 21st  century. His fans mustn't be impatient.
In The Tigger Movie, vivacious  feline Tigger moves on from his 'onliest' bravado and asks his furry family  to come to terms with his identity. The turning point comes (as it does for  many who find succour in the world of melodrama) when Tigger can no longer  conceal his deep affection for all-singing all-dancing Hollywood musicals.  The high point of the film, and the best animation, comes during Tigger's  star-spangled big band reverie where he sees himself as a flamboyant  character who rolls into one the combined assets of dancers like Rudolf  Nureyev and Fred Astaire and divas like Barbara Streisand and Diana Ross.  Tigger is lucky to have very enlightened neighbours among the denizens of  the isolated countryside hamlet where his residence is located. Members of  his pretend family go out of their way to reassure him that they accept him  just as he is, musicals, leopard skins, aerobicising, and all. To make him  feel at home during his search for other cartoons 'of the feline  persuasion' they even masquerade as clone-like pseudo-Tiggers at a  disco-themed family reunion party.  Although tucked away in a cultural  hinterland, The 100 Acre Wood, it seems, has lessons for the urbane world  of cyberspace and virtual communities. The nieghbourhood is seemingly  deprived of any form of communication with the outside world. There are no  telephones, no satellite links, not even any computers. Nevertheless, Pooh  and his friends have overcome these obstacles before. In a previous  adventure, when all else failed, they sent messages in a bottle (maybe a  samizdat copy of The Pooh Perplex has somehow reached them behind the  Carandache curtain?). It would appear that, despite inhabiting a far flung  settlement cut off from modern technology, all the characters remain  remarkably free of prejudice, phobias, and other hang-ups.  What could be  more civilised than discovering, as Tigger does at the end of his Movie,  that your real family is your so-called 'pretend' family of friends and  allies? The Tigger Movie is a must-see for all Tigger's fans and especially  for those who know what bouncing means.",961286400,35,4834,5.005037783375315

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE TIGGER MOVIE [2000] is a Disney animated family musical comedy-drama film directed by Jun Falkenstein and part of the Winnie the Pooh series. This animated film features Winnie the Pooh's friend Tigger in his search for his family tree and other Tiggers like himself. As such, the story line may be viewed as an allegory about an adoptee's search to understand the meaning of family.

The animated film was the first feature-length theatrical Winnie the Pooh film that was not a collection of previously-released animated shorts, which is the case with 1977's The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. The film features original songs from the Sherman Brothers, the long-time Disney song writing team who are well known for their contributions to other Disney films such as Mary Poppins, Bedknobs and Broomsticks and The Jungle Book, as well as the original Winnie the Pooh shorts.

In the THE TIGGER MOVIE, we join Tigger trying to find somebody to play with, Tigger gleefully bounces around the Hundred Acre Wood, disrupting his friends' attempts to prepare for the winter and accidentally causing a huge rock to fall on Eeyore's house. Rabbit leads the others in trying to remove it with an elaborate pulley system known as his Rock Remover which collapses and Tigger intervenes. He activated his most powerful bounce called the Whoopty-Dooper-Loopty-Looper-Alley-Ooper bounce, knock the rock, which gets tangled with the crumbling Rock Remover along with Tigger's friends) and getting everyone covered in mud, except for Roo instead fell in-between a tree branch and Rabbit to get annoyed that rock remover was ruined by Tigger's bouncing.

Feeling alone, Tigger sulks on a bridge and Roo, trying to cheer him up, asks if there are other Tiggers like him. Fascinated by the idea, Tigger talks to Owl, who explains about family trees. Tigger, taking this literally, heads out to find a huge striped tree and, after not finding one, instead writes a letter to his family. No reply comes and Tigger feels more alone than ever.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Walt Disney Studio Home Entertainment brings us this Blu-ray disc with a flawless 1080p Technicolor image presentation. It also presents you with a nice sharp, crisp, clear, vibrant, rich and vivid images that are all adjectives which best describe the quality of this Disney Blu-ray disc. Foreground and Background were given the totally special Disney Magic and devotion to a long-lasting beautiful animated film that continues to deliver fun in every way possible. Black levels are dark and inky and I didn't notice any major defects in this particular Blu-ray disc transfer. Compared to the past totally inferior DVD release of the animated film, they really cranked it up a couple notches in making sure this looked as sweet as a pot of Winnie the Poohs honey for this beautiful Technicolor transfer! Well done Disney!

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Walt Disney Studio Home Entertainment also brings us a really stunning 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound presentation on this Blu-ray disc and really makes you experience pure audio brilliance. You also experience very sharp clear and clean, no hisses, no over modulation, just rich sound out of every speaker the whole time. From falling leaves to crunching grass to snowy wind to big bounces, all the sound and sound effects are strong and defined. The rear channels offer quite a bit of ambiance to the animated film with the sounds of wind, bees, and more all sounding natural as well as correctly positioned. This is an excellent mix that delivers on both the quiet scenes and the frenetic ones with Tigger jumping around everywhere. It is a real treat when the picture and sound marry together to form something so beautiful and thats what you take away from this Disney Blu-ray disc release. Top marks all round!

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Disney Intermission: Pause the animated film and discover fun family games and activities galore in the Hundred Acre Wood for the first time and with the Disney Intermission feature kicks into action whenever the animated film is paused, featuring a mix of new, specific material mixed in cleverly with elements from the main animated feature film including Harry Gregson-Williams composed music film score. Although these randomly selected animated clips are variously repeated, this is again is a splendid idea that has been implemented very well, aiming itself as a series of fun games for the younger viewers, from spot the difference, counting games and guess whos, among others, all of it very nicely designed, and interacting with the pages of the storybook. Press the Enter button on your remote control and it returns you to the animated film.

Special Feature: A Tigger Tale [2000] [1080p] [1.78:1 [6:22] Here we get to hear some personal anecdotes from everyone involved with the animated film and here we see five individuals sitting around a table together discussing the original A.A. Milne books, with its eventual move to the big screen adaptation, especially seeing all stories, characters, animation, visual design, songs and music that appear in the animated film. We also get to view some rare animated line drawings of Tigger in full mode, plus we get to see some wonderful rare black-and-white still images of Walt Disney and staff. With its brief running time for A Tigger Tale, it really delivers much sort after in-depth information, but despite running just over a smidgen of six minutes, but sure packs in a lot of fascinating information. A nice little bonus is that it is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. Contributors include: Robert Sherman [Songwriter], Jun Falkenstein [Director/Screenwriter], Cheryl Abood [Producer], Toby Bluth [Art Director] and Jeff Johnson [Supervising Animator].

Special Feature: 10 Mini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh Shorts [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1 [24:21] Remember those Mickey Mouse Have A Laugh spots a few years ago, where classic Disney animated shorts were cleaned up, cut-down and re-voiced. Well the same trick has been applied to these 10 mini animated Winnie the Pooh series of shorts  created by abridging segments from various earlier Winnie the Pooh productions and having the current Winnie the Pooh voice cast rerecord most of the old lines with the cast filling in for the other characters, but sadly this is only presented in 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo. On top of all that you can play each mini adventure separate of Play All and they are as follows: Pooh And Tigger [2:32]; The Most Wonderful Thing About Tiggers [2:02]; Eeyores House [2:32]; Someone Like Tigger [2:32]; What Tiggers Do Best [2:32]; Lullabee [2:32]; The Super Bounce [2:32]; Tigger Goes Ice Skating [2:02]; The Jagular [2:32] and Unbouncing Tigger [2:32]. Contributors include: John Cleese (Narrator), Jim Cummings, Ken Sansom, Nikita Hopkins, Gregg Berger, Wyatt Dean Hall, Travis Oates, Tom Kenny, Jack Boulter, Barbara Luddy, Kath Soucie, Bud Luckey, Craig Ferguson, Tom Wheatley, Howard Morris, Kyle Stanger, Tom Attenborough and Frank Welker.

Special Feature: Round My Family Tree Sing-Along Song [2000] [1080p] [1.78:1 [2:45] If you fancy a Sing-Along with Tigger, then feel free to sing along to one of the very bouncy musical numbers from the animated film, and if you don't know the words, well of course you get to see the white subtitle wording appearing at the bottom of the. So why not join in and sing ""Round My Family Tree"" as sung by the cartoon character Tigger [voiced by Jim Cummings].

Special Feature: Kenny Loggins Music Video: Your Heart Will Lead You Home [2000] [1080p] [1.33:1] [4:49] ""Your Heart Will Lead You Home"" was the last song written for the animated film and is a collaborative effort between the Sherman Brothers and singer Kenny Loggins. Richard Sherman described the song as ""a song about the picture, as opposed to songs of the picture."" It marks the only time the trio worked together on a song. Here you see Kenny Loggins in the recording studio strumming along with his guitar. You also get a lot of nice clips from the animated film. What I could not understand is why it was filmed in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio. There has been a lot of negative criticism about this video and the song; well I thought it was a very pleasant little video, which I enjoyed very much.

The idea of finding a birth family is highly glorified and the anticipation of meeting the family that doesn't exist is the bulk majority of the movie.  Although the ending does try to make the point that love is what makes a family, I can see this movie actually introducing unrest in an adopted child and deepening the grief of not knowing that birth family. However, I think it is reasonable to show the movie to adoptive siblings to help them understand what an adopted child might feel about a birth family vs adoptive family so that they can empathize with the child.
There's a scene where he exclaims he's going to go find his ""real tigger family!"" (Meaning not his friends who have tried all they can do to love on him). And he runs away off into a snowstorm. These are ideas I would never want to plant into the mind of my adopted child!!

1088986,4,6305942331,"Being a marginal Winnie the Pooh fan, I let the movies from the early 00s pass me by without watching them.  However, since I have some friends with kids who have The Tigger Movie, I decided I needed to borrow it.  While at first I wasn't impressed, I wound up liking it.

As you might guess, the movie focuses on Tigger (voiced by Jim Cummings), the tiger who loves to bounce all over the place.  Fall is approaching in the 100 Acre Woods, and all of Tiggers friends are too busy getting ready for the coming winter to go bouncing with him.  Even his attempts to help get a giant boulder off Eeyores (Peter Cullen) house turn into a disaster.

Frustrated and a little lonely, Tigger starts wishing for a family.  Thanks to Owls (Andre Stojka) wise suggestion, he starts looking for his family tree.  While Roo (Nikita Hopkins) starts to worry about his friend, Tigger is determined to keep searching, even getting some of his friends into the act.  Can he find his family?

As I said, the first half of the movie didn't impress me much.  It was definitely aimed at a juvenile audience, which is fine, but it wasn't as engaging as the kids films I love.

The songs certainly weren't helping it along.  Even though they were written by the Sherman Brothers, they are mostly forgettable.  This is one thing that never improved, although I did get a kick out of ""Pooh's Lullabee,"" which finds Pooh trying to sing some bees to sleep.

And this is not the fault of the voice cast at all.  They are all great at bringing these classic characters to life.

However, about half way through, something changed and I found myself drawn into the film and enjoying it.  Yes, the plot was predictable and I knew the moral early on.  But that didn't make it any less exciting or fun to watch.  The scene at the end where Tigger gives his new found family gifts is touching and made me smile.

The movie does use the convention of a book that all of the Disney Winnie the Pooh movies use, although its not nearly as prominent as it is in the classic Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

Will I rush out to watch The Tigger Movie again?  Most likely not.  But I did enjoy it and would gladly sit down to watch it again if a member of my family wanted to see it.",1434067200,,2245,4.354216867469879

1089199,3,6305942331,"The Hundred Acre Wood's one and only anarchist spreads destruction wherever he goes.  First, Tigger makes a mess at Pooh's house then he moves onto poor Piglet's place, callously tossing a chair into the fireplace and burning it to ashes.  Undeterred, he also destroys Eeyore's house (not once but thrice).  He ruins Owl's display of family portraits.  The insensitive boob goes on to sing a stupid song about the virtues of bouncing.
This movie is all about Tigger, the rest of the characters are inconvenient guest stars, fodder for Tigger's partiality where devastation is concerned.  In a snit because no one will stop their chores to play with him, Tigger decides what he needs is a family.  He goes in search of one.  His friends try to help but are soundly rebuffed when Tigger decides it isn't enough, isn't what he wants, isn't what he needs.  He's not satisfied until he puts everyone at risk.  Avalanche!!!  Belatedly, he makes amends.
There's a message in there somewhere but I don't think it's the one the filmmakers intended.",1417737600,,1039,4.8522727272727275

I was very skeptical of this, since Tigger is one of my less-favorite characters (though who doesn't laugh when he scares himself in the mirror?), but this is really well done.  The voices are necessarily different, but it has all the charm and good fun of the original without being annoying like so many modern cartoons (including the newest WP movie).  Recommended!",1393632000,,588,4.571428571428571
1089406,4,6305942331,"For starters, both my daughter (who is four and who usually does not watch entire movies) and my son (who is six and who has trouble with movies that have a lot of tension) both sat through this film and enjoyed it. That- in and of itself- makes this movie a winner in my book. In terms of tone, I'd place it right at around the level of the original Mary Poppins movie.

Briefly, The Tigger Movie is a short and sweet film about the trials of Tigger (the very famous friend of Winnie the Pooh) trying to discover whether or not he has a real family. It is a set in the established world of Winnie he Pooh and stays relatively true to the tone of style of the Disney original which makes it feel a bit like those old Disney films from the 50's or 60's.

As a dad, I spend a lot of time trying to screen movies for my kids, both for the obvious reasons but also because my six year old son really gets into movies and TV shows and therefore, movies really effect him in a big way. In other words, scary scenes are extra scary for him. Fighting and violence seems extra violent to him and so on. Fir example, we had to leave the movie theater 10 minutes into Madagascar 3 (a movie most of his friends saw with no problem) because it was too intense for him. To make a long story short: The Tigger Movie worked for him. He got into to the movie and there was enough plot, action and comedy to keep him watching, but not enough to trip his emotional triggers.

As for myself, I was also pleased to note a lack of ""potty humor"" which has become so prevalent in kids movies. No fart jokes. Nobody wagging their behind. No ""bleeped"" curse words. No sly, subversive adult humor hidden in the background. Not even a burp joke or ""gross-out"" humor. This movie really is truly at the young set. I realize that all of the above are embedded in cartoon culture in the post Spongebob/ South Park/ Cartoon Network age, but I feel like my kids will have most of their lives to see that stuff. The don't need that right now.

Anyway, I do recommend it, especially for family viewing with kids age 4-7.",1392508800,10,2084,4.215538847117794

1089919,4,6305942331,"Be prepared to do some bouncing as ""The Tigger Movie"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD!

Since 1926, ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" has been a staple in American pop culture as a family friendly character and stories that many children for generations have grown up with.  And adults who have continued to share that with their own children.

In 2000, ""The Tigger movie"" became the first animated feature film to not feature Winnie-the-Pooh but focus on Pooh's friend Tigger.  Written and directed by Jun Falkenstein (who worked on ""9, ""The Smurfs"", ""Despicable Me"" and directed ""Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of Giving"" and ""A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving"") and would feature songs written by Robert and Richard Sherman  (""Mary Poppins"", ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"", ""The Jungle Book"", ""Charlotte's Web"" and ""The Aristocats"") creating the music for the film.  Their first feature film score since 1971 for ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"".  The film would also feature a collaboration between the Sherman Brothers and singer Kenny Loggins.

The film was originally planned to be a direct-to-video release but when Disney CEO Michael Eisner heard the Sherman Brothers score, Eisner wanted to release the film in theaters.

And it was a great choice for Disney as the film would earn over $96 million in the box office and also win ""Annie Awards"" for ""Outstanding Individual Achievement for Directing in an Animated Feature Production"" and ""Outstanding Individual Achievement for Music in an Animated Feature Production"" and ""Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Male Performer in an Animated Feature Production"".

VIDEO:

""The Tigger Movie"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  The film is vibrant, colorful and the art backgrounds are nicely painted.  We get to see the various seasons of Hundred Acre Wood and was glad to see the emphasis on detail for objects, trees, landscape in the art design.  And as for the character design, the animators kept close to the original style of the characters that many people have grown up with.

If anything, ""The Tigger Movie"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray and I saw no artifacts, banding or any negative issues with this film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Tigger Movie"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and 5.1 Dolby Digital French and Spanish Language Tracks.  The film is primarily dialogue and music-driven and thus more center/front channel.  Dialogue and lossless audio is crystal clear with a little use of the surround channels towards the end (during the more action-based sequences).  But overall, the lossless soundtrack is good.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Tigger Movie"" comes with the following special features:

  A Tigger Tale- (6:22) The crew reunite to discuss their experience of making ""The Tigger Movie"".
  Mini-Adventures of Winnie The Pooh - (24:21) A total of ten (three-minute) mini-adventures featuring Winnie the Pooh and friends.  Included are ""Pooh and Tigger"", ""The Most Wonderful Thing about Tiggers"", ""Eeyore's House"", ""Someone Like Tigger"", ""What Tiggers Do Best"", ""Lullabee"", ""The Super Bounce"", ""Tigger Goes Ice Skating"", ""The Jagular"", ""Unbouncing Tiger"".
  Round My Family Tree Sing-Along - (2:45) Featuring a sing-along for Tigger's ""Round My Family Tree"".
  Kenny Loggins Music Video - (4:49) Featuring Kenny Loggins music video for ""Your Heart Will Lead You Home"".

EXTRAS:

""The Tigger Movie"" comes with a slipcover case and a DVD version of the film presented in 1:78:1 widescreen, English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital with English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.  Also, included is a family tree activity poster with stickers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I know that I'm not the only one who grew up with ""Winnie the Pooh"".  It's been in my family and even my son today was raised enjoying stuffed animals and the animated films (and series).

Having reviewed several of the animated films, ""The Tigger Movie"" having been released in 2001 and also now being released on Blu-ray is the best looking ""Winnie the Pooh"" related animated film on video.  And what makes this film so entertaining and different from other Pooh films is that it focuses on Tigger.

Tigger is one of the most jovial characters ever created but also a character that gets into a bit of trouble because he is always wanting to have fun.  But it's that style that tends to attract the young viewers as the other characters are typically shy or reserved, Tigger is all over the place.

But this time around, you get a fun, energetic film but you also get pulled in by its story because it is quite sad that Tigger has all this energy and wants to have fun, but since the others are not Tiggers, they don't have the same type of drive and thus it leads to Tigger being sadden that there is no family or anyone like him around.  Or is there?

As ""The Tigger Movie"" is a film that does focus on Tigger, we also see another character grabbing the spotlight and that is little Roo, Kanga's son.  Roo is usually featured a few times in a film but this time around, we get to see Roo hanging out with Tigger but also learning from him and trying to be a good ""little brother"".

So, this film definitely gives us a new perspective of characters other than Winnie the Pooh, Piglet or Rabbit.

For the most part, I found ""The Tigger Movie"" to be a wonderful family film.  I watched it with my nine-year-old, at first I was wondering if he would feel that he was too old for this animated film but he was captivated by it and enjoyed it.

There is a lot to learn, may it be one's private space to also the importance of friendship, children can surely learn from ""The Tigger Movie"".  And as for the Blu-ray release, children will also enjoy it for the inclusion of the mini-adventures of Winnie the Pooh plus the included family tree activity posters and stickers.  And also another positive for parents is that the Blu-ray does come with a DVD, so definitely handy for those going on long commutes or a film for children to watch during vacation time.  And as mentioned, seeing this animated film in HD on Blu-ray, it looks and sounds great!

Overall, if you are a parent looking for a safe, fun and touching family film, you can't go wrong with ""The Tigger Movie"".  Recommended!",1354320000,,6329,4.913289349670123
1089920,5,6305942331,This movie is perfect for my daughter who is just three years old. It keeps her interested and makes her laugh,1354147200,,110,4.285714285714286
1089921,5,6305942331,Our child LOVES this movie.  Happy to watch it over and over if we would let him.  We've certainly gotten our money's worth out of it and we've only owned it for about a month.,1352073600,,176,4.0
1089922,5,6305942331,"Tigger has often sung that ""the most wonderful thing about Tiggers is I'm the only one."" In this movie, he starts to question that. Why is he the only Tigger? Where are all the other Tiggers? Roo asks a pretty powerful question: ""I've got a momma. Don't you have a family somewhere, too?"" Tigger seems inspired by the question, and starts trying to connect with his family. Tigger experiences doubts, questions, fantasies, anger, rejection, and questions. Why has no one told him about other Tiggers? Why have his friends lied to him?

Tigger leaves the neighborhood in search of the Tiggers he imagines to be his real family. He doesn't find the other Tiggers, but does realize that his friends love him, and that because of that love, his friends are his family. Tigger declares Roo to be his brother by the end of the movie.

This is a good movie for adoptive families. This song-filled, animated movie features familiar Disney characters: Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Kanga, Roo, Owl, Eeyore, Rabbit, and Christopher Robin. It will most likely appeal to younger children, perhaps up to age ten. However, the theme of longing for a relationship with birth family members is relevant to older children as well. Older children might be convinced to watch The Tigger Movie as part of a family night, and would likely benefit from it.

Parents and friends of adoptees watching the movie can consider how Tigger is feeling, and can place themselves in the roles of the other characters in the film: can they see themselves being loving like Kanga, supportive like Roo, well-meaning but misguided like Owl and Pooh, or cranky about the search, like Rabbit?",1351641600,6,1657,4.868794326241135

1089925,5,6305942331,Great movie for my 4 year old daughter. Watched it over and over again many times. Keeps her entertained for some time which is unusal,1349136000,,134,4.4
1089926,4,6305942331,"I've never been a big Winnie the Pooh fan. As a child who grew up in a household full of sic-fi nerds, the 1,000 Acre Woods really didn't hold any fascination for me. I was more interested in a future world where fully dressed apes spoke to each other and tortured humans the same way they had been.

Who wants to hang out with a bunch of bears, kangaroos, and rabbits in the woods when you could fly around space with Luke Skywalker battling stormtroopers and Darth Vader in a galaxy far, far away? I may not feel an emotional tie to Winnie the way many children and their parents do, but I can enjoy one of their adventures every once in a while.

Somebody loves the cuddly little yellow fella and his cute cast of merry friends. The critical and audience reception to last year's big-screen film ""Winnie the Pooh"" proved there is still interest in the honey-loving animal. That was obviously one of the motivations for Walt Disney Home Entertainment's release of ""The Tigger Movie"" on Blu-ray for the first time.

Tigger longs for a family of his own kind. He searches high and low for any members of his orange and black striped breed but can't seem to locate any. Can his friends help him find his direct relatives while teaching him the real definition of friends and family?

This movie has a message just like all Disney movies do. It concentrates on the importance of friends and shows viewers that your family isn't necessarily made up of people you're immediately connected to by blood. Families are made up of individuals who care for each other but don't share the same lineage.

The world of Winnie the Pooh is timeless. Obviously, that's part of the attraction to the stories and movies. Everyone wants to escape to a fantasy world like Christopher Robin. They want to hang out with their childhood toys and forget about all the cares of the world for a while.

The high-definition transfer of the movie serves the hand-drawn animation well. It brings out all the vibrant colors in the film. All the songs, dialogue, and background effects mix well together in an expansive 5.1 surround mix.

Bonus material for this will please consumers and their children. They include 10 ""Mini-Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" shorts, ""Round My Family Tree"" Sing-Along Song, and Kenny Loggins' music video for ""Your Heart Will Lead You Home."" It also contains the interactive Disney Intermission and the featurette ""A Tigger Tale.""

The Blu-ray ""Bounce - A - RRRific"" Special Edition of ""The Tigger Movie"" is a great addition to the Disney library for fans of Winnie the Pooh. Even though it concentrates on the bouncy tiger, there's still plenty of the lovable bear in the movie to please enthusiasts. It's a wholesome movie that families can enjoy together over and over.",1347235200,,2773,4.726708074534161
1090005,5,6305942331,"I haven't seen this movie in forever and it brought me back to my Winnie the Pooh loving days.  What is so great about this movie is Tigger is the star (As opposed to Winnie the Pooh.)  It features great songs and bouncing fun.  The animation is bright and fun, still somewhat original.  The story line is great too, involving Tigger looking for his real family and then realizing he has his friends as family.  I think it shows that you have family everywhere and that is how I explained it to my boys.  Overall, this is an adorable DVD for any child, especially the Tigger fans out there!",1346889600,,590,4.36697247706422
1090006,4,6305942331,"Even though it was produced by Walt Disney Television Animation, The Tigger Movie is one of a handful of direct-to-home-video Disney animated features that had a respectable run in theaters. It's also the last feature film with original songs by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.

And find songs they are. My favorite is ""Round My Family Tree,"" which is chock full of clever lines (and visual in-jokes, including a reference to the Rankin/Bass Saturday morning cartoon, Jackson 5ive). The end credits introduced ""Your Heart Will Lead You Home,"" which has now become an easy listening standard, co-written and sung by Kenny Loggins.

It's also the first time the Sherman song, ""The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers,"" is sung to completion onscreen. In the earlier films and TV shows, Paul Winchell (Disney's original Tigger voice) sang four lines of the song, but in The Tigger Movie Jim Cummings (the current Tigger) sings the entire song. Historically, actor Sam Edwards sang the whole song first, but on Disneyland records instead of films.

The Tigger Movie makes a nice companion to all the original Walt Disney featurettes, or the compilation film, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, as well as the recent theatrical Winnie the Pooh. The storyline is simple in the Milne style and meanders on purpose -- the world of Pooh and friends is simple, direct and free of extraneous spectacle.

My only issue with The Tigger Movie is that its success, arguably thanks to the Shermans, did not result in their being involved with the follow-up, Piglet's Big Movie. Instead, Carly Simon handled the music without the brothers, which is fine, but somehow not the same.

The new ""Bounce-a rrriffic"" special edition is most notable for how great it looks in Blu-ray. It contains the same features as the 10th anniversary DVD (though some features are now exclusive to the Blu-Ray). For collectors, please note that the new edition does not include two episodes from The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh TV series.

Among the new bonus features is a collection of very short vignettes called ""The Mini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,"" basically edited scenes from the ""Pooh"" shorts and The Tigger Movie.

What's interesting is that these mini segments are narrated by John Cleese, who also added his unique narration to the recent Winnie the Pooh feature. The voices of Sterling Holloway and Paul Winchell are replaced here by Jim Cummings, so it's interesting to consider the similarities and occasional differences between the performances.",1346284800,,2543,5.054892601431981
1090007,5,6305942331,"The Tigger Movie is a 2000 Disney animated feature film and the first Winnie-The-Pooh movie where Pooh is not the star. In this film, Tigger enjoying the 100-Acre Wood bouncing his way into all sorts of trouble, then one day, Roo ask Tigger if he has a family and prompted Tigger to set of an adventure to find his family of Tiggers, only to learn that there's a family that love him at home. The special features includes selected scenes from the movie and sneak peeks of other Disney favourites like the Rescuers 2-disc DVD, Brave, The Aristocats, Tinker Bell and The Secret of the Wings and the upcoming Disney/PIXAR adventure Planes. The Tigger Movie is one of the best Disney DVD's to enjoy with children as well as grown-up's. :)",1346112000,,735,4.6183206106870225
1090008,4,6305942331,"The 1.78:1 presentation is a slight shift from the 1.66:1 framing of previous DVDs, this means a sliver of picture has been cut off from the top & bottom for this Blu-ray release.

WHAT'S MISSING?
Missing here but included on both of The Tigger Movie's previous DVDs: a 16-question trivia game, which mastering led to a 90-second reward video on Pooh's origins and author A.A. Milne; a 3-round, 18-question ""Thingamajigger Matching Game""; a ""Round Your Family Tree"" guide to getting genealogical with your own family; a 32-screen DVD Storybook to read yourself or have read to you; and an original Tigger Movie theatrical trailer (which I must clarify was largely just a preview of Tigger and Roo's Whoop-De-Dooper Loop-De-Looper Ali-Ooper Bounce and not the standard preview that delightfully featured Third Eye Blind's ""Semi-Charmed Life"").

Also missed here are the two episodes of the Emmy-winning '80s/'90s ""New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" series that were added for the 10th Anniversary Edition DVD. The 12-minute ""King of the Beasties"" and 11-minute ""Tigger's Houseguest"" lacked the show's most memorable aspect (the theme tune and title sequence montage), but were still charming inclusions whose absence is felt. In addition, the 10th Anniversary DVD was one of Disney's few non-Blu-rays to include a digital copy disc. Seems like that would have been incredibly easy and fitting to include again here, but no such luck.

So you may want to hold on to your old DVDs to keep the original bonus material and sell off the DVDs included here.",1345852800,,1550,5.118577075098814
1090009,5,6305942331,"I always love watching movies with my kids that have characters from my own childhood.  It makes me feel nostalgic and closer to them at the same time because it bridges the gap in our generations when we share something in our childhoods. It makes me feel like a kid again in a way that today's new cartoons don't.

Winnie the Pooh is a long loved classic and his popularity has not faded throughout the years.  Even in stores that don't typically sell character clothing you can usually find an exception with Pooh!  He is an American staple and since he's already stood the test of time, will probably be around for future generations.  That is why the much anticipated Tigger movie was bound to be a hit in my home and across the country!

I love that the format for Pooh movies has not changed. It's narrated like a storybook and you get to dive into the story.  The graphics have also remained the same.  It looks just as I remember it.  I love that even with all they can do in movies today technologically; Pooh hasn't been altered as a true classic shouldn't!

While Pooh has always been the main star, Tigger gets his shot in the spotlight and as he states at the beginning, it's about time!! Tigger is a happy go lucky Tiger who loves nothing more than to bounce on his tail all day in the hundred acre woods with his friends.  He tries to get his them to bounce with him one day but they are all too busy.  While feeling slighted by his friends, a visit with Owl makes him realize that he doesn't have a family.  He goes in search of them, leaving his friends behind.

When Tigger's friends grow worried, they go to look for him.  Just like a family, when one of their own is missing they all come together!  Tigger's search is fruitless and just when he sinks into the depths of despair, his friends arrive!  He
realizes that THEY are his family and have been all along.  He has been looking for something that was right in front of him.

As usual, a great story with a beautiful moral for kids to learn. My kids have a family but it was a nice opener of a conversation about the importance of friends and how some can be as close as family.  I myself have been blessed with great friends that I'm closer to than some of my family by blood.  Leave it to Disney to hit another homerun with their movie and their message!",1345420800,4,2332,4.302752293577981

1090134,4,6305942331,"The Tigger Movie is one hour and eighteen minutes long and was released in theaters on February 11, 2000. The movie starts off with Tigger bouncing around the Hundred-Acre-Woods and in doing so bothers some of his friends with his bouncing. When Tigger bounces off a rock, the rock lands on Eeyore's home and smashes it. Rabbit has come up with a plan to fix Eeyore's home. Tigger show up and does his Whoopty-Dooper-Loopty-Looper-Alley-Ooper bounce. Tigger had good intentions, but his Whoopty-Dooper-Loopty-Looper-Alley-Ooper bounce send everybody into a mud pit and they wind up getting covered in mud. This gets everyone upset saying the reason they don't with Tigger is because they are not tiggers. Tigger leaves his friends felling a little down on himself and Roo find Tigger and tries to cheer him up. Roo asks Tigger does he has any family Tigger is awestruck that there might be other Tiggers out there and Tigger and Roo head over to Owl's home for help to find his family. Owl talks about his family tree and Tigger start immediately looking for a tree with Tiggers to it. When Roo and Tigger do not find the tree the two of them head back to Tigger's home and Roo suggest that Tigger write a letter to his family. After waiting for a long period of time, Tigger gives up that there are other tiggers out there.

Roo, feeling sorry for Tigger, gets Piglet, Owl, Kanga, Eeyore, and Winnie-the-Pooh together to write a letter to Tigger to cheer him up. Tigger finds the letter the next day in his mailbox and is excited about the letter and wakes everybody up about his letter. Tiggers tells everyone that his family is coming to visit him. The gang is shocked because no one put that in the letter. Owl asks Tigger about the letter and Tigger tells him you have to read between the lines. Tigger sets off to his house to get ready for a family reunion. One by one the gang tries to tell Tigger that there is no family reunion, but just don't have the heart to do it. Roo comes up with an idea to disguise themselves as others tiggers. The plan starts off perfectly, but when Roo decides to do the Whoopty-Dooper-Loopty-Looper-Alley-Ooper bounce his mask comes off and Tigger believes that the gang thinks that Kanga, Roo, Owl, Piglet, Eeyore, and Winnie-the-Pooh are all trying to make him look like a fool. Tigger leaves his him vowing not to return and goes out looking for his family in the middle of a snow storm. Roo is upset and goes over to Pooh's house and Winnie-the-Pooh suggests that an expedition and goes to Rabbit's house to lead the expedition. Rabbit leads the expedition with Roo, Pooh, Piglet and Eeyore to assist in finding Tigger. The group finds Tigger and during the middle of the conversation Tigger causes an avalanche with his shouting. Tigger is able to get all his friends in a tall tree, but is unable to save himself. Roo uses the Whoopty-Dooper-Loopty-Looper-Alley-Ooper bounce to go after Tigger and the two uses the Whoopty-Dooper-Loopty-Looper-Alley-Ooper bounce to rescue them from the fall. In the end Tigger realizes that the residents of the Hundred-Acre-Woods are his family. Overall I did enjoy the with the exception of the rescue part. I just thought the movie could had have a better ending to it. The Tigger Movie gets a B+.

Your friends are family too, so you're never alone even if you're the ""only one"" who is into a certain thing or can do a certain talent.

Being one of those adopted kids, I had a bit of a hard time understanding well...everything back then. The Tigger Movie was one of the few best movies I've seen that helped me understand more about what family was and if it was worth it to drop everything I had then in my life just because I didn't know where my biological family was or who.

Usually, if a picture is letter boxed, it will put two equal bands on either side of the picture.  But this DVD is strange -- the letter box appears ONLY on the left side.  On the right side, the picture extends all the way to the right edge of my plasma tv.

Haven't used the digital copy yet.

A clarification: the product title says ""2-Disc DVD + Digital Copy.""  I wrongly understood this as two DVDs and a digital copy.  This really means you will receive two disks -- the first disk is the DVD and the second disk is the digital copy.",1275523200,3,790,4.038709677419355

First of all, the old Pooh movie is in fact a collection of short episodes and your child does not have to watch it all at once. This feature in 77 min long which is a lot for a 3 yr old. The worst thing is, however, the plot. The Tigger is SO overbearing in his efforts to find a ""true"" family that at times you just cannot help but roll your eyes and sigh. He also tears up several times during the movie, as do other characters, which creates unnecessary emotional tension. And why does the closing sequence have to be so intense? with all the screaming, crying, avalanche descending, etc.? I do not want my daughter be exposed to all this emotional nonsense, which is completely unnecessary. The first Pooh movie is kind, funny, slow-paced, witty and a joy to watch even for us parents. This feature does not come even close. It goes on the shelf to rest until my little one is at least 7-8 years old.",1250899200,6,1082,4.257281553398058
1090337,4,6305942331,"There have been so many Pooh-related feature films, direct-to-video films and television series that it's getting difficult to keep track of them (word is that there is another theatrical feature in the works). To the best of my recollection, ""The Tigger Movie"" was produced by the television division but was very successful in its theatrical release and was followed up with ""Piglet's Big Movie.""

This is actually quite a nice film. The amazing thing about these characters is how flexible they are for so many stories. The plot here revolves around Tigger's family background and his search for his ""family tree."" The animation, apparently done in Japan, is very fluid and suggestive of the earlier films -- and the domestic artists behind it are among the best in the business, including Floyd Norman and Toby Bluth.

John Fiedler, as Piglet, is the one remaining cast member from the original films, with Jim Cummings voicing Pooh and Tigger and none other than John Hurt taking over the narration from Sebastian Cabot.

It sure is nice to see ""Songs by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman"" in the credits. This was technically their last film for Disney, though its success surely should have resulted in others. My favorite of their songs is ""Round My Family Tree,"" but they all have the delicate charm of their other Pooh songs. They also collaborated with Kenny Loggins on ""Your Heart Will Lead You Home,"" which got a lot of airplay.

The DVD offers a handful of bonus features -- several games, mostly, plus a storybook version read by the great Corey Burton and a digital copy. But it is particularly good to see two short episodes from the Emmy-winning ""New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" series. Each episode relates to the plot of the feature. Wouldn't it be great if the series was packaged season-by-season on DVD? Hmm?",1249516800,23,1841,4.853503184713376
1090338,4,6305942331,"""Mostly I'm happy... but now all at once I feel so lonely,"" sings a uncharacteristically melancholy Tigger in this year-2000 theatrical film, after his Hundred Acre Wood pals finally reject his manic bouncing behavior. Determined to track down ""someone like me,"" the irrepressible stuffed tiger has several adventures. He eventually learns that family members come in all shapes and sizes, and not necessarily from the same family tree.

Compared to most Disney sequels ""The Tigger Movie"" has a lot to offer. It's sweet, with absolutely no hostility, and no more violence than a few bee stings. The animation is surprisingly good -- a hallucinatory revue of history's greatest Tiggers in references to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brady-Bunch/dp/B000MGBSEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brady Bunch</a>, the ""Jackson 5ive"" Saturday morning cartoon series, Jerry Springer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Seven-Year-Itch/dp/B000JF5TXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Seven Year Itch,</a>&nbsp;even 1930s&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gold-Diggers/dp/B000E0OE1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gold Diggers</a>&nbsp;films -- while backgrounds often retain the soft watercolor look of the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Many-Adventures-of-Winnie-the-Pooh/dp/B000OLGCF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.</a>&nbsp;For the most part Tigger's sunny enthusiasm is on full display, as are his absoposilutely twisted takes on the English language. All the other classic Pooh characters appear too, including Winnie the Pooh, Rabbit, Piglet, Eeyore, Owl, Kanga, Roo, even Christopher Robin.

The voice talent is good, though the only voice from the original film is John Fiedler as Piglet. Both Tigger (originally Paul Winchell) and Pooh (originally Sterling Holloway) are voiced by Jim Cummings, recognizable to Playhouse Disney fans as the voice of Pete on the series ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse."" The narrator (originally Sebastian Cabot) is voiced here by John Hurt, who portrays Mr. Ollivander in the Harry Potter films as well as Professor Oxley in 2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indiana-Jones-and-the-Kingdom-of-the-Crystal-Skull/dp/B001DTPZNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a>.

In short, ""The Tigger Movie"" is the best of Disney's Pooh sequels. Preschoolers will especially love it, and though the oddball story line has some obvious plot holes (stuffed animals have birth parents?), parents can sit through at least one viewing with relative ease.

This time, our hero is the wildly orange feline Tigger, who in the eve of winter doesn't want to get ready like the rest of his friend, but instead wants to pay and have fun. The rabbit suggests finding other tigers to share his childish pleasures. And that's how Tigger begins the search of his family.

1090495,5,6305942331,"Sitting on the couch with my 2 year old son, I've become something of a connoisseur of children's movies at this point.  To be blunt, most of the modern ""Pooh"" films from Disney are pretty much garbage.  The Piglet and Roo movies are especially painful, and got tossed out after about 1/2 a viewing each.  In both of those, the characters are just being yanked and shoved through the motions by a giant, souless marketing machine that is determined to squeeze yet more cash out of them, even if it has to kill them in the process.
This ""Tigger Movie"" is different though.  Again and again I found that it moved me to tears, and the story, animation and writing all hit home, almost like they were created by people who actually cared deeply about what they were doing.

but i wandered much farther today than i should and i can't seem to find my way back to the woods

count all the bees in the hive
chase all the clouds from the sky
back to the days of christopher robin and pooh
This is a tough review for me to write as I don't want to offend the people who liked this film. While I think it was a good story, I think it forgot its place. I would love to say The Tigger Movie is full of rouncy trouncy pouncy fun fun fun fun fun. But in spite of all the smiles on the cover. I was a little surprised to see Tigger spending most of the film in a blue funk and wrestling with some heavy duty family issues.
 Tigger being a little too much fun for the others is advised to go find someone who likes to bounce.  Tigger goes out looking for someone like himself.  Gone for days, Tigger returns disappointed. Hearing about how everyone has a ""family tree"" Tigger takes it literally and writes a letter addressed to his tree. Noticing how profoundly disturbed Tigger was getting waiting for a response, Roo gets everyone in on writing Tigger a phony letter from his family.  The letter snaps Tigger out of  his anxious state and begins planning a huge party.  Tigger is totally invested in his excitement of having his bouncy family there. Uh oh, bigger trouble. The only way to maintain the illusion is for his friends to dress in Tigger outfits. The outfits are cute but one falls off and Tigger freaks out. He becomes very upset at having been betrayed and having his illusions dashed. Tigger now refuses to accept that he doesn't have a family goes of on a quixotic quest to find his family tree. Eventually he is overwhelmed by a terrible blizzard, but spots a barren tree he thinks must be his. Of course it is not really a tigger tree but Tigger convinces himself they must be on vacation and sits alone in the cold, warming himself with his delusion. Meanwhile everyone in the 100 acre woods are concerned about Tigger being out in the storm. Bravely they hunt him down and plead for him to come down from the tree. Clinging to the false hope of a returning tigger family and still angry and embittered he shouts ""NOOOOOO!"" with such force that he creates a snow avalanche. This disaster snaps him out of his delusion and eventually Tigger realizes that its really his friends who are his family and having a real family is not so important.  Tigger fortunately becomes his old self again.  But while watching  the film I was saying to myself...""Wow, Tigger is having some real heavy duty psychological issues.""  Tigger is struggling with the idea of not being accepted for who he is, family abandonment, and has became obsessively delusional because he is unable to cope."" For me it was a strange choice to have a character in a Pooh story to be spend 90 minutes trying to fill a psychological void in his personality. What a departure from the simple Tigger who only loved to bounce and tell the world how unique he was.  I was not sure I wanted to see a Tigger who can become brooding and enraged and I would rather remember him as the simple joyful expression he was.  Everything about the world of Pooh is uncomplicated. And in the world of cartoons, Poohs gentle emotional simplicity made it unique. I think children will (and do) find the movie entertaining. Yet I wonder if we ever will be able to find our way back to the 100 acre woods where the biggest problems were helping Eeyore find his tail, or watching Pooh struggling to remove his nose from a Hunny jar.",996192000,2,3996,4.385135135135135

It makes Tigger the main charactet Tigger, who really is better as just a character on the side.  They make Pooh seem dull and lathargic, and he doesn't have the same-well-personality.  Roo adds another element of disappointment, for Roo is made out to be more annoying than ever.  Piglet just doesn't have the same jitteryness either.  I suggest that you rent this movie before spending your money on it.",984009600,4,548,4.666666666666667
1090559,5,6305942331,"It's hard for me to begin expressing why I feel this is such a superior film. On one hand, the plot is something I, as a 21-year old male, can easily relate to. In addition, this film has an artistic beauty and quality to it that I haven't experienced since Beauty and the Beast.
The Tigger Movie is a captivating, timeless movie-comparable to the NeverEnding Story. It gives us all a glimpse of what it's like to be a child, particularly in terms of innocence and imaginiation. Another quality it shares with the latter film is that the more times you view the movie, the more appeal you realize it has.
Tigger is a lonely sort, despite his overconfidence and assertive personality. Something all children, teenagers and especially adults can identify with. His friends, being the ideal group of friends that they are, only mean to help boost his spirits, but unfortunately their intentions are mis-read by Tigger, who sees their masquerading as members of his family to be insensitive (excellent emotional development-something I wouldn't have imagined coming from past viewings of the previous Pooh series). After an emotional exit, he sets off on a quest to find his true family, the sort that bears legitimate resemblence to him.
As could be expected, his friends worry about him and eventually go on a search mission for him. What ultimately happens is a revelation for Tigger as he discovers that bonds are made of emotional ties over physical resemblences.
In addition to showcasing the ever-popular Tigger, I was pleasently surprised that this film also shows emphasis on some of the previously less-featured characters, in particular Kanga, Owl, and the eternally young Roo. All three characters are voiced and individualized very convincingly. Gopher is, fortunately, nowhere to be seen.
The animation here is among the most inspired I've seen, featuring stunning backdrops. Some of the characters look a bit different (especially Rabbit) from what I remember, but overall the animation and artwork is obviously movie-quality, rather than the abysmal video-sequel stuff Disney's been churning out over the last several years. This is a vast improvement, both artistically and plot-wise, over the more recent Pooh animated series and D2V sequels, which gives me hope for more theatrical releases starring these always-refreshing characters.
There are so many scenes in this movie that stand out to me. The beginning scene-a panoramic view of the bedroom of Christopher Robin-reminded me of my own childhood belongings. The scene where Kanga speaks to Roo at bedtime reminds me of the innocence I used to have at a young age, and the innocence I think we all tend to overlook or dismiss as ""immaturity"", when in fact it seems we'd all be better off retaining it. The obvious excitement Tigger has upon seeing his *masqueraded* ""family"", and the crushed blow it deals to his emotional high when it's revealed it was all an act, however well-meaning. Such a magnifently produced film, full of scenes that are filled with relevancy instead of pop-culture one-liners and sidekick-stealing shenanigans.
All in all, this is a tremendous movie. It's a perfect movie to suit whatever your mood is, whether depressed, sad, neutral, happy, etc-with friends, family, or by yourself. It's a timeless film about hope, love, and above all else, being a true friend. What more could a person ask for? Highest recommendation for anyone of ANY age.",981331200,,3440,5.090265486725664
1090560,2,6305942331,"Okay, here's a rundown of what The Tigger Movie has to offer for teens who are trying to look cool so their friends won't totally hate them:
1. There's one interesting song number where Tigger talks about his family.  You see all kinds of Tiggers, from a Jerry Springer Tigger to a Marilyn Monroe Tigger.  It's pretty interesting.
2. The movie can be campy sometimes if you're in the mood.
3. If you play the guitar, try playing that simple guitar picking that's found in the movie and impress your little sister.
4. It'll make you appreciate good, family films like Fargo and Bringing Out the Dead.  Go buy them so Amazon can make some money.
Well, that's it.  I wouldn't compare it to Disney's Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc., but for the wee kids, it's not bad.  The songs aren't really memorable, but look at the bright side: that means they won't be stuck in your head!",980812800,2,878,4.49685534591195
1090561,5,6305942331,This is a fantastic DvD for the whole family. This movie is my favorate of all the pooh movies. Tigger is given alot of depth here. Great story line and Grade A animation.  If you own a surround system your in for a treat. Incredible music and effects. I hope disney does another film someday with Tigger as the main character.,972777600,16,327,4.360655737704918
1090562,5,6305942331,"For those long-time Pooh fans who were as disappointed as we were  in Pooh's Grand Adventure, this is a return to the art and wit of the original Pooh.  We were both pleased and surprised at the quality of this film after the abbysmal string of sequels produced for the made-for-video market.  Of course, we're also big Tigger fans, and think it high time he starred in his own movie...  This one's a winner!",972432000,5,408,4.472972972972973
1090563,5,6305942331,"Though not as great as the original ""Pooh"" cartoons, The Tigger Movie is a magical, gentle addition to the Winnie the Pooh franchise.  The story centers around comic relief character Tigger, and his search to find others of his kind.  It turns out that being the only one is not all it's cracked up to be.  When the other residents of the Hundred Acre Wood, lead by a well-meaning Roo, write a letter to Tigger from a fictional ""family"" of Tiggers, Tigger thinks it's all working out perfectly.  Unfortunately, the charade can't go on forever... and it all leads to a thrilling snowy climax at the edge of the Hundred Acre Woods.
Tigger Movie is a story about belonging... about being part of a family.  The message of this heartwarming film is that your family consists of those who love you as well as those who look like you.  Everyone can belong, and the bonds of friendship are stronger than steel.
Kids will relate to the wonderfully acted Roo, and parents and adults will appreciate and be touched by this tale of courage, loyalty, and love.
The animation is much like that of the original cartoons, and the backgrounds are beautiful.  The film's songs were written by the Sherman Brothers, who wrote the original Pooh tunes.  I give this film my highest recommendation.",972345600,19,1277,4.695067264573991
1090641,3,6305942331,"Bit it should have been a bit longer. 77 minutes is not enough. I have always loved Disneys animation of the Winnie the Pooh tv show and I was way excited when I first learned of this movie. 100 acre wood looks magical and is presented very well on DVD.

The story itself is a bit childish but still manages to have balls when it has Tigger FAIL to find his family. Although I would have liked him too I respect the ending they went for.

Although this film isn't to everyone's tastes (I know it seems a little fruity a guy of 20 can like this film) I say you should buy this DVD. It's pefect child fodder and good entertainment. Not just family entertainment. Should be longer though.

The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and is anamorphically enhanced at 1.66:1.",971136000,12,752,4.28169014084507
1090642,4,6305942331,"Every review so far has noted the plot to this movie so I'll skip that and move onto my thoughts of the movie which is an excellent movie for kids and Tiggers of all ages. Simply put, Disney once again has given the world a movie that is clean and fun for everyone and is very well done. Sure the animation is a few notches down from their typical theater run movie but its still effective enough and is a bit above the typical Pooh fare. I was very stunned to see how well Jim Cummings did replacing Paul Winchel as the voice of Tigger - while still doing Pooh on top of it. The movie itself is wonderful and once again I stress that its perfect!
On DVD itself however, its a tad far from perfect. The Dolby Digital 5.1 mix is mostly front and center based with very very little activity on the rear channels at all - very disappointing considering the amount of things that could of been placed there. Another thing is Disney lied about the aspect ratio of the movie itself - on the box it states 1.66:1 (as that's the ratio its supposed to be) but anyone with enough knowledge of ratios can easily tell its 1.83:1. While I can understand Disney reframing the matting for viewing on HDTV, at least be honest to the public about what ratio it runs at.
Beyond those two complaints which is the main reason why I gave the movie only 4 out of 5 stars, the DVD is excellent. Picture is very clean as it should be for a very recent Disney film with no compression artifacts, dust, or edge enhancement noticed. The audio, despite not being a great surround mix, is very clear - sound effects are bright, dialog is very understandable, and the movie's music score and songs sound sweet on the DVD. Plus the extras on the disc are also nice - the Kenny Loggins video is very well done and is worth at least one viewing as the song fits wonderfully in with the films themes of family, not to mention a nice song all around.
Overall, The Tigger Movie is a wonderful movie and is great for Kids and T-I-DoubleGER-ERs of all ages!",970963200,,2019,4.301837270341207
1090643,4,6305942331,"I just watched this movie a few days ago and the only reason why I had to give it 4 stars as opposed to 5 was because the music was not up to par with other Disney flicks.  There was no song that you could keep on singing.  But overall, this was a great movie.  It was very touching and had good messages about the importance of having good friends and also being a good friend.  I really enjoyed this movie and as a Tigger fan it was great to hear Tigger sing the Tigger song.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.",970876800,,518,3.9902912621359223
1090644,5,6305942331,"As the movie begins, Tigger is looking for someone to bounce with.  No one  wants to bounce with him at all.  He asked Rabbit, Piglet, Poo, Eeyore, and  Kanga, but they just didn't want to bounce with him.  They all were getting  frustrated with Tigger, so they told him to go find someone like his self  to bounce with.  So Tigger set out to look for his family tree.  Tigger  went to bouncing, he bounced for days and days.  Not finding anything he  decided to write to his family.  So Tigger set down and wrote a letter to  his family.  He waited and waited for a reply but never got one.  So Roo  saw how upset Tigger was getting so he decided to get the group together  and write Tigger a letter.  They did, and signed it ""Your Family.""  Well  Tigger received this letter and thought that it was his actual family.  So  he planned a party.  Well when the group of friends found out that Tigger  was throwing a party they felt bad and decided to dress up as Tiggers too.  So they made the costumes and went to the party and started celebrating.  Everything was going well until Roo's mask came off and then Tigger found  out the truth.  Tigger then was real upset and he wanted to find his real  family.  So he set out again the next morning not realizing that there was  a big snowstorm ahead.  So the group of friends set out to look for Tigger.  When they found him, he was sitting up in a tree looking around.  When  they told him that he needed to come back home, he said ""NO!""  Being so  loud, his echo started and avalanche.  So Tigger ended up saving everybody  with his ""special bounce."" He then realized that everyone who came looking  for him was his real family; Rabbit, Poo, Eeyore, Owl, Kanga, Roo, and  Piglet.  Then they go back home and celebrate.  I recommend this movie for  anyone who likes Winnie the Pooh.",969235200,2,1831,4.3026706231454
1090645,5,6305942331,"A new opening takes us into the storybook where Pooh and his friends live, deep within the Hundred Acre Wood. Here, we find the usual gang, with the exception of Gopher (Why is it that in every Pooh movie after The Many Adventures, someone always has to be left out? Oh well, he's not in the book...), all voiced exceptionally well and mostly drawn with the original charm. Tigger is bouncing around, as usual, singing a longer version of his wonderful theme song, and the story begins.

  To sum it up, Tigger, who has always found pride in being ""the only one,"" is starting to feel some of the effects of being an endangered species. As far as he can see, there's no one in the 100 Acre Woods who shares his interests, which are mainly bouncing. All the while, Roo is constantly trying to show Tigger that HE is every bit as bouncy, but Tigger is soon obsessed with the idea of finding his tigger family. He searches through his treehouse, but finds nothing more than an empty locket. Roo suggests Tigger write a letter to his family, and when he does, Roo, Owl, Pooh, Eeyore, and Kanga write him a reply, signing it, ""Your Family."" Rabbit is too busy preparing for winter to get involved. But the plan to cheer Tigger up backfires immediately. When Tigger recieves his reply, he is suddenly convinced that his family is coming for a visit!

  Well, any more info would spoil the movie for you. Let's just say that it is a wonderful film in the spirit of the original Pooh movie. The only part that might not fit is a decidedly flashy and modern sequence where Tigger describes how his family might be. We see Tiggers in the roles of people such as Marilyn Monroe and Jerry Springer. True, that one scene is a bit odd to see in a Pooh movie, but this is in fact ""The TIGGER Movie,"" and Tigger himself IS a bit odd. Anyway, this sequence is soooo entertaining that I wouldn't think of suggesting that it be left out of the film! The music in ""The Tigger Movie"" was written by the legendary Sherman Brothers, so, of course, it is perfect. When I first saw this film, I was a bit uncomfortable with the modern sound of one of the songs as it played in the credits, but it is a beautiful song nonetheless, even if it was sort of reminiscent of some ""Savannah Smiles"" seventies type music. It really grows on you. By the way, for anyone who has said otherwise, this animation did NOT look like television quality! It was much better than that! Sure, it was less high tech than the usual stuff we see nowadays, but thank goodness in a Pooh movie! The story was handled very well, and the classic characters were honored far better than in ""Pooh's Grand Adventure: the Search for Christopher Robin."" That one wasn't horrible, but it shows how much better and more worthy of the big screen ""The Tigger Movie"" is. This film definitely belongs in everyone's DVD collection, and there are some nice extras on the DVD too. There are two games, the Kenny Loggins music video for the movie, and some other nice items. Nothing as overwhelming as the extras on the ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" DVD, but still nice. If you are a fan of Tigger or Pooh, pick up this movie! One of my favorite parts is when Pooh lulls the bees to sleep! Ha ha! Any Pooh movie is a great hot cocoa on a cold evening experience, especially if you have someone to cuddle with, and ""The Tigger Movie"" is no exception!",968803200,3,3391,4.4176
1090646,5,6305942331,"To start off, this is a really good movie, staring the one and ONLY  Tigger.  On a personal note, Tigger is one of my favorite cartoon  characters of all time.
The animation in this film is great.  The extreme  squash and stretch that Disney is famous for is all over this movie.  Very  nicely executed.
The movie starts off when Tigger starts to notice that  he really is the only Tigger.  He goes though some of his old junk at home  and finds a special locket.  Roo tells Tigger that he should write a letter  to his family, so Tigger does that and the story beings! All the characters  are featured in this film only Tigger is the main focus.

1090650,4,6305942331,"When I first heard this movie was coming out, my main question was why a theatrical release instead of direct-to-video? Many Disney sequels have  gone that route, including the last feature-length Winnie the Pooh film,  The Search for Christopher Robin.
The simple fact of the matter is  probably that Disney figured they could make more money with a theatrical  release (it came out with absolutely no competition for its intended  audience). Happily, it's also true that this movie was a step above the  usual direct-to-video fare. Most of the animation was uninspired (it's easy  to tell there are fewer frames per second than in major Disney theatrical  releases), but the scripts and voice acting were actually quite  good.
I've been a fan of the Winnie the Pooh stuff for what seems like  forever, so it's hard for me NOT to enjoy any of it. But the simple,  hearwarming story of Tigger's discovery of himself and how much his friends  really care about him just works. Sure, it's a childlike tale, but isn't  that the target audience? We're not looking for Citizen Kane when we turn  to Winnie the Pooh. We're looking for comfort and support to be who we are.  It's a great message for kids, and this movie does a great job of  presenting it.
I was a bit trepidatious when I saw that Jim Cummings (the  voice of Pooh in all but the original shorts) was taking over for Paul  Winchell as the voice of Tigger. Turns out that he does an unbelievable  Paul Winchell impression! Very impressive voice acting in this one --  really quite seamless.",964656000,22,1548,4.684014869888476
