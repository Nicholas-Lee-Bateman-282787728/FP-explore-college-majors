18854,4,0767850823,"This Jackie Chan-produced film is a wonderfully entertaining taste of the next generation of Hong Kong films.  This film has a very MTV feel to it, the way it fuses popular music, fashion and martial arts.  The script is forgettable, but who cares.  Even the fight scenes aren't as crisp as anything Chan would do, but, once again, who cares.  This movie is meant to be a one-and-a-half hour daydream,  and it works.  Highly recommended!",980380800,,437,4.76
18855,5,0767850823,"This movie is a success at what it attempts to be: a high-octane, bullet-riddled, stunts-galore, action-packed, youth-themed, glossy Hollywood-style bonanza.  We're talking skydiving scenes (never attempted in an HK film until now), detailed exploding miniatures, gun-fights on top of gun-fights, special effects, quick-cut filmmaking, and a cast of characters so huge it must have been a nightmare to coordinate them all.
I must say that this is a very ""Hollywood"" movie.  No great character development, no scenes of dramatic dialogue exposition, and no worries about recycling a few Woo cliches.  But it works!  It works perfectly!  Honestly, there is not a bad actor present in this film.  Despite the relative lack of depth in individual characters because of the multitudes of them, it really doesn't hinder the movie.  Remember that the 3 main leads are all relative newcomers to the acting world, so their performances are all the more impressive.
And if I took anything away from the behind-the-scenes special (included on the DVD, an appreciated and lengthy extra) it seemed like the cast and crew really gave this movie 110%.  The kids did most of their own stunts, and the special effects and skydiving scenes were handled by Americans with impressive credits to their name.  The dedication really shows through in the film, definitely a rock-solid, top-rank production all the way through.
The only reason I could see for not enjoying this is if you were expecting to see something deep in character development and pathos, like John Woo's The Killer.  Gen-X Cops is a glossy film, to be sure, and in that respect in does not disappoint.  Just don't go in expecting to see copious amounts of plot development, or magnificent stretches of oratory.  This is an action movie, albeit with much more gun sequences than real martial arts moves (another thing that might annoy devotees of the Jet Li school of Hong Kong cinema.)
But if you don't go in expecting Citizen Kane, and can let go enough to let the movie take you away in a hail of gunfire, then this is one of the best HK movies ever filmed.  Jackie Chan fans should be ecstatic.",979516800,,2146,4.927777777777778
18856,1,0767850823,"I'm a Jackie Chan generation (and I have all Jackie's movies).  I don't believe that Jackie Chan approved this movie.  Neither of his movies have foul language, nor too much innecessary violence.  If you want to see fighting, you are looking to the wrong movie.  Not even one interesting fight in the movie.  Only gunfighting.  If I want to see gunfighting I will rent an american movie (Stallone).  This movie is a Rambo want to be!!!!!!!  I really do not know if these kids really know any style of martial arts or what????  But the only fight takes place in the last five minutes of the movie and the duration of this fight is about two minutes.  And three good guys against one bad guy!!!!  Come on!!!  And they lost the fight.  The character named Aliens (bad hair day dude) wanted to be funny but he never made me laugh (Crappy humor).  Chan (the guy who recruited them) need it to be in a mental institution and not commanding a special forces unit.  There were only three things that stop me from killing myself after watching this movie:  1) Brad Allan was in the movie (cameo/stutman) for only 10 seconds 2) Jaymee Ong!!!!! (she is awesome)  and finally the Jackie Chan cameo and dialogue ""When I was younger, I was stronger and better than you"" (truth is out there).  Please only rent this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!",976579200,,1318,4.55982905982906
18857,4,0767850823,"I Really enjoyed this movie, I thought that it had some great action, perfect character interaction and some good humor. Most impotantly, I think that it is a really good introduction to some new hong Kong stars.
However, don't watch this movie expecting characters as involved as the ones in John Woo's a Better Tomorrow, because it is not that well developed. This movie is intended to be just for fun and I think it pulls that objective off great. You won't be disappointed if you purcahse this movie! Just don't compare it to John Woo's trio type movies.",976320000,,558,4.646464646464646
18858,4,0767850823,"for the most part, this movie was fun to watch. the only real problem i had with it was at times it had a little too much ""gen-x"" attitude. i guess it was made with young people in mind. the story deals with a group of 3 young undercover cops who ary trying to stop a japanese man from blowing up the hk convention center. the movie has the feel of big-budget summer entertainment to it. but, i think most people will enjoy it. the dvd version of this is packed with extras that warrents a purchase. watch the cantonese version instead of the english version",969926400,,558,4.273584905660377
18859,5,0767850823,"Absolutely awesome!  This is how I felt about ""Gen-XCops"".  A story about three rebellious generation-x cops hired toinfiltrate the underworld.  I recall several director's discussing about the current situation of HK films and how there is not enough originality and they tend to copy or redo something that was popular on many other films.
Gen-X Cops is different.  Police Academy this is not.  You get three talented young no-named actors who really kick ass in this film.  Notably Nicholas Tse who plays the character of Jack.  In the featurette included in the DVD, Jackie Chan even gives respect to the man because he also does his own stunts.  There is one scene where he comes out of a swimming pool with gasoline on top of the pool on fire and he emerges out of the pool.  These are just a few scenes that you see Nicholas Tse do.  Pretty boy?  This guy is not afraid to take on risks and this person is definitely a rising star to keep your eye on.
One of the things that makes this movie rock is the dedication of the director Benny Chan (Big Bullet, Who am I?). Although he admits that it was difficult to film the movie because the three gen-x actors loved to play around the set and are loud, he knew that was the chemistry that made these guys click and the way the movie turned out, he definitely clicked with them.
Sam Lee who plays the character of Alien is so weird and very funny, you can't help but like his character.  Then there is the ""playboy"" Stephen Fung who plays the character of Match.  According to Tse, a person playing himself...a playboy.  These guys get along so well and are a perfect click which makes this movie even more enjoyable.  One scene has the three friends outrunning blasts in a building.  A scene that they can only shoot once with no mistakes. The only time the three were ever quiet on the set according to Chan.
The movie also features our favorite gangster guy, Francis Ng who is a great gangster guy in movies such as ""Young and Dangerous"" and comedy movies such as ""Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Star"".  It was a pleasure to see him in this movie as Lok.
You'll notice that three languages are used in this movie (Btw, I watched it in Cantonese in English subtitles, I'm not into dubbed in English movies): Cantonese, English and Japanese.  The Japanese star in this film is Toru Nakamura.  Popular for his awesome work in Japanese dramas such as ""Nemureru Mori"" (The Sleeping Forest) and ""Ko-ri no Sekai"" (The Ice World).  He speaks in English and in Japanese in this movie but I think it was pretty cool they included him in this movie trying to attract Japanese viewers. In this movie he plays Akatora.  The bad guy!  For those who followed his works, he can definitely play a hardcore bad guy!  The man is definitely a talented actor.
It was also a pleasure to watch Grace Yip who plays Y2K and the introduction of model, Jaymee Ong (who plays the character, Haze) of Australia.  Last, you can watch the special cameo of martial arts star, Jackie Chan.
It also helps that you have people involved in this movie such as the special effects team that blew up the White House on Independence Day and a professional aerial team who worked with Chan to make one hell of a movie.
Some people might get upset about the use of English.  It's not the best and if you watch a Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Chow Yun Fat American movie, you are either used to it or your a person that moans about the English.  Just sit down and watch the movie without zoning in on the language, let the story and the action be the main thing you are watching this movie for.  I'm sure this movie was expensive to make as well and Gen-X Cops in my opinion has a much more of an interesting storyline.
I think one of the reason why I like this movie is because I can identify with the three actors and I like how hip this movie really is.
The video quality in the film is pretty good and I was happy top see the widescreen version done anamorphically! YES!  Also, the sound is presented in 5.1 (Cantonese and also in additional languages) and trust me, it was a great experience to hear those sounds from all sides of the room.
Are there many extras on this DVD?  At first, I quickly glanced at the menu before the movie and I said to myself...probably not.  I was wrong!  After enjoying the movie so much, I then checked out the extras included on the DVD.  Bare in mind it was 10:30 p.m. when I finished the movie.  It was cool to see the trailers but then I watched the deleted scenes and oh my!  It's about 40 minutes long?  Well, ok...it's mixed with parts of the film, so I guesstimate that it was 30 or so minutes of extra footage. Most movies with deleted scenes are about 5-10 minutes long or even shorter.  It was a pleasure to see the extra scenes.  Some I felt would have been nice for the movie but I wish there was a director's commentary to explain why he took it out...but what the heck, they jammed some scenes into this deleted scenes segment already.  Very cool to watch!
Now, it's almost 11:30, I have yet to watch the making-of documentary.  This one was pretty long and it was very...I mean VERY awesome!  You actually get to see Nicholas Tse perform those risky scenes and you also get to see/hear the comments by the director and by others of each other.  Also, a comment at the party by Jackie Chan who says something about Nicholas Tse.  Overall, the extras are pretty damn good!  To end the documentary, you get the music video performed by Tse, Fung and Lee.
It's almost 1 a.m. now and I'm just pumped up!  This movie was very awesome!  It was definitely much more than I expected.  Also, it is pretty cool to see a DVD out in department stores with Asians on the front cover.  I hope Media Asia Films releases another DVD and I can't wait for Gen-X Cops II.
This DVD is highly recommended for action movie viewers.",961891200,9,5859,4.392393320964749
18860,5,0767850823,"I don't know what the Editorial Reviewer was watchin', but th' original Cantonese Language track and English subtitles are present on th' disk. Viewers are urged to watch th' Cantonese track w/ subtitles as th' original  performances are top-notch, and alot of well-spoken English is present on  th' Cantonese track. Why? Because most of th' young stars featured in this  film were born/or grew up in the USA, Canada, or Australia! Thus, th'  original audio track features some well-spoken, non-butchered English  (unlike, say Jackie Chan's dubs) peppered betwixt th' Cantonese dialogue.  Th' plot, altho' not spectacular (action films..c'mon), is pretty tight and  follows a logical progression from beginning to end. Unlike Mod Squad, or  US cop flicks and shows, this cop flick takes place in HK so th' rules and  conventions are completely different making this all th' more enjoyable! In  other words, you won't find yourself picking nits which is VERY relaxing.
Asian actress/supermodel fans may want to keep their eyes peeled for hot  newcomer Jaymee Ong. Half Chinese and half Australian, Jaymee's hot sexy  looks accompanied by her lovely Aussie accent'll have you  exclaiming,""Tia Carrere, Michelle Yeoh, Sung Hi Lee, Who are  They! "" in a heartbeat. HK Comedy fans'll dig that Chinese Joe Pesci  guy who serves as th' group's mentor. Th' young stars of th' film are  fantastic; many of whom are featured in current HK hits like ""The  Purple Storm"", ""A Man Called Hero"" (also listed on  amazon.com), and ""2000 AD."" Heck, one guy looks like a Chinese  Matthew Lillard if you're into that guy...
Star Wars Episode II fans may  want to listen to the head Japanese badguy's well-spoken, sinister English.  If th' 20-something yr. old Japanese badboy Lucas supposedly hired to play  th' new Sith is as cool as th' young Japanese fellow in Gen-X cops, all  will be well in Star Wars-land. It's rare to see an Asian villain speaking  English with his own voice! 4.5 out of 5 Stars!",957398400,13,1984,4.978658536585366

18862,5,0767850823,"A great film. What the Mod Squad should have been. While high on flash and low on content, it is a blast to watch. Nic Tse and Stephen Fung are a joy to look at, and Sam Lee is hilarious. A cast of young, handsome and  talented actors, in a film that raises the bar for HK's new group of actors  and directors. New wave director Benny Chan does a great job with an  average plot, and, again, Stephen Fung and Nic Tse make it worth the price.  A must see for anyone exploring the always-changing arena of Hong Kong  films.",956620800,2,521,4.118811881188119
18883,4,0767850823,"""Gen X Cops"" isn't quite your average Hong Kong action movie, adopting instead the look of a low budget Hollywood summer flick.  A trio of young cops with an attitude tail gangsters all while looking pretty damn cool at it.  Jack (Nic Tse), Match (Stephen Fung), and Alien (alien-like Sam Lee) find themselves kicked out of police academy only to be picked up by Officer Chan (Eric Tsang), himself on the outs with his unsympathetic superiors.  Chan wants their help on a dangerous undercover mission, one involving gang bosses, gang betrayals, and rocket fuel (??)  They're joined by Y2K (Grace Yip) whose sole purpose it seems is to be the tough girl of the group.  Everyone's got a little something to prove and set out to get a little respect.  Balletic gunfights, questionable English, and the explosion of a Hong Kong landmark ensue.
The formulaic plot satisfies for the most part and makes sense in that action movie sort of way.  Nothing is too over-the-top, equaling harmless fun for all.  Clearly no one is taking themselves too seriously, and director Benny Chan was smart in throwing in a healthy dose of humor.  The end result is a slick, satisfying 1 1/2 hour reality break.
The cast consists mostly of young talents but the older actors turn in some scene stealing performances as well.  Francis Ng, who owns every role he takes, stands out as gang boss Lok.  He possesses an intensity that keeps his character believable without giving into parody.  (Beware Jackie Chan fans; he produced the movie and only appears for a one minute cameo at the end.)
The DVD extras won't disappoint either.  In addition to the Coming Attractions, the Special Features include cast and credit info, a production diary, a film magic sequence exhibiting storyboards and special effects, a Making Of, additional footage, and trailers and TV spots.  There are Cantonese and Mandarin language tracks with traditional, simplified, and English subtitles.  There is also a great in-depth commentary (w/ subtitles) from the cast and crew.  Unfortunately some of the special features do not have subtitles, though you won't miss much.  Another drawback is the overall sound quality of the Cantonese track, which is uneven at best.",1064448000,5,2219,4.970189701897019

18886,5,0767850823,"I read some reviews not knowing whether to watch this movie or not. There were some positive reviews, and then there were some negative ones. On my thirteenth birthday, I was at the store buying this.
The movie looked really cool, with an interesting cast and some great action sequences. I know the girls will go crazy over Nicholas Tse and Stephen Fung, my cousin thinks they're real cute. I had never seen a movie like this. It was hip, humorous, and like I said the action was awesome.
The dubbing matches the actors quite well if you ask me. When you listen to their dubbed voices, it sounds as if it could actually almost be them. In the Cantonese/Mandarin version there is some English being spoken.
The special features are awesome also, including a music video, a making of-featurette, and some awesome trailers.
Overall, this movie is great. I think that a little over 10 bucks isn't enough to charge for a movie like this. Do not bother renting this movie. Just buy it. It's awesome. By the way, if you like this one, there is an internationaly made sequal titled Gen-Y Cops. I know, the name is kind of corny but at the same time makes sense. Anyway, that one is even better.

does the plot seem whack and out of this world?? thankfully, Benny Chan is the director so you know you can expect a lot of fun/actions. Stephen Fung speaks english really well. And Nicholas Tse was very good in this movie. Not as good as in Y&D;Prequel but he had his moments. Sam lee is just hilarious as Alien.

18889,4,0767850823,"This movie was surprisingly good.  It caught me off guard.  For a movie of it's type (young, angry, foul mouthed guys running around trying to shoot and stop the bad guys) it has some character, plot and (gasp) heart.  Wow.  It is mainly in Chinese, but has Japanese charaters and actors speaking Japanese.  And whenever Cinese and Japanese converse, the dialogue switches over to English (Akatora's accent is SO cool).  Or, if you want, you can watch it dubbed in English where the Chinese is changed to English, but the Japanese is in Japanese (confused?).  If you want to know what the Japanese are saying and you don't speak the language, you'll need the subtitles turned on.  It's kinda funny seeing when they don't dub Inspector To when he says one line in English.  The music is a little stereotypical and repeatative, but still pretty good.  It's over all a great movie.  I just suggest that you watch it in the Chinese with subtitles.",1003449600,2,943,4.689024390243903
18890,2,0767850823,"Okay:  plot - incomprehensible and stupid;  dialogue - trite, hackneyed, inexplicably often in English and not always terribly good English (why can't they just use Cantonese or Japanese for goodness' sakes?), in particular Akatora;  special effects - really quite cheap, the much-vaunted HK$30m is only 3m, after all; incidental music - EVERY time there is a badly scripted romantic clinch between Stephen Fung and Jaymee Ong (an underdeveloped, badly acted and unconvincing plot line if ever there was one) you get a high pitched guitar instrumental which is incredibly CLICHD: just stop it, all right?
It is only worth watching for a comedy turn as a SWAT commander by HK movie expert Bey Logan.  However, we can be thankful that the film was at least dubbed into Cantonese with full lip-synch as opposed to the more regular half a minute out dialogue.  Don't even think about risking the English dubbed version.
In the end, the only Generation-X hero worth watching is the remarkably young Jet Li in Once Upon a Time in China 1 & 2.  Which are both runaway five-star efforts.",995587200,2,1079,4.9010989010989015
18891,4,0767850823,"It surprised me, but I liked it!  I put off getting this DVD because I had been disappointed before with HK action movies.  Grim, brutal and usually ending in a bloodbath of some sort, with low production qualities and nil storyline in some cases, or just very hard to follow!  However, this one is really good. though it was a bit confusing to follow at first.  But I am really getting tired of Hollywood movies - they all seem the same to me with their jazzed up special effects at the expense of the story.  This movie had SFX but not too much.  I liked the young actors and hope to see more of them in future.  Sam Lee was especially funny and I suppose the ""teeny-boppers"" will sigh over Nick Tse and Steven Fung.  Eric Tsang was as zany as usual (I have seen him before in comedies).  But the moody Japanese villian Akatora almost stole the show.  You almost felt sorry for him in the end. Another surprise was the tense undercurrent between Jack and Lok (the Chinese villian).  They seemed to almost be friends, Lok even saving Jack's life!  Loved the cameo by Jackie Chan at the end.

7789089,5,0767850823,"I watched this one a few years back and still own it on DVD along with the sequel Gen Y Cops.

I primarily bought this as Stephen Fung and Nicholas Tse were in it after seeing them together in the film 2002.  I then saw this movie of them together and decided to buy Gen x Cops on DVD.

This is a fun movie to watch and there is really no need for subtitles half the movie is in English anyway. I know most of it is in Cantonese, a little Japanese, but the majority is English.

The cast line is excellent with most of the big stars in hong kong securing fantastic characters within the story, stars such as , Toru Nakamura, Francis Ng, Sam Lee, Daniel Wu,  Eric Tsang and Terrence Yin

If you love Hong Kong action movies with lots of fight sequences then you will love this movie as it has it all.  Comedy, a little romance and the dumb witty Tsang at his best.  Why does he always get cast as the stereotypical clown I wonder.  But needless to say he plays it well.

Tse and Fung are like the hong kong version of Ant and Dec, they always seem to pop up in the same movie.  I can name at least 8.  But these 2 are meant to be together they make a fantastic acting pair.

They play a pair of rookie cops who team up with the annoying Sam Lee and Grace Yip to fight a crime organization  by any means possible.

The antics and the obstacles they come across are both laughable and serious.

One scene sticks in my head from the entire movie is a scene when Sam Lee is being given wording from Grace Yip in order to make conversation in Japanese to distract the Japanese guard resulting in insulting the Guards mother, poor Lee is beaten thus providing the distraction they need, Now that was funny.

The whole movie brings about the aspect that not all Hong Kong movies are all about Kicking butt in the old fashioned way of Martial Arts movies.  Hong kong can do serious comedies too you know, and this movie provides it.

If you are looking for a laugh this will bring a tear to your eye in a laughable way.

Its fun to watch and well worth checking out more films by Tse and Fung.

I'd give this movie a rating of 9 out of Ten  for comedy

10 out of 10 for the acting talents from Nicholas Tse, Stephen Fung and Tor Nakamura",1128816000,,2228,4.1183294663573085

Eric Tsang Chi-wai reminds me why I should hate the idiot, despite his good acting on Infernal Affairs. The guy is a moron and this movie is moronic.

NOTHING makes sense whatsoever and everything looks staged and fake. I like action but this movie was just plain DUMB because the dialogue was retarded and nothing was believable.

Please save your money and watch something else instead.",1105833600,,562,4.554455445544554

Jackie Chan co-produced this routine blockbuster as a showcase for some of Hong Kong's hottest new teen stars, including Nicholas Tse Ting-fung, Stephen Fung Tak-lun, Daniel Wu Yin-cho and comic relief Sam Lee Chan-sam. The convoluted storyline posits Tse, Fung and Lee as a trio of rebellious young cops, recruited as undercover agents by police commander Eric Tsang Chi-wai to investigate the shady business dealings between low-level Triad underling Wu and a Japanese crime lord (Toru Nakamura) who has seized a shipment of deadly explosives for nefarious purposes, prompting a sequence of betrayals and counter-betrayals amongst members of the opposing criminal factions, until events reach an explosive climax during a showdown at the newly-opened Hong Kong Convention Center.

Veteran director Benny Chan Muk-sing (A MOMENT OF ROMANCE, NEW POLICE STORY) marshals proceedings into a cohesive whole, though the movie fizzles badly after a dynamic opening sequence before rallying again somewhere around the halfway mark. The action scenes are staged and executed with all the breathless abandon one expects from HK cinema, but many of them unfold so quickly, it's often difficult to know who's doing what to whom, or even why, and crucial plot points are sometimes lost along the way. Few of the actors emerge with any credit, though Nakamura is admirably solemn as an English-speaking Japanese villain who clings to old-fashioned notions of truth and righteousness in a world where such virtues no longer have currency. The young leads are OK (Wu's transition from beleaguered second-in-command to ruthless hard man is surprisingly convincing), while Tsang spends much of his screen time trading insults with his younger, slicker police counterpart (Moses Chan Ho).

Stand-out set-pieces include a breathtaking skydive from the roof of a high-rise building, and the climactic scenes at the Hong Kong Convention Center which utilize ambitious visual effects supervised by a US effects team, headed by Oscar-winner Joe Viskocil (INDEPENDENCE DAY, APOLLO 13). Sensitive viewers may be irritated by some xenophobic comments directed toward the Japanese villains, and there's a couple of dialogue exchanges which play directly to bigoted attitudes about gay men, but the offence is fleeting, if unnecessary. Ultimately, this big budget fluff - designed to compete with a flood of Hollywood blockbusters dominating the HK box-office - amounts to little more than a feel-good fantasy thriller, as slick and hollow as the very films it seeks to emulate. A huge success on its home turf, the film spawned an inevitable sequel, GEN-Y COPS (2000).",1089158400,3,2767,5.425581395348837
