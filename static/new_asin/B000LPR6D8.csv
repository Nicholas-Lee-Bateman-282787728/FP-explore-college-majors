2712072,4,B000LPR6D8,"This is a recording of a 2001 concert by John P. Kee and The New Life Community Choir, filmed in North Carolina.  Kee's voice is in fine form and receives heavenly support from the choir on such familiar songs as ""I Do Worship,"" ""My Healing,"" ""I Believe,"" and ""Jesus.""  The accompanying band, including Kee's own son on drums, is a group of highly skilled musicians and provide outstanding backup.

Guests on the concert include the legendary Shirley Caesar and contemporary artist Tonex.

At over an hour, the DVD is engaging and entertaining throughout.  Especially inspirational is the concept video of ""The Wedding Song,"" featuring a not-so-young couple dating and ultimately getting married.

The only downside is the editing and matching of the audio and video.  During one song, it appears that the soloist performing had her vocal added later, making her a tad out of sync.  There is another instance where Kee is singing lead but in a split second an elderly man appears from out of nowhere, taking the reins of the song.

Thus, the DVD loses a star.",1183075200,,1059,4.838888888888889
2712073,5,B000LPR6D8,"This video was a perfect example of how a Gospel concert should be. ""Not Guilty"" is now my favorite Gospel concert to watch for insperation John P. Kee is a masterful minister of music who appreciate's the shear texture of music and also understands the importence of excellence in the offering of music up to GOD.

I have given copies of this video to family members and friends, I neglected to keep a copy for myself so I am going to order a new copy from ""AMAZON.COM"" and continue to injoy the blessings of GOD with Pastor Kee and New Life. I am from mobile ALABAMA and I am a college student majoring in Computer Science, but my first and true love is music specifictly the Piano, so when I hear a great Compositions such as the ones I hear on this video I am overwhelmed with joy and inspiration. Thank You Pastor kee for this glimpse of musical perfection.",1145923200,,862,4.3875
