4719291,5,B005L399BW,"I commend VCI for again making available a set of films that are not otherwise easily available.
I was familiar with all the films except Sea of Sand, and I found this film to be quite entertaining, but it may be a little weaker overall when compared to the others.  Some of the characters portrayed in this film come across as underdeveloped.  The other 3 films are all well done.  The Way to the Stars has the somewhat rarified position as being a relatively early example of British and US wartime ties.  At the time the film was made it was still necessary to show ""We're all in this together"" and thus thornier if more realistic problems are glossed over.
Above Us the Waves and The Malta Story tell how two lesser-known aspects of the war developed, and they certainly kept my attention.
The DVD quality was quite good--no problems as far as I'm concerned.  The set is a bargain, and well worth it for a serious film viewer, as well as for those war film lovers who don't mind a different perspective.
One suggestion:  VCI, please try to find and then make available an uncut version of The Way Ahead--and pair it with the shorter US version, The Immortal Battalion.",1327363200,33,1172,4.530805687203792

4719301,5,B005L399BW,"This review will require an update in due course, as I've only watched two of the four movies to date (""The Way to the Stars,"" and ""The Malta Story""; the others in the set are ""Above Us The Waves"" and ""Sea of Sand"").

But if these are representative of the entire set, then you're in for a treat.  What's particularly noteworthy is the sense of realism (including genuine footage in some cases, such as the Malta Story) and well-acted performances (and impressive casts).  Neither of the two films I've seen is ""over the top"" in their presentation, and while there are romantic aspects to both, these do nothing to detract from the quality of the broader stories told.  If you've seen (or own) other British films along the lines of ""In Which We Serve,"" ""The Cruel Sea,"" or ""The Battle of Britain,"" then these make fine additions to your collection.",1359676800,13,849,4.64

8477343,4,B005L399BW,"These are very patriotic movies from our British friends during WWII.  My favorite of the 4 is ""The Way to the Stars,"" which was excellent and touched my heart.  Next favorite was ""Above Us the Waves,"" which features some very unique footage of Royal Navy Submarines post-WII.  Suspenseful, well-acted, and a true story.  Next down the list is ""The Malta Story.""  A young Alec Guinness is very good and you will learn things about the fight for Malta you never new.  Last ranked comes ""Sea of Sand.""  I rank this one last because, not clear from the billing, is that Richard Attenborough plays a drunk, lazy sergeant.  However, the acting job done by his commander, John Gregson, is top notch.  You get the predictable few post-WWII surplus vehicles chasing each other around the Arizona desert (or whatever movie lot the Brits used here), but it is still nevertheless not bad.  So for $25 for these four movies, yes, still beats anything you'll find at today's box office for, what is the cost of movies today, $20 each?",1418515200,4,1021,4.7175141242937855
