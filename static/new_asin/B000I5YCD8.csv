2653302,4,B000I5YCD8,"AFTER THE RAIN, made in 1999, has only recently been released on DVD.  It is most welcome to the library on the examination of human rights as they come into conflict in Africa.  Ross Kettle, who based the film on his play 'Soweto's Burning' and directed this cinematic version, achieves more insights into the racial conflagrations as focused on three people than most of the most major films released on the subject.

The film opens when the main characters were children and caught up in the marked division between whites and blacks that interfered with their childhood games and friendships because of the cruel prejudices imposed by their parents. In 1972 Steph (Paul Bettany) a conflicted Afrikaans soldier, is in love with Emma (Louise Lombard), a dancer for the theater.  Steph is due to depart with his brigade and spends his final nights with Emma: Emma promises to wait for him, pleading with Steph to come back alive.  Steph leaves and Emma returns to her job, a theater where the lighting manager is a black man Joseph (Ariyon Bakare).  One evening Joseph aids Emma with her car and Emma in turn offers Joseph refuge: Joseph is without a place to stay except in the streets.  The fact that a white woman and a black man even talk is dangerous and it is with great hesitation that Joseph accepts Emma's kindness.  Gradually the two become true friends, able to dissolve the disparity that is destroying the nation.  But when Emma finally and innocently offers Joseph to sleep in her bed instead of on the floor, the crisis occurs: Steph has deserted the army and returns home to Emma's flat and finds the two in bed: he thinks the worst and becomes enraged.

The bulk of the film is the enclosed argument and confrontation among the three young people, facing all of the ugliness and prejudice that crippled South Africa.  When the three are at the peak of being threatened by the conflict, Emma is accidentally shot and the manner in which Steph and Joseph face this with its touching outcome makes this an indelible memory for the viewer.

The cast includes some very fine South African actors who allow us to see the stances of each side of the sociopolitical line.  But it is the powerful performances by Louise Lombard, Paul Bettany and Ariyon Bakare that make this film ignite.  It is to the credit of Ross Kettle to make the history of the struggle so potent by using significant flashbacks to the characters' childhood dilemmas and the spare use of external shots that make the tension and moments of quiet acceptance so pertinent.  A major problem with the DVD, however, is the lack of subtitles, a factor that prevents us from understanding the varying accents with which the general public is not familiar.  But that is a small defect in an otherwise very fine film.  Grady Harp, December 06",1167177600,20,2815,4.723926380368098
2653303,5,B000I5YCD8,"Though this movie was a bit dark and woeful, I couldn't stop watching. The deep emotional struggles brought to the surface left me in tears. A young South African white man played by the talented Paul Bettany is torn between his loyalty to gentle memories of childhood friendships with blacks and his mother's paranoid, bitter ideals that he must one day 'protect them' from the blacks before they 'take over' everything the whites have built. When his girlfriend Emma develops an innocent friendship with a talented young black man, Joseph (Ariyon Bakare) she meets at work, things become even more tangled. This story is poetic and heart-breaking at the same time with fantastic performances.

2653305,4,B000I5YCD8,"Dramatic story that takes place during some of the final years of Apartheid in South Africa, when it was illegal to have a black person inside your home for more then domestic duties or chores. The story shows how Apartheid made both blacks and whites prisoners of an archaic system...crushing innocence in it's wake and destroying lives.",1430092800,,338,4.947368421052632

2653308,4,B000I5YCD8,"This movie about  South Africa gives an overview from 1972 to 1999. It reveals the great tragedy of  apartheid,  and solving problems after it ends. It finally takes a terrible tragedy to force an end to the conflicts between the people in this story. Very powerful acting.",1428019200,2,273,4.76595744680851

2653313,4,B000I5YCD8,"This is a wonderful movie for so many reasons, but sort of slow starting for being 12 Angry Men-esque.

The movie reinforces a perhaps ironic, but common notion  that white South Africans, specifically Boers/Afrikaners tend to be more open to dialogue regarding the sensitive matters surrounding imperialism, racism, apartheid and the post-apartheid era in a way that likely will never come to fruition in the West.

The love interest who clearly identifies as of British heritage is relevant, and a fairly typical portrayal of the British mindset on South African politics,  regardless of reality.

After the Rain ultimately focuses on the inherent challenges of upholding a regime driven by the fear of relinquishing the sweeping privileges provided by apartheid and how that fear and hate imprisoned whites as well.",1403395200,2,818,5.310077519379845

8144121,4,B000I5YCD8,"This is an important film as it depicts the abhorrent influence of racism,  as expressed in apartheid,  on the mind of a child. That white boy, frightened and degraded by his mother for associating with black children, evolves into a tormented confused adult, in a horrendous double bind of loathing and twistedly protecting his black counterparts. He becomes a bona fide abuser of the worthy woman he has ostensibly loved and her friend, a constant, principled black man. The outcome will be revealed in the viewing. Worth a hard look.",1464393600,,536,4.944444444444445

8144125,5,B000I5YCD8,"A beautiful film.  It is a comment on enduring racism that the cover shows two characters, both European South Africans, and not the third and in many ways most important character, who is a Black South African.  There is tenderness, violence, heartbreak, and healing in this film.  Call it idealistic, but it addresses the enduring nobility of the human spirit.  Wake up!",1454976000,,372,4.951612903225806
8144126,5,B000I5YCD8,"Without giving away the plot, I would say that this film demonstrates how mistrust and hatred are taught.  As adults, we have to wrestle with our own conscience as to what is right and wrong.  Human beings subjugating one another is wrong.  The acting in this film was superb and the conclusion brought one to tears, yet hope that there could be a better world.  What bothers me about this film is that the promotional cover shows only two white faces.  What?  Didn't anybody learn anything of substance from this story/film?  Ariyon Bakare gave a stellar performance showing the restraint practiced by one under subjugation and the sensitivity of forgiveness.",1454630400,,660,4.945454545454545
