8404308,5,B003SG8122,I got this for my mom who likes the paranormal related discs. I chose this as it is a good set of episodes.,1396915200,4,107,3.6956521739130435
8404309,5,B003SG8122,"Good honest paranormal story telling,
I've watched this DVD several times.
It tells of true life events, from paranormal investigators to strange events which are happening to normal families, who want answers.
The re-enactments were well acted and believable.
Give it a go! Keep an open mind.",1320969600,6,293,5.25531914893617
8404310,2,B003SG8122,"The cover is scary enough and looked like some scary haunting stories but it was actually a mixture of differenct types of programs. I did not like the first episode ""Ghost Lab"", which like many others trying to be like the ""Paranormal State"".
Some stories were re creation from the real story, but combination of this and the paranormal hunting episodes were simply mis match.
I have to be careful next time, to read the reviews and contents before I purchase to avoid getting what I am not completely satisfied with.",1301270400,17,518,4.7032967032967035
