8508549,5,B0071NV3E6,"I first saw ""Living in Light"" as part of a large group of about 300 people, so I got to experience it personally as well as in that environment.  Bottom line: I really liked it a lot and so did all the people I talked to afterwards.  Why?  Well first of all, the people in it - Neale Donald Walsch, Alan Cohen, Panache Desai, etc. are all people I greatly respected beforehand.  Simply put, they walk like they talk.  Something felt genuine about it.  Secondly, the message was timely and very positive.  The speakers were optimistic about the potential of our future in a very pragmatic way and that was so encouraging - it helped me find a really positive mindset.  A third aspect was that there were actually some NEW INSIGHTS offered, lol. There's something either Mirabai Devi or Gangaji said that compared a new spiritual awakening to a seedling and how it has to be sheltered and nurtured to give it time to grow (or something along those lines), and I'd never thought of it quite in those terms.  And finally, I appreciated the fact that it was a pretty universal message that could be appreciated by many people in different walks of life.  There was humor, beautiful scenes of my dear Hawaii and other really good stuff.  It's also something you have to watch a few times to really absorb the messages, so I highly recommend getting the DVD.",1331942400,5,1351,4.541322314049586
