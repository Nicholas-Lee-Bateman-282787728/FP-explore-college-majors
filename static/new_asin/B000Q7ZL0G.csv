I bought 6 different videos of bounce dvds and its all with lame singing! Trust me this is not worth buying",1486684800,,256,4.468085106382978
8195047,5,B000Q7ZL0G,"Very satisfied with this DVD. Had been looking for this for quite a while. These
dvds are hard to find. My granddaughter loves it.",1396137600,,130,4.458333333333333
8195048,5,B000Q7ZL0G,"My son has sensory issues. This dvd was magic, he loved it, wants to watch it over and over again. It's like social stories in a dvd with songs. Highly recommended.",1391731200,,164,4.32258064516129
8195049,5,B000Q7ZL0G,"I got this for my son who's had a few developmental delays. These DVD really helped him.

My favorite part is the safety song which sings about not running in the street, and not going near the water without an adult's consent. My son used to have no fear of water (ugh!) but now he stays a few feet from the edge. Hurray!

My son loves the DVDs, but even more so, often requests the bonus CDs that come with it. They make him very happy when we listen to them in the car.

I think these DVDs are targeted towards children on the Autism Spectrum, but honestly, ALL children could benefit from this music learning.",1253145600,2,613,4.267241379310345
8195050,5,B000Q7ZL0G,"Bounce helped save my sanity! This is the only kids program that my daughter will actually watch from start to finish.  It is extremely helpful around dinner time.  And she learns from it every time she watches. I bought one for a friends baby on his 1st birthday.  I was not sure if he would love it as much as my baby, but he does.  It helps her get dinner ready to.  She said she owes me her 2nd born now.  The videos are great for kids.",1242345600,,440,4.0
8195051,5,B000Q7ZL0G,My 3 year old son was just diagnosed with Autism. My mother bought him the Bounce dvds and he just loves them. He has only watched them a few times and he is singing the songs throughout the day without being prompted. The music is simple and not annoying and the whole dvd holds his attention very well. I really think that these are a wonderful source of therapy because of the music and the way they word the songs! This comes HIGHLY recommended and if I could give it more stars I would!!!,1238112000,,493,4.25531914893617
8195052,5,B000Q7ZL0G,"My child is not even on the spectrum, but the Bounce DVDs are a huge hit in our house.  Elizabeth's songs are fantastic -- they don't drive you nuts like other kid-tunes.  And the themes of all the DVDs teach coping skills and behaviors that can benefit ALL children.  It is so nice to see a DVD like this that actually uses REAL kids rather than wall-to-wall cartoons and none of that strange, psychedelic animation that seems to be the trend.  If your child is a late talker, or just shy, or just likes great music to jump around to, then the Bounce DVDs are the best that money can buy.  How many ways can I praise this series?  Can I give it more stars than five?  And when on earth are they going to add more episodes??  Kids and parents are waiting...",1222387200,,757,4.244755244755245
8195053,5,B000Q7ZL0G,"This DVD is one I would recommend heartily for parents of young children on the autism spectrum. I would have loved to have had this when our daughter was first diagnosed and we were learning how to help her go with us to the store,playground etc.
  The DVD handles going to the store, broken down into seperate tasks like:finding a parking space ,helping shop for healthy food,there is also a way to ask for a break if you get tired or too excited.
  This DVD also covers birthday parties and the doctor's office. Either of which can make grown ups cringe at the thought of attempting with a child who has autism.",1210982400,3,614,4.455357142857143
8195054,5,B000Q7ZL0G,"Elizabeth Balzano is an educated, amazing music therapist!  Her program is excellent.  My son LOVES Ballou and has a wonderful time interacting with the Spectrum Connection/Bounce Series.  Children learn excellent communication and safety skills!  Whether your child struggles with developmental delays or has a typically developing brain - they will BENEFIT from this series.  Parents - YOU will benefit from the wonderful ""Tips: Advice"" special features.  Bravo!!  Brava!  to the whole team - including Brandissmo!! & Sprout!  This is a MUST HAVE item - the WHOLE series!",1200182400,4,573,5.494252873563219
8195055,5,B000Q7ZL0G,"I've worked in educational television for 3 decades, and in that time seen an evolution from Sesame Street & Mr. Rogers through TeleTubbies, Blues Clues and beyond.

But with the BOUNCE series of DVDs, a new standard is being set.

Ostensibly created for viewing by families with autistic children, I found the series charming, engaging and appropriate viewing for any child/family experiencing the challenges of new and potentially difficult, frightening or overwhelming experiences such as visiting the doctor's office, or meeting new kids at the playground.

Host Elizabeth Balzano is riveting and magical when she sings to the circle of children, and the children themselves - the group loosely resembles a pre-school or early secondary class - are totally adorable, and the child viewer will easily relate to them!

This DVD comes with a 7 song bonus CD, but would be a bargain even without.

I can't recommend this series highly enough!",1195689600,7,942,5.171052631578948
