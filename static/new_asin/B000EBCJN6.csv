2512042,5,B000EBCJN6,"After a disappointing 4th season, i wanted to continue watching because i owed it to the series some of the best seasons on tv ever, so i didn't get my hopes up much, i didn't even think there would be a creative attack, plot or anything...

I was dead wrong.

This season opened with an unbelievable first episode that blew me away, and the suspense stayed all way. Now, i have watched every season, i have watched alias, i have watched lost,blablabla..i have come to learn to predict and expect most of the twist and turns here and there along the plot. This time, they caught be my surprise every time. It is simply incredible! This season presents a complete new chapter for jack bauer. It regained all its glory from season 2 a few blocks back, and it kept going. Since the story is one of the main elements of the series, i will do my best not to reveal any of it

Here are just a few of the pros of this season:

A complicated plan and intentions from the bad guys pulling all the strings, totally passing the mediocre plot of ""Kill americans and that's it"" from season 4

A terrefic episode featuring a brief but great apperance by jack's daughter

Old and new characters mixing well together

Mind blowing plot twists that made my jaw drop to the floor. It is simply great, as you watch, the show totally transmits every feeling necessary to make these episodes keep you glued to your seat every week.

A clif hanger that leaves you wanting for the begginning of the 6th season.

Great acting from the cast, martha, jack, karen, secretary heller, everyone...

Overall, they totally deserved this emmy. The show had a message in other seasons: If things are bad, don't worry, they can always get worse (well, in the 4th season it was the opposite, but no matter).

This season is ground breaking, 5 Stars, 2 thumbs way up, outstanding. Watch it or buy it, you won't regret it",1158019200,25,1883,4.476608187134503
2512043,5,B000EBCJN6,"Definitely the most exciting season so far - after a rather disappointing 4th season with a new threat every 3 episodes. Season 5 is the only one that manages to keep the suspense and the excitement with a single threat.
The Emmy is well deserved, and the fact that it comes during the fifth year only proves the originality and imagination of the show. 24 is a UFO in American TV, but it is also hands down the most addicting, most enthralling show ever (sorry for Lost, but come on, there can be more twists and suspense in one episode of 24 than in an entire season of Lost).",1158019200,68,578,4.3119266055045875

2512047,2,B000EBCJN6,"Memorable deaths and scenes, high tension and suspense.
Good parts with Aaron, President Logan, Mrs. Logan, and Jack.
Kim is just a horrible character, should have been killed off in Season 1.
Tony and Audrey got downgraded.
Rachel was good. ;-)
Russian villains sucked. Chirstopher was a good foil for Jack but he wasn't the big boss.
Still no reason why Mike would be the chief of staff.
Too many episodes were fillers. Main conspiracy dragged.
CTU/Homeland getting worse and worse, even though Bill and Chloe are there.
Impossible to happen on one day. The assassination of the first black prez would have been the only news, and would have preempted the dumb Russian treaty,
The spies, betrayals, bureaucracy, and immunities are very old.",1495670400,,742,4.991935483870968

2512062,5,B000EBCJN6,"We are really enjoying Season 5 of ""24""! I'm not sure why we didn't watch the series when it was originally on but we certainly are enjoying it now. Kiefer Sutherland is excellent in the lead role & each show is so suspenseful it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I really like that we can watch 2 or 3 episodes at a time if we want, since I can't imagine having to wait a week between episodes. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone especially if you like a good story with lots of action.",1486598400,,492,4.082474226804123

2512071,5,B000EBCJN6,"The Fox Network series entitled ""24"" is a post-9/11 counter-terrorism television program, which premiered in November, 2001, just two months after the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. This fifth season examines another 24-hour time period in the hectic life of Federal Agent Jack Bauer of the Los Angeles branch of the Counter-Terrorism Unit, known as the CTU, as he battles frantically to thwart yet another diabolical conspiracy. The novel structure of this groundbreaking television series involves each episode representing a single hour in this very action-packed and challenging day. The character of Agent Jack Bauer is portrayed perfectly by actor Kiefer Sutherland, who plays an old-fashioned tough guy, who utilizes any means necessary to vanquish the forces of evil. Of course, the rather aggressive and sometimes brutal methods of Agent Bauer often blur the distinction between good and evil. This fifth season of ""24"" continues to be decidedly intelligent, fast-paced, and suspenseful, and it is a superb combination of the political thriller and action/adventure genres. Its use of real-time plot development, and the innovative split-screen technique, are absolutely brilliant. The riveting intrigue and captivating plot twists keep the viewer totally enthralled, because one never really knows who can be trusted. This outstanding Counter-Terrorism series ""24"" is truly my all-time favorite television program, and I enthusiastically give its fifth season a five-star rating, along with my very highest recommendation!",1486252800,3,1556,5.740259740259741

2512190,3,B000EBCJN6,"After reading the reviews I was hopeful something new would emerge from this series, however, that didn't happen. Seasons 1 and 2 were awesome and at this point I'd say it's because 24 was definitely expanding the concept for television dramas. By season 4 it got old, other than names and the particular terrorist threat, it's the same 'ol same 'ol. I struggled through season 5 hoping for something, ANYTHING to change but it didn't. Quit after 2 episodes of season 6. Just can't bear it, I can predict the dialogue and the twists before they occur. Oh well.... Happens to the best concepts I guess.",1483315200,,601,4.679245283018868

After watching the new series, Designated Survivor, I decided I had to check out 24  and my only regret is that it has taken this long.  I have been binge watching ever since.  What a fantastic actor, great story lines, and tremendous cast.  The talent on this show is remarkable but from the opening scenes of season 5 you are asking yourself, ""what just happened?"".  As is true 24 style, the events that take place is episode 1 just set the stage for the multiple twists and changes that take place over the remaining episodes.  Just when you think you have it figured out...not so much!  That is what I love about this show and especially season 5.",1482710400,,718,4.345864661654136

Kiefer Sutherland is a great action-hero and the supporting cast members are excellent.  Further, I like the fast-paced action that jumps from one action setting to another.  Finally, I like to see justice prevail, even if Jack has to take some initiative and risks to make it happen in the typical non-supportive bureaucratic environment in which he operates, which mirrors our current government's failure to enforce laws to nail the bad guys.",1473984000,,554,4.739583333333333

2512600,3,B000EBCJN6,The show was entertaining but nothing much changes in 24. The characters change personalities from episode to episode and it is hard to relate to them. The plots are sometimes ludicrous as the villains seem to have magical powers that allow them to disappear at will while the bumbling response teams are mowed down or blown up by armies of enemy soldiers backed up by black helicopters. I would like to have given the series a 4 or 5 but the writing is pretty weak.,1473552000,,466,4.4941176470588236

2512638,5,B000EBCJN6,"Season Four ended on a total shocker that no one could have ever seen coming. Season Five is even better, ratcheting up the personal and emotional stakes higher than ever. The first fifteen to twenty minutes of the season premiere are some of the most intense moments ever on the show. The Season Five prequel on the bonus disc of Season Four sets it all up quite nicely. There are plenty of surprises in store this season, including a heartbreaking end to a story arc begun in Season One, and continued to the end of Season Three. The acting is as always top-notch, and everything is of the highest quality.

SPOILER ALERT!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!There were at least two plotlines that I felt were left unresolved, probably as a hook for Season Six, but it would have been nice to see them resolved either in the body of the show itself or as deleted/extended scenes. Those two plotlines are: The unaltered recording of the telephone conversation that First Lady Martha Logan and President David Palmer had. What did he really say before Walt Cummings altered it? Second, what happened to Evelyn Martin and her daughter? Yes, Christopher Henderson said that she gave Jack's location up, but what did he do to them? Did he murder them or let them live? I recently ordered Season Six, so please do NOT comment on what happens in that season. END SPOILER ALERT!!!! END SPOILER ALERT!!!! END SPOILER ALERT!!!! END SPOILER ALERT!!!! END SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!! END SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!

The cream of the special features, in my opinion, is the deleted/extended scenes. Plotlines that are unresolved in the show itself may turn out to be resolved in these scenes, and it is always interesting to see what was cut out of the episodes and why. Perhaps the viewers have a different opinion than the producers, editors and directors who work on the show regarding their rationale for eliminating the scenes either in whole or in part. The Supporting Players featurette was very interesting; however, it would have been nice if Reiko Aylesworth, who played Michelle Dessler from Season Two through Season Five, had been suffered to be interviewed for this piece. It was fun learning about the surprising side jobs of the actors on the show. Even though this was for the supporting cast, it would have also been interesting to hear Kiefer Sutherland's take on this, along with Dennis Haysbert, Penny Johnson Jerrald, Elisha Cuthbert, Sarah Clarke, Xander Berkeley, Mia Kirshner, Peter Weller, Arnold Vosloo and Jayne Atkinson. . The rest of the special features are not long enough, especially a look into the music of 24, save for a forty minute look into how the camera setups on the show go. The sizzle reel for the 100th episode is very very cool, though. It definitely would have been exciting to see how the cast and crew celebrated shooting of the one hundredth episode.

There is also a Season Six prequel on the bonus disc of 24: Season Five.",1473292800,,3031,4.892996108949417

It's good because a real government defense agency didn't operate this way. We didn't have that many employees saddled with these much personal and family problems and let them hindered their jobs. There were so many background investigations that rarely did any one slipped  through the cracks and betrayed the country. I wasn't surprise that even Jack prioritized personal relation over his job responsibilities. He gave up his weapons and secret information too easily to the perpetrators. For example; he gave up his weapon when the German agent held up a hostage, he gave up the secret recording when the perpetrator pointed a weapon to Audrey. He tended to Audrey's injury instead of pursuing him and the recording. Did the writer of this show thought the viewers were so stupid that a top field agent or any police officer would give up his weapon and risked getting killed? That was what happened when they didn't have any law enforcement advisers for the show.",1466294400,,1142,4.738693467336684

Very one gets kidnapped or held for hostage and when they inevitably escape, they are always heading back to CTU and always get captured again only seconds after they tell someone at CTU they are enroute.  Squeezing each show into an hour fails to coincide with the travel involved. Traffic is backed up at times unless they need to be somewhere.  How can CTU have hundreds of Tactical units on the ready, yet they continue to fire the the smartest CTU Employees, only to bring them back to CTU to work, usually less than 24 hours. As far as the numerous spies in CTU, that scenario is way over board. I had a TS/SCI Clearance for 14 years in the Military.  They did a background on me from Birth and the same thing every 5 years. President Reagan had us all sign contracts that we would not speak of an classified information for 70 years after we were discharged. Wait til I am 110 years old to write my book!  Everything I know will not be classified by then. CTU is like the Obama Administration where all the Experts are ignored and the President is busy caring for Muslims/Gay People.  Also Transvestites being able to use any rest room they want.  The Pedophiles will be shot on site and Obama will be sued for his ignorance!  Will Obama let his daughters go to restrooms alone with Pedophiles and Child Molestors? Obama Voters took 8 years to figure out they are a bunch of Muslim Supporting  Socialists!  What Sex a Person Thinks they are has nothing to do with where they can decide to use the bathroom!  Simple Problem is add another restroom for ""All Others including Gays, Lesbos, Men who think they are women and women who think they are men!  And anyone who keeps changing their Minds or have no idea what they are today or will be tomorrow? I digress.  As far as 24, get a Retired Military Person for accuracy and Satellites do not sparkle in the Sky when they are watching you from Space!

2513525,5,B000EBCJN6,"A very fast and intelligently created series which keep compelling you to keep watching episodes after episodes. However, the writer has depicted in each episode the scenario of high importance and security and when the CTU team arrests the most wanted and dangerous criminal or terrorist, they carry him in an ordinary way and can easily be ambushed. Same happens when they go for a rad or while exploring evidences from a certain office or place with high trained official who are securing the area and monitoring the unexpected or expected threats and performing their duties as guards, are very easily killed when everyone knows how serious and dangerous the situation is? Each time, their teams are ambushed, attacked or killed with no relational reasons.",1454457600,,760,5.088
2513526,5,B000EBCJN6,"Enjoyed it when it was shown originally in 2006. Thought this was the best 24 season of them all.
The terrorist story line might be even more applicable today. Lots of surprises, a few situations seemed out of place.
President Logan and the First Lady's acting as well as the rest of the characters was top notch. As always, the production/music is great, connect it to your surround sound system.

There are still the quirks that occur such as a gun firing after the slide has opened or the wires being pre-striped when ripped from under the dash. Overall, the action keeps on moving and the plot is never predictable.",1446249600,,377,4.5588235294117645

Throw in the innumerable technical and continuity issues and the series is on a fast slide toward oblivion.

2514188,5,B000EBCJN6,"It's hard to fathom that Vice President Logan at first barely had a spine to be the leader of the country when he had to be sworn in as President after President John Keeler was unable to continue his role of serving the country after Air Force One was shot down by a domestic terrorist.  It was actually extremely funny that President Logan looked as if he had his head cut off from the rest of his body after he was sworn into office from Season 4.  He clearly wasn't ready to run the country as President of the United States.  He looked like a glorified middle manager.  It was refreshing seeing President David Palmer come in as an advisor.  He showed the dynamic leadership we expected a president should represent.  It's amazing that as an actor, I sure wish we had a President in the same manner in which Dennis Haysbert portrayed.  John Keeler represented a fairly decent president from Season (Day) 4 although it was very brief.

And then from all the conspiracy and assassinations that had occurred that had victimized President David Palmer, Tony Almeida, Michelle Dessler and almost Chloe O'Brien, it was almost hard to image that President Charles Logan was behind it all.  He looked spineless and appeared to be a weak leader from Season 4.  And then was this power mad egotistical evil man that almost pulled it off while watching all of Season 5.

To a degree, I have a love/hate relationship with Jack Bauer.  Yes, he stops at nothing to save the day and is indeed a patriot.  The bad thing about him is that too many people directly and indirectly die because of him.  I like the fact that despite being an extremely elite federal agent and former Army Delta Force Operator, he is an extremely emotional and conflicting guy deep down inside.  He misses his wife and daughter dearly and despite loving what he does as a field agent because it keeps him busy.  Deep down Jack Bauer is very miserable inside.  It was nice seeing Jack Bauer step down from being a field agent and working for James Heller (Secretary of Defense).

I only watched bits and pieces of 24 while it was on television.  I enjoy this series very much and look forward to binge watching Season 6.",1438560000,,2185,4.556410256410256

From Jean Smart's unbalanced First Lady to the manipulative president to the charming Morris O'Brien, the characters take you on an ever-churning ride filled with highs and lows. The characters have grown greatly, and have artfully been taken to new depths by the writers.

Conflict and differences of opinion on handling issues and emotions cause the viewer to critically think his own motives, actions, and viewpoints. Corruption and evil are painted in real portraits and cannot be denied--bringing a great dilemma regarding the correct response. Like a good book, the viewer cannot put it down.

My only complaint is the immature sniping. I think it is a bit overdone.

Otherwise, simply awesome!",1435968000,,834,5.449612403100775

2514391,5,B000EBCJN6,"Suspense action and drama all for a good cause. Why not love it. The only thing that could be done better is to condense 2 hours into 1 episode so rather than 24 per season 12 per season could have the same impact.  But I do want to know when these people take bathroom breaks, food breaks, etc. Seems like 24 hours of non-fuel non-rest",1434499200,,336,4.1692307692307695

Season 5 has huge, gaping argumental holes, to the point that makes me wonder why I'm still watching it.

2514694,4,B000EBCJN6,"The problem with season 5 is that there are too many utterly detestable characters including Logan and the homeland security guy.  Watching the episodes turns your stomach.  Frankly, Gregory Itzin completely overacts with all his facial expressions and smugness.  The action and storyline though is very good in season 5.  Also, I like that Bauer makes several critical mistakes in season 5 making him look fallible.  I agree with others that Jean Smart does an amazing job.  She's so good in everything she does.  Overall, if you can stomach it, watch it.",1426896000,,556,4.978260869565218

2514731,4,B000EBCJN6,"This season of 24 seemed like there were either tired script writers or a new crew of writers. The relentless cliff hangers of this series became more absurd, more over the top and more improbable. The series has an amazing ability to constantly be just about to show a total disaster when the heroic Jack Baur (Think 007 without the sexy flair and panache) inevitably saves the day, but not without a price being paid. Endless intrigues both within his group The Counter Terrorism Unit and without, never stop. Of course there are romantic interludes, occasional tragedies when nice guys get killed off so they can go act in other shows and bad guys get away so they can be chased another day, or another hour at least.",1426636800,,720,4.6328125

2514733,5,B000EBCJN6,"The award winning season 5 shows that the most deadly hazard is not a nuclear weapon, missile or bomb but rather humans themselves. President Logan is the most dangerous person/weapon/threat of the entire series. This is easily the most engaging of the 8 full seasons. There is no resolution halfway through and then a long build up to a new threat that was introduced mid-season. This is not only one of the best series in television history, but season 5 might be the most impressive season for any show...ever.",1426204800,,513,4.775280898876405
2514734,5,B000EBCJN6,"All 24 episodes are cliff hangers. Of course, it is 24. I didn't ever watch 24 when it was currently being broadcast because the seasons were not stand alone. I am very much enjoying watching them all on DVD, or on Amazon Fire. I can watch at my own pace, and take as much or as little suspense and action as I want. Season 5 was particularly enjoyable to me with all the plots and sub plots. Intrigue, corruption, sleazy politics, bold heroism, surprise betrayal, bitter irony. Its all there and more. Enjoy.",1426032000,,509,4.483870967741935

It's been great to watch the rest of the past seasons on my Amazon fire TV it's so EZ to use and as a prime member it's free  Im NOT a big TV guy and hate the cable company  But Fire TV is turning me in to a TV guy now if you can just get sports  . The Cable company  will be out of business,1424390400,,350,3.3797468354430378
2514850,4,B000EBCJN6,"24 continues to be a high-paced adrenaline rush in Season 5 that I find compelling. However, the storyline for this day was spread a bit thin and required a secondary storyline to complete the 24 hours. By its nature the series is formulaic and this is the first ""season"" that seemed much too predictable. Had me talking to the screen with objections regarding credibility and continuity issues. Still, watched the whole thing and don't feel it was a waste of time. Seasons 6 and 8 were better. Don't think I have seen 7 yet. As for Amazon's delivery... all good, no problems. Picture quality would be better on Blu-Ray but not as inexpensive or convenient.",1424390400,,657,4.721739130434782

2514858,5,B000EBCJN6,"Jack Bauer is the lead Counter Terrorism Agent in most of the series, sometimes with Presidential orders for his arrest, sometimes in cahoots with the government. There are new adventures in each of the series (I have finished up through season 8), and I cannot specifically remember season 5. It is an ongoing saga with the ""good guy"" in one show, working surreptitiously with terrorists in the next. Each of the 24 one-hour episodes (about 45 minutes if you have a streamer and can view without commercials, covers a 24-hour period. Start with Season 1. There are far too many events to cover in a single review. Bauer is a ruthless interrogator, so there is a lot of violence, romantic liaisons, corrupt politicians at the highest levels, friendships, family, plots and subplots. Kiefer Sutherland (Bauer)  is rumored to have earned upwards of $500K per episode, does most of his own stunts.",1424390400,,894,4.920529801324503

2514871,5,B000EBCJN6,"This was by far the best season yet of 24.  In the first seasons the plot contained a lot of needless detours with storylines that fizzled.  Season five has a great pace that maintains the suspense throughout.  Keifer Sutherland is an all-right actor.  He twitches his face a lot.  He doesn't have a soul so he has a hard time showing emotion.  He mumbles a lot.  Nonetheless, he fits the role well.  I think his most genuine moment of true emotion was when he programmed a memory chip to self destruct.  He gave a little smirk showing that he really enjoyed that twist, and it was a good Mission Impossible moment.  Speaking of Mission Impossible, the musical score became more Mission Impossible-like with more jazz notes and became better over all.  The show 24 is very entertainment and offers many glimpses into the global elite plan of initiating the New World Order, especially later on in Season 6 when DHS takes over CTU and with the talk of martial law.  If not a blue print for the global elite plans, then it is a great piece of (attempted) social conditioning to get people used to ideas such as the pragmatism of torture or the very real presence of Muslim extremists and their desire at world domination (just compare the public beheading of various journalists recently on prime time news and the televised beheadings by Muslim extremists in the show).  I believe shows like this are a drawing board of the Illuminati where they draw up scenarios, predict certain outcomes, and get people used to the idea of its reality.",1420416000,,1537,4.669144981412639

2514917,5,B000EBCJN6,"I think I liked season 5 the best. I love Kiefer. Whoever was working in the 80s early 90s, in charge of handing out roles for movies should of been fired. Because there was a lot of great talent that stopped getting work. Kiefer was one of the greats along with many others that you do not see anymore. I am happy Kiefer still gets work. People like Emilio Estevez and Lou Diamond Phillips, Where are they? I am surprised Charlie Sheen is getting paid as much as he does. His brother was always a better actor than him. I look at some of the actors today and most can't even act. They just look pretty but nothing more. Anyone can look pretty with a makeup artist, plastic surgery and the right camera angle. But acting takes skill.  It was good to see Kiefer and I hope to see more of him. This show is really great and very intense. If you like action this will keep you entertained. It got so intense in some points I had to pause and take a break. That has never happened to me. I am currently on season 7 and I am dreading when this all comes to an end. So far it has been very enjoyable. My husband laughs at me when I say 'Jack needs me.' (meaning heading to basement to go watch more 24).

There were SO MANY surprises in this season! SO MANY people I like were killed that there were times where I was speechless...

Up until the last episode (the ending of which took me completely by surprise - I had forgotten about those guys) -- most times I was on the edge of my seat!

As far as Jack -- I'm waiting for a nervous breakdown. As I've watched these I've considered that anyone living at these levels of stress would eventually pop!

Finally, I am totally impressed by the writing and appreciate all of the nights they stayed up trying to come up with a good story. Yes, some of it is far fetched but there are so many parts that could be believable that the crazy parts (breaking into a foreign embassy?) are quietly overlooked.

Anyway, I stopped watching it but people told me it got better. So I skipped season 4 hoping season five got better. Nope. The worst part of season 5 is the president is totally incompetent. So much so, I almost gave it 1 star. I gave it 2 stars because it has action, and I like the supposed real time action.",1415318400,,459,4.215909090909091

Just like a great page turner, I couldn't wait to get back to Jack.  My day to day life went on, but Jack was the spark that got me going every night.  And BTW an hour spent with Jack Bauer is the fastest hour you will ever see.  You're there in Jack's world, and before you know it, the closing credits are there on the screen.  You will desperately need to click on ""watch next episode"" and before you know it it's 4am, and you have to get up in 4 hours.  Beware!  Jack Bauer is addictive, but what a great, exciting, fun addiction it is!",1415232000,,715,4.086330935251799

The show is so good that I have decided to watch it over again. Except for a couple of episodes, I give the series a solid 5 stars right across the board. It fulfills all the requirements of a modern drama by including fast paced action scenes, plenty of pyrotechnics, espionage, high-tech intrigue and plenty of jaw dropping suspense. So if you have around 192 hours to invest on great drama, I highly recommend ""24"".",1412121600,,544,4.561224489795919

2515253,2,B000EBCJN6,"I have to say that I never watched the show when it was first on, but started watching on Amazon because so many people raved about it over the years. I'll continue to watch, but it is so predictable and cliche' that it's almost a comedy. The show reminds me of the thrillers where the teenage girl hears a sound at night and goes down to the basement or up in the attic or into the woods alone to see what it was. Everyone watching yells ""don't do it"" because it is so obvious. In 24, everyone that goes against Jack's instructions is wrong and someone pays the price and every Presidential administration and CTU always have some bad guy working on the inside.

2515282,5,B000EBCJN6,"I can't decide if my favorite season is four or five. My main drawback of this one is the killing of Michelle; for some reason I had difficulty getting over that. The seemingly killing off of Tony was not nearly as traumatic for me. However, it was an excellent season with superb acting. Martha Logan is one of my all time favorite characters of all the years. Of course, the Edgar scene--real tear jerker. So many edge of the seat moments and high suspense and the scenes with the Logans at the end were not a disappointment.  As always, is there not anything the invincible Jack can't do? Oh, an I loved Audrey this season, even more than in the last one. The back and forth scenes between CTU action and Presidential staff done so well to keep us going and guessing. Chloe, Bill Buchanan and Homeland Security lady (forget her name) were all excellent characters too and their acting was top notch. One of the best seasons, if not THE best.",1406851200,,944,4.488372093023256

2515291,5,B000EBCJN6,I am sadly addicted to 24. 24 has an amazing developing storyline that continues to intrigue me as the plot thickens.

2515293,5,B000EBCJN6,Everything about 24 is just awesome.  Keeps me on the edge of my seat and never fails to twist and turn right at the perfect moments.  I plan on going through every season until I reach the current one...which is a lot since each season is 24 hours!  I love that I can buy it on my Kindle Fire and download the episodes so that I can watch when a wifi connection isn't available!!

2515299,3,B000EBCJN6,I enjoyed the first 15 episodes or so. Then the story line started to get ridiculous and it took forever for something to happen. I endured the first 21 episodes but just read the descriptions of the rest and skipped to the next season. The first episode of Season 6 was very violent. It may be time for me to give up on 24.,1406678400,,324,4.078125
2515300,4,B000EBCJN6,Anything that can happen will happen on '24'. The power of the president pushed to the limit. Jack Bauer always on top of things. Its all about the OIL!,1406592000,,152,4.275862068965517
2515301,5,B000EBCJN6,"By far, this is the best season of 24. Unlike other seasons, Day 5 was not bogged down by ridiculous sub-plots for the sake of filling time (think anything involving Kim, Palmer scandals, or Dana Walsh) but managed to make each episode exciting and worthwhile. Jack is at his best in this season and the rest of the cast is just as strong (especially Jean Smart, Gregory Itzin,Jayne Atkinson, and James Morrison). In short, this season has all of the best features of the 24 series without any of the drawbacks of other (often subsequent) seasons.",1406592000,,547,4.708333333333333
2515302,5,B000EBCJN6,"Jack is dragged into trouble.  Sometimes by choice, sometimes against his will.  He escapes.  Something else goes wrong when all seems well.  The theme of the show, what can go wrong will go wrong.",1406505600,,197,4.705882352941177

2515314,5,B000EBCJN6,"Season after season this show gets better than the last. Every episode is filled with action, suspense and at times we get to see Jack Bauer's softer side. What I marvel at in the 24 hours of running, jumping, dodging bullets and CTU staff busy assisting Jack with computer assistance, no one ever looks tired or hungry. If I was running around like a lunatic dodging bullets or getting my butt kicked for 24 hours I think I would look like hell. But in TV land we play along with this and sit back and enjoy the show. I do and look forward to season 6.",1406246400,,553,4.226415094339623
2515315,3,B000EBCJN6,Very entertaining but a little far fetched. You'd have to believe in superman to believe this story.

2515322,5,B000EBCJN6,"Love it!! Even though ""some"" of the storyline ""seems"" improbable on the flip side it's very much believable. The main reason I love 24, besides loving Kiefer Sutherland is the show is NOT all sexed up. It's perfect for me and my teenage kids to watch. Occasional kissing or just got out or into bed scenes. That being said, these scenes are not overly Graphic. I feel safe watching all seasons of 24 knowing my teenagers and I are not going to have to watch unnecessary graphic sex scenes just so we can enjoy the action, adventure and great storyline.",1406073600,,552,4.53

We have gone through countless restarts of every device involved but the problems persist.  Amazon streaming service appears to be the culprit and has proven to be unreliable. At the same time Amazon degrades to useless, Netflix works fine.

Does take a while if you start with 1st season and go through the years in order but worth it. My favorite years had David Palmer in it as President.

2515469,5,B000EBCJN6,Well written episodes and well acting stars make the TV series well known and worth of watching.  It gives viewers an idea of how the world would be like when one wants to have power and achieve ones goal regardless of sacrificing the lives of others and how anger would create a mess not only for oneself but for others and all human beings on the planet.  This is a general statement to sum up what 24 is about.,1402358400,,413,4.215189873417722

I did not watch the show when it originally aired and I am not sure why.  No one but Kiefer Sutherland could play Jack Bauer.  My favorite character (besides Jack) is Chloe O'Brian played by Mary Lynn Rajskub.  Her acting, facial expressions and dialogue are excellent.  Great show.  Highly recommend it.",1402185600,,472,5.1866666666666665

The Hollywood scion, whose previous claim to fame was ""The Lost Boys"" brings it home as the ultimate American hero  Who else but Jack could be released from a Chinese prison camp and within HOURS be rocking and rolling with the bad guys???

2515476,1,B000EBCJN6,"I loved the first two seasons, but each season after those really began falling off for me.

Firstly, there is no character growth whatsoever.  Jack Bauer is almost always screaming his head off.  Also he loves punching his co-workers out.  How could you work with someone like that in a government agency like CTU.  There is no way in hell he'd be hired and if he was he'd be fired the instant he did something like that.

Furthermore, i don't like the happy coincidences.  Like the lone survivor on the submarine.  How could he be left to survive when we saw the terrorists had the layout of the sub and somehow managed to check every room, but that one?  There are more, but to list them all will take too long.",1402099200,,714,4.3893129770992365

2515478,1,B000EBCJN6,Exciting at times but it's either terribly written or terrible acting. I can't tell which. It's like a bad horror movie that you can't stop watching but know that it's not good.,1401926400,,177,4.5625

However, there are several places where the writers got themselves into a completely implausible situation and either didn't research Secret Service protocols or assumed the audience is not intelligent enough to notice.

2515486,5,B000EBCJN6,I first saw 24 about 4 years ago but never had to the opportunity to see all the seasons or episodes.  I recently became sick and ended up in bed for almost 5 weeks and took that time thanks to Amazon Prime to watch all the seasons of 24.  I loved every minute of it.

Keifer Sutherland is an excellent actor!  Once I am caught up with the original series, I can watch the new ""Jack is Back - 24.""  We need more shows like this and the original ""Shield"" with Michael Chiklis.",1401494400,,551,4.25

2515499,5,B000EBCJN6,"I started with season 1 and watched all 24 episodes over a week and half.  I'm now on season 7 and have watched 157 episodes without watching any other programs except the NBA play-offs.  The characters are at the ultimate end heroic or deadly dastardly. The suspense keeps me up passed my bedtimes watching because I can't stand going to bed not knowing what happens next.  I find myself pulling for some characters with an unmistakable emotional attachment.  Other characters I'm rooting for their demise. There are so many nuances, I think I know what will happen next and something expectedly interesting occurs. I love Jack's win-at-all-costs attitude and behaviors.  He demonstrates both the bad side and good side of being a super-hero.  That's more like real life.  The issues they deal with are real life in nature too but always extremely critical.  Chloe Is the matter-fact, tell-it-like-it-is, genius heroin.  She says things that most people think but don't say and is able to do technical maneuvers that most techies only dream of doing.  If you like suspense, if you like intense drama you'll love this series.",1401148800,,1125,4.967914438502674

However, about mid season I had to push myself a little to get through to the last 1/3 of season, and I am SO glad I did! WOW! talk about being on the edge of my seat. This season really does have more of an edge to it. A fictional Syntox gas, nerve agent,  is involved, terrorist plots, political corruption and some of the main characters are bumped off! Loved this season and would highly recommend it to anyone!",1399680000,,567,4.201834862385321

2515558,5,B000EBCJN6,"It is difficult to give a specific impression of the series. But the episodes are cleverly arranged and produced so that you want to find out how is he or they going to solve this or that next calamity.
Very cleverly done by ""witholding"" certain evidence, so that you have no choice but to watch the next episode to find out more.
Characters come and go, and I find myself 'aligning' myself with certain characters and all of sudden they are killed which is a bit disconcerting. Or we find that a particular ""friendly and sympathetic"" character is actually a ""baddy"".- not a good thing...
But I have enjoyed the series immensely and would recommend them to anyone who enjoys spy and drama movies.",1399161600,,696,4.620967741935484

2515576,5,B000EBCJN6,"Warning: this show is totally addictive! I used to do dishes and laundry late at night, but now it's all piling up on me, turning my home into a biohazardous zone.  We have watched all five seasons this year for the first time and are trying to catch up to watch the new season starting in May. This particular season won a lot of awards and for good reason.  The actors are so seasoned in their characters (not to mention, Kiefer Sutherland IS Jack Bauer) by this point and the writing has matured like an aged wine. If you think the bad guys are going to succeed in their practical omnipotence, you don't know Jack!
If so much as look down to fold a wash cloth into a square, you could miss an important bit of intel in the incredibly twisted and suspenseful plot that the 24 writers have cooked up.  Jack Bauer, we're begging you, just go somewhere safe, put on some bandaids...and for crying out loud, take a nap! .....On second thought, we're going to need you to keep saving the world...on a provisional basis, of course...",1398384000,,1029,4.4338624338624335

2515578,4,B000EBCJN6,"One of the better series I have seen in a while. Drags in spots when the writers try to get to complicated with too many plot lines at once, but that only ours in a couple of seasons. Well worth the time to watch! Good action and good character interaction.",1398384000,,257,4.16
2515579,5,B000EBCJN6,One of the best TV series ever. Re-watching all the seasons before the new show comes out in May. Can't wait,1398297600,,108,4.190476190476191

Also this series has people, even the bad guys speaking articulately and very rationally.  We are seeing a show full of admirable people not a bunch of losers.  That must be a part of the popularity of the series.

2515595,4,B000EBCJN6,The plot involving the president who looks and acts like President Nixon seemed very unrealistic.  It just made for strange watching in my opinion.  I prefer something that could happen for real while the actions etc. that surround it might be unrealistic.  Definitely my least favorite season.,1397606400,,294,5.212765957446808

2515613,5,B000EBCJN6,"I've only recently begun to watch 24....I was intrigued by the ""Live another day"" commercial I saw during the Super Bowl. Well, about 6 weeks into viewing and here I am, with only 4 episodes left to go in season 6. I've been utterly hooked from the get go. And without a doubt, season 5 was, to me, the pinnacle of the show. The acting, the storyline, the editing, the music......(yes, the music. It is perfectly synced to the action you are watching. Helps make the show all the more addicting). All of those were superior to all of the other seasons to this point. Every season has been enjoyable, with 5 being the gold standard. I can't wait to see if seasons 7 or 8 can live up to that standard!! So far, season 6, while not bad, is nowhere near the level of season 5. Enjoy! And by the way.....Charles Logan.....awesome! His facial expressions, his reactions to certain situations (no spoilers here) are hilarious and mesmerizing. I hated his guts when he first appeared on screen.....and within a few shows, I was singing his praises. Hope this was helpful!",1397260800,,1063,4.570680628272251

I have never been a TV ""hound,"" but this program is so thrilling and suspenseful--THE BEST PART OF ALL--IT IS CLEAN--NO DISGUSTING BEDROOM ORGIES, AND NO ""F"" WORDS.  What has happened to Hollywood producers that they feel they must inundate our living room with filth.  Just give me a good, clean movie with a good clean theme, like ""24.""",1396656000,,491,4.48314606741573
2515625,5,B000EBCJN6,"This show is addicting, there is no dull moment with this series. Jack, Kiefer, whatever you wish to call him is really the best at what he does. Sometimes I wonder if these are the things we do really face or if it is all just fiction. Whatever the case the show is great and can't wait for the Live another day mini series",1396656000,,324,4.078125
2515626,3,B000EBCJN6,"Still good, but not after the great season 4!  I also was not thrilled with the ending.  Kept me wanting to see the next episode.",1396656000,,129,4.12
2515627,5,B000EBCJN6,Jack Bauer is amazing! Season 5 carries on with great suspense and action. I encourage everyone to start the 24 television series because it provides hours of television entertainment.,1396656000,,184,5.379310344827586

2515631,4,B000EBCJN6,"We've been spending some down time watching the 24 series on Netflix.  One day it was not available and after some googling, we found 24 had switched to amazon.  Since we do have an amazon prime account, we were able to find it and continue watching the series.  I love having prime for the free shipping, but I must say that the instant video service needs some updating.  It is not nearly as user friendly as Netflix.  I do hope some changes are made in the near future or amazon will not be able to compete with the other choices out there.",1396569600,,543,4.284313725490196
2515632,5,B000EBCJN6,"Writing a series of episodes that resolve an entire plot in 'one day' is impressive by any measure. There must necessarily be many parallel threads and you must turn a blind eye to the fact that nobody just wants to lay down and sleep. The character roles are balanced and interesting with twists regularly popping up so people don't get stereotyped. With the exception of Jack Bauer, you never know who is going to die. I can't imagine watching this over a 24 week period. The suspense would drive me nuts. I need a break before starting season 6.",1396569600,,548,4.545454545454546
2515633,5,B000EBCJN6,Love 24.  The seasons get better as they go. Don't know why I didn't watch this when it was on TV but watching it now is so much easier.,1396569600,,136,3.689655172413793

2515636,5,B000EBCJN6,"I know I'm about 12 years too late on the whole ""24"" craze, but I'm binge watching now. Season 5 is the best of the series. I've lost so much sleep trying to catch up before new episodes air on Fox next month.",1396569600,,209,3.883720930232558

2515643,4,B000EBCJN6,"While I do find this series somewhat addicting, I find that watching the episodes in quick succession to have pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, I avoid the frustration of having to wait a week to see what's going to happen but on the minus side I find myself noticing that the story never really changes; i.e. someone or someone's at CTU are always getting charged for treason, fired or killed.  Jack's body counts are higher than what you might expect from a small nuclear blast, and the guy barely every gets more than 30 seconds of praise before he's arrested, abducted or cast back into yet another crisis.  I still maintain that I'm glad I didn't watch this series right after 9/11 as well as remain critical of the series for thinking it was appropriate to release such a series at that time, but can't deny that the series is addicting.  I just hope to heck that what we don't know that really goes on isn't nearly as horrific as portrayed by the writers of 24.",1395792000,,973,4.449438202247191
2515644,4,B000EBCJN6,I personally find the later seasons of 24 better than the earlier.  They surely do a better job of you hating certain characters,1395705600,,128,4.565217391304348
2515645,5,B000EBCJN6,"Above all, I find it hard to find a show or movie that is clean and yet interesting and exciting.  Although there is a lot of violence there is not a lot of gruesome details. The language is clean and there are no sex scenes. I really like the intensity, suspense and action. Overall, I think it is done well and the acting is great.",1395446400,,333,4.123076923076923

2515659,5,B000EBCJN6,Jack Bauer is one bad ass dude. Kidnaps POTUS & takes him hostage for a confession. Wish someone would do that to most of these jack---es in the White House.,1394064000,,157,4.266666666666667
2515660,5,B000EBCJN6,Although concept is old now...the content still amazes me.  Can't wait for new one to come out later this year.,1393372800,,111,4.55

2515662,5,B000EBCJN6,"The cast, crew and creative talent with 24 were in their prime with Season 5.  Such a joy to enjoy the season all over again.  Cannot wait for the 24 come back in 2014.",1393200000,,168,3.911764705882353
2515663,5,B000EBCJN6,This was the most bittersweet season of 24 ever! It gave you the suspense and drama that glued you to your seat and also made you miss characters you loved in subsequent seasons. Own this season if you are a 24 fan!,1393113600,,215,4.142857142857143

2515667,5,B000EBCJN6,Watched this series when it 1st aired.  It's just as compelling to watch again!  It's really a great aide to flying.  When taking that long flight to Frankfurt it keeps your attention on something other than long sitting in tight seats.,1392940800,,236,4.7073170731707314
2515668,5,B000EBCJN6,"As with the previous 4 seasons, this season is no different. Lots of drama, action, intrigue. Of course, Keifer doesn't disappoint with his fantastic acting, he is 24. The ending is very surprising which leads into the season 6 very nicely.",1392681600,,240,4.878048780487805

2515672,4,B000EBCJN6,"I highly recommend this season for those who like political suspense and intrigue in addition to the usual thrills of battling external foes.  Pres Logan and his wife, Martha are well developed; and the ""palace interplay"" offers a more complex layer of obstacles and intrigue.  Excellent and startling start to the season, as Jack is forced back into the game after Pres Palmer, Tony, Michelle, and Chloe are all targeted for death in episode 1.  Highlights include the airport hostage taking segment; and great characters including Bill Buchanan, Lynn McGill, Curtis Manning, Edgar Stiles, Christopher Henderson, Aaron Pierce, and others.  Really a good season with fine acting.",1392249600,,679,5.317757009345795
2515673,5,B000EBCJN6,"As long as you begin with Season 1, Episode 1, you wil never be disappointed.  I said this previously:  We watched it a few times in the mid 2000s, but didn't care to locate it again.  It OBVIOUSLY had to do with not understanding the characters from the 1st Episode.  NOW we can't wait to watch what happens in each following epidsode.  We're hooked!  Most likely, the best television action series my husband and I have ever experienced!",1392249600,,439,4.564102564102564

2515680,5,B000EBCJN6,"I am watching each season of 24 on Amazon Prime Video and thoroughly enjoy each season. The twists and turns in each story are amazing, plus the shows give you mystery, action, love, betrayal, and so much more. It can take some time to get through an entire season because there ARE twenty-four 45 minute episodes. But whatever time you have to devote to this series is well worth it.",1391472000,,384,4.5
2515681,4,B000EBCJN6,"Although much of the story is a bit outlandish, it still provides the viewer some ideas to consider for a possible end to the USA. The terrorist ideals are at times absurd yet thought provoking. The constant fighting and infighting is somewhat tiresome, yet generally worth watching.",1391385600,,283,5.042553191489362

2515687,5,B000EBCJN6,"24 is one of the best television shows ever. But I didn't find the show until the last two seasons, so I appreciate being able to go back and see the first years and the adventures/antics of Jack Bauer! Kiefer Sutherland has a way to make these events and fights, etc. look believable. He is a really good action actor. I just love being able to see each episode when I want and not having to wait a week to see what is happening. The only problem with this show is that I can't stop watching one episode after another and I am losing a lot of sleep!",1389830400,,550,4.101851851851852

2515712,5,B000EBCJN6,I never watched this show when it orginally aired. When I got amazon prime video I watched all 8 seasons within a two week period. It was like a good mystery book you couldn't put down. I'm watching for the second time now. It is really well written and very true to real life. Sutherland does an excellent job as Jack. I sure wish it was back on the air with new shows.,1380844800,,370,4.082191780821918
2515713,4,B000EBCJN6,"All of our government agencies, and especially CTU, must have really lax security standards. Every time you turn around, your BF is plotting against you at the workplace. Better to stay dark. Even the Presidency is suspect. Kudos to Jean Smart who played President Logan's wife. Her portrayal of First Lady Martha Logan was deserving of an Emmy. I don't know whether she got one, but she sure earned one.",1380672000,,404,4.785714285714286

2515723,4,B000EBCJN6,This is a very good show and by season 5 the back stabbing and sub plots just get to be a bit less amusing and so this season is lacking in a sense of plausible reality.,1378080000,,169,3.7222222222222223

Great all around tv show for those who love trying to call what will happen next.",1377734400,,164,4.5

2515730,4,B000EBCJN6,After watching Jack it is starting to get old as it is so crazy and after five season is all starting to look like the same crazy thing.  It still is fun though but since I am getting it from Amazon and you can watch more than one at a time that is probably what makes it so old.  If watched as originally broadcast that being one episode a week you would be waiting with suspense unlike now where it is really predicable at least as far as it goes for Jack.  But when all is said and done it is still fun.,1377129600,,506,3.8932038834951457
2515731,1,B000EBCJN6,"Ugh, I can't take it - making the presidents right hand man involved in terrorism ?! The first lady clinically insane.  Then making you think it's the vice pres, then it turns out to be the president himself.  Uhhh, yeah, right. I thought at first at least they didn't do another mole in CTU (which they had done every single stinkin season).......then, turns out they did have someone in there following the 'right hand mans' orders! But he 'thought' he was doing the right thing.  Either way, STOP RECYCLING THE EXACT SAME PLOT LINES.  And they still have everyone respond to anything with ""I understand"".  Choose a different line once in awhile !  I give this 1 star, no idea why this has an average of 4 1/2 stars.  This is by far the worst of the first 5 seasons I've watched. It's more boring daytime soap opera than action/drama like the seasons before this one.  Feel free to skip this season, I wish I had.",1376956800,,915,4.469879518072289

The twist  and turn of events leaves you wanting to watch that next episode NOW. The ending of the series leaves you wondering what Jack's fate will be and makesyou want to watch the next series.

2515765,3,B000EBCJN6,"It's clear 24 writers were running out of ideas by the time Season 5 rolled around because this one is much weaker than those that came before. While there are some interesting and surprising plot twists along the way, you may lose interest because the pacing is much slower, the characters much less likeable (President Logan is the weasel of the century and his crazy wife gets waaaay too much screen time) and the soap opera elements consume far too much time. Many favorite characters from earlier seasons bite the dust along the way, which is bad enough. But the ones that replace them are not nearly as strong, which brings down the entire season. Aside from season 1, this is probably the weakest so far The writing also begins to fall apart, with cheap gimmicks being used to get out of plot twists that don't make a lot of sense. This series is not high on the believability scale to begin with. But they at least made an attempt to explain everything. Now it's like, well never mind, lets get on with the action. Sadly, this gets even worse in Season 6.",1371081600,,1063,4.512953367875648

2515769,5,B000EBCJN6,"24 is MY ALL TIME favorite TV show edging out the Star Trek's by a nose.  The show just keeps you on the edge of your seat just about every episode.  I love the way it's done and Season 5 is the best yet and I never could have thought that after season 4.
Simply outstanding entertainment that keeps you guessing virtually every episode.",1369440000,,337,4.25

2515775,5,B000EBCJN6,"Loved Season Five, as much as each season before and after.  I like Jack Bauer, man! That dude is a perfect picture of someone who KNOWS what God put him on this earth to do--fight the bad guys--and even if he doesn't always like it, he's 100% into it whenever the situation calls for it! If I had that level of focus and commitment, I'd probably scare the hell outta myself and everyone else!!

When it comes to the bad guys, I don't know which I hate more--the ""foot soldiers"" who carry out the ""hands-on"" dirty work, the secret traitors in the government who aid the terrorist cause, the witless ""by-the-book"" folks whose proper procedural concerns end up allowing the bad guys to gain time and advantage, the folks whose psychological ""issues"" jeopardize delicate operations, or the faceless people at the top of the terrorist ""food-chain""--the ones who sit in safe towers and write checks and issue orders to kill millions because they wanna make a little more money!

This show never disappoints. It angers and frustrates--but it NEVER disappoints!!",1368230400,,1055,4.85
2515776,3,B000EBCJN6,"This season started out very strong, then fell off.  In early episodes Connie Britton did her usual wonderful job as a real woman who happens to be naturally beautiful and appealing.  The few moments of romance in this hyperactive action show are welcome, but the all-in-one-day conceit makes it hard to portray any character development.  Perhaps more could be done with flashbacks, but the audience apparently expects a shootout in every episode, and they get it.  It's a relief not to be fighting Muslims for once: by 2006 our anti-Islam frenzy was apparently waning, though those Russian separatists may turn out to be Chechens.  The pipsqueak President (I don't know the actor's name) should be played by a stronger-looking actor, if only to make his vacillation less predictable.  One more of his chin-raised, head-tilted, perplexed stances and I may scream, and his wattle is also very unappealing.  Infighting and betrayal at C.I.D. is standard in every season of 24, but gives a bit of variety to the main action of Jack Bauer punching/shooting bad guys.  This basic lack of variety was the franchise formula, however, and they obviously didn't want to meddle with success.",1367452800,,1182,5.056701030927835

2515778,5,B000EBCJN6,I'm really glad that Amazon Prime allows me to revisit 24. Jack Bauer has to be the most intense character ever on tv. If 24 were still on today it would still be the most watched show without a doubt.,1367107200,,201,4.05

IMO it is the most fast paced and less distracted (i.e. least amount of side stories) of the previous seasons. This is Kiefer at his best as Jack Bauer, and I loved watching him face off against his nemesis/former mentor played by the PERFECTLY cast Peter Weller, aka RoboCop.

Amazing season...fantastic action, great characters, and plenty of twists. Hard not to watch this season all in one sitting.",1364947200,,545,4.618556701030927

2515803,5,B000EBCJN6,"Season 5 is, without question, the most exciting, surprising, and well-written season of this exceptional series.  Super-agent Jack Bauer is once again thrust into 24 hours of non-stop danger and political intrigue; this season, he deals with terrorists ready to unleash nerve gas in Los Angeles.

The body count is sky high as Jack deals with a major assassination and the painful deaths of close friends. The special effects and music are of the highest quality and there isn't a moment that doesn't demand your complete attention.

Keifer Sutherland returns as Jack and he anchors the show with his phenomenal acting.  He is ably supported by Glenn Morshower (Agent Pierce), Jude Ciccolella (Mike Novick), Jean Smart (Martha Logan), and Gregory Itzin as the Most Despicable Villain Ever.

This is a fabulous season of non-stop entertainment.",1361145600,2,844,5.222222222222222

I bought all 8 seasons of the series and I hate to stop watching the episodes since I always want to know what happens next and I try to figure out what the next peril will be that faces Jack and his colleagues in CTU!.  Great series!",1357603200,,400,4.306666666666667
2515817,1,B000EBCJN6,"Whoever said this show was ""right wing"" is totally nuts. Except for the nose, Pres Logan is a dead ringer for Nixon. In case we didn't ""get it"", they had him kneel in prayer with his Chief of Staff like Nixon did with Kissinger during Watergate, and when his helicopter landed in the final episode, he waved to the crowd exactly the same way Nixon did when his copter took him from the White House for the last time.

6 1/2 of the 8 seasons had a black president. In all of those, the presidents were wise, honorable, saintly, and totally virtuous. The white presidents in the other 1 1/2 seasons were evil incarnate who make the real Nixon look like George Washington.

And of course no one dare suggest that 5 years after 9-11, terrorists who want to attack us with nerve gas might be Muslims is completely taboo. Not from the religion of peace!

This show was about as right wing as the ""West Wing"".",1357084800,2,902,4.389221556886228

2515821,4,B000EBCJN6,"24 is one of my favorite drama shows. A potential drawback is that the episodes don't stand on their own and ideally should be watched in sequence. In the past I have videotaped many episodes when they were shown as repeats on network television but I missed several episodes. I used my free credit to get an episode that I had not recorded, thus filling a gap between the episodes I had on videotape. This episode was good with good action scenes on the ambush of the motorcade of the Russian president and with the tension of what would happen to the first lady riding with the Russian presidents family. One question I have however is how often I will watch these. I have never viewed the episodes I videotaped. The shows are best viewed in sequence, but that is time consuming and the drama diminishes when you have previously seen the episodes and have an idea of what the outcome will be, something the series is pretty good at preventing for first time viewers as the story tends to avoid being too predictable as the series has established that almost anyone can be killed off suddenly.",1352073600,,1094,4.558375634517766
2515822,5,B000EBCJN6,Best season of the first five I have watched.  It really sucks you in. Just about watched this season of 24 in 48! Simply couldn't turn it off.,1348876800,,143,4.107142857142857

2515825,5,B000EBCJN6,"I didn't really notice ""24"" until it's last season. I heard about it before, but never really bothered to try and watching it until it's last season and was surprised that it was actually a decent show.

I then noticed that seasons 1-7 were availible for Prime for free, which allowed me to watch every season on amazon, which took a few months watching a few episodes each week.

Kiefer Sutherland plays Jack Bauer, the main character, who seems to have everything go wrong at the wrong moments, somewhat reminds me of Bruce Willis in Die Hard. Many things in this series such as the circumstances and outcomes are not the most realistic scenarios. If you are looking for a realistic type show, this is not for you.

Each season has many twists in its story, while some more obvious than others. As of this review I have finished all seasons of ""24"", and have enjoyed watching Jack Bauer's experiences throughout the series.

While I am not a die hard 24 fan, I still enjoyed the series and will certainly watch the movie if/when it does get released. Would recommend watching to those who haven't already been immersed by this show!",1331942400,,1134,4.626865671641791
2515826,5,B000EBCJN6,This season was the high point for the series and if you watch any season it should be this one although watching all the seasons is highly recommended.  There were surprises every episode and was never any really poor episodes.,1331337600,,228,4.7
2515827,4,B000EBCJN6,"Seriously, watching this as a comedy makes it much better. How incompetent can any agency be and this CTU group seems to just be that much worse.

One thing I watch for in a show is production value. I understand TV shows have lower production values than movies but this one almost scrapes the bottom of the barrel.

Just when you think the dialogue couldn't get more stupid, they prove you wrong.

The story line is supposed to take place over a 24 hour period  but little things...like jack Bauer's hair getting longer in just an hour make this a good comedy.

The whole story line revolving a US president is also good comedy. How anybody could get close enough to a first lady and drug her without the secret service reaching out and touching them is just outrageous.

This show is good drama. It gets you wrapped up in the story and does an excellent job of taking your mind off anything you are doing. I love to walk on my treadmill when watching this and the time flies by as I watch about 1.5 episodes.

I did rate this as 4 stars. That is my comedy rating. As a serious drama I would rate it lower. Too much BS and horrible writing to consider this a drama. Look for the comedy and this show will provide it to you many times over.",1329091200,,1241,4.277777777777778

But I just could not get over the whole plot line involving the incriminating recording of President Logan. The idea that the 'recording' was some valuable piece of evidence that Jack kept having to recover was just plain ridiculous. Jack had the recording for an hour before Secretary Heller took it. WHy didn't he make a copy? Why didn't he make ten copies? Then when he recovered it again, on the plane, why did he not play it for CTU when he was on the phone with them so they could make a copy then and there? Then Chloe only makes one copy and it gets destroyed.

What makes this even more ridiculous is that, in the final episode, they immediately played the new incriminating recording for the Attorney General. It made me realize what a load of filler the whole subplot about the recording was.",1318723200,3,919,4.470238095238095

I love the no hassle return procedure of Amazon. I immediately ordered season 6 because it was on sale at a good price. I processed the return through my Amazon account and returned season 5 for my credit.  Any way, I really didn't like season 6 when it aired because of the beginning, when nuclear bomb went off at the beginning of the season.  However, my husband wanted to watch it before going into watching  season 7.  I'm now  glad I ordered it because there were some good exciting parts that I forgot about.  I will always love ""24"",  and I will never sale back my dvds. If you are a fan go ahead and purchase season 6 and all the other series.

2515837,2,B000EBCJN6,"OMG CTU has been infiltrated...again. Since one highly placed mole was discovered in Season 1 the crack writers decided what the heck lets do it again. No sense in tightening security at the old counter terrorist agency. What's the point of having levels of security clearance if any hack can circumvent the safeguards? Madcap hijinks ensue. This is the stuff of daytime soap operas with guns, car chases and better acting (with the exception of the guy playing the President). I enjoy getting beaten over the head with simplistic character development as the next guy, but this show is too unrelenting in its effort to stupefy the audience into submission. A government sting puts WMD's in the hands of terrorists goes awry...again. CTU is understaffed...again. Gadzooks we have to get the mole out of jail and put him to work. Damn it! We're running out of time. Keep shouting Jack maybe we'll get it. The scenes with the President are equal parts ludicrous and aggravating. Even Rudy is brought down to his former hobbit height by the retched script. Here's a new wrinkle - the power structure at CTU is in turmoil. The chief is an ass and only sneaky, behind the scene chicanery by the indians can save the day. One of the criteria for upper management at CTU appears to be an inability to handle low grade job stress. How did Rudy get back into ctu without his precious key card? We had tighter security at my college cafeteria. If it weren't for kidnapping there would be no 24. Yo Jack - try shooting at the tires when a car is racing away from you. Why make a copy of the tape or put it on a server immediately? Hell, why not play it in a conference room to share the truth? And lets wrap it all up with the old no bullets in the gun trick.

Each episode is full of 'fillers' in the form or additional characters or contrived conflict, all within absurd twists of plot.

Second, air would be blowing through the ventilation ducts in Mall and most of the gas would have not entered the system, the scene at CTU was a little more convincing at least there was a fan moving a little air.

Since the initial chapter in which we witness the bloody massacre that will involve the coward assassination of the President Palmer and at the same time, will make to  collapse the marriage between Michelle Dressler and Tony Almeida.

A web of terrorists led by high governmental spheres has stolen 19 canisters that contain nervous gas, preserved and buried, residues of previous conflicts.

Along the series, we will watch three brutal threats when the terrorists decide to release its lethal container. And every mission with this admirable rhythm and high doses of tension will lead us to hair raising episodes all the way through.

All the cast was impeccable but it would be worth to remark the impressive performance of Peter Weller as Henderson, The wife of The President Logan, Chloe O' Brian, Bill Buchanan, Aaron Pierce and obviously the multiple facets of his protagonist jack Bauer who will have to face with multiple issues and complex decision take.

Absorbing, engaging and exciting from start to finish.",1261526400,,1071,5.167630057803469

2515866,5,B000EBCJN6,"The first five seasons of 24 are the best thriller/escapism you'll find on television. It's fast-paced, big-budgeted, over-the-top (sometimes WAAAAAAAY over-the-top), and mostly clever. But I don't think ANY of the previous seasons (or the lame season 6) can come even close to the excitment and joy of watching this fifth season.

Yes this season follows the same (tired) gimick of everything happening in real-time, but what set this season apart for me was it's more focusd plot-line. Several of lead character Jack Bauer's friends are killed or attacked and he's out to find out who and get revenge. Ok, sometimes the overall story arch DOES get side-tracked to the typical (terrorists trying to release poisonous gas), and sometimes it's not always that interesting (CTU gets infiltrated AGAIN!). But none of these side-attractions even BEGIN to take-away from the exciting central story which pushes along at break-neck speed and crediblilty (thanks also to the believable performances of the ENTIRE cast).

Like some people I try not to watch the show on TV and much prefer to wait for the DVD to come out which is why I can't recommend buying this season enough (thought why there's not subtitles on every episode is beyond me). Yes it's a couple years old now, but it's still the best (and most affordable) 24 episodes of action you'll find anywhere.",1229126400,2,1359,5.008849557522124
2515867,5,B000EBCJN6,"Everyone is now familiar with the adventures of Jack Bauer and the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU), particularly how each season chronicles the events which unfold hour after hour in a single day of Jack's life.

Having watched all the seasons, I dare say that Season 5 is the most engaging and exciting. There are various plot twists and by now, the characters are very comfortable in their roles and the viewers can associate with them.

This seasons carries on from Season 4 so it is best watched only after you've understood what happened in the previous season. While you can pick things up along the way, it's more tricky without the background.

I really enjoyed Season 5 (I think Season 6 was a little silly) and hope that Jack comes back strong in Season 7.

And Jack seemed to be the overly invincible superman in this season. I mean, he is in every season, but his trials seem to be overwhelmingly challenging this season. The White House is infiltrated, but every time you think its one person, it turns out to be someone. And CTU gets attacked....again!!
Seems to me that everything in this government unit gets easier to access every season. LOL Any and everyone can get in and out of this place with no problem. Maybe its time that CTU up the security protocol; the world will NEVER be safe if this place doesn't get better at protecting the people and their office!
A lot of very phony points are seen in this season, but you have to watch it because you are a fan of the show.  Is it good? Yes. Easy to watch? Definitely!

It's hard to blame the creators as they do fine with what they have, but the very nature of a one-day serial is fatally flawed. Jack Bauer, and the disaster(s) he alone can stop, must NEVER be resolved until the final (24th.) hour. Every trick in the book is used to prolong the story, and to keep Jack alive. This leads to LUDICROUS plot devices, which make watching it often painful. If this doesn't matter to you, then I'm sure you will enjoy it, but if a plot or story needs to make sense to be pleasurable, this season will drive you mad. Obviously, a LOT of care, talent, and clever ideas went into making this, but at the end of the day, I knew that I had thrown away a entire day, watching smoke and mirrors signifying nothing.",1217289600,3,843,4.24223602484472

He goes by a fake name and is starting to think he may get a chance at a normal life. However, someone is targeting the people who helped Jack disappear, for reasons involving an Anti-Terrorism treaty with Russia, which President Charles Logan believes will be the defining moment of his presidency. Jack returns to LA to uncover  the plot behind it all and to bring those responsible to justice.

This is personally my season. My most favorite seasons to least favorite are as follows: [5,2,1,4,6,3]. This is the one season so far where all twenty four hours bring the bacon home. The acting is superb from all characters, the plot is suspenseful, addictive, and unpredictible, and Jack Bauer inspires me with his determination, courage, fortitude, and sense of justice. A lot of season four characters return to help Jack, or to stop Jack. Guest Appearence by Sean Astin.

2515876,4,B000EBCJN6,"After four years of this show, you can predict everything that will happen:  constant meaningless techno-babble; at least one or two moles and double-agents within CTU; limitless supplies of bad guy machine gun fodder; the president and the entire government constantly hangs out in or around Los Angeles (despite the fact that the capital is still Washington, D.C.), technology working magically or not at all as needed by the plot; villains once (or twice, or three times) apprehended, effortlessly escape as needed to keep the plot alive; constant and ceaseless bureaucratic in-fighting at CTU so that Jack Bauer is forced to work outside the chain of command, and against or in secret from his own superiors at CTU and other branches of the government (Jack is pretty much the only person in the government with good judgment, and his judgment is unerring and god-like); the constant placing of Jack's loved ones in peril for purposes of emotional manipulation and ratcheting of tension; frequent torture of bad guys or anyone else who falls under suspicion; other agents are effortlessly killed--only Jack is hard to kill; in lieu of torture, terrorist demand and are given a written guarantee of immunity signed by the president or the attorney general.

These same tricks are used over and over and over.  And yet we keep watching.  Also, an attempt was made to respect the ""real time"" angle for the first season or so, but that quickly fell away.  In seasons 2 through 5, people cover distances or accomplish tasks in miraculously tiny amounts of time.  (Anyone who lives in L.A. knows that you set aside 1 hour and 1/2 hour blocks of time to get anywhere; you can't drive from Santa Barbara to downtown L.A. in 25 minutes.) An example from Season 4: You can't wake up a federal judge in the middle of the night, get him to sign a warrant, get a federal marshal and get the marshal and the warrant to CTU within 15 minutes of receiving a call from a terrorist telling you to do all that.  That's just not real, much less ""real time"" yet that sort of silliness now happens all the time on the show.  Also, time is often lost at the top of the hour, by which I mean that events often lurch ahead by 5, 10, or 20 minutes between, say, 10:59 and 11:01.  The ""real time"" element is now pretty much a joke.  And yet we keep watching.

Probably the worst thing is that the plot, viewed as a whole for the entire 24 hour period, never really comes together and makes sense.  There are always holes, and sometimes major ones.  Like one previous reviewer noted with regard to the fifth season, only four people knew that Bauer wasn't really dead at the end of season four--President Palmer, Tony Almeda and Michelle Dessler, and Chloe--and none of those would ever have ratted him out.  So who told the bad guys??

So even though we know it is silly and manipulative, and uses the same tired tricks over and over, and doesn't even try to respect its ""real time"" gimmick, and neither the details nor the big picture ever really come together and make sense, we keep watching the show because we love Jack Bauer and his unerring patriotism, bravery, decency, sense of right and wrong, and willingness to do the right thing often at great personal cost.  And we love how the show keeps the tension at a constant boil.  And we love the way Bauer frequently has to fight against the stupidity of his bureaucratic bosses; everyone can relate to that.",1211328000,,3442,4.644151565074135
2515877,5,B000EBCJN6,"The 5th Season of 24 is my second favorite season of 24 closely behind the thrilling 4th season. Season five is an even more suspenseful and pulse pounding day for Jack Bauer. The season never ceases to amaze me with the greatest introduction I've ever seen and also one of the greatest endings I have ever seen. Although it pained me dearly to see the death of David Palmer, one of my favorite characters (a Democrat who Barack Obama could never hold a candle to) in the show, the revelations that spawned from there which led to the unmasking of a massive government conspiracy that makes Watergate and Teapot-Dome look like little white lies.

The brilliance behind Season 5 lies within the fact that while there are many political aspects that exist throughout, the main point of Season 5 is to make people understand that even our government is not perfect and that corruption exists even in the highest levels. It also raises the main question, after watching everything you wonder - how much should the public really know? There's enough corruption within the government to turn the average American exposed to it into an anarchist. This massive conspiracy that is revealed, while the terrorist Vladimir Bierko is very at large and must be stopped by Jack Bauer, the real ""bad guy"" is someone else and others similar. How much information would you really wish to know, and what information is best kept out of the public's hands?

I think in this case, unfortunately James Heller was right. It's best that the public does not know even though Bauer tries to expose it as much as possible. Some people may disagree, but you'll get a chance to form your own opinion afterwards.

Aside from all this political and media jargon, the fifth season of 24 is my close second favorite, and there is non-stop action, some amazing plot twists, and a very very dramatic story revolving around Jack Bauer and others such as Audrey Raines. I hope this review was helpful to you.",1207872000,4,1972,4.743440233236152

2515881,5,B000EBCJN6,"I initially learned about ""24"" from watching it on the Fox channel during Sunday nights. Having only read a variety of Jack Bauer quotes and hearing much mythology related to the series, I was eager to give it a chance. Of what I saw, it pleased me greatly, but I was still only receiving an unconnected series of episodes relating to Jack Bauer and CTU (his agency).

A few months later, I decided that I wanted to watch a whole season at a steady pace to get a true feel for the series. I came onto Amazon and browsed Season 5's page, as I was recommended it by many fans. Seeing it for $20, I made the purchase and eagerly awaited it's arrival in the mail.

---

Now finished watching Season 5, I can say with certainty that this is one of the finer shows on television and among the few i'd recommend collecting on DVD.

In this season, we're presented with a masterful blend of action, conspiracy, drama, and espionage that doesn't let up until the end. It's amazing experience to compare the progression of events all the way from the first hour to the final hour.

The character of Jack Bauer is given an incredible amount of detail here by scenes that illustrate to us his two sides: his professional side and emotional side. The former shows us his unwavering dedication to the United States and why he does what he does, the latter shows us that he is indeed like everyone else with his friendships and romantic relationship. When the two clash, it truly becomes relevant to the story as a whole and the growth of Jack.

On the villainous side, there are two masterful performances here by actors Peter Weller and Julian Sands. Weller's ""Christopher Henderson"" is a man motivated by duty of his country like Jack, but in a fashion that is in all other ways antithetical to the protagonist of the story. Needless to say, they clash with explosive results. Sand's ""Vladimir Bierko"" maintains a chilling silence about him and manages to instill fear in the viewer without becoming an over-the-top comic book villain.

The organization of CTU is given the full treatment as well - we see politics, power plays and personal relationships that formed and will form the way Jack interacts with them in Season 6.

Also, I can now vouch for why this season is best for beginners: while it is five years in, not many of the previous plots and subplots have an overbearing presence on the show which necessitates being knowledgeable of past events. In short, it's an excellent way to get into the series, as well as way to spend the evening around the TV to the uninitiated alike.

Finally, while there has been some dissent on the new slimmed down packaging for the DVDs, I must say that they are made well enough and damaging them shouldn't be an issue unless you place heavy objects on the empty box.",1203552000,,2802,4.565737051792829
2515882,4,B000EBCJN6,"(BEWARE, SOME SPOILERS BELOW)

Man, this is really a violent, dark and totally avoid of humour show. But's the beuaty of it: there shows around about very differente themes.

The proposal of 24 hours is to give you non-stop action, non-stop twists and, also, a lot of bloodshed. It's interestin also to see through the shows the incredible amount of highly trained, superbly financied and intelliegnt people willing to do harm to good old Uncle Sam, be them American, Muslin, German, Rusian... Also, the terrorists portrayed in the show are capable of mobilizing killer squads in less time than it takes to say ""Killer squads""... But, suspension of desbelief is something required to any show (if we wanna just see reality, just check the news, not a show!), since they respect tha canon and ""mitology"" described by that show itself. In that respect, 24 is respectul to itself.

I'm also one of those that consider Season Five the best season of them all. There are so many ingredients. Kim Raver is acting better than ever... the rhythm is breathtaking all the way (although the death toll is incredible high, even by thwe show standards - to kill Almeida, David Palmer, Michelle, Edgar Stiles, all of them in one single season... uau...)

Yes, I denitely think this is the best season of 24 until now.",1201996800,,1303,4.803571428571429

There is no point in going into the Season 5 plot here but suffice it to say that the political aspects, developments and twists portrayed in this season have no parallel in any of the other seasons and are the main reason for this season being the most exhilarating ride I've experienced on film - ever. A special mention must go out to the immensely talented Gregory Itzin for his portrayal of the flawed - and brilliant - President Charles Logan. The perfect antithesis to his predecessor, the predictable ""good guy"" President David Palmer, Logan is an immensely rich and complex character - he resembles Nixon in more than looks alone - and Itzin's intelligent and studied portrayal lends the show itself huge credibility. The world may think it is divided into good and bad guys, but it's those who are both who make history. A note to the producers - PLEASE bring Itzin/Logan back beyond the 6th season. Outstanding and highly recommended to any political junkie.",1201132800,,1047,4.9209039548022595
2515885,5,B000EBCJN6,"As Amazon.com's synopsis states, 24 literally starts right up and scarcely slows down at all throughout its 24 episodes.  Things that happen this season will both shock and surprise you.  Season 5 is arguably the best season of the series so far, although I think it ranks right up there with Season 4.

One of the great things about this series, and this proceeds right into this season, is that anything can happen to anyone.  Perhaps that is why this is the best on-the-edge of your seat television show that is on the air now, and possibly the best of all-time.  I've talked to many people who say that after watching a few episodes, they need to take a break, because it is that intense!  But this is a good thing.  Every dangerous situation that occurs, you wonder if one of the characters that you've grown to like will suddenly be killed.  That is why nobody is safe in this season or ANY season for that matter!

I'm not going to go into too much detail here.  Because the show starts right off from the very first episode, it would be a serious mistake and lack of respect to those who have yet to watch this season.  Suffice it to say, terrorists are back and ready to rain terror upon the city of Los Angeles.  Jack Bauer is unwittingly brought back from 18 months of living underground.  Someone from Jack's past is also introduced here who plays a major role in what is going on.

Kiefer Sutherland is still fantastic as Jack Bauer.  Watching Jack Bauer work is like watching a grandmaster chess player thinking out his moves and trying to out-think his opponents.  This, to me, is what makes him so appealing.  He's not only physically intimidating due to his special forces training, but he is incredibly smart.  I almost consider him the ""Batman"" of special agents.  And when there is a crisis, there's nobody I'd rather have on my side than Jack Bauer.  It's always amazing to me how he puts himself in dangerous situations without worrying about whether he'll come out of it or not.

Many characters have come and gone, but Chloe O'Brian may well be the best one.  She's still got an incredibly annoying personality, but she's the best computer/tech person around, and Jack's awfully lucky to have her in his corner.  She still displays annoyance at being questioned or accused, and she still also tends to resent authority to some extent, but that's what makes her so appealing.  She's not perfect, and she's not supposed to be; such is the case with all of these characters.

Another actor that I've enjoyed watching since the last half of last season is James Morrison as Bill Buchanan.  He's head of CTU, and he runs it like a true professional.  I think he was a great addition to the cast, and he plays a vital role in this season's plot.

You might think that it's easy to play a bumbling president, but it's not.  I have to really admire the acting abilities of Gregory Itzin as President Charles Logan.  He plays Logan in a way that will make your skin crawl.  God help us if we ever have a president like this! (although some already argue that we do now!).  He's always asking for someone else to make decisions, and he seems to be a true coward at heart.  In many ways, he's the antithesis of President Palmer.

There are some old faces that you will probably recognize, such as actors Julian Sands, Peter Weller, and C. Thomas Howell, and they all play their parts well, especially Weller.

As with all seasons of 24, nothing is what it appears to be, and the writers do a masterful job of playing with your emotions to divert your attentions away from the true villains.  They might introduce someone that you don't like, and you might suspect that this person is behind the plot, and then you find out you were wrong.  Or, they introduce someone that you actually like but would never suspect.  Suspicion and mistrust are everywhere, and part of the fun as the viewer to figure out the pieces of the puzzle.  This is an aspect of 24 that makes it such a phenomenal show, and believe me, there's no drop off here in Season 5, which has a surprise ending that will knock your socks off!

2515888,5,B000EBCJN6,"POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING----

Season 5 of ""24"" is largely regarded as the best.  I am sure that I am in the minority by saying that Season 3 is my choice as the best of the group, with Seasons 2 and 4 close behind.  I will say that the entire cast of Season 5 turned in magnificent performances, whereas in the past you could only say that about some, but not all of the cast.

As you know the season begins ""with a bang"" as one of the major characters is killed.  In fact the first couple of episodes were so action packed and dramatic that they felt like they were 10 minutes long.  I did take issue with the fact that so many great characters were killed off throughout this season and from what I have heard about Season 6 that may not have been the wisest move by the writers.

In addition, Season 5 really seems to revolve around President Logan, played fantastically by Greg Itzin.  This really gave characters like Mike Novick, Aaron Pierce, Walt Cummings, and Martha Logan a chance to shine.

24 has always been known for its memorable villains and the ones in Season 5 live up to the high standards set by seasons past.  Peter Weller does a great job as a corrupt former CTU agent and it is interesting how Jack is forced to use him in order to uncover the terrorist plot in this season.  Towards the end of Season 5 there is a fantastic episode that takes place inside of a Russian Submarine.  In addition, the funeral procession for President Palmer is incredibly moving for a TV show.

As mentioned previously, my main complaint is with the deaths of so many characters who really made the show great in the past seasons.  At some point the writers would have to ask themselves why would anybody want to work at CTU when the agents always end up dead?  Also, it's about time security got a little bit tighter at CTU headquarters, which continues to be breached.

All in all another great season for 24 despite a few flaws. Here is hoping that the writers did not overplay their hand here and have something left for future seasons.",1197331200,,2044,4.410666666666667

What a way to start the show.  Kill the ""Progressive"" president.  Kill Michelle.  Nice.  Then later that fool Edgar dies.  So long Mr. Potato Head!  Then Tony is permanently taken out of play.  Bye Bye Moe.  I liked most of those guys, but all of them were pretty much out of the show anyway (except Potato Head).  I am still waiting for Kim to die.  They must be saving that one for when the plot line or the show's popularity wains.

Suspention of disbelief is really the key to enjoying this series.  That made me upset in the begining, but by the fifth season, I have allowed the fantasy to wash over me.  In fact the less you think and try to figure the show out, the more you will enjoy it.  Perhaps my review of season 3 sould have been higher if I had this mind set then.

As much as I love the black president, I love this Nixon clone better.  The writers seem to depend on Jack having to work against a jerk boss at some level or another, and making the jerk the president was a welcome change from the previous boy scout.  I'm glad they didn't show more than they did during his sex scene.  I was worried.  It did seem to be over in just a few minutes.

This series has improved during this season.  Again because Kim is gone, though she does return during a gas attack.  I was hoping she would choke to death, but no luck.  She didn't bring her one handed boyfriend but some older dude that Jack tried to take on.

Jack is still Jack.  By that I mean that he doesn't seem to be able to do anything wrong on any level.  While his actions might result in the deaths of many many people, somehow it is always the right thing to do, and the show moves on.

I liked the part where he resisted NERVE gas by holding his breath.  Something that potent would have penetrated his skin VERY quickly.  I hope that before the series is cancelled, that it is revealed that Jack is actually Superman or one of his direct desendants.  Nothing else would explain his ""Eagle Powers.""

I must mention the choice to include Sean Astin (aka Rudy, aka Samwise Gamgee, aka a goonie) as one of Jack's boss.  He did a good job being a jerk, but I couldn't help wanting him to call somebody ""Mr. Frodo.""  It was satisfying seeing him get his butt kicked, then die from the gas.  However characters like him should be allowed to say lines they made popular in other movies.  He could have worked in the line ""I aint droppin' no eaves!,"" or something to do with One Eyed Willie.

The new token black guy they have is good.  You know he is not going to die as long as there is not another main black character.  As soon as they get one, he better watch out.

Finally, a comment on the ending.  Unless you were thinking, which ruins this series, the Chinese capturing Jack is a big suprise.  I love it.  However the Heathen Chinee don't know that ol' Jack may be wounded, tired, and chained; but give him two episodes/hours to heal and he'll be tip top.

season 1: great
season 2: good, dialog repetitive
season 3: tedious, repetitive, lackluster writing, morally ambiguous
season 4: getting good again, regaining some chops

Season five was very good overall, 4 1/2 stars.  Some of our old CTU friends meet unpleasant ends, and quickly.  That will outrage some fans, but it will invest others in the action and outcomes and keep the writing fresh.  The plotline is direct and action-packed, and with the obligatory end-of-episode twist we all so love.  I found this season much less soapish, although there were about three or four very superflous moments costing this set 1/2 star.

A word of caution...explicit violence is the 24 brand.  Terrorists aren't trying to hurt us with words, rubber bullets or snowballs.  Jack Bauer uses the terrorists own medicine against them...in abundance.  This is probably the most violent show on TV, and is not suitable for most children, hyper-sensitive adults, or liberals who think that terrorists are just normal people born noble and good, and mean us no harm.

Gregory Itzin returns from last season as President Logan, and is on display for our loathing.  He is surrounded by a divided cabinet and staff, and a neurotic First Lady brilliantly underplayed by Jean Smart.

Peter Weller is excellent as whiskey-voiced Christopher Henderson, a CTU prequel to Jack.  The writers do an outstanding job of disguising which side of the terrorist/patriot line he is on, all the way to the last episode. (Honestly, I can't believe how much he sounds like Lee Marvin)

Jayne Atkinson portrays new addition Karen Hayes, a Homeland Security director sent to assume control of CTU.  Will she see the light and realize that Jack runs all security in America?  She comes to CTU with her smarmy, brown-nosing, power hungry assistant Miles.

James Morrison returns as CTU chief Bill Buchanan, and has the best line in the whole season when he tells Miles ""Get out of my way, you little *ss-kisser.""  Cheers went up around our living room.

Chloe's back...""Fine!  Hhhhh...""  Chloe has her finest moment yet in a hotel bar where a drunk patron hits on her.  You don't want to miss it.

Probably the worst 24 casting of all time was Sean Astin as a honcho from Division.  I kept expecting him to blurt out ""You can do it, Mr. Frodo!""  He needs to work on losing that Irish brogue before being cast as an American, which we were supposed to believe.  His brilliance in LOTR is his downfall here.

And of course, there's Jack.  To be honest, Keifer was miscast in this role from the beginning.  He is not a deadly, or even imposing looking man.  In fact, he's usually the physically slightest guy in every scene.  That's what makes his portrayal of Jack so great.  He has the best mind, quickest reflexes, surest aim and most loyal supporting cast in law enforcement.  He can operate any electronic widget, fly anything, shoot any weapon with marksman skill and secure presidential immunity faster than anyone.  He kills and tortures with PC sensitivity.  Add to that, he carries a man-purse...the famous JackBag...which would make Felix the Cat envious.  It probably also excites all those happy fellows working the fashion houses.

Finally, we are left with just enough loose ends to set up next season, something writers always do when locking-up network series renewal.

This season receives a high recommendation from me, and I promise you will want the next episode badly.  Good thing the first four of SIX are available as a pre-release on DVD.",1170720000,7,3547,4.8957983193277315

After the season was over, My goal was to watch all of the seasons before the start of season 6, and did just that. Each new season was better then the one before. If you missed the seasons before you might as well by the box set, it will save you alot of money. I bought everyone seperately. If you are not sure to buy, just go ahead an DO IT! If you can't handle intense-action-packed-drama, don't buy this, because that's what you are getting.",1170720000,,549,4.339805825242719
2515933,5,B000EBCJN6,"Yet another GREAT episode!  Thank God for a TV series that has the courage to let America have a very small dose of the TRUTH!  If we really had 50 men like Jack Bauer, this country would be what it once was -- a truly GREAT Nation!!!",1170633600,3,234,3.9574468085106385
2515934,5,B000EBCJN6,"Love the show. Period. Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).

Season 5 is probably my favorite season to date. It starts strong and doesn't let up until it's over.

As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 5, however, breaks from this tradition and instead packages the discs in 4 slim cases (the 4th holds the bonus features disc). A change of page in packaging, but still quite attractive, with approximately the same shelf footprint (if not slightly smaller).

Season 5 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and bonus features. I might note however, they've added a slightly longer intro before getting to the main menu (looks like booting up and logging into a CTU computer system). However, on my DVD player I could skip ahead without having to play the whole sequence. So, it wasn't completely ungainly.

The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.

Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well. There are some ""intense"" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all.",1170288000,2,1876,4.831775700934579
2515935,5,B000EBCJN6,"After being framed for the assassination of a powerful politcal leader and several federal agents; Jack Bauer surfaces from hiding in order to clear his name and to find those responsible. The deaths are connected to the day's scheduled event of a Presidential signing of an anti-terrorist treaty with Russia. Once a group of Russian radicals take over an L.A. airport and begin executing hostages; it becomes clear that they will stop at nothing in order to prevent the treaty's signing. As Jack attempts to track the terrorists down, he soon realizes that someone even more powerful knew that he was alive and is now manipulating his every move.

Kiefer Sutherland returns with a ground breaking performance as Federal Agent Jack Bauer. Along with Sutherland is an all star cast including emmy nomminees for 2007. Sean Callery provides a fresh and original score for this must see thriller. The writers have definately out done themselves this year. The entire season is one main storyline which will keep viewers holding their breath until the end. Each episode is in strong succession to the previous hour creating the overall finished product of one bad day. There are events which are slightly independent from the one which follows it, but they all connect masterfully as terrorist events within a twenty four hour period. Surprises of the season are revealed immediately as well as mid season, but they all will leave fans in awe. Elisha Cutherbert returns as Kim Bauer, but as just a minor role in easing the storyline. There is the continuous use of CTU workers fighting with one another and doing stupid things, but not to the point of drasticly slowing down the main story. These occurances are minor and get over fairly quick. The highlight to the season is its resolution and cliff hanger, it will leave the viewer demanding more. The best trait to this season is its simple idea expanded over a believable twenty four hours and its creative story telling. Not since season one, has 24 been so cleverly delivered and filmed. In this regard, season five is definately as good and in some aspects better than the original.",1170201600,,2134,4.895027624309392

The story is just as compelling as the other seasons, but I wouldn't say that this is the best. I like the star power that is in this season, Peter Weller (Robocop) being one of them. But, the real star of the season is the person who is the current President of the United States. He does an incredible job and has the look and feel of Nixon, which I'm sure his inspiration for the character came from. Sadly, some of my favorite characters die in this season, but it is still really great. If you are a fan, this is a must see!",1169769600,,635,4.170731707317073

But I do have some criticisms as perhaps it's getting a bit formulaic:
 - There always a mole in CTU (mind you why should we be surprised, the CIA has similar problems)
 - An innocent person is tortured as a suspected spy
 - Old cast members (especially Kim Bauer who can't act and adds nothing to the show except being a disaster magnet)coming back in
 - Jack always working outside the CTU rules but someone inside always helps him

I would've paid a little extra for the 'old' packaging. I hope the someone in the production might read these reviews. Otherwise, a superb series.

With the help of Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard), Michelle Dessler (Reiko Aylesworth), and Chloe O'Brien (Mary Lynn Rajskub), Jack fakes his own death and goes into hiding.

As day 5 begins, Jack has begun a new life using a fake name. Soon enough, he is forced to leave his new life behind when it becomes apparent that the people who helped Jack fake his death are being targeted and Jack himself has been framed for murder. Jack's dilemma leads him back to CTU Los Angelos, now headed by Bill Buchanon (James Morrison). He is also reunited with the woman he used to love, Audrey Raines (Kim Raver). But love will have to be put on hold, as potential murder charges are not the only problems Jack Bauer faces. Much worse things are to come.

24's fifth season is a mixed bag. The first episode is one of the most exciting episodes the series would ever do, and there are many other high points throughout the season. Unfortunately, the season suffers a little bit in areas mainly due to the fact that 24 is experiencing the same problem that all shows do as they age: familiarity breeds comtempt. There are moments in this season that while good in their own right, simply feel a little too familiar. Fans may roll their eyes at the prospect of yet another mole within CTU (seriously, the security in this place is beyond pathetic), and Jack being forced to operate outside of CTU's authority because someone will ""only deal with him."" But even if we get a few low points in season 5, they are more than made up for by some of the high points. You won't be able to turn off the latter half of this season.

There is much more that could be said about the quality of these episodes, but not without giving away some of the surprises that are in store for you. How do the special features measure up, you ask? The special features in this set are just as wonderful as the last few season sets have been. You are treated to commentaries, documentaries, a prequal to the following season, and many deleted scenes (also with commentary).

24 season 5 also stars Gregory Itzin, Jean Smart (who deserves special recognition along with Itzin), Louis Lombardi, Sean Astin, Roger Cross, Elisha Cuthbert, and William Devane.",1168473600,3,2455,4.610983981693364

Season 5 has expanded the action by presenting a multiple event show, with a major difference with respect of season 4. In fact in season 5 the duration of the single events is not, like in season 4, constant. Here they have a different timing, much better mixed and everything flows rather fluently.

Action is always at high level... and tension is maintained throughout all the episodes.

The plot continues to be surprising, not just a formula.  I find it impossible to watch just one episode with the constant excitement and mystery of the 'what's coming next' script

2516021,5,B000EBCJN6,"As usual Kiefer Sutherland is at the top of his game in this series.  Few actors have garnered such rave reviews as he with his performances in the first five seasons of this series.

Season Five is easily the best season thus far, although I have to admit I was disappointed to see Tony Almeida and Michelle Dessler killed off in this season since they formed a major part of the wonderful chemistry between the actors and the plots from the very beginning in Season One.  I was also disappointed to see Dennis Haysbert (as David Palmer) killed off despite the fact that he was no longer President.  They should have kept him alive.

Nevertheless, the suspense in this fifth season of 24 was nothing less than nail-biting, edge-of-the-chair, run-your-fingers-through-your-hair from the moment Hour 5 begins.  The cliff-hanger that ends the season, setting up the viewers for Season Six, was completely unexpected.  My mother-in-law, who had never watched 24 before Season Five, was totally hooked.

As a lifetime engineer in both electronics and broadcasting, I've been personally fascinated with the technology used throughout the series.  A friend who works for the Federal Government in one of their technology divisions tells me that they are just beginning to implement some of the phenomenal intelligence-gathering and space-photography capabilities we've been seeing in this series.  That adds all the more spice to the program for me.

Can't wait for Season Six.  It has all the makings of a real winner, too!

If you haven't seen Season Five yet, make sure you watch Season Four first so that you have all of the connectors that make this one fantastic ongoing story.  Use your TIVO to record Season Six, but don't watch it before you've at least seen Season Five.  You won't regret it!",1168300800,2,1796,4.959866220735786

I felt the 5th season was excellent (one of, if not the best), and I think the current actors on the show really work well together.  The season includes watching Jack Bauer come out of hiding in order to stop some political radicals from terrorizing Los Angeles.  He continues to fight them and all the underlying groups/organizations who are helping them.  You'll never believe who ends up being their supplier!

I loved the show from then on, but knew I would have to get caught up to know what was going on. I never watched an episode again for a long time (because I always worked when it was on). Recently one of my friends was telling me how great a show 24 is, and a store had the Seasons 1-4 on sale for $16, so I decided, why the hell not. I bought Seasons 1-3, then four and now 5. This is by far the best TV show I have ever watched. You will litteraly get hooked on it, as you will want to know what is going to happen next. It's full of plot twists and will not put you to sleep, it is very good.  Season 5 resumes a few months after Season 4.  This one is non-stop all the way.  Jack is forced to come out of hiding after...well if I told you it would spoil it so you will have to watch.  This one takes a turn to where you would never expect.

2516041,5,B000EBCJN6,"You know the saying ""you want things done right, you have to do it yourself?"" That's Jack Bauer. Fighting off terrorists and preventing attacks while dodging death, all in a 24 hour period. His harsh methods have many questioning his motives, but usually getting the results needed in the end, which makes him the best at his job as field agent for CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit). In each season though, we find that even though he is honored for jobs well done, it does however take a toll on him and everybody around him. He's endured the murder of his wife, and being disconnected from his own daughter who loves him, but can't deal with the danger that's constantly around him. In season four, the Chinese government sought to apprehend Jack after leading a mission to kidnap a suspect from their consulate which led to the accidental death of one of their officials. Someone then came to kill Jack, but not before he could fake his own death and escape. In season five, Jack is living under the radar. With that in mind, you almost wouldn't expect something to go wrong...but doesn't that usually happen on this show? Former President David Palmer is assassinated, framing Jack while terrorists threaten to attack with deadly nerve gas. What is usually seen as a very long day for Jack Bauer only gets worse.

If you're not addicted to 24, start on season one. You won't regret it.",1168041600,,1384,4.672131147540983
2516042,5,B000EBCJN6,"Having finally caught up on all of the seasons of 24, I can say that season 5 is the best.  This is saying a lot as every episode of every season is great.  I kick myself for not starting to watch 24 when it started, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching the seasons back-to-back.  I'll get a taste of having to wait week to week when season 6 starts.

The killing off of a few major and beloved characters was a huge blow.  But, any fan of 24 knows that no one is safe.  And the deaths of these individuals, along with the threats against others, really sets up Jack Bauer's devotion to getting the bad guys.

Jack is more ruthless that ever, less willing to take orders than ever, and better than ever.

I couldn't begin to outline what happens...not that I would anyway.  Those reading this review may not have watched it yet.  Even if you've never seen an episode of 24, you have to see this season.

You can tell he means it when he acts.  Maybe if we had a few more of him around we could weed out the bad apples currently in our government.  Don't get me started on saying names!

Seriously though, the premise of 24 is to tell the story of a 24 hour day with 24 episodes (each one representing an hour).  Kiefer usually pulls an all-nighter because there is something semi-important going on....you know LIKE SAVING OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY!!!  That important enough for ya?  ROTFL!

2516044,5,B000EBCJN6,"I have been a fan of the show ""24"" since the very beginning.  Each season they keep topping the last one.  And I didn't think it was possible to be better than Season 4.

How wrong I was.

This season has an amazing season premiere in which a couple of major characters are killed in the episode.  These deaths lead Jack Bauer to come out of hiding (he faked his death at the end of Season 4) and brings him back into the CTU fold to help find out who is behind the murders.

Then it goes up another notch when it is discovered that terrorists have acquired Sentox nerve gas and are threatening to release it if the President signs a terrorist bill along with the Russian president.  One of the cannisters ends up being released INSIDE of CTU, leading to the deaths of many civilians, including at least two more major characters.

Then it goes up yet another notch.

The rest of the season is dedicated to the retrieval of the deadly nerve gas, as well as the shocking discovery as to the discovery of who is behind the day's events.  Truly a season that keeps you grippeed from beginning to end.

This season brings out some of the most impressive acting I have ever seen.  Keifer Sutherland shows every range of emotion this season, an especially telling moment when he is briefly reunited with his daughter, Kim.  And the other major standout is Jean Smart, who plays the First Lady.  She is considered paranoid and mentally unstable.  And she plays her part to perfection.  Chloe also has a much larger role, and the viewer gets a glimpse into her personal life, as well as her past.  She also shines this season.

Any fan of ""24"" doesn't need to read this to know how great this season was.  Anyone who is uncertain about this show will be completely amazed.  Be it for the acting, the suspense, the great storyline, this season has it all.

2516048,2,B000EBCJN6,"[WARNING...major spoiler!!!!]I have bought all 5 seasons of the DVDs and I got hooked on it. Being a 24 fan, after watching season 5, I am compelled to write a review on this season. I agree that for this season, the drama and action scenes are one of the best on TV , but season 5's story line is way too far fetched!! I just don't think a conspiracy to THAT magnitude can ever happen in the White House, especially involving the US president himself ??!!! Somewhere in the middle of the season 5, I just lost my connection with the lawlessness, indecency and corruption of the (fictional) US government and the Oval Office.

I like Kiefer Sutherland (Jack Bauer) and I think he has done a great job acting out his part. I just hope that whoever wrote 24 will give this poor guy a break...he seems to be invincible or immortal or something.  Broke a rib in the morning but could still take out terrorists, escape perimeters, hijack planes, gain strangers' trusts, organize a coup against the president, point a gun at Logan's head AND manage to flirt with his girlfriend??? Don't take me wrong, I do enjoy the drama...I just think having some realism will be good here! If one guy can do everything, why do we even have FBI, CIA, ""CTU"", Homeland Security, Secret Service, DOD???? Might as well, he should BE the president of the United States...

-Favorite characters: Chloe, Secret Service Aaron Pierce.

-Annoying characters: Kim Bauer

In general, I like season 5, but I definitely do not enjoy this season as much as I did for the previous seasons, when they used to stick with pure terrorism plots which were a bit more plausible.",1167696000,4,1636,4.608247422680412
2516049,5,B000EBCJN6,"24 is the most intense and entertaining TV show that I have seen.  Season Five is the best one yet.

Assassination, Murder, Mayhem, Setups, Hijacking, Treason, and Treachery are all in this season of 24.  Most of them make an appearance in the first two hours and it just gets better from there.

This show has more twists and turns in one episode than most programs do in a whole season.  The acting and casting is also excellent.

For those who have never seen 24, it is a tough call.  The show is very addictive.  One might be better off to not ever start with it.  On the other hand, it is highly entertaining.  If you have not seen it before, I would recommend starting off at the beginning of season one and going from there.  It would really help with the background for this season.  If one does not want to consume that much time on it, I think that this season would probably do pretty well as a  stand alone also.",1167696000,,924,4.271676300578035

(2) No silly sideline stories (cougar/CTU baby/CTU head's unstable daughter). It never strays from the focussed, gripping story.

(3) The acting is the best yet, especially Logan and his wife together (check out the subtle body language, even hand wringing and facial twitches at critical moments!).

(4) The music is racheted up several notches to enhance the heart-pounding story.

(5) Kim makes a minimum of appearances.

(6) The political intrigue combined with the terror threat is the best yet.

(7) Implicating top government officials into the terror threat has you asking ""how can Jack possibly stop them?""

(8) The killer first episode has you screaming at the TV in disbelief! Although some folks may disagree, killing off some key actors was necessary, and was a perfect transition from Season 4. One trademark of this show is that it doesn't get stale. It pushes the envelope.

(9) The final haunting ending to Day 5 has us counting down the hours to Day 6.

2516051,5,B000EBCJN6,"The shocking opening moments of the fifth season of 24 literally blew away everything that we've come to know about the show.  Alliances are challenged, close friends are lost--all the while Jack Bauer tries to keep his sanity and find out who the real culprit is behind one of the most trying days in American history.

The cast is perfect, the storyline is compelling, and the action is never ceasing.  This season had by far the most suspense as well as the most cliff hangers.  After I finished watching an episode, I usually wanted to go right to the next and watch it right away!  There is, however, a big plot hole in the season.  The fate of Evelyn Martin and her daughter was never covered, and I found that unfair; an entire episode depicted their plight, and I feel it should have been resolved, whether she was killed or left alive by Henderson.

Any show that can make a person sympathize with someone while viciously rooting against them (i.e. Logan) is a stupendous show.  24 delivers all of that and more, with its best season to date.

2516052,3,B000EBCJN6,"I break my rating down as follows:

- Drama and acting = 5 stars

- Politics = 1 star

- Realism = 3 stars

Overall = 3 stars

After watching Season 4 of ""24"", I was expecting more of the same: the portrayal of the REAL terrorist threat (i.e. Islamist terrorists). Instead, [warning: spoiler coming up, so if you have not watched 24 Season 5 yet, you might want to stop reading here, because I am about to give away some plot lines] what we get is a typical Hollywood rendition of who the ""real terrorists are"" (i.e. within our own government). Needless to say, this has never happened before, and thus I found it a bit unrealistic. Who are the real terrorists in our world, FOX ? Is it the ""Neo-conservatives"" who ""want to control oil"", or is it maybe Muslim groups who want to destroy anything not on their primitive, medieval, fascist level ?

Don't get me wrong, Season 5 is great drama. The acting, plot, tempo, etc. is all first-rate, and on that level, I could enjoy it.

I didn't like the typical leftwing Hollywood politics though. For me, Fox and 24 took a step back from hard-hitting realism, evident in season 4, and have gone back to ""safer"" leftwing Hollywood politics.

A couple notes on realism:

- The idea that Chloe can basically hack into any network within 10 minutes, past all firewalls, is really just laughable.

- In one scene, Bauer racks back his Glock handgun to threaten someone, so that it is essentially half locked back (and you can see the round). To anyone who knows anything about handguns, that means that his Glock won't fire (it is either locked back, i.e. out of ammo, or is in a FTF - failure to fire, basically a jam, with the round locking the slide back. His gun cannot fire in that state !! I expected a bit more from ""24"" than that). I have seen unrealistic handgun use throughout ""24"". In many scenes, someone will slam in a magazine and then not rack the slide. In that state, the gun cannot fire ! It might seem unimportant, but to those of us who have actually fired a handgun, it looks funny.

- CTU obviously can torture people at will in their special ""interrogation room"". And this in Los Angeles. I found this to be just a bit ""much"".

- CTU is obviously VASTLY more advanced than the real CIA and FBI and Homeland Security. In contrast to the real FBI, which still is using - to this day - computers and networks from 1978, CTU is integrated with every network on the planet and can hack in at will. The real FBI ""lost"" 400 laptop computers (along with 700 handguns !!!!), and has computer systems which are not integrated with each other, and which cannot exchange data (!). At the CIA, they watch CNN for news of what is going on. CTU in contrast, is absolutely cutting edge. There are many political firewalls built between the FBI and CIA (thanks Ted Kennedy and John Kerry and all the liberals !) which are not reflected in ""24"". In addition, the FBI and CIA are not organizations rife with evil ""neo-conservatives"" who want to take over. The FBI and CIA are full of patriotic Americans who get up every day and serve our nation. I find the notion that our own government is a hive of potential traitors to be really repugnant, but unfortunately, we see this kind of thing constantly from Hollywood and the media (I expected more from FOX).

I still can recommend ""24"", but the politics and some aspects of realism are getting on my nerves. The acting and drama side is absolutely first-rate, however, so I give it 3 stars.",1167609600,2,3483,4.448979591836735

Kiefer Sutherland continues to impress with is acting abilities on the show.  The writers of the show continue to make political statements intelligently, as well as keeping the story engaging from start to finish.

I particularly liked the underlying political conspiracy theme: a very contemporary angle to the story. Also interesting the usual power struggles between CTU and the various players  from the other agencies. Keither Sutherland did an outstanding job as usual as Jack Bauer, as if had been born just to play this role. And my second favorite was the actress that plays Chloe. In fact she carries a lot of the season, providing some very amusing moments with her quirky character.

Overall 24, with its one hour per episode formula, manages to still provide nail biting action and drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.

Season 5 starts out with finding out where Jack is and has been for the past 18 months, while the rest of the world believes him to be dead.  As would be expected, that situation doesn't last long.  After some shocking events, Jack is brought back to CTU to handle the latest threat - and learn who is behind the death of someone close to him.  Where Season 5 starts out and where it ends up, is as usual the best rollercoaster that television has to offer.  You won't be disappointed.  We watched the entire season in a matter of just over a week, watching a few episodes every night.

The DVD extras are interesting too - the Season 6 prequel hits with you a surprise of its own at the end.  The ""Supporting Characters"" extra is full of interesting interview bits with the actors.  The 100th Episode Reel is a collage of the seasons to date - it is interesting to watch just for the sheer amazement of how much has happened and changed in just five seasons.

2516068,5,B000EBCJN6,"When the producers of 24 sat down to pen the beginning of the fifth longest day of Jack Bauer's life, they found themselves facing quite a quandary. They had faked Bauer's death in the finale of the fourth season, so they now had to figure out how to bring him out of hiding. The answer must've seemed painfully simple and obvious on paper; just kill off not one, but two main characters who were close to Jack. Simple maybe in it's conception, but the execution lead to a season that was anything but simple. Rather, it resulted in one of the best, most cohesive seasons of this intense series to date. In fact, this season was so good that it finally won both Kiefer Sutherland and the entire show Emmy Awards that were long overdue. From the shocking opening minutes of the first hour, to the grim and chilling last seconds in the finale, this season never lets up in its presentation of the roller coaster ride that makes 24 such a blast to watch.

Jack is flung full throttle into action once again when it seems that the people who helped him cover up his flight from the Chinese government appear to be targets for death. As Jack plunges headlong into this day, he faces down a group of renegade Russian separatists who are intent on destroying a new alliance between the U.S. and Russia. But the terrorists are only the surface problem, for as Jack digs deeper to find those responsible for murder, he finds that his greatest enemies lie within his own government.

Long-time fans of this series wondered what we would possibly do without the likes of David and Sherry Palmer to keep things interesting, but the fifth season gave us the unmistakable answer in the wonderfully compelling characters of President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) and his on-edge wife, Martha (Jean Smart.) As the conspiracy unfolds, the story of the president and first lady equal the harrowing exploits of Jack.

Also brought back for another hellish day are fan favorites such as Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard), Chloe O'Brian (Mary Lynn Rajskub), Bill Buchanan (James Morrison), and Wayne Palmer (DB Woodside), among others. This is also a season when former minor players get to take center stage, such as the ambiguous Mike Novick (Jude Ciccolella), and soft-spoken Secret Service Agent Aaron Pierce (Glenn Morshower.) As is always the case with each new season of 24, new characters are introduced who make their mark as well. Memorable introductions this year include another prickly CTU boss played by Sean Astin, and an ex CTU agent played to the hilt by Peter Weller, who may serve as the best nemesis for Jack since the days of Nina Myers.

Like the third and fourth season box sets, the fifth season DVD set is loaded with wonderful extra features that go unrivaled in TV circles. The most notable of these is an exclusive prequel for the sixth season, which is by far the most useful prequel we've had since the concept was introduced two years ago. The behind-the-scenes documentaries are as interesting as ever and I was particularly touched by the nostalgia of the mile-marker reel for the 100th episode, along with the personal insights into some of the cast members. The music of 24 has never been better and I enjoyed Sean Callery's insights into how he makes this portion of the show so integral. I also appreciated the new packaging on this set, as it makes the disks more manageable.

All and all, this is a superb season of 24 and should not disappoint any viewer, though I don't recommend watching it without having viewed prior seasons. Beware, squeamish adults, for the death toll this time around is exceptionally high. Still, as is always the case with 24, the thrills are well worth the price.",1165795200,8,3706,4.73953488372093

2516070,5,B000EBCJN6,"""24"" is like Red Bull--once you've had it you're addicted. The fifth season of ""24"" revolves around one central mystery: who killed an ex-president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the assassination? It's a thrilling season--probably the best since the first season--and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007. Interestingly after having watched ""Casino Royale"" its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like ""24"" which were, in turn, inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there. There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you haven't seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.

As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD. This also features a brief episode ""prequel"" to the sixth season like previous sets had. We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland. There's also a summary of the season included as well athough if you've watched the show (or are watching it now) it won't really provide anything new. Th ""100 Episode Reel"" is a pretty useless extra -- basically a clips compilation.

Different places are offering different exclusives. If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox (at least during the Holidays) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show. Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show, a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show, a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes. I haven't had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really, really good.

This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging. This is a terrific set for an outstanding season of the series. What I would love to see if Keifer Sutherland and Donald Sutherland featured during a season.",1165449600,9,2300,4.803030303030303

My only problem is slight - the box is very different. Although I like how the discs are MUCH easier to access, the packaging doesn't sit well with the previous seasons. The box is half the width.

The main thing I loved about the old packaging were the great fold outs which had really great photo's of the cast. Flipping those out, seeing the pictures, it got me ready to watch the episodes. Sounds silly, but they were nice.",1165276800,5,604,4.234782608695652
2516072,5,B000EBCJN6,"In the aftermath of season 4, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) had to fake his own death and go into hiding.  But he can't seem to stay in retirement for long.  Someone knows Jack is alive and targets his friends, forcing Jack to come out of hiding to face down terrorists yet again.

Meanwhile, it is an important day for the United States and President Logan (Gregory Itzin).  He has been working hard to iron out an anti-terrorism treaty with Russia, and that treaty will be signed that day.  But the treat of terrorists in Los Angeles with stolen nerve gas just might be enough to derail the treaty.

Season 5 won an Emmy for best drama, and it was well deserved.  Even after five years, this show is gripping drama with excellent writing and acting.  I am glued to my seat every week, breathing only during commercial breaks.  This season the threat and storytelling seemed more focused then previous years, adding to the drama.

There were a couple flaws this season.  I sure don't remember the explanation of who knew Jack was alive at the beginning of the season.  Maybe it was mentioned and I missed it.  Furthermore, we have yet more examples of lack of security at CTU.  While it does make for gripping drama, it does seem like they could come up with a new plot trick every so often.

My biggest complaint this season was the body count.  We lost several key characters from previous years.  While I understand the producer's desire to keep us on the edge of our seats, can't anyone from the show live happily ever after?  It honestly got to the point I dreaded seeing anyone who had been on the show before for fear they would be killed off.

Still, these are minor issues with a truly wonderful show.  I'm counting down the hours until the next season premiers and we can start the rush all over again.",1165276800,9,1814,4.506134969325154

I do like the packaging on this set better.  It doesn't flip out like the other cases but are packaged in thin plastic cases.  The external case looks smaller sitting next to season 1-4.

It just gets better and better. If you are taping it. Forget it. If you miss one moment of this show you will be very very disappointed. It is amazing.

2516076,5,B000EBCJN6,"Prior to season five I believed seasons 1 and 2 to be the best.  Seasons 3 and 4 were dissappointing.  Then came season five.  The key feature of season five is how a single threat keeps you suspended for the entire season.  Season five is more coherent and organized then seasons 3 and 4.  It had a more real sense to it, just like the first two seasons.  Season three did have several major characters killed off, but it didn't match the way season five did it.  Besides we were getting tired of Nina Myers and Sherry Palmer and welcomed those deaths.  However, the killing of David Palmer and Tony Almeida were not expected and not welcomed.  With Jack, those two characters I would say made the backbone of 24.  The negative effect of this is that the creators now have to fill in the void left by their deaths.  Tony can be replaced by Curtis and David by his brother, but it has to be done right.  Finally I feel that President Logan is probably the best ""villian"" in 24 history.  I hope he has another major role in season six.",1164499200,5,1034,4.322916666666667

Nothing I've seen this year compares to this show except maybe United 93 and Mi:III. Still, this show is better than those two. From the first episode where the shocking twists and turns of the fates of our favorite characters all the way to the Russians stealing nerve gas and attacking CTU all the way to the traitorship of President Charles Logan and awesome finale, this show was right on the money. Even though Mi:3 was good, 24 keeps the action and suspense up all the way from start to finish. Season 4 was great and tense but this year's season and may I mention the EMMY AWARD WINNING SEASON OF 2006, blew my socks off as what to expect. No one is safe.

2516086,5,B000EBCJN6,"""24"" is quite simply the greatest show to appear on television in a good long while and season five is its finest hour.  Five seasons in, series creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran continue to spring one unpredictable surprise after another, sending super agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland, by equal turns lethally charismatic and emotionally bruised) against his most formidable foes yet that include everyone and anyone from Russian Separatists, authoritarian double agents to high ranking members of the government.  Fans of the season will know exactly who these baddies are, but for those unitiated, the head-spinning surprises are best left unsaid.  What can be said, is that for this fifth season the crack writing staff took a good hard look at the state of geopolitics and the authoritarian neo-conservatism championed by the Bush administration and worked in a cautionary tale about oil-lust and hubris taken to extremes.  Besides Sutherland, special recognition has to go to Gregory Itzin as the weak-kneed President Logan, Jean Smart as the harried first lady and Mary Lynn Rajskub as the nerdy Chole O'Brien. For the show, this season presented a tricky balancing act between the shows' signature slam-bang action scenes (there are still spectacular) and the sobering political commentary, but Surnow and Cochran nail it, making ""24"" a thinking man's thriller that is far smarter and far more relevant than anything else on television.",1161907200,59,1454,5.308695652173913

And I must say, over 5 seasons later, I still consider this show a must watch. Now, there have been many shows that have come about that I would call ""flatterers by imitation"", some of which are also some of my favorite shows...""Lost"", ""Prison Break"" and ""Heroes"" to name a few.

Comes day 5 to demonstrate that things cannot always get better - as Jack comes back from the presumed-dead to face an immense loss and immediately continue to save a nation from formidable new enemies - foreign and domestic.

At its fifth season the show is interesting, vibrant, energetic and possibly better than previous seasons; ""24"" is still in its development phase - it appears that there's a lot more to do and tell in the future - and it's admirable to be able to say that about a series at the point where most other TV shows are long beyond their glory days.

2516099,5,B000EBCJN6,"For sheer intensity and plot topsy-turvies, no other show comes close to 24. You'd think the premise (every hour of the 24 episode-long season is played in real-time; thus 24 encapsulates a full day) would get old by now, but, surprisingly, the producers and writers have managed to come up with another riveting, must-see season. In fact, this might be the best season of them all. The thrills and nail-biting suspense (as well as the SPOILERS alert) begin early in the season five opener, with the shocking slaying of President Palmer and assassination attempts on familiar CTU agents (one of which is tragically successful). Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is lured out of hiding after 18 months and becomes rapidly embroiled in a devious conspiracy that goes all the way up to the White House. As he becomes the most wanted man in America (he is framed for Palmer's assassination), he must try to ferret out the true culprit(s) and again save the country from deadly Russian extremists and various domestic villains. On a personal level, he must come to terms with the deaths of personal friends, the alienation of his daughter Kim, and the fact that his former girlfriend  Audrey Raines (Kim Raver) might have moved on.

There's a reason why Kiefer won the best dramatic actor Emmy and why 24 beat out the likes of the West Wing, the Sopranos, Grey's Anatomy, and House for best drama. The fifth season is fully serviced by a coming together of story and acting - from the gripping, edge-of-your-seat plot line, with its manic twists and turns, to the no-quarters-given, full speed ahead performances of the cast, but specially of Kiefer Sutherland, who gives his all in inhabiting his role. Kiefer IS the show and consistently produces such driven intensity, lying just beneath an icy cold surface, and yet his eyes reveal a vulnerability of sorts, when he's reacting to something personal to him. He makes a scene work, even without dialogue. Very good stuff. And, no, you do not want to get in the way of Jack Bauer.

There are other standouts, of course. Gregory Itzin as the shifty and weak-willed U.S. President makes you gleefully hiss, while Jean Smart as the medicated First Lady Martha Logan brings earnest soap-opera acting to primetime. Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O'Brian) continues her highlight role as CTU's brilliant but cantankerous and socially-inept tech support operative. Meanwhile, James Morrison, Roger Cross, Kim Raver, Carlos Bernard, Louis Lombardi, and Sean Astin become the season's dependable, solid bedrock.

That so many of the regular cast die in this season lends an immediacy to the episodes and exponentially raises the stakes. There's no comfort level at all here, as you're never sure who would survive in the end (but, with this show, were you ever sure?). Even Kiefer Sutherland had played around with the idea of having Jack Bauer biting the dust (Please, no!).

So, the 24 - Season Five dvd box releases December 5, 2006, just in time for you to go thru 'em to prep for season six, which begins next January on Fox. Season Six, by the way, picks up nearly two years after season five's finale and will have James Cromwell with a recurring role as Jack's estranged dad, Phillip Bauer. Also joining the cast is Eddie Izzard, Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle), Peter MacNicol, Regina King, and the beautiful Rena Sofer. I can't wait to own season five and, then, to see season six. Long live Jack Bauer!",1159660800,13,3454,4.857385398981324
2516100,5,B000EBCJN6,"Revel in his awesomeness!!! For he is a god amongst men and he is deserving of all praise that can possibly be heaped upon him. The one time the Emmys got something right!! Jack Bauer is as close as any fictional character has become to being superhumanly powerful, and at some times his recurrent circumvention of the bureaucratic system, assaulting his friends and co-workers, his flagrant abuse of ""prisoner's rights"" and his uncanny ability to fight his way out of any trap... it may require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than would normally be necessary in a lesser show, but the very core of this show is Jack Bauer, or more specifially, Kiefer Sutherland and his increasingly better performance each season of 24. When he is having a particularly emotional moment, you feel it exude from the screen.... this is just an example of the power that Sutherland brings to this show. Also standing out as always is Mary Lynn Rasjkub as the wonderfully ascerbic and wicked-tongued Chloe O'Brien. The introduction of her character is one of the best things that's happened to this show. But this season has some other stand-out characters: one that was introduced in season 4 and a brand new one. Fans of the show know these as President Charles Logan (the wonderfully slimy Gregory Itzin) and his first lady Martha Logan (the amazing Jean Smart). Their interplay and their performances are almost as key as Sutherland in this season. Another thing that came to be almost an in-joke is that three members of the cast of the original ROBOCOP film appear in different parts of the series, which as a fan of that film was just really cool to see. Whether or not that was intended, it's still a nice touch for genre fans. Julian Sands has lots of fun chewing up scenery as the evil Russian-yet-English-Accented Terrorist. The premise is per usual: Jack must defy all odds to save the country and avenge his personal losses. But the plot itself is of a higher level of complexity and tragedy this season than prior seasons. The way it begins is ALMOST as shocking as the way the season ends. And the ending of the final episode of the season... that scream you heard in the whole of the United States and parts of Canada and Mexico... that was me.

By now, we already know how ultra-ultimate Jack Bauer is, so instead I'll talk about the story that takes 24 to its peak -- the marriage of President Charles Logan and First Lady Martha Logan.  Gregory Itzin (President Logan) and Jean Smart (the First Lady) are two of the finest actors you will ever see in your life; together they take the husband-wife relationship to a level rarely seen in drama -- you know I'm talking about Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf', but also Albert Finney and Vanessa Redgrave as Winston and Clementine Churchill in 'The Gathering Storm.'

How good are Itzin and Smart?  I don't know where to begin: Did Itzin drink rattlesnake blood to prepare for his role?  No corny James Bond supervillain can compare to the terrifying prospect of the President of the United States deploying all his power as traitor/serial killer!  Itzin portrays the President as morally vacant -- totally! -- and running blind on pure snake instinct.  Satan himself is taking notes!  And Jean Smart!  She brought me to tears with the power of her performance, as she overcomes her deep emotional and alcohol problems to literally save American democracy.  We'd already seen Martha Logan's gut-wrenching courage when she puts her life on the line (Jack Bauer-style!) to save the visiting Russian President from assassination.  The climactic scene when the First Lady brings down her husband is off-the-charts -- as good as it gets in acting.  The look of triumph on her face when President Logan realizes she has outsmarted and defeated him is priceless.

Looking back from 2018, there is a lot of prescient irony in 24 Season 5.  (I won't get into a comparison between President Logan and you know who.)  Kate Mara, the sex kitten from the #MeToo'd Kevin Spacey's 'House of Cards', has a cameo as a 'Zero Tolerant' ""victim"" of unwanted shoulder rubs.  At one point, one character says that the whole conspiracy will collapse like a ""House of Cards"" -- kind of like Kevin Spacey's career!  But most #MeToo of all: For all the ultimate macho ultra-masculinity of Jack Bauer, in the end, only the First Lady can bring down the monster President Logan.",1521072000,,2233,4.943699731903485
