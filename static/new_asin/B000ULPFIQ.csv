8213755,3,B000ULPFIQ,"The movie is based on the idea that ""Treasure Island"" was not fictional. This was discovered by two different people about the same time who battle for the treasure.

Randy Quaid leads a group of kooky pirates who have to compete with the inept owner/operators of a kids' camp. The acting is pure ham. The kids are stereotyped into impossible characters. The script is bad and filled with slap stick and low brow humor including a horse with a gas problem.

As always in kids movies, adults are stupid and kids must save the day. This film will work well with kids with a low maturity level, say under tweens, but would never be a good movie for teens or adults. Robert Louis Stevenson is rolling over in his grave.",1343606400,,715,4.492307692307692

8213758,3,B000ULPFIQ,"Our kids watched this without me and then said, ""It's stupid.  Well, actually, it's kind of funny.""  Then when I said I'd watch it myself, they sat down to watch it again with me.
If you're a fan of Treasure Island movies, this will be number 4 on your top 3.  Best if you can borrow it from someone or from the library but still worth watching...once.",1263600000,,352,4.223880597014926
8213759,4,B000ULPFIQ,"A clever tale for kids of all ages, filled with adventure, suspense, and a wackiness that only Moe, Larry, and Curly could match!  Randy Quaid is great as the snarling pirate!  yaaaarrr!",1196208000,7,186,4.78125
8213760,5,B000ULPFIQ,"I watched this film, and loved it, it's clever, funny, imaginative and touching - a great film for both kids and their parents. This film would make a great Chrismas present or stocking stuffer - a must see!",1196208000,4,207,4.473684210526316
