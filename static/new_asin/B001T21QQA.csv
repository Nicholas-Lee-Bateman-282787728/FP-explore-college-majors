8340357,3,B001T21QQA,"first of all the reason I gave it four stars is because Im not to thrilled with the remarks [just-kiding] but really I would understand
that the low star raitings were for a good reason, okay the real reason that I gave it four stars is because there were a few understandable parts I could relate to, first was the two kids childhood made a good sence, but was not to thrilled with the whole getting back together thing after the shoot out between them, they kind of made look like a misunderstanding which didn't work at all didn't like the main actor that much though did not think he did that well, probably the only good thing about the movie was it had a rap star theme to it, but its worth whatching probly oce in a while depnding on what you thought of it.",1262131200,2,764,4.239726027397261

8340359,1,B001T21QQA,"Wow -- what to say: a laughably bad film! Poor performances (mainly from the lead character -- most others are okay), weak script, mediocre music, the usual clich&eacute;s for the genre, corny dialogue, dull and dragging storyline, amateurish cinematography, etc. My son and I had a good time laughing our way through this one; it's funny for all the wrong reason. My theory about such projects is this: an audience is willing to overlook a low-budget effort (such as this one), as long as the film's script and the acting is tight (unlike this one). You'll inevitably question how the lead actor was chosen for the part -- did somebody owe him money, big time!!! I'll conclude by saying something positive: the film is well-intentioned -- no doubt all those involved meant well, despite how overwhelmingly inept they were in every possible way. I'd skip this one if I were you.",1252713600,,878,4.821192052980132
