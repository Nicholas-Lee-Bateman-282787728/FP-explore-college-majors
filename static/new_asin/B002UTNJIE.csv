8381542,4,B002UTNJIE,A good continuation to the original saga with all characters now 2 years older.  Action and storyline are interesting and keep you eager for answers.  Only thing that bothered me is that the plots are drawn out a bit too long and sometimes makes you wonder how much you could have saved if this is was not done.  On the flip side is that the series would have been shorter and the studio would have sold less DVD's.,1269475200,,415,4.294871794871795
