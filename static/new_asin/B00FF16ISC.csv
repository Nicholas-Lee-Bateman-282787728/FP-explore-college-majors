8615084,5,B00FF16ISC,"The quality of the DVD is good, the subtitles are clear and accurate. The story itself is basically a one a day drama. Each episode has a new case with Tokage solving the mystery and usually aiding the cops nab the bad guy. Towards the end of the drama every case seems to be connected to the infamous ""spider"". The whole drama is Tokage trying to deal with his survivors guilt and to learn the truth about his partners death. The drama isn't perfect it has it's missteps and the last few episodes seem stuffed with info all at once. Like the writers forgot how many episodes they had and went OH NO we have two left and all this drama! haha. It is still a good show and worth the watch if you are a fan of cop dramas.",1456617600,,718,4.135714285714286
8615085,4,B00FF16ISC,"Once a cop, now a private detective with ""skillz"", who is caretaker for the fatherless boy of his former partner (who died in the line of duty, while Shota's character survived a murder attempt), we have various tales of ""The Lizard"" solving cases the police call him in to handle. At the same time, the murder of his partner is a serious issue (emotionally, and the ""who ordered it"" still unsolved). The Lizard works on each week's case while still working to find out who the Big Baddie is who changed his life.

Matsuda is fabulously hot in his assymetrical cut and trim outfits. Not every episode works perfectly and some situations seem downright silly, but I still enjoyed some of the cases and his ultimate solving of the puzzle and past tragedy that haunts him. Definitely one for Matsuda fans--just love that hairstyle on him. :D He's a delight.",1397433600,,854,4.693333333333333
