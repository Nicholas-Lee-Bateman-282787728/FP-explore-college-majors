2489296,5,B000E4C2TY,"I hate working out. but for some reason, i can handle this 20 minute. I have been doing it for a year and results are there. and once it is part of routine, it is doable.
now if i would eat better.",1297641600,7,197,3.7142857142857144
2489297,5,B000E4C2TY,I have been using this 20 minute dvd for the past 9 years.  If you do it on a regular basis (4 times a week or so) you will see results in about 3 months.  This is my go to exercise routine.  I do fall off the exercise wagon but go back to this dvd to get back into shape.  After three kids and three C-sections it does flatten my abs and tone the rest of my body.  I hate to exercise but this works when you have a busy schedule just 20 minutes a day several times a week.  You will see results!  My husband has used it and it helped him lose his belly.  I love this DVD and will continue to use it.  Thanks Mari for making a DVD that works in such a short time.  You'll sweat and it is difficult at first but gets easier and in just 20 minutes sessions. This is good for those who hate to run (me)or be out of breath.  It slims your body from your core (belly) out to your legs and butt.  Does not work on arms but it will transform the rest of your body to be firm and lean.  Like a dancer's body.  I will never get rid of this dvd.  LOVE IT!!!,1277856000,21,1047,3.76036866359447
2489298,5,B000E4C2TY,this video is great. i can do it before work so even if i can't make it to the gym in the afternoon then i still feel like i have done something!!,1260144000,8,146,3.59375
2489299,5,B000E4C2TY,"I always get results when I use Pilates. I would recommend only WINDSOR PILATES  because I have heard that other types don't work. But, I see result within days. I work out allot and eat healthy so, that makes a difference too.",1257033600,3,227,4.404761904761905

2489301,5,B000E4C2TY,I love Mari's Pilates routines. They are calming and relaxing while really giving you a good workout. I feel it the minute I stand up even though none of the moves really seem that strenuous.,1238371200,4,191,4.485714285714286
2489302,3,B000E4C2TY,"Winsor Pilates is now a well known brand, because of the infomercials and the availability of their products, so you can do Pilates at home.

This DVD includes an instructional video, where Mari Winsor shows the moves herself and explains the basic ideas behind Pilates, and a 20-minute workout, where she leads a class composed of some of her instructors.

The instructional video is well made, with the exercises well performed and well explained. The 20-minute workout is so-so. It's a good workout, and can give good results, but I don't think it's well designed.
Some of the exercises included are normally considered Advanced exercises and not recommended for beginners by Pilates instructors. The reason is that without the proper core strength and experience that comes from practicing Pilates for a while, a beginner can easily get injured by performing the exercise wrong and/or with the wrong positioning.
The exercises are effective when properly performed, but for some it may be a shot in the dark. To avoid that, I would recommend taking lessons with a Pilates instructor or practicing first with one of the many good instructional Pilates books - Brooke Siler's is excellent, and Jillian Hessel's is good too.",1197417600,15,1225,5.08955223880597

2489311,4,B000E4C2TY,"This workout, led by well-known Pilates instructor Mari Winsor, is included in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winsor-Pilates-Basic-Workout-Set/dp/B00077BD7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winsor Pilates Basic Workout Set</a>. Winsor instructs a live class of five background exercisers, walking around teaching rather than performing the moves herself. One of the background exercisers shows modifications. This routine is appropriate for beginners who have at least some prior knowledge of Pilates, as Winsor provides only minimal instruction when introducing each new move.

The workout begins with several warm-up moves such as the Pilates Hundred, the Roll-Up, Leg Circles, and Rolling like a Ball.  Winsor then moves the group through the classic Series of 5 (Single Leg Stretch, Double Leg Stretch, Single Stretch Leg Stretch, Leg Lowers, and Criss Cross).  Following this, they stretch with Spine Stretch Forward and the Saw.  Next comes the Side Kick Series, including Front-Back, Up-Down, Bicycles, and Scissors.  This routine concludes with the Seal.

This workout clocks in at 22 minutes, providing a nice, shorter Pilates routine option.  The indoor setting and rote instruction from Winsor are a bit on the bland side, but still, I would recommend this DVD.",1412380800,,1314,6.147540983606557

I was a little dissapointed to begin with because i didn't look to see that it was a VHS before i ordered it but then realizing even then, that they didn't send the right product at all, even a bigger dissapointment. Anyways, it didn't cost enough for me to worry about having to return it so im just going to keep it and maybe try it out someday..we will see.",1392940800,,632,4.064

(It only says it in a small print of format, not in the larger title or description)I ordered it and realized it was not what I wanted, I contacted seller to see if I could exchange it for a DVD, no big deal right? well their first response was  ""We have DVD but the price is much higher than VHS. This is really your fault."" Wow, how abrasive is that? Final response was just ""dvd is much more expensive"" and gave return address. Never told me how much for dvd or if and how to do an exchange. I found it cheaper with a seller with 99% satisfaction.",1356307200,3,615,4.040983606557377
2489340,2,B000E4C2TY,so the step by step guide it more of a visual dictionary of pilates poses than it is a step by step follow along guide. i had planned to use this post pregnancy to gently rebuild my muscles but the step by step guide cannot be followed like a class and the 20 min routine is not a beginner level though there are modifications that look good if one has injuries or is in a pretty bad starting place and needs to take it pretty easy. i wanted something slower placed not nesc. easier. this was not it.,1348531200,,500,4.112244897959184
2489341,5,B000E4C2TY,"This is hands down the best pilates video ever! I have tried them all, and nothing compares to Windsor. At first, it seemed a bit difficult, but now it's a breeze. It really doesnt take long to see results, 2 to 3 weeks. I do follow a decent diet, nothing extreme, and work on the treadmill  an hour a day, and while all of that is helpful, nothing kicked it up like this 20 minute pilates. I have the 3 set disk, but they are more difficult, and in my opinion, unless you are quite fit to begin with, they are a challenge. I always go back to the 20 min workout, I mean all of us have at least 20 minutes, and to work this quickly, you won't be sorry. I use this 5 to 7 times per week, although it states on the video 3x a week is fine. mari can be a bit annoying at times, but overall her intruction is very good, and the workout is not difficult, give it a try, worth every dollar!",1345766400,,884,3.9385474860335195

Trying to strengthen there core and wanting to get more flexible.
I do the work out twice a day and I also strongly recommend the
Winsor pilates bun and thigh sculpting to compliment this work out.
I had  bursitis of the hip and it was painful. My doctor told me to take
Tylonal 3 times a day and rest. Instead I use these two DVD work outs and
The muscle around my hips is becoming stronger and more flexible with less pain.

2489347,5,B000E4C2TY,"I had lost my original copy of this, and I am thrilled to have been able to find a replacement. 20 minutes, and let me tell you...you feel it the next day. Even immediately after, assuming you really tried to do the moves instead of throwing yourself through them, you will feel it a bit. It takes a week or two for you to build the strength to do the moves at least somewhat smoothly, and a bit longer to be able to do them all very smoothly and properly. Once I reached that point, I stuck with it for a couple more weeks before moving on to the next level (which promptly kicked my butt for a week or two).

All in all, I do recommend this.",1310774400,,643,4.0234375

Unless you've already memorized the moves & mechanics. This is actually disc 1 & 2 of the set. The step-by-step on this disc is NOT mari telling you the mechanics & how-to-do-it's while it shows the gal doing the moves & the graphics. You get just text to read before a quick peak at the move & no talking for how to do it while you see the move. I feel gyped! I liked that part. It helped one learn moves because she talked while you tried it. As for the 20 minute workout. sure that's a good 4-5 star because it is the same as disc two of the set which i didn't need. i do like that workout but, if you want the step-by-step part WITH the talking while the moves are shown, get the 3 disc set again.",1452643200,,836,3.86046511627907
