155213,3,0792842154,"This film was done fine years before Roberto Begnini won an Academy Award for his performance in ""Life is Beautiful."" Roberto Begnini was unknown before to most audiences outside Italy. Roberto tries to capture the late Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau. The film also stars Pink Panther veterans like Claudia Cardinale, Herbert Lom, Burt Kwouk, etc.

The DVD is about ninety minutes of comedy. The film is no Oscar winner. When a princess is kidnapped in the South of France, Clouseau manages to get involved. The film's script is problematic but the comedy is pure slapstick. This film isn't kind of the film that makes you think much. It's a light hearted comedy.

Aside from the film, there are no extra features on the DVD.",1430265600,,728,4.862903225806452
155214,3,0792842154,"This is a pale imitation of the original Pink Panther series. Some of the original cast are in this one but their hearts do not seem to be in it. Without Peter Sellers they seem to only be doing this movie for the pay check. I thought Steve Martin's Pink Panther was weak, but at least that film had a comedian to hold it together. This Clouseau just seems like a bumbler.",1426377600,,372,4.180555555555555

155216,5,0792842154,"I liked SON OF THE PINK PANTHER immensely. To me it reverts to a style of comedy found in the original PINK PANTHER and A SHOT IN THE DARK. What is sad is that SON OF THE PINK PANTHER is just out of step for its time. I thought Roberto Benigni's performance was a hoot. He was perfect. It is a silly film and so were the originals. But this film has heart and an endearing quality to it. It was once again great to see Herbert Lom as Police Commisioner Charles Dreyfus, Burt Kwouk as Cato Fong,  Graham Stark playing Professor Auguste Balls and Claudia Cardinale playing Maria Gambrelli. The score was once again composed by Henry Mancini and he is even seen in the film's credits. I believe this was his last cinematic score. At the helm of it all was Blake Edwards once more a his final time. There is just something very nostalgic about SON OF THE PINK PANTHER. I like it. I think it is a fine Panther Film.",1418083200,,910,4.2298850574712645

155218,5,0792842154,Funny slapstick!  I only wish Benigni had made a sequel.  This helped take the sting out of loosing Sellers.,1411516800,,108,4.631578947368421
155219,4,0792842154,"Benigni is as always hilarious in this film.  Being a Blake Edwards film it kept true to the PP format and was brilliantly silly (which perfectly suits Benigni), as opposed to just sadly slightly silly alla Steve Martin.  Also bringing back Claudia Cardinale from the original film was a pleasant surprise.  Overall It's great, I marked it down one star because there are a few times when Benigni (in my opinion) strays off character and seems not to be following the pronouncedly similar speech pattern used by his late father (Peter Sellers as the original Inspector Clueseou) which established the proof of his heredity early in the film.  Still supremely funny even if you've never seen any of the classic Pink Panthers.",1411344000,,724,4.909836065573771

155221,2,0792842154,"This movie looks like it started out as a serious attempt to revive the Pink Panther series, then in mid-stream everyone decided that it wasn't going to work out, so they just ended up going through the motions.

The story has the Pink Panther diamond stolen yet again, and put onto a case is a stumblebum young French policeman who is unaware that he is Inspector Jacques Clouseau's illegitimate son, his mother being Maria Gambrelli from ""A Shot In The Dark"".  The plot is thin and confusing and hokey (Dreyfus falling in love with Gambrelli?) and the laughs are few.  Robert Benigni, who plays the son, brings boyish enthusiasm to the role, but nobody else in the movie helps him.

The inherent problem with this movie is that Benigni is supposed to replace the Inspector Clouseau role.  But the idea of Jacques Clouseau was that his character was one who kept acting dignified and haughty no matter what pratfalls he went through; Benigni purposefully acts like a silly clown and the whole concept of Clouseau is spoiled.  The whole series just didn't work without Peter Sellers.",1403049600,2,1083,4.795698924731183
155222,2,0792842154,"Let's face it: no one can compare to Peter Sellers. But they could have done a better job in this movie. Benigni's clumsiness was way overdone, and the humor was just crude slapstick with no imagination, and totally lacking in the subtlety that made Peter Sellers' antics so hilarious. As one reviewer said, it was only Herbert Lom and Burt Kwok who held the movie together.",1397865600,4,374,4.681818181818182
155233,2,0792842154,"There were true moments of flashing humor, but on the whole the poor writing pulled down the skill of a very funny actor, Roberto Begnigni.  Glimpses of the former regulars from the series was also a fun.",1396742400,2,204,4.513513513513513
155234,5,0792842154,I love Roberto Benigni. He is one of the funniest man alive. As a Pink Panther he carries the Peter Seller torch very well.,1379462400,,123,4.166666666666667
155235,2,0792842154,"Note: I saw this movie for free via XFinity On Demand.

After Trail & Curse, it seems that Edwards still hadn't learnt his lesson, and went back to making another Pink Panther movie. Aside from the scenes with Herbert Lom, Robert Davi, the girl who played the Princess, Claudia Cardinale (for some reason replacing Elke Sommer) and the equally stupid Chief of Police, this movie bungles everything else. The plot is almost utter nonsense from beginning to end. And what is this nonsense of recasting actors from the previous films in different roles (Graham Stark playing Clouseau's inept assistant Hercule in A Shot In The Dark, a broken piano player/informant in Return Of The Pink Panther and taking over Harvey Korman's role from Revenge Of The Pink Panther & Curse Of The Pink Panther in this movie)? And that idiot playin Francois was no Andre M. Should have just mentioned that Francois had died, instead of recasting the part. Don't waste your time on this 92-minute piece of garbage.

Rated PG (violence).",1366675200,,1014,4.8895348837209305

155237,4,0792842154,"As a fan of the Pink Panther series, I do enjoy this one!  Even though the great Peter Sellers is not in this one, Blake Edwards transfers his slap stick style over to the Son Of The Pink Panther.  The movie starts out just like the other movies do and suddenly goes into the misadventures of the new Clouseau.  Roberto Benigni does a fine job as the Klutzy policeman and still gets the mystery solved.",1354233600,,402,4.333333333333333
155238,3,0792842154,"Like the title states, I'm mixed on this one. While Benigni is/was a good choice to play Clouseau's son, the story doesn't fit. A kidnapped princess and a plot about trying to overthrow the government of her country? Sounds a little heavy for a Panther film. Even the overuse of action scenes seem to be a little forced (though I will admit that the scene when the princess, Robert Davi's man looking henchwoman and Benigni are tangled up and biting each other was funny). I think they were trying a little too hard to be a James Bond film. At least they were trying to be original and the story does not overshadow Benigni's performance as the story in Curse did to Wass. Stated earlier, Benigni is funny as Clouseau's son, a favorite scene is when he keeps drinking the liquid while ""operating"" on Davi. Herbert Lom isn't quite as insane in this one as before and he definately doesn't try to kill Jacques as much, actually developing more of a liking to him than his father. Claudia Cardinale returns to the franchise as Maria Gambrelli (originally played by Elke Sommer in A Shot in the Dark) and even gets a little reference when she played Princess Dala in the original. Burt Kwouk and Graham Starke round out the Panther regulars and are still funny (Kwouk even getting another try at ""the freezer ploy"" from Return). I think the only reason Davi is in this one is because of his role in Licence to Kill and he does an admirable job. When they opened the film and showed his hench ""woman"" watching the princess on video, I was confused as to if that really was a woman. I'm sorry to be stuck on this but I was really confused. She sounded like a woman but she wasn't built like a woman. Mancini is again in the music department and does a much better job than the last two entries. And the Panther theme is again re-orchestrated with Bobby McFerrin, and it actually isn't that bad.",1254873600,,1888,4.475362318840579
155239,3,0792842154,"After the success, or rather lack thereof, of ""Curse of the Pink Panther"", Blake Edwards realized he had to accept that Peter Sellers was no more and that he still needed to bring the name Clouseau back into the franchise, even if it meant giving Sellers' classic character an illegitimate son.

Enter future Oscar winner Roberto Benigni, who would actually receive the exact opposite of an Oscar for this role.  He's clean-shaven, part Italian Jacques Gumbrelli Clouseau Jr., not mustached Jacques Clouseau, making this a new character and leaving Benigni to the type of humor that works for him.

Unfortunately, the humor doesn't work for the entire movie.  The movie moves almost completely away from the overdone routines of the rest of the series, but there are only a few laugh out loud scenes, with some small chuckles in between.  The biggest problem with the film, though, would have to be the plot.  Pink Panther plots have been mangled messes before, but never to this extent.  There's so much political intrigue and scandal involved that it's hard to figure out what anyone's motivation in, even during the climax.

Herbert Lom is back for his final performance as Chief Inspector Dreyfus, now more sane and subdued.  Burt Kwouk is also back reprising his reoccurring role as Kato, the late Clouseau's humble servant.  Disguise master Professor Balls, played in the most recent films by Harvey Korman, is now played by Graham Stark, a friend of Sellers who appeared in different roles in many of the films.  These performances almost make the movie feel like a valid part of the series.

Henry Mancini's score, as in all of the films, is the highlight, and Bobby McFerrin's performance of the theme music is perfect.  Especially when it provides the background for a battle between an animated Benigni and the famous Pink Panther cartoon character, racing around a live action concert hall.

But the bottom line, sadly, is that the plot's a mess and the film isn't as funny as the Peter Sellers classics, or even the previous entry sans-Sellers, ""Curse of the Pink Panther.""",1150243200,5,2086,4.922857142857143
155240,3,0792842154,"Funny in parts, but not up to the level of when Peter Sellers was playing Clouseau. Hebert Lom and Bert Kwok are the only actors that hold the movie together. The usual clumsiness was a

155241,5,0792842154,"I did see this movie and to be honest with you, the critics were a little too harsh. Cause, this movie was actually quite good. Basically, when a vacationing princess is kidnapped. It's up to Chief Inspector Dreyfus to find her. At first, Dreyfus doesn't have any luck. That is until he runs into the kidnappers, almost gets killed. But, is saved by a local bumbling police officer named Jacques. When Dreyfus stops by the local policeman's home and meets his mother. Dreyfus is shocked to learn that the policeman is the son of none other than Maria Gambrelli. (The woman from the movie ""A Shot in The Dark"").

So, I was so happy when Isaw that this was available on DVD. In this day and age of technology, it is completely unacceptable to produce a DVD with such poor sound quality. I don't know why it is, but I constantly had to raise and lower the volume. I have not had this problem with any other DVD, so this was a real disappointment for me. I bought this DVD for under $10 and I still say it isn't worth $5! The sound is horrible.

In my fifty years of enjoying movies, I've only actually walked out of the theater before the end three times.  This is one of the movies.  Roberto Benigni is horrible.  Admittedly, I don't find him funny at all.  I have seen about six of his films and each time I fail to find anything funny about this guy.  This movie will test even the true Benigni fan, however.  I can't remember one funny moment (in the hour I stayed).  I was so disappointed being such a fan of Peter Sellers and hoping that Edwards hadn't totally forgotten how to be funny.

155256,3,0792842154,"Not a great comedy by any means but it's certainly not the worst of the Pink Panther series. The two films that preceeded this one are absolutely awful movies, and The Revenge Of The Pink Panther (the last film starring Peter Sellers when he was alive and kicking) was no great shakes either. In his last film as Clouseau (sorry, I'm not counting 'Trail'), Sellers was operating on autopilot, probably realising that these films no longer held any interest or challenge for him other than how best to spend his paycheque.
Unlike the two films before it, this film has something really special going for it...star Roberto Benigni. Rather than walking through his scenes like Sellers was apt to do when provided with less than challenging material, Benigni is overflowing with comic energy regardless of the drawbacks of the script. He dominates every scene he appears in...even when he doesn't have any lines he's always doing little bits of comic business that capture the viewers attention. When he's not onscreen the movie flatlines and doesn't come alive again until he reappears.
Another thing this film has going for it is the entertaining opening credits sequence featuring the Pink Panther and Jacques Clouseau Jr.-in animated form-interacting with Bobby McFerrin and his fellow singers performing a terrific acapella rendition of The Pink Panther Theme. The animation is far superior to anything seen since Richard Williams work on The Pink Panther Strikes Again and is reminiscent of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. It's a short sequence, but gets the movie off to a promising start.
However, the movie falters badly around the halfway mark when director Blake Edwards decides to once again incorporate supporting characters from previous films (he tried to prop up the previous two films by doing exactly the same thing, with dire results). Rather than introduce a new lead comic character and move forward, Clouseau Jr. is weighed down by the pointless reintroduction of characters from the Peter Sellers movies. The film stops dead in its tracks when Benigni visits costumer Auguste Balls (played by Graham Stark and not Harvey Korman, as in 'Trail') and meets Kato who joins Clouseau Jr. on his case. Herbert Lom also appears as Dreyfuss, but Lom is much more subdued in this film. The eye-twitching is still there, but he's no longer the gibbering headcase of the Sellers Clouseau films. He's the one returning element that works.
Forget about plot or story (I did!) as the only reason to see this film is for Benigni's wonderful performance. With a stronger script and less reliance on characters from the preceeding films, this film could have launched a new revitalised Pink Panther film series. Unfortunately Blake Edwards found it impossible to let go of the past, and the film became nothing more than an interesting curio as a result.",1058918400,9,2848,5.036016949152542
