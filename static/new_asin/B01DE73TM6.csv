8755652,5,B01DE73TM6,"We have all the DVDs from Dispatches from the Front so far, and every one is excellent.  The production values are high, and the documentaries are both challenging and inspiring.  I highly recommend this DVD and all the rest with no reservations!",1468627200,2,246,4.833333333333333
8755653,5,B01DE73TM6,"I do not appreciate all of the ""Dispatches"" videos equally, for various reasons, but this one on God's grace at work among the tribal peoples of NE Cambodia is excellent. It is true to fact, Bible-centered, and very encouraging. May God do such a work throughout the larger ethnic peoples of SE Asia as well for His glory.",1466035200,3,322,4.568965517241379
8755654,5,B01DE73TM6,"Another great adventure by Frontline Missions.  Tim's narrative is always thought-provoking.  You get a great sense of the culture and the challenges it presents to the missionaries. These DVDs always point the viewers to the spiritual, emotional, physical needs on the field.
The photography ALWAYS is beautiful and tells a story all it's own.  They cannot produce these fast enough!",1464652800,2,384,5.366666666666666
