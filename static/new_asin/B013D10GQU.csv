7363220,5,B013D10GQU,"I first found out about this show from the Robotech Art 1 book from 1986. Because of this book I began searching for this on video back then to no avail. Eventually I was in luck (kinda) in the early 90s because Us Renditions released 8 volumes on Vhs (see pic below)  Only the first 17 episodes were dubbed and any fans were left hanging by a thread wondering what happened?

Years later another company put out a limited dvd set but it was pretty shoddy and nobody really supported it so it went out of print quickly. This new set put out by Eastern Star is THE edition to have! Not only does it have the original dub from the Us Renditions from the 90s it also has the original japanese with subs for the complete show!

I have been buying many anime releases by Eastern Star for quite some time now and the shows they put on dvd look REALLY good! This one is no exception! The picture quality is near blu ray looking! The picture is full of color, sound is good and I have only noticed a few times where an object on screen has a small interlacing issue where the lines of the object blur slightly. It's not too distracting because it's usually a hand or a piece of wall etc in the frame. It happens briefly and I don't know if this is from the transfer that Eastern Star did for this release or  the original master.

Many newer anime fans may be put off by the cover and art style of this classic show but it really is great if you LOVE Robotech (Macross) because the same company that made the original Macross made this along with Super Dimensional Cavalry Southern Cross (Which was turned into the Robotech Masters in the USA).

Eastern Star has done a Magnificent job at transferring this classic show on dvd.

Highly recommended for classic anime fans of Robotech/Macross!",1444867200,19,1783,4.3685800604229605

Audio:
Pretty decent Dolby 2.0 on both the English and Japanese tracks with no distortions on playback. US Renditions had, during the VHS era, completed English dubs on 17 episodes before abandoning the project due to low sales. The acting was decent particularly in a time when there was little emphasis on quality dub work. However, the scripts were well a little on the hammy side, and I still cant say differentiated idioblast with a straight face even after hearing it back in the early 90s.

Video:
The picture is very crisp and clean. The colors are vibrant and nice. I don't have access to previous releases or formats currently so I have nothing to compare to on that regard, but whats here is pretty good, especially if you're into 80s era TV. Both Discotek Media and prior licensor ImaginAsian are credited with work so Im not entirely certain who is responsible for the actual picture quality. There are optional subtitles as well; green ones to translate the opening and closing themes, yellow for the actual show.

In Summary:
Orguss is worth watching to understand 80s real robot genre was like. In a decade when the anime medium was full of such science fiction, this was a decent one to enjoy. As people are currently fascinated by time travel concept in movies and shows, this would likely be a good one to take a chance on, whether people are into anime or not.",1450742400,4,1559,5.011583011583012
