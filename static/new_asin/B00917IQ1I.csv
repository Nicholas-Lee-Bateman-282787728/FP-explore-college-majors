8533822,4,B00917IQ1I,"Fritz Lang, the legendary filmmaker who will be known for epics such as ""Metropolis"" and ""Die Nibelungen"", films such as ""M"" and ""Fury"" and most notably, the ""Dr. Mabuse"" films.

But for every filmmaker, before they accomplish success, their is that beginning where they have directed films that have not received much attention and are literally forgotten.

In November 2012, Kino Lorber released the 3-DVD set ""Fritz Lang: The Early Works"" which feature his 1919 silent film ""Harakiri"", the 1920 silent film ""Das Wandernde Bild"" (The Wandering Shadow) and his 1921 silent film ""Vier um die Frau"" (For Around the Woman).

What makes this set quite appealing for cineaste is that many of Lang's earlier films did not survive and the only way people know of these earlier films was through reviews on publications such as ""The Kinematograph"", ""Der Film"" or ""Lichtbildbuhne"".  And while his first two films ""Halbblut"" and ""Der Herr Der Liebe"" may not be accessible, fortunately films such as ""Die Spinnen"" (The Spiders) and ""Harakiri"", ""Das Wandernde Bild"" and ""Vier um Die Frau"" have been released in the U.S. on DVD courtesy of Kino Lorber.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

It's important for people to remember that each of the three films presented in ""Fritz Lang: Early Works"" were considered lost for many decades.  So, with that being said, the fact that a print of these once lost films of Fritz Lang has been found, is a miracle.  It's also important for people to know that a lot of silent films at the time were not taken care of.  They were seen as disposable entertainment not mean to be rewatched as the era never realized that people would have an interest in these classic films.

I must first add the preface that these films are watchable.  The do not have excessive nitrate damage but they do have specks and scratches and have been restored to the best quality possible.  But also, there are footage and frames missing and the restoration crew did the best they can to help viewers understand the film through intertitles.

All three films are presented in 1:33:1 and are color tinted.

First, let's begin with ""Harakiri"".  The restoration for the film was done by Nederlands Filmmuseum and Cineteca del Comune di Bologna. While there are some damage, white specks and scratches, the film is watchable.  The beauty of the film, especially the authentic Japanese costumes and decorations supplied by the Ethnographical Museum run by I.F.G. Umlauff is noticeable.  Compared to other silent films of its time, the quality considering its scratches and specks is still very good.  But of the three film presented, this is the weakest of the three.

The film features music by Aljoscha Zimmerman and performed by Sabrina Hausmann (violin), Mark Pogolski (piano) and Markus Steiner (percussion).

For the second film ""Das wandernde Bild"" (The Wandering Shadow), the restoration was done in 1987 courtesy of Stiftung Deutsche Kinemathek Berlin and Cinemateca Brasileira Sao Paulo.  According to Kino Lorber, at its premiere at Tauentzien Palace in Berlin, ""Das wandernde Bild"" had a a length of 2,032 meters.  The surviving edition, edited for release in Brazil, is 1,410 meters in length.  No script or intertitle list is known to exist.  For this edition, explanatory text has been added to facilitate comprehension of the plot where significant footage is missing.""

The picture quality for this film is actually quite good.  less scratches and white specks compared to ""Harakiri"" but you do see vertical lines, but nothing that would prevent you from enjoying the film.  The film features music by Aljoscha Zimmerman and performed by Sabrina Hausmann (violin) and Aljoscha Zimmerman (piano).

For the third film ""Vier um die Frau"" or ""Kampfende Herzende"" (For Around the Woman), according to Kino Lorber, the film was approved by the Berlin censor board in 1921 with a length of 1,707 meters.  The only known surviving original nitrate print comes from the collection of the Cinemateca Brasileira in Sao Paulo and has a length of 1,556 meters.  It is a Brazilian export copy entitled ""Coracoes em lucta"" (Hearts in Struggle).  It is tined and contains Portuguese titles, intertitles and inserts.  The print is heavily worn.  There are jumps in many scenes.  A censor card with the text of the original German titles is not available.

The source for this video master is the 1987 dupe negative of a reconstruction from the Deutsche Kinemathek - Museum for Film and Television, Berlin, and the Cinematheca Brasileira, Sao Paolo.  It is derived from a Brazilian distribution print and contains a reverse-translation of the Portuguese titles.  The most serious film damage was digitally retouched while still maintaining the integrity of the original footage.  The color correction is based on the original tinting of the nitrate copy.  This allowed compensation for variations within a single color.

While the film does have scratches and specks and vertical lines.  The film is still watchable.  There are some frame jumps but compared to ""Harakiri"", you can see much more detail in the footage.  The film features music by Aljoscha Zimmerman and performed by Sabrina Hausmann (violin), Aljoscha Zimmerman (piano) and Markus Steiner (percussion).

EXTRAS:

""Fritz Lang: The Early Works"" comes with a cardboard case.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I was quite thrilled when I first learned that Kino Lorber would be releasing Fritz Lang's earlier work for a DVD set titled ""Fritz Lang: The Early Works"".

Having followed Fritz Lang's cinema oeuvre and also reading books about his film, especially the fantastic Lotte Eisner 1976 book ""Fritz Lang"", Eisner would write about Lang's earlier work through German film reviews because these films were considered lost.  And the only earlier work that was accessible decades later was his films ""Die Spinnen"" (The Spiders) films in order to get an impression of a younger Lang as a filmmaker.

And here we are in 2012, over 90-years since these films were made and these films would receive reviews that would highlight Lang's choice of shooting outdoors, attention to plot but also earlier work that would showcase the early husband and wife team of director Fritz Lang and writer Thea von Harbou.

For ""Harakiri"", for today's audiences, some may be unnerved to see Caucasian portrayals of Japanese.  What is amazing is how elaborate the costume and set design was courtesy of the Ethnographical Museum run by I.F. G. Umlauff in order to capture the look of Japan.  From the kimonos, the interiors to the outdoor set design, I was quite impressed of how much was put into making the film look authentic Japanese, despite using German talent and shooting the film in Germany.

Inspired by ""Madame Butterfly"", while plot was important for a young Fritz Lang, especially in capturing emotion, the film itself suffers from certain explanations of ""why?"".  Why does the sailor get married to O-Take and then marries a European and why return back to Japan, to the same village of where his Japanese wife is waiting.  Of course, the focus of the film is about Japanese honor and how far one would commit harakiri to protect that honor.  And because there were not many films about Japanese culture tailored for a non-Japanese audience, the film fascinated viewers because there was nothing like it at the time.

A reviewer in 1919 for ""The Berliner Borsenzeitung"" wrote of ""Harakiri"" as ""The outdoor shots are quite splendid and very picturesque, particularly those of Japanese festivities. One would not have thought the happy grounds of Woltersdorf could produce all this...a film product of the highest rank"".

As for the second film ""Das Wandernde Bild"" (The Wandering Shadow).  For modern viewers, watching this today may seemed quite farfetched.  Similar to a '70s or '80s horror movie in which a victim would be running but yet the antagonist who is walking at a snail's pace somehow manages to capture its victim.  For the first half of ""The Wandering Shadow"", the film features a chase scene in which a widowed woman is trying to escape the antagonist (her brother-in-law) and travels and climbs mountains and cliffs but yet, the man who should be very far behind, is somehow able to catch up with her.

We are then shown her widowed husband who actually faked his death to live as a hermit in those mountains and is unable to leave until he sees a statue of the virgin walking.  While the film does make one roll their eyes because of how farfetched it was, you can't help but be drawn in by the landscape of where the film was shot.  From a shot of hundreds in a village near a dock to the icy mountains, there was a wonderful focus of capturing the sense of adventure of its female protagonist Irmgard Vanderheit and trying to create a vile antagonist John Vanderheit.

But because the film gone beyond the typical studio shot and would feature a character in a variety of stunning locations for its time, and because of the film's ability to capture life outside of the characters through the villages, the film received positive reviews.

A reviewer wrote in 1921 for ""Film-Kurier"" of ""Das wandernde Bild"", ""Fritz Lang's direction is outstanding, particularly the crowd scenes, e.g. the peasant wedding on the Bavarian mountain lake, the peasant dance, the changing group scenes with ever-new types, all very colourful and vivid.  The careful distribution of effects ensures that everyone of the five acts is equally lively.""

Unfortunately, the caveat of watching this film is the true ending is forever lost.  So, the film ends with a summary based off a booklet.

And for the final film ""Vier un die Frau"" (Four Around a Woman), the film was interesting in the fact that it was an earlier style that Lang would focus on tragedy but also the use of many, many characters.

To tell you the truth, what I found fascinating but also yet frustrating about this film is how it doesn't showcase the protagonist earlier in the film.  The film starts off with all these shady characters and all of a sudden, these characters are hardly shown when the film's focus turns to Florence and her husband Harry. So, pacing was a bit off for this film but its strength lies on its theme of a jealous husband trying to trap his wife and uncover a lie of a possible affair.

Uncensored, the film would feature Florence's friend discussing how her husband is always working but it doesn't mean she can't have fun with other men.  And she tries to cajole Florence into having some fun, but Florence is a wife who is dedicated to her husband to the very end.

But an interesting film that shows more of the complexity of Lang/von Harbou's structure, may it be towards the writing or directing of the film.  And in 1921, a reviewer for ""Film und Presse"" was quite pleased with the film, the reviewer wrote, ""with an original plot, logical and consistent in spite of a host of disparate themes; dramatically well constructed, interesting right up to its tragic ending that could be called a real film ending"".

For fans of Fritz Lang's work, It's so fantastic to have these films, that were considered lost, now available and restored on DVD.  One can't expect the earlier works of a filmmaker to be his best and for Fritz Lang, he is one filmmaker who has done so many different types of films, that there is no doubt that his films from the 1920s and 1940s are among his best.

But for any cineaste, it's that glimpse of how a filmmaker got his start before becoming a well-known filmmaker. For today's viewer, these films will not compare to films like ""M"", ""Spies"", ""Metropolis"", ""The Testament of Dr. Mabuse"", etc. but when you put yourself in the shoes of viewers during that era in time, you start to realize why people had a fascination with Fritz Lang's work.  ""Harakiri"" was a film about Japanese, but yet not made in Japan, nor did it star Japanese talent but yet was made to look as authentic to Japan as possible.  ""Das wandernde Bild"" for its cinematography and its outdoor chase scene to the portrayal of sinful characters of ""Vier um die Frau"".

They show the earlier style of Lang and these three films did receive positive reviews and help introduce audiences to Lang and his wife Thea von Harbou and not long after, Lang would come back with even better films with ""Destiny"", ""Dr. Mabuse: The Gambler"", the two films of ""Die Nibulengen"" and ""Metropolis"".

Overall, if you are a fan of Fritz Lang's oeuvre, chances are you may have not seen his earlier films and if that is the case, ""Fritz Lang: The Early Works"" is highly recommended!",1354233600,22,12661,4.884885353299017
8533823,4,B00917IQ1I,"When I saw this set announced, I was surprised and delighted as I was completely unfamiliar with any of these movies. I must have read about them in Patrick McGilligan's thorough 1997 biography of Lang but I don't recall them. Then again they haven't been available for home viewing until now. All three are based on earlier restorations from the 1970s and 80s but are only just now coming to Blu-Ray and DVD. While they were fascinating to see, they're definitely a mixed bag and are unlikely to be of any real interest to anyone outside of silent film enthusiasts and/or Fritz Lang completists.

Film #1: HARAKIRI (1919)- This was by far the weakest of the three despite being based on MADAME BUTTERFLY and featuring Lil Dagover. With a few exceptions, the film lacks the dynamic Lang visual flourishes and the story, as presented, is just not that involving. It does have great sets and costumes and HARAKIRI was released with a killer poster which is reproduced on the DVD cover. The best silent version of MADAME BUTTERFLY is the 1922 early Technicolor film TOLL OF THE SEA with a teenage Anna May Wong.

Film #2: THE WANDERING SHADOW (1920) - Although not the best of the trio, THE WANDERING SHADOW was my personal favorite and was the first collaboration between Lang and future wife Thea von Harbou. The story involves a proponet of free love, a woman on the run, and Christian mythology involving the Virgin Mary. The strong but tormented female lead was Mia May who specialized in these types of roles and the Alpine location shooting looks forward to the mountain films of Arnold Fanck. While the film is melodramatic and improbable, it is highly entertaining.

Film #3: FOUR AROUND THE WOMAN (1921) - This film foreshadows the Fritz Lang that most people are familiar with. The story of a wealthy businesman's wife with its criminal underworld setting looks forward to the DR MABUSE films and to M. Seedy dives (Upton's Tavern is a classic) are contrasted with an opulent hotel (similar to THE LAST LAUGH) and characters who look like something out of THE THREEPENNY OPERA (perhaps Bertolt Brecht's inspiration?). It is this film that will appeal more to the general public at large.

The restoration work on the films varies from title to title. HARAKIRI, which was located in the Netherlands, is plagued by several missing frames and a very contrasty look athough even a quality restoration wouldn't help the glacial pace and uninteresting characters. Considerable footage is missing from WANDERING SHADOW but the reconstruction with intertitles works just fine and the pictorial quality of the print is much better. FOUR AROUND THE WOMAN is also missing footage but it flows rather well although the complex plot seems to be missing something. This print was located in Brazil.

The F. W. Murnau Foundation has done their usual fine job considering the material they had to work with although, as I mentioned earlier, the appeal of this set will be rather limited. The musical settings by Aljoscha Zimmerman are well suited to the material although a little more exoticism in HARAKIRI might have helped to make it less tedious. Thanks to Kino Classics for making the set of rare films available although without Fritz Lang's name, they probably wouldn't have resurfaced at all.",1352592000,26,3292,4.903052064631957
