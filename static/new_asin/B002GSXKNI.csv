3925542,4,B002GSXKNI,I like the first two movies. Ryan Reynolds made the third and the last one I refuse to even watch. All around a decent deal considering the the movies are about ten bucks separately. I say get it if you are looking for a deal.,1275523200,3,226,4.044444444444444
3925543,3,B002GSXKNI,"I found the first three films to be brilliant.  The action and delivery were exactly what I would have expected.  However, the fourth film was total crap.  Not only was Wesley Snipes not in the lead, making  continuity of the character unbelievable, but the guy who took his place couldn't act to save his life.

Even the storyline was implausible. I turned it off after only 30 minutes and went and read a book.

If they're going to continue with sequals of a characterline like this they need to keep the main character's identity true.  Another words the same actor.  Otherwise can it.",1274659200,27,588,4.640776699029126
3925544,3,B002GSXKNI,Don't waste your time with Blade 4.  The first three are great but the fourth is a disaster.,1272240000,,92,4.111111111111111
3925545,5,B002GSXKNI,I LOVED ALL OF THE BLADE'S BUT THE LAST ONE ON THERE WAS LIKE A TV SERIES MOVIE. I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE MOVIE. NO WONDER IT DIDN'T STAY ON TV FOR LONG. THE GUY DID NOT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE BLADE AND THE STORY LINE WAS STUPID. BUT I ENJOYED THE FIRST 3 MOVIES IN THE BLADE COLLECTION.,1271289600,,283,3.896551724137931
3925546,5,B002GSXKNI,"This is definitely a great collectors item for anyone who loves the tale of  vampires. The ""Day Walker"" twist makes this collection an awesome action-packed series to watch over and over again!",1269993600,,193,5.03125
3925547,5,B002GSXKNI,"Un buen trabajo de New Line Home Video en juntar 4 peliculas en dos DVDs. Buena calidad en Sonido e imagen.las dos primeras son excelentes. La tercera pelicula es buena, pero la cuarta es mediocre. De todas formas, muchas gracias y continuen realizando dichas compilaciones",1266537600,,273,5.088888888888889
3925548,3,B002GSXKNI,"This is a reivew of the set and not the movies.  Surprisingly, the quality of these DVDs is pretty good.  There is some pixelation on my 52 inch flat screen, but much less than I expectetd.  Very watchable, although for die hard fans of the series, I would probably recommend going with the single disc or blu ray version.  The reason for my 3 stars, is not the quality of the transfer, but the packaging...definitely lacking here. Unfortunately, the sleeve/flap for the first disc rests awkwardly, directly on top of the 2nd dvd, creating a number of obvious scratches.  I returned my copy for a new one (at target, not amazon) and received the same thing, with the scratches in almost the exact same distribution.  Skipping has been minimal, but is probably variable and may depend on your player.  For those of you who will be dissatisfied with scratched discs, I can imagine that the great majority of these sets will have at least a few scratches.  For those who don't mind a few scratches and a little pixelation, this will probably be a nice buy.",1265846400,73,1053,4.623655913978495
3925570,5,B002GSXKNI,This is a pretty good set for a pretty good price. I wouldn't exactly say that this trilogy (I haven't watched the fourth video and don't plan to) is great but if you are in the mood for swords guns and vampires this is the trilogy for you!,1522540800,,240,4.020833333333333
3925571,4,B002GSXKNI,Very good movie series ..Wesley snipes was born to play that role and its always a joy to see Kris Kristofferson !!,1522022400,,115,4.2727272727272725

3925574,4,B002GSXKNI,"If you are into the Blade series, this will  do you just fine.  Entertaining and  holds your attention. Always liked Wesley. Just don't get too close when he's armed!!",1516320000,,167,4.689655172413793
3925575,4,B002GSXKNI,"Good movies, good price. 4 star rating was for the packaging. You'll want to add these to your Marvel collection.",1515628800,,113,4.7
3925576,4,B002GSXKNI,"I appreciate that all four movies were put together but as a fellow Wesley Snipes fan, the last movie Blade: House of Chton was THE WORSE MOVIE EVER and I am soo glad Wesley did not perform in that horrible movie. The movie was not even complete and leaves the viewer in pure disappointment. I swear I literally just wanted to break the movie in half because it is not even WORTH viewing let alone rating. If anyone sees that movie first before the Wesley Snipe ones it will literally ruin the whole experience. Loved the other movies as usually but House of Chton was definitely not worth the buy. Would of spent more money just to get the first 3 movies individually.",1515369600,,669,4.4471544715447155

3925642,5,B002GSXKNI,"I've been a fan of blade since it premiered.

For those who may not know the series, please be adviced that the first movie is the best by far, and things went downhill from there. Also, bear in mind that ""House of Chthon"" is ""sort of"" a reboot and the first two episodes of a short lived TV series on Spike TV. If you compare to a movie, is bad. But as TV series go, is quite good.

Then again, for the price, is A-OK",1493251200,,418,3.9058823529411764

They aren't anything magnificent, but they are good. When I purchased this it was cheaper to buy the 4 together than to get just the 3 in a pack.",1474588800,,297,3.806451612903226
