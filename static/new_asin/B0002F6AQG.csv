8027531,4,B0002F6AQG,You basically get what you pay for with this disc. It's short and nothing on here is too amazing. To me the highlights were fred pattachia with some very good surfing and strider at teahupoo. The tow in session at jaws is part of the bonus features and is quite short. There is much better footage of jaws tow ins on riding giants and step into liquid. The video runs about 35 minutes not including the bonus features...it's quite short but it's definitely worth the amazon price.,1135468800,8,480,4.528735632183908
