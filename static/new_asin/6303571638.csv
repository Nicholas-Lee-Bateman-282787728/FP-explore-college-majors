Love, Hate, War, Choice, Significance of Life...these topics are timeless and portrayed intricately in this film, reminding how deeply connected we all are, even at the ""far corners"" of the earth, with the outcome of our futures hinging on many single choices. Perception of how these choices are tied together and impact each other is challenged through playing with the concept that time is not linear. This film dares to ask if we can break the cycle of war and hate. ""War is a Virus"" and ""Time doesn't wait. And the circle is not round.""",1251244800,4,674,4.6722689075630255

It is about the Balkan wars of the 1990's that were so decried by Western Europeans, yet they did so little to prevent them.  The film in fact shows how the sensation hungry Western media often feed the killing frenzy.

687562,4,6303571638,"Macedonian film with English subtitles consists of three stories focusing on tragic love affairs.

The first story set in the beautiful Macedonian mountains is about a young monk who takes on a vow of silence and defends/hides a young Albanian woman who is accused of murder.  He is forced to leave the monastery and their relationship comes to a brutal end.

The second story is set in London.  A beautiful woman is torn between the love for her husband and leaving him for a famous war photographer and Macedonian by the name of Aleksandar.  Her relationship with her husband comes to a violent end.

The final story pulls the prior two stories together.  Aleksandar, the war photographer, is sickened about his role in the death of a civilian in his effort to get the ""big news picture.""  He leaves his job in London as a war photographer and returns home to Macedonia.  He learns that his home village is torn apart between civil strife between the Macedonians and the Albanians.  Hana, his Albanian girlfriend, is banned from seeing him again.  Aleksandar, the former photographer who from a distance captured civil war in pictures - now tries to do his part in ending the senseless violence and hatred - instead he finds that he ultimately becomes a casualty (and is in the picture instead of taking the picture).

Recap:

1) Film is divided into 3 stories (with the third pulling the first two together) and they are told backwards which is confusing.

2) Despite the confusion, the images (facial, countryside, city, mountains, skyline), the emotions, the characters, the relationships (civil war where neighbors and friends turn on each other) are all deeply moving.  This film will stay with me for some time.

3) Excellent music/soundtrack by the Anastasia band.",1216857600,2,1773,4.899328859060403
687563,5,6303571638,"I had heard only that ""Before the Rain"" is a great movie about issues in the present day Balkans.  It is an area of interest to me because of it's history and it's on-going internal strife.  I have read a number of books that have given me a sense of what the culture is about.  I have come away from studying it's history with an appreciation (rightly or wrongly) that only a man as powerful as Marshal Tito could reign over such internal animosities.  However, until I watched ""Before the Rain"", I didn't fully comprehend the level of such hatred.

The brilliance of ""Before the Rain"" is seen in the first Act of the movie (Which has conveniently identified the three Acts in case we somehow miss the signifigance).  I dare not give away too much in describing the sequence of events.  However, consider that you were moved to give up that which you held most precious in your life to help someone else.  Then, after making the sacrifice, you discover how little the rest of the world cares for what you did; especially those whom you expected support from.  The message is much deeper than that mainly because of the skills of the writer/director Milcho Manchevski who brings to the screen the passions that lead to such self-destructive actions.

The second Act, for me, was a reminder that the hatreds and vendettas are so internalized that their victims could be relocated to anywhere in the world and still need to act out their passions.  It was also a helpful way to introduce the man whobecame the main character in the movie.

The third Act was a reinforcement of the first with the added message that no one can change these passions that have already been unleashed on their victims.  The efforts our our hero are futile against a feud that has lasted 600 years.

Amidst the rustic beauty of Macedonia and the outstanding preformances by the cast, Manchevski has told his country, his region, and his world the story they all need to hear.  His pesamistic message sobers us but also gives hope in a way.  If people can begin to see themselves in this movie, maybe that can see the problem as well.  While the rest of us look from afar at the problems of a different culture, maybe we, too, might come to understand the self-destructive nature of our own vendettas.",1215129600,3,2277,4.596534653465347
687564,5,6303571638,"I had to watch this film for a foreign film class .. it was by far the best film I've seen.  It's an amazing story, with a circular plot.  I highly recommend it.",1211414400,2,161,3.8484848484848486
687565,5,6303571638,"Finally, BEFORE THE RAIN is on DVD. Best of all, the folks at Criterion picked up this marvelous film and have restored it to pristine quality. The digital transfer was  supervised and approved by director Milcho Manchevski. It is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.78:1. The sound is in Dolby Digital Stereo 2.0. There's an accompanying audio commentary and an interview with Rade Serbedzija who played Aleksander (more about him later) in the film. Also included is an essay by film scholar Ian Christie and the original trailer and few other goodies.

What's BEFORE THE RAIN about? A simple synopsis of the film will not suffice. Essentially it is a poetic, albeit tragic look at war and love in the Balkans of the 1990s made by Macedonian director, Milcho Manchevski.

Here's why it's a brilliant film. The photography and music from the Macedonian group ""Anastasia"" --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-The-Rain-Pred-Dozhdot-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B0000042IB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before The Rain (Pred Dozhdot): Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>&nbsp;-- is breathtaking and lingers with you days after watching/listening to it. The tripartite narrative structure challenges the linearity of history by linking unsuspecting people, events and objects in a cause-and-effect context. Lastly, it explores how religious, gender and ethnic differences in Macedonia shape both love and politics, even in a global context.

Like all film-makers, Manchevski tells his story with Words, Faces and Pictures. In BEFORE THE RAIN these three components become three parts of the film, in which characters and events are intertwined. In Words, a young Macedonian monk named Kiril (Grgoire Colin) from a 12th-century monastery, has taken a vow of silence. He discovers an Albanian girl named Zamira (Labina Mitevska) hiding in his room. He protects her and dire consequences result. Ironically, he speaks no `words' and when he breaks his vow of silence, neither one understands the other's language. In Faces, a London photo editor, Anne (Katrin Cartlidge), is torn between two men: her estranged husband (Jay Villiers), for whom she feels little love, and Aleksander (Rade Serbedzija), a Pulitzer prize-winning war photographer. Her personal crisis is overshadowed when a tragedy unexpectedly occurs in a London restaurant. Both photographers initially detach themselves emotionally from their subjects (the faces) they photograph, but eventually each is confronted in a personal way and must `face' the consequences of their actions. In Pictures, Aleksander leaves London to return to his childhood village in Macedonia. But things have changed considerably in his 16-year absence. The violence and carnage he witnessed as a frontline photographer (notably the death of a Bosnian POW he may have accidently caused) is inescapable; ethno-religious differences have turned neighbours into enemies. When Hanna, his childhood love from a neighbouring village, seeks his help to protect her (their implied) daughter (Zamira), Aleksander is thrust into an ethnic conflict which has tragic consequences. Unbeknownst to the viewer in Words, we eventually learn Aleksander is also Kiril's uncle whom Kiril discusses in a previous scene with Zamira. The big `picture', if you will, segues all of these people and events into one.

In structuring the film this way, Manchevski demonstrates the interconnectivity of globalism, both its innocuous and menacing aspects. In Words, a mentally unstable Macedonian machine-guns a cat while listening to the music of the Beastie Boys on his Walkman. In Faces, a woman passing through a cemetery in London, where Anne and Aleksander are discussing their future plans, listens to the same song on her Walkman. In another scene, the ethnic violence observed in Macedonia crosses international borders and spills over into a London restaurant when a Balkan nationalist attacks a waiter. After being ejected, he returns armed with a gun and randomly kills several diners, including Anne's estranged husband.

Manchevski also shows how women, regardless of ethnicity, religion or nationality, are subordinated. This is especially the case with Zamira. Although she appears very briefly in Words and Pictures, she is the catalyst that sets in motion the cycle of violence at the centre of BEFORE THE RAIN. She is an Albanian Muslim, who unlike her mother Hanna, rebels against the expectations imposed on Muslim women, defies her grandfather and enrages her brother by challenging the norm. The events that lead to her death in Words, unfold in Pictures. Zamira is accused of luring and of killing Stojan (a Macedonian). In Words, her grandfather alludes to it. Whether the encounter was voluntary or involuntary is not revealed but Stojan's womanising would suggest that Zamira could have been raped. The violence Zamira encounters, and the subordination required of Hanna parallels the humiliation suffered by Christian Macedonian women. Neither religious tradition provides women parity with men, particularly with regard to sexuality. In Pictures, Stojan's wife is forced to serve dinner to him and his family as he makes sexual overtures to the school teacher. In Faces, Anne's estranged husband implies she should resign her position, have the baby and become a simple housewife. Ironically, Aleksander asks Anne to go with him to Macedonia and raise a family.

Insofar as religion is concerned, Manchevski portrays it as one of the causes for ethnic violence rather than the solution. The love ethic which is at the heart of both  Christian and  Muslim tradition is superceded by the invidious ethic of an eye for an eye. Mitre, the leader of the Macedonian militia, makes this clear to the abbot in Words, when he is tracking down Zamira. He asserts that 500 years of history justify his right to avenge the death of one of their own. In Faces, Manchevski graphically illustrates the notion of an eye for an eye when Anne's husband is shot in the eye by the Balkan nationalist. In Pictures, Aleksander's own people shoot him while trying to save Zamira, even after pleading to have the accusations against her taken to a legal court. The story comes full circle.

This is hammered out in one of the single most powerful images -- and there many -- at the beginning in Words, village children have made a circle out of twigs and placed two docile turtles in it. They've created gun turrets on the shell of the turtles, placed them in mock battle and are shouting, ""Go Ninja turtle, kill him."" The scene cuts to the monks in some ritual involving prayers and incense. The camera cuts back to a single turtle in the circle, where bullets have been sprinkled and the twigs set afire; the bullets explode killing the turtle while the monks pray, oblivious to the event. In less than ten minutes, Manchevski introduces us to the central themes of the film: violence, religion and taking sides.

Aleksander is the protagonist of this film. It's interesting to note he shares the namesake of another Macedonian - Alexander the Great. Not surprisingly too, he is similar to Alexander the Great. Both have experienced war, travelled much of the world, loved foreign women, mingled and adopted foreign customs, bridged cultural barriers, etc. Even in gallantry, they share a common heroic stature as defenders of the underdog, the vanquished.  But alas, true to the more famous Alexander, the metaphorical one dies also at an early age.

Why Manchevski created such a character is pure conjecture, but I suspect it has something to do with the Eastern Orthodox concept of Alexander the Great as a pre-Christ figure -- a champion, a saviour, a martyr; in which case, Manchevski's Aleksander is certainly all of these. But his passionate and platonic love of humanity does not save any one, least of all himself;  it only serves as a lesson.

This leads me to conclude that to break the circle of violence, ethno-religious hatred, wars in general, it seems as though Manchevski wants to say love is the way, but the reality is humanity is not ready to realise this incontrovertible truth.

Great film! Five stars in my estimate!",1206835200,25,8222,5.303379416282642

687567,5,6303571638,"I first watched this relatively unknown masterpiece when I translated its subtitles into Turkish in 1995 for the Ankara Film Festival.

I remember that I started working on the translation with two fellow translators. We had the English subtitles which were provided to us in text format, but the film copy that the Macedonian Ministry of Culture had given us had to subtitles on it. Almost two thirds of the dialogue was in Albanian and Macedonian languages. So we had to patiently match the Albanian and Macedonian dialogue in a subtitle box which required us to see every frame 5 or 6 times.

I still remember that all three of us were so captivated with the story and the fascinating cinematography that after just 5 minutes into the film we just stopped matching the subtitles and started simply enjoying the movie until we realized we are not translating the movie but just watching it. It was like love at first sight for all three of us!

This film is simply unforgettable and the soundtrack will still haunt you long after the movie ends. I wasn't able to believe that this is Manchevski's debut film as a director.",1181347200,3,1124,4.695431472081219

The tale focuses on a Macedonian man who has long since left Macedonia and its problems to become a photographer. He lives in London and is having an affair with a woman (played by Katrin Cartlidge who also played in British film Career Girls and Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves) who announces she is pregnant. She has no clue about the things he has seen and done in the war he has just photographed in Bosnia. He returns to Macedonia to visit family and experiences again the violence and hatred between the people.

How there is no real victim or an opressor. How it is  hard or even impossible to pinpoint the guilty ones. It is a kind of dark  comment that there is not a safe haven where people are exempt from fight,  cruelty, violence, and senseless killings. But the story also doesnt forget  to show that as much as hate is a nondisposible trait of society, where  nationalist pride, prejudice, stereotyping and many other ignorant and  dangerous attitudes are side products, it is just one side of the coin.

7851187,5,6303571638,"Ive watched this film (in the wonderful recent edition from Criterion) three times over the past few weeks, and I cannot get it out of my head. Im astonished that this is the first feature from director Milcho Manchevski  this is world-class cinema, crafted with artistry, depth and subtlety, taking on a subject as horrifying as the ethnic / sectarian violence that seems to be staining our world with terrifying, increasing frequency, filling it with imperfect, completely believable human characters, and setting it against a natural backdrop of some of the most heart-wrenchingly beautiful locations, stunningly photographed, that a viewer is likely to encounter anywhere. The contrasts  images, events, emotions, values, choices and actions  are stark and sometimes jarringjust like those in the real world. Manchevski has created his story with care and commitment  and he has continued that commitment throughout the twists and turns of an arduous production path that at times left him wondering if the film would ever be finished, emerging with a finished product that any director would be satisfied to call a career-defining work. There is much complexity here  but it never gets in the way of a story that, while placed firmly in its setting, is so universal in its message that it cannot help but resonate within the heart and mind of any viewer anywhere in the world.

Before the rain is subtitled a story in three parts  each has its own central protagonists, some of whom overlap, and well-defined environment. As the film progresses and moves from one section to the next, it becomes apparent that the timeline of this work is more than simply non-linear, or circular. Manchevski has taken inspiration  whether conscious or subconscious  from no less an artist than the unique M. C. Escher, constructing something the director calls a circle with a kink in it, or perhaps a Mbius strip of time. As contrived as this premise might sound at first, rather than distracting viewers from the soul and story of this film, it winds up enhancing it  at the end, when the credits roll, it is almost impossible not to ponder what one has seen, to replay it in the mind, to discuss it with others. And with a theme as vital as the seemingly endless cycle of violence that we human beings seem intent on inflicting on ourselves as a race, perhaps concentration, decompression and dissection of what has been seen, heard and felt over the length of this experience would do us more than a little good. It certainly won't end or go away if we ignore it.

The film begins with a quote from Serbian / Bosnian poet Mehmedalija Mea Selimovi (1910-1982) : With a shriek, birds flee across the black sky, people are silent, my blood aches from waiting. Manchevskis title itself, this quote from the epigraph of one of Selimovis poems, repeated mentions of a rain that is expected, and other references that are imbibed with a sense of heightened anticipation, fill the film and the viewer with a tension that slowly builds to its climax. Several times the image of startled birds presages an event, or the arrival of a person, or lends a sense of foreboding to various scenes.

Part one (entitled Words) takes place in Macedonia  a monastery and the surrounding grounds, to be exact, which, from appearances, could be situated in any time during the past several centuries. It is only when we see a jets vapor trail in the sky that the scene comes firmly to rest in the present  but as this image is contrasted with the ancient painted icons and the darkened, serene architecture and lighting of the chapel and the monks quarters, there remains an undercurrent feeling of timelessness that pulls like a riptide, which lies on the landscape like a morning mist. A young monk  Father Kiril (Grgoire Colin)  is picking tomatoes in a garden, his face and posture radiating a sense of peace, sure in the knowledge that he is exactly where he belongs. An older priest approaches and begins speaking to him, making small talk about the weather. 'The flies are biting,' he says. 'It's going to rain.' As Kiril stands to walk with him, the elder man gestures across the plain below them and adds, 'It's already raining over there.' As they walk along the mountain path that leads from the monastery itself to the nearby chapel, the rolling sound of distant thunder is heard. The old man says, 'Thunder always gives me a jolt. I fear they've begun shooting here, too.' They walk past a group of children playing at war, using turtles as tanks, sitting in a circle, an apt visual metaphor for the just-referenced cycle of violence. Kiril's brother priest muses, 'Time never dies. The circle is not round'. This phrase recurs, in one form or another, in other parts of the film. A lightning strike in the distance is followed by its accompanying clap of thunder. The old man says, 'I nearly took a vow of silence like you. But this heavenly beauty merits words.' The natural panorama visible behind them is the perfect backdrop for his statement.

After the service, as Kiril is in his cell preparing for bed, he is shocked as he sits on his bunk to find it occupied. A young woman  her gender not apparent at first due to her short hair, slim build and the lighting  has taken refuge there. She speaks Albanian, Kiril speaks Macedonian  each of them is frightened at the circumstances in which they have found themselves. He understands enough from her manner that she is hiding from some sort of danger, and makes the decision to shelter her. Still unsure of his intentions, her trust begins to warm at his gift of fresh tomatoes (he has correctly guessed that she is hungry). A beautiful, effectively composed shot  one of many in this incredible film  captures her, out of focus, crouching in the dark across the moonlit room, with Kiril lying on his bunk, his back to her, his features clearly defined, smiling at the sound of her eating the tomatoes. In Albanian, she offers, My name is Zamira, and, after a pause, her judgment : You are good.

Kirils choice to hide the young woman in the face of the irreversable implications of his action on both of them is the central theme of the first part of the film. He has turned a corner on the path of his life from which there is no turning back. Armed men come to the monastery in search of the the girl  The whore killed our brother, they say. The elder priest attempts to calm them  the old and the new are contrasted again when the apparent leader of the armed men says, An eye for an eye  blood is in the air, to which the priest replies, Turn the other cheek. After attempting to dissuade them  and after receiving assurances, in private, from the other monks that there is no girl there  the head priest agrees to allow them search the premises. The men, while outwardly showing respect and reverence towards the priests, procede to ransack the place, leaving its traditional solitude shattered. Kirils tension increases as they prepare to search his cell. The director cranks this up subtly by not showing the activity directly, but by having the camera remain with Kiril on the floor below. The sounds of their search  the rough footsteps, furniture being dragged across the floor objects being thrown about and broken  filter down to the anxious monk. The camera looks up, and through the gaps between the floorboards motes of dust drift down into the light, dislodged by the men above. They return empty-handed  the girl has not been found, much to Kirils surprise and relief.

The searchers are not convinced, however, and refuse to leave the area of the monastery, posting a guard outside, waiting. Kiril returns to his cell to find it turned upside-down. In another old-new contrast, one of the intruders is seen outside the walls of the ancient structure, dancing to the sounds of the Beastie Boys blaring from his transistor radio. That evening, as Kiril lies on his cot, we can see the shadows of rain, running down the window opposite, play across his face. He starts from his sleep and sits up to see Zamira standing in the room. Rubbing his eyes, he looks again and realizes that he is dreaming  she is not there. A bit later, this time without the ghosts of rain on his face, he awakens again and sees her  this time the apparition is real, and she is indeed there. The next morning, two of the elder monks enter his cell unexpectedly and discover her  they feel they have no choice but to expel both the girl and Kiril from the monastery. Although Kiril and Zamira, the very picture of cast-out innocents being thrown into the world, manage to sneak past the sleeping guard, they soon encounter an equally dangerous foe  members of the girls family and villagers, including her grandfather and brother. Their animosity toward her is open  they consider her to be a troublemaker, her grandfather repeatedly calling her whore and slut. It is not a pretty confrontation, and the outcome is bleak from the start.

The second part of the film is entitled Faces, and the setting moves to bustling, modern London. A brief shot of a brick wall, acting as a thread connecting the two parts, shows scrawled graffiti that echoes the phrase spoken by the old monk in the first part of the film: 'Time never dies. The circle is not round.' One of the main characters at the centre of part two is Anne (Katrin Cartlidge), who is employed at a news photo agency  she is married, but is estranged from her husband and involved in an affair with Aleksandar Kirkov (Rade erbedija), a Macedonian-born photographer whose work in the theatre of the Balkan Wars has recently won him a Pulitzer Prize. He returns from his assignment in Bosnia unexpectedly and announces to Anne that he has resigned his position. Shocked by this revelation, she presses him for a reason  she understands both him and his passion for his work well enough, to know that something serious has happened to drive him to such a decision. She begs, What happened, Alex? What happened to you in Bosnia?, to which he quietly replies, I killed. He has always staunchly refused to take sides in any conflict from which he is reporting, considering himself to be a neutral window through which the world can peer. Without explaining any further, it is apparent that he feels he has crossed that line, which he has long vowed never to do. He is broken, he is burned out  he is determined to return to his home in Macedonia, which he last visited 16 years before, and to take Anne with him, to live out their lives together there.

Anne is unable to bring herself to go with him on such short notice  there are complications in her life, not the least of which is her husband, that she feels cannot be resolved satisfactorly enough to leave immediately. She begs him, be patient with me  he has made up his mind to go back, with or without her, and replies, Have a nice lifedont forget to write, and walks away.

The violence that people see on television news programs, and in newspaper and magazine photographs, can seem like another world  but sadly, more and more, that violence has a disturbing way of finding a crack in the wall and worming its way into everyday lives and activity. This is the infection that finds Anne and her husband Nick as they dine in a quiet, refined London restaurant. He thinks she has asked him there to attempt a reconciliation...but she reveals to him that she wants a divorce. As they work their way through this discussion, their private tension naturally mounts, and it is accentuated by frequent camera cuts between them, other diners, and an additional drama that develops when a man enters and begins talking with a waiter  both of them speaking in a foreign language, in tones too low to heard clearly (their dialogue is not subtitled, inferring that the viewer can learn all that is needed from the rhythm and pitch of their speech). The conversation between these two men becomes louder and more heated, growng into an abusive argument, with the man repeatedly tossing currency into the face of the waiter. The matre-d, attempting to restore order, intervenes and tells the waiter that he should leave and not come back  effectively firing him  and that he should take his friend with him. The angry words escalate further into an all-out brawl, and customers scatter. Subdued by a number of other employees, the man leaves, only to return a few minutes later with the intent of wreaking even more violent havoc, spraying the room with gunfire. The ensuing carnage plays out so quickly that its over almost before it begins  yet, as is the case with scenes such as this, at the same time it seems to last forever.

Part three (Pictures) sees a return to Macedonia  but instead of the tranquil setting of the ancient monastery, our first view is of a modern jet landing in Skopje. The subdued blue, moonlit hues that visually ruled much of part one are replaced by scenes brightly lit by sunlight, as if to imply that events are to be revealed more openly, unable to remain hidded, unavoidably seen by newly-opened eyes. Aleksandar has returned, and after a ride in an old bus along dusty rural roads to his old village, finds himself welcomed not by family and friends, but by a young thug brandishing an automatic weapon (one of the armed men who come to the monastery in part one), demanding to know where he is going. Alex turns to walk away and ignore him, but finds the youth in his path again, threatening to shoot him. The photographer sighs and says, Youll hurt yourself, and before the boy can react, snatches the gun away from him, much as one would take a toy from an unruly child. Anyone home? asks Alex, gently slapping the boy on the head. He slings the gun over his shoulder and continues into the village, leaving the young man hurling insults at him from behind. He makes his way down the narrow dirt lanes that are etched into his memory, pausing at one house and reaching up into a recess in the wall, retrieving a water pistol that he had apparently left their as a child. There is a sense of watching a classic American western as he walks along : villagers are reluctant to speak with him beyond a nod or a brief spoken greeting, or to meet his eye for more than a second. Startled birds take to the air, and we see a shot of a child's swing, in motion, apparently just vacated at the approach of a stranger. When he reaches his former house, he finds much of it roofless  the walls are standing, but the structure shows a weary, harshly-weathered visage that is the architectural equivalent of seeing the scars (both physical and emotional) of warfare on the faces of human beings who have endured such horror. Alex shakes his head, laughing silently at himself for ever imagining that he would find anything different after all this time, especially considering the events that have transpired in his absence.

After spending the night in his old bed, he re-connects with his cousin Zdrave and old friend Mitre (the latter turns out to be the uncle of the young man who had challenged Alex on his arrival). The sense that things have changed more than he imagined in Macedonia sinks in more and more as he spends time with his old acquintances  the ethnic and religious hatred that has cloaked other areas of the former Yugoslavia in blood and death has begun to spread its stain here as well. Christians and Muslims (Macedonians and Albanians, respectively) distrust and dislike each other, and have gradually grown physically apart, forming separate villages. The tensions that such feelings engender threaten to erupt into full-scale civil war at any moment  all that is left is for the fuse to be lit. When he announces at a welcoming dinner that he has come home for good, his words are met with disbelief and gentle ridicule. He is told that things have changed, which he begins to believe more and more as events progress toward what seems to be, sadly, an inevitable conclusion.

One person Aleksandar is determined to see is a woman named Hana, a former sweetheart for whom he has continued to harbor a deep love since their days in school together. He knows that she married after he was home the last time, and that she is now a widow. He has brought gifts for her, her father, and her two children as a token of respect and good will. His relatives and friends advise him to stay away from her  because shes a Muslim  but he remains headstrong. When he walks into her village, his presence is challenged by armed men from the other side of the conflict, who immediately recognize that he is not one of their own. He manages to have a visit with her father that is courteous, but strained, despite the old mans welcoming words and shared comments about the 'bad situation'. Hana brings a tray of refreshments into the room, but hardly speaks to him beyond a quiet welcome. In an almost subliminal moment, we see a young woman, Hanas daughter peering around the corner at the guest, shooed away rapidly by her brother  it is Zamira, from part one of the film. The young man, Ali, is called into the room by his grandfather and is ordered to welcome Aleksandar. Instead, he glares at the guest and asks, 'Why is he here?' When the old man insists that his grandson kiss the photographers hand, the young man instead says, Ill slit his throat. He is gruffly dismissed by his grandfather. As Aleksandar walks away from the house at the end of his visit, he stops and looks back, as if into his past  he sees Hana in a window watching him. After a poignant look is exchanged, she lets fall the sheer curtain she has held up in order to peer out, a visual reminder of the tangible veil that divides their two cultures  it seems so fragile, but it keeps them apart as if it were a brick wall.

It is during this part of the film that the incident that caused Alex to resign his position is revealed. Attached to a group of fighters in Bosnia, he had complained to their leader that he wasn't getting any action. The soldier subsequently pulled a prisoner (in a semi-Hitchcokian twist, this prisoner was portrayed by Malcho Manchevski, the director, since the assigned extra did not show up for work that day) from a line of detainees and shot him in the head in front of Aleksandar, coldly asking, Did you get that? The photographs were taken  and with that event, his life changed forever. His long-held vow not to take sides had been shattered in the space of a few seconds  if he had not killed the man directly, with his own hand, he felt responsible for the mans death, and it was too much for him to bear. He writes a letter to Anne, explaining, 'My camera killed a man. I took sides.' He tells her that the photos, copies of which he has left with her, belong to her now, not to him. He wants no more part of them, but he still bears the guilt, which hangs around his neck like an invisible millstone.

The path down the road to greater violence opens wider when Mitres brother Bojan is attacked with a pitchfork  Alex arrives at the victims house just in time to watch him die, surrounded by his grieving family. As the photographer stands in the doorway to the death room, watching Bojans life literally slip from him, his blood dripping over the edge of the bed and onto the floor, he raises one hand to his face, in an unconscious gesture that is unmistakably that of snapping a picture  complete with the click of the shutter from the absent camera. Afterward, as he and the doctor walk away, mulling the situation as it exists in the country, they encounter a party of the dead mans relatives and friends on their way to mete out their own brand of vigilante justice on a young Albanian girl who has been accused by local children after seeing her with Bojan prior to the attack. Whether the girl was even involved, or whether the attack was done in self-defense, perhaps in the face of an attempted sexual assault, is never considered. The seething prejudices cloud the air and narrow rational sight, removing any hope of objective assessment of cause and guilt, in effect pouring gasoline on smouldering embers. Aleksandar and the doctor sit to have a smoke (even though Alex has given up the habit) and ponder the situation. Hearing the medical man express his thoughts on the inevitability of the cycle of violence, Aleksandar declares, Youre as crazy as the rest of them  the doctor nods and replies, Im still herein this asylum.

That night, in a visual reprise of Kirils dream from part one, Aleksandar is seen in his bed with rain shadows on his face  he is awakened by a noise and sits up to see Hana in the room. Just as in the earlier scene, when he rubs his eyes and looks again, she is gone. A few minutes  or hours  later, he is awakened again. This time she is really there, and tells him that her daughter is missing  the very girl that the vigilantes are out to capture. She asks Alex, Dont you see what is happening here? He replies, I see. She counters with No  you just watch. When he asks what he can do, she says, Help me. As if she were your own. Hana does not go so far as to tell Alex that he is Zamiras father  but the unvoiced possibility is left hanging in the air like a scent that won't go away. The weight of its implication is in his eyes.

The next day, he goes to the sheepfold where he suspects the group is holding the girl. The same man who was seen asleep at his post outside the monastery in part one is slumbering again, with an automatic weapon in his lap, at the door. Aleksandar strides in  this shot looking very much like something John Ford might have composed  and finds her. His cousin Zdrave tries half-heartedly to stop him  Alex admonishes him for his part in this dangerous game, saying, Shame on you. Shes a child. A child. He wraps a cloak around her and begins to walk her away, with the intent of returning her to her family. As the others come to the realization that their prisoner is being taken from them, that their 'justice' is in danger of being denied, Mitre begins goading Zdrave to stop them, calling him a coward  and yet another confrontation between neighbours and relatives is set up. As the climax plays out, the Mbius timeline connects and becomes clearer  but as the director says, it is a circle with a kink, containing elements that are deliberately left in an impossible-to-connect state  more aspects for the viewer to consider.

This film is marvellous and a wonder to behold  with all of the beauty of its photography viscerally opposed to the violence that occurs or is implied, its a clear portrait of the dialectical nature of humanitys aspiration to end war and violence and its seeming inability to break the chain of death and destruction. Instead of leaving one with a mood of despair, however, it gives cause for reflection on the causes of ethnic and religious hatred, as well as consideration of ways to stop the cycle. After all, one broken link can destroy a chain. Milcho Manchevski has brought forth a true masterwork here in his first feature film. It cannot fail to move the viewer both emotionally and intellectually; it is intelligently conceived and brilliantly executed by all concerned, yet it is not so lofty a film that its message and theme are beyond the grasp of anyone. This is the first feature film shot in Macedonia after the break-up of Yugoslavia  many obstacles were encountered during production, including the sudden loss of one of the principal investors, and the project almost didn't make it to completion. It went on to win the coveted Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1994, as well as garnering a nomination as Best foreign language film at the Oscars that year. (Manchevski's latest film, Shadows, has been nominated for the 2008 Oscars in this same category.) The budget for Before the rain was comparatively small by contemporary standards  under $3 million  and several times during filming the crew had to scramble to find a way to accomplish the directors aims  but after seeing it several times, I have to say that its an unqualified success. Additionally, Criterions treatment of the DVD release is predictably laudable. This is a superb, stunningly beautiful restored digital transfer, accompanied by several special features including an informative interview with the director, as well as a revelatory second-channel commentary by him along with film critic Annette Insdorf that runs the length of the film.

This is a film that I am very pleased to have in my collection  Im sure I will return to it again and again through the years to come, with new discoveries and subtleties revealed with each viewing.
