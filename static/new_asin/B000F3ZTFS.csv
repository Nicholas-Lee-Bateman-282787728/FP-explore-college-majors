Con: Bad acting actors go through they are reading scripts no emotion, looks like make with video camera, alot to pay for 50 min movie nothing interesting on second disk unless you are in the film or a family member of someone who is. This film deserves negative stars.",1224201600,,324,4.491525423728813

Michael Reeve believes in the Wraith and on one fateful night, he comes face to face with the masked vigilante and stumbles into the Dread Avenger of the Underworld's realm of crime fighting, justice and action.

But at a great cost.

This is the sixth film by director Stephen Semones. The Wraith, created by novelist/comic book scribe Frank Dirscherl, is a story about loss and redemption, one which Semones brings to the screen nicely.

The story moves at a good clip and a lot of ground is covered in the film's 50 minutes, everything from the Wraith's origin to that of the Cobra's to Robert Latham's underworld syndicate, to Michael Reeve's dealing with the consequences of his encounter with the Wraith and the effect they have on the love of his life, Leena Patterson.

This dual-disc DVD is loaded to the brim with extras: bloopers, interviews, a special effects breakdown, commentaries, stills and more. There's also a music video, ""Home of Darkness,"" sung by Mandi Leigh.

If you dig superheroes that are more human than metahuman and stories about the same, The Wraith: Eyes of Judgment is a sure thing.

Language warning: Cursing and blasphemy

And unfortunately, it didn't seem available for me to view unless I plunked down my hard earned cash and bought it. I had it tagged as a wish item for the longest time, but I finally committed myself to its purchase. But was it worthy of buying?

It's not an excellent film by any standard. It is of an extremely low budget quality, and the acting is absolutely horrendous. But the final effect of it all is undeniably impressive. I anxiously await the future work of director Stephen Semones.

Semones had a distinct vision, and it's represented clearly on screen. There is attention to detail with the story and characters, though it's the action that stands out. The fights are well-choreographed, and proper use of slow motion adds effect to what would otherwise be a high-school play performance.

And as bad as the acting is, I can't fault the actors. The entire cast are committed to translating their roles, they just seem to lack experience in making their performances realistic. They spout lines from rote memorization.

The true testament to the film's success is that it left me wanting more. Eyes of Judgment is an origin tale, and there's a lot of build-up with no final confrontation or resolution. And I want a sequel. Hopefully, one is on the way, and hopefully Semones gets a bigger budget, because the man definitely has the chops to make a great a superhero flick.

Was it worth buying? Well, I don't regret my purchase, because its definitely worth watching.",1186704000,5,1647,4.704861111111111

I got the DVD and was immediately impressed with the packaging. How many indie filmmakers release a 2 disc set of their work and actually have it worth every penny and rival most Hollywood produced DVD's? I can tell you this, The Wraith is the first indie DVD I've seen that is actually more impressive overall than big budget blockbusters I've bought. In fact, Sir Reel Films made me feel ripped off with all the big name DVD's I've bought. They prove that you don't need a budget to make a good movie and DVD. You just need to be creative.

The movie itself is impressive, not to mention all the special features. It features 3 audio commentaries, deleted scenes, trailers, interviews, a making of documentary, premiere footage, and much, much more. I did not expect nor imagine that a film like this could be made with what Sir Reel Films had to work with. Having aquired the rights from Trinity Comics, they set out to make a comic book film based on an indie comic book from Australia. Bringing The Wraith to life onscreen was a painstaking process in which you see and hear throughout both discs in the set. Both DVD's are mixed in incredible sound and have AWESOME menus.

As a comic book fan, to be honest, I've never heard of The Wraith. After randomly picking up this film and finding out that there's also a novel and comic book based on The Wraith, and that the film has a Scriptbook & Movieguide companion book, I was shocked at how much Trinity Comics and Sir Reel Films have done for the indie scene.

Who are these guys and where did they come from? I ask this because Hollywood is about to get blindsided. This film is totally worth the purchase, and had I known about this film sooner, I would have personally submitted it to my own sites for review. There comes a film once in a while that changes your outlook on how things are done with filmmaking. I can list several examples, but trust me, The Wraith: Eyes of Judgment is one of those films. I was completely in shock at how amazing, creative, and talented the driving force behind this film was.

Long live Sir Reel Films and Trinity Comics! You guys now have a withstanding fan.
