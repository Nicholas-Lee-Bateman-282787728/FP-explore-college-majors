1343283,3,B00004RERE,"Rutger Hauer is a great actor. This movie would be nothing if it wasn't for his ability to help us suspend believe and be amusing. This may not be his best but it is certainly entertaining. Best known for his role in Blade Runner as a replicant (robot) that is hunted by Decker (Harrison Ford). He has made many other good movies. If you like him at all be sure to catch this one and Ladyhawke, Soldier of Orange, Escape from Sobibor, Wanted: Dead or Alive, Split Second, The Hitcher (not for the squemish), Deadlock, Nighthawks, and Surviving the Game.",1010361600,2,553,4.54
1343284,4,B00004RERE,"Blind Fury is still one of my favorite movies from when I was a kid.  Rutger Hauer is a great actor, but I hate to see him in (...) like Omega Doom.  I was also disappointed that I had to buy Omega with Blind Fury, hence the one star deduction.  But I am still glad I know own one of my favorite light hearted action/comedies of all time, Blind Fury.

He is capable of much more than the story lines he is given -- Blind Fury is my second pick to Ladyhawke and am looking forward to seeing Split Second [kind of far out]. Love his sword work - his acting ability -- Blind Fury is well worth seeing for the action, most of the story and entertainment value.",993168000,,420,4.329113924050633
1343286,5,B00004RERE,"I saw this film when it first came out and thought it was the second best movie to Blade Runner. Rutger Hauer plays a good role here and some very nice punch lines too. If you are a action fan then this is for you. The film is also nicely transferred to dvd and so is the sound : perfect in every way.
But my big question comes now How did they ever make a film like Omega Doom? the worst film ever produced and made in world. The story is bad,it's so rubbish that it will make you laugh so hard that the dvd will  flip out by it's own.
Frankly it's a rip-off from a Fistfull of Dollars all the same jokes are here. I also noticed that there wasn't many actors in this film. Which wouldn't have helped much.
I would give Omega Doom 0 out of 10. sorry the second film is bad,sometimes i wish the dvd studio's would stop conning the public in this 2 movies in 1 business.",964569600,4,869,3.9942528735632186

Both are good ""cult"" movies and Blind Fury especially is great fun. Omega Doom I'd likely not watch again for a while. It is a ""Dark"" movie and actually quite intelligently made, but you have to really follow it as you can lose track of what the characters are planning or doing. There are many characters , all having a role in the movie, even if their role is small. I will have to watch again, as I know I missed some things.

1343341,3,B00004RERE,"You get two movies, and had I bought either one by itself I would have been quite disappointed...especially with the first movie I watched...""Blind Fury"". I liked Houer in Blade Runner and Odessa files and others so when I saw this twin movie Rutger Houer pack I grabbed it.
  The first movie had somewhat lame dialogue, was overly acted, or under acted...you tell me. the kid was especially annoying, thus his transformation was particularly hard to believe and the kids acting was pretty unimpressive...maybe that was him, maybe the directing, maybe the story.  The whole movie seemed based on the formula of merging other successful movie ideas in the hope of making another hit. It has a touch of star wars ""Luke feel the force"" and perhaps some Karate Kid or the 70's series KUNG Fu, ""Snatch the pebble from my hand grasshopper"" and a bit of Clint Eastwood...go ahead and make my day and it even had this sort of the movie ""Shane"" swipe thrown in as well None of which were very well pulled off or particularly believable. OK sure run with it. The movie might have had better dialogue, or writing so there were many aspects pulling this down.  This story thus is more famous movies and Frankensteining them together hoping to make a hit assuming the element were the ingredients of the hits in the first place. The story really wasn't bad and had potential, but the choice of kid and even Houers acting were below par, and the story wasn't particularly well told either....coming off campy or too trite. It was disappointing, but not an especially disastrous movie...just sort of average. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars

the other movie was called Omega Doom...somewhat of a dated sort of title, and once again it had potential...but it never really quite reached it.  Special affects were not top of the line so things were more obvious as to how they were done than they should be. the movie, that is, the exposure was sometimes too dark to get exactly what was going on, so they lost possible good action with poor camera work. The story took a while to ""get"", but when you did it did the movie good...and it actually made sense. Not a bad sci fi, and it kept you guessing in some ways. Houer was definitely better in this one. ...maybe it more fit his comfort zone or whatever. He was sort of a robot Clint Eastwood...again something of a formulaic Frankensteined story.  I'd give this one 3 1/2 stars. Though I got the point of the movie, it might have been better had they told you the point in an origin so you knew what was going on as the story unfolded. but perhaps this way has it's plusses too.",1376006400,,2604,4.551282051282051

1343352,4,B00004RERE,"Omega Doom:

Nah, I don't think it's a horrible movie. Sure it lacks a lot of action that movies of the period had, but I never thought of this as an action movie anyway. It seemed to me to be more like a comic book/graphic novel meets 70's samurai movie meets spaghetti western. Despite the obvious overarching situation (apocalypse, possibility of humans returning, obvious society gone to hell), it pretty much all but ignores that and focuses on the problem at hand: ridding the robot town of the ""bad guys."" It ends with a sense that Omega Doom has really done nothing more than put a band-aid on the whole situation, but his actions are more along the lines of self-preservation than anything else. He just showed up for a drink and gets sucked into a fight. That's how pretty much any of the same genre starts. Someone comes along, wanting to be left alone, but some dumb schmuck picks a fight and then our hero has to teach them a lesson. Nothing is resolved, the world is still as crummy as it ever was, but the hero gets to get back on the road in one piece. Lather, rinse, repeat.

That's why this kind of movie appeals to me. I don't think it's boring or a waste of time. It's interesting enough in it's hopeless nothingness. I don't always want to see a happily ever after ending or some Matrix-y, save-the-human-race type of fight. Those are a dime a dozen. That's what has always appealed to me in old samurai movies, though those tend to focus more on making things better. This movie was very reminiscent of Philip K. Dick stories: bleak futures with small stories that just are what they are.

Of course this kind of movie doesn't appeal to everyone, not by a long shot. I think my little brother fell asleep. Van Damme movies were more his thing. Lots of fight scenes and the bad guys get their due. Not that I don't like those movies, I do. It's just that something of the type of movie that Omega Doom is, is a breath of fresh air. There's a pointless despair to it that I enjoy. Something is done, and yet it isn't.

Also, I know the special effects are bad, but I honestly thought it was an 80's movie. I was surprised to see 1995-1997 as a release date. I think it's much better thinking of it as an 80's movie if you're the type of person who just can't get past special effects not being as good as LotR or Star Wars.

So this gets 4 stars from me. Not the greatest, but not the worst. Despite IMDB and Amazon's plot description, it doesn't try to be anything other than it is, it fulfills my comic book/graphic novel pleasures, and I much enjoyed some of the talent in it compared to, say Van Damme.

Blind Fury:

This was much more of a Van Damme type of movie. I noticed most people who hated Omega Doom loved Blind Fury. That's fine, of course. It just goes to show that Omega Doom is the bleak, Dick-esque style of film, whereas Blind Fury is more of a revenge story in the style of Universal Soldier. I liked Blind Fury fine, but those kinds of movies are a dime a dozen. Yes, there was a lot of action, but after getting out of my Van Damme and Stallone phase, it occurred to me that action sequences aren't something to base a movie on. If it can run in the background while I'm cleaning house or reading a book and I still understand the entire movie and don't miss a thing, then it's nothing more than background noise. If I have to pay attention to it to catch the subtleties, then it's a movie I'm going to enjoy and watch.

I still can't tell the difference between most of those Van Damme movies. Same plot, same storyline. Somehow he's wronged, a friend is wronged, blah blah, and has to go lay a smackdown on someone. Someone shoot me now because the world doesn't need any more of them and could use a few more Omega Dooms (with better production values, of course).

Yes, I liked Blind Fury. I just liked Omega Doom more. I'm a bit of a comic and dystopian scifi geek. Of course I liked Omega Doom better. My brother is a martial arts and action movie geek. Of course he liked Blind Fury better.",1152489600,,4039,4.3179419525065965
1343353,3,B00004RERE,"Blind Fury is a very good if simple movie. I just could not get into Omega Doom. It had some promise, But never followed through on it.

1343354,5,B00004RERE,"BLIND FURY IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE BY RUTGER

OMEGA DOOM IS DIFFERENT- GOOD MOVIE
""LOVED THE HEAD"" !!!!!",1073433600,,141,4.68
1343355,4,B00004RERE,"I always enjoy watching a movie with Rutger Hauer in the cast. He is a good, sometimes great, actor who often appears in low-grade junk. Moviegoers know him from such stand out films as ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Hitcher,"" but he is quite capable of turning in excellent performances in movies that, for all intensive purposes, reek. Some movie fans would probably castigate Hauer more than I would for making so many B films, and they would be right to some extent, but at least when this actor shows up in schlock you know you will see something interesting. If you have any doubt as to Hauer's acting skills, look no further than an obscure little film made a few years ago called ""Fatherland."" There is a scene in that movie where Hauer's character tells his son a story about a watchmaker that comprises one of the most powerful moments I have ever seen in a film. My admiration for this wonderful actor prompted me to recently view this Rutger Hauer double feature DVD. The two films on the disc are 1989's ""Blind Fury"" and 1995's ""Omega Doom.""
""Blind Fury"" is the more recognizable of the two films. Hauer plays Nick Parker, a recently returned Vietnam veteran who went blind due to a combat injury. Afterwards, Parker spent years living in a Vietnamese village learning how to cope with his disability. Several of the men in the settlement taught Parker how to use a sword by relying on his sense of hearing, and through this training the former soldier knows how to get around quite well in the world. Parker's first goal on returning to the United States is to visit his old war buddy Frank Devereaux, a man supposedly living in Florida with his wife and young son. What Nick doesn't know is that his old friend left his family and now faces a heap of trouble after losing at the roulette wheel from a gambling tycoon in Las Vegas. The baddies want Devereaux, a chemist by trade, to whip up a batch of designer drugs that will help the tycoon keep his casino out of the hands of creditors. In order to persuade Frank to help them, the goons attempt to abduct his wife and child. A series of events beginning with Parker's arrival on his friend's doorstep culminates with a showdown between the blind man and Devereaux's enemies in Vegas. Nick also manages to bond with his buddy's son and find some closure about his disability.
""Blind Fury"" is a fun movie, loaded with lots of shoot 'em up violence, nifty swordplay, and great character actors. Along for the ride with Hauer are Randall ""Tex"" Cobb as the right hand baddie of the tycoon, Terry O'Quinn as Parker's hapless war buddy, Meg Foster in a small role as O'Quinn's wife, and Nick Cassavetes as one of the thugs pursuing Parker. There are more recognizable faces in this movie than there are at a family reunion. Everybody does a good job with their roles, especially Hauer, who looks like he is having a heap of fun playing a blind guy who can wield a sword, drive a van, and generally beat up bad guys. Sure, there are plot holes you can sail a battleship through: why does the tycoon shell out big bucks to hire a sword-wielding assassin if he faces bankruptcy? Moreover, wouldn't be easier to just give up on Devereaux once the trouble with Parker starts instead of sending out waves of hired thugs to kill Nick and Devereaux's family? I could pick ""Blind Fury"" apart on point after point, but I really don't want to. I liked the movie and if you enjoy Hauer, you will too.
""Omega Doom"" comes from the mind of Albert Pyun, a schlock director who occasionally manages to produce something worthwhile (see ""Nemesis"" and ""The Sword and The Sorcerer"" for proof of this claim). In the case of this 1995 Hauer vehicle, Pyun finds himself on shaky ground with a low budget rip-off of the spaghetti western genre set in an apocalyptic future where androids and cyborgs rule most of the planet. Hauer plays Omega Doom, a robot soldier who fought against the armies of the human race before receiving a wound to the head that destroyed his memory. Reconfigured by surviving humans, Omega Doom now roams the wastelands of America hunting down troublesome gangs of robots. The entire movie takes place in one or two buildings in a wasted city, where two groups of robots called droids and roms square off over the rumor of a huge cache of firearms. Both groups wish to acquire guns so they can deal with the potential threat of a renewed offensive by human beings. Omega Doom proceeds to play both groups of robots off of one another while killing off the more hostile machines. Pyun uses the robot characters to examine philosophical questions about destiny, change, and existence. This film is far from great, but it isn't nearly as bad as many people say.
Action fans will likely be disappointed with ""Omega Doom,"" as will those viewers looking for lots of flashy special effects. The fact that the ""killer"" robots resemble Go-Go's guitarist Jane Wieldin with a bad case of vitiligo will certainly cause more laughs than anything else, and the robot known as ""The Head"" is downright offensive on every level. But if you accept this lack of conventional sci-fi attributes along with a few laughable scenes and cheesy effects, you might just enjoy ""Omega Doom."" Between ""Omega Doom"" and ""Blind Fury,"" I think I can recommend this DVD. The picture quality of both films looks good, and extras include a Hauer talent bio and three trailers. Rutger Hauer fans will enjoy this disc.",1066780800,18,5436,4.645898234683282
1343356,3,B00004RERE,"While ""Blind Fury"" is certainly a good movie, if you're looking for something in the ""kick butt"" genre, it drags a little, attempting to rely too much on ""charming"" interaction between Hauer and his bratty costar than the action. Hauer should have been allowed more action scenes, and given more comedic lines. The young boy character is too much of a brat, and though I'm sure they were attempting to make him ""impish"", he's more simply foul and annoying. The film's a good one for a lazy summer afternoon when nothing else is on.
""Omega Doom"", on the other hand, is probably better for a cold, rainy day when you're tired of your other DVDs. It's almost painfully low-budget, and considering the silliness that takes place in it, it could be great. Unfortunately, the silliness comes off as mostly unintentional, and the film seems to take itself almost deadly serious, to the point where something that could have been a huge laugh merely becomes vaguely discomfiting because it's creepy, but not really enjoyable-creepy a la Return of the Living Dead.
I'd say this two-pack is worth it, especially if you buy a used copy for less than the regular price. Just don't expect these to be anything other than ""slow programming day on the minidish"" features.",1056153600,,1256,4.819444444444445
7921096,2,B00004RERE,"Rutger Hauer is an excellent actor and anyone who has seen his performances in films such as Blade Runner, Escape From Sobibor or Ladyhawke knows he has not always had the opportunities to display his talents.

Both these films prove this out. Omega Doom is a terrible Sci Fi flick about killer androids against the human race in which Hauer plays an android who has lost his programming and seeks to destroy the android combatants. In Blind Fury, Hauer stars in an obvious Zatoichi ripoff about a blind swordsman who must safeguard the son of an old comrade from the clutches of evil, drug-dealing casino operators!

These are clearly ""B"" movies Rutger starred in because he needed the money at the time and couldn't afford to be choosey. Clearly, he isn't at his best in these dreadful scripts and despite a few memorable scenes his effort simply isn't very good.

Despite the low price for the double feature, this isn't worth the money. Two stars.",1526169600,,951,4.751515151515152
