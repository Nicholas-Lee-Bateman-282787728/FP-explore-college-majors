3038820,1,B000Z961UO,"I was initially curious when I saw the title and was hopeful this documentary would show ignorant people that the world would be better off without the U.S. interfering. After the first few minutes, I realized that this was preaching something else.  I agree that turmoil and conflicts are terrible, but this movie makes no qualms about pulling at the viewer's heartstrings to getting the viewer brainwashed into thinking we MUST be involved in everything around the world otherwise people will die and the world will fall apart without the U.S. This show only tries to justify our war efforts.

This documentary does not show the dark side of the U.S.'s ""help"".  Installing of dictators, killing of hundreds of civilians (including children) in an effort for ""peace"" via drone bombings (50 civilians for every 1 terrorist they kill), economic sanctions to starve millions of people that aren't involved with their government's ""evil acts"", and using the Al Qaeda, our supposed enemies, for terrorism against other middle eastern countries like Syria.

If people were smart, they'd realize we are essentially doing what Russia was doing in the 70's and 80's and be outraged.  Although this documentary showed how much the U.S. spends on its military, it does not give the viewer any indication of where it will lead if we continue to ""protect"" the rest of the world, like bankruptcy.

3038823,4,B000Z961UO,"A case for the status quo, or is it? This film makes a good case for its more altruistic motivations , ie I did not know that much about Kuwait charging the US liberators the same price as all else for its oil; or Saddam Hussein's offer of $10 a barrel oil as long as he lived if the US looked the other way while Kuwait and Saudi Arabia felt his tenderness of T-72  invasionary tanks.

I already knew how weak Europe is militarily. In WW1 they could send enough men out in to the battlefield to lose upwards of 800,000 people (Britain 886,939, France 1,397,800, Germany 2,050,897) yet with greater population densities than they had in 1914, Europe combined could only send pathetic squab forces to the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990's.  And these ""peacekeeping"" forces were forbidden from shooting at the belligerents which were massacring civilians even as the peacekeepers looked on.  That is until the US intervened and tidied it all up for them.

I have conflicting feelings about this, Europe might be forced learn something if the US stayed out, spent that defense money on bridges in Minnesota while the Yugoslav conflict ""burned out.""  Millions more would die horribly of course, lost while Europe debates the best course of action about the morality of having men serve in their armed forces and sending them somewhere to get shot at while they attempted to uphold the human rights of an oppressed population which was not their own.  Or just accept what was done as the right decision, the US intervened bombed and sent troops while the other major powers all about wrung their hands in indecision.

With their wealth, the film makes me think about, yes, it would seem Europe should take care of its own defense business as they seem to hate Uncle Sam with a passion, yet anything which requires a tank or a battleship, Europeans are clueless to proceed, crying ""uncle.""  This film was produced in 2008 and with the current worsening economic climate, expecting Europe to spend some money to defend itself ever seems more remote.

The ending of the film, with its suggestion about a possible Chinese reaction to a Japan nuclear arming without the US, does seem a bit over the top.  But then again, hatreds of those two nations run deep, passionately and have been longstanding.  Japan's recent nuclear accident will most certainly place it even further from considering a nuclear deterrent (as if they were ever remotely considering it).

Five stars minus one for the President Turner intro.  I think they should have approached this as either an informative documentary or a story, but both together did not mesh that well",1346544000,2,2630,4.789823008849558

3038825,4,B000Z961UO,"Ending of this (by nuclear bomb) seems propagandistic and using too much fear undermine quality of this document.

Also I was surprised, when in Bosnia case author didn't mention Tudjman-Milosevic contract and tell that bosnians were muslims, serbs orthodox, but doesnt mention catholic croatians which takes also part in this war.

And China was little bid demonized.

On the second hand I like that part about middle east, especially focus on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait (which many people seems to forgot) and mentioning, that Sadam offered cheaper oil to the US.

It is not really detailed, but I know that, when I was buying this. Its more like introductiomn to this question.

My rating is something between 3-4 stars, but I don't see much documentaries about this issue, so because of that I would like to rate this by 4 stars.",1318550400,,835,4.852112676056338
3038826,1,B000Z961UO,"The video examines the question ""what would happen if the US withdrew its forces from all foreign bases?"".  Sadly, the authors  had picked an answer before they examined the question.  Their answer is ""nation would make war upon nation...perish the thought"".  The slick but shallow presentation is a pastiche of images of nasty people and of bad things that have happened (or might happen) plus a collection of sound bites from individuals who are supposed to be offering expert opinion but who, with rare exceptions, are sorely lacking in depth of insight.

The shallowness is a pity because the topic is actually interesting.  The authors posit a US withdrawing from its global bases because a presidential candidate bases his campaign on a promise to do so.  This assumption is illustrative of the central weakness of the video, a lack of both knowledge and imagination.

All imperial nations create within the homeland a military-commercial complex as well as a hyper-nationalist political wing, which together sustain the imperialist cause and are together are virtually unstoppable in ordinary times. This combination, in any state, is more powerful than any one politician, thus great powers only withdraw from empires when compelled to do so by total military defeat or by economic eclipse.

Now, the US is geographically protected from the likelihood of defeat, so the only plausible cause for a global US withdrawal would be an economic one.  Would it be a sudden collapse, or a slow eclipse?  One can only speculate, but the key point is that the cause of of a US retreat would be as consequential as the retreat itself.  If the US cedes its position as the world's biggest importer, biggest borrower, biggest economy and issuer of the main trading currency then there will be changes afoot in world affairs even before the first GI comes home.  A knowledgeable commentator could have given a very engaging talk on the possibilities that arise in such a situation.

Which leads me to the other big weakness, the lack of imagination.  The authors show a world where except for the US withdrawal no other great power radically changes its policy and no major political alliances shift.  Europe,we are assured,is forever pacifist, the same Europe whose driving policy was militant nationalism for centuries up to 1945.  The authors never had the humility to realize that predicting the political future is at best a suggestion of what is possible.  The wrote a prophecy instead.

A professor wishing to illustrate a course in political commentary might find this video useful, in the way same way a professor of pathology would use a diseased organ.  For all others, a waste of time.",1295049600,10,2691,5.004494382022472
3038827,5,B000Z961UO,"It is very difficult to find contrarian documentaries to balance the one-sided viewpoints frequently doled out by PBS, et al, but this video does it in spades.  It is a most welcome look, from a truly international perspective, at what the costs would be if the United States were to withdraw from world affairs and drastically cut its military budget, positions that are argued by more than a few members of Congress.  After the President's remark earlier this year that ""whether we like it or not, we remain a dominant military superpower,"" this video helps to explain the costs if we failed to act like that superpower.  Mitch Anderson drew on a solid base of expertise in putting this documentary, including that of the the distinguished historian, Niall Ferguson, whose Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire would make an excellent companion volume to this superb video.",1292889600,5,888,4.946308724832215
3038828,1,B000Z961UO,The producer of this rationalization of US global military dominance is a very conservative Roman Catholic evangelizing organization called Deepwater productions.  Check out their web site and view the DVD with LOTS of awareness of its strong bias.,1284854400,4,248,5.526315789473684
3038829,1,B000Z961UO,"""The Ascent of Money,"" which Nial Ferguson spearheaded, positioned the ""free market"" as the answer to all social and economic problems around the world. In this manner, it offered a narrow critique of the world situation. It did however provide a useful historical run-down of the financial world.
Not so much of use in ""The World Without Us."" Ferguson is offered up as the go-to guy here as well. As a British intellectual elite working as a pointman for the maintenance of American world hegemony, he points out European ""hypocrisy"" but never challenges the historical hypocrisy of American foreign policy. He and other ""experts"" interviewed here, focus on the realpolitik consequences of what would happen throughout the world if the U.S. were to remove it's military omnipresence from the world's hot spots or potential hotspots.
They choose to entertain the idea as if it might take place only as an all at once or precipitous withdrawl of troops and assistance, rather than the only way it could take place within the confines of our chugging ""democracy""; as a sensible, progressive removal based on long-term economic, moral and political assesments. In this way, they set the idea up for a fall.
The cover design of the dvd makes it appear as if it were a drama of a sort, with the fictional President's photo in the forefront. But the production of his campaign to convince voters of the importance of drawing back from our Imperial position is, at best, a farce. They must have budgeted about sixty dollars for this section of the documentary. The candidate, we'll assume he is a liberal Democrat (the only type who would propose such an anti-American idea, after all), is seen in high school classroom sized venues surrounded by crowds upward of fifteen supporters. Why so chintzy with the production values? Is it to show that this candidate, who is presented as the mainstream choice for his party for the Presidency, would attract only a few supporters with his cockamamie ideas? But he is a major candidate - not Mike Huckabee! The very premise of the program is that the idea has support (albeit from the gullible populace that the dvd is trying to sway otherwise by talking down to them as if they were infant children).
The candidate is presented as essentially a straw-man to critique. His manner and presentation are an amalgam of the worst of Democratic candidates such as Gore, Clinton and Kerry. He is a smooth talker who appears to lack any authenticity as a person or any personal zeal for the issue on which he has apparently hung his entire candidacy. If this sounds like an indictment of liberal Presidential candidates, it is because that is what it is. But it is also to say that the producers of the dvd either purposely or subconciously made the candidate and his candidacy laughable, and that it is pointedly liberal laughable. In point of fact, a liberal candidate has not and never would campaign on such a preposterous idea of immediate, full-scale withdrawl of military personnel from throughout the world; only a right-wing guy like Ron Paul or Pat Buchanan would try to put something out there like that. So why does the documentary not present this kind of candidate for our perusal? Because then we enter into gray areas of political ideology that induce the viewer to actually do some independant thinking. And this production does not encourage that. It is, instead, pure propaganda that I can use as an example of the technique to my high school students.",1280188800,9,3499,4.852842809364549
3038830,4,B000Z961UO,"I could not have been happier and prouder as an American.  The
documentary cleared some doubts I had especially in regard to our involvement in
liberating Kuwait. Now I am even more convinced that it is not for our own
selfish interests we the American taxpayers and especially our brave soldiers
make the sacrifices but we do want those deprived of freedom to experience it.

3038831,3,B000Z961UO,"Perhaps a more accurate title would have been ""Why American Taxpayers Should Continue to Pay More than Six Billion Dollars a Year to Play Policeman to the World, (and saddle future generations with a tax burden by borrowing money we don't actually have)"".  This mini-epic is on a par, production-wise, with Frank Capra's classics of war propaganda ""Why We Fight"".  Both are geared to preserving the status quo, no questions asked.  And while both are well done, I take serious issue with them both.

This movie tries to portray the U.S.'s military presence and interventions around the world, over the past 20 years, as being ultimately altruistic and moral, rather than self-serving, wrong-headed, and calamitous.  It totally ignores General Smedley Butler's experienced conclusion that ""War is a Racket"", and Eisenhower's warning that the growing influence of the military-industrial complex threatens to ruin American democracy.

And while the film did make several good points about very real threats in the world (racial genocide, radical religious fundamentalists, and an increasingly militarized China), it fails to note the U.S.'s political addiction to keeping several evil boogey-men in power, in order to frighten over-trusting Americans, and justify exorbitant defense expenditures.

The point of this review is not to argue the issues raise by this impressive piece of propaganda, but to warn unsuspecting viewers who might not be aware of the film's sins of omission and outright attempts at manipulation.",1276819200,21,1519,5.438297872340425
3038832,3,B000Z961UO,"The good: Well researched. Niall Ferguson is always entertaining and thought provoking.
The bad: the commentator has a heavy accent - not the best choice as an orator. The film offers 6 language sub-title options: none of them work.
Niall Ferguson's participation is maybe a total of less than 10 minutes; I had expected more based on the reviews.
As the first reviewer mentions, the film starts with a personal background, which I found irrelevant and would skip.",1269820800,,464,4.961538461538462
3038833,1,B000Z961UO,"This doc is an unnervingly simplified look at recent history, from WW2 and beyond. Watching this, you are left with the impression that without the power of the US military in your backyard, you would be quickly overrun by freedom-hating communists who want to arrest all business owners and lock up your family, or by Muslim extremists who want nothing more than to rule the world, by way of decapitating Jews and infidels. Now, back to reality. About 12 years ago, when I was becoming aware of the world in which we live, I found a book by Richard Pipes (I had NO idea who he was then) called ""Communism: a History"", hoping to learn about the history of communism. What I got was possibly the most blatantly biased book, with little-to-no worldly context included, that I have ever read, and even with my most basic knowledge of things, I knew when I was being told far less than the whole story. At the end of this film, despite what should have been a compelling theme, I was left with a similar feeling. Now, I know you can't include everything in an hour ad a half running time, but to make NO mention of the more than 50 US interventions of sovereign nations around the world, by their own hand or by proxy, since WW2 (which show why a lot of these areas are in such a mess and 'need' US 'help'), is to completely eviscerate any kind of balance that would have made this film credible. To still sprout the myth of the good ""humanitarian"" attacks on the former Yugoslavia during the 90's without even a whisper of US support of one faction against another (the support of Croatia's Tudjman, a nazi admirer and holocaust down-player being just one case in point) which inflamed an already combustible region to the inevitable break-up of the only remaining ""successful""  socialist state in Europe, is in my book being far from candid. And what of US creation of Jihadists in Afghanistan against the Soviets in 1979 (read: origins of al-quaeda and Osama)? What about the overthrow of the democratic Mossadegh, who wanted to spend oil profits on his own people, in Iran in 1953? (leading the the Shah, leading to the Iranian clerics)? What about Vietnam? the bombing of Cambodia that led to Pol Pot? Arming Saddam Hussein and then invading Iraq twice, which, along with a decade of sanctions has killed well over a million Iraqis? No mention of the Kuwaiti  oil market manipulation which led to less Iraqi oil profits to rebuild their country after the terrible decade-long war with Iran (which was of course kept going by US arms shipments to both sides) and slant-drilling practices of Kuwait. We are also fed the most absurd line that the US is not in the middle east for oil, because the US gets most of it's supplies from other regions!! Ever consider that you don't have to physically use the oil to profit from it??? Control is everything. Haiti? El Salvador? Nicuragua? no mention. South America does get a segment in the extras section, and by way of showing what can happen to a country that does not have US support/intervention, we are told by a daughter of Fidel Castro that Cuba HAS hardly any electricity, water, or medical aid. She then mentions that this was when she left there in 1993, probably the lowest period of post-revolutionary Cuba after the death of their trading partners the USSR. NO MENTION of the 50+ year US blockade since the revolution, which, because of US influence, is mostly a blanket blockade (and of course no mention of the rebuilding of Cuba since then). The films' ending especially shows us the filmmakers' blatant message to the world: by giving us a prophetic and very dramatic future scene of a Japanese city after nuclear attack by China, all because the US has packed up and gone home (hey, didn't the US already drop atomic bombs on Japanese cities during the 'good war'?? With friends like these...) we are left in no doubt. The list goes on in regards to what is missing from this film in order to give us a fair assessment of what could happen in the fascinating scenario of the US in fact bringing all it's military home. Yes, the world is a place of dangerous conflicts, but it is a world full of contradictions and subtext, and in no way as simple as the films outcome of 'they will enslave and kill us all without the honorable USA'. The world of international relations is of course a complicated place, but most of what proves that is remarkably absent in this film.  Please forgive the ramble, but this sort of obfuscation of the important facts just makes me kind of mad. And don't get me wrong, I like a lot of the US influence on the world, just not the overthrowing of elected governments, installing/supporting of dictators, bombing, killing children, economic strangulation, etc. Does that really make me anti-American? Forget this film, and read some books instead.",1243382400,32,4836,4.653801169590643
3038834,3,B000Z961UO,"It is refreshing to see someone taking a pro-military point of view with a rational argumentation and a human perspective rather than blind and numbing statements like we got accustomed to in the last years (""freedom, democracy, ..""). This movie is not an ""objective documentary""; but it adds to the discussion.

To be fair, a whole series would have to be made: yes to answer questions about Africa; South-America where American interference has had less positive impacts; about Iraq which was conveniently skimed in the movie (apart for the Gulf War, easier to justify); and even inconditional support for Israel (though the movie dares question and suggest a change of policy on this through the voice of a Kuweiti).

So yes this movie supports the use of American military for global peace and stability by focusing on the good examples where it has been used with some success and conflict prevention in mind. We need part two where we cover the cases when it is not so successful and the part where we really look at what we could do if indeed all this money and human resource was spent on health, environment and education globally - often the root of a lot of conflicts - instead of military equipment.

Oh yes the ending is terrible. No need to play the fear card, the arguments and interviews were enough.",1238889600,6,1316,4.737991266375546
3038835,1,B000Z961UO,"The program started off promising, but ended up naiive and biased.  The part dealing with Taiwan is particularly problematic. The director has deliberately ignored the fact that almost half of all Taiwanese do want some form of reunification with China. The newly elected Taiwanese Government is also pro-reunification, and has allowed direct flights between China and Taiwan for the first time in history. PRC citizens are now allowed to travel freely to Taiwan. The reason for all this is that Taiwan has realized it cannot survive economically without PRC. And the US hasn't been much help either. Look at where Hillary Clinton visited on her recent visit to Asia - PRC was the first stop whilst Taiwan was not even on the agenda.  Seems like the US cares more about selling her debts than upholding democratic values. Furthermore, repeatedly addressing Taiwan as a country even though the United Nations does not recognize it as yet is inaccurate too.  I have no opinion regarding the renunification issue, but I think this 'documentary' should at least address both sides of the issue. It also tries to explain the Chinese mindset from a Western stempoint, which is unfair to the non-chinese viewer.
The last part where China sets off a nuclear bomb in Tokyo (Japan), not Taiwan as some earlier reviewers assumed, is, well, laughable. Yes, its Japan, not Taiwan.",1237075200,12,1367,5.013215859030837

So when I heard of this dvd I picked it up thinking that it might be an interesting topic to explore.  The documentary is horrible though.  Forget saying it's fear mongering for neocons, this film is just plain bad.  The movie is done cheaply and with a poor narration that makes you question its integrity from the start.  The movie then gets into different conflicts the U.S. has been in recently and different areas it has troops stationed.  The doc. clearly insists that without U.S. participation in the world everyone would go to war instantly.  I could go on and on about the problems with this movie but the biggest problem is that it never explains what would actually happen.  It doesn't talk about Russia or China moving to take a hegemonic role or the EU stepping up around the world.  It just carries on speaking on isolated incidences in regions and NEVER speaks of a broader picture.  And the people it has commentating the film are a joke.

While I was at the G.I. Film Festival in Washington D.C., I had the opportunity to meet Mitch Anderson, creator of the documentary film, ""The World Without Us"".

The film follows the fictional presidential campaign of a candidate named Turner, who vows when elected to bring home the entire U.S. Military from every country it is deployed to. As Turner says in the film, The United States spends countless sums of money that could be better spent at home. Elect him, and the world will think the U.S. is a nice place, and our troops won't get killed. Right?

Wrong. ""The World Without Us"" is a brilliant film that shows why the United States and its military are crucial to world peace today. Mitch Anderson traveled to over 20 countries to speak with people about their thoughts of the U.S. and its missions worldwide. The responses he gets from people are varied but honest. It is interesting to see what other, regular people think about the U.S. worldwide.

Anderson also interviews noted Harvard historian and author Niall Ferguson. I have always enjoyed reading Ferguson, and he hits the nail on the head when he says in the trailer, ""The World is not naturally a peaceful, organized place..... and my great fear is that if the U.S. opts out (of maintaining order) maybe no one will opt in.""

Not only is the film relevant to all Americans curious about their nation's role in the world on the geopolitical level, it is also the story of the hope that is America. Mitch Anderson weaves his own story into the film, and it is the story of countless people that have come to America seeking a better life. Anderson was born in Communist Romania during the Cold War and dreamed of escaping and coming to the United States. Knowing he will be thrown in prison if he is caught trying to leave, he eventually he escapes his homeland and makes it to the United States. As a man that lived under the evil of communism, it is easy to see why he loves the United States, and why he is the best type of American- he knows what the price of freedom is, having lived under its alternative.

""The World Without Us"" is a great documentary showing exactly what the consequences could be if the United States were to shirk its duty in the world. It is natural, probably, for those protesters we have here at home to not like the U.S. Military being sent abroad. They don't like war, and don't like suffering. It is a testament to the United States' success that our citizens can afford to be so naive- maybe if they watched this film they might think twice.",1215216000,6,2553,4.539130434782609
3038845,5,B000Z961UO,"Review :
""The World without US"" feature film documentary asks a question that is on the back of our minds and yet we rarely take time to find the answer.  This film presents the answer with an abundance of researched material and a first hand experience to boot.

The producer grew up under the yoke of Communism! When Hitler rose up  and brought the most relentless cruelty and viciousness called the NAZI party along with him, we should have been there to stop him before he crossed the border into Poland. That is what this film brings to light. This film serves out valuable information on a silver platter.

It is information that should be in the conscious mind of all the world's citizens. The American military presence around the world is forcing all the tyrants and tyrannical governments to think twice.

Everywhere our military presence is not located, the tyrants are taking over. This film is a ""wake up call"" like no other. It was not made by a special interest group or a corporate entity or the industrial/military complex.  It was made by someone who truly has a worldview. Made by a man who has lived through tyrants and tyrannical governments. The power of the message hits you almost immediately and takes the viewer on an insightful ride through our immediate history. The scenes are unique, and have rarely been seen by American audiences.

This is a film about a subject that not only happened years ago, it is happening right now.

The music score is powerful and the full message is there for all to learn. This film is for the ""thinking"" American and will keep you thinking way past the end.

A ""must see"" is an understatement.

3038846,1,B000Z961UO,"I was very disappointed, and really rather disgusted with this - I found it to be nothing but an apology for a neo-con World Empire supported by US world aggression - using terror and scenes of terror to support the argument. The premise is that since there will always be war we (our army and their supporting corporations and our taxes) should police all of it. If I watched Fox News, I would expect soon to see this there if it has not already been shown there. There is much mention of our need for oil and how it is ok for our corporations to grab oil for our economy but no mention at all of Peak Oil (when the oil demand outstrips the supply - we are there or soon to be there), the condition that we are preparing for by our aggression, or to the fact that we use our military power to take the resources from the victim country by paying only the elites (who then deposit the cash in the monetary system we control), if we pay anybody, and strip resources without benefiting the local people who do the work. A Pie-in-the-Sky report by a spokesman who says he is a Romanian who was oppressed by the Soviets who is either a starry eyed idealist, a well paid pro-Bush apologist - or just a not very good actor. Simplistic representation equating our costly presence on bases with nuclear deterrence without mention that nuclear deterrence on our enemies in this world would still be possible even if our bases no longer existed. Would our bases be used to launch nuclear weapons or are they there to control local populations when necessary? The film ends with a terror-provoking vision of Taiwan destroyed by a nuclear China due to the closure of our bases in Japan - as if we need bases to protect Japan. And absolutely no mention of the democracies that we have undermined in favor of dictatorships. I'm sorry I have to give this one star in order to write a review - If you support Bush and his neo-cons you will love this - otherwise pass on...",1202428800,14,1956,4.406077348066298

The basic concept being what would happen to the world if the United States decided to bring the troops home. Which in itself is a good question to ask. While it takes a dark look at the world and it could be proved wrong. As history can never be counted upon to do what is predicted. Th evidence presented argues strongly that things could get very messy and bloody very fast.
  What with an impotent Europe that has lost the will to fight. The Tribalism of the Middle East that has a growing population that does like the ways are things done & other resentments. The Asians that is still armed to the teeth and has its own hatreds and resentments towards each other. Altogether its not a pretty picture.

3038848,1,B000Z961UO,"I got an open mind.  I watched the whole thing.  It's basically an ""analysis"" of what the world would be like without the U.S. military being stationed and intervening around the world.

What a neo-con fantasy!  You can tell it's pretty much government propaganda just due to how slick the production is.  They snookered some Romanian dude to narrate the thing to play the ""oh, I suffered under the Russians"" victim act.  That's a tip off right there - the old Cold War mentality.  (If the Russians are no longer a threat to Europe, why are we still there?  Russia withdrew its troops.  When will we?)  The depth of analysis was about as much as a Faux News sound bite.  They would go so far and then not take the next logical step.  Then, they have this ""PhD"" Niall Ferguson from Oxford who continues to paint us as the Second Coming.  Again, no real analysis of events.  They would interview a couple Europeans for the opposing viewpoint and play German oomph-pah bands in the background.  Hilarious!  No mention of the CIA in assassinations, revolutions and general messing up of countries around the world so that we can get good prices on bananas in American supermarkets.  The Palestinian issue gets mentioned and then a bunch of clips showing radical Islamic clerics shouting about ""killing Jews"" (if that's what the translation really was; we know how that works; we've seen it enough).  And then it's dropped.  I bust out laughing during the use of Korean propaganda films to show how dangerous the North Koreans are.  (A propaganda film using someone else's propaganda films and taking them at face value; please, my sides are hurting.)  No mention that the two halves of Korea were having meetings about uniting but the United States kept foiling it.  And then to top it all off, at the end, they played an excerpt from some Asian soap opera where they hinted that China had set off a nuclear bomb over Taiwan and people were dying and if only the U.S. Cavalry had come to the rescue.  (Of course, how human beings are walking around and having conversations after being smacked by a nuke is beyond me.)  So, Niall's analysis of it all is that the American people should just suck it up and keep paying the military bills.  Well, thanks to these traitors, the country will be bankrupt and probably blown up from blowback, and then the world, in the end, will be without us.",1201478400,16,2384,4.645933014354067

The perspective, taken from the eyes of a contemporary immigrant to the US, retains admiration and appreciation for the priviliges and responsibilities that are inherent with being ""imperialists of human rights"".  In a time when it is popular to bash America, this is a refreshingly ballsy reminder of how much opportunity we enjoy, and paradoxically, that where much is given to us much is expected from us.
The documentary is thought provoking, an honest scrutiny of the complexities of international relations. One will gain a deeper understanding and a more profound realization of our role in the world--that our position in the world is not merely selfish and self serving but benefits billions of people the world over.

First, it has a perspective not often seen in our country, namely, that the U.S. is basically a good place that tries to do good things in the world.  It will definitely be a conversation starter.  I recommend you watch it alone first and then watch it with people who don't hold the same political views as you do.  I made the mistake of watching it with a devout Bush hater the first time and couldn't get all the way through the movie because we got into such a heated argument.  While I'm no Bush apologist I don't think he is like Hitler.
One of the things I like about the film is that it was done by a naturalized citizen who is originally from Romania.  He knows what it's like to live and suffer under a truly oppressive regime and therefore understands that the U.S. is nothing like that despite leftist rhetoric to the contrary.  My favorite part of the film was the coverage of the Balkan War.  I always felt we did too little too late but I had no idea how ineffectual and damaging the European involvement was.  Another highlight is the interview with Castro's daughter and of course the polished dramatizations of the fictional presidential candidate who vows to remove U.S. troops from foreign countries.  This is particularly poignant in the current election year with all the candidate posturing we're forced to witness.  I wonder what this fictional candidate's opponent would say in response to his plan to close military bases worldwide.",1200873600,4,1524,4.649253731343284
3038852,5,B000Z961UO,"For over a century, the United States has been the greatest source on the globe of aid and assistance to troublespots, ranging from war to natural disasters to the proactive provision of defense to both allies and less warm friends.  All the while, too many recipients of this largesse wantonly criticize the United States and bemoan its position as the last superpower, though they rarely decline to continue to accept America's generosity.

This film juxtaposes the simplicity of American populists who call for cessation of our international activities with the potential horrors that could arise if this country chose to withdraw and allow the various powers of evil to run rampant, reminiscent of the 1930s when Germany, Japan, and Italy conquered great swaths of the map.  this documentary also brings Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged to mind as the stability of the world is shown to be so precarious without America's forthright wilingness to intervene in locales that the average citizen could not find on the map, ranging from the military action in the genocide perpetrated in the aftermath of Yugoslavia's dissolution to the bulwark the US provides in defending North Korea from destroying South Korea.

While the message is essentially simple,it is a story that must be told as both Americans and citizens of countries around the world should be aware that a world without the United States would be a cycle of chaos and totalitarian regimes, as unchecked evil would have no compunction to repeat the dark deeds that history is replete with.  Edmund Burke famously observed that ""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.""  America has filled that vacuum.

3038855,5,B000Z961UO,"I was interested in watching this documentary, but it was even more thought-provoking than I expected.  It starts off with a fictional ""Turner for President"" ad in which a candidate Turner promises to withdraw most of our troops from the world and focus solely on domestic issues.  This seems simple at first, but then the film dives into why this is such a complicated topic -- what if the US really DID do that?  What would the affect on the world really be?

The producer and narrator, Mitch Anderson, goes on a journey around the world seeking answers, but first telling his own story of coming to America after escaping Soviet oppression.  He had grown up hearing about ""Mr. Truman and Mr. Eisenhower,"" and how his family hoped they would return to free Eastern Europe from Soviet oppression -- but they never did.  Mitch takes his journey, thoughts, and themes seriously and yet with care and conviction.  There is input from everyone from former US Ambassadors to Bosnian citizens to a North Korean escapee, and many more.  The cheif anchor of the documentary is Niall Ferguson, PhD (professor of history at Oxford University is just one of his credits), who adds thoughtful and well-spoken thoughts.

The documentary asks many tough questions, and it receives answers from people of many varying cultural backgrounds.  The conclusions it draws are not always complete (because there are not always easy answers), but they usually make sense, even when they are surprising.  I was reminded of some of the conflicting thoughts myself and some friends had after watching the excellent film ""Hotel Rwanda.""  Some of my friends who are opposed to U.S. involvement in any international affairs had some conflicting thoughts as well.  They felt that the United States shouldn't interfere in countries no matter what's going on, yet, they felt angry after the film ""Hotel Rwanda"" that the U.S. did virtually nothing to stop the needless bloodshed of thousands.  However, can you have it both ways?  Can the U.S. be a country that gets involved in only the ""just"" cases like my friends later felt Rwanda was, if you feel that the U.S. should really be an isolationist country?

If you want the U.S. to step back all its involvement in the world, then you have to be okay with letting tragedies like Rwanda happen.  There are a lot of hard questions contained in those thoughts.  This documentary made me think about many issues like that; it's a great film for people who are thinkers and care about the world and the people in it.

3038856,4,B000Z961UO,"Mitch Anderson's ""The World Without US"" a documentary

This 90 minute presentation takes a hard look at what the world would be like if the United States were to dis-involve its military presence in world affairs and just keep to itself like the majority of peaceful nations around the globe. The answers presented may shock you.

While most ""documentaries"" these days are really nothing more than a filmmaker presenting carefully-chosen data to support their already-chosen positions, I really came away from this feeling as though I had just watched an extremely well-crafted and educational presentation that in fact, does try to stay objective which I found very refreshing and eye-opening.

This is not to say it does not draw some conclusions, and the conclusions it draws do tend to land in the realm of the politically conservative world viewpoint more often than not, which pretty much ensures this is one documentary that will see very little screen time in classrooms, which is an unfortunate shame because it does have a great deal of educational value to offer. Nonetheless, that should not stop the rest of us from gaining the value of what this film has to offer, and it indeed has a lot.

Our director, Mitch Anderson, who also narrates, starts out with his family's history surviving World War II, their plight after the war in a Russian internment camp and praying for the United States to come save them (which unfortunately never happened). As a boy, he dreams of coming to the United States of America and shares his own experience as a young man risking life and limb making multiple attempts at escaping Soviet-controlled Romania before finally making it across Yugoslavia and eventually to Austria where he was granted asylum by the United States Embassy and was able to fulfill his dream of coming to America.

He then sets a global stage and takes the viewer through the modern day social and military scenarios of Europe, the former Soviet bloc, the Middle East and Asia with the help of oratories along the way by experts including former C.I.A. brass, scholars and ambassadors from a variety of countries and cultures. In segments concentrating individually on each area of the world in which the United Stated holds a strong military presence, he sets up where things are today, how they came to be, and what would happen if the United States were to suddenly withdraw its military from their respective regions.

While there is not a whole lot in the way of ""yuck-it-up entertainment value"" contained here (with the notable exception of beautiful Korean girls singing and dancing in an old advertisement to sell communism under Kim Jong Il), and I felt that some parts dragged on a bit more than needed, the quality of the presentation (both technically and substance-wise), educational value and the mere fact that a modern documentary has been created regarding world affairs that isn't a thinly-veiled liberal swipe at my own country's global policies makes this one stand out for me in a very positive way.

(very popular about 2 years ago) trying to answer the same question, what is the purpose of the US meddling in the entire world?

While ""Why we fight"" was a bit of a disappointment, this film really delivered on the promise. After the first twenty minutes you figure that the director is working an angle on the debate, but what I really liked is that he is building a really logical, coherent argument that I could follow from one end to another. And he surely supports it with footage from around the world.

I also liked the fact that it was more than an intellectual exercise. The film had some very touching personal stories that I didn't expect in a ""geo-political"" documentary. It made it one of those films that you still think about the second day after you saw it.

3273320,4,B000Z961UO,"A case for the status quo, or is it? This film makes a good case for its more altruistic motivations , ie I did not know that much about Kuwait charging the US liberators the same price as all else for its oil; or Saddam Hussein's offer of $10 a barrel oil as long as he lived if the US looked the other way while Kuwait and Saudi Arabia felt his tenderness of T-72  invasionary tanks.

I already knew how weak Europe is militarily. In WW1 they could send enough men out in to the battlefield to lose upwards of 800,000 people (Britain 886,939, France 1,397,800, Germany 2,050,897) yet with greater population densities than they had in 1914, Europe combined could only send pathetic squab forces to the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990's.  And these ""peacekeeping"" forces were forbidden from shooting at the belligerents which were massacring civilians even as the peacekeepers looked on.  That is until the US intervened and tidied it all up for them.

I have conflicting feelings about this, Europe might be forced learn something if the US stayed out, spent that defense money on bridges in Minnesota while the Yugoslav conflict ""burned out.""  Millions more would die horribly of course, lost while Europe debates the best course of action about the morality of having men serve in their armed forces and sending them somewhere to get shot at while they attempted to uphold the human rights of an oppressed population which was not their own.  Or just accept what was done as the right decision, the US intervened bombed and sent troops while the other major powers all about wrung their hands in indecision.

With their wealth, the film makes me think about, yes, it would seem Europe should take care of its own defense business as they seem to hate Uncle Sam with a passion, yet anything which requires a tank or a battleship, Europeans are clueless to proceed, crying ""uncle.""  This film was produced in 2008 and with the current worsening economic climate, expecting Europe to spend some money to defend itself ever seems more remote.

The ending of the film, with its suggestion about a possible Chinese reaction to a Japan nuclear arming without the US, does seem a bit over the top.  But then again, hatreds of those two nations run deep, passionately and have been longstanding.  Japan's recent nuclear accident will most certainly place it even further from considering a nuclear deterrent (as if they were ever remotely considering it).

3273323,1,B000Z961UO,"The video examines the question ""what would happen if the US withdrew its forces from all foreign bases?"".  Sadly, the authors  had picked an answer before they examined the question.  Their answer is ""nation would make war upon nation...perish the thought"".  The slick but shallow presentation is a pastiche of images of nasty people and of bad things that have happened (or might happen) plus a collection of sound bites from individuals who are supposed to be offering expert opinion but who, with rare exceptions, are sorely lacking in depth of insight.

The shallowness is a pity because the topic is actually interesting.  The authors posit a US withdrawing from its global bases because a presidential candidate bases his campaign on a promise to do so.  This assumption is illustrative of the central weakness of the video, a lack of both knowledge and imagination.

All imperial nations create within the homeland a military-commercial complex as well as a hyper-nationalist political wing, which together sustain the imperialist cause and are together are virtually unstoppable in ordinary times. This combination, in any state, is more powerful than any one politician, thus great powers only withdraw from empires when compelled to do so by total military defeat or by economic eclipse.

Now, the US is geographically protected from the likelihood of defeat, so the only plausible cause for a global US withdrawal would be an economic one.  Would it be a sudden collapse, or a slow eclipse?  One can only speculate, but the key point is that the cause of of a US retreat would be as consequential as the retreat itself.  If the US cedes its position as the world's biggest importer, biggest borrower, biggest economy and issuer of the main trading currency then there will be changes afoot in world affairs even before the first GI comes home.  A knowledgeable commentator could have given a very engaging talk on the possibilities that arise in such a situation.

Which leads me to the other big weakness, the lack of imagination.  The authors show a world where except for the US withdrawal no other great power radically changes its policy and no major political alliances shift.  Europe,we are assured,is forever pacifist, the same Europe whose driving policy was militant nationalism for centuries up to 1945.  The authors never had the humility to realize that predicting the political future is at best a suggestion of what is possible.  The wrote a prophecy instead.

A professor wishing to illustrate a course in political commentary might find this video useful, in the way same way a professor of pathology would use a diseased organ.  For all others, a waste of time.",1295049600,10,2691,5.004494382022472

3273326,1,B000Z961UO,"""The Ascent of Money,"" which Nial Ferguson spearheaded, positioned the ""free market"" as the answer to all social and economic problems around the world. In this manner, it offered a narrow critique of the world situation. It did however provide a useful historical run-down of the financial world.
Not so much of use in ""The World Without Us."" Ferguson is offered up as the go-to guy here as well. As a British intellectual elite working as a pointman for the maintenance of American world hegemony, he points out European ""hypocrisy"" but never challenges the historical hypocrisy of American foreign policy. He and other ""experts"" interviewed here, focus on the realpolitik consequences of what would happen throughout the world if the U.S. were to remove it's military omnipresence from the world's hot spots or potential hotspots.
They choose to entertain the idea as if it might take place only as an all at once or precipitous withdrawl of troops and assistance, rather than the only way it could take place within the confines of our chugging ""democracy""; as a sensible, progressive removal based on long-term economic, moral and political assesments. In this way, they set the idea up for a fall.
The cover design of the dvd makes it appear as if it were a drama of a sort, with the fictional President's photo in the forefront. But the production of his campaign to convince voters of the importance of drawing back from our Imperial position is, at best, a farce. They must have budgeted about sixty dollars for this section of the documentary. The candidate, we'll assume he is a liberal Democrat (the only type who would propose such an anti-American idea, after all), is seen in high school classroom sized venues surrounded by crowds upward of fifteen supporters. Why so chintzy with the production values? Is it to show that this candidate, who is presented as the mainstream choice for his party for the Presidency, would attract only a few supporters with his cockamamie ideas? But he is a major candidate - not Mike Huckabee! The very premise of the program is that the idea has support (albeit from the gullible populace that the dvd is trying to sway otherwise by talking down to them as if they were infant children).
The candidate is presented as essentially a straw-man to critique. His manner and presentation are an amalgam of the worst of Democratic candidates such as Gore, Clinton and Kerry. He is a smooth talker who appears to lack any authenticity as a person or any personal zeal for the issue on which he has apparently hung his entire candidacy. If this sounds like an indictment of liberal Presidential candidates, it is because that is what it is. But it is also to say that the producers of the dvd either purposely or subconciously made the candidate and his candidacy laughable, and that it is pointedly liberal laughable. In point of fact, a liberal candidate has not and never would campaign on such a preposterous idea of immediate, full-scale withdrawl of military personnel from throughout the world; only a right-wing guy like Ron Paul or Pat Buchanan would try to put something out there like that. So why does the documentary not present this kind of candidate for our perusal? Because then we enter into gray areas of political ideology that induce the viewer to actually do some independant thinking. And this production does not encourage that. It is, instead, pure propaganda that I can use as an example of the technique to my high school students.",1280188800,9,3499,4.852842809364549

This movie tries to portray the U.S.'s military presence and interventions around the world, over the past 20 years, as being ultimately altruistic and moral, rather than self-serving, wrong-headed, and calamitous.  It totally ignores General Smedley Butler's experienced conclusion that ""War is a Racket"", and Eisenhower's warning that the growing influence of the military-industrial complex threatens to ruin American democracy.

And while the film did make several good points about very real threats in the world (racial genocide, radical religious fundamentalists, and an increasingly militarized China), it fails to note the U.S.'s political addiction to keeping several evil boogey-men in power, in order to frighten over-trusting Americans, and justify exorbitant defense expenditures.

3273330,1,B000Z961UO,"This doc is an unnervingly simplified look at recent history, from WW2 and beyond. Watching this, you are left with the impression that without the power of the US military in your backyard, you would be quickly overrun by freedom-hating communists who want to arrest all business owners and lock up your family, or by Muslim extremists who want nothing more than to rule the world, by way of decapitating Jews and infidels. Now, back to reality. About 12 years ago, when I was becoming aware of the world in which we live, I found a book by Richard Pipes (I had NO idea who he was then) called ""Communism: a History"", hoping to learn about the history of communism. What I got was possibly the most blatantly biased book, with little-to-no worldly context included, that I have ever read, and even with my most basic knowledge of things, I knew when I was being told far less than the whole story. At the end of this film, despite what should have been a compelling theme, I was left with a similar feeling. Now, I know you can't include everything in an hour ad a half running time, but to make NO mention of the more than 50 US interventions of sovereign nations around the world, by their own hand or by proxy, since WW2 (which show why a lot of these areas are in such a mess and 'need' US 'help'), is to completely eviscerate any kind of balance that would have made this film credible. To still sprout the myth of the good ""humanitarian"" attacks on the former Yugoslavia during the 90's without even a whisper of US support of one faction against another (the support of Croatia's Tudjman, a nazi admirer and holocaust down-player being just one case in point) which inflamed an already combustible region to the inevitable break-up of the only remaining ""successful""  socialist state in Europe, is in my book being far from candid. And what of US creation of Jihadists in Afghanistan against the Soviets in 1979 (read: origins of al-quaeda and Osama)? What about the overthrow of the democratic Mossadegh, who wanted to spend oil profits on his own people, in Iran in 1953? (leading the the Shah, leading to the Iranian clerics)? What about Vietnam? the bombing of Cambodia that led to Pol Pot? Arming Saddam Hussein and then invading Iraq twice, which, along with a decade of sanctions has killed well over a million Iraqis? No mention of the Kuwaiti  oil market manipulation which led to less Iraqi oil profits to rebuild their country after the terrible decade-long war with Iran (which was of course kept going by US arms shipments to both sides) and slant-drilling practices of Kuwait. We are also fed the most absurd line that the US is not in the middle east for oil, because the US gets most of it's supplies from other regions!! Ever consider that you don't have to physically use the oil to profit from it??? Control is everything. Haiti? El Salvador? Nicuragua? no mention. South America does get a segment in the extras section, and by way of showing what can happen to a country that does not have US support/intervention, we are told by a daughter of Fidel Castro that Cuba HAS hardly any electricity, water, or medical aid. She then mentions that this was when she left there in 1993, probably the lowest period of post-revolutionary Cuba after the death of their trading partners the USSR. NO MENTION of the 50+ year US blockade since the revolution, which, because of US influence, is mostly a blanket blockade (and of course no mention of the rebuilding of Cuba since then). The films' ending especially shows us the filmmakers' blatant message to the world: by giving us a prophetic and very dramatic future scene of a Japanese city after nuclear attack by China, all because the US has packed up and gone home (hey, didn't the US already drop atomic bombs on Japanese cities during the 'good war'?? With friends like these...) we are left in no doubt. The list goes on in regards to what is missing from this film in order to give us a fair assessment of what could happen in the fascinating scenario of the US in fact bringing all it's military home. Yes, the world is a place of dangerous conflicts, but it is a world full of contradictions and subtext, and in no way as simple as the films outcome of 'they will enslave and kill us all without the honorable USA'. The world of international relations is of course a complicated place, but most of what proves that is remarkably absent in this film.  Please forgive the ramble, but this sort of obfuscation of the important facts just makes me kind of mad. And don't get me wrong, I like a lot of the US influence on the world, just not the overthrowing of elected governments, installing/supporting of dictators, bombing, killing children, economic strangulation, etc. Does that really make me anti-American?

This movie is not an ""objective documentary""; but it adds to the discussion.

To be fair, a whole series would have to be made: yes to answer questions about Africa; South-America where American interference has had less positive impacts; about Iraq which was conveniently skimed in the movie (apart for the Gulf War, easier to justify); and even inconditional support for Israel (though the movie dares question and suggest a change of policy on this through the voice of a Kuweiti).

So yes this movie supports the use of American military for global peace and stability by focusing on the good examples where it has been used with some success and conflict prevention in mind. We need part two where we cover the cases when it is not so successful and the part where we really look at what we could do if indeed all this money and human resource was spent on health, environment and education globally - often the root of a lot of conflicts - instead of military equipment.

The director has deliberately ignored the fact that almost half of all Taiwanese do want some form of reunification with China. The newly elected Taiwanese Government is also pro-reunification, and has allowed direct flights between China and Taiwan for the first time in history. PRC citizens are now allowed to travel freely to Taiwan. The reason for all this is that Taiwan has realized it cannot survive economically without PRC. And the US hasn't been much help either. Look at where Hillary Clinton visited on her recent visit to Asia - PRC was the first stop whilst Taiwan was not even on the agenda.  Seems like the US cares more about selling her debts than upholding democratic values. Furthermore, repeatedly addressing Taiwan as a country even though the United Nations does not recognize it as yet is inaccurate too.  I have no opinion regarding the renunification issue, but I think this 'documentary' should at least address both sides of the issue. It also tries to explain the Chinese mindset from a Western stempoint, which is unfair to the non-chinese viewer.

While I was at the G.I. Film Festival in Washington D.C., I had the opportunity to meet Mitch Anderson, creator of the documentary film, ""The World Without Us"".

The film follows the fictional presidential campaign of a candidate named Turner, who vows when elected to bring home the entire U.S. Military from every country it is deployed to. As Turner says in the film, The United States spends countless sums of money that could be better spent at home. Elect him, and the world will think the U.S. is a nice place, and our troops won't get killed. Right?

Wrong. ""The World Without Us"" is a brilliant film that shows why the United States and its military are crucial to world peace today. Mitch Anderson traveled to over 20 countries to speak with people about their thoughts of the U.S. and its missions worldwide. The responses he gets from people are varied but honest. It is interesting to see what other, regular people think about the U.S. worldwide.

Anderson also interviews noted Harvard historian and author Niall Ferguson. I have always enjoyed reading Ferguson, and he hits the nail on the head when he says in the trailer, ""The World is not naturally a peaceful, organized place..... and my great fear is that if the U.S. opts out (of maintaining order) maybe no one will opt in.""

Not only is the film relevant to all Americans curious about their nation's role in the world on the geopolitical level, it is also the story of the hope that is America. Mitch Anderson weaves his own story into the film, and it is the story of countless people that have come to America seeking a better life. Anderson was born in Communist Romania during the Cold War and dreamed of escaping and coming to the United States. Knowing he will be thrown in prison if he is caught trying to leave, he eventually he escapes his homeland and makes it to the United States. As a man that lived under the evil of communism, it is easy to see why he loves the United States, and why he is the best type of American- he knows what the price of freedom is, having lived under its alternative.

""The World Without Us"" is a great documentary showing exactly what the consequences could be if the United States were to shirk its duty in the world. It is natural, probably, for those protesters we have here at home to not like the U.S. Military being sent abroad. They don't like war, and don't like suffering.

3273342,5,B000Z961UO,"Review :
""The World without US"" feature film documentary asks a question that is on the back of our minds and yet we rarely take time to find the answer.  This film presents the answer with an abundance of researched material and a first hand experience to boot.

The producer grew up under the yoke of Communism! When Hitler rose up  and brought the most relentless cruelty and viciousness called the NAZI party along with him, we should have been there to stop him before he crossed the border into Poland. That is what this film brings to light. This film serves out valuable information on a silver platter.

It is information that should be in the conscious mind of all the world's citizens. The American military presence around the world is forcing all the tyrants and tyrannical governments to think twice.

Everywhere our military presence is not located, the tyrants are taking over. This film is a ""wake up call"" like no other. It was not made by a special interest group or a corporate entity or the industrial/military complex.  It was made by someone who truly has a worldview. Made by a man who has lived through tyrants and tyrannical governments. The power of the message hits you almost immediately and takes the viewer on an insightful ride through our immediate history. The scenes are unique, and have rarely been seen by American audiences.

This is a film about a subject that not only happened years ago, it is happening right now.

The music score is powerful and the full message is there for all to learn. This film is for the ""thinking"" American and will keep you thinking way past the end.

A ""must see"" is an understatement.

3273343,1,B000Z961UO,"I was very disappointed, and really rather disgusted with this - I found it to be nothing but an apology for a neo-con World Empire supported by US world aggression - using terror and scenes of terror to support the argument. The premise is that since there will always be war we (our army and their supporting corporations and our taxes) should police all of it. If I watched Fox News, I would expect soon to see this there if it has not already been shown there. There is much mention of our need for oil and how it is ok for our corporations to grab oil for our economy but no mention at all of Peak Oil (when the oil demand outstrips the supply - we are there or soon to be there), the condition that we are preparing for by our aggression, or to the fact that we use our military power to take the resources from the victim country by paying only the elites (who then deposit the cash in the monetary system we control), if we pay anybody, and strip resources without benefiting the local people who do the work. A Pie-in-the-Sky report by a spokesman who says he is a Romanian who was oppressed by the Soviets who is either a starry eyed idealist, a well paid pro-Bush apologist - or just a not very good actor. Simplistic representation equating our costly presence on bases with nuclear deterrence without mention that nuclear deterrence on our enemies in this world would still be possible even if our bases no longer existed. Would our bases be used to launch nuclear weapons or are they there to control local populations when necessary? The film ends with a terror-provoking vision of Taiwan destroyed by a nuclear China due to the closure of our bases in Japan - as if we need bases to protect Japan. And absolutely no mention of the democracies that we have undermined in favor of dictatorships. I'm sorry I have to give this one star in order to write a review - If you support Bush and his neo-cons you will love this - otherwise pass on...",1202428800,14,1956,4.406077348066298

The basic concept being what would happen to the world if the United States decided to bring the troops home. Which in itself is a good question to ask. While it takes a dark look at the world and it could be proved wrong. As history can never be counted upon to do what is predicted. Th evidence presented argues strongly that things could get very messy and bloody very fast.
  What with an impotent Europe that has lost the will to fight. The Tribalism of the Middle East that has a growing population that does like the ways are things done & other resentments. The Asians that is still armed to the teeth and has its own hatreds and resentments towards each other. Altogether its not a pretty picture.

3273345,1,B000Z961UO,"I got an open mind.  I watched the whole thing.  It's basically an ""analysis"" of what the world would be like without the U.S. military being stationed and intervening around the world.

What a neo-con fantasy!  You can tell it's pretty much government propaganda just due to how slick the production is.  They snookered some Romanian dude to narrate the thing to play the ""oh, I suffered under the Russians"" victim act.  That's a tip off right there - the old Cold War mentality.  (If the Russians are no longer a threat to Europe, why are we still there?  Russia withdrew its troops.  When will we?)  The depth of analysis was about as much as a Faux News sound bite.  They would go so far and then not take the next logical step.  Then, they have this ""PhD"" Niall Ferguson from Oxford who continues to paint us as the Second Coming.  Again, no real analysis of events.  They would interview a couple Europeans for the opposing viewpoint and play German oomph-pah bands in the background.  Hilarious!  No mention of the CIA in assassinations, revolutions and general messing up of countries around the world so that we can get good prices on bananas in American supermarkets.  The Palestinian issue gets mentioned and then a bunch of clips showing radical Islamic clerics shouting about ""killing Jews"" (if that's what the translation really was; we know how that works; we've seen it enough).  And then it's dropped.  I bust out laughing during the use of Korean propaganda films to show how dangerous the North Koreans are.  (A propaganda film using someone else's propaganda films and taking them at face value; please, my sides are hurting.)  No mention that the two halves of Korea were having meetings about uniting but the United States kept foiling it.  And then to top it all off, at the end, they played an excerpt from some Asian soap opera where they hinted that China had set off a nuclear bomb over Taiwan and people were dying and if only the U.S. Cavalry had come to the rescue.  (Of course, how human beings are walking around and having conversations after being smacked by a nuke is beyond me.)  So, Niall's analysis of it all is that the American people should just suck it up and keep paying the military bills.  Well, thanks to these traitors, the country will be bankrupt and probably blown up from blowback, and then the world, in the end, will be without us.",1201478400,16,2384,4.645933014354067
3273346,5,B000Z961UO,"This documentary should be required viewing for elementary, high school and college students; indeed for all residents of the US. The perspective, taken from the eyes of a contemporary immigrant to the US, retains admiration and appreciation for the priviliges and responsibilities that are inherent with being ""imperialists of human rights"".  In a time when it is popular to bash America, this is a refreshingly ballsy reminder of how much opportunity we enjoy, and paradoxically, that where much is given to us much is expected from us.
The documentary is thought provoking, an honest scrutiny of the complexities of international relations. One will gain a deeper understanding and a more profound realization of our role in the world--that our position in the world is not merely selfish and self serving but benefits billions of people the world over.

3273348,4,B000Z961UO,"There are a lot of reasons for people to watch this documentary.  First, it has a perspective not often seen in our country, namely, that the U.S. is basically a good place that tries to do good things in the world.  It will definitely be a conversation starter.  I recommend you watch it alone first and then watch it with people who don't hold the same political views as you do.  I made the mistake of watching it with a devout Bush hater the first time and couldn't get all the way through the movie because we got into such a heated argument.  While I'm no Bush apologist I don't think he is like Hitler.
One of the things I like about the film is that it was done by a naturalized citizen who is originally from Romania.  He knows what it's like to live and suffer under a truly oppressive regime and therefore understands that the U.S. is nothing like that despite leftist rhetoric to the contrary.  My favorite part of the film was the coverage of the Balkan War.  I always felt we did too little too late but I had no idea how ineffectual and damaging the European involvement was.  Another highlight is the interview with Castro's daughter and of course the polished dramatizations of the fictional presidential candidate who vows to remove U.S. troops from foreign countries.  This is particularly poignant in the current election year with all the candidate posturing we're forced to witness.  I wonder what this fictional candidate's opponent would say in response to his plan to close military bases worldwide.",1200873600,4,1524,4.649253731343284
3273349,5,B000Z961UO,"For over a century, the United States has been the greatest source on the globe of aid and assistance to troublespots, ranging from war to natural disasters to the proactive provision of defense to both allies and less warm friends.  All the while, too many recipients of this largesse wantonly criticize the United States and bemoan its position as the last superpower, though they rarely decline to continue to accept America's generosity.

This film juxtaposes the simplicity of American populists who call for cessation of our international activities with the potential horrors that could arise if this country chose to withdraw and allow the various powers of evil to run rampant, reminiscent of the 1930s when Germany, Japan, and Italy conquered great swaths of the map.  this documentary also brings Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged to mind as the stability of the world is shown to be so precarious without America's forthright wilingness to intervene in locales that the average citizen could not find on the map, ranging from the military action in the genocide perpetrated in the aftermath of Yugoslavia's dissolution to the bulwark the US provides in defending North Korea from destroying South Korea.

While the message is essentially simple,it is a story that must be told as both Americans and citizens of countries around the world should be aware that a world without the United States would be a cycle of chaos and totalitarian regimes, as unchecked evil would have no compunction to repeat the dark deeds that history is replete with.  Edmund Burke famously observed that ""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.""  America has filled that vacuum.

3273352,5,B000Z961UO,"I was interested in watching this documentary, but it was even more thought-provoking than I expected.  It starts off with a fictional ""Turner for President"" ad in which a candidate Turner promises to withdraw most of our troops from the world and focus solely on domestic issues.  This seems simple at first, but then the film dives into why this is such a complicated topic -- what if the US really DID do that?  What would the affect on the world really be?

The producer and narrator, Mitch Anderson, goes on a journey around the world seeking answers, but first telling his own story of coming to America after escaping Soviet oppression.  He had grown up hearing about ""Mr. Truman and Mr. Eisenhower,"" and how his family hoped they would return to free Eastern Europe from Soviet oppression -- but they never did.  Mitch takes his journey, thoughts, and themes seriously and yet with care and conviction.  There is input from everyone from former US Ambassadors to Bosnian citizens to a North Korean escapee, and many more.  The cheif anchor of the documentary is Niall Ferguson, PhD (professor of history at Oxford University is just one of his credits), who adds thoughtful and well-spoken thoughts.

The documentary asks many tough questions, and it receives answers from people of many varying cultural backgrounds.  The conclusions it draws are not always complete (because there are not always easy answers), but they usually make sense, even when they are surprising.  I was reminded of some of the conflicting thoughts myself and some friends had after watching the excellent film ""Hotel Rwanda.""  Some of my friends who are opposed to U.S. involvement in any international affairs had some conflicting thoughts as well.  They felt that the United States shouldn't interfere in countries no matter what's going on, yet, they felt angry after the film ""Hotel Rwanda"" that the U.S. did virtually nothing to stop the needless bloodshed of thousands.  However, can you have it both ways?  Can the U.S. be a country that gets involved in only the ""just"" cases like my friends later felt Rwanda was, if you feel that the U.S. should really be an isolationist country?

If you want the U.S. to step back all its involvement in the world, then you have to be okay with letting tragedies like Rwanda happen.  There are a lot of hard questions contained in those thoughts.  This documentary made me think about many issues like that; it's a great film for people who are thinkers and care about the world and the people in it.

Please check this out as this is a great documentary and not the kind you're going to get to see on CNN.",1198195200,62,2636,4.77924944812362
3273353,4,B000Z961UO,"Mitch Anderson's ""The World Without US"" a documentary

This 90 minute presentation takes a hard look at what the world would be like if the United States were to dis-involve its military presence in world affairs and just keep to itself like the majority of peaceful nations around the globe. The answers presented may shock you.

While most ""documentaries"" these days are really nothing more than a filmmaker presenting carefully-chosen data to support their already-chosen positions, I really came away from this feeling as though I had just watched an extremely well-crafted and educational presentation that in fact, does try to stay objective which I found very refreshing and eye-opening.

This is not to say it does not draw some conclusions, and the conclusions it draws do tend to land in the realm of the politically conservative world viewpoint more often than not, which pretty much ensures this is one documentary that will see very little screen time in classrooms, which is an unfortunate shame because it does have a great deal of educational value to offer. Nonetheless, that should not stop the rest of us from gaining the value of what this film has to offer, and it indeed has a lot.

Our director, Mitch Anderson, who also narrates, starts out with his family's history surviving World War II, their plight after the war in a Russian internment camp and praying for the United States to come save them (which unfortunately never happened). As a boy, he dreams of coming to the United States of America and shares his own experience as a young man risking life and limb making multiple attempts at escaping Soviet-controlled Romania before finally making it across Yugoslavia and eventually to Austria where he was granted asylum by the United States Embassy and was able to fulfill his dream of coming to America.

He then sets a global stage and takes the viewer through the modern day social and military scenarios of Europe, the former Soviet bloc, the Middle East and Asia with the help of oratories along the way by experts including former C.I.A. brass, scholars and ambassadors from a variety of countries and cultures. In segments concentrating individually on each area of the world in which the United Stated holds a strong military presence, he sets up where things are today, how they came to be, and what would happen if the United States were to suddenly withdraw its military from their respective regions.

While there is not a whole lot in the way of ""yuck-it-up entertainment value"" contained here (with the notable exception of beautiful Korean girls singing and dancing in an old advertisement to sell communism under Kim Jong Il), and I felt that some parts dragged on a bit more than needed, the quality of the presentation (both technically and substance-wise), educational value and the mere fact that a modern documentary has been created regarding world affairs that isn't a thinly-veiled liberal swipe at my own country's global policies makes this one stand out for me in a very positive way.

The trailer I saw really got my interest, the premise seemed to be so interesting and so timely for our nation. It reminded me a lot of another film, called ""Why we fight?"" (very popular about 2 years ago) trying to answer the same question, what is the purpose of the US meddling in the entire world?

While ""Why we fight"" was a bit of a disappointment, this film really delivered on the promise. After the first twenty minutes you figure that the director is working an angle on the debate, but what I really liked is that he is building a really logical, coherent argument that I could follow from one end to another. And he surely supports it with footage from around the world.

I also liked the fact that it was more than an intellectual exercise. The film had some very touching personal stories that I didn't expect in a ""geo-political"" documentary. It made it one of those films that you still think about the second day after you saw it.

It nearly calls out the Muslims as being troublemakers wherever they go, bringing violent ethnic strife with them as we are introduced to the mutual slaughters of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s that segues into the Middle East and that's when I became very suspicious.

Although we've been complained about for interfering in the Middle East because we need to control oil, it turns out we don't benefit from advantageous contracts despite covering the region - our existence there keeps many of the would-be troublemakers in CHECK because there's just something about Brand America that gives the bad guys pause and there are a lot of bad guys in the Middle East  - they tend to bully each other e.g. Lebanon and Kuwait and not just the Jews.

The vitriol against the Jews from their own mouths  - not pretty and very disturbing because really, who would be next on their list based on their value system?

So what are we doing there other than to keep the peace - given the loss of the mandate to self govern when they are so hateful, it can only be some kind of sabotage.  It looks like Japan and Europe would be very damaged if there is no peace in the region - this can be triggered - and it would become useful if ... the Axis tag team ever decloaked/did an about face.

America at great expense and with great patience and diligence created an advantage against future/old enemies.
