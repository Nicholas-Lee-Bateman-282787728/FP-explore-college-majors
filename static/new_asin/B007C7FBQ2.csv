5076856,4,B007C7FBQ2,"The principal attraction of this recording of Verdi's La Forza del Destino is that it's a performance of the rarely heard original St Petersburg version, written by the composer for the Imperial Opera in 1862. It was subsequently revised in 1867 for Milan and it's the later version that has become the more commonly performed or at least better known principally for the famous extended overture that Verdi added. In reality, although there is clearly an attempt by the composer to bring a better musical and dramatic integrity to the piece, the differences between the two versions aren't all that significant, but in addition to having a rare opportunity to compare them, there is the pleasure alone of seeing a fine performance of the earlier version actually being performed in St Petersburg in 1998 at the Mariinsky Theatre under Valery Gergiev.

Despite the revisions made to the Italian version, the essential dramatic arc and the fate of the characters however remain largely unchanged. The coincidences that tie these figures are still not entirely convincing, but they are made compelling - in both versions - by the strength in Verdi's musical writing that aligns character so beautifully not just to Wagnerian motifs, but to melodies that are expressive of their condition. It might have a mid-eighteenth century setting, but it's clear that Verdi doesn't have to look too far beyond his own time to relate in some meaningful way with these figures who in better times might have been friends and lovers, but whose lives have been torn apart by greater forces beyond their control - the tides of war, fate and the demands of honour.

Directed for the stage by Elijah Moshinsky, this 1998 recording at the Mariinsky Theatre is a very traditional period staging, but the theatricality of the painted backdrops that set the scene for the Seville locations, army camps and monasteries suits the punchier, set-pieces of the earlier version of the work, the dark lighting of the stage working also with the dark tones in Verdi's score. That's brought out wonderfully by Valery Gergiev in this production, finding nonetheless a romantic sweep and sensitivity within the score that works hand-in-hand with the heavier dramatic colouring. I'm not familiar with any of the Russian singers here but they are well cast and handle the Italian phrasing well. Galina Gorchakova is a fine Leonora, carrying the nature and interior conflict of her character well, her singing strong and consistent. Gegam Grigorian is a lovely lyrical Don Alvaro, but doesn't always seem to be dramatically involved. His 'Della natal sua terra' aria at the start of Act III is beautifully sung, but he's not as strong in 'Quel sangue sparsi' by the end of the act. Nikolai Putilin is a solid, earnest Don Carlo, but I didn't find Marianna Tarasova made such a strong impact as Preziosilla.

Directed for the screen by Brian Large, the production comes across well giving a good impression of the whole stage while capturing all the little details in the drama without any excessive editing trickery or close-ups, although there is one awkward edit at the end of Act III. A 1998 recording, it is not filmed in High Definition, so there's no Blu-ray release, but the quality of the 16:9 widescreen image for DVD is excellent nonetheless, as is the quality of the PCM 2.0 stereo audio track. Other than notes on the opera and the production in the enclosed booklet, there are no extra features on the disc itself, the 2 hours 45 minutes of the opera on a dual-layer disc in NTSC format. The disc is compatible for all regions. Subtitles are in English, German, French, Dutch and Spanish only - there is no Italian for anyone wanting to read the original libretto.",1346371200,4,3739,4.922345483359747

I bought Don Carlo a while ago for the same two principal singers: Jonas Kaufman and Anja Harteros and they were outstanding in their roles. I wasn't surprised when I saw them with the same kind of performance in this production, Ludovic Tezier playing Leonoras brother was also very good., duets between him and Alvaro as well as the arias sung by these performers were very good.
The opera was outdated to a modern time; I didn't find any problem with that, the story line was unchanged. The costumes were also corresponding with this time.
I highly recommend this DVD for Verdis opera lovers",1466899200,,693,4.552

5076864,1,B007C7FBQ2,"The one star is for Jonas Kaufmann. The other negatives are for Martin Kusej who is another one of the modern directors who introduces so many new plot twists, modern themes, and his own personal take on the forces of destiny that the singing gets lost in the dark staging.  There are many other more traditional versions of this opera truer to what I think Verdi intended which also highlights the singing.",1464220800,10,407,4.652777777777778
5076865,5,B007C7FBQ2,"While I gave this the same 5 star rating as the other reviewer, I couldn't disagree more regarding the production.  To keep it simple, I just found it ugly and lacked a clear relationship to the story line.  Others may disagree but this is one time that intellectualizing by a director was just a no go.  I am not opposed to controversial productions and different points of view.  I want to be challenged when I see and hear a production.  But for me this was a waste of the company's money.  Another small negative, was the English titles.  While overall Sony did a good job, sometimes there were none for short periods of time and it was not repetitive text.

On the plus side, this is singing at its most glorious.  It just blew me away.  For those of you that attend a fair amount of ""live"" performances, this is the kind what we wait and hope for every time we enter the theatre, but so seldom get.  Given that, it still gets 5 gold stars from me.",1461024000,18,953,4.297752808988764
5076866,5,B007C7FBQ2,"This performance of 2014 can be considered as a reference on account of the quality of the vocal material involved and because the daring staging of Austrian Martin Kuej is rich in meaning within the context of the global challenges of today. He proposes a reflection on war, on vengeance and also on the mark of guilt which ends with the joie de vivre and the expansion of passions. In the intimacy of Calatrava, his is a post-Bauhaus picture of a Fascist neatness which then contrasts with the chaos of battles, the abyss of misery and the sexual stampede after triumph or failure. In this context, religion, instead of being a consolation is both an escape and the tomb of humanity; the chapel wherein Leonora hides is made out of huge crosses and in one of them, just for a moment, Don lvaro seems crucified by his fate.

The move of the action to the 20th century (and up to our days) seeks to comment on current aspects of war, with erotic splinters of a sadomasochistic nature when describing the behavior inside military camps and racism as the protagonist of the opera, Don lvaro, is presumably an Inca mestizo with noble blood. But the bottom line is that Kuej calls into question that the central theme of the opera is fate and he suggests that the tragedy social and familiar is due to the manipulative power of religious institutions. Neither Christianity nor Islam are spared.

The staging adds one discovery after another, particularly with the plummeting views of the guerilla hideouts (one has the impression of looking from the top of a hole into an underground cave), the ascension into heaven of Leonora in the mind of Don lvaro and the multipurpose table that serves to make love, to fight, as a refuge for pilgrims and also to die.

It is hard to imagine nowadays a better Leonora clearly more lyrical than spinto than that of Anja Harteros, who evokes Callas in her scenic abandonment and who raises her transparent singing and astonishing naturalness in such a demanding opera for sopranos. The Don lvaro of Jonas Kaufmann is simply huge, with a brilliant voice, skillful in handling nuances and halftones, capable of irrigating with emotion each word and with a scenic talent that allows him to go through savage violence, tenderness, contained anger and the pursuit of mystical ecstasy. His version of La vita  inferno is memorable, as also the duets with Leonora in the First Act (of high voltage) and with Don Carlo di Vargas, in another admirable performance of baritone Ludovic Tzier, whose song line and artistic maturity place him in the best tradition of great Verdian baritones. From his most lyrical material, Tzier attacks the dreaded Urna fatale with the certainty of a Leonard Warren. His encounters with Kaufmann are of an enervating and explosive vocal and scenic tension.

Asher Fisch conducts expertly, although at times with a too overwhelming sound. The version chosen is that of Milan 1869, with the adaptation of Franz Werfel, who places the grand scene with Preziosilla midway through the third act, as in the 1862 St. Petersburg version. This order was premiered in Dresden in 1926, under the conduction of Fritz Busch, and that same year in Munich with Karl Bhm on the podium.",1457654400,20,3225,4.824593128390597
8514287,4,B007C7FBQ2,"By way of full disclosure, Kaufmann and Tezier are two of my current favorites.  Forza is a wonderful tour de force for a good collaboration between tenor and baritone.  In that regard this does not disappoint.

Having grown up on traditional productions from the 1960's, I find this staging odd and it takes getting used to.  That said, Harteros as Leonora is very effective.  Her voice in this performance hall sounds smaller that her predecessors in bygone eras, but she colors her phrases beautifully and has enough power when needed.  ""La Vergine degli angeli,""  perhaps the most beautiful music Verdi wrote for soprano, was handled very well as she soars above the muted chorus with luscious soft but bright tones.  Again the staging is odd with the chorus looking right at her and supposedly not knowing she is female makes the drama of the story out of place.  Her ""Pace, pace,"" is equally effective.

Kaufman and Tezier are well matched in their duets.  Each as a big moment aria which are well balanced and presented with appropriate drama.  My one reservation is in the final duet in Act IV, ""Invano Alvaro.""  Kaufman over-sings the high B-flats at the climax of the 15 duet causing him to lose focus and projection.  His voice, though powerful, is not a full robusto tenore, but it is a full spinto tenore.

Bass-baritone  Vitali KowaJow is an effective Padre Guardiano.

Conductor Asher Fisch generally had a good reading of the score and uses some appropriate give and take for the singers when dealing with staging issues.  Occasionally, he gets bogged down, but it seams related to the blocking and the sets.  If you can get used to the unusual non-specified ""some time in the 2oth century"" setting, this is an overall good production.",1507680000,2,1751,4.815436241610739

1. REVIEW OF GERGIEV VERSION.
INTENDED TITLE OF REVIEW: 'Sound out of sync with video, and not even consistent'
INTENDED RATING: Two stars.
===
This review refers to the original 1862 St. Petersburg version of Forza, conducted by Valery Gergiev.  It was a great production from the Mariinsky Theater, with excellent singers and traditional costumes, sets, everything as close to 1862 as reasonably possible.  And it is of the original version which is rarely heard, and has several differences immediately apparent from the better known later version.

The 1862 version has some noticeable differences from the far-better-known standard version of 1867. (Spoiler alert!  Skip this paragraph if you don't want spoilers :)  First of all the overture is much shorter and has some different figurations of accompaniment, easily noticeable.  Some of the choruses are also a little different, in fact they are more DIFFICULT in this than the later version.  Apparently Verdi simplified them.  Also there is a scene added, or rather, moved. It is after the Rataplan chorus, so it is either the new end of Act III, or the new beginning of Act IV.  Don Carlo meets Don Alvaro in the hotel lobby and challenges him to a duel, and they fight there, not out by Leonora's cave.  And, most surprisingly, Alvaro jumps off a cliff and kills himself at the end rather than kneeling and being forgiven by the angel.  Frankly I think the original ending far better matches the tone of the rest of this major dime-store piece of pulp fiction.  But apparently, Verdi heard too many complaints from weak souls who wanted a happier ending :)

End of spoilers!

In any case it was a production that 'shoulda' been captured competently on video, but alas, it wasn't.  And I know it is fixable, because even a poor, dumb guy like me has ALMOST enough audio equipment and gadgets to completely fix it in my own den.  But the video companies and remasterers are either too lazy or too ignorant to bother (and I tried to word that as charitably as possible).

Here is the problem. The sound is badly out of synch with the video.  MANY classical DVDs have this problem, but at least most of them are at least consistent.  So if you have an audio delay box, which I finally went and invested $240 and bought one, and you determine a video is, say, 30 milliseconds out of synch, you just set the box for 30 and then it plays correctly from beginning to end.

This one, however, is a different story.  It drifts around the board, so you have to sit there and correct it periodically by remote.

So here are my rough notes from the first pass, which will have to be fine tuned on several viewings.  Tracks 1-30, zero or negligible delay (I guess I should be thankful).  Tracks 31-47, about 40 millisecond delay.  Track 48, increases to about 50 milliseconds.  Track 49 to end, return to 40 millisecond.

40 milliseconds refers to 40/1000 or 4/100 of a second, which doesn't sound like much, but consider one second is a huge amount of time in this context.  It has led other reviewers to conclude the singers are lip-synching to a pre-recorded soundtrack.  But if you can line up the video and audio with a delay box, you will see this is definitely not the case.

Now lest you think this a fault of my system ... I have many dozens of DVD that play correctly, without correction;  and the fault here is guaranteed recreatable every time;  and other reviewers have mentioned the problem, although sometimes not knowing exactly what it is.

Shame on Kultur for releasing it this way, and double-shame on Arthaus for re-releasing it with a fancier cover design, without fixing the content which was being complained about many years ago!

2. REVIEW OF KAUFMANN VERSION.
INTENDED TITLE OF REVIEW: 'Cheap for a reason, sorry I wasted money on it'
INTENDED RATING: One star.
===

I really like Jonas Kaufmann.  In fact, I consider him the only modern-day tenor who could compete during the Golden Era of the 1940's up thru maybe the 1960's.

But Kaufmann or no Kaufmann, this production can't be redeemed.  I gave it more than a fair shot.  The setting is updated to perhaps the 1960's.  I don't mind an updating, if it makes some sense (at least a little).  This doesn't make any whatsoever.  The 1960's was not the era of honor killings, in Western Europe anyway.  Nor was it the era of soldiers of making pious prayers in public, or wishing well to passing pilgrims, or girls rushing off to a monastery.  It doesn't make sense that Leonora's brother ages 10 or 15 years between Acts 1 and 2.  And it doesn't make sense that Leonora's father, who is killed on-stage (very good stage-craft on that, I admit) is obviously the same person as Father Guardino.  I can see some doubling of comprimario roles in el-cheapo productions, but this is not that.  I don't believe the Bavarian State Opera was short on money that particular evening and had to make do.  No, It must be a new plot point, and do you know what?  I HAVE NO INTEREST IN KNOWING.  I wanted an opera by Verdi, and this ain't it!

It is well-known that Verdi was unhappy with people tampering with his operas and changing the setting, etc.  Look at the history of Ballo in Maschera if you need a concrete example.  Was he happy with moving it back and forth between Boston and Sweden?  Did he say, ""Of course, whatever you want""?  No, he was very unhappy with it.  And I think we ought to respect his intentions in story line as well as in his harmony and orchestrations etc.

So I made it up to the entry into the suburban, mahogany-lined monastery, then I decided I had better things to do with my evening.  It is insulting they would (A) create this crap and then (B) sell this crap.  I suppose I could donate it to the library, but that would tend to continue hurting opera in the future.  I would rather throw it in the garbage where it belongs, and preferably have my money back.  Suing them for fraud would also be a nice extra touch.
