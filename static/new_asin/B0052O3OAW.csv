4530191,5,B0052O3OAW,Jodie and Tyler have done what the rest of us Christmas Story fans only dream about....walking in the footsteps of characters we have loved forever...  Wonderful companion piece for one of the all time beloved movies... Would like to see TBS run it along side of the movie on Christmas eve....,1387843200,2,293,4.745098039215686
4530192,3,B0052O3OAW,Congrats on getting this on Amazon. Its cute and dorky and for die hard Christmas Story fans. I wished it had film clips in it as well.,1387411200,,135,4.037037037037037
4530193,3,B0052O3OAW,"It's not that well done, looks a bit like amateur hour. One thing that would have made it tremendously better would have been to include clips from the movie for the references they made to the movie, instead of simply text on the screen to read and telling you to ""watch for this"" in the movie.",1387411200,3,295,4.285714285714286
4530194,5,B0052O3OAW,It is a fan film ... not a professional documentary ... but we loved it!  Love their spirit! Learned lots about how and where the movie was made.,1386460800,,145,4.178571428571429
4530195,4,B0052O3OAW,"Yes it is like a home movie about the sets and locations where the movie ""A Christmas Story"" was filmed.  The movie makers do take you to these places.  But the movie is much more than a quest for historical trivia!  The movie documents how much the couple loves ""A Christmas Story. """,1385942400,8,284,4.320754716981132
4530196,2,B0052O3OAW,"This is a review of the product, not the seller.  I am a huge fan of this movie and have had the opportnity to vist the house in Cleveland, etc.  I watch it several times when it is run 24 hours on TV and of course I watch it once or twice from my blu Ray as well...so when I saw this DVD for sale, I thought heck yeah....one of the things I wanted to see was the rescuing of the black board...as they describe it on the DVD box...I put it in the machine...and it's not in the ""movie""...they show shots coming from the school, and show people tearing the place apart, etc...but not the chalk board.  I guess in the end, the DVD was Ok....and I knew it wasn't professionally made, so that wasn't a disappointment, it just seemed as though they were in a huge hurry to get it done and didn't put enough time into making it the way it should be made...20 bucks isn't a huge amount of money, but 10 would be a better price.",1315353600,6,919,4.066298342541437
4530197,4,B0052O3OAW,"While they don't actually use any actual clips from the movie, I enjoyed their little sojourn into the world of all things ""Christmas Story"". Being someone who loves to take small jaunts to visit the sites of the small towns surrounding me, I liked watching as they went into each town and scouted out the places that, in many cases, were lost to history. Failing to grasp the impact ""Christmas Story"" would have on the American scene locations and props were torn down, farmed out, destroyed over time. And to get to see how much they were able to unearth was fascinating. A nice companion piece to the original movie.",1487980800,,619,4.636363636363637
4530198,4,B0052O3OAW,I really enjoyed this show. It was interesting to see where they shot the movie,1485734400,,79,4.333333333333333

A Christmas Story fan from Cleveland.",1484179200,,75,5.333333333333333
4530203,3,B0052O3OAW,"Okay, so it's not a glossy documentary, but it's clearly a loving homage to a perennial Christmas favorite we all know and love!  I thoroughly enjoyed 'riding along' as the filmmakers find all the locations used in the movie and interview as many people they could find associated with the film, but I would have enjoyed it SO much more if they'd included THEN and NOW pictures to go along with all the locations and sites they found.  More often than not they simply talk about this scene or that scene from the movie and you're expected to remember what it looked like in the film yourself.  It's a minor detail, but otherwise a very pleasant journey.",1484006400,,653,4.564102564102564
4530204,1,B0052O3OAW,Terrible.... wpuld give it zero stars if it was an option.,1484006400,,58,4.363636363636363
4530205,5,B0052O3OAW,"They are not professional film makers, but I think it was great! It was just like going on a road trip with friends! Anyone who is a fan of the movie will enjoy the fun of this film.",1483920000,,182,3.8157894736842106
4530206,5,B0052O3OAW,"Fan made documentary on the real locations used for the classic film ""A Christmas Story"".  Now some fan films might not have a nig budget to work with however because they are made with love there is almost always a positive results.  This is no exception.  What was nice about this film was the fact they track down many things that were used in the film.  A studio made documentary would just focus on interviewing actors.  So in this we get to see  many things we never ever would as an extra on dvd.

Please watch this film.  You will love it!",1483747200,,547,4.294117647058823

4530208,1,B0052O3OAW,"Nice idea, but completely amateurish with no (much-needed) movie clips of locations used to enhance their road trip.  I'm guessing they didn't get permission to use clips, which just makes this a personal-interest romp rather than a documentary.",1483488000,,245,5.447368421052632

Jeff lived but he went to Texas to work, but he was hit by a truck non insured 16 year old. But we loved that show!",1483315200,,244,3.7115384615384617

4530218,2,B0052O3OAW,Low budget home movie documentary trying to track down locations and props related to A Christmas Story. Would have helped tremendously to have clips of the actual movie throughout showing the actual scenes of the movie the couple was talking about......,1483142400,,254,5.219512195121951
4530219,5,B0052O3OAW,"It was great to see the old locations and props from the classic movie.  Plus, the hosts were big fans, too, and you could definitely tell it!  Excellent watch for any fan of the original movie!",1483056000,,194,4.361111111111111
4530220,5,B0052O3OAW,great item presented  especially after watching the marathon  Just a great show of love presented  A Christmas Story will ALWAYS be watched with this documentary in mind Thank you for your love of this CLASSIC !!,1483056000,,212,4.833333333333333
4530221,4,B0052O3OAW,"Very interesting but they didn't tell about how the guy who bought the house on ""Cleveland street"" had to completely renovate the inside to look like the sets they built to shoot the scenes, because the original inside of that house looked nothing at all like the sets they built. But if you love a Christmas Story you should like this and find it interesting.",1482969600,,360,4.553846153846154

4530226,3,B0052O3OAW,It was fine.  I learned a few things about the movie that I didn't know.  It was a watch one time kind of show for me.,1482710400,,118,3.5

4530235,3,B0052O3OAW,"Enjoyable to an extent, but can get a little dull and could have been done without them acting out scenes or providing some of the hokey presentation. If you're a fan of the movie (you probably are if you're reading this), it's worth watching for some of the stories and trivia you'll hear. Not a must-see, but a useful time killer.",1481414400,,332,4.459016393442623

4530240,5,B0052O3OAW,We loved this documentary about A Christmas Story! This is one of our all time favorite holiday movies and so we really appreciated hearing about their road trip! You could tell they really had a great time putting this together and having success finding the places where the movie was filmed. Now I want to go to the museum in Cleveland!,1480809600,,339,4.573770491803279

4530246,2,B0052O3OAW,It was eh,1472256000,,9,2.3333333333333335
4530247,4,B0052O3OAW,"I only wish that when they pointed out some of the anachronisms of the movie and talked about the scenes, that they would have actually shown that scene from the movie.  However, maybe they had to deal with copyright issues, and that would have been tough.  I adore this movie immensely, and have watched it, well, I can't even count how many times I have watched it.  It is an absolute tie with ""It's a Wonderful Life"", which thankfully, they are very different movies, which is why they tie!  Where is Peter Billingsly now, and why didn't he show up to the grand opening of the Christmas Story House?  I remember when Billingsly was a co-host of ""Real People"" with Sarah Purcell and a few others.  I think that was the name of the show.  Schwartz, I believe, became a porn star!  I loved Darren McGavin when he was on ""The Night Stalker"".  This movie will always hold a special place in my heart, so it's really sweet to find a young couple that love it this much to track down so much from the movie.  Who cares if it's low budget!  It's got love and lots of heart!",1470960000,3,1068,4.316582914572864
4530248,5,B0052O3OAW,"This is clearly an amateur film. But, saying that, it is the best amateur documentary I have ever seen.  These two have a talent for film making. I only got through half of it so far. In some ways the best ""making of"" type of documentary I have ever seen.  You never get to hear from the guy who was in charge of the antique autos.  If you are a big fan of the film, I highly recommend this film.",1468886400,3,396,3.925
4530249,2,B0052O3OAW,"Really? The editing, bad. The jokes, bad. The randomness, bad. and the highlight is the Chop Suey search and it stinks. While you'll get sucked in and watch the whole thing (BEWARE!) you'll be shaking your head and asking yourself ""why?!?"" Is it really that amazing that you're standing on the sidewalk of the location of the tree farm that's now a bar/restaurant?",1468886400,2,364,4.7936507936507935
4530250,3,B0052O3OAW,"It's fun if you are a big fan of the movie.  Low quality, looks like it was just a home video.",1467244800,,94,3.4761904761904763

4530253,4,B0052O3OAW,"not a bad bio on the movie, in fact, if you don't love a Christmas story, don't bother.  Its cute and loved seeing behind the scenes.  The Christmas bells going off when they had facts on screen got a bit old, but outside of that, really well done.  agree with another commentator, wished they wouldn't of had the ask questions to those on street.  took away from it for me.  anyhow, grab a cup of hot cocoa, put on your favorite Christmas sweater..and get ready to enjoy the backstory to ""A Christmas Story""",1461715200,2,508,4.419354838709677
4530254,5,B0052O3OAW,Loved it!,1461024000,,9,4.0
4530255,2,B0052O3OAW,"I appreciate what they were trying to do but it was just too rough for me to like. And the fact they didn't have the licensing to use actual footage so it was told mostly in supers made it a tough and less interesting watch. (Although again, I realize this was a more independent venture done with well-meaning)",1459209600,,311,4.379310344827586
4530256,4,B0052O3OAW,Very interesting facts about the movie if you are a fan.,1455667200,,56,4.181818181818182

4530258,4,B0052O3OAW,Entertaining. Worth the watch.,1454371200,,30,6.75
4530259,5,B0052O3OAW,"Pleased to see that the haters are much in the minority here. This is a great movie. It's totally an amateur production, and looks it... which is why it's awesome.

I've got my technical gripes about it, but they're not relevant because... (see above paragraph). It's a shame the makers couldn't afford the rights to the scenes they talk about, since that would have landed their points harder, but you can take note of those points and then look out for that stuff next time you watch A Christmas Story.

Mostly, Road Trip for Ralphie is a pleasure because the two hosts are superfans and not afraid to be total dorks on camera. It's also an extremely Canadian effort, in every sense. (Yes, that's a selling point.)

In sum, this is a movie that separates the real ACS-heads from the posers. If you love the scope and tone of its subject, you'll love this affectionate tribute.",1453939200,,878,4.615384615384615
4530260,4,B0052O3OAW,A great film that offers everything it's viewers could ask for. All around excellent! I would highly recommend this to anyone.,1452211200,,126,5.0476190476190474

4530263,3,B0052O3OAW,"The couple seem nice and it's an interesting topic but it's odd there are no clips from the movie. I thought clips were pretty much free to use. Some single frame comparisons with the current location might have been nice to see, too. Nice to hear from the folks that worked on the movie and the costume house that not only had a lot of costumes but also all kinds of polaroids and notes.",1449964800,,388,4.256756756756757

But this fan homage to the places that were used in the movie is only for the very very addicted.  Its an amateur production (boy is it ever) and it kinda stretched my patience to the breaking point after a reenactment of the frozen tongue scene on a makeshift flagpole in front of the actual school used in the movie (which was being dismantled at the time).  That's when I turned it off.  Be warned, only for the very very very much in love with the movie fans.",1445904000,,577,4.218181818181818

4530298,2,B0052O3OAW,"I'm not a major A Christmas Story fan, although I've always liked the movie; I AM a fan, though, of movie memorabilia and trivia. I always love seeing movie sets, props, locations, etc. So I thought I would enjoy this documentary.

Wrong.

This film is an hour and a half long. That's ninety minutes of your life you're not getting back, folks. It's painful for much of it; there is  enough in this film to fill about forty minutes worth of a documentary. Maybe fifty. Certainly not ninety. The couple who take the road trip do some stuff to fill in the ninety minutes, like re-enact scenes from the film, but not in any charming or endearing way. Mostly I rolled my eyes and hoped it would get better. No such luck. There is also a heavy reliance on text, which has an annoying Christmas midi-like tune jingling while you read it. It's grating, to say the least. Finally, and probably most annoying of all, these road-tripping documentarians didn't secure the rights to the film's clips; that would have been helpful (and would have leant integrity to these ninety minutes).

I did enjoy seeing the film locations and sets, and the props; I especially liked the scene where the couple visited the costume warehouse (of course they zip through this at the speed of light - seriously, they speed up one of the more interesting parts of the movie). I think they could have done a much better job when they visited the school and 'rescued' the chalkboard. I mean, that's a main selling feature for this doc, and they pretty much show you a demolished school room. I don't even recall seeing the actual saving of the chalkboard, just hearing that they did save it.

The last thirty minutes are the most interesting part of this film, but, really, unless you're a die hard fan (I mean DIE HARD), this doc is tedious and dull, and simply not worth your time.",1419897600,,1852,4.566265060240964
4530299,5,B0052O3OAW,"Being a fan of the Christmas Story, I was surprised so much of it was filmed in Canada....always thought it was filmed in Cleveland. I thought the couple did a terrific  job in tracking down where the various scenes were filmed.",1419897600,,228,4.560975609756097
4530300,4,B0052O3OAW,"This was a fun and nostalgic remembrance of a true classic Christmas movie.  The production certainly is not ""Hollywood quality"" and seemed like it could have been a senior project for a kid in college.  However, it was made by fans of the movie for fans of the movie.  It would have benefited by showing some of the clips from the movie that the presenters discussed.  I'm sure some sort of copyrighting prohibited this from happening.  There are several facts that were pointed out that I never realized such as the ground is covered with sand instead of snow in the scene where Ralphie drops the F-bomb.

If you bought the DVD or watched it on Prime expecting a big budget documentary, you should be more realistic.  If you said I stopped watching after 5 minutes, I can only assume you're not a fan of A Christmas Story.  Sure, I wish they filmed it in HD, had professional looking graphics and could show clips from the actual movie but if you know the movie well enough you know what they are describing.  I think the couple did a good job of presenting.  The only interviews I found to be a waste of time were of the people on the street at the site where the family bought the Christmas tree.  Like most scenes in the movie, that was a good one, but far from the most memorable imo.  This along with the Bob Clark/Peter Billingsley commentary on the Blu-ray disc give you some great background and facts about a great movie.  I can't think of any other movie that I'd be willing to watch several times in a row and still be entertained.  If you've seen A Christmas Story often, you might still be picking up things you never noticed before every time you watch it and this documentary will give you some info you won't find watching the movie or the Clark/Billingsley commentary.",1419552000,5,1259,4.415584415584416

Some serendipitous moments such as finding the school in its last days before renovation were good finds. Essentially it's an amateur movie with a good heart and a simple idea. The inability to show then and now comparisons (I assume to rights issues) makes it harder to see what was is left from 1983.

4530336,3,B0052O3OAW,"As a devotee of all things Jean Shepherd, having been first introduced to his books 30 years ago, my better half and I were anxious to watch a documentary on the making of Jean Shepherd's most famous movie.

The young, amatuer Canadian couple who produced this documentary present themselves as fanatical fans of this beloved holiday movie.  Unfortunately, their enthusiam results in scenes, dialog, and behaviour that is at times almost too cutesy to bare without an insulin injection.  The box cover of the DVD gives you an idea of what I mean.

While we enjoyed getting to view shooting locations, props, and costumes from the movie's production, too often time is wasted trying to elicit a reaction of amazement from people who simply happen to be standing at these locations.  More often than not, it falls flat as most people simply are not as fanatical as the film makers portray themselves.

While I am appreciative of their time and efforts invested to present these places and artifacts to us fans; at times I found it amazing that they seemed to find determing certain film locations and facts so difficult to research.  It has obviously been a few years since this film was made, but the internet did already exist by this point in time and you later discover via the credits that they spent something like 3 years making this film.  Either they were not as excited to complete this ""road trip"" as they wish you to believe or they simply lack in research skills.

Nevertheless, we did enjoy learning a bit more about the making of the movie, although we found it somewhat typical of the younger, ""A Christmas Story"" supposed mega fan that there was virtually no mention of the man who single-handedly was responsible for the creation of our friend, Ralphie.

If you are an Amazon Prime member who truly loves the ""A Christmas Story"" movie and who would enjoy getting a bit of a backstage look at its making, this movie may be worth an investment of your time.",1416441600,4,1971,4.703488372093023

I agree with other reviewers that quick shots from the original movie would have been much better than just including text references.  Overall, still really enjoyed watching this production to give me some of the 'behind the scenes' looks.",1388707200,5,470,5.226666666666667
4530359,4,B0052O3OAW,This was actually a really neat documentary on a great Christmas Classic. It was way more interesting and informative than the bonus material on the special edition DVD.,1388707200,2,169,5.071428571428571
4530360,4,B0052O3OAW,"The Schwartz's had so much fun making this, I was a bit jealous that I didn't do it. Wait a minute. They did all the legwork, so just maybe I will do it now that they have blazed the path. Thanks for a fun and memorable trip.",1388620800,2,225,3.8085106382978724
4530361,2,B0052O3OAW,Terrible production value.  Minimal scripting.  Bad direction.  Bad storytelling and formatting.  Pace is painful.  Didn't reserve rights to include movie clips.  Poor interviews.  Not worth your time.,1388448000,,201,6.222222222222222
4530362,5,B0052O3OAW,"If you're a huge fan of this movie (which obviously you are if you're watching this), you'll love this documentary. Very well done, and with visitations to all of the filming locations. Kudos to Jodie and Tyler for their hard work! It was much appreciated!",1388448000,,256,4.711111111111111
4530363,5,B0052O3OAW,"this was a great documentary ,showing all the places the movie was filmed ,Tyler and Jordie were funny and informative .",1388448000,2,120,4.761904761904762
4530364,4,B0052O3OAW,"This is worth the watch. It's not a high end production by any means, but still a one of a kind in information and location. I still have no idea how and why I watched the entire thing, but I did, and enjoyed it - so that should say something (it was enough for me to write a review on it as well). You'll get some good shots of the different locations, interviews with people involved, props and costume, and more... If you're bored, like documentaries, and are a fan of ""A Christmas Story"", give it a go!",1388188800,2,506,4.173469387755102
4530365,5,B0052O3OAW,"This is a fun little film we watched it on charismas day and enjoyed it.
This is not a big budget film. But glad I saw it.",1388188800,2,122,3.5555555555555554
4530366,4,B0052O3OAW,"What are you about to watch?  It's a home video of a couple finding out the filming locations and seeing real artifacts seen in the film.  It's not for everyone.  If you think it's cool to drive by a real filming location then you might like the film.  I've seen Christmas story probably a dozen times and in this documentary are things I didn't catch seeing the film.  For example:  Ever notice the leg lamp crate says ""This end up"" on one side and ""his end up"" on another?  There's a reason for that.",1388016000,2,502,4.276595744680851
8454066,5,B0052O3OAW,Watched this on TV. Starts out a little slow but has some very interesting stuff as they proceed. A Christmas Story buff will love this.,1527120000,,136,4.48
8454067,5,B0052O3OAW,My favorite movie for the holiday season. This was an awesome and fun documentary. A must watch!,1521590400,,96,4.705882352941177
8454068,1,B0052O3OAW,"Ok, I loved a Christmas Story, but this was the dumbest documentary I have ever seen. Totally Corny and poorly made. My husband made me watch it. And yeah, never again.",1514851200,,168,4.451612903225806
8454069,2,B0052O3OAW,"This could have been really good, but some really bad choices were made in the production of this homemade documentary. Why they decided to speed up the film during one of the potentially best parts of the documentary is mind blowing. They locate a wardrobe woman who worked on the film. She runs a costume rental business. Hidden away are the original costumes from A Christmas Story. Sounds cool right? Well, when they present the costumes they decided to speed up the film so you have to look at them at lightning speed. They zip right through one of the most interesting parts of the documentary yet linger forever at the spot where the tree lot USED TO BE. The tree lot has been replaced by some buildings, one being a tattoo parlor. It is here they decide to interview some complete moron who likes to become animated when speaking. Youll see. The other thing that I found jarring was the choice to have a cheap sound effect of jingling bells during the many read the screen inserts. It was like nails on a chalkboard. Youll see. I think if the female host had been real all of the time instead of trying to act, it would have been a more down to earth and engaging experience. That all aside, if you love A Christmas Story this is still worth a watch just to see some of the filming locations. Another thing to note is that this advertises the rescuing of the actual chalkboard from the school used in the movie. They visit the school during demolition, but never do we get to see the chalkboard. WTH?",1514160000,,1508,4.447653429602888
8454070,2,B0052O3OAW,I was very disappointed that they didn't goto Hammond Indiana where ralphy really grew up to the real Cleveland street. I am a yahoo from Griffith Indiana and have walked the same streets ralphy did. And the Indiana welcome center would have been a perfect place to go. Around. Christmas time they go all out on a Christmas. Story  they even have a little piggy mash potato contest and a father son oh fudge tire changing contest. And the do old time Christmas window displays. Just ike back in raphies day. And. You can go and see Santa and take a trip down a slide. I think if they would have went to there it would have been a way better movie. It is only about a mile from where the real ralphy  parker grew up,1513468800,,714,4.242647058823529
8454071,5,B0052O3OAW,"If you only watch one Christmas movie this year, please make it Roadtrip for Ralphie. Its a nail-biter to the end. The masterful reenactments and riveting interviews are not to be missed. The witty insights of the vehicle wrangler made me appreciate the movie so much more. I cant wait for the next Schwartz-Schwatz film!",1511481600,,321,4.8545454545454545
8454072,5,B0052O3OAW,"A wonderful homemade documentary by a couple who truly love the film. They spent two years tracking down every location (including the sound stage) used in the movie, some of which will be surprising. Like other reviewers here, I only wish MGM had allowed them to include snippets from the film illustrating the scenes they're referring to -- it could only help increase sales of the DVD. All in all, a wonderful companion piece to the movie! And if you're going to be in Cleveland over the holidays, make sure you visit A Christmas Story House and Museum!",1511481600,,556,4.683673469387755
