With the second tape in the series, you partake in New Year's Eve celebrations in Western Ukraine. You'll be mesmerized by a rainbow kaleidoscope of vibrant colors as Ukrainian costumes are displayed in a pageantry of dancers and singers, who recreate ancient traditional Christmas rituals. And, don't think that it's one country, one costume--not in the least! You're in for a surprising spectacle to the senses when you see the myriad colors twirling to the beat of Ukrainian songs and Ukrainian dance steps.

As a supplement, for the reader interested in learning more about the splendid, intricate Ukrainian folk costume (an integral part of the national culture of Ukraine), a well-researched reference book (bilingual in Ukrainian and English), which was five years in the making, may be obtained from: Natalia Danylenko, 121 Harvard Avenue, Somerdale, NJ 08083. This handsome coffee-table edition entitled `Ukrainian Folk Costume,' has 311 pages of color and black and white photos and illustrations to supplement its informative, voluminous text. The publication of this book was planned by the World Federation of Ukrainian Women's Organizations (SFUZhO). You'll be amazed at the scope of interesting and beautiful handmade and hand-embroidered costumes that there are from each region and from each oblast of Ukraine.

My Ukraine 2 (New Year's Eve) features a cast of hundreds as they entertain by engaging in song and dance and in vinshuvannia (greetings and wishes of well-being and future prosperity); and, you'll be entertained by Veryovka Ensemble; Marenych Trio; Bandura Players of Kyiv playing the bandura (the national instrument of Ukraine); Folklore-Ethnographic Ensembles from the Ivano-Frankivsk region and from the Chernihiv region; Alla Kudlay singing Laskavo Prosymo; and, Maria Stefyuk and Vasyl Zinkevych.

The traditional rituals of Christmas are recreated and re-enacted visually as mythology is given a face. It's a sight and sound extravaganza, a folklore festivity, and a cultural enrichment experience similar to total immersion. The songs are in Ukrainian, but the mood is easy to decipher and assimilate--you'll find yourself tapping your foot or humming along, even if you don't know or don't understand the lyrics.

My Ukraine 2 (New Year's Eve) is definitely worth owning. If you can't find a copy to purchase, then try to obtain it from your library through Interlibrary Loan--this videotape is definitely worthy of your time and deserves viewing!
