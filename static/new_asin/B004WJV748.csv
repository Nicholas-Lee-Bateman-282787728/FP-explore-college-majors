The band is in top form here, and not only deliver a most amazing first performance ever of ""Screamadelica"" in its entirety, but a high energy, blistering ""rock set"" as well (featuring songs like ""Jailbird"", ""Country Girl"", and of course, ""Rocks"").
I've been a fan of the Primals since 1990; the only consistent thing about them is their desire to (successfully) continue to always move forward. I'm so glad that in this case, they decided to celebrate their past instead, because it provided us with this wonderful reminder of just how great they've always been.
PRIMAL SCREAM....YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?!

8445223,3,B004WJV748,"Amazing show, great extras... although no 1080p hd video, also it might be a small detail but bothered me as a collector that the blu-ray came without a booklet or at least a sheet with the tracklisting inside...otherwise a good product.",1317427200,,237,4.804878048780488

8445225,4,B004WJV748,"Well it's finally here. After watching many fan videos on youtube, and reading of what some have described as a life-changing event, the officially released DVD is here to allow those not lucky enough to attend any of the shows live, to bear witness to the very first performances of Screamadelica in it's entirety.

And the performances do not disappoint. If ever there is a time that live renditions can surpass what many consider to be one of the best recorded works of the nineties, this may indeed be it. The majesty and triumph of every single song on the album is displayed here in front of a raucous and delirious sold out crowd in London's Olympia. Bobby Gillespie and boys are full-on and at their very best. The supporting cast is above and beyond what anyone could ever have hoped they would be. And the visuals? well it's almost indescribable.

Anyone who enjoyed early nineties british rock, will truly appreciate this show. Primal Scream at their best are acid house/70's era stones-esque/gospel tinged/with a fair amount of art-rock thrown in for good measure. Make no mistake though, despite the obvious influences, they carve their own style and groove. And it is indeed a beautiful thing to see and hear. Now while Bobby Gillespie has never been known for being the most engaging frontman, nor is he very creative in his stage movements, it only adds to the unique-ness and dark drug addicted mystery of Primal Scream live.

Every note can be heard quite clearly throughout the show. Which actually made me wonder, how much had been dubbed afterwards. But as most of these concert films obviously get the sound-fixing treatments, likewise, this one appears to be no exception. Aside from that the only quibble I have with this DVD is the director's choice of cinematographic style, which is to say, at times, it's as if you could be watching a beer commercial. Too many quick cuts, anonymous crowd shots, perhaps a bit too cliched in the feel and vibe of the show. And judging by the you-tube videos, the performances seem a little too note perfect. But despite those misgivings, I still have to give this DVD a 4 star rating. If you're a Primal Scream fan or not, you'll enjoy this show, if only for their live rendition of the extended ""ComeTogether"" Truly breathtaking, both musically and visually, and one can only sit and watch, completely enraptured. When art meets gospel, and hard rock and jazz!!!Music is music. and Today is a New Day! Live a small part of it with Primal Scream.",1307491200,5,2507,4.758620689655173
