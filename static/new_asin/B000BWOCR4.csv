8093644,5,B000BWOCR4,This movie is a must have for any John Wayne fan!  A great classic! One I would definitely recommend!,1169337600,,101,4.315789473684211
8093645,5,B000BWOCR4,"What is the matter with the American producers of DVDs?????  This is one of the greatest Westerns of all time, and it is not on DVD.  As usual, John Ford gets short shrift, when it comes to DVDs.  A lot of really lousy films get the full DVD treatment, but a true American classic is ignored.

UPDATE AS OF MARCH 2006: FROM dvdtimes.com: FORT APACHE WILL BE RELEASED IN JUNE AS PART OF A JOHN FORD PACKAGE:

""Warner Home Video have announced the Region 1 DVD release of The John Wayne-John Ford Collection for 6th June 2006. One of the greatest director-star combinations in the history of Hollywood gets the Warner Home Video deluxe DVD treatment with the June 6 release of The John Wayne-John Ford Collection, a ten-disc set featuring eight of the team's finest collaborations. Anchoring the Collection, and arriving just in time for Father's Day, is The Searchers: Ultimate Collector's Edition which includes a Two-Disc Special Edition DVD with extensive all-new bonus features, plus a full color 36-page press book, a 36-page reproduction of the original Dell comic book, filmmaker memos and correspondence, several behind-the-scenes photos and a mail-in theatrical poster.

""The collection also features a Stagecoach: Two Disc Special Edition, newly remastered and restored from the best available film elements and loaded with new bonus content and three titles making their DVD debuts: the classic western Fort Apache, and the stirring war films The Long Voyage Home and Wings of Eagles. Rounding out the set are the timeless classics She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and They Were Expendable (in new Amaray packaging) plus 3 Godfathers, which is available for the first time in wide release with this Collection.""",1140393600,9,1713,5.056737588652482
8093646,5,B000BWOCR4,"This is one of the Two Johns (Ford and Wayne) great westerns!  It also contains a great performance by Henry Fonda!  How can you have a ""Cavalry Trilogy"" (Rio Grande & She Wore a Yellow Ribbon are the the other two) when one third of it is not available in an American edition!  Shame on whoever owns the rights to this film!  Please publish it in a deluxe edition like Rio Grande!",1140307200,5,381,4.25
8093647,4,B000BWOCR4,"The best we can do is a Korean edition of this John Ford classic? And the intent is not to malign the Korean DVD industry, but rather to chastise the American producers for not releasing this great western.",1137456000,11,206,4.447368421052632
