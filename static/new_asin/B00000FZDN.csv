7908582,3,B00000FZDN,"Rather bland product.  Expected the 'true 5.1 experience' and rather got a product that took a stereo 2.0 channel production and uploaded it to a dvd.  Not only that, the video had everyone dressed with white wigs for no reason and the sound was made with very old equipment (hiss/noise/etc).  I mean, the video aspect of the dvd added absolutely NOTHING to the production, unless you were the friend/family of someone who was performing this set.

Overall what you could expect from a cassette of a classical performance from the '80's; not what you would expect from a 2000's dvd.  In the end, I gave it 3 stars because Vivaldi is quite the artist and the four seasons is one of the best works in classical history.  Couldn't mark down the product lower because it would discourage new persons from buying it; just wish there was a better more ""surround sound"" production in more recent times MIXED IN BLU RAY/THX and then released blu-ray/thx, NOT mixed stereo and then stored on a blu-ray disc.  That is all.",1357344000,3,1012,4.68361581920904
