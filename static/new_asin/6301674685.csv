7814290,5,6301674685,I got this as part of a sci fi mega pack. The story didn't have a whole lot of twists and was quite ET like. The tri-lateral alien was really different......and required some good puppeteer work because no cgi back then.,1442620800,,220,4.390243902439025
7814291,4,6301674685,"This is a PG family film with a science fiction background. It is fairly well dated to the 80's with large desk computers, floppy discs, and Space Invaders. Two young alien girls and a three eyed whatever stole away on a space ship and sneak into Wyoming, planet Earth. They want to prove they can fit in, even though they are different, the theme of this family feature.

They quickly meet Dirt (Ricky Paull Goldin.) Robyn (Sydney Penny) the older of the aliens, develops a quick mutual attraction as young love enters the film. A young Rosie Marcel plays her sister Tavy. Executive producer Talia Shire has a minor role. This was the final film for character actor Keenan Wynn (Grandpa) son of Ed Wynn. He appeared in over 200 films and TV episodes including Dr, Strangelove (Col. 'Bat' Guano).

The film moves along the ""ET"" lines, although not as intense or fun.  Grandparents are understanding and the first people a kid turns to when they need help. A 4 star family film, a 1 star science fiction film. Available is some science fiction DVD collections.",1351209600,2,1059,4.682795698924731
