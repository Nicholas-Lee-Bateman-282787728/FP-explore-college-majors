I do not recommend this product. The good video clips can be found on Youtube.",1462147200,,146,3.9

8682748,3,B00O9Y1C6E,"This is a collection of performance videos of John Fogerty from the past starting with more recent videos and ending with the oldest videos.  It's for JF fans as the quality leaves a lot to be desired.  The sound quality is OK and is mostly in sync with the video.  The video varies in quality from VHS to better and is in 3:4 format.  They are all pasted together with nothing in between.  There is no introduction or ending.  The video just stops.  Running time is 40 minutes.  There is an occasional dropout.  The DVD box is fine but there is no booklet inside or text on the back describing anything.  The song list is on the back and is displayed on the screen periodically during playback, sometimes taking up half the screen height.  There are 13 music performance videos and one interview and no extras.

The first 4 videos have a formal orchestra as a backing band.  JF with violins seems odd to hear!  There is also a choir supporting JF here as well.  The huge audience can best be described as polite.  For the next 4 videos JF had a more typical backing band with some members you will recognize.  One video here was recorded at a much higher volume so be ready to turn the volume down.  The change will make you jump!  The next video seems to be B+W but there is some faint color.  In the next 2 videos JF plays an acoustic guitar.  The sound quality is fine but the video quality is typical VHS.  The next video moves outdoors into a stadium with an older backing band and the last music video is of CCR.  It's B+W and poor in video quality.  The music and video are out of sync but the video jumps around so fast, it's hard to tell.  Finally an interview with a young JF is shown and then the video just stops.

My DVD was marked for region 0 (no region flag set) and it played OK on my region 1 DVD player.  You should confirm what type of DVD is being shipped to you and whether or not you can play it before you order it.  Also the price of this DVD varies 2:1 so shop around.  You are not going to get much for your money, no matter how much you spend!  JF collectors will add it to their collection but this shouldn't be your first JF video.",1430784000,9,2162,4.189781021897811
