7833232,4,6302985668,"As a Yankee fan I hated this series.  The Braves had a young upstart lineup with Aaron, Bruton, and Covington in the outfield and Eddie Matthews at third, Johnny Logan at short, Red Scheindienst at second, Frank Torre at first (Joe Torre's older brother) and Del Crandall behind the plate. Of course they also had the great and feared Warren Spahn.  But it was Lou Burdette who had the Yankees number.  He started 3 games and won all 3!",1207440000,37,436,4.493670886075949
