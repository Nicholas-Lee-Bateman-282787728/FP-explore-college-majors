8030217,4,B0002PC2RC,I have enjoyed watching this series at my own leisure - having missed many episodes when it ran on tv. I love the irreverent tone of the English dubbing which captures both the gestures and characters so well. At times the show resembles or borders on the 'pythonesque' with its absurd humour grounded in 'realistic' scenarios. Living and working in Hong Kong I have also learned a lot about Buddhism in the Far East from this show and how the original literary classic (The Journey to The West) still resonates strongly in contemporary Eastern art and culture. Relaxing edutainment that makes you laugh out loud.,1398729600,2,613,4.847619047619047
8030218,5,B0002PC2RC,I love Monkey Magic! I grew up watching this in Japan. Does this dvd offer language option? Can I watch it in Japanese as well or is it only in English? I'm in Japan and I haven't seen this complete season dvd set here.,1388793600,,219,4.0
8030219,5,B0002PC2RC,"Exactly what was promised. A good-humoured epic of psychologically impaired spirit-creatures, Kung-Fu, Buddhist Philosophy and a great story to boot. Many episodes are marked as age 12+ which seems a bit excessive (there is a LOT of fighting, mock Kung-Fu battles). Perhaps the age restriction is for the philosophy - or perhaps it is ...the gruesome beheading in an early episode.",1381708800,,381,5.262295081967213
8030220,5,B0002PC2RC,What a blast from the past. My kids love it just as much as my husband and I do and did.,1368230400,,88,3.238095238095238
8030221,5,B0002PC2RC,Who doesn't love Monkey!  I grew up on this and it is still so great to watch..  Probably not well known in the US but in Australia (where I'm from) its the best!,1364256000,4,162,3.878787878787879
