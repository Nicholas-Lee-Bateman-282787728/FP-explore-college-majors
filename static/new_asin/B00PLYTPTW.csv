8688635,1,B00PLYTPTW,"I thought for the price, anything with area 51 would be amazing. Please take this seriously. The three movies on this disc are terrible. If you love zombie movies, this is your kind of stuff. If you like twists and guts and people vomiting, this is the movie for you. Let's start with Alien Armageddon. Aliens have arrived and we are their food supply. Not only that, but we are fed buckets of flesh bowls. We don't know that, but we are eating ourselve and added to the human flesh bowls, the aliens have poisoned the food with their own virus, helping us become...spicier, like salt and pepper. tenderized. We get sick, we vomit and we get sicker. Women are tied to a bed, legs propped up, and buckets are right where you think they are.  And they are  laying baby alien slug balls that will soon be alien worms. You can hear everywhere as countless women are giving birth to the slugs. And you hear and see theses slugs drop into a bucket.. Plop another alien worm. Now comes the twist. Scientists are injecting humans with a virus that will kill the aliens off. A virus that will wipe them out,  but of course the aliens have to eat us first and then, they get sick and die. Those that are alive, fly way in their spaceships, In search of another food supplied planet.. That is the first movie on the disc. Briefly, second show is called Alien Uprising. Aliens arrive, they take control very fast, because for years, they have lived among us  And the person you think is a cool dude or a fabulous chick ends up being an alien. ""Is your neighbor an alien?"" Acting is bad...real bad And finally the last movie on the disc is titled, Total Retribution.. I think it takes place on a space station above Earth. Weird people running through the corridors killing each other or fighting each other or trying to tell the other people they are the good guys. It's very hard to follow and worse, you can't even remember names. If names are known at all. One woman is supposed to be bad and the good guys get tired of fighting, so they include her in their good plans. She follows them a bit and goes off to do her own stuff. But I don;t know what that is and after a while you don't care what it is. You're lost and prefer to end it there and watch the news of the day...That's the three movies, on one disc, you get for one low price. I took a pair of scissors and scratched the disc.and tossed it into the trash. If you saw my library of movies, you would gasp. She did that? I'm a serious collector and I love movies, especially about  aliens / area 51 movies. I was raise near Hobbs New Mexico, need I say more. Before you buy this disc. Please remember, It's full of people vomiting, eating each other, vomiting some more, and the acting was just as nasty. But if you like the zombie pictures with the guts and intestines being pulled out of the living and chowed down on,  this is the right kind of movie for you.  On a happier note. The movie arrived on time, in good condition.",1461369600,,2979,4.308928571428571
