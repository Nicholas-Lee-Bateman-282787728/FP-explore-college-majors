1853005,5,B00008N72P,"HORRIBLE COPY OF COURSE SINCE MY COMPUTER SCREEN WASN'T BIG ENOUGH TO SEE THE PRODUCED BY AMAZON ON DEMAND AT THE BOTTOM . WHY OH WHY DIDN'T I SCROLL UP !!!! THE NOW YOU SEE IT CLEARLY NOW YOU DON'T SAME OLD ""CAN'T COMPRESS A DVD TO SAVE THEIR LIVES CRAP""...gotta love the irony since I had just bought my third copy of Kuch na kaho because of my own stupidity. The third one was not from them and it is a real production from Eros. Going to order direct from now on . Enough is enough.

PLOT
Saif Ali Khan is a can't settle down for one girl playboy and his parents are sick of his attitude always partying never thinking about his future . After they try for the last time to fix him up with a beautiful sweet and intelligent young woman, he lies to her with a ridiculous story of how his parents weren't that sweet and they would make horrible inlaws...she walks back in the room after she says yes she understands and tells THEM she can't marry their son because he is a liar.  He's somewhat floored she figured it out..sigh...His best friend (Hrithik Roshan ) who is the son of wealthy industrialist but was raised with him like a  brother states he will look up this girl that he thinks might be perfect for him...He's not interested in her for himself because for years he has been writing someone as first a pen pal and now a romantic theme has intrenched  itself in their letters...two post boxes, two sets of letters one from him one from her. He doesn't know her name and she doesn't know his. This sets up your scenario for love, impediments there of, and a surprise ending that I didn't see coming.

 Fun ,IF YET BLURRY, Movie.  THE HUMOR IS WITTY AND PLENTY OF IT. GREAT WRITING FOR THIS GENRE. The actors are perfect with the emotional scenes. Good job all around. It's usually all predictable but despite the typical scenario they manage to have some fresh moments and the colors and scenery are very good. There are the usual moments when you want to slap the crap out of them for being so stupid as to make that big a sacrifice but since all worked out in the end I forgive them . This is done in the usual format of humor in  the front end and more melodrama later .Only one scene of singing in the Alps I promise. lol. Where are those tissues sob sob. GET IT AND ENJOY. JUST GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR YOUR COPY BESIDES AMAZON. *****I went direct for my second copy to a amazon supplier called FRIENDS..the copy is good even though didn't qualify for free shipping via amazon prime it came to around 10 for the whole thing so not bad price . That included 2.98 shipping. ******",1337731200,,2592,4.308008213552362
1853006,4,B00008N72P,"I'm a sucker for Hrithik Roshan romances (and I like Saif Ali Khan too). This is a good one and I wasn't disappointed.
It took me a while to get round to watching this though as the cover looked like a still from 'A Few Good Men' or a CIA action movie and I was looking for something lighter. IGNORE the cover picture! This is really Bollywood light romance of the triangle kind and the sunglasses on the cover are 'cool'.
WE have 2 long time friends. One (Hrithik) sets up a letter writing relationship with Esha (Esha Deol) but they never meet and don't know who each other is. Then fate takes a hand and Hrithik mediates a marriage between Esha and his friend (Saif). Then he realizes too late who Esha really is. This movie is about God taking a hand so you may guess what pans out by the end of 159 minutes.
I enjoyed this one. It was a little slow at the beginning and Esha looked very much too young for Hrithik originally and it didn't mesh. She shed her schoolgirl gear and pigtails and went into young woman and it settled down. Esha was actually very lively and able to convey a range of emotions and was good - as naturally Hrithik and Saif also were.
There's a few good tunes, some decent Hrithik (and Saif) dancing (though don't think too much about why they jumped to some of their fanciful images and locations!)
I liked this one but I see elsewhere on the Net it is often seen as anywhere from just average to above average. This is a keeper.",1239580800,12,1459,4.270758122743683
1853007,4,B00008N72P,"Three and a half stars for NA TUM JAANO NA HUM.

In today's busy technological age, the e-mail rules all. But I have to believe that there's a place still for the age-old tradition of exchanging thoughts and emotions thru letters. A letter will always be more romantic and more personal than an e-mail, so sayeth I. So, despite that this film came out in 2002, I easily bought into the plot device which calls for the two central characters corresponding via ""snail mail.""

The premise of NA TUM JAANO NA HUM (Neither You Know Nor I) borrows from Jimmy Stewart's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shop-Around-the-Corner/dp/B00006FDCV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shop Around the Corner</a>, Judy Garland's musical&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Good-Old-Summertime/dp/B0001DCYU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Good Old Summertime</a>&nbsp;and even from the more recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-ve-Got-Mail-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B000YDBPAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You've Got Mail (Deluxe Edition)</a>. Hrithik Roshan and Esha Deol are cast as photographer Rahul and recent college graduate Esha, two strangers who, thanks to a radio station, become anonymous pen pals. Rahul and Esha are romantic dreamers and, as they get to know each other thru their correspondence, they fall in love, never mind that they haven't seen each other or know each other's names. Things keep on like this for a while, with the two content with merely composing and posting until, fueled by the engine of the Almighty Movie Coincidence, Esha hires Rahul for a photography gig, and so they finally meet each other in person, although both continue to be oblivious. So usher in all those cute and savory romantic moments, as these two strike up a friendship.

Saif Ali Khan steps in and either upsets the apple cart or becomes the impetus for the love story to really kick off. He plays Akshay, a carefree playboy and Rahul's best friend since childhood. And because coincidences surface in Bollywood as frequently as musical numbers, it turns out that Akshay and Esha's parents are old chums and, so, an arranged marriage is proposed for their kids. Which leaves Rahul torn in the middle. Because he's just learned that Esha is the one from the letters, but, too, that Akshay has just fallen in love with her. Rahul's heartbreaking dilemma being: is love stronger than friendship?

This is what Bollywood delights in. That aching love story, the intolerable situation, the self-sacrificing hero. The extent to which Bollywood relishes torturing its star-crossed lovers is demonstrated in this film as four years elapse in the characters' lives before there's even a smidgen of a happy ending. And, other than Shahrukh Khan, no one else weeps manfully and suffers the woes of love quite like Hrithik Roshan, and when you factor in his danceability, then no wonder womenfolk swoon all over this cat. There's no doubting that NA TUM JAANO NA HUM is graced by solid acting. Roshan does well, and you're on his side from the get-go. Even his unwitting rival, played by Saif Ali Khan, is someone you can't help but like, partly because Saif is innately a likeable dude. I've seen Esha Deol in other movies, but this is probably where she impresses me the most. She's got them big eyes and sweet personality, but I thought she did well with the latter stages of the film, when she'd metamorphosed from frolicky young innocence to heartbroken and resigned maturity. I ain't too embarassed to admit that I caught a lump in the throat when she finally learns that Rohil is indeed the one scribbling from Post Office Box #143.

Normal for Indian cinema, this flick is over two and a half hours long, so clear out your day planner. NA TUM JAANO NA HUM is a darn good love story and the hook is undeniable, even if at times the movie lingers much too much on the melodramatic moments. You'll groan and roll your eyes some as the humor tends to be silly, especially that scene of Hrithik and Saif in the gym locker room and that other dude. But I did laugh out loud at the sequence which has Hrithik and Esha forced to act in a music video. At times, Bollywood isn't too big for its britches to poke fun at itself.

Bollywood has presented other love stories more rapturous and sweeping that NA TUM JAANO NA HUM, sure. Just check out Shahrukh Khan and Kajol's stuff (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kuch-Kuch-Hota-Hai/dp/B0000AZT4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dilwale-Dulhania-Le-Jayenge-2DISC-SET/dp/B000Z9PWKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (2DISC SET)</a>),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hum-Dil-De-Chuke-Sanam/dp/B000MCH08Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jab-We-Met/dp/B001165BG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jab We Met</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Namastey-London-DVD/dp/B000R939DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Namastey London DVD</a>. I feel that NA TUM JAANO NA HUM falls somewhere under these classics. But it most definitely has its merits and is well worth watching. Somewhere, Jimmy Stewart is probably smiling and stammering in approval. Judy Garland probably is, too (smiling, not stammering), and she's also probably feeling a bit smug because the songs in her version easily top the lackluster numbers in this one.",1233360000,3,5701,5.997542997542998
1853008,4,B00008N72P,"I'm not Hindustani.  But this movie and most of the Bollywood movies make me so jealous that I'm not!  I LOVE HINDI FILMS...(or BOLLYWOOD movies!)  If you haven't seen any..you are in for a treat.  The dancing, the singing, the costumes, the actors...marvelous!

Sometimes the style may be a bit hard for Americans to take....because they are often not ""realistic"".  But I LOVE the way they highlight love and family.  So many of the joys of life and the virtues that make life worth living...these are in these movies!

Bollywood people really know how to make movies.  Hollywood movies could only dream of coming EVEN close!  The actors are handsome and absolutely entrancing...and the actresses are the most beautiful in the world!

And this movie has the most handsome man in the whole world in it!

Hrithik Roshan is gorgeous as usual...and playing the self-sacrificing hero as usual!  He is one of the MOST talented actors in Bollywood...and in the whole world!  Esha Deol is so cute in this movie.  And Saif Ali Khan is his usual crazy wonderful self!  A love triangle...Hindi style!

Which is not American style!

Might not be the best 1st Bollywood to watch... they look at love and marriage a little more seriously than Americans do!  And family, especially parents, are SO important!

Not the best...but very sweet!",1170460800,10,1326,4.860986547085202

I would hope that we all have that friend in someone! I honestly hope and pray that we all get to have this amazing love and amazing friendship!! Can't wait to own all of Hrithik Roshan's movies!!!

7985577,5,B00008N72P,"I admit it, I have a problem, I'm addicted to Hrithik Roshan movies. There they say admitting it is the first step to recovery. The funny thing is I have no desire to recover! Adding Saif Ali Khan to the addiction spells my doom. These two have a lot in common: they're funny, talented, intelligent, and each gorgeous. It's a good thing they didn't go to high school together! Mr. Khan would have had to pull out his trump card the tiny fact that he's a prince! It's true life is not fair.

Ever since I discovered Bollywood I wanted to see these two in a movie and to prove wishes come true I found this. After reading the synopsis and reviews I was expecting something like ""You've Got Mail"" ""A Shop Around The Corner"" and ""In The Good Old Summertime"" these are favorites of mine, but to be honest the only thing that this has in common with them is the fact that two people fall in love through letters. The differences far exceed the similarities. The most glaring is the tiny fact that our two literary love-birds are not enemies by day! That is the lynch pin of the other films. Rahul and Esha get along great in person, if they weren't so crazy for their paper selves they might have gotten together quickly.

I don't typically laugh-out-loud at movies. I'm defective that way. This movie made me laugh madly so five stars it gets.  It does suffer from one big flaw, the sound effects! I don't know why it took so long to ditch the dated annoying sound effects but they had them in this one. Other than that this film is just what a romantic needs. So lets talk performances

I feel like doing ladies first... Esha Deol, is lovely and lively as Esha (why she shares a name with her character I'm not sure) she can handle silly crazy scenes with grace and fun then turn around and handle deep emotional scenes with real sensitivity. She's also a lovely dancer who has no trouble keeping up with the illustrious Hrithik. Okay I can't say every dance was worthy of adulation because not every one was. But it had nothing to do with the dancer's talent. The one very important dance was great fun. Now granted my bias for Aishwarya Rai Bachchan runs deep but Ms. Deol has great chemistry with her leading man. Out of all the leading ladies I've seen Mr. Roshan paired with she's in the top three. Whether she comes in second or third I'll know when I see him with Katrina Kaif.

Now for the most charming ""bad boy"" I've found in Bollywood films, Mr. Saif Ali Khan. If he ever goes to Hollywood well a lot of American megastars are going to be struck with inferiority complexes. He's got more charm and sex appeal in the tip of his nose than should be healthy. Make no mistake the man knows how to use it! He might not be the most amazing dancer on the planet but he's a very good actor it's not easy to play shallow, self-centered, and oblivious, while remaining likeable. Another Khan (Sharuhk) played such characters in his younger days to massive success, Saif Ali Khan always adds some type of edge or twist that keeps the game fresh. He's the type who makes the very very good girls like me nervous when he smiles. He can charm the devil himself. But don't judge the man simply by his glamorous modern characters. He's capable of a lot more! See ""Race"" and you'll see a ruthless scary antihero who uses that deadly charm in a whole different context. Like his new bride Kareena Kapoor-Khan there's more to him than high glamour roles. Still Akshay makes you love him even if you can't root for him. It's the charm, it should be classified as a lethal weapon.

Okay I've put it off for long enough, as much as I adore the Nawab of the Khans, Hrithik Roshan is the Shahensha (emperor) of my Bollywood world. He's perfect as Rahul, sensitive, traditional while not being oppressive, he's the angel to Akshay's charming devil. Just don't insinuate that the woman he loves is a prostitute, he gets scary and the bad sound effects happen. I've gushed about Mr. Roshan's talent before and everything I've said still applies. Since I bought two other movies of his I'll save more for later. He's fantastic in this film like always.

Technical review: in the interest of honesty this copy by Eros isn't perfect. The picture can get grainy for a few seconds in spots. They said there's a bonus disk and there isn't. For me this is not a big deal.

Music: for the most part Rajesh Roshan (Hrithik's Uncle) has put together an adaquate if unremarkable soundtrack. There are two wonderful songs. Jaa Sanam Muhjko Hai is exquisite, as is Tum Meri Bahoien Mein Aa Na Sake. Coincedently these are the songs Mr. Hrithik Roshan raved about in his special features interview! That's done in English!

Obviously I like this movie Aa lot. I highly reccomend it.",1354147200,2,4748,4.486111111111111
