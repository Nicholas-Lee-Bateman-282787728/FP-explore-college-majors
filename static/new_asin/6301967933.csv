388258,5,6301967933,"Hopefully someday this one will be re-released on DVD, because it's simply a great film-noir. Making a superb B-movie is no simple task. It takes ingenuity, guts, and vision. Something most mainstream multi-million dollar movies don't even come close to having. Joseph Lewis (also directed the Big Combo) does a masterful job directing, and John Dall and Peggy Cummings are perfect in their roles. No attempt is made to justify or explain away the motivations of the two characters except that they ""...go together like guns and ammunition"".",1050969600,4,541,5.159090909090909
388259,5,6301967933,"""Gun Crazy"" was recently included in the National Film Registry and has been called by many the greatest B film ever made.  Joseph Lewis, an ingenious director noted for getting astounding results from small budgets, made two of the most acclaimed B successes in film annals, the other being ""The Big Combo.""  In the latter film he had recent Oscar-winning screenwriter Philip Yordan put his ideas on paper.  With the 1949 psychological noir spellbinder ""Gun Crazy"" Lewis had future Pulitzer Prize-winning author MacKinlay Cantor adapt his story to the screen along with future Oscar-winning scenarist Dalton Trumbo, whose name credit for the film is Millard Kaufman, a move resulting from the uncertainty of the blacklist period.
""Gun Crazy"" includes one of the most unusual seduction scenes recorded on film.  When the ultimately wayward love duo of John Dall and Peggy Cummins initially meet it is at a traveling carnival, where the sexy young blonde is the Annie Oakley-styled sharpshooter.  She takes on all comers in competition, and meets more than her match in Dall, who ultimately triumphs over her.  This is the only scene you will ever see where an act of seduction occurs while the sharpshooters take turns shooting out candles atop each other's heads.  The more intense the competition, the greater the sexual intensity building between the pair.  Cummins ends up more intrigued and sexually aroused than ever after losing the competition to Dall, displaying open admiration for the only sharpshooter to defeat her at her own game.
Before long they pull out of the carnival, infuriating the carnival's boss, who was Cummins' lover.  Dall immediately proposes and they marry, despite Cummins' cautionary warning that she is ""no good.""  Totally smitten, Dall tells her that she will become a better person.  She promises to try but ultimately falls short.
The intriguing psychological element of this film is that Dall, while loving guns and an excellent sharpshooter, has a pronounced non-violent streak.  Cummins, whose love for guns equals his own, has an equally pronounced psychotic violent streak.  Despite Dall's verbal opposition, he agrees to go along with her on a Midwest robbery spree reminiscent of the antics of Bonnie and Clyde.
The clashing psychologies of Cummins and Dall must ultimately prompt the sensitive young man to make a decision as to how far he will follow his assertive wife.  He agrees to undertake one more job at an Armour meatpacking plan, but this holdup sets them off on a critical survival course.  Ultimately Dall must choose between his devotion to Cummins and attempting to kill one of his best boyhood friends, now the sheriff of the town where he grew up.
This film never degenerates into sensationalism or violence for its own sake.  It is a serious study of the roots of violence in American society with a strong emphasis on the popularity of guns in U.S. culture.",1019260800,22,2919,5.062630480167015
388260,4,6301967933,"For manic intensity, this ranks as one of the absolute best films noir.  With no well known cast members, the director Joseph Lewis crafted a high-powered, fluid film that moves like a bat out of hell.
Two lovers on the run, played by John Dall and Peggy Cummins, originally meet at a circus where she's the Annie Oakley sharpshooter and he's the guy who's an even better shot than she is---and proves it in a contest in which he shoots five candles out, placed on her head, while she manages only four of the five on his.  Her admiration soars for the guy, as does her obvious sexual attraction, and before you can say ""Rumpelstilskin"" (or however it's spelled), the two of them are a hot and bothered item.
This searing chemistry is what gives the film its incredible momentum as the two go on a robbing spree that more than gives any movie since a run for the money--Bonnie and Clyde, Love and a .45, etc., etc.  This is the forerunner of all these guys, and it's very likely the best of them.
The equally strong ending is a perfect capper for a truly classic film noir. It's a shame this is out of print on VHS and that no studio is interested in putting out a DVD.
Highly recommended.",1017100800,3,1189,4.3710407239819
388261,4,6301967933,"Gun Crazy is a tale of the symbiotic relationship between two sharpshooters: he's a gentle soul who likes guns and loves her; she's a psychopath who winds him up like a cheap watch.
They rob their way across mid-west, get chased by the cops, kill a few people on the way.  But when push comes to shove, when the smart money says ""split up"", they can't bear to be apart.
It's a Pre-""Bonnie and Clyde"" ""Bonnie And Clyde""; a perverse mixture of sadism and sympathy.
For Afficionadoes:
Joseph H Lewis was on of those B-Movie directors who knew how to make his limitations into strengths.  As a result there are some amazing camera moves, car-rigs, lighting set-ups, and all round great cutting.
The set-piece is the one-take real-time bank robbery, shot in a town of people most of whome didn't know anyone was making a film.  It saved Lewis a day of shooting, and I haven't seen it's equal.
The Practicle Car-Rigs used were unusual for their time (there's very little rear-projection.

The film begins with a teenager who breaks a glass window to steal a pistol, and is caught. As a boy he killed a young chick with a BB gun. The judge is told about this boy's fascination with guns. Is it caused by the lack of a father? Bart likes to shoot guns. He needs a new environment to help him grow up. Years later he returns to town. They visit an old-time carnival, entertainment for the small towns of America. [Would OSHA allow those working conditions today?] Bart is a good shot. The clown explains how this carnival fleeces their customer. Bart learns about personal relationships. But this couple seems to be doomed because of their poor choices. After a series of robberies the police start gaining on them, and learn their names.

They want to flee the country so they plan the perfect job. Will they be always together? Their next job is at a meat packing plant. [Symbolism?] The robbers are armed and dangerous, the police will shoot to kill! But they escape to California. Their loot is traced by serial numbers, the FBI know where they are. The visit a carnival for entertainment. The police detectives are closing in. They flee to a park where they are trapped. [You can guess how this ends for them.]

Are the star actors believable as the characters they portray? Does this film seem like an unconscious parody? One advantage is the sights of by-gone carnivals.

388343,5,6301967933,"Gun Crazy was an independent production made without any big name stars, yet it fascinates me and I pull it out every now and then for a repeat viewing. The script when laid out blow by blow seems almost pedestrian - a Bonnie and Clyde story with no real surprises but without the Depression as a backdrop as a possible motivation for all of this mayhem.

Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, though, this story is set in booming post-war America. Bart is a guy who loves guns but cannot kill. He killed a chick once as a child and as a result of the overwhelming remorse he felt cannot even bring himself to shoot a menacing animal with a bounty on it years later. Bart has good friends, a sister who seems to be well grounded and has been taking care of Bart since their parents' death, yet he commits a crime to get a gun when he's about fourteen when he's got to know this seemingly impulsive act will mean he's caught almost immediately - he is. He's sent to reform school for the theft, goes into the Army for four years but does not see combat, and here it is the present - 1950 - and he's returned home for a visit.

So here Bart is an adult, he has good support from family and friends but he's still gun crazy and has the misfortune of running into sure shot Annie Laurie (Peggy Cummins), a little lady who has big dreams without the problem of a pesky conscience. So Bart's dilemma is that of so many in film noir - a bad set of coincidences coupled with a fundamental character flaw - he just can't say no to Annie Laurie. If he hadn't gone to the carnival that night and done trick shooting against Annie Laurie in a scene that sure looks like foreplay with guns, he probably would have gotten that job with Remington for forty bucks a week and been happy with that. But here he is, in the sexual clutches of a femme fatale who is ""dead behind these eyes"" - to quote another movie entirely.

Initially, Annie seems to pick Bart because he is a straight arrow, someone who genuinely cares for her, and right before they marry she even vows to ""try to be good"". Bart goes for Annie Laurie because he can't believe that a girl so pretty and so exciting seems to ""get"" him and actually wants an ordinary working stiff like himself - but isn't this how so many guys feel on their wedding day?

Ultimately their curse is their first impressions of each other were correct - Bart is basically a straight arrow, and Annie Laurie is exciting and craves a constant high level of excitement - and danger - in her life. So to keep Annie, Bart has to feed her with big wads of cash and even bigger wads of excitement that can only come from robbery, and with armed robbery there's always the chance of murder, and we all know what happens to murderers in the age of the production code.

This film is so visually interesting. One reason I think I like it so much is I like to look around in a scene and just not at the players. Also it has that great and powerful score going for it and Bart and Annie's song ""Mad About You"" which is so true of both of them but in very different ways. Plus you never get ""inside"" the characters to find out why they might have turned out this way. Why is Bart so weak? Why is Annie so bad? Remember, this may be 1950, but these two grew up in the Depression and who knows what they saw as kids. It's all left for you to fill in the blanks. Highly recommended.",1433721600,,3381,4.219474497681607
388344,4,6301967933,"The best reasons to get this film are because, first of all it's extremely entertaining.  Also, it's fast-paced and exciting.  It shows what great writing, talented actors, an unusual, interesting plot, an excellent music score and fine direction can do for a film despite a small budget.  If the creativity is there, amazing things can happen.  Not sure if it fits the technical definition of film noir or not, but it is at least film gris (film gray).  It has a dark theme and rings true to human nature -- often at its worst.

The story, in brief, is about a young, troubled but basically decent young man who meets an attractive woman with a similar interest.  They both love guns; he loves them more as physical objects and a way to express his skill as a marksman.  She is a marksman (markswoman, marksperson?) too and loves them because they bring her power and control and are a way to satisfy her psychological appetites, her lust for control and a wealthier lifestyle.  She is what we used to call a bad girl...

The male protagonist starts out as a person who is fascinated by guns to the point that as a youth he steals one and is placed in a juvenile facility for his crime.  When he is released, he does his best to live a decent life.  He is a great marksman and sort of a gentle guy and doesn't use guns to do harm.  Then he meets the girl.

Not exactly a good influence, she in many ways is his polar opposite:  although she loves guns and is an excellent shot, shooting professionally in a traveling circus, she was, I suspect, born defective --  she has no moral compass.  Not even a tiny one.  She is very attractive and the nice guy eagerly jumps into the vortex of her sexual seductiveness, manipulation and destructiveness.  Peggy Cummins, who plays the fatal femme, is seductive and highly-persuasive in a nice, innocent-appearing girl type of way.  BUT, this is someone with a big personal agenda, although I bet she would be a lot of fun at a party (if she didn't bring her gun).  John Dall, the schlemiel, surrenders completely to her will.  She is powerfully manipulative and he is manipulable and seducible, loving every minute of it -- until he eventually realizes that she is completely without real feeling and doesn't really give a damn what's right or wrong; nothing merits compassion nor mercy and everything must serve her needs and the classic, narcissistic nature of her psychopathic personality.  She is a sharp knife wrapped in chocolate.  This cute, innocent-looking chick is BTBN (Big Time Bad News).  She is dominant, he is submissive, poor boy, and goes along for the roller coaster ride of his life.

She gets worse and worse, egging him on to commit various crimes with her, every crime seeming to end in a shooting and murder.  She likes it that way -- killing is a big kick; he is appalled but still submissive.  Together, they are a complete natural disaster.  I won't tell you more -- other than there is an exciting climax.

What I liked best about this great film:  never a dull moment after an ambling start; interesting camera angles and unusual-for-the-period shots; plenty of action; a great score by Victor Young incorporating a couple of his best songs; and, the performance of Peggy Cummins, which I found compelling, relentless and seductive.  I could easily believe a guy falling for her petite beauty -- and unwittingly entering the gates of hell as a result -- while having a certain amount of pleasure doing it.  This is really the story of the conflict between a genuine psychopath and a ""normal"" person who doesn't ever realize exactly what he's dealing with and yet feels powerless to resist.  I found the  characters to be honest and the motivations and interactions real, something you don't find that often.  I also liked the fact that there are a lot of on-location shots that show an America that no longer exists, along with the old cars and interiors of some real buildings, including a bank.  Are you old enough to remember when bank interiors were completely unenclosed and the tellers didn't live behind clear bulletproof cages like rabbits in a pet shop?  There is definitely an element of nostalgia in this B/W film and it adds another dimension to the story -- which could easily be just as relevant and real today as it was when this film was made.  It's an entertaining little treasure.",1431907200,,4368,4.660130718954249

As cannily directed by Joseph H. Lewis, there is a feral, white-heat energy that fuels this film from start to finish. Lewis manages to make the film jump back and forth from documentary-like to highly stylized with quicksilver cuts, the sum of which somehow melds together into a crazy-great melodrama that clearly serves as the precursor for later couple-on-the lam movie classics such as Arthur Penn's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bonnie-and-Clyde/dp/B0010YVCI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bonnie and Clyde</a>&nbsp;and Terrence Malick's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Badlands/dp/B00AQ6J5JU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Badlands</a>.  Written by Dalton Trumbo (under a pseudonym as he was blacklisted at the time), the story is pretty basic. Bart Tare is an orphan whose obsession with handguns starts pretty early in his life. Motivated by what he sees as his own self-worth, he becomes an expert sharpshooter as he moves from reform school to a stint in the Army and then to an uncertain existence as Bart isn't sure what he's supposed to do with his life.

Enter Annie Laurie Starr, a dead-shot trick-shooter who comes to town as part of a traveling carnival, and the fireworks ignite immediately when she shoots at him with a prop gun and then competes in a marksmanship contest where each shoots matchsticks on a crown placed on the other's head. This audacious bit of foreplay is only the beginning when he impulsively decides he wants to marry her, and in turn, she convinces him to go on a cross-country crime spree to live the life of Riley. He willingly goes along with the plan, but self-doubt strikes him at every adverse turn. Annie, on the other hand, is a classic ""bad"" girl who shoots people dead out of an addictive fear of getting trapped, but she genuinely falls in love with Bart when she recognizes how much he is willing to sacrifice of himself to be with her. Their torturous relationship is offset by some fascinating set pieces like an unedited bank robbery scene near the film's midpoint where the camera is planted in the backseat of a car the couple has just stolen. The actors feel like they're improvising their dialogue during a single take of several minutes' duration.

The robbery occurs off-camera, and after she pistol-whips a local cop, the two get away as shots are fired at them. Their clean escape is captured perfectly in Annie's face as she smiles in an almost post-coital fashion that summarizes the dark nature of her character perfectly. The actors give blazing performances that make indelible impressions. John Dall is an interesting footnote in mid-century American cinema as he only made a handful of films, the most famous being Alfred Hitchcock's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rope/dp/B002RPPNZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rope</a>&nbsp;where he played one of a pair of gay murderers. As Bart, he conveys his character's constant self-doubt and false bravado with precision, even if he does seem over-the-top in a few key scenes. A petite Welsh-born beauty, Peggy Cummins was supposed to be a big star three years earlier when she was cast in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forever-Amber/dp/B00005JP2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forever Amber</a>. But she was fired and never gained a footing in American films until this one where she dazzles with a Bette Davis-like intensity but with a deceptively demure manner that makes her portrayal surprisingly sympathetic. This is a gem well worth seeking out.",1381622400,,3828,5.735915492957746
388375,4,6301967933,"I saw this movie on a lark as I've been looking at a few old movies lately and one thing I get from these movies that I don't get watching the new technologicaly informed stuff on screen today is that the movies are actually  interesting. They catch your attention, get you hooked. Older movies for all of their seeming cardboard characters and wooden dialogue seem to have a psychological interest that is wanting these days. I couldn't wait for Avatar to end, for all the bombast; wheres I was immediately engaged and captured to the end by Gun Crazy's narrative and the stunning performance by Peggy Cummins. What Dustin Hoffman said about John Wayne's ""Yo"" to his cows, I can apply to Ms. Cummins performance as Annie in Gun Crazy: You believe her! She seemed so off the beam intense.

388376,5,6301967933,"Vaguely inspired by the characters of Bonnie and Clyde, this is a very good, sad and shocking ""film noir"" from 1950. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

Before going further, one important precision: the initial title of this film was ""Deadly is the female"" - and we will see a little bit later why it was a much better title than ""Gun crazy""...

This film tells the story of Barton Tare, a man who always was fascinated by firearms, since his earliest childhood and of Annie-Laurie Starr, the love of his life, a girl who openly admitted that she is ""bad"". She later added ""but I will try to be good"" - but she never intended to try very hard...

Barton Tare is played by John Dall, born as John Jenner Thompson in 1918, a tall, handsome actor who played more in theater and on TV than in movies, albeit he was nominated for an Oscar for his big screen debut ""The corn is green"" in 1945 and was also very much noticed by the critics in Hitchcok's ""Rope"" in 1948. Dall died from heart attack in 1971. He is today mostly remembered by film noir amateurs precisely for his brilliant performance in ""Gun crazy"".

Annie-Laurie Starr is played by Peggy Cummins, born Augusta Margaret Fuller in 1925, a very attractive British actress, who, as a very young starlet was one of bilionnaire's Howard Hughes girlfriends, before dumping him in 1945 for a young war hero, a certain John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who was just beginning a political career. Their affair lasted a couple of years but ended whe her career took off for real in 1947. Even if ""Gun crazy"" was not a box office success, she was very much noticed nevertheless and she kept playing a lot after that. Her greatest role was in the legendary horror ""The night of the demon"" by Jacques Tourneur in 1957 and she is still remembered for this film by cinephiles.

In 1950 she married a wealthy British businessman, Derek Dunnett and had two children with him. In 1961 she retired from acting to take care of her family. She and her husband remained married until his death in 2001. In the Year of Grace 2013 she is still very much with us - and in January 2013, at the occasion of Film Noir City Festival in San Francisco she was honored with a special award for her role in ""Gun crazy"".

I will not say too much about the story told in the film, except for one thing - the title ""Gun crazy"" is a little bit misleading, especially when we begin to watch the film. Barton Tare is certainly a gun fetishist and that from his early childhood - but he is NOT EXACTLY crazy and even if he enjoys target shooting, he certainly never intended to shoot PEOPLE. In fact, until the day he met the woman of his life, he was a slightly odd but ultimately harmless bloke... She on another hand... Well, believe me, there is a reason why this film was initially supposed to have for title ""Deadly is the female""...

There are many reasons why I liked this film, not the least of which is the moral tone it contains - very different and in my opinion much superior to the horribly nihilistic message given much later by the much more known ""Bonnie and Clyde"" film... In this film murder is shown for what it is - an evil thing, which automatically expels the perpetrator from the community. And killing people simply because you do not wish to work is even worse than evil - it is also dirty and ugly...

The ending is very poignant, very shocking, very surprising and very symbolic - and incredibly well filmed!

Bottom line, this is an excellent ""film noir"", to discover absolutely! Enjoy!",1379980800,,3541,4.469040247678018

(MGM, 1950)

Like many postwar film noirs, this may surprise modern viewers expecting a Hollywood reality where emotions and sexuality are airbrushed out of the picture.  The script -- ghost-written by a then-blacklisted Dalton Trumbo -- is a Bonnie & Clyde like story of a gun-happy couple whose multi-state crime spree leads to a grim, inevitable ending. Perhaps the most striking element for me is the anachronistic modernism of lead actor John Dall, a Carradine-like leading man who seems cut from the same cloth as 21st Century actors such as Matt Damon or Mark Walberg, in a performance that stands out in stark contrast to the style of the times (...in a way very similar to Ralph Meeker's performance in ""A Woman In Jeopardy,"" made in the same era.)  John Dall's career never really went anywhere, which is a shame... his few film roles are worth checking out. Playing opposite him was blonde femme fatale Peggy Cummins who eerily reminded me of Kristin Bell (maybe with a smidge of Nicole Kidman?) and while I thought her performance was kind of one-note, her character propels the film: the two of them have good chemistry, and the kinky erotic tension in this film is notable.

Directorially, there are lots of quirky, unusual touches that are a delight for viewers in search of non-cookie cutter storytelling: my favorite scene might be the prelude to a bank heist where the couple have a seemingly mundane conversation, bordering on an old couple bickering with each other, about how to drive through the traffic on Main Street and find the best parking spot. It's a brilliant parody of of domesticity amid a violent tale of deadly consequences. If you like gritty, sexy noir movies, check this one out.

388378,5,6301967933,Pacy version of a tale similar to Bonnie and Clyde .Both good central performances making this one of the top film noirs.,1366329600,,121,4.545454545454546
388379,4,6301967933,"Personally I like my crime noir femme fatales on the kind of good side, not too good but maybe good like Lauren Bacall in To Have or Have Not or The Big Sleep. Or Rita Hayworth when the dust settled in Gilda. No way do I want a dame that I have to watch out over my shoulder on like the same Rita Hayworth in The Lady From Shang-hia or Jane Greer in Out Of The Past. That company is just a little too fast for me. And, no I ain't no Walter Mitty, or no fading, wilting flower but a guy has enough troubles in this world without some frail turning him over, turning him over bad. And no way, no way in hell, do I want some femme fatale, good, bad, or indifference who is kind of trigger-happy. Jesus, no way.  So needless to say I am staying far, far away from Ms. Laurie (played by Peggy Cummins), the twist that has our guy Bart (played by John Dall) all wired up in the film under review, Gun Crazy.

And this is a good place to run the plot line in this little 1949 sleeper of a film. While the dialogue gets thin in spots and it's just a little too didactic in the ""don't play with guns"" department the adventures of this pair and the fast pace they need to travel at makes this an enjoyable one and one half hour see. As you can tell from the film's title and as I have already tipped you to this is about guns, or rather about a pair of young, post-World War II modern alienated youth who have a yearning, a lust, for guns. And each other, make of that what you will. As for Bart the gun thing is more a fascination, a feel good thing . And as for Laurie, well let's just say she has problems, serious problems every time she gets within two feet of a gun, and the slightest smell of danger.

What hold this thing together is that Bart is dizzy, dizzier that he is about guns, for the dame, unlike sensible guys like you and me. Laurie wants to live the high life and in order to do so she needs a guy who can step with her. And shooting the stars out of the rubes in a two-bit back road carnival where she meets up with Bart is not going to do it. So they run away, off-handedly get married (this is 1949 after all), and try their luck at this and that. But like many young footloose couples then, and now, this and that didn't work out. So a little career change was in order, say armed robbery to get a stake together and then on to easy street down in some south of the border lamster village.

But, see, here is where the ""moral"" that drives all of these crime noirs, crime doesn't pay, kicks in, kicks in big time. Crime and guns don't pay for good guys, or bad, or even young footloose couples trying to make a stake, especially when wifey has that loose trigger-finger. So you know without me telling you that this pair, out of luck, on the lam, and friendless can't ever, ever see that white picket fence day just ahead. No way.

Note: Of course 1949 was the heart of the cold war, red scare, commie under every bed, and behind every film, Hollywood Ten before congressional subpoena committees, dark cultural blizzard night. So don't be fooled by the screenplay writer credits. This joint effort had one red scare Hollywood Ten writer, Dalton Trumbo, using that old time devise, the front. Hollywood, this country, and future generations should remember that black time, that dark night when some  vaunted cultural freedoms got short shrift. And remember too a guy name Kirk Douglas who said the hell with all that later and gave Hollywood Ten-types like Trumbo and John Howard Lawson screen credit when he made Spartacus.",1327449600,,3538,4.24962852897474
388380,5,6301967933,"""Deadly is the female"" was the original title of Dalton Trumbo's film noir, and the very adequate starring couple is Peggy Cummins and John Dall.

The woman is the worse killer, but by love, the man follows her into the killings.

Peggy Cummins and John Dall are not what you would call big stars; they look like a fresh-faced couple from the suburbs - until you see them together. They invest their characters with enormous interest and vitality.

388384,5,6301967933,"You think that Truffaut and Godard invented the New Wave? No way; it was invented years before by Joseph Lewis in the sleeper gem Gun Crazy. The difference is that those better-known later filmmakers staged their movies deliberately, while I have read that Lewis came up with the cheap, gritty, intimate style of this movie simply because he lacked the budget to do a typical Hollywood film. And if Godard in particular never saw Gun Crazy, I'll eat my hat.

True, the movie has drawbacks; John Dall's hysterics are a bit overacted sometimes, and the first boring ten minutes could have been simply replaced with an offhand comment later in the film to explain the premise (kid grows up with a pathological attraction to guns, but not to violence) - I suspect that was put in just to head off censors' objections. But Peggy Cummins is simply terrific as the girl your mother REALLY doesn't want you to marry, and the single-cut, continuous shot of a bank robbery - which you never actually see (so add Quentin Tarantino to the list of copycats) is so simple yet tense that it must be one of the greatest scenes in movie history. Use the first ten minutes for snacks and popcorn, and then hang on for the ride.",1296000000,,1209,4.597222222222222
388395,5,6301967933,"I remember reading somewhere that the director of GUN CRAZY suggested an image to the two lead actors (John Dall, Peggy Cummins) in their first scene together: two dogs sniffing each other out. Not polite, perhaps, but apt. You can sense what director Lewis was aiming for, particularly in Cummins' characterization of crack shot & gun moll Annie Lauri. There is definitely a demonic element in her character; it's like her beautiful face hides a devil you can only see in her eyes. Both leads are text book sociopaths, but Annie Laurie pushes it up one notch. Yes, she is without a doubt, a certifiable homicidal psychopath--and this is one reason why she & the film are so much fun to watch.

NOTE 8/15/10: I watched the movie again & need to make a correction. The male character is not exactly a sociopath. He's an orphan raised by a sister who has to work all the time. He IS obsessed with guns, but he is not really violent or cruel (to animals, we discover). However, fire arms are more important to him than human relationships--for the exception of the girl, whose Annie Oakley routine seems to fulfill ALL his desires.

This is a earlier version of the Bonnie & Clyde story--and much more authentic (believable) than Faye Dunaway & Warren Beatty in those roles. Like Dunaway & Beatty, Dall & Cummins are extremly good-looaking, but they are not under pressure to flawlessly attractive. In other words, the director encouraged them to let it all hang out. He was a master of the low-budget, film noir--and this is one of his true masterpieces. Dall's character is easier to feel empathy toward--and even Annie Laurie (a real anti-herione of film noir) causes some identification...the secret anti-social within?

At the time of the movie's initial release, the brilliant screenwriter Talton Trumbo wasn't able to take credit for the picture because he had been blacklisted as one of 'The Holywood 10.'

GUN CRAZY wasn't exactly a big hit at the box office, but it continues to draw admirers. It is a MUST for film noir fans.

I give 5 STARS to those pair of Krazy Kids.

388396,5,6301967933,"""Laurie, no matter what happens, I wouldn't have it any other way."" -- Bart

Joseph H. Lewis cemented his place in film history with this intoxicating and electrically charged film noir about two people who never should have met, simply because they go together like guns and ammo; neither any good at all without the other. Known for ""B"" films like The Invisible Ghost and The Falcon in San Francisco, director Lewis showed he could do much more with the right material. Deadly is the Female was originally slated for Monogram release, a Poverty Row studio. The decision by producers Maurice and Frank King to let United Artists distribute Gun Crazy instead, afforded it the wider audience it deserved. Today, it is heralded as a noir classic, a mesmerizing crime thriller both romantic and tragic, with plenty of raw tensions. Blacklisted Dalton Trumbo worked on the screenplay with MacKinlay Kantor under the pseudonym Millard Kaufman. Kantor's Saturday Evening Post story became a charged and fast moving crime drama thanks to some tinkering with the story, and the wonderful performances by John Dall and Peggy Cummins as the doomed couple.

Victor Young was pegged to score this film, and while his romantic leanings and trademark use of violins would on the surface not lend itself to such a raw story, it proved another wise decision. Young imbues the romance between Bart (Dall) and Laurie (Cummins) with unexpected tenderness, creating depth to their love. It acts as stark contrast to the couple's twisted desire, especially that of Laurie, which leads them on a roller-coaster ride of crime with no way off. It also serves to soften viewer's hearts about the crime spree, eliciting sympathy from the viewer even as Laurie gets off more and more the closer they get to raw violence. Bart's obsessions with guns is feeding off Laurie's growing excitement. For Bart, she is the ultimate weapon; sexy, sleek, inviting, and full of trouble when you open the chamber for a closer look. Viewers will find themselves rooting for them to make it to Mexico and elude the manhunt even though they know they shouldn't.

Bart Tare has been obsessed with guns since he was a young boy, which leads to him being taken from his sister and sent to reform school. A good kid at heart, unwilling to kill any living thing, his obsession with guns leads to Army life, then back home. It is there he meets and finds something as sleek and intoxicating as the barrel of a gun, in slinky Annie Laurie Starr. She's a carnival sharpshooter and when he goes her one better, you can almost see the tingles flowing through her body and feel the fires being flamed by guns. He doesn't know yet that as they fall in love, their fate is sealed. Cummins is terrific as the girl trying to fight her urges and be good like Bart for as long as she can. A romantic atmosphere is set by Victor Young's score, and scenes of the couple's honeymoon upon leaving the carnival hang over the film in 'what could have been' fashion. Bart doesn't know she killed a man in St. Louis, so has a taste for guns which goes far beyond his.

Romantic and twisted, you can't help liking Laurie, as there is something tragic about her character. Bart, who can't shake her because she arouses feelings not even a gun in his hand can give him, is soon one half of a robbery team. Slick and successful, planning things so no one gets hurt, they make there way across several state lines. But when one holdup almost goes sour, we see in Laurie's eyes, as she looks back, the thrill she's discovered which will be their end. Stuck in a snowdrift in Montana, they both confess to being tired of the life, and plan one last job before heading to Mexico. Laurie has the fever for violence now, however, and Bart has the fever for her. The FBI has the fever to catch them, and once there is nowhere else to go, he heads back home. What follows is noir poetry, written with lead and lust, and thanks to Victor Young, love as well. A brilliant staging of cameras during a robbery, all gotten in one long take, always gets mentioned, yet, just as important are those scenes of romance during the couple's honeymoon. Those who say noir isn't romantic haven't watched much noir. It is these scenes which make the story important, and tragic.

Beautifully shot, scored, and acted, this is one of the finest examples of noir done right. Dall is very good, and Cummins is even better, making us understand why Dall doesn't break free. A ""B"" masterpiece, and a must see for noir fans.",1278460800,3,4523,4.655819774718398

388398,4,6301967933,"Note: This review contains SPOILERS. ""Gun Crazy"" begins with an extended prologue that sets up young Bart (Russ Tamblyn) as a budding sociopath obsessed with guns, though not with killing. It shows Bart's small town community attempting to struggle with what to do about the troubled young boy. While Bart's sister and best friends testify on his behalf, the judge, unconvinced of his harmlessness, sentences him to reform school. A few years later, adult Bart (played by John Dall) having matriculated through reform school and the military, returns to his home town. His best friends take him to a carnival to celebrate. There, Bart is immediately smitten by the female sharpshooter, Annie Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins).

From the first moment Cummins, a beautiful girl with strangely off-center, dead eyes, appears on camera, I thought, ""She's a psychopath."" Her first action is to fire her guns directly at Bart. (The guns are loaded with blanks.) This certainly foreshadows the deadly effect she is destined to have on Bart. Bart joins the carnival, and the two of them soon run off to get married (though Annie Laurie's boss, hinting at her responsbility for a murder, attempts to use blackmail to prevent her going).

There follows a sequence showing the young lovers honeymooning and then gambling away their small savings. During this ""middle sequence"" Annie Laurie, who has vowed to ""attempt to be good"" even looks softer and more feminine, less crazed. But, as soon as the money runs out she begins to pressure Bart to commit armed robbery. Bart's scruples can not ultimately compete with his lust for Annie Laurie, and he agrees, though he never shoots any of their victims. In the final portion of the film, Annie Laurie's full-blown psychosis emerges. She begins to shoot their victims, claiming to Bart that she is afraid, while the more natural conclusion is that she kills for the thrill of it. In the film's startling climax, Bart finally uses his gun to kill.

This film is a classic noir which shows, not doomed love, but the inevitable result of really bad choices. To me, it is an exploration of the psychology of the sociopath, running the gamut from the sympathetic Bart to the monstrous, yet somehow pathetically touching, Annie Laurie Starr.",1256601600,2,2266,4.98941798941799

By the end of the story he's a sweaty, nervous wreck being hunted down like a rabid animal. It's ruthlessly beautiful--like watching a leopard take down a gazelle.

John Dall and Peggy Cummins make one of the more interesting male-female pairings I've ever seen on film. Cummins is one of the prettiest women I've seen from the noir era and fascinating to view throughout this movie. I'm sorry her other films aren't on video. She didn't do many movies in the U.S.

The character Dall plays is good, too, although in the end his constant whining over the predicament he got into gets a little annoying. He plays the nice guy who is led astray by the bad woman.

Also appearing is Berry Kroeger (Blood Alley), Morris Carnovsky (Joe Palooka in the Knockout), Anabel Shaw (Shock), Harry Lewis (Key Largo), Nedrick Young (Seconds), and a young Russ Tamblyn (Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, High School Confidential!), probably best known for his role as `Riff', hot tempered leader of the Jets, from the musical West Side Story (1961)...remember, `When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way! From you first cigarette your last dyin' days'.

As the film begins we see a young boy, played by Tamblyn, named Bart Tare, who's in a whole heap of trouble.  Seems Bart really isn't a bad seed, but his undeniable desire towards firearms in general has gotten him into some hot water enough times he's eventually sent to reform school despite pleas from his sister Ruby (Shaw), who also happens to be his guardian.  As the years pass, an adult Bart, now played by Dall, is eventually released and enlists in the army (as good a place as any to satiate one's desire to be around guns), to which he returns home once his stint is up.  Bart and his childhood friends celebrate his homecoming by going to a traveling carnival where they witness the sharp-shooting skills of one Annie Laurie Starr (Cummins), whom Bart immediately finds himself drawn to, her six-shooters singing a siren call he can't resist.  Demonstrating his own formidable skills as a marksman, Bart ends up joining the carnival, although he and Annie soon leave after a falling out with their boss (What?!  And give up the life of a carny?  That's just plain nuts).  Young, unencumbered with responsibilities, and armed with pistols, the pair ties the knot, quickly blowing through whatever dough they have in an orgiastic spending jag, and soon find themselves light in the pockets, so to speak.  Bart's content to eek out a living on a menial wage with a real job, as long as he's got Annie, but she desires a life full of thrills, action, and lots of moola, enough of each for her to suggest to Bart that they use their talents to take what they need (Annie is most definitely a bad seed).  Bart reluctantly goes along (the sap), and the pair begins a life of crime, one that starts out small time but eventually expands as whatever dough they manage to steal is quickly used up to maintain the extravagant lifestyle Annie desires.  Eventually the stress of being a nogoodnik wears on Bart, enough so he pleads with Annie that they should go straight, but she convinces him to pull one, last score, one that will give them the funds they need to start a new life down old Mexico way...the heist is a success, but things sour during the getaway, and now they're pursued by both local, state, and federal authorities, all with orders to `shoot to kill'...

This is a great film, worth watching if only for the scene involving the first time Bart and Annie hold up a bank, clad in the western gear worn during their stint in the carnival.  The long, continuous shot involves one camera, positioned in the back seat of their car, and shows the jacked up couple on their way to the bank, trying to find a place to park, Bart entering the bank, while Annie stays behind.  The camera never leaves the back seat, giving the viewer the feeling that they're sort of in on the holdup (from the standpoint of being in the backseat of the getaway car), sharing all the excitement and the danger.  There's a number of similarly interesting shots throughout the film, which goes a long way towards really keeping things lively and the overall pacing in high gear.  An interesting thing, when I first saw John Dall on the screen, he looked so familiar to me, but for the life of me I couldn't recall what I'd seen him in before until I reviewed his credits and saw he was one of the principal players in Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 feature Rope.  Both he and Ms. Cummins create quite a lot of heat here, portraying a young, passionate, impetuous pair on the razor's edge, he a lovelorn sap willing to follow his heart despite better judgment, eventually realizing his folly but also realizing he can't turn back, and she a manipulative, materialistic, type who not only knows exactly what she wants but also what she is, and makes no apologies for either...which is worse, she who has little pretense (anyone who spends five minutes with this dame will know she's trouble), or he, who struggles continually with his conscience, generally always siding with his heart over his brain?  Seeing as how they both had some obviously bad wiring, it's a matter of six of one, half dozen of the other, if you ask me.  What's funny is there was at least one who tried to warn Bart off on Annie, a fellow performer by the name of Bluey-Bluey, whom Bart shared quarters with during his stint with the carnival.  In Bart's defense I suppose it's kind of difficult to take advice from a guy in greasy clown makeup who goes by the name Bluey-Bluey.  Another aspect that really stood out for me was the ending...it becomes fairly obvious how things will go in a general sense, but the story actually manages to squeeze in a delicious, unexpected twist in terms of the specifics.  To say any more would spoil it (I'll give you a hint, it does involve guns...I know, I know, not much of a hint considering the film is titled Gun Crazy), but know that's it's a real hoot and a half, one worth hanging on for...all in all this is a tight, engaging film, well directed film with some really interesting characters, strong performances, and decent production values, one worth checking out if you enjoy sexually charged noir crime dramas from back in the day.

The picture, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), looks very good, limited to a few, very minor flaws, and the Dolby Digital audio is sharp and clean.  There is a commentary track featuring author/film noir specialist Glenn Erickson, along with subtitles in English, Spanish, and French.  If you're interested in picking up this DVD, you might want to look into purchasing the Film Noir Classics Collection, Volume 1, a most excellent DVD set, as it includes this film, along with The Asphalt Jungle (1950), Murder My Sweet (1944), Out of the Past (1947), and The Set-Up (1949) at a cost which is significantly less than buying the features individually, at least at the time this review was written.

388436,5,6301967933,"Peggy Cummins and John Dall star in this stirring film noir crime drama which was a precursor to the film classic ""Bonnie and Clyde""

Dall stars as Bart Tare who throughout his life has always had a proclivity for firearms and shooting.  After a four year stint in reform school due to the burglary of a pistol, he serves time in the military.  He heads back home after his discharge and goes with his best friends Clyde and Dave to the local carnival.  It is there he meets up with sharpshooter and performer Annie Laurie Starr played by Cummins.  The unemployed Dall acquires a position in the carnival.

They fall for each other and soon get fired by the jealous carnival owner and commence a crime wave inspired by the aberrant Cummins.  She's a high rolling English girl who loves money and excitement and influences the malleable and lovesick Dall into a life of crime.  Dall's lack of a killer instinct makes him a reluctant robber however his love for the lethal Cummins sucks him in deeper and deeper.

On the lam after a number of petty ante stickups they agreed to pull one last job and get out.  The plan a robbery of the payroll of a large meat packing plant where they've both secured jobs. Unfortunately trhe trigger happy Cummins kills two employees in the course of their escape.

The doomed couple is now the focus of a nationwide manhunt that ultimately results in just retribution for their crimes.

""Gun Crazy"" is a taut thriller that creatively uses the psychological profiles of the main players to formulate a plot revealing how negative influences can result in criminal behavior.

388439,4,6301967933,"This review is for the 2004 Warner Brothers DVD.

The story starts with a teenage boy named Bart who is obsessed with guns.  He's so obsessed that he has to steal one and gets caught and goes to reform school for four years.  After finishing school he does four years in the army as a shooting instructor and then finally comes back to his hometown and sees his old friends.  Bart (adult character played by John Dall) then goes with his friends to a carnival and sees a shooting exhibition by an attractive young blonde woman named Annie Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins).  He beats her in a shooting contest and then joins the act.  From that point on, it sets the stage for strange romance, plus some action and adventure with the gun-happy couple.

This DVD was one of five DVD released by Warner Brothers in the Film Noir Classics Collection Volume 1.  Unlike the four others, the acting and script seemed second rate compared to the other four.  The main character Bart, didn't seem very convincing in his role.  Also, the movie has the feel of one of those teen explotation movies from the 1950's preaching the evils of firearm use rather than a dark, crime film.  But overall, the movie is still very watchable and at times quite entertaining.

The DVD picture quality was terrific.  It was very rare to see a spec of film deterioration anywhere in the movie.  The sound was satisfactory.  The only bonus is commentary by Glenn Erickson.

PLEASE NOTE:  Before buying this DVD, consider buying the Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 1 which contains this movie plus four other highly recommended movies at a very reasonable price.

388440,4,6301967933,"Sigmund Freud would have a field day with Bart Tare (John Dall), the gun crazy marksman who just can't live without always having a firearm in his possession. Feeling more than a little inadequate, shall we say, Bart soon teams up with Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins) a woman he meets at a carnival for who the moniker - girls gone wild - must have been invented. Basically, Laurie's pure poison, a sugar coated heartless killer consumed by her obsession to be rich. Naturally, the chemistry between these two ne'er-do-wells is immediate and deadly; Laurie's high life fueling both their rabid passions for each other and a life of crime. In ""Gun Crazy"" Bart is a pre-teen reprobate who, after a stint in reform school and the army, returns home without much concern or interest in anything other than a life of crime. It isn't that Bart goes looking for trouble - only that the excitement of getting into some is very compelling. The film is one of those cautionary tales that attempts to chart what happens to individuals to whom life does not follow the straight and narrow trajectory. Gun Crazy is a superb example of the must-see, raw B-flick. It sparkles with sordid raunchy performances that, quite frankly, are refreshing in light of the usual antiseptic film output one has come to expect from ""the golden age"" of Hollywood.
In keeping with Warner's current trend to not really do all that is required to completely remaster classic movies for DVD, this film is just average. The gray scale is nicely balanced with deep solid blacks but the whites are not very clean. There's a considerable amount of film grain and a lot of age related artifacts for a visual presentation that, while a considerable improvement over previously issued VHS tapes, is still below par for what might have been if more digital wizardry had been applied. The audio is mono but nicely balanced. The more intent listener will notice slight pops and some hiss but nothing that will distract. There's a fairly interesting audio commentary by Glenn Erickson that will most surely enhance your appreciation for this film. All in all, a good disc to add to your library of classic cinema.",1109980800,4,2165,4.806970509383378
388441,5,6301967933,"""Gun Crazy"" was hailed by Paul Schrader as one of the ""best and characteristically noir films"" in his essential 1972 essay ""Notes on Film Noir"". ""Gun Crazy"" was based on a short story by MacKinlay Kantor and adapted for the screen by Kantor and Dalton Trumbo. Bart Tare (John Dall) has been oddly obsessed with guns since childhood, as if his very identity depended upon possessing and shooting them. But he is ironically repulsed by killing and wouldn't dream of shooting any living thing. His fetish nevertheless gets him sent to reform school when he steals a pistol as a teenager. Years later, just out of the army and back in his hometown, Bart visits the carnival with his boyhood friends, where he sees a gunslinging act by sharpshooting Annie Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins). Bart is smitten and gives up a prospective job with a gun company to join the carnival and be with Laurie. Fired by the carnival's owner who won't be upstaged by Laurie's new love interest, Bart and Laurie try their luck at married life together. But when the money gets tight, ambitious, manipulative Laurie coaxes a reluctant Bart into a life of crime.

""Gun Crazy"" expresses one of the most blatant equations of sex and violence in the classic noir canon. And Laurie is fittingly among noir's greatest femme fatale killers. Indeed, the matter-of-fact alternate title under which the film was first released was ""Deadly Is the Female"". Two fundamental dilemma's propel the characters actions: The longstanding conflict between Bart's love for guns and his inability to kill, in which his reluctance is ironically a sort of dysfunction. And Bart and Laurie's completely irrational relationship that they cling to with self-destructive fervor. Director Joseph H. Lewis explores how the characters' relationship is somehow fulfilled in the crimes that bind them. In some of the film's most interesting scenes, we observe Bart and Laurie's odd mutual dependency by eavesdropping as they prepare their criminal adventures by means of a camera placed in the back seat of their car. Although we are looking at the back of their heads, the technique is most effective. ""Gun Crazy"" is sometimes thought of as a precursor to 1967's ""Bonnie and Clyde"". It undoubtedly influenced that film, but ""Gun Crazy"" is quintessential film noir and a classic in its own right. MacKinlay Kantor's story, upon which the film was based, was inspired by the real exploits of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. And ""Gun Crazy"" in turn influenced Arthur Penn's 1967 film, bringing the legend full circle.

The DVD: There is a good audio commentary by film critic Glenn Erikson. It is a fairly academic appraisal of the film, packed with information about characters, story, themes, and a great deal about even the minor actors. Erikson also provides some shot-by-shot analysis and compares the film to Kantor's short story. Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish.",1108080000,5,2945,5.032786885245901
388442,5,6301967933,"If this film were to be released in today's society, it would not be looked upon with the greatest of ease.  Mothers, victims, and Michael Moore would talk about this film as being a perfect reason why guns are a problem in our society.  It would be similar to making a sequel to Natural Born Killers and hoping that it sweeps the Oscars.  It just wouldn't happen.  Yet, in 1949 this film worked.  With a growing interest in firearms began building, the studio that released this film decided it would take a chance and release this little ditty co-staring John Dall and Peggy Cummins while the main name in lights at the marquee is ""GUNS"".  Throughout the film, director Joseph Lewis tries to demonstrate to us that ""guns don't kill people, people kill people"" by having us follow these two hapless victims lead by destruction by the forceful fist of the gun.

Through powerful imagery, detailed character studies, and creative direction, Deadly is the Female proves that it is more than just a simple black and white film about the evil of weapons.  Dall and Cummins are perfectly matched as the mismatched bandits on the run from the law.  Dall built such a strong character from the start to the finish of this film that I honestly forgot that I was watching a movie.  His inability to kill coupled with Cummins disrespect of life provided some of the best dialogue, interaction, and intensity that I have ever seen in a film.  I could watch these two characters in anything and I would still be entranced.  The fire in their eyes, the passion in their voices, and the eventual crumbling of their own selves was vividly beautiful.  I am not ashamed to say that the acting in this film could easily be put next to the work of those high paid in Hollywood today and be seen as the same (or better).  There is something about these two that forces us to look deeper into them.  From the beginning we settle in with our connection and never let go of our two characters.  We watch everything they do with a close eye and cheering whenever they escape from the law.  While the ""gun"" is the main character, the two wielding the weapon take the film to a new level.

One can only speak of the acting so much before you have to bring in the direction from Lewis and the cinematography that only give the actors room to showcase their talent.  Lewis' direction is immaculate.  His attention to detail and scene set up is one of the best I have ever witnessed.  The scene that comes immediately to mind is early in the film when the friends are telling their story to the judge about how Bart couldn't kill the mountain lion.  When he refuses and his friends try to shoot, the only camera angle we have is of the boys shooting with Bart's fist in the frame.  His fist clenches everytime the gun is shot.  This was amazing how well this built Bart's character for the rest of the film.  Lewis knows this film.  You can see it with every shot that he takes.  He is excited and mesmerized by the characters, which translates onto the film perfectly.  He takes his passion and pushes it towards the cinematography as well.  There are several shots of our two ""love-birds"" driving the car to their next heist.  Lewis builds so much intensity in those little spaces that it lingers throughout the rest of the film.  The Savings and Loan Building heist is what immediately comes to my mind.  When the two are searching for a parking space to rob the institution you just get this feel of humanity and nervousness.  It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.

So, we have the top-notch acting, the intricate and detailed direction followed by a simple, yet effective story.  Love plays second fiddle to the gun as we see a story that is not unlike ones that we currently see invading our multiplex.  I think for me it was exciting to just see the era that this movie was filmed.  Another reviewer mentioned the scenes of the gun in the window of a store and the one-man police station on the California border was hysterical and somewhat eerie as well.  I couldn't agree more.  While this may have been exaggerated at the time, it still provided a pleasing look as to where we have progressed to since then (and maybe because of this film!).

Overall, this film really impressed me.  I am a fan of films made in the 40s, and Deadly is the Female is no exception.  This era of film continually breaks new boundaries for me and proves that Hollywood may not be as creative as we think.  I see these films made in the 40s, and see the exact same types of stories in today's movie theaters.  Is there plagiarism happening or is Hollywood just recycling to continue to allure audiences to dish out more money?  The world may never know, but what I do know is that if you ever have the chance to see Deadly is the Female, I suggest it.  Powerful, stunning, and beautifully captured onto film, it will not disappoint.  Enjoy.

388473,2,6301967933,"I got Gun Crazy as part of the recently released Noir Classic Collection.  It was the one title in that collection I was unfamiliar with, so I watched it first.  After viewing it, I'm very so-so on the film.  Gun Crazy is one of those ""influential"" flicks, that supposedly inspired movies such as Bonnie and Clyde, and Badlands.  That of course begs the question, why wouldn't the real life stories of Bonnie and Clyde, or Charles Starkweather, have inspired directors independently of Gun Crazy?

The movie itself is pretty tame stuff by today's standards, and plays a lot like a Bowery Boys episode (it's impossible to think of Dall as truly bad).  The opening scene of vandalism by the young Barton Tare (played later in the film by John Dall), is done well.  Also good, is our introduction to Annie Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins), who stars in a carnival show.  This scene is pure noir - Lady Death in a cowboy hat!  The movie has a number of finely framed scenes - usually of characters, face shots (the transfer is superb).  Particularly good are face close-ups from below the steering wheel during a chase scene. Interesting, and in a way that has you recalling Welles' camera work.  And the ending in the swamp is excellent. But that's about it (it's no High Sierra), fragments here and there, that nevertheless leave you scratching your head over the supposed importance of this film.

388475,5,6301967933,"One of the all-time great films noir and a bona fide cult classic, ""Gun Crazy"" is one of the handful of cinematic gems chosen for inclusion in the United States National Film Registry. The story revolves around a sexually repressed young man who has grown up obsessed with the power of guns; one fine day he meets up with a sexy blonde carnival sharpshooter and the rest, as they say, is history. Soon the two lovers are trapped in a vortex of greed, desire, violence, and murder which quickly proceeds to spin out of control before it finally ends viciously one dawn in a fog-shrouded swamp. A minor masterpiece featuring a smouldering performance by British actress Peggy Cummins (who, in 1947, had been replaced in the title role of Fox's ""Forever Amber"" due to her perceived lack of sex appeal) as the brutal femme fatale, and a career-defining one by former Oscar nominee John Dall (Best Supporting Actor 1945 for ""The Corn Is Green"") as her fresh-faced-but-deadly cohort. Tightly directed by Joseph H. Lewis, the film is enriched by Victor Young's moody score and Russell Harlan's exquisite black and white cinematography.

 At a carnival, he meets a hot female trick shooter named Annie Laurie Starr, played by Peggy Cummins.

 After beating her in a shooting contest, Bart joins the carnival. After her jealous manager fires both of them, Annie and Bart get married and go on a crime spree.

 All of this is well-directed by Joseph L. Lewis, especially the shots of Annie in the getaway car when the couple is in the process of robbing a bank. I especially liked the way he has Ms. Cummins talk out loud in these scenes when nobody else is in the car. It's a great way to show the tension and anxiety about what she's doing.

 There's real sexual sparks between these characters that fly off the screen and carry the movie.

388477,5,6301967933,"Over the years, I had seen the striking, lurid poster for ""Gun Crazy"" in various film books ( nicely rendered on the DVD cover ), but I had never actually seen the movie. Well, the movie knocked me out ! This has to be one of the greatest ""B"" movies of all time. It was also briefly titled ""Deadly is the Female"", very ""film noirish"" and appropriate.
 I will not reveal too many details about the plot--other reviewers have covered it extensively ( perhaps in some cases too extensively ). Bart Tare ( John Dall ) has had a passion for guns his whole life. At a carnival, he meets a sideshow sharpshooter from London, Annie Laurie Starr ( Peggy Cummins ). They are soon sharing not only a passion for guns, but an intense passion for each other ! Falling under the spell of this charismatic, young blonde--who craves excitement, action and the finer things in life--Bart is drawn into a cross-country crime spree that escalates from robbery to murder.
As one of the best ""femme fatale"" types in film history, Peggy Cummins gives a rivetting performance. You can't take your eyes off her, as she fanatically plunges down a road from which there is no return, taking the man she loves with her. Her character steals money--Ms. Cummins steals the movie ! As Bart, John Dall is rather stoic and one-dimensional until later in the film, when he realizes the harm he is causing others, including those who were close friends. His performance really picks up in the later scenes. Incidentally, Bart as a youth is played by Russ Tamblyn, later to spark a number of movies with his dancing and acrobatic skills.
The other ""star"" here is the Director, Joseph H. Lewis. His approach is refreshing and innovative. I particularly liked the scenes where you--the audience--are in the back seat of the getaway car during a heist. You cannot help but wonder how much later films like ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Badlands"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" were influenced by this low-budget masterpiece ?
I also liked the way that Lewis depicts the sexual overtones of his characters and situations, remembering that this film was first released in 1949.
Concerning the picture quality of the DVD, I see that one reviewer had some problems with the image. Personally, I found the black and white picture to be crisp and clear, especially for a film now 55 years old. The optional comments of author/film buff, Glenn Erickson, are a very nice bonus.
""Gun Crazy"" provides further proof that, whether it's the 1940s or 2004, you don't need big budgets and ""superstars"" to make a memorable film.

388479,5,6301967933,"After a rocky young life of no parents, reform school and a stint in the army, Bart (John Dahl)---who's had a lifelong obsession with guns---meets sexy sideshow sharpshooter Annie Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins) and joins her in the show. When she rejects her boss's drunken advances, he fires them both. Bart and Laurie are in love and take off together. But they both love something else too. He loves guns and firing them (but won't kill anything) and she loves the thrill of guns and crime and won't hesitate to kill. Pretty soon they're on the road holding up anything and everything. Bart has mixed emotions about their exploits but Laurie loves it and urges him on and on. Like Claire Trevor's character in ""Born to Kill"", Laurie is turned on by violence. It excites her. Bart loves Laurie but doesn't understand why she kills. However he's in it for the long haul because he can't live without her nor she him. ""Gun Crazy"" was done on a low budget but director Joseph H.Lewis did wonders in keeping the film exciting and on the move like Laurie and Bart. Claustrophobic camera angles make you feel like you're riding in the back seat with them and extreme close-ups let you look in their eyes. The music score is excellent with a hint of romantic nuances from songs they've listened to that provides the sympathetic tinges you feel as they're on the run or hiding out in the swamps. The final scene where they're surrounded by fog and the law is closing in stays in you're memory. Cummins is astonishing as Laurie and Dahl is good as Bart. The film does have (as the box says) an amazing contemporary feel to it. Some scenes are so naturalistic they seem improvised for realism. The DVD print is absolutely clear and gorgeous which makes enjoying this dynamic film all the more a pleasure. ""Gun Crazy"" has a deserved cult status among noir connoiseurs and you can see why. It's an excellent crime film and character study. A keeper.",1089158400,3,1937,4.633720930232558
388480,4,6301967933,"Sigmund Freud would have a field day with Bart Tare (John Dall), the gun crazy marksman who just can't live without always having a firearm in his possession. Feeling more than a little inadequate, shall we say, Bart soon teams up with Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins) a woman he meets at a carnival for who the moniker - girls gone wild - must have been invented. Basically, Laurie's pure poison, a sugar coated heartless killer consumed by her obsession to be rich. Naturally, the chemistry between these two ne'er-do-wells is immediate and deadly; Laurie's high life fueling both their rabid passions for each other and a life of crime. In ""Gun Crazy"" Bart is a pre-teen reprobate who, after a stint in reform school and the army, returns home without much concern or interest in anything other than a life of crime. It isn't that Bart goes looking for trouble - only that the excitement of getting into some is very compelling.  The film is one of those cautionary tales that attempts to chart what happens to individuals to whom life does not follow the straight and narrow trajectory. Gun Crazy is a superb example of the must-see, raw B-flick. It sparkles with sordid raunchy performances that, quite frankly, are refreshing in light of the usual antiseptic film output one has come to expect from ""the golden age"" of Hollywood.
In keeping with Warner's current trend to not really do all that is required to completely remaster classic movies for DVD, this film is just average. The gray scale is nicely balanced with deep solid blacks but the whites are not very clean. There's a considerable amount of film grain and a lot of age related artifacts for a visual presentation that, while a considerable improvement over previously issued VHS tapes, is still below par for what might have been if more digital wizardry had been applied.  The audio is mono but nicely balanced. The more intent listener will notice slight pops and some hiss but nothing that will distract.  There's a fairly interesting audio commentary by Glenn Erickson that will most surely enhance your appreciation for this film.  All in all, a good disc to add to your library of classic cinema.",1089072000,2,2169,4.806970509383378
388481,5,6301967933,"This movie is about a hopeless couple's lust: lust for guns, lust for each other, but most of all lust to make a family.
Their names evoke the old west.  Annie Laurie Starr is a sharpshooter, a cross between Annie Oakley and Belle Starr.  She and Bart Tare, the weaker of the two, barely make one complete person.
Bart grew up without parents, raised by his older sister.  She did the best she could, but as a judge sentencing young Bart for stealing a gun tells her, she can't continue to raise her brother after she gets married.  Starting her own family will be hard enough and that's her most important job.  Again Bart misses out on a family and is sent to reform school.
Gun-crazy Bart (who just got out of the army as a shooting instructor) meets his dreamgirl Laurie in a traveling sideshow conning rubes for money.  When Bart joins the act he and Laurie are already committing fraud every night, so they're criminals even before they run away from the circus to start robbing banks and gas stations.  They wear their cowboy costumes on their crime spree.  Still kids, they're playing dress-up and playing house together.
For their final score, they both get jobs in a meat-packing plant - -  Bart a man's job driving a truck, and Laurie in the office where she's reprimanded for wearing slacks instead a skirt.  Pants are easier to run and shoot in after stealing the money in the company safe, but they also show Laurie doesn't know her proper role.
The insane irony is that it never occurs to Bart and Laurie that in setting up this robbery they've made a normal life together like people with regular jobs and real families.  As the clock ticks down you want to scream at them to stop.  But they don't see it.  After the robbery, they go to another amusement park like kids who want one more ride.
The most disturbing image in the film is when Bart and Laurie hide out in Bart's sister's house.  Her children are there and when Bart and Laurie are ready to leave, Laurie picks up Bart's sister's baby to take with them on their escape.  It's Laurie's last desperate attempt to make a family with Bart, but he takes the baby from her and puts it down.  By now Bart realizes he and Laurie aren't like other people.
But there's something in Bart you admire when he tells Laurie that he wouldn't have had it any other way.  There's something in most of us that wants to be free like Bart and Laurie.",1084752000,,2407,4.446469248291572

7818070,5,6301967933,"Noir as a genre is based literally on the predominant use of darkness and shadow in a film and Gun Crazy has that in spades. And even in brightly lit sequences there's often an air of claustrophobia and menace (rear seat point of view shots and a chase through a warehouse of hanging carcasses, for instance). Being a Hayes era film, one knows how the story must end, but who cares if that's predictable when getting there is all the fun? For me, it's the camera work that makes Gun Crazy so captivating. One can skip through this and pull single frames at random and 9 times out of 10 they'll be exceptional individual photographs. It's not a perfect film--the childhood buddies angle seems a bit forced and those performances are relatively weak--but there's so much to like about Gun Crazy--the look, the editing, the framing, the acting, the dialogue (hats off to uncredited scriptwriter Dalton Trumbo). One gets the feeling this hip and stylish movie was a big influence on Quentin Tarrantino. Peggy Cummins does pretty much steal the show as a carnival sharpshooter with a taste for furs and jewelry, but John Dall's everyman qualities add more depth to his conflicted character than if it had been portrayed by a more commonplace Hollywood hunk. A superior and essential film noir, how did I not know about it until now? Might pair nicely with Night of the Hunter--a different kind of chase film which is likewise a visual delight.",1518998400,,1438,4.756

7818074,4,6301967933,"""Gun Crazy"" might be the best ""B"" movie ever made.  To anyone who grew up in the 1950's, it will have a special resonance.  The two leads, John Dall (""Bart"")  and Peggy Cummins (""Annie""), essentially form an inverted version of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans--- the archetypal television cowboy couple.  Bart is so squeaky-clean and soft-spoken, like ""Mr. Rogers"", and Peggy Cummins is a spitfire who radiates sex appeal, suggesting beneath the tame cowboy romances that Hollywood manufactured, there was a lot of repressed lust.  In ""Gun Crazy"", it comes to the surface.

The story doesn't make a lot of sense, but it makes up for it with manic energy.  Essentially Bart and Annie are people with talents that society cannot put to use.  They have the choice of being a carnival act, or outlaws.  So, they choose the latter.  When ""Annie"" isn't wearing a cowboy hat, she's got an artist's beret on her head.  You figure it out.

Dalton Trumbo wrote the script.  The camera work is very interesting throughout the movie, and the musical score keeps doubling back to an obsessive three note love theme.  Viewers will quickly pick up on the fact that the couple is doomed, but that doesn't seem to matter.  It only matters that they have style.... and that's why the movie draws comparisons to ""Bonnie and Clyde"".  It all ends up in the mountains of Southern California, though the terrain looks more like the Scottish moors, awash in fog.

Peggy Cummins surfaced later in another memorable B film, ""Curse of the Demon"", with Dana Andrews.",1500249600,,1532,4.786259541984733
7818075,2,6301967933,"Movie buffs seem to universally love this movie.  To them it is ground breaking.
For me, as a gun owner and avid target shooter, I have a different take.  To me, this movie is just another Hollywood gun exploitation flick with nothing but negative insinuations about gun ownership.

Bart Tare is a good boy, maybe a bit misguided because he has no father in his home, but then he develops an interest in guns.  This quickly becomes an unhealthy obsession.  And even though he has no desire to harm any living thing with a gun, the die is cast; there is no going back.  Inevitably he runs afoul of the law, does a stint in reform school and after being discharged from the army he immediately falls in with the wrong crowd (""Reefer Madness"" anyone?).  It is a psychopathic woman (of course) who leads him into a life of crime that includes murder and mayhem.  And even though he remains essentially non-violent in nature, he is none-the-less deeply complicit in terrible crimes.
Naturally, it all ends tragically.

What a load of exploitative baloney.

The King brothers were notorious for producing films with essentially zero artistic merit.  For them, movie making was a racket.  Gun Crazy is an excellent example.",1500249600,,1216,4.76555023923445
