8581407,5,B00101JN92,"I can attest , first hand  to the accuracy and quality of content of this video, which is topped off with the emotinal ending. It is a must see video !  I was in the D Day  invasion landing troops from the Navy USS LCI 492 onto the Omaha Beach  on D DAy.  This  DVD is the story of US Coast Guard Flotilla 10 of which the the LCI 492 was a part. Also recommended highly is the DVD entitled "" D Day  in Memory of the Fallen"" on the same subject.",1395014400,,444,3.760869565217391
