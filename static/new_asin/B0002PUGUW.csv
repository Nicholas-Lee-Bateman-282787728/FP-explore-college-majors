2113074,5,B0002PUGUW,"Scott Bakula turns in a bravura performance in ""Role of a Lifetime."" The range of characters he demonstrates is reminiscent of his days in ""Quantum Leap"" - the man is amazing. Bakula plays an over-the-hill actor who is presumed dead. He returns, unrecognized, to test for the role he was born to play: himself! The biopic is being written and directed by his ex-wife. Along the way, he begins to see himself as others had seen him. Lessons will be learned all around. Fans of Bakula will thoroughly enjoy this film.",1178496000,9,515,4.670329670329671
2113075,4,B0002PUGUW,"I bought this DVD on a whim, as I'd never heard of it.  And frankly, it's a cute little low budget gem that I'm glad I came across.  The nutshell is that a has-been actor, Bobby Cellini, played smarmily by Scott Bakula, has an accident after losing out on yet another role, and disappears for 6 weeks.  He returns to Hollywood to discover his ex-wife is writing and directing a movie about his life.  His ego being slightly larger than his intellect, Cellini decides to audition for the role of himself, reasoning that nobody can play him better than himself.  Although his best friend cautions that this is a very bad idea, Cellini takes on a stage name and gets the role.

  What follows is reminiscent of Ebeneezer Scrooge getting a look at his life in A Christmas Carol; Cellini sees the ""high points"" of his life and his relationship with his wife, Chelsea, from her point of view, and it's not flattering.  We see not only what a selfish human being Cellini was, but also the effect of acting out the movie from Chelsea's perspective has on Cellini himself.  What's nice about the performance is that there is no ""a-ha"" moment where Cellini changes; rather, we see that he is basically a nice guy who let his self-absorption and his desire for fame ruin his marriage and make him a jerk.

  All the performances, from the ex-wife, to the best friend, to the very funny bus stop guy, are subtle and just on point enough to nudge Cellini in the right direction.  I kept expecting some moralizing sermon, but the film never goes there.

  This is a sweet film; I recommend it.",1126310400,31,1579,4.522968197879859
2113076,4,B0002PUGUW,"Once it got going, you could see Scott Bakula the way we're used to seeing him in his Quantum Leap role...full of emotion, a character that you grow to love, etc. I really loved the way he connected with the man at the bus stop, the story line between those two characters, and how that part of the movie shows what a big impact one person (no matter how ""great"" or ""small"") can make on other people's lives. Something else it really makes you think about is...""What will people say about YOU when you're gone?""",1124409600,15,511,4.389473684210526
8030270,5,B0002PUGUW,An awesome role for Scott! Wish he had more like this one...,1505779200,,60,4.083333333333333
8030271,3,B0002PUGUW,"The DVD was posted as Closed-Captioned and it is not. The sound is bad, so I had trouble understanding a lot of the dialogue. So disappointed because I am a huge Scott Bakula fan. If I could have heard it better I would have given it a 5 star rating.",1487030400,,250,4.02
8030272,5,B0002PUGUW,"A really good indie film. I only bought this because it was filmed in Jayne Mansfield's ""Pink Palace"" inside the house and around the famous heart shaped pool before it was torn don in 2002. It actually turned out to be a really decent film. Scott Bakula is a GREAT actor and makes this film worth watching playing a washed up film star learning his lesson, with a faked death scenario and re-emerging as a totally different star to play himself in a TV movie and resolve diferences with his ex wife. Very well acted by all.",1483920000,,524,4.412371134020619
8030273,5,B0002PUGUW,Cute lighthearted comedy with my favorite Scott Bakula!  Good for a Fri night with a glass of wine!,1459555200,,99,4.5
8030274,4,B0002PUGUW,"Very enjoyable! Even though it is not very probable, I still enjoyed waiting to see how it would turn out.",1377475200,,106,4.35
8030275,4,B0002PUGUW,"Loved reading all the other reviews here because they know what a versatile, exceptionally good actor Scott Bakula is.
This is just one of those movies that yeah, a bit cheesy, but a nice, good-hearted movie. No blood, no gore, no swearing, not showing anyone in a degrading or demeaning light (like all these horrible ""reality"" shows that are causing the decline of our society).
So if you just want some easy watching that has a good ending to it...give it a try!",1370822400,,465,4.614457831325301
8030276,5,B0002PUGUW,Fun movie--terrific story and great joy to watch.  Love any films about Hollywood and what it can do to a person.  Scott Bakula did so well on this film and I will watch it many times.,1362960000,,184,4.083333333333333
8030277,1,B0002PUGUW,"very disappointing ... never even got to watch it ... was ""advertised"" as Closed Captioned for the deaf ---- it was NOT ...",1350864000,,123,4.391304347826087
8030278,5,B0002PUGUW,"I am so glad I purchased this movie. Never really knew it existed. Wonderful job done by Scott Bakula. This movie transforms a self centered, jerky actor (Bobby Cellini) in to a person that realizes that he needs to care about others before himself. I love the part with the gentleman at the bus stop and how one person can transform another person. It is a fun, sensitive, sad, and romantic movie all rolled up into one. It is a movie that makes you smile after watching. I love this movie!",1319414400,,491,4.406593406593407
8030279,5,B0002PUGUW,"Scott Bakula is quite possibly the most underrated actor of our time.  His performance in this movie (as in all his roles) is wonderful.  He has the ability to actually change his appearance  to resemble the character he is playing, something which he displayed many times in the series Quantum Leap, where he played a different character every week (sometimes a woman, a young man, even a chimpanzee.  Don't miss the chance to see him in anything!",1229126400,3,448,4.779220779220779
