8549201,4,B00AAKW0BM,"This is UVERworld's 6th live DVD and the first since 2011 Premium Live Christmas.
The Regular Edition and Limited Edition DVD's are identical.

The only difference between the two versions is a booklet of photographs from the arena tour during the summer of 2012, when this show was performed. Hardcore fans will want the booklet, but the usual LE-extra-bonus DVD material is absent.

The UVERworld fan community, hyped over the contents of THE ONE cd, was a little iffy on this DVD since it is missing a decent chunk of the new material. The concert that was recorded was last summer, and they didn't start performing the newest songs until later in the fall and winter of 2012/2013 (as I write this, in fact.)
Having said that, the concern just flies out the window once the lights in the arena go out and it is one more damn good concert performance from UVERworld.

I have to particularly draw attention to the grouping that begins with ""massive"" and goes through No. 1 - arguably THE best segment of the entire show.  ""massive"" is even better live than in the studio, and with a second small drum set installed for Takuya-san to assist, it's quite fun to watch.  I didn't think 7th Trigger could possibly be any better as a live version, but the audience goes absolutely mad, and the song translates to the stage extremely well. The Chimimouryou March is fun, and Tokyo Midnight Sun is extremely well done (and features Takuya-san on piano).  No. 1 is very special; I won't spoil the surprise, but Takuya fans will love it.  This show occurred just two days after the anniversary of the band's debut single in 2005, and emotions were running high.

Honestly you can just continue this little run beyond No. 1 right through to the end of the concert. It is a fantastic ending to a surprisingly good show.  Rather than do an encore, all members of the band step forward to say a little bit to the audience, and that's a nice change.

There is speculation - purely fan-based - that since a good chunk of the January 2013 Saitama Super Arena show has been broadcast on Japanese TV, that maybe another DVD featuring most of THE ONE songs might be in the works. Again, this is wishful thinking with no basis in reality. But if budget is a concern, you may want to hold off for just a little and see.

The additional DVD features their standard montage of clips from every single show done in the 2012 summer tour, along with some backstage moments and reactions from fans who attended the concerts. It is by nature a little repetitive, but it's fun to see.",1359936000,,2882,4.660749506903353
