8114066,5,B000ET6V4G,"Although it's called ""The Matt Hardy Show Season 1"" it would eventually become ""The Hardy Show"" Here's what you get for the first season.

The Egg Duel - They throw eggs at each other, thinking it's just going for a laugh until they find out . . . eggs actually hurt lol (EGGS KILL!)

House of Pain - Matt Hardy does his first workout after having reconstructive surgery on his knee. Interesting thing is that Matt said in an interview that he got the call that he was released after a workout, I wonder if this was it. Lots of good music is in this episode too.

Crazy Joe - Crazy Joe puts on a shocking dog collar and tries to make it as far from the owner as possible. Pretty awesome!

Lori - A episode all about Lori doing a video in her underwear. But it's only a minute long.

The Troll Bridge - Probably my favorite episode on the dvd. They go to a bridge and Matt pretends to be an evil Troll while Jeff tries to interact with him. It's like something two little kids would do but when it's the Hardyz you never know what you're gonna get. Awesome!

Scarlet - Their cousin Scarlet visits Matt's house and jumps into his jacuzzi out of the blue. She's interesting to watch.

The House Party - Friends, Boooze, games, funny interviews, it's a Hardy Party. Awesomeness!

Deep in the Imag-I - It's Basically Jeff & Shannon being random outside while Matt wakes up. It's pretty funny just to hear them ramble on about random stuff.

The Re-Enacment - It's a re-enactment of the Matt & Lita break-up with Matt Hardy and a Lita cardboard cut out, very serious episode of the Hardy Show but has its comical moments

Burning V1 - The Hardys love to burn things and they burn a Matt Hardy V1 statue that Jeff built, plus you get to see a lot of the gigantic works that Jeff has. Great episode.

Point Pleasant - Matt being random on a beach, good episode but short

Andrew's Accident - This episode at first kinda freaked me out because they Hardyz and the creator of the show Andrew go out to a lake and Andrew falls facedown in the water and doesn't get back up. The rest of the episode is trying to revive him and they didn't say if he was okay or not. Then I found out in Season 4 that he wasn't really hurt, they we're going for a ""Punk'd"" idea on the Hardy Show fans, they even used a different camera for it.

The BBQ - Meeting the family and Matt making them do random things on camera, lol

All in all it's a good first season and is a good start to what would become a big thing of the Hardy Boyz.",1330732800,,2505,4.202505219206681
