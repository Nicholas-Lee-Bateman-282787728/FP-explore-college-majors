Nonetheless, this is  a wonderful movie, at times hilariously awful. Which, I guess, is what  makes it so great. I love this movie, and it was pretty much the best in  the series, even though I know that doesn't say a whole lot. Who cares. If  you like movies you don't have to think about, rent or buy this, and enjoy.  I sure did.  END",904521600,,466,4.287356321839081
232205,4,6300214087,"This one manages to avoid the guy-in-a-mask-killing-policemen-and-teenagers format this time around by making the identity of the killer a mystery.  The story is pretty well done for this type of low-budget horror flick, and Betsy Palmer's acting very frightening.  The abundant gore was enough to ensure commercial success, but the story itself shouldn't be ignored.  Try it, you'll like it!  END",902188800,,397,5.459016393442623

232314,5,6300214087,"I'm not sure what the rest of you got...  but this was the original remastered Friday the 13th from like 1980...  and when it comes to slasher flicks, this and the 1978 Halloween are where it's at...  The gold standard...

While, yeah, this was almost a B-rate flick due to some cheesy acting and whatnot...  This is like the pinnacle of slashers...  Part of its success, I believe, was the ""perfect"" soundtrack...  Movies like this, Jaws and Halloween managed to knock out KILLER soundtracks...  The soundtracks, without even looking at the screen, start making your heart pump...  The ""ch ch ch ah ah ah"" is without a doubt one of the best...

I don't believe either flick is really a ""5 star"" flick, but I'll tell you this...  they beat out a TON of later and modern slashers, despite being 40 years old...  and nearly everyone and their mother has tried to copy them...  pretty much all failing...

This new incarnation of Jason is more sophisticated than his predecessor, using bear traps to catch some of his victims, tripwires to alert him of potential victims, and a bow and arrow at one point to reach from land someone in a boat.
It lived up to the franchise's tendency for nudity and horny teen victims. Jason's ruthlessness and sadistic tendency to toy with some of his victims was preserved.  A great ending as well.",1515888000,,533,4.720430107526882

Because honestly it's a ripoff of Halloween which Sean Cunningham openly admits to! That being said most of the series would follow a same formula until they ran out of ideas and sent Jason out into space. Unlikeable teenagers come out to Camp Crystal lake with basically ""making love"" in mind and get systematically slaughtered off. What really elevates this one past all the others is the presence of Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees who openly admitted to not thinking highly of the script.

But there was like 13 minutes left and I never actually saw Jason ONCE! All his kills were in first person. So you would only see what HE saw not what the victim saw. So someone who never knew about Jason and his movies would have no idea who the killer is. Also why whenever someone dies the camera pans away and all you hear is them scream, it never even shows them getting killed. Not to sound like a crazy person but aren't horror movies supposed to show people getting killed without the camera panning away? This movie was SO boring that I fell asleep during it at 10:00 in the morning! I thought that it would at least show Jason.",1508889600,3,755,4.142857142857143

232556,4,6300214087,"Forever a classic.  Yet I am hesitant to recommend this low budget slasher to anyone who didn't grow up in this era.  Its no longer exciting to me, but it holds a special significance.

The young counselor staff are stalked and murdered one by one by a mysterious killer while preparing to reopen Camp Crystal Lake which, decades earlier, was the site of a child's drowningJason Voorhees.  Among our summer staff of victims are Alice (Adrienne King; Friday the 13th Part 2, The Butterfly Room), Jack (Kevin Bacon; Hollow Man, Tremors) and Brenda (Laurie Bartram; The House of Seven Corpses).

Harbinger SIDEBAR: One of the more celebrated horror tropes has been the harbingerthe warning sign (person, symbol, legend or otherwise) suggesting you turn back now. Weve seen inbred hillbilly attendants of near-abandoned gas stations, twitchy hitchhikers, or crazy old town criers up and down the genre saying things like you don't want to go down there or not since all those murders or, in the case of this movie, a death curse; you're all doomed.  Well, this classic has two back-to-back harbingers who garner an awful lot of screen time.  Apparently, after a 1957 drowning there were two murders in 1958 resulting in closing the camp.  So, I guess whatever teenagers take this summer job deserve to die for ignoring all the warnings.

Throughout the film were left to wonder just who the killer truly is.  We catch glimpses of the killers hand and shirt, appearing to be that of a totally normal personno monstrous hands, tattered blood-stained garments or over-sized build.  So, when a tightly wound sheriff (Ron Millkie; A Return to Salems Lot) or one of our looney harbingers (Walt Gorney; Friday the 13th Part 2 & VII) or Mrs. Voorhees (Betsy Palmer; Friday the 13th Part 2) shows up at camp, our guard is up.
As someone who grew up on this franchise, I continue to enjoy it for what it meant at the time and my own nostalgia.  First-time viewers won't be so impressed as the pacing is quite slow by todays standards and the third-act confrontation (basically a long cat-and-mouse skirmish with the killer) probably won't feel exciting compared to the fast-paced shock value so often found in modern horror.

With a humble estimated budget of $550K, director Sean S. Cunningham (DeepStar Six) brought us an iconic summer revenge slasher.  We often enjoy the killers POV, but the kills almost entirely occur off-camera.  Being early in the new wave of slashers, the death scenes aren't yet overly clever. Some implied stabbings, a slit throat, an arrow through the neck (Kevin Bacon), an axe-impaled head, and a rather classic decapitation. Reminiscent of Halloween (1978), one counselor is found pin-cushioned against a door.

For older horror fans this will forever be a classic.  For younger fansI really have no idea and am hesitant to recommend this to anyone who didn't grow up in this era.  Its no longer exciting to me, but it holds a special significance.",1506816000,2,2966,4.898

What's there NOT to like about it-especially when comparing it to the original (and that's pretty-much all anyone can seem to do).  The best part:  It MAKES SENSE!  Jason RUNS!  Jason has a labyrinth of tunnels under the camp, which he's been constructing for years.  In the original, he didn't run and he had nothing-no real reason to always be RIGHT behind the person running for his or her life except that he's freaking JASON and that's just stupid.

This is a unique slasher flick that stands all by itself - whoever has watched this movie will never look at JC Penney St John's Bay Sweaters the same way, EVER again - especially the ivory colored ones.

The bloodwerks are great and the ending still haunts me to this day.

Wait for a rainy, stormy night - dim the lights, grab some snacks, and let the horror begin! Take an intermission after this one and then watch II-IV in a row for a Crystal Lake 1984 Massacre Marathon.

Spooky tidbit: The actress playing Alice was going to reprise her role for F13 Pt 2, but decided against it as she had a real-life prowler stalking her after the success of this original. She is still in the 2nd film, in one of the longest and best horror openings ever. Enjoy!

Other suggestions for people who enjoy this (besides Halloween): Black Friday, Terror Train, and the Prowler.
Lastly - another suggestion if you don't want to watch multiple slashers  in a row - pair this baby with Dawn of the Dead - a great double feature.",1485475200,4,1163,4.466981132075472

Nothing really new in the killing department, but still a fun watch on a Saturday afternoon. All though the underground tunnels were a bit of a stretch for me. Not to mention the electricity. That implies Jason would have to have to a trade school to learn how to become an electrician. unless he just kidnapped a few con-ed guys to wire the place up and then slaughter them as oppose to paying them. In order to really enjoy this movie, you need a few drink with it and you have to suspend a lot of disbelief. I mean like totally remove for brain in stash it in your porn drawer. Also I don't like Jared Padelecki in this. He seems to be running on autopilot without any personality cause all he know is how to be Sam Winchester. His character Clay (stupid name, by the way and not to mention he did not look like a Clay) would have been better portrayed by the groundhog from Caddyshack or possibly by Kermit the Frog..",1485129600,,1012,4.194871794871795

In many ways, it's also a bridge from the clunkier horror flicks of the preceding decade. The effects are often laughable, the acting is paper-thin and the production values seem extremely cheap and dated. Very few of the characters are even remotely likeable, either, which makes their relentless slaughter into something of a spectator sport. Once it ditches the vague premonitions and hammy teenage dialog that flood the first act, the film settles into a nice groove: stalk, scare, chase, kill, repeat. The mainstream success of Jason as a horror icon even gives this first entry a little boost, misleading first-time viewers into a surprise reveal at the climax (and, of course, an infamous jump-scare just before the credits). From a critical perspective it's not good, but lasting influence and dogged determination carry it a long way.",1475452800,2,1082,5.2601156069364166

This is one of the better remakes, although the plot itself is pretty stupid. Much better than the nightmare on elm street remake, but this does not beat the original in terms of story and even the death scenes. While more gory, the original set the standard and the original plot made a ton of more sense in terms of realism.

This story takes the original and turns it into a mess, and uses the most stereotypical characters you can find. You do not really connect with the characters except for clay and the girl (what's her name? Not the sister, but the girlfriend..)...see what I mean? I can't even remember the characters I liked.

Jason is the only thing that saves the film. Jason is by far a real bad a...He is vicious and relentless and it seems like nothing can stop him. He is big and mean and shows no mercy. That is the only reason I am giving this three stars. If they stuck with the original story and maybe added jason to the mix, then it would have been better. But, they dropped the ball on the stereotyped character placement. Maybe if the characters were more serious it would have made the deaths that more gruesome.

Movie is good but it lacked the jaw dropping suspense and original kill style that made Jason V who he really is . Hopefully next time Friday the 13th is produced the director will seriously push the envelope when it comes to  hack em up slasher flicks.  Stop being so tame.  We can see tame online all day free.

This is the original camp slasher. Two things make this movie standout to me, one is the many shots of ambience. It really builds the atmosphere. We see the sky getting darker, the silence of the forest, it's all done really well. The second thing is the fact that the killer is not who you expect if you've just heard about these type of movies. It's not a certain maniac in a hockey mask, is all I will say. Overall, this movie to me is just not as interesting as Part II or III, but it's better than the later movies in the series.

I am getting ready to buy the digital version of this movie as a present for my mother soon but I do have the DVD. I remember when I purchased it I wasn't so sure that I would like it because, let's face it the series started to become a bit ridiculous (Jason X and Jason Goes to Hell). However, I was pleasantly surprised with this one so much that the opening scene was huge shocker for me and caused me to cuss out loud because I wasn't ready for it. What I wasn't ready for was Jason to move fast. Not just move fast but actually run. Y'all know he never ran in the original franchise, he always slow stalked then magically appeared.  It also showed Jason to have a bit of intelligence. He wasn't just mindlessly killing. It made him closer to the type of threat I always felt Michael Myers was from the original Halloween franchise.

If by chance fans of the franchise have not yet seen this (I can't imagine it would take this long) keep this in mind that it is a reimage of the original Jason Voorhees and it is NOT a remake of the original Friday the 13th because Jason was the killer in that one.

For it is worth a watch if for no other reason than to see Jason Voorhees as modern threat who means business.",1446422400,2,1245,4.222689075630252
233926,1,6300214087,"Possibly the least scary mainstream slasher of all time. Not fit to lace the boots of Halloween or The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.

Most of the deaths take place off camera; it seems that the budget only extended to two major on-camera shots. But the single biggest structural problem with the film is that all of the deaths take place *in secret*, so up to halfway through the final reel, none of the teens at Camp Crystal Lake actually realize they're in any danger. While some of them are getting bumped off in distant buildings, the bulk of them are happily playing Monopoly. This means we never get to experience any *fear* vicariously through any of the characters, because, well, none of them are experiencing any.

And the confrontation between the killer and the Final Girl is hilariously awful: she has three clear opportunities to end the killer's life, and doesn't take any of them. By the end I was yelling for the killer to succeed.

A terrible piece of low-budget film-making. I suspect it only became a success because of the catchy title; the film itself is awful, even by the standards of the time. John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" in particular is vastly superior.",1446249600,2,1177,4.759803921568627

233928,5,6300214087,"What you need to know about the plot:  It starts out at Camp Crystal Lake back, June 13th, 1980 during a dark rainy night.  A young teen counselor is being chased, slapped, and cussed out by Mrs. Voorhees.  Of course the counselor grabs a machete and decapitates Mrs. Voorhees. After the counselor runs away, Jason as a little boy, sees his mother's corpse with her head severed, grabs her locket with pics in it, and imagines her telling him to avenge her death.  Next a group of friends go to the now shut down campgrounds in present day 2009 to find and sell some marijuana growing in the woods.  Jason slaughters 4 of them and they leave it ambiguous as to whether or not he kills this girl named Whitney of whom was with them.  Six weeks later:  A young guy named Clay Miller is at a convenience store asking the clerk to put up missing posters of his sister Whitney.  A complete d****bag named Trent gives Clay a hard time about how long he's taking while Trent's friend's pump gas and get junk food and whatnot.  Clay moves on only to find out that the cops have given up the search for his sister and that Clay should try looking elsewhere.  Clay next asks some weirdo old lady who's too afraid of Jason to help.  Then Clay comes accross an eccentric young marijuana farmer named Donnie.  Unfortunately Donnie doesn't know of Whitney's whereabouts.  After Clay leaves it isn't long before Jason comes around with a burlap sack on his head and stalks Donnie around the barn.  Jason eventually kills Donnie and sees that Donnie happened to have a hockey mask and now Jason dons the mask for the first time.  As Trent and his friend's party on Crystal Lake's grounds and as Clay roams around looking for his sister, Jason won't be far behind to institute a major bloodbath.  Is Clay up to taking Jason on?  Hopefully he'll muster the strength to before it's too late.

Some facts: This movie was released on Friday February 13, 2009.  It was directed by Marcus Nispel(Texas Chainsaw Massacre(2003).  The producers are: Andrew Form, Brad Fuller, Michael Bay, and Sean S. Cunningham.  The music is by Steve Jablonsky.  The budget was $19,000,000. Finally the domestic gross is $65,002,019.

This movie pays loving tribute to Friday the 13th parts 1-4.  Marcus Nispel proves once again to be an ideal choice as the director, just as he proved the same with his remake of TCM.  It was wonderful to get Sean S. Cunningham to be a part of the making of it once again.  Steve Jablonsky gives one riveting score, embodying, emotion, mood, and a great deal of tension overall.

The great feeling of atmosphere and isolation were once again well established.  The editing was very good in that the movie never drags on endlessly at any time.

The gore, that's on camera, is very realistic looking and would make Tom Savini smile.  The kill scenes are gripping, disturbing, and brilliantly handled.

The scream queens is this movie a very beautiful and extremely hot.  The nudity is nothing short of sensational, also.

Clay proves to be an honorable enough character that you wish to will definitely root for him and hope that he finds his sister Whitney alive, so that he can save her.

Derek Mears was very frightening as Jason.  Not as good as Kane Hodder, but not far off either.

Overall, if you love Friday the 13th and Jason and wish to see a remake of a classic slasher done incredibly right, paying full attention to how the originals were done as well as incorporating several elements of parts 1-4, plus offering some surprises at times, when then I think that this one will prove to be well worth in weight in gold for you.",1446076800,3,3630,4.599688473520249

First off, this isn't a super scary movie. If your looking for something to keep you up at night, don't get this. Aside from a few jump scares I never really flinched once during this movie. It starts out as a classic ""haunted summer camp"" story until you eventually learn more about the camps history and about the famous ""Jason"". Honestly this was more funny to me than it was scary. Combat at the end is pathetic and like most horror movies, you end up yelling ""WTF ARE YOU DOING!?"" to the characters. It was still an enjoyable movie and no doubt I'll be picking up a few more in the series if they drop to $4 like this one. Picture is surprisingly clear for a 1980 movie and I was glad I picked this up over the Blu-Ray remake. All in all if you like not-so-scary horror movies, you'll definitely want to pick this one up.",1444003200,,853,4.371069182389937

234048,5,6300214087,"Some facts about the movie:  Friday the 13th was directed and produced by Sean S. Cunningham.  The gore and makeup effects were done by the great Tom ""Sex Machine Savini.  The musical score was by Harry Manfredini.  The alternate title to the movie is A Long Night at Camp Blood.  It was shot in and around Blairstown and Hope New Jersey.  The camp used in the movie is a real life Boy Scout camp named, Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco.  The movie was distributed by Paramount.  The budget was $550,000.  The opening weekend saw an amount of $5,816,321.  It's total domestic gross was $39,754,601.  Finally, it's theatrical release was on May 9, 1980.

The plot:  After singing some songs with the kids, two horny camp counselors go to the attic to have sex.  Meanwhile, someone unknown and unseen is creeping up the steps.  This person stabs the male counselor and the female counselor is frantically moving around while cornered, then there's a freeze frame of her screaming.  The opening credits roll including an eerie theme song by Harry Manfredini.  The movie now focuses on a beautiful teen girl named Annie who got a job at as a cook at Camp Crystal Lake.  She enters a small town and comes to a diner and gets a ride from a trucker named Enos.  They come accross a weird old man known as Crazy Ralph.  Crazy Ralph makes claim that Camp Crystal Lake is cursed.  They just ignore his warning(s) and go on.  Enos then tells Annie about the past misfortunes at Camp Crystal Lake; including things like, the drowning of an 11 year old boy named Jason Voorhees in 1957 and the water going bad in 1962.  The new owner Steve Christy continues to keep the camp going all the same.  We next meet 3 other counselors to be, Ned, Marcie, and Jack(Kevin Bacon).  Next you meet Steve Christy and his handy girl Alice and Bill.  Annie next accepts a ride from a silent and unseen driver.  The driver passes the turn to the camp, Annie jumps out of the car while it's moving, the driver chases her, and slits her throat.  Meanwhile, an obnoxious cop named Officer Dorf is searching for Crazy Ralph.  No one knows that Annie is dead nor do they know the danger that's soon to befall them.  Who the killer is is anyone's guess.

This movie utilizes cool methods such as first person camera perspectives are a very clever and effectively scary element that's often used whenever the killer is watching and stalking the victims.  The creeping camera pans work very well also, to say nothing of the killers eerie ki ki ki ki ma ma ma ma sounds are bound to send shivers up your spine.

The night scenes are all beautifully lit.  The night shots of the full moon make for some incredibly creepy feelings of unease.  I particularly love the crossfade including the full moon, Alice running from the killer, and the up close shot of the killers mouth.  Totally brilliant.

Tom Savini's gore effects are incredibly realistic looking and at the time, beyond compare.  The kill scenes are very unique and a great way to start the franchise off.

Sadly there's nothing much going on with the nudity, but that doesn't ruin anything.

Some of my favorite kill scenes are:  One of the counselors getting an arrow through the throat, the axe to the eye that another one got, and Annie's throat being slit.  All are very realistic looking and flawless.

SPOILER ALERT: I will talk about the ending some.  If you haven't seen this movie than you might want to skip this part.
After it's discovered that Mrs. Voorhees is the killer and after quite a chase and struggle between them, the slo-mo used for when Alice charges at Mrs. Voorhees and decapitates her with a machete is just awesome and effective.  The gore effect used for her head coming off is very well done.  The next scene where Alice is in a boat with the peaceful and cheery new age like music in the background and Alice seeing the cops on land giving off a false sense of security was genius.  Especially since what next transpires is little Jason jumps out of water and pulls Alice down in the drink.  Lastly, when at the hospital Alice tells the sheriff about what had happened and he never came up with anything regarding a young boy jumping out of the water.  That being the case, what really happened is a total mystery.  The mystery and ambiguity to that ending is a very practical closer to the movie.
END OF SPOILERS

Overall, If you love a good slasher and/or 80's horror movie, with such events as beautiful and sexy people, realistic looking gore effects, campy characters, a complete murder mystery that keeps you guessing, well lit night scenes, eerie music, first person stalker camera perspectives, a location that boasts both an incredible sense of atmosphere as well as isolation, great suspense, and very unique and original kill scenes than this great classic slasher should prove to be right up your alley.",1443052800,5,4852,4.622950819672131
234049,5,6300214087,"With Halloween coming I thought this would be a great add to my VHS collection. Not only do I watch the Friday the 13th movies every Halloween season and prefer not to have it edited, I also can watch them over and over during Oct and thought it'd be great to have. I started with the first and will add the others. This is also one of my favorites from childhood. I was an early 80's kid..born in the late 70's and it reminds me of sleepovers with my little girlfriends..her parents driving us to the video store to rent a few movies that we'd watch in the dark, giggle and scream...and then be scared to sleep. :) This was one of our favorites (along with parts 2-8)  Always so scary.. probably really cheesy to the later generations, with their special effects and more complex story lines....unlike the simple ""mom wants to get revenge on all camp counselors after her son drowned because of negligence"" (Darned teenagers and their hormones getting them slashed, haha)  blah blah. Simple, great and scary, to me still! I also love ""Jason"" more than Michael or Freddy SO I just love this movie and the rest of them.  Glad I bought..I recommend..  I am noticing how dark the movie is..I know it takes place mostly at night but wow, bad lighting. lol  This is a classic..love love. Cant wait to get the rest of them.

234094,5,6300214087,"I saw this with my dearly departed father in 2009 and enjoyed every minute of it.

This was more of a retooling then a remake let's be honest about that.

The characters were the predictable stereotypes and half of them didn't really add much they were merely there to add to Jasons list of victims.

The movie was funny in parts and certain characters kept the movie somewhat light for such a dark and macabre version of the horror fans beloved psycho.

The twist was also enjoyable regarding the traditional horror concept of the final girl.

Lastly but certainly not least Derek Mears was fantastic as the new , far faster, and more terrifying version of Jason.

Not to limit or lessen my love for Kane Hodders equally terrifying Jason mind you.

They were both credible and well realized versions of the camp slasher.

In the end a terrifying and intense experience that I absolutely loved.

Put it to you this way seeing Jason rushing right up to his victims was a freaky experience to witness.",1441843200,,999,4.630681818181818

The film explores counselors coming to Crystal Lake to help Steve Christie rejuvenate the defunct Camp Crystal Lake.  Camp Crystal Lake has a legacy of problems, and there is one unhappy camper that wants to ensure the camp never operates again.  The counselors experience freak occurrences that build up to a night of terror, and the revelation of the murderer represents a twist for the time as no one expected it to be who it was.

While the sequels over time diminished the brand as a whole, the original four films, starting with this one, are a great way to spend a dark stormy night enjoying some horror films.",1417824000,,821,4.446666666666666

234728,5,6300214087,"This review is for the original 1980 Friday the 13th, uncut version. I first saw this movie trailer on local TV and being 13, I couldn't go and see it with the R rating. I wanted to see it badly, but I didn't have to wait long, as cable TV came to town in the same year. It eventually got aired and I enjoyed it, although this is the ""Uncut"" version. During that time, scenes in horror movies were cut or deleted for the theatrical release as too graphic. In order to keep the R rating, things had to be snipped. Alas, years later we get to actually see what was cut out originally. Today, of course, in the age of ""remakes and more graphic scenes are better"", the scenes are probably tame. Hey, it's over 30 years old and still holds up to be one of the best and original horror movies of the decade.

 Sure, Halloween came out 2 years prior, but no one had done a ""killer on the loose in the forest"" movie before and now we had one. When watching these early horror genre movies, you can't help but notice similarities in all of them. Someone is getting stalked, stabbed, butchered or mauled. It's basically a rehash but with different characters and a different storyline to keep it interesting. So, now we had two franchises in the making. One had Michael Myers, a psychotic maniac hunting down his sister and anyone that gets in his way, and this one, Jason, a poor kid that just happened to be swimming in Crystal lake and drowned when the Camp Counselors were being naughty. His mother is absolutely pissed off at the Camp and does everything in her power to make sure that Camp Crystal Lake is never opened again and she'll even kill for it.

 You really don't know who the killer is up until the end of the movie, which is pretty good considering it left you guessing as to whom it would be and for what reason. Ah, but everything comes out in the end and we finally get to know who the killer is. A ""Final"" battle between the last Camp Counselor and the ""killer"" ensues with the latter meeting an end fit for a horror movie of the '80s. The Counselor having vanquished the ""killer"" once and for all, sets sail on a nearby lake boat in the dark. She seemingly ""awakens"" in the morning sun to see a police car on the distant shore. Within the peace of her ""solitude"" on the lake comes a shocking end, as ""Jason"" the kid that drowned, comes forth out of the lake to pull down the Counselor to the watery depths. This movie along with Halloween, Terror Train, Prom Night and Psycho before them, set a precedent for the ""Decade of Splatter"". Let the sequels begin !!

This is probably the best one with part 2 being a close second. The rest are absolutely terrible. Instead of other slashers like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, and A Nightmare On Elm Street, Friday The 13th relies much more on sex, nudity, and straight up killing then those films.

234794,5,6300214087,"In 1957, 11 year old Jason Voorhees heads to Camp Crystal Lake with his mother Pamela Sue and father Elias for a summer of camping. Unfortunately for Jason, this would be his last summer. While his mom was cooking in the kitchen, Jason drowned in Crystal Lake while the camp counselors who were supposed to be watching him were were off having sex. Pamela blamed the counselors for Jason's death (vowing to kill every teenager and person who returns to the camp) and in 1958, two camp counselors are murdered. The camp is immediately shut down due to the violent murders. In 1962, the camp was ready to re-open and it turns out they can't open because the water was bad. Several years later a bunch of fires were started. In 1979, Steve Christie and 7 counselors are ready to re-open the camp despite warnings from people in town that the camp is nicknamed ""Camp Blood"" and has a death curse because of the prior murders.

One by one 6 of the 7 camp counselors are violently murdered by an unknown killer. Only one of the counselors survives setting up a final showdown with the killer who is not seen on screen for nearly the entire movie. Who will survive?",1412467200,,1158,4.514285714285714

234840,3,6300214087,"Friday The 13th 2009, as you all know, is a remake of the classic horror franchise of the same title.  Now I probably liked this film more than most people did.  This is mostly because I didn't grow-up with Friday The 13th.  I know the basic premise and I am familiar with the character Jason, but I haven't watched very many of the films, even the first one.  At the time of this review the only Jason movies Ive seen all the way through are Jason Takes Manhattan, Jason X, Freddy vs. Jason, and now this film.  In fact, while there are some I enjoy, the whole slasher sub-genre of horror is not really a genre Im that into.  The only slasher franchise I can say Im a fan of is Halloween, which is why I refuse to see the new films by Rob Zombie given what Ive heard about them and what they did to Michael Myers.  However, as someone who isn't a big fan of the Friday franchise to begin with, I can say I had a good time with this film.  I won't say its good, but I had fun with it and thats all you can really ask for with a movie like this.

The films does many things right that I don't think its given credit for.  The scenery and the shots of the countryside look great.  The film looks beautiful.  They shot this movie on location as opposed to a studio and it shows.  The film has a good atmosphere and suspense which you rarely see in horror films today especially remakes.  The score, while not great, gets the job done.  I also really like this Jason.  People say they screwed with Jason here but I don't see that.  Again, Im not a big fan of this series, but from what I understand about Jason I think they captured the character great.  I love Jasons look in the hockey mask and even with the bag over his head in the beginning.  Some people say Jason looks too bulky but I thought he looked better that way.  They were really trying to make Jason menacing again and I think they succeeded.  You even have some decent kills with some slight creativity.

I also like how they do things slightly different in who survives.  Usually in these films everyone dies except for the lead girl and it comes down between her and the killer.  Here both the main girl and guy survive.  Also the girl you think is the lead girl actually dies, which is a bit unexpected.

There are a couple characters I like.  Usually in slasher films, especially nowadays, the characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, which is mostly the case here but with an exception.  This film, at least, has some star power.  You have Jared Padalecki who is famous for his role in the TV series Supernatural, which I am a fan of.  From someone whos watched Supernatural nearly from beginning to end I can say that Jared is a great actor and I think he did a good job here.  His character, Clay Miller, is the only character who isn't bland.  His back story with his mother dying and his sister being kidnapped by Jason at the beginning of the film is sad, makes feel sympathy for him, and makes you want to root for him.  I also like that you have a character who is actually pursuing Jason rather than just being another random teenager at the wrong place at the wrong time.  I also like the girl, Jenna, played by Danielle Panabaker.  Shes bland, but shes a nice girl who stands-up for Jareds character which made me like her.

The film, while fun, I cant say is that good.  It is a run-of-the-mill slasher when you get down to it.  All the characters, save one or two, are one-dimensional and just there to be killed and the plot is paper-thin.  I know you cant really expect great characters from a slasher film but there have been slashers that have had them like Halloween.  It doesnt even try to do anything new with Jason.  Granted Jason sets traps which is something I haven't really seen, but thats it.  I kind of wanted them to do something a bit different since this is a reboot.

He doesnt do anything I haven't seen him do in the Jason movies Ive seen before.  The film does have one or two slightly creative kills, but many of them are uninspired.  The kills aren't bad by any stretch but I was hoping for a bit more creativity especially since this franchise has become known for its creative kills.  Ive seen many horror movies including several slashers where Ive seen many ways for people to be killed, so the kills didn't impress me as much.

Overall though, I enjoyed this.  As far as slasher films go I think it was a decent, fun popcorn flick.  Its not good, but its definitely not bad like many people say it is.  Yes, its playing it safe and not taking many risks.  I wish they explore the characters more or explore Jason more than they have before.  However, Ive seen films try to do that and fail miserably like Halloween 6.  Id much rather have a fun and safe movie like this than have another Halloween 6.  All-in-all if you want a fun horror movie to watch with your friends on Halloween or something then check this out if you want.",1409270400,,4942,4.308360477741585
234841,3,6300214087,"Where to begin?

Given the huge success of director John Carpenter's 1978 horror/suspense classic HALLOWEEN, it was almost inevitable that its story of teens being stalked (and frequently killed) by a maniac would be exploited by other films.  What nobody anticipated, of course, was to the extremes to which this would happen--not just with a handful of films, but with tens, hundreds, and, by now, perhaps even thousands of them.  And the 1980 film FRIDAY THE 13TH was perhaps the biggest of the HALLOWEEN-inspired imitations.

One doesn't have to go into the particulars of the story, because, after three and a half decades, we know what the drill is: the summer camp at Crystal Lake re-opens some twenty years after a young boy named Jason Voorhees drowned there due, in no small part, to the neglect of the camp counselors there.  Some things, though, apparently don't change, because, as before, the camp counselors and their teenage underlings engage in all matters of sexual activity; and soon, one by one, they get basically chopped up, skewered, eviscerated, and dismembered in every gory way imaginable for that time, in the manner of what may be this movie's true progenitor, the 1971 Mario Bava film TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE.  As happened in HALLOWEEN with Jamie Lee Curtis, the only one still left standing is the one of them (Adrienne King) who didn't engage in illicit sex.  The irony, though, is that when she encounters what seems to be a kindly old woman (Betsy Palmer), she meets up with the actual assailant, as Palmer is the stark-raving bonkers, vengeance-seeking mother of Jason, resulting in some actual suspense, but also with a climax and coda that would be repeated with variations for almost every other film in the series (only then, it is Jason himself doing the stalk/hack/slash thing).

It has to be said that director Sean S. Cunningham, who produced director Wes Craven's controversial 1972 horror cult classic LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, does some inventive things early on, given that he had a budget of just over half a million dollars (which probably wouldn't even cover the catering on most typical Hollywood big-budget films).  A number of the daytime scenes at Camp Crystal Lake have some of the disturbing aura of director John Boorman's 1972 classic DELIVERANCE (itself something of a horror film).  And there is an early appearance here by Kevin Bacon, basically the only person in the cast who went on to bigger and (needless to say) better things, as one of the teens who, of course, ends up getting butchered.

But in general, the whole reason for the existence of FRIDAY THE 13TH, besides to cash in on the success of the relatively blood-free HALLOWEEN, was to show the inventive and extremely graphic ways people can be hacked up, which can be credited to make-up effects wizard Tom Savini, who worked on the 1978 George Romero classic DAWN OF THE DEAD.  This really points out the fact that the very reason for the film's success is that it is also its own Achilles heel, not to mention that the fact that so many of the victims killed here are women, ushering the kind of misogyny that would become a big part of these films from here on in.  In no realistic and unbiased way can FRIDAY THE 13TH be considered a truly classic horror film in the manner of either HALLOWEEN or PSYCHO.  There are things about it that work well enough, but it still falls far short of what came before it.",1408406400,,3436,4.762626262626263

  First off, this is the 2010 remake. Which means: NO KEVIN ""FREAKIN"" BACON!!!!
The movie IS based on Jason Voorhees, and is basically a retelling of his origins. A part .01-03 of sorts. You get to see Jason's mom in the opening scene, thus part .01 is told. This remake was made by Michael Bay, who really makes Jason a very scary monster of a man (if you could call him that!). The movie was a huge success. Sadly, plans for a sequel got derailed after the huge disappointment PIRANHA 3D was.

234939,4,6300214087,"As an avid fan of the original series of Friday the 13th movies, and with the current trend of reboots & remakes of some of my favorite horror movies on the rise (I.E. Halloween, Texas Chainsaw, etc...) I was a bit apprehensive of this film. Especially after Freddy Vs. Jason seemingly spoiled my appetite, and it didn't help matters any by removing long time Jason-playing veteran Kane Hodder from behind the Hockey mask. So needless to say I was not especially excited when I heard that a remake was heading it's way to theaters.

However, after watching some interviews of Derek Mears, who was tapped to don the infamous Hockey mask and hearing his take on the character combined with the excitement he had to play him, I began to think that maybe this could actually work. Therefore I put my previous prejudices aside, killed the lights in my home, found a soft spot on the couch and settled in for the ride... and a fine ride it was!

I found myself completely engaged in the movie within the first five minutes. A nice outline was presented that remained faithful to the story's 1980 origins, while presenting a fresh perspective at the same time. The mythology of Jason was expanded upon just enough to add some real excitement to the film, but restrained at the same time, preventing those loyal to the original (like myself) any disdain.

Part of my love for the Friday movies is that they were usually able to keep their footing well inside the often stringent confines of  Horror, while incorporating some clever bits of humor. Unlike Halloween's ""go for the throat"" (pun not intended) and often over the top dramatization of Michael Myers, or Freddy's campy stand-up comedy laced, pre-kill one liners, Jason remains a menacing figure while never really getting the sense that the film is taking itself too seriously (case in point, the scene in the tool shed w/ Aaron Yoo). But make no mistake, the kills remain fierce and grizzly! Jason continues to do what he does best, terrorize his victims!

With that said, I must give proper credit to Derek Mears and his performance behind the mask! His portrayal combined the standard display of raw Jason power that I have come to know and love, with a fresh deviation of cunning, wit & stealth that infused Jason with a wide array of new, wonderful ways to dispense of people. Derek certainly earned his place (in my opinion) among the machete wielding greats of: Kane Hodder (parts: 7,8,9 & X), C.J. Graham (part 6) and Ted White (part 4).

Conclusion; whether you are an old-school die hard (like me), or new to the world of Camp Crystal Lake, I'd recommend this film to all alike. I don't think it will disappoint... so please, enjoy!!",1402358400,,2694,4.697033898305085

234941,1,6300214087,"Where do I start? This has got to be one of the WORST re-makes I've ever had the misfortune of viewing. Having grown up on repeated HBO viewings of the 1980 original, I thought I'd give this one go. I rather wish Jason had cracked my skull open with that machete. Sigh.

While the 1980 original wears on repeated viewings, it never loses the horrific charm that brought us Jason Vorhees in the first place. This movie is a travesty and an expensive abomination. I mean it. The whole plot was downright silly. I give props for a few actors, especially Jared Padalecki, who probably wanted something ""fun"" to do after an exhausting turn of Supernatural. He's fine in the movie but utterly wasted.

It's the other crap that the film throws at you and expects you to wet your pants just because some angry giant with a vendetta feels the need to off useless teenagers in especially painful and messy ways. The teenagers or twenty-somethings are REALLY annoying. By the time Jason shows up, you're relieved he even bothered to pack his knives to start chopping. Oh, he chops and slogs his way through several sex-crazed hormonal teenyboppers with a penchant for alcohol and stupidity. Check and check.

Gallons of fake blood. Check. Gratuitous nudity and a SUPER long sex scene so explicit it could be mistaken for porn. They didn't show that much flesh in Showgirls. The scene takes up nearly half the entire movie. I'm not kidding. It was completely uncalled for and out of place. But I suppose the movie was so bad, someone decided to toss that in just to make amends for taking your money.

The only consolation is the rich dude is a total douche bag who cheats on his girlfriend and deserves his comeuppance....in the form of a truck whizzing by. Hooray. He will not be sorely missed. The rest of the movie plods along with eyes being gouged out, heads being cracked open like coconuts, various teenage bodies being used as pincushions. None of the deaths are very creative nor surprising. Not terrifying either. The only thing remotely terrifying is sitting through that sex scene and not walking out of the theater to demand your money back.

If you paid good money for this when it came out, my sincerest apologies. If you paid for the DVD, you have my sympathies. In either case, the remake doesn't hold a candle to the gory and cheesy classic from 1980. See that one, yearn for the good old days, and wish Jason had torn his way through the factory before this movie made its way to the unsuspecting public.

One star for just being downright nasty and gross. It wouldn't scare the mask off Jason. It probably frightened a few agents in Hollywood, maybe.",1401494400,3,2659,4.634819532908705

235049,3,6300214087,"While technically a remake, this ""rebooted"" tale of Jason Voorhees could really just as well be yet another not-quite-thrilling example of tales involving everyone's favorite hockey-masked slasher (or sometime burlap-sacked). I'm pretty sure no one went to any actual effort to make this into a coherent or involving or otherwise memorable episode in the franchise. But then, the same could easily be said of several of the 11 OTHER Friday The 13th movies; I'd probably only give 5 stars to the first Friday, Freddy vs. Jason, and possibly Part IV (mostly 'cause it shows how Corey Feldman picked up his ""ultimate badass monster slayer"" skills), and I'm probably over-generous with the sparklies.

Actually, I suspect (or perhaps ""hope"" is more accurate, after my disappointment when Friday, 13.12.13 arrived and Jason was... hibernating?) that the main reason this movie was made at all was to get that inconvenient #12 out of the way, thus setting the stage for that ""magic 13th"" installment when Pam Voorhees' little boy's Big Day (June 13th, of course) finally lands on a Friday. Which, BTW, is happening THIS YEAR. If there is any justice in the world of horror movie mega-franchises, they were just holding back all the GOOD stuff for The Friday The 13th Part XIII Spectacular: Jason's Best Birthday Ever.... or something like that. No need to worry about continuity (original OR remake), they never *really* did before anyway; just give us a ripping good story about Jason and his cutlery collection with ""a dozen or so"" special friends joining him for his special day. I've got MY fingers crossed.

Too bad there's nothing particularly special about 34th Anniversaries (okay, a month late, big deal...). Unless, perhaps... I can't think of any particular reason Jason *couldn't* have been 12 when he drowned (in 1957), thus making him 34 in the ""movieland"" 1979 when the original film was set (rather than 1980 when it opened)... is that too much of a stretch?

I've been a fan of this series since I was 5. Yes, my parents were awesome. I've always enjoyed obnoxious and annoying college kids get killed. And this revamp was well-overdue. Here you have a much more intelligent, leaner, and expert hunter version of Jason which was a nice upgrade considering he's been a retarded slashy bear of a man with a seemingly magical ability of teleportation. By the way, I actually liked that about him. But in this movie he has underground layers which would explain how he appeared out of nowhere around the camp when it was convenient to sneak up on college types studying each others anatomy for an important midterm. I highly rate this movie if you'd like a more realistic version of Jason. Please watch the older films too. It's a bloody good journey. And Bring the kids.",1383955200,,961,4.6923076923076925

235094,4,6300214087,"I have always been a huge fan of the Friday the 13th franchise. I even suffered through the more horrible ones just because there are several aspects to admire about the Voorhees way of killing. To me he has always been the ultimate killing machine and I have been very doubtful that anything can actually kill him once and for all. So when this movie was released I was actually very wary. Wary because I didn't want my favorite psycho killer to be turned into something he wasn't and make us Voorhees fans look even worse in the eyes of the Krueger/Myers fans. But this movie definitely made it's ends meet. It wasn't perfect by any means, which is why I didn't give it the 5 stars, but it is definitely worth the four it received from me. I found the character much more intimidating in this one, especially because you sometimes see the sense of urgency in making the kill, rather than stumble around slowly until he runs back into his victim. The movie to me was put together very well and I am hoping a second one is made in the near future.",1383350400,,1047,4.374358974358974

The original Hallloween was much more stylish and scary, but Jason will always be the progenitor of the real slasher villain.  Lots of fake blood (which still looks better than the CGI stuff you see everywhere now), lots of shocks, nudity... everything a real horror movie needed back then.

Sure it's all cliched now, but back then this was fresh stuff and is one of the few movies that nostalgia hasn't disappointed me.  It's not a great movie in and of itself, but for the memories and influence it's part of, this deserves the label of ""classic.""",1383177600,,636,4.552631578947368

235135,4,6300214087,"My review BEFORE seeing the other movies. Once I saw the Nightmare on Elm Street remake I figured after seeing that movie, this would be the most logical movie to see. So after giving it a view I came away satisfied but, I could tell unlike, Nightmare where I enjoyed almost everything about that film, this movie was more of just a fun time. Before you jump to conclusions, I did like the movie and enjoyed it, but it does have its flaws.

First the characters, while they did get good screen time and we get to know their personalities, I didn't form preticulary good attachments to them. When the death scenes occured I just thought, ""OHHHHH, hate to go out like that"" or ""whatever"" and in one case ""kinda random"". That last bitt also is important to mentione, the final two deaths are actually pretty random and dumb comapred to the other deaths, which all happened in a good way.

Next, the hints toward Jason's background really amount to nothing. It seems like they are put there to just reference the original series this movie was based on (haven't seen any, just know a few details from Scream).

The ending honestly sucked, it was obvious something like that would happen and was totally un needed.

Now remember I did enjoy the movie, the characters were good to watch, I was actually scared for myself this time (the reverse of Nightmare), the deaths were cool, Jason was menacing, great scenery, effects. But on the critique level, I have to give it three stars. I'll definutly pick it up however.

My review AFTER seeing the other movies. Now that I've seen the other moives, I feel this is one of the better films of the franchise. Unlike the original the film incorperates Jason's mother into the legend of Crystal Lake propeling us straight to Jason, which I was happy about. Turns out, I was right about the homoges to the other movies as I found out this is a combination of elements from the first four films. I still enjoyed these characters, however I'm in a fairly biased situation as the cast in this movie behave like people close to my age group (unlike the original film). I was pleased at how menacing and smart Jason was in this movie. Like with Leatherface in the remake I'd be scared of him just by looking at him.

Now dislikes were, Jason taking a hostage seemed odd to me, I've seen people claim there are 13 deaths in this movie but I only count 12. The last death still feels unneeded along with the ending. While I enjoy this cast, unlike most of the originals, I don't care for them too much. Finally, while I feel this is a good Friday the 13th movie, it still isn't that great of a movie. Basically the opposite of James Bond where most say even bad Bond movies are nice movies, here the good ones aren't that great still.",1382486400,,2763,4.4831013916500995
235136,2,6300214087,"Nothing irks me more, when a remake is made, and you hear that the people involved in such a lofty venture, 'sat down and watched all of the past movies'.

I have no idea if Michael Bay and Co. even bothered to do that, with regards to the Friday the 13th films. I will say that no one but a true Friday the 13th fan, should've been involved in  bringing this back to the big screen. And true fans don't actually need to sit down and watch them, because they already have, hundreds of times. They know the films by heart.

The problem with this particular movie, is that it is not so much a Friday the 13th film, as it is a 'Jared Padalecki Movie'.

Mr. Padalecki actually carries the film nicely, which shouldn't be a surprise, since honestly, he's doing nothing different than what his popular 'Supernatural' character, Sam Winchester, would do, if he had been in a similar situation. Maybe that's why he seemed to fit in so well in this film. But Jared Padalecki's 'fitting in', was also the problem here. Everything that happened in this movie, was tailored around his character. And three things happened that didn't happen in the other films, and certainly didn't improve the franchise.

1. This movie became a 'horror mystery'. Jared Padalecki's character is searching for answers that ultimately, only Jason  Voorhies can provide. All that was needed here, was to show a group of careless teens, looking to spend a weekend in the woods drinking beer and having sex.

2. Jason Voorhies was a little too...soft. Yes, he can wield an ax like no one else. But suddenly he's robbing homes on the lake so he can steal modern day devices, when he never needed modern day devices. He never stole kerosene and he had no  need for food that he didn't kill with his bare hands, himself. Also, Jared Padalecki was actually able to get in a few punches on the usually unflappable killer.

3. The police were just more heartbreakingly stupid than they usually are in these movies.  2-3 characters were able to find Jason's humble abode. And if they could do it, then the police could have. Before, Jason 'lived' in places that would have been accidentally found. And of course, if the police had not been so dense, Jared Padalecki's character would've had no need to even be up at Crystal Lake.

However, I gave this movie two stars because Jared Padalecki did carry it well. Unfortunately, his being in it caused it to be a different type of film, than the ones I'm used to. And that would've been fine, if I thought that anything that had been done in the way of improvement, with this film, had actually enhanced it. It did not. And the proof of that is that we have not seen a part two, thank God.",1382400000,,2695,4.5246913580246915
235137,2,6300214087,"Since the dawn of film there have been numerous movies that achieved impact through horrifying violence, but the so-called ""slasher film"" as we presently think of it pretty much originated with Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 PSYCHO, a movie that prompted a host of imitators like HOMOCIDAL and DEMENTIA 13. The genre seemed played out by the 1970s--but the 1978 HALLOWEEN scared the absolute hell out of everybody who saw it and made a fortune. Although it went further than most previous films, the violence in HALLOWEEN was largely implied. Then came FRIDAY THE 13TH, which went out of its way to be as bloody as possible. It was a new extreme and it drew a huge teenage audience. Made for less than $600,000 with a largely no-name cast, FRIDAY THE 13TH earned close to forty million dollars in its original release and spawned a seemingly endless series of sequels.

Like many another thriller, FRIDAY THE 13TH borrows a basic plot device from Agatha Christie's 1939 landmark novel TEN LITTLE INDIANS, in which a group of people are basically cut off from outside help and are then picked off one by one by a psychotic killer. In this instance, the location is the remote Camp Crystal Lake, a summer camp which has been closed for twenty years due to an unsolved double homocide and a generally unsavory reputation. Now the camp is to be re-opened, and several teenagers have been hired to get the place in shape and then act as camp counselors when the children arrive. The locals, however, warn the teens that no good will come of re-opening the camp ... and indeed, one of the teens is murdered before even reaching the camp. A heavy rainstorm cuts off the roads and yes, the teens are murdered one by one. The deaths are as gory as 1980 special effects allow, and the movie essentially rips off the ending of the 1976 CARRIE, the visual style of HALLOWEEN, and even Bernard Herrmann's famous score for PSYCHO.

The big problem with FRIDAY THE 13TH is that the script is stupid, the actors are terrible, and the production values would make a 1970s ""Television Movie of the Week"" seem first class. Betsy Palmer was a reasonably well known and highly skilled actress, but you'd never know it from this movie; Kevin Bacon, of course, would go on to a major career, but you can't anticipate it from anything he does here. As for the rest, well, the worst is probably Robbi Morgan, and it is a relief when she turns out to be the first victim in ""the present tense."" At the time, FRIDAY THE 13TH was a shocker--but today it is more campy than frightening. The DVD comes with several extras, including a few additional seconds of footage, a commentary, a reunion video and the like. I suppose old fans will groove on it, but frankly I used my fast forward a lot.

235138,1,6300214087,"I've only seen two of the 35 Jason movies in this abomination of a franchise: Jason goes to Hell and this one. These two films are easily the worst movies ever diarrheaed onto celluloid. There is nothing to like about this movie. NOTHING. The acting, the dialogue, the photography - all horrendous. But where this film really takes a dump is the plot. Nice twist at the end - an old lady with gingivitis, who couldn't kick my grandma's ass, is the killer. That's just extraordinary.

What other scares are in store for the viewer? Well there is the part when one of the annoying snot-noses pretends to drown, but doesn't. That kept me on the edge of my seat. Then there's the scene where there is a snake in the cabin and they actually kill it, in real life, with a machete for the sake of an awful, tasteless joke ('At least we know what's for dinner' hahahahaha - not funny). How does a movie this atrocious spawn so many sequels? What kind of simpleton retard would find this movie to have any redeeming qualities? It's embarrassing. Makes me ashamed of this country. It's hard to believe that Kubrick's 'The Shining' came out the same month as this movie.

While it didn't hit the mark for many fans it is far from the worst (that honor belongs to Jason Goes to Hell). I would rank it #8 in the 12 film canon. It is superior to the New Line F13 releases (not to mention the ill-fated New Beginning). The reboot is an encapsulation of Friday the 13th Part 1-3. Many fans groaned when it was released but it does get better on a repeat viewing. It has some great kills and nudity but it is surprisingly devoid of scares and suspense. Derek Mears does a great job as Jason (though Kane Hodder is still my favorite). You get two cuts of the film in this stand-alone Blu-ray release. A digital copy is also provided. The picture quality is amazing and the audio is almost as good. There is just over an hour of bonus content provided.

235141,2,6300214087,"Although there were some creative kills in this film, the story was almost non existent and the ""acting"" was like watching paint dry. Not only did I not care about any of the characters, I was hoping for them all to die quickly so I could get this over with.

Keep in mind I'm not even comparing it to the far superior original. If that were the case, I would reduce another star. As a stand alone horror flick it reeks of cliches and stereotypes. While some remakes (and, yes, I realize the producers want you to believe this isn't a remake. But it is, for all intents and purposes) bring something new to the table, this film did not. The characters were cardboard, Jason seemed better adept at jumping from behind things rather than being a merciless killer, and ,while the nudity was appreciated, it was there as filler.

Being that it was a Michael Bay film, I feared that the franchise was going to be ruined.  However, I was happy to see that the movie was quite decent in their protrail of Jason.  I still find the moving lacking however in terms of story.  While i understand this is a slasher remake, there is always the potential to make it better. Perfect example is Zombie's Halloween.  In that movie, Zombie worked on additional story line which built your understanding of how Michael is how he is.  This helped the viewer connect to the character.  For this movie, Bay didn't spend any time doing that and I think that was my only gripe on the movie.

235189,5,6300214087,"While the vast majority of reviews I have read make this film out to be anywhere from so-so to absolutely horrible, I totally disagree. As a fan of this franchise since the beginning, I really enjoyed the remake. There were no drastic deviations from the things I loved about the originals, they just put a fresh, modern spin on it. I especially love the inclusion of elements from the first four entries, and boiled it down into s ingle cohesive film. It will never replace the original films for me, but I feel no shame in sitting it beside them on my DVD shelf. In it's favor, the acting and writing are much better than the first Friday flic, and the film makers masterfully give us a new Friday worthy of the name. As a whole, the franchise is about Jason, who barely appears in the original film, and doesn't get the iconic hockey mask until the third film. The remake acknowledges all these stages but stays focused on Jason. The backstory remains unchanged except for the update, and the remaining connections to the first entries in the film's story are seamlessly woven into the new story. It feels to me less like a remake, and more like another chapter that happens to include the elements of the original version.
Critics are quick to point out the ridiculous flaws in the characters actions and the plot points, but I believe the wrong criteria are being used to rate this film. Don't get me wrong, I love the film, and the horror/slasher genre, but this isn't trying to be anything but entertaining. It's no Silence of the Lambs, but it isn't trying to be. I can acknowledge some of the critiques voiced about the film, but it wasn't anything that distracted me from enjoying this for what it is. A bunch of kids getting hacked up by a mythic, iconic villain in between rampant use of drugs, alcohol and promiscuous sex is not a story that is trying to win accolades for its artistic merits. However, if that is the sort of film you want to watch, this remake delivers. So don't believe the bad reputation this film has received from some. And if you enjoyed this one, check out the originals to see how they honored the spirit of those films while updating Friday the 13th for a new generation of horror fans.",1378598400,,2225,4.523573200992556

235246,3,6300214087,"While I agree that the original version was a classic, I wasn't so in love with it that I couldn't appreciate the idea of a remake/revamp. The problem is, part of what made the original fun was the time period (campy 80s horror) and that it never really took itself seriously. It had some good frights in it, but ultimately was just there to have a good time.

The revamp tries very hard to accomplish the same feeling but only partially succeeds. It's something I'd recommend to fans of horror, particularly the slasher fans, but it's not really anything that truly stands out. It's a little frustrating since the components are here, but just seem to fall short somehow. I can't help but feel that this was hampered by the fact it's a FtT flick and as such, tried so hard to bring something new to the table while still clinging to what people are expecting from anything associated with the series.

However that said, there are some great moments to this film- the ending being one of them. The final scene was pretty darn cool and showed how the creative team could reimagine parts of the original film while still putting a newish spin on things. The chase scenes were decent as well and there's some nice tension during some of the scenes. It's just that at the same time I couldn't help but feel that this film was fairly overly long and that some elements dragged on a little longer than they should.

So in the end would I recommend it? Sure. It's sort of meh, but it's a lot better than some give it credit for. As long as you go into this not expecting much and not overly comparing it to its predecessor, you'll be OK. It's better than some of the other Jason films, for what that's worth.

235250,5,6300214087,"Though following in the footsteps of 1978's Halloween, Friday the 13th is every bit as important to the history of the sub genre of horror known as the slasher genre (even if neither were the first of it's kind). Halloween was of course a smash hit with both audiences and critics, but it was Friday the 13th that solidified the popularity of the genre, and from the moment Friday the 13th was released the genre couldn't be stopped. There's nothing like a good 80's slasher.

Steve Christy and 7 counselors are in the process of re opening Camp Crystal Lake (which people in town have nicknamed Camp Blood) despite the camp's bad history (which include a drowning of a young boy and the unsolved murder of two teen counselors). Soon enough a mysterious killer shows up and slowly stalks the counselors one by one. Who is the killer? And will anybody survive the long night at camp blood?
Friday the 13th is the first film in one of the longest enduring and greatest horror series of all time . It may come off a bit like a prequel to audiences today, but this is where it all began, and all is the better for it. From it's fantastic camp setting (which jumps from quiet and peaceful during the day, to eerie and ominous at night) to the film's top notch and gruesome gore effects done by effects legend Tom Savini, it's easy to see why Friday the 13th has help up all these years later, why it's gotten all the sequels it deserves, and why the fanbase for the series continues to grow today. Everything just clicks from day 1.
The acting here is overall pretty good! Kevin Bacon makes his film debut in a supporting role playing one of the more horny counselors, and his death scene has been a showstopper ever since the movies debut in 1980. Another interesting cast member here is Harry Crosby who's actually one of the sons of the one and only Bing Crosby. He plays Bill, who's one of the more likable counselors in the film. Though despite having a future A lister, and a pop culture icon's offspring, the film really belongs to our two leading ladies Betsy Palmer and Adrienne King. King plays the first of one of the many final girl's the series has had, and she's right up there with the very best. She's strong willed and vunerable all in one, and carries the film very well. Betsy Palmer plays the legendary Pamela Voorhees. And even if she may only have about 20 minutes of screentime, she has a profound effect on the series, and is one of the genre's most memorable characters. Palmer plays her role perfectly, and leaves quite the lasting impression.

Overall Friday the 13th is a suspenseful and gory slasher classic.

The kills were all well done and the action sequences were intense. I used some of the scenes for inspiration in a table top game I was writing. The actor who played Jason was simply phenomenal. He was big, he was fast, and he was scary. Very very cool. The other actors did a good job as well. I loved all the characters and loved to hate a few of them. All the more reason to applaud when they got dismembered.

This movie may not be good for purists but I felt it was a fun and worthy addition to the franchise.

235298,5,6300214087,"""Friday The 13th"" is great! This is how the story goes: Searching for his missing sister, Clay Miller heads up to the eerie woods of legendary Crystal Lake, where he stumbles on the creaky remains of rotting old cabins behind moss-covered trees. And that's not the only thing lying in wait under the brush. Against the advice of police and cautions from the locals, Clay pursues what few leads he has in the search for his missing sister, Whitney, with the help of Jenna, a young woman he meets among a group of college kids up for an all-thrills weekend. But they are all about to find much more than they bargained for. Little do they know, they've entered the domain of one of the most terrifying specters in American film history -- the infamous killer who haunts Crystal Lake, armed with a razor-sharp machete... Jason Voorhees.

The cast led by Jared Padalecki (as Clay) & Danielle Panabaker (as Jenna) is great! The directing by Marcus Nispel (who also directed ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (2003) is great! The story (based on characters by Victor Miller) by Damian Shannon, Mark Swift (both wrote the story and screenplay to ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" (2003), & Mark Wheaton (who also wrote the screenplay to ""The Messengers"" (2007) and the screenplay by Shannon & Swift is great!

The music by Steve Jablonsky (who also did the music to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Amityville Horror"" (2005), ""The Island"" (2005), ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"" (2006), ""The Hitcher"" (2007), ""Transformers"" (2007) & the upcoming ""Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen"" (2009) is excellent! The cinematography by Daniel C. Pearl (who also did the cinematography to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974 & 2003), & ""AVPR: Aliens Vs. Predator - Requiem"" (2007) is excellent! The film editing by Ken Blackwell (who was an first assistant editor on ""The Island"" & associate editor on ""Transformers"" is great!

The costume design by Marian Ceo (who also did the costume design to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"") is great!

235299,5,6300214087,"Friday The 13th is a good, classic, and sometimes cheesy slasher film that started many of the typical horror movie cliches that we know about today.

The movie is about a bunch of teenagers who are going to Camp Crystal Lake, but all the adults in town say the place is dangerous and has a death curse. The teenagers are then stalked and killed one by one by a woman who wants revenge. Years ago, her son Jason drowned in the lake, and the counselors weren't paying attention, they were making love while the boy drowned. Near the end, we see the woman named Pamela Voorhees stalking the main character. While Pamela is stalking Alice, Pamela speaks in her normal voice, and in her son's voice. When speaking in her son's voice, she keeps saying ''Kill her''.

It's a good horror film, but you have to watch it at night, because it is a dark film and some parts are hard to see if watched during the day.",1369180800,,905,4.380952380952381

235301,3,6300214087,"This review, especially the next comment is from a guy who grew up on Jason and has been in a fist fight because someone said ""Jason movies suck."" I loved this movie!! It is so old school it isn't even funny. Now all you people who badmouth the movie (much like you did for the remakes of Halloween & Texas Chainsaw) have either A: Never seen the other movies, or B: Have no idea what Jason is all about. Jason movies are about cheap scares, nudity, blood and gore. That's it, end of story.

They're not meant to be classical, epic landmarks like ""Lord of the Rings"" or even the ""Godfather"" movies. It's meant to scare you, show you some naked people and gross you out with the gore. This movie does all of those things. Now, the story is very different in a lot of ways, than the previous Jason flicks. He's back at Camp Crystal Lake (thank God) but this movie is the first 4 originals through the magic of science able to make a new ""Frankenstein"" of sorts, throw him in a lake and then when he's P'd off, the fun starts. Simple. The new elements are 1: Jason can think, he's not a mindless killer anymore, 2: The explanation of how Jason can get from point A to point B without you seeing him do it, 3: Smarter teens and 4: A good, realistic story.

Some parts I didn't like much at the beginning, but as the movie progressed I caught myself hating things for no reason other than the fact that they were new ideas. The only things I don't like about his one, and will not change my mind are how small Jason is compared to the previous films, and the fact that yet again, Kane Hodder isn't playing Jason. Other than that, it's fine!!

There's lots of scares & shock, lots of blood & gore, and even some nakedness!! I guess all I have to say is that if you give this one a chance, it's good. But if you don't let yourself like it then you won't. I recommend it for fans of gore, Jason, nudity and Horror / Slasher movies.

And for everybody else . . . well, the verdict is that this movie may be fun, but trash.

To each their own, I'm sure.

So as for this product itself, it is a DVD that contains a copy of a movie that presumably you enjoy or predict you will enjoy (or maybe you just enjoy reading reviews of movies you don't like).

Mine traveled half way round the world so there would have been some movement inside the box and all the discs are perfect. I've worked with DVD's for 15 odd years and I can see no real problem with the packaging at all. It's possible that Paramount have addressed the issue and changed it as I can't see how the soft, smooth cardboard could scratch the DVD's (it's no different to Warner's Friends Collection Box and the same as Fox's Simpsons Seasons). It's also possible that (for some customers) the DVD's were scratched before they were even put in the packaging (seen this plenty of times) and Amazon just happened to get a/the bad batch.

I really would have like to see them expand on the Pamela Voorhees angle than just drop Jason in our laps the way that they did. It really would have been in great Friday tradition.

I did like the kill sequences, they were quite crafty and kept my attention, but other than that, this movie totally falls flat.

Released in 1980, this splatter flick helped to usher in the modern horror films of the late 1970's and 1980s. At the time of its release, it was both revered and feared for its realistic portrayal of murder. It was one of the first films in the history of movies to feature such graphic and gory violence. It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, though the killer in this first installment is his mother, Pamela. Often imitated, the original Friday the 13th popularized a number of themes and techniques in the genre: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die.

The Package (worth no star)

Yes, like other viewers mentioned in their reviews, the packaging of this boxset sucks.  I could even discover  a tiny drop of glue stick to my first disc.  Worst of all , the inner side of the folder was made of a rubber-liked material.  It was so difficult for me to take out individual disc, and once I took it out I really didn't want to put it back again.
The only interesting thing with the package is the studio print out some interesting facts that hardcore fans might want to know.

The Content (worth 5 stars)

OK, we have a very disappointed package, however,  this collection is consist of the Uncut version of the First movie and the deluxe edition of the rest of theseries., which you couldn't find in the market.  The first highly appraised Boxset(5 Disc set) is the compilation of all the thearitical released of the movies.  Another collection set is only consist the first four movies of the series, although it is the delux version.  Therefore, if you want to have a full set of the movies with quite a number of extras, you should get this 6-Disc set or you may want to wait for the blu ray.

The supplemental features on all movies  include commentary and the making footages.  I break down the details as follows:

PACKAGE
If you are anything like me you have read the reviews about the terrible package causing the dvds to scratch. Me personally, I can tell where it ""might"" be a problem but I didn't have any with it. I was on the fench if I should get it because of all those bad reviews but there were also good ones so I figured I would roll the dice. And Im happy as a hockey mask wearing maniac finding a machete ;) Also, side note. The dvds are in a book like case, which comes in another cardboard type case/cover. Pretty awesome look to it but its not made of metal so you cant throw it around and expect it to stay together. BUT for the price you cant get much better.

The Films
Like them all, like only some, either way you cant lose. For the price of 35 bucks, you get 8 films! If you buy them apart, *new* it would run you 80 dollars. And they aren't just regular dvds, each dvd is the deluxe copy so they have a cabin load of extras!!

Final Words, Im not going to review each film on here. If you are looking at getting this item you don't need a break down of each film. In a nut shell, if you are a fan or wanting to see the whole series because your new to it go with this hands down. I give it 4 out of 5.

Pros
+ 8 films for 35 bucks!!
+ Cool Package with 3D glasses marked up with Friday the 13th part 3D logo!!
+ Awesome 8 page books telling, weapons in each film, number of kills, fun facts!!
+ Doesnt include Jason X.
+ Lots of extras on each deluxe film

Cons
-Doesnt include Jason Goes To Hell (I already own)
-Doesnt include Remake Of Friday The 13th (which I loved, but I already own)
-Would have rather each film come in its own dvd box like the old days.

Any questions, post them. I will answer them.",1351814400,5,1761,3.9604519774011298
235460,4,6300214087,"After eleven movies and countless different visions of Jason Voorhees, I feel that the Friday the 13th series was in desperate need of a remake.  With the introduction of the twelfth film, I feel as if they may have finally settled on one identity; a Jason that solidifies everything frightening: a motivated killer with speed, strength, vision, and an apparent knowledge of electrical work.

This remake establishes some minor, but interesting, issues with Jason's origin.  Including how Jason came to own his iconic Hockey mask.  Also, by including some supernatural elements and giving purpose to his murdering rampage, Jason becomes much scarier.  Although this is a remake, there are many new facets to Jason that some may find interesting (die-hard fans may find it distasteful).

This film is supposed to be a combination of the first four films, which could have ended up a disaster; however, the team behind this remake does a fine job at compressing some of the elements into this movie.  This includes a backstory of the first film, which doesn't take longer than five minutes. Further grounding the story, the team made Jason much more personable (i.e. they show how he manages to live off the land).

The plot, which is deeper than most of the other films, follows Clay (Jared Padalecki) as he searches for his sister who has gone missing near Camp Crystal Lake.  Along the way, Clay meets a group of teens that plan on spending their weekend partying near Crystal Lake.  Here he befriends Jenna (Danielle Panabaker) and their search commences to find Clay's sister.  The other teens are mostly forgettable, with the exception of actor Aaron Yoo, who really steals the film with his quirky sense of humor.

The remake DOES include tons of sex, violence and drugs, all of which are elements of the series, so if you have children in the house, I would wait until they went to bed to watch this one. Meanwhile, the kills are pretty sub-standard within the genre, with the exception of two or three memorable ones.

Overall, this series excels due to a great director and a good cast.  The acting is all reasonably well done, the man who plays Jason (Derek Mears) really shines, he makes his character feel like more than just a prop.  One of the best features this film establishes is Jason's ability to run.  Not only does he run, he full on sprints after his soon to be victims.  This feature is intense and horrifying.  On the down side, apparently somewhere along the line Jason established himself as an experienced electrician (you'll know what I mean when you see the film) and expert at the long bow.

I give this film four out of five stars.",1351814400,,2661,4.770742358078603
235461,1,6300214087,"My girlfriend and I decided we wanted to watch a movie that we haven't seen before.  We caved and rented it for $3.  We both agree that the best part was when Kevin showed that girl his bacon.
But really, this movie was more fun to make fun of and laugh at than scare us.  Lots of the kills were ""Who are you?"" and then *stab*.",1350864000,,327,3.9242424242424243
235530,3,6300214087,"Love this film!!! Saw it with my best friend in 1980 when I was only 16 years old. Not going to get into the plot-what horror movie fan isn't familiar with it by now? For years I would mock some VERY SMALL aspects of this film. Betsy Palmer as Mrs Vorhees goes a bit over the top with her grand dame/Hollywood golden age style of acting. Also Adrienne King as Mrs Vorhees' final ALMOST VICTIM couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Otherwise, very good,solid acting from the rest of the cast,tight direction & pacing add up to a classic low budget little horror film. Now I'm going to sit down on the couch,relax & watch part 2. IMO,The only sequel in the series worth giving 95 minutes of my time to.",1350864000,,703,4.253731343283582

235535,5,6300214087,"The original Friday The 13th is a horror cult classic all the way! This is the best and only good film in the series,in my opinion. Ms. Voorhees was so much more creepier than Jason. The storyline in this film is by far the best,compared to the other ""Friday"" movies too. There was absolutley no need for any sequels. The rest just got too dumb and unrealistic. THIS is the ONLY ""Friday The 13th"" movie that you wanna watch and own.",1348185600,3,432,4.345679012345679

235571,4,6300214087,"I have fond memories of seeing this film as an impressionable fifteen-year-old during it's original theatrical release.  Cheesy by today's standards, it still holds its place as a trend-setter in the slasher film craze which seemed to bloom in the 1980's.  Manfredini's wonderful music score nearly steals the show in my opinion, but Savini's grisly effects, good editing, and convincing acting by Betsey Palmer all add up to a campfire tale of terror which has somehow reached legendary status.  Without specifically giving away any spoilers to the uninitiated, I still feel that it is misleading and inappropriate, (though understandable in marketing terms), to associate the Jason hockey mask image with the first film.  I love the original poster design and would prefer to see it consistently used.",1344297600,,803,5.299212598425197

235573,5,6300214087,First off this is way better than Jason Goes To Hell and secondly its a good solid horror movie.

235574,5,6300214087,"I recently purchased this boxed set from a store that sells used DVDs. Although my collection was used and packaged in the 'horrible' cardboard packaging, my discs are fine and play just fine. Shopping frequently at a used DVD store has taught me the valuable lesson that a scratched DVD will still play. Also, despite buying it in used condition, the scratches were pretty minimal. If you buy this collection new, then I'm sure your scratches will be hardly noticeable: certainly, they will be no worse than the average day to day scratches that you put on your other DVDs. As long as you are a person who cares about your movies, and you give just a little TLC when you slide the discs in and out of the box, then this is a great buy and I would not wait to experience this awesome collection.",1343952000,4,795,4.4520547945205475
235575,5,6300214087,"Lemme first say that I'm not much of a fan of the wave of remakes that have been plagued our theatres for the past decade. One here and there never hurt anybody, but when the majority is all remakes it makes us horror fans want to slap hollywood in the face and demand some originality. This Friday the 13th remake, however, I can forgive because I don't view it as a remake at all. Jason wasn't even in the original! And he didn't get his hockey mask till part 3 and the story line and characters in this one is different than all the others. The point that I'm trying to make is, this movie doesn't take away from the intergrity of the rest of the franchise because it is not simply replicating any past movie like, say Rob Zombie's Halloween did. It's its own movie. And there's some hot chicks in this movie too, which is always a plus!",1343779200,2,840,4.25625
235576,2,6300214087,"It's a well made film, good gore, kills and all that. but I don't know, there seems to be something missing. Kind of a empty copy of the old films... like they watched the old ones and just copied it without the 'feeling' of the old ones. Not that the originals were deep films or anything, but they still had something that this one is missing. Nice to see Jason again though, and the guy playing him does a good job.",1343433600,,418,4.172839506172839
235577,5,6300214087,"I have been a lifelong Friday the 13th fan and when I heard that they were remaking it, I wasn't scared at all, it is a formula that is kind of hard to screw up.  This attempt is not perfect and suffers some of the problems that most modern horror movies do (too much CG & too many ""stars"") but overall I think that it did a good job.  Some people complained about some of the weapons Jason used... I think that that is stupid and if you pay attention it actually makes perfect sense.  I haven't watched it in a while, but writing about it now makes me want to, it delivers on what it is supposed to - mindless sex and violence wrapped around a core of a morality play, those who misbehave get punished.  This was a good movie and a good DVD worthy of the Voorhees family.",1341619200,2,772,4.0927152317880795
235578,5,6300214087,"SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is truly one of the best horror movies of the 80's (yes,better than A Nightmare On Elm Street and Halloween). It contains good characters and atmosphere. I still get goosebumps by it to this day. I was surprised as the movie starts off with a girl named Annie and I thought she was going to be the main character, but she gets killed off right off the bat. I think Betsy Palmer is great as Pamela Voorhees (who only did this movie to get a new car). But there's one thiong I still don't get. The dvd I got came with a holographic package on the movie but it has a hockey mask! Pamela doesn't even wear a mask! In fact, the mask isn't worn until Part 3. All in all, I believe this is the best in the series. I'll watch in any day.

But when I saw this, I just couldn't stomach it. Now it wasn't exactly a movie I hated with a passion, but it's definitely only a one-time watch for me. If you're familiar with the old Jason, you probably won't like this - obviously. They had a few of the same kills as they've already done in the original movies, which I thought was really lazy. I mean, a part of the film maker's favorite things to do with the series was create NEW and INNOVATIVE deaths amongst the characters. Not to mention, Jason decides to keep one of the campers chained up in his house and not even kill her... yeah, right. Like Mr. Voorhees would be caught dead letting anyone live. I don't know, I guess I just need to stick to the old movies. That doesn't mean I'm gonna pass up on making fun of the sequel when it comes out though. Not a chance.",1340150400,4,960,4.2228260869565215

235671,4,6300214087,"After all the history, it's good to get back to basics sometimes.  I hadn't seen this flick in years - I may never have seen it all the way through.  I knew the storyline, knew the ending, but kind of looked down my nose at the whole franchise as derivitive and unimaginitive.  In the long run, the series has its faults, but this first film actually has a lot more going for it than I remembered.

Most of the young actors here are just average, but they aren't unbelieveable, as so many characters are in generic slasher flicks.  We know they're going to get it, but none of them are stupidly walking into trouble, unless you count Annie, who foolishly hitches a ride with anyone who'll give her a lift.  That sort of thing was already a no-no by the late seventies, but it gets the story moving along, I guess.  Otherwise, the rest of the counselors are (understandably) unaware that anything's wrong until they get sliced and diced.  Besty Palmer, as Mrs. Vorhees, is actually even pretty creepy in a grandmotherly way, especially when she starts channeling Jason.

There's also a cool retro feel to the film for me, having been not much younger than these kids when the movie first came out.  And something I would never have noticed at the time was the flick's soundtrack.  I'm really surprised at how good it was, and how well it sets the tone for the picture.

Obviously there are a lot of qualities here, otherwise you couldn't spawn a franchise like Jason has, but if you haven't seen it in a long time, it might be time to revisit.  In my case, it wasn't really how I remembered it at all.  It was better.",1339459200,,1616,4.4523809523809526

Jason kidnaps Whitney because she bears some resemblance to his Mother. I had a real problem with that. Since when did Jason Voorhees ever, ever take anyone prisoner? That just didn't work for me. Derek Mears is great as Jason, props to the man, he did a fantastic job! But the story unraveled when it was discovered Jason had taken this young woman prisoner. Uncharacteristic behavior from the man in the hockey mask is the reason for my negativity towards this film.

If they do another film (which I don't think they will) I would get another director and a storyline more in-line with the characteristics of its star character.",1337385600,3,745,4.687022900763359

But it has a couple of major design flaws which result in the ruination of your discs. Now, these tray designs are even worse than Avatar and Star Wars. At least those had their own cardboard trays that slid out to retrieve the discs. These discs lay right in the cardboard sleeve. The second part of the design flaw is the spine. I know they were trying to make this a slim case, but they went too far! The spine is so narrow that everything is pressed together very hard to get the pages back into the slipcase. The pages are literally bent around the discs, which only makes the sleeve they're in even tighter and that much harder to get out. All 8 of my discs were scratched upon arrival. Sorry, gotta go back. I think the slim cases, from the Jason New Line Collection, are the way to go.

I love how the kids are natural looking and fresh faced and not overly made up, like in the original 4 Fridays, but at the same time still modern. I love all the tips of that hat to the first four films, and how they packed it all into this one film WITH CARE. Now we get to Jason : This movie BELONGS to Derek Mears(who played Jason). I could write a very long review of all the wonderful things he does, but instead, Ill just tell you to see the film. Every time I watch it I see more and more wonderful things in it !

What I'd like to see on a future release is more alternate takes of Derek Mears playing Jason. I know he has said that he did homages to the earlier Jasons in some takes, but that some of it did not get used. I'd like to see these(if they're not going to give us more Derek by making a Friday 2, then they should at least give us these alternate takes ! pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease !!!! ).

235678,5,6300214087,"I think Friday the 13th is a great slasher and a classic that hasn't lost its power after 32 years. I have a huge admiration for this movie. It uses a very basic premise and formula but still manages to have its own unique style due to clever execution. As the producer and the writer openly admits, it was supposed to be a ripoff from Halloween. They basically used the same structure and formula. But thanks to clever use of camera, brilliant special effects of Tom Savini, awesome score of Harry Manfredini, beautiful art direction of Virginia Field, the movie becomes alive and grabs you from start to finish. It just goes to show that just because an idea is not original, doesn't necessarily mean the movie would fail. It all depends on the execution and cinematic style. I'd use this movie as an example to show all producers and directors how you can take a simple idea and turn it to success.

I saw this movie when I was a young kid and before I saw Halloween and I couldn't tell that it was a ripoff and I certainly cannot tell you whether this Blu-ray version would fail to meet your expectation for reasons some reviewers have stated here. However, I can tell you that the video and audio quality are excellent. Camp Crystal Lake has never been more crystal clear. I enjoyed all of the extras on the DVD (I cannot compare to previous releases as this is the only copy I ever own). I truly enjoyed the Renuion of the cast members (the camera use at the panel was amateurish; that's my only criticism). The interviews with the writer, producer Sean S. Cunningham were all great and insightful.

If you are fan of the horror genre, and not too picky about 80s feel (as I know the new generation has hard-time accepting older movies due to their era-specific feel), you will definitely enjoy this Blu-ray edition.",1334620800,9,1822,4.5349544072948325
235679,4,6300214087,"This is one of the first ""gory"" slasher flicks to come into play! I will give credit to ""Twitch of the Death Nerve (A.K.A. Bay of Blood)"" for being on of the very, very first movies to have as much bloody gore that it did and although this film is a great cult classic and is the film that starts off my favorite slasher franchise it still is filled to the top with pointless scenes that only Tom Savini's effects, Betsy Palmer's performance, and the genuine atmosphere this film alone gives off can save!

Plot: Camp Crystal Lake 1958, two necking teenagers were brutally killed, 1962, the camp was to be re-opened but the water was bad, now it is the present day (and when I mean present I mean the year this was filmed) and the camp is being opened yet again by a man with vision, Steve Christy who is played by Peter Brouwer.... Now all of the sudden the 7 camp councilors (and yes I included Annie) are being slaughtered one by one and none of them know about the murders until there is only one person left... Alice and the killer shall come into play but if you've seen this movie before you would know that *MAJOR SPOILER ALERET *Mrs. Voorhees* is killing to avenge her son *Jason Voorhees'* death! *END SPOILER*

Review: This is the horror flick that every other slasher film wanted to be! The special effects (which were superbly done by Tom Savini) were gruesomely blood-filled and creatively fun even if the sound effects didn't quite match the impact of the infamous axe kill and when the decapitation came into play it was poorly done but looked great even if it was more of a head-knocked-off then a head-cut-off! The acting was, well.... let's just leave it to Alice's reaction from finding the axe in the bed. ""What is going on?"" that cracks me up every time no matter how suspenseful the film is becoming. This reviewer however was massively pleased by the fact that this film was a huge box office success making a little over $39 million out of its $550,000 budget! This film has a great woodsy atmosphere to it as well.... the whole camp in the woods in the summer during the day was creepy enough but when night time came into play it was dark, grim and wet (A.K.A. a lot of so-called rain when really it was most likely just a guy spraying water into the air from behind the camera)! The whole film... it just worked and it has a great vibe that will always stick in the viewer's memory!

Acting: The acting was decent in some parts but I felt the actors could've done more. Kevin Bacon's lines such as ""That lightening will tear down the sky like a son of a gun"" were cheesy and forgettable... hell; I don't even remember what that line truly was.... I am just going off memory!

Gore: Aw yeah... here we go! We get an axe to the face, an arrow through the neck, a few slit throats, a hunting knife to the stomach, that infamous decapitation and some more! It went all out with the blood and it created atmosphere as well which in my opinion is extremely difficult to do, combining gore and atmosphere is like trying to create a vintage horror movie in this day and age.... it is incredibly hard!

Bottom Line: Cheesy, Gory, Terrifying, and A Helluva Ride! The beginning makes you think... aw it won't be to gory and then as it starts to kick in, even though it is cheesy, it graphically sets up death scenes and vividly creates an environment that is peaceful and friendly until around the twenty minute mark!

Suggested MPPA: Rated R for strong bloody violence, terror, sexuality, and some language

235770,3,6300214087,"Friday the 13th(1980) is a classic slasher horror film. The reviews for the film have been good and bad. One of my movie books gave it a ""turkey""! This first film in the series is directed by Sean S. Cunningham from a script by Victor Miller. The music score by Harry Mandredini sounds just as good as any Bernard Herrmann score. The ""bad guy"" in the film is Pamela Voorhees(Betsy Palmer). She goes insane after the Camp Crystal Lake counselors abuse her son Jason and let him drown in the lake. Jason Voorhees doesn't start killing people until Friday the 13th Part 2(1981). Adrienne King plays Alice, the film's heroine.
Robbi Morgan plays a cute, bubbly brunette who is killed off 30 minutes into the movie! Tom Savini(Dawn of the Dead) did a good job designing the make up and gore effects. Friday the 13th has a fair amount of blood and guts, but it's tame compared to the sequels, the 2009 remake, and the recent ""torture-porn horror movies"". Friday the 13th is full of creepiness and atmosphere. It was well-made considering its low budget. It tries to emulate films such as Psycho(1960), Carrie(1976) and Halloween(1978). Nothing supernatural happens in Friday the 13th(1980) until the climax. A young Kevin Bacon plays a camp counselor. Siskel and Ebert were big detractors of the Friday the 13th film series. They showed a clip from this film on their TV special Women in Danger. Around 1980, they were sick and tired of reviewing slasher/horror movies on a weekly basis. Friday the 13th does have some filler scenes such as Alice making a cup of coffee or someone fixing a car. The film is honest about the fact that it didn't have any ""A-list movie stars"" at the time. Most of the credits are saved for the end of the film.
Paramount Pictures distributed Friday the 13th in the U.S.A. while Warner Bros. distributed the film in foreign countries.
Friday the 13th(1980) is a solid horror film that spawned many sequels, a remake, and a bunch of rip offs.",1331683200,2,1965,4.698550724637681

235772,4,6300214087,"This is my first review of a product bought from amazon, So I will keep it short and sweet.
First off it has the worst packaging ever. Each disk is in a tight cardboard type sleeve in a book form type case. Each page has different little facts about that particular movie, which i thought was cool. You have to be very careful pulling out the dvds because there very tight. What i did to keep them from getting scratched by taking them in and out of the tight space was to put each movie in a dvd sleeve and put each movie with sleeve back in each slot, now you don't need to worry about scratches they slide straight out.
This could have been remedied by putting each dvd in its on case, like the nightmare on elm street boxset and maybe made each dvd when put together make a hockey mask or somthing but they went cheap i guess.
Now as far as the dvds go the quality of all are great  on ps3 upconverted. Only part 1 is uncut and it only 10 seconds extra. There are 2 pair of 3d glasses for part 3.  Each dvd has its on special features, wish there were more but they were ok.
Bottom line for the price as long as you take your time to take your dvds out and don't scratch them up you will love this boxset . You will still need to go bye part 9 and 10 as well as freddy vs jason and the remake to have the whole collection. if packaging was better would have givin a 5 rating.",1329264000,10,1379,3.9927536231884058

I snuck a peak at the performance before ours and saw the head decapitation scene and thought it was so great (I was 12). Year's later my brother feel ill and my relationship with Monette dissipated into nothing. Life just is that way.

235776,4,6300214087,"This film doesn't have that 80s film style and feeling; it's a different picture than the Friday the 13th films from the 80s. If you're getting it because you want it to resemble the older films in the series, you might be disappointed. There's nothing complicated about the story, and it has some great intense soundtracks. However, some won't like it for many reasons. Aside from the fact that it has a more modern film style, some people may think that the characters are uninteresting. Another thing that may disappoint people is the lack of over the top extreme gore. Don't get me wrong, the film has some scenes that are bloody, intense, and violent; but it doesn't have anything that I would consider extremely gory. The movie begins quickly with a group being killed off very early in the film, but these particular scenes lack gore. After this, the film begins to move at a decent pace. Depending on whether or not you like the characters or Marcus Nispel's directing, the film may either be fun or boring in between the violence; and even if you liked Nispel's TEXAS CHAINSAW remake, that doesn't mean you'll like this film because his directing is different here. The film basically takes place at the camp, so there's some good atmosphere and scenery here. The body count is high, and it delivers in terms of sex and nudity. There's no full frontal scenes, but it has some good topless scenes. It also has a very hard R rated sex scene with Julianna Guill. This scene has both topless and a little rear nudity and is purely for exploitation; she's one of the best looking women ever in a horror flick like this.  I didn't really care that much for this movie the first time I saw it, but it gets much better with repeated viewings.

The quality should've been a little brighter, but it looks very good overall. This regular DVD doesn't have any interesting animated menus screens. They should've done a better job with this and made the menu and chapter stops animated. The menu screen and chapter stops are plain without any animation.",1327104000,2,2048,4.654696132596685

Many people complained about this film, but it was exactly what I wanted it to be. A hockey masked maniac murdering young people just for being within the boundaries of what he considers his territory. I would recommend this film more to fans of slasher films who are not that familiar with the originals, just for the factor that most 'fan-boys' despise this film without any real reasoning...

That's not to say though that this is a good movie. It starts off pretty good, setting up Camp Blood and everything, but Cunningham doesn't have much directorial flair. This one's pretty dead. Basically no character development. Even things of marginal interest, like Alice and Steve's relationship, are only suggested and then dropped. One thing I noticed watching it this time around was that they really fouled up on the heroine. She's really bland, and they would've done better making one of the other girls the heroine.

Now the film is iconic, has some memorable images, a great location, and is atmospheric. It's too bad there wasn't more intelligence behind it.",1326412800,,840,4.874125874125874
235811,3,6300214087,"The late film critic Gene Siskel was so angry when FRIDAY THE 13TH came out that he wrote really distasteful words to describe producer/director Sean S. Cunningham. Not only that, he actually published the mailing address of the only known star in the movie: Betsy Palmer, asking readers to express their contempt for this movie. Roger Ebert knew the tirade against Cunningham was a bum rap, because he had actually met the man. He even gave a 4-star review of his earlier work as a producer (Wes Craven's 1971 film THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT). He hated this movie as much as Siskel and wondered why such a nice man would make such a despicable movie. Having seen FRIDAY THE 13th many times since 1984 as well as all the follow-up films, I feel both of these critics were really overreacting. I actually watched their old SNEAK PREVIEWS special titled ""Women in Danger"", where they attacked FRIDAY THE 13TH for something that I felt was a quality in the movie.

Even if you have never seen FRIDAY THE 13TH, you are familiar with the movie. In 1957 a young boy drowned at Camp Crystal Lake: a summer camp on the East Coast. One year later, two counselors were brutally murdered. The camp was closed down. 22 years later the town of Crystal Lake believes that the camp has a curse. The Cristy family who had founded the camp went broke, but the youngest member, Steve, intended to reopen it. He hires 7 camp counselors to help out. But on Friday the 13th, somebody begins murdering the counselors one by one, until only one of them is left. She learns the truth about who the killer is, which is connected to the boy who drowned, and has to fight for her own life before she winds up defeating the killer.

I will not reveal who the killer turns out to be because that is one of the surprises in this movie. Siskel and Ebert criticized that the whole movie shows the POV of the killer, as if that were making it a contempt for women. They praised HALLOWEEN because we see the killer early on. Not to criticize HALLOWEEN in any way, since it is also a great horror movie, but when the killer's identity is revealed in FRIDAY THE 13TH you are surprised that this person is the one responsible. By not showing who the killer is until we're supposed to know it actually adds to the intensity.

Betsy Palmer was the only known star in this movie. She was a well known star on television in the 1950's who mainly took the movie for financial reasons. One of the actors became a big-time Hollywood star: Kevin Bacon. He has one of the three best untimely demises in the movie.(It is amazing that a whole lot of the actors who did FRIDAY THE 13TH movies have had successful movie and television careers.

The person who is really the biggest star is the F/X makeup wizard: Tom Savini. He actually creates convincing illusions of the characters being horribly murdered. The Blu-Ray edition has a featurette on how he did those amazing effects. However, I think a more detailed explanation can be found the the deluxe hardcover book about the FRIDAY THE 13TH franchise: CRYSTAL LAKE MEMORIES. Although this movie is certainly more bloody and violent than John Carpenter's original HALLOWEEN, the way Savini is able to depict the murders is really creative.

I would like to add another thing. One of the criticism's of the FRIDAY THE 13TH films is that the characters are so stupid they are set up just to be killed. None of the characters are exactly well developed, I'll give you that. But none of the victims did I think really deserved to die. One of them does some annoying things but that doesn't make him a total idiot. Some of the characters in the sequels certainly fit that bill, but only the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH deserves it.",1325116800,2,3729,4.526706231454006

235814,4,6300214087,"Looking at Friday the 13th, it's easy to see why the film was so controversial. Many feminist groups were so angered by these types of movies in the 1980's. After all, aren't these films merely an excuse to show a topless girl running through the woods waiting to get impaled on a killer's ""long blade""? The references to death and sex aren't exactly subtle. As Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film states, many feminists were downright disgusted by Friday the 13th finding it repulsive and borderline offensive that every female in the film, with the exception of the ""final girl"" (which I will go into detail on later), is killed because of her sexual experience and independence. What kind of message does this send to the female youth of America? Stay subservient to your male partner and everything will end up being okay for you?

Does Friday the 13th add to the ""media's representation of women as passive, dependent on men, or objects of desire"" as many feminist film critics have stated? Well, that is left up to debate. For example, a select group of feminists actually applauded this film and other slasher films like it. In fact, while most feminists theorists label the horror film as a ""male-driven/male-centered genre"", feminist critics like Carol Clover pointed out that in most horror films, especially in horror films like the Friday the 13th series, the audience, male and female, is structurally `forced' to identify with the ""innovative and resourceful young female"" (""the final girl"" as described earlier) who survives the killer's attack and usually ends the threat. She argues that ""while the killer's subjective point of view may be male within the narrative, even the male viewer is still rooting for the ""final girl"" to overcome the killer.""

Nonetheless, many key film critics disagreed with the argument that horror films like Friday the 13th are ""pro-feminist."" In 1981, Roger Ebert, film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, launched a ""famous diatribe against the subjective point-of-view killing mechanism"" of the slasher film which, as he argued, ""placed viewers in the position of `seeing as' and, therefore, `identifying with' the maniacal killers."" Nevertheless, many filmmakers and other critics disagreed with the ""simplistic association of subjective point of view shooting with audience identification by believing in point-of-view cutting as a stronger way of achieving audience identification with a character."" If anything, it could be argued that this point-of-view shooting makes horror films forces the audience to identify with the female protagonist that much more. Or, as feminist critic Clover calls it, ""masochistic rather than sadistic.""

Looking at Friday the 13th, it is not hard not to see why the criticisms were made. The film is poorly acted, poorly directed on a minimal budget with a core story that, at best, rips off the Halloween franchise frame by frame. However, this would be avoiding the very essence of why these horror films are so popular. People don't go to Friday the 13th expecting a great, cinematic movie going experience; they are going to Friday the 13th to have fun. It can be argued that films like Friday the 13th are escapist entertainment at their very best. There is nothing fundamentally great about these films but that's really the point. They are fun, they are scary (if, by today's standards, cheesy and tame), and they are very entertaining.

The feminist critics that attack these films don't seem to see the power these films contain. Here, in Friday the 13th, is a young woman who must put all the pieces of the mystery everything together and save her friends in order to survive the night. And survive she does, something that not a single other male does in the course of the film. In fact, looking at the series as a whole, it takes the franchise until Part 4 before it even allows a male to survive in the end. It should come as no surprise that this male is survived with a female who, once again, was forced to save the day on her own. Whereas in other film genres, such as romantic comedies and dramas, where females are pushed aside to ""girlfriend support"" roles, Friday the 13th tries to do something different with gender roles by making the males the ""supportive partner"" and forcing the young female teenager to go take charge and same the day. In essence, the female in this film, as in many other horror films, is the hero.",1321833600,,4446,4.924

The movie starts off with a sort of flashback to what is essentially the original Friday the 13th to explain how we got to where we are with Jason as the menacing killer.  The film has plenty of scares, brutal killings, and tension to keep it very entertaining.

The redesigned Jason is menacing and fearful; he's neither the deformed scrawny maniac from the first few films nor is he the goliath brute from later films.  This incarnation of Jason takes the best from all the films and packs them into this truly great slasher.

I totally bought the notion that Jason could in fact run, unlike the later Friday films where he leasurely walked around, killing his victims.  Jason is driven by rage, right?  He'd want to kill as many people as possible, right?  He'd probably be in a hurry.

Anyway, if you liked the Friday films, but maybe think they are a little too cheesy by today's standards, you'll really enjoy this revamping of a classic slasher.  If you are a ""Jason purist"" then you'll likely not like the changes.",1318809600,2,1190,4.467592592592593

It doesn't add anything new to the franchise, isn't more artfully done, doesn't have bigger scares or more inventive `kills' (this Jason seemed more head obsessed than anything else, maybe because his mother lost her head decades ago?).  At any rate, it's passable entertainment.  But I definitely miss the qualities the other films had that these filmmakers overlooked in their haste to outdo the originals.  I especially miss the trademark music that is so firmly associated with Jason.  I also didn't care for their choice of lighting....as in most of the scenes were so dark you couldn't tell what was happening (which makes it pointless).
This felt less like another incarnation of Jason and more like a copycat killer wannabe.

235869,4,6300214087,"May 9th 1980: Friday the 13th was released, earning $39,754,601 at the box office. To date, it has spawned ten sequels, dozens of imitators, a televison series and a high-profile remake.

Review: It is no secret that the success of John Carpenter's 1978 horror masterpiece, Halloween, inspired Sean S. Cunningham and writer Victor Miller to create Friday the 13th.

Nearly one year after the release of Halloween, with only a $700,000 budget, Cunningham and crew ventured off into the woods of New Jersey to broaden the boundaries of a slasher film. Sadly, for many viewers, the film's nuances and subtleties is lost to those who have either seen the sequels prior to the original film or are all too well-aware of the backstory.

This is an interesting element that is often ignored; Friday the 13th actually had more of a story - and subplots - than what the series would become accustomed to, or even given credit for.

For one, the original film is played off as a mystery as no one knows - or should know - who the killer is. Could it be one of the counselors? Steve Christy, the owner of the camp site? Or could it be the revenge of a child who has returned from the grave to seek his vengeance? This element of the film is often completely lost to those who are just now visiting the film for the first time. This is often the problem for long-running franchises.

Unlike most of the film's sequels, there is a clear difference between each character. Now, these are not dramatically enriched characters, but much more so than most slasher films of its time. It should also be remembered that characterizations in this film were new for their time and it is really what spearheaded many of the genre's clichs that followed.

With a rather simplistic story that centers around mysterious incidences and creative kills set to the backdrop of Camp Crystal Lake (or Camp Blood, as some locals call it), Friday the 13th is an intentionally gradual horror film that is better than what most would claim. It features one of the earliest roles of Kevin Bacon's career, an effective - and now legendary - musical score by Harry Manfredini, and of course, the terrific make-up effects by Tom Savini, which would really set the template for 80's horror films. Ironically, Halloween II would be one such film that would follow in its gory footsteps.

Now, over the years, Friday the 13th has been released on many home video formats in various different ways. Currently, the DVD market has two versions available. The theatrical cut of the film is only available in the  Friday the 13th - From Crystal Lake to Manhattan (Ultimate Edition DVD Collection), which includes the first 8 films on 4 discs and an additional bonus disc of extras that include The Friday the 13th Chronicles (8-part featurette), Secrets Galore Behind the Gore (3-part featurette), Crystal Lake Victims Tell All!, Tales from the Cutting Room Floor, Friday Artifacts and Collectibles, and of course, Scary Trailers. It may not be the definitive set that fans had been clamoring for, it is still a solid, affordable collection that is worth checking out.

For those who don't want the whole set, however, you can pick up either the DVD or BluRay release of Friday the 13th Uncut (Deluxe Edition). Both editions only include the uncut version, but it really isn't all that much different from the theatrical cut. The special features included on these single-disc only releases has a creatively edited Commentary by Sean S. Cunningham with cast and crew, Fresh Cuts: New Tales from Friday the 13th featurette, The Man Behind the Legacy: Sean S. Cunningham featurette, A Friday the 13th Reunion, Lost Tales from Camp Blood - Part 1, and the theatrical trailer. After viewing the extra features on Anchor Bay's well-made His Name Was Jason: 30 Years of Friday the 13th, this release falls way short. It seems rather redundant, and uninvolving.

235876,4,6300214087,"Out of all these ridiculous a$$ remakes of classics their doing nowadays, I have to say that the Friday the 13th remake was brilliant.
This is completely off-topic but before I begin I just want to randomly say that Michael Myers is my favorite serial killer, and I actually liked the original Halloween flicks more than the original Friday the 13th flicks, this is becuase watching the first Halloween, it was straightforward, Michael Myers was the killer point blank, since the first Halloween. The original Friday the 13th, Jason's mother was the killer, and then they revamped it, which in my opinion is why they kept having sequels to it, and keep in mind Jason Voorhees didn't get a trademark mask until Friday the 13th part 3. Honestly, this is the reason why I didn't dig the Friday films, it was just annoying, and again in my opinion, it was just like Coca-cola and Pepsi. Halloween was coca-cola, and of course their needs to be competitors so, Friday the 13th was pepsi.

Now reviewing this remake. I saw Rob Zombie who also in my opinion generally just sucks at directing films, becuase he RUINED Halloween and Halloween II. The only thing I liked about the remake of Halloween 1 was that he gave Michael Myers lifestory a little more. Thats about it.
Now this Friday the 13th remake was awesome! The dude that was behind this movie was the same dude that did the Texas Chainsaw remakes which were also good films. He remade this movie the way it should have been remade. Cutting to the chase! When the movie begins, we know what Jason's mother already did, and how she gets killed. So it basically sticks to the original plot, no goofy twists. It's still camp crystal lake, and it's still brainless teenagers who just get wasted, and smoke weed, and lust for eachother that Jason murders!
What I also dig about this remake is basically it put together the first 3 original Friday films all in this one, so you see our classic villain when he's slaying with that potato sack thing on, and later on he gets his classic mask that we all know. What I also thought was pretty interesting and a little twisted was how he didn't hack that girl that reminded him of his mother, he kept her like a trophy in his little hideout, and he took care of her, like brought dead squirrels for her to eat, even though she wasn't hungry. It was tight because it made Jason look like he wasn't some brainless thing, and the way he brought that squirrel or whatever animal that was, made it seem like he's a hunter that knows what he's doing.
  That being said, the way he kills in this movie doesn't dissapoint at all. In fact, the way he does it is tactical, it isn't all cat-and-mouse crap. It makes you see that becuase Jason's territory and homage is in the woods, he's very much adapted to his enviorment, an example is the way he kills this couple out in the lake, he instantly kills this kid on a boat from a distance with a bow and arrow,with one try? THATS GOOD AIM!, and after the girl messes up her head from the boat, Jason finished her when she hides under the dock, using his instict, she takes a blade to the brain. How cliche! I actually was so amazed at HOW HE killed that dude with the arrow I rewinded it a couple times! There's a couple times where people see Jason and are like ""aaaahhhhhh"" and run away and he slays them, but most of the time he gets them when it's least expected, like when he got his mask. Like I said, Jason's murders are tactical.
  Overall, out of all these remakes they are remaking, this one definitely kicks ass, if they make a second part to this new Friday franchise I'll look forward to it, but this one doesn't seem like they will becuase it was that good! Some people are going to say that this movie blows, and another crappy remake, take it from me, disregard them! They've just seen other crappy remakes like Black christmas, and Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm street, that they just assume Friday the 13th is gonna blow. It doesn't! It actually is pretty much worth your time!",1308700800,2,4027,4.466032608695652

235918,1,6300214087,"I agree there have been some really good remakes in film, especially Carpenter's ""The Thing"", Cronenberg's ""The Fly"", and Phillip Kaufman's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". I hate to contradict that when I'm taking my 'stance' against remakes, but the thing is the principal for the remake to begin with: So a whole new generation can appreciate the story, and that, IMO, is wrong, because it robs the original art of filmmaking; and, thus, we see the vision of great film makers like Hitchcock, Welles, Wilder, Capra, DeMille, Polanski, De Palma, Kubrick, Lynch, etc, etc, disappearing from the screen.

I would rather have a axe to the skull than to sit through garbage like this. May Jason Vorhees rise from the undead and stalk and kill Michael Bay for even releasing such a piece of crap on the public. If you wanna see a great slasher/horror flick, then seek out the 1980 ""Friday the 13th"", and/or the 1st two or three sequels (after ""Part 5"" they sucked), but forget this turd even exists.

The ""Friday"" films weren't classic cinema by no means, but they represented the era they were made in, and that to me is what counts.

Michael Bay is terrifying enough without ruining great horror films. And, remakes are a travesty! Could you imagine books being rewritten by new authors every new decade? Or albums being re-recorded by new groups???! No way! So why do we allow films to be remade???!

Seriously, could you imagine a publisher hiring a new author to re-write, let's say Stephen King's ""Carrie"" and/or ""The Shining"" so a new generation could relate to how it reads in new text because they weren't taught to appreciate the art of literature to begin with??? Doesn't someone own the rights to films like an author owns book rights?

Another reason I'm against remakes is I consider it to be thievery on a grand scale. How would all of these popcorn eating fans of these 're-imagined' films feel if they had made the original film themselves just to see some unknown filmmaker wanna-be come along and pilfer their work for their own gain??? I don't think they would be too crazy about it then, huh!!

The video quality was excellent.  This movie must have been recorded digitally, because it looked great, and there was absolutely no grain, even in the dark scenes. The only thing wrong with the video was the bright blue stripes that appeared occasionally, mostly around the flashlights people were carrying, but a couple of times when there were no lights.

The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack was also very good.

There was supposed to be an extended cut, in addition to the theatrical release, but there was no selection screen at the beginning, so I forgot to select the extended version.  I guess it defauled to the theatrical release, because it was only 1 hour and 46 minutes long.

The aspect ratio was 2.4:1, so there are black bars at the top and bottom, but I like movies that way.

And, as we all know, Jason only makes an appearence at the end of the movie. So who is the killer, stalking wanna-be camp couslers? Watch and find out! This is one of Kevin Bacon's first movies, and his death is rather nasty in this film. So many movies copy off of the Friday the 13th series, but none come even close to this! The original is my favorite, and the 2 sequels following are pretty good, but sequels begin to suck after a while, and this is no exception. After a while, Jason dies, and is a zombie, then goes to NY and outerspace, and hell, it just goes out of control. This is definiatly the best, I think, because it is realistic, and the ending makes ya jump 10 feet!

235923,1,6300214087,"I'm a long time fan of the Friday the 13th series but this remake was a disappointment to me. I draw a parallel between this Friday remake and Rob Zombie's Halloween remake. At least Zombie tried to give some origins to Michael Myers. The guys who remade F13 tried nothing new. They took no risks at all! I thought they would try to give us some background on Jason and his origins. Or how about answering the question of how Jason lived through his drowning? Also the way this movie is shot is just terrible for the viewer. This film for some reason appears to be shot in the shadows even during the day shots. The part where Jason's deformed face is shown happens in the shadows and happens for just a split second, there is no long gross shot of Jason's face like there was in Part 3 or the Final Chapter. There are some interesting kills in this movie but it's just not enough to make it interesting. As of this writing it's been 4 years since this movie was made and there is still no talk of a sequel to this movie. It actually made less money than Freddy vs Jason. There's no buzz on when or if the F13 franchise will continue or has Jason seen his last movie?",1304726400,,1167,4.237668161434978
235924,4,6300214087,"I became a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" series with ""Part V: A New Beginning"" (1985) and have subsequently seen all of the films in the series. This '09 reboot takes elements of the first four films, drops all campy elements and provides better scares and a more dangerous Jason, who runs, shoots arrows and schemes. In the original series Jason was comparable to an unstoppable zombie-like force, particularly as the series progressed where Jason became more & more infernal and monstrous. Here he's more human, which makes sense since it's early in the timeline and Jason hasn't yet morphed into the hellish zombie he became in later segments.

The appeal of the series for me, believe it or not, is not the gore or kills but rather the plot of a group of youths gathering in the wilderness to have a good time, which stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm THAT old, but you know what I mean). The addition of an infernal killer on the loose adds a necessary element of threat & suspense; and Jason's a quality nemesis/monster. Simply put, ""Friday the 13th"" is a fun and entertaining series with creepy elements, but I never found it all that scary, not even the first two films, which are the most serious in tone. Of course there are jump-scares galore, but that's not what I'm talking about. With the third installment, a goofy element was added, making the series even less scary. The good thing about this '09 reboot is that it throws out the campy aspects and opts for a more serious approach, like the first two films. In addition, it has a couple of sequences that produce actual frights, something I never experienced with the original series, as well as scenes with genuine suspense, like when Jason chases the three protagonists through the tunnels, etc.

Speaking of the three protagonists, the cast is filled with youthful no-names, but the three main protagonists -- a brother & sister and a brunette who takes a liking to the brother -- are good and likable. It's always nice to have some people you can root for. Really, there are only two characters who are unlikable, a creepy redneck hick (and his ""hot"" mannequin, lol) and the arrogant alpha-male whose father owns the vacation house.

I found one aspect of the film highly unusual and unique. I'm referring to the 24-minute prologue before the opening credits. This has to be one of the longest prologues in film history. I have to give credit to the filmmakers for being creative and trying something different.

This reboot also just plain LOOKS better than all those older films; I'm referring mostly to the creepy woods at night. This is to be expected, of course, with the advancements in filming technology since 1980, not to mention the much bigger budget.

As far as women go (the series is known for its excellent assortment of women in practically every entry), this one's not as good as most of the films in the franchise. There's the excellent Amanda (America Olivo) in the first act and also Whitney (Amanda Righetti)and Jenna(Danielle Panabaker) as the two female protagonists. They're solid, but none of them are blow-your-mind gorgeous, like Pam in Part V, Agent Marcus in Part IX and Heather in Part XI (FvJ). Of course it's all a matter of taste.

The film was shot in the heart of Texas, mainly in regions relatively near Austin.

I have the ""Killer Cut"" that runs 106 minutes, while the theatrical version runs 97 minutes. Needless to say, this is a heavy R-rated picture.

FINAL WORD: My biggest criteria for judging the worth of a film is whether or not it pulls me in and makes me forget about the passing of time. This '09 reboot succeeds in this respect. Although nothing can replace the initial 1980 film this reboot should be given credit for generating a few genuine scares (which, again, I rarely if ever experienced with the original series) and providing a worthy trio of protagonists, as well as scenes of genuine momentum and suspense. Other than these factors, the reboot is just more of the same as far as the series goes, but it's at least as good as the better sequels, although it's not as fun because it's more of a serious horror film. Yet it fails to approach the greatness of the '09 remake of ""The Last House on the Left,"" a veritable masterpiece that transcends the usual one-dimensional nature of most slasher flicks, not that I would ever expect (or necessarily want) that for ""Friday the 13th.""

1.) Jason drowned. Plain and simple. He is ""supernatural"". He wasn't wandering around the woods to see his mother killed.
2.) Jason doesn't keep victims anywhere. He is like a shark. Sharks do not attack and then hide the carcas somewhere for later.
  Sharks kill and move on. Jason is the same.
3.) Jason is supernatural, he doesn't need ""underground tunnels"".
4.) No one, I mean NO ONE, sneaks up on Jason. He does the sneaking.
5.) Jason NEVER turns on the light. NEVER!

Because of these things and others (i.e. this movie seemed to be TCM Remake 2) I could not get into it. I just could not get passed this stuff because it was called FRIDAY THE 13TH. Another name and bad guy I could've been on board.

While Halloween can usually considered to be the first true American slasher film, it was Friday that popularized them. It is sometimes hard to see why. but a few things need to be taken into account.

The film's final plot twists, rather subtly foreshadowed early on were NOT widely known as they are today.

The basic concept was still novel instead of being an entire genre.

The public was still not used to much violence at all in their horror.

The ending had people leaving the theatre in a buzz.

These factors in place, the film caught a certain wave that was coming through horror cinema at the time and rode it well. The sequels are each really their own beasts, but should not be used to retroactively judge the first film as tame or boring.",1302566400,2,883,4.453416149068323

While some movies have a single writer, to properly bring the new Friday the 13th they had Damian Shannon and Mark Swift for the screenplay and story as well as Mark Wheaton on the story as well. Shannon and Swift both have experience with the Friday the 13th universe as they co-wrote Freddy vs Jason together. Knowing this will turn some people away immediately as this was one of the more ill received movies of both of these franchises (I'll admit it having hated it when it came out but having re-watched it recently it wasn't nearly as bad as I remembered.) The final writer has done a couple movies previously though is his first entry into the Slasher genre.

This film is kind of a tough one to really go over because for as much as they got right with the reintroduction to the franchise there was so much that was wrong. The movie feels like it is a short movie at the introduction followed by the main feature that both involve the same characters (much as Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 felt like.) The only difference is all of it is ""real"" in the realm of Jason Voorhees and the first part of the movie actually takes classic moments from the first couple and remakes them to give us a kind of prologue for anyone who hasn't seen the originals. This does not feel like a waste of time though. Just like Halloween 2 the introduction was the best part of the film. It had the classic moments that all felt just right while showing how little actually happened in the first few movies.

While the movie was able to follow the formula of a Jason movie ""decently"" after the introduction there was a slew of problems that brought everything great to a drag. Jason's kills in the past all had that huge build up and pay off to each and everyone. This new entry into the franchise has the buildup down pat but each and every kill felt as if it lacked the payoff. While some of the styled in killing weren't predictable this was due to them lacking the true strength of previous kills.

While it holds up as an OK watch and I highly enjoyed the introduction to catch anyone up on the series it kind of falls apart after that. There were modern day additions to a classically proven formula that just should not have made the cut: torture, traps, prolonged kills, abduction, a high level of gore, and Jason actually taking the time to run. Jason doesn't run the entire point is a pepe le pew styled slow walk that would always catch up to the person running due to a mistake on their part or just getting tired. I really wanted this movie to work since the originals were all full of campy fun (and not something you should take as a serious slasher flick) but it just never seemed to reach the fun level and that's a shame for all Friday the 13th fans.",1301788800,2,2939,4.398897058823529
235971,4,6300214087,"Friday The 13th (1980) rides on the coattails of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978).  Carpenter's movie inspired Friday The 13th and so many other horror movies where suddenly a holiday or special occasion is no longer safe, such as Silent Night Deadly Night, April Fools Day, New Years Evil, My Bloody Valentine, Prom Night, Happy Birthday To Me, and on and on and on.  Of course, Halloween was inspired by such movies as Psycho and Black Christmas, so credit is due there.  As much as Friday The 13th took inspiration from Halloween, it also helped inspire other movie makers to make these previously mentioned knockoffs beginning in the early 1980s.

Anyway...

What else can be said about Friday The 13th?  It's a low budget slasher horror movie that features one of the iconic monsters in horror movie franchise history - Jason Voorhees (well, at least at the end of the movie).  Michael Myers was the trailblazer, of course, then Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger followed.  Camp Crystal Lake is being re-opened more than 20 years after some unsolved murders took place.

There is that beautiful obsession we have as teens with sex and violence. In fact, I used to almost exclusively watch horror films. While I'll always carry the same obsessions, I have matured to the degree that I enjoy anything that's well done--it doesn't have to involve a body count.

When I found out they were remaking Friday the 13th I was naturally not pleased. However, this film is skillfully done. It's really like any other movie, but with the Friday the 13th lore. It's still easy for me to enjoy teenage iniquity severed with a blade.",1297900800,,709,4.496124031007752

236018,3,6300214087,"This 2009 remake by Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes studio is essentially a mix of the first four films from the original series. Pamela Voorhees only makes a cameo in the opening scene while Jason Voorhees is the main killer here. Even though Pamela was the killer in the original I can see why and don't blame that they didn't make her the killer for this remake. When people think of Friday the 13th they think of Jason Voorhees and many in the modern audience would be dissapointed without him in this.
This film comes off feeling like just another sequel thana full-on reboot of the series. A few small changes in the storyline and this could have been just another sequel. The storyline is typical of one many of the origial films with a group of college students going on a vacation to a cabin in the woods near crystal lake. This film also changes the character of Jason somewhat. In here he will often run after victims instead of power walk like in the originals and also keeps a girl he captured hostage instead of killing her right away. Jason Voorhees is shown to be overall more intelligent in here than he ever was in the original series and even sets some traps that some of his victims fall into. The remake does offer some good kills and possibly the best sex scene yet in a Friday the 13th movie, Possibly even surpassing the tent scene from Jason Goes to Hell. Overall this sin't a bad Friday the 13th movie. It certainly beats out the later sequels from the original series but doesn't quite live up to the early films. If all you want is a fun slasher movie with some good kills and aren't expecting it live up to the first you probably won't be dissapointed.

236019,5,6300214087,"After the success of HALLOWEEN, producers and directors across the country rushed to cash in on the popularity of the new teen slasher. No one accomplished this better than LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT producer Sean S. Cunningham with 1980's FRIDAY THE 13TH, which was purportedly sold to investors based strictly on the name alone without a script. FRIDAY THE 13TH set the standard for countless other camp killer pictures to follow by trapping a group of teenage counselors with a murdering psycho in the woods at Camp Crystal Lake. Each of the teens that are caught doing drugs, sleeping together, or fooling around on the job are then killed off in the most gruesome methods imaginable before the killer is identified and must be stopped by the last surviving female, or ""final girl,"" as she would come to be called.

The portrayal of death in the Horror film is as old as the genre itself, carried over from the macabre spectacles that were found in the Theater of the Grand Guignol. Throughout the 1960's and 70's, filmmakers like Mario Bava and Wes Craven pushed the limits of violence and gore, but no one did this better than George Romero's star pupil Tom Savini. With FRIDAY THE 13TH, Savini introduced a number cutting-edge special effects that left audiences disgusted and fans amazed at the stunning results. Sean Cunningham frequently uses misdirection to heighten the effect of the shocks, making it that much more surprising when Kevin Bacon has an arrow thrust through his neck in all of its blood-spurting glory! FRIDAY THE 13TH also lays claim to showing the first frontal on-screen beheading during the film's climactic end.

While FRIDAY THE 13TH and the Slasher sub-genre at large have been criticized for being misogynistic in their depictions of women in peril, further investigation into the films shows that quite the opposite is true. FRIDAY THE 13TH is empowering to women in a number of ways. The female victims typically tend to be more resourceful and cautious than their male counterparts. The number of men that are killed also exceeds the number of women, and where the deaths of the men are almost always shown in gory detail, the women are usually killed off-camera (only the aftermath is shown). Adrienne King embodies every element of the ""final girl"" in her role as Alice, a smart and capable young woman that uses her skills to elude the killer until she is able to gather the strength and courage for a final confrontation. FRIDAY THE 13TH also contains a female villain, which dismisses any Freudian comparisons between the killer's relationship with his or her murder weapon and the victims (at least in this instance). If one argument could be made against the feminist theory in FRIDAY THE 13TH, it is that the killer serves as a reinforcement of traditional values, since each of the girls that express their liberated sexuality are offed, while the pure, virginal Alice survives.

FRIDAY THE 13TH takes the basic premise of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and extends it into the splatter genre with great success. It best exemplifies each of the standard conventions of the Slasher sub-genre, including a fateful wrongdoing on a significant date, a young cast of careless teens, excessive amounts of violence and nudity, and a resourceful ""final girl,"" and as such, it must be regarded as a classic.

But as a genuinely scary date movie back in 1980, this film worked.  First, the summer camp setting - with its dark woods, creepy cabins and sinister lake - was the perfect spot for a horror movie.  ""Friday the 13th"" tapped into the childhood fears of anyone who ever went camping as a kid and listened to scary stories around a fire.  Secondly, Harry Manfredini composed a very effective musical score, combining the shrieking violins of ""Psycho"" with the now-famous ""panting"" sound effect that would be used throughout the series.  And lastly, this was the only ""Friday the 13th"" film with a half-believable plot and a sensible motive for all the killing - a psychotic woman determined not to allow the camp to re-open after negligent camp counselors (engaged in having sex) allowed her son to drown in the lake.  Unlike all the Jason sequels, where anyone and everyone gets killed just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, this first film provided a reasonable explanation for the killer's hatred of promiscuous teenagers.

I'm not calling ""Friday the 13th"" a masterpiece, but it's still scary and almost plausible in a way that none of the dreadful sequels even came close to.",1287878400,,1307,4.834080717488789

236027,3,6300214087,"I'm pretty well-established in my stance against remakes.  I'm a purist, through-and-through, and although there are some surprising exceptions (and I'll gladly have my slice of humble pie in those cases), I'm pretty firm on my stance that remakes (or ""re-imaginings"", if you must) typically follow the ""we don't have any new ideas, so let's cash in on old ones"" formula.

This film is NOT one of the exceptions.

I'll be honest, I went into this film with a higher hope than I had for say, ""The Amityville Horror"" or ""The Fog""...I figured that the story of Jason Voorhees had a lot of room for elaboration, and any writer worth his salt could conjure something new or at least moderately interesting out of the character and his beginnings...indeed, I expected this, as we got a meatier chunk of Leatherface and his family's psychosis in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake done by the same production company.

Sadly, I left with a greater sense of nostalgia for the original films, as hackneyed and trite as they had become.

First and foremost, I was disappointed with the overuse of near-pornographic sex; I expect it in a slasher film...it's pretty much one of the prime ingredients, but I feel the producers went entirely overboard with it in this film.  I'm not a prude by ANY definition, but in this case it's obviously overdone, way too over-the-top to offer anything to the film other than the  satisfaction of overly-hormonal males in the eighteen-to-twenty-five year old target audience.

Secondly, with only a couple of exceptions, the characters are far, far dumber than in most of the sequels to the original film...whereas it was always fun to yell at the screen in the past when victims ALWAYS ran up the stairs to a place they couldn't escape, or ALWAYS went alone (and typically half-dressed and unarmed) to investigate the strange noise even though they KNOW there's a homicidal maniac on the loose, in THIS film the fodder seem so ignorant that it amounts to mostly frustration, and I for one felt a sense of relief when they finally met ol' Jason face-to-hockey mask.  This is not the fault of the actors, who in all but a few cases I thought performed well with the material they had to work with, but instead the blame lies on the scripting.

The incorporation of the first three films of the series (and references to several others) was a good idea, and could have worked if the writers had made the effort to breathe something new and interesting into the plot, but all you really have here is a Reader's Digest version of those first three films...a Cliff's Notes, if you will, hitting the high points but offering nothing new at all.  The only thing I found redeeming is that they finally give somewhat of an explanation as to how Voorhees could seemingly be everywhere at once.

I suppose to ""re-boot"" the franchise to a new generation, it's not a godawful film, but for the money I would suggest simply renting ""Friday the 13th"", ""Friday the 13th Part II"", and ""Friday the 13th Part III""...you'll get the same information, same story, same pretty much EVERYTHING, but as it was done originally, and in a more entertaining way.",1287273600,4,3159,4.7655677655677655

236070,4,6300214087,"The 2009 remake of Sean S. Cunningham's seminal slasher flick, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B001K9OXDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>,"" isn't so much a re-telling as it is just another trip to Camp Crystal Lake with everybody's favorite unhappy camper. Produced by Platinum Dunes, the production company spear-headed by Michael Bay, and directed by Marcus Nispel (who also helmed 2003's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre/dp/B00018D44K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>"") the twelfth (!) trip to camp is more or less an atypical 80's-style slasher with a modern finish.

What little remaking there is to be done is finished before the opening credits roll off the screen. We see a recreation of the final act of the original film, as mad Mama Voorhees (portrayed by Nana Visitor) loses her head, leaving her deformed son Jason to take up her mantle. From there, it's business as usual, as Jason (Derek Mears) dispatches of a group of horny campers before stalking an equally lame-brained group of college kids at a remote summer house near his home turf. On his tail is a loner (Jared Padalecki) whose sister (Amanda Righetti) is being held captive in a first for Jason. Not only does this incarnation of Jason run a lot (you may recall he did that in earlier flicks, too) but now he's keeping prisoners? Intriguing.

While the dreadful tone Nispel brought to the table with his ""Chainsaw"" redux is all but absent here, ""Friday the 13th '09"" -- as I would like to dub it - benefits greatly from a substantial amount of atmosphere, thanks to the excellent cinematography of Daniel C. Pearl. To say this is the best looking of all the ""Friday the 13th"" flicks would be an understatement; however, it is unfortunately not the most effective of the bunch. While the film starts strong with an energetic opening, it loses its steam as it attempts to reboot its own story about 25 minutes in. It doesn't help that our main characters are about as bland and unlikeable as they are good-looking, either. But what really kills the party is the lame-brain script by Damien Shannon and Mark Swift (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freddy-vs-Jason/dp/B0000VCZMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freddy vs. Jason</a>"") which is saturated with cringe-worthy dialog and cardboard characters. While such a thing was acceptable in the 80's, it doesn't quite mesh with the higher quality of film-making this re-boot presents itself as.

It's not all bad for the film, though. Slasher fans who grew up with the franchise will relish the fact that the updated flick doesn't attempt to re-write history or shift tone drastically, ala Rob Zombie's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B000VKL6Z2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>."" It's simply a film about a guy in a hockey mask offing teens -- nothing more, nothing less. It also helps having Derek Mears bringing one of the most intense Jason's to life in a truly ""killer"" performance. While Kane Hodder may be the definitive Jason for many, Mears brings an intensity to the role that rivals his best predecessors and reminds us that is actually does matter who's behind the hockey mask. The kills, which are the true star of these films, aren't as creative as one would expect, but carry with them a mean streak that will have you actually feeling sorry for a few select characters. There's even a sleeping bag scene that gives ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Part-VII-The-New-Blood/dp/B002DMJLTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th, Part VII: The New Blood</a>"" a run for its money.

For all of its dim moments, we must remember, afterall, that this is a ""Friday the 13th"" film and if you expected anything else, that's your bad. It's hardly perfect, and sure, many of the sequels before it were better (if you ask me even ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-X/dp/B00006FI0R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason X</a>"" in particular beats it in the pure fun department), but it's also not quite as sloppy and offensive as some other remakes in recent memory.

236074,3,6300214087,"In 1979 Sean S. Cunningham was looking to produce a mere potboiler to tide him over until his next serious project. His idea of a Summer Camp Killer movie seemed like a decent, low-budget, one-shot deal and he went with it. There was nothing particularly memorable or unique about it but it was bought by Paramount and released as a mainstream film, rather than a independent struggler. The response was huge and it soon became clear that Friday the 13th was not a mere paycheck but a serious cash-cow. Sequels followed. And the rest is history.

Many, many people claim that Friday the 13th rips off Halloween. Which is not a very fair or kind statement. Sure, it's no work of art and has many similarities, but Halloween was NOT the first slasher movie as Black Christmas and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre came before it. I was actually draw more parallels between this and The Last House on the Left, which was also produced by Cunningham. Friday the 13th is a slicker, tamer film in comparison but if TLHOTL never existed then we would have the Friday the 13th franchise that we have today.

The characters and deaths are not so imaginative. All we really get is throat slashings and impalings. But at least the fodder are not as obnoxious and annoying as they would later become in the sequels, when they truly deserved more grotesque deaths.

At the time, the ending was surprising only because it came out of nowhere. The sudden unveiling of the killer and motives was random and unexpected. It's weird watching it now, knowing that Jason and parts 2-infinity were never planned. Jason was just a dead boy and nothing more.

It's hard to review Friday the 13th on it's own merits rather than the movie that launched a major franchise. A low-brow slasher script made into a potboiler movie that ended up making zillions in sequels, spin-offs, TV series', toys, games and accessories seems so far-fetched.

If you watch carefully, you'll notice that the framing on this release actually makes more sense. Look at the title screen compared to the older DVD releases; notice how the ""Friday the 13th"" opening logo is actually centered, and not veering off to the right.

So the framing is correct. How 'bout the picture quality?

Excellent. Filmic. Appropriate grain, untouched and untampered with. My assumption is this is exactly how the film looked upon its initial release in theaters. It's low-budget, it's cheap stock and lighting, it's not the most detailed film around, but this Blu-ray Disc represents it accurately.

Highly recommended for fans of this slasher classic.

The Blu-rays for movies 2 and 3 look excellent and filmic as well, bearing in mind that ""Part 3"" was filmed in such a way to achieve the 3D effect; it looks a bit blurry, especially to the sides, but this is intrinsic of its original photography.

The film opens years back at a camp ground, where see see two camp counselors running off for their own ""wants"", when we see 3D shot of a person walking towards them, and slaughtering them, bringing us to the credit sequence ""Friday the 13th"".

Well, we are know introduced to a group of teens at this campground. One girl Annie arrives by a truck driver, who tells her that a young boy named Jason Voorhees drowned here because he couldn't swim and drowned because the counselors were having sex. So this worries Annie abit. She hitchhikes again in a car by an unidentified person, and then is murdered in the forest by a driver.

The other kids are just preparing the cabins at Camp Crystal Lake. Soon, most of the counslors are violently killed off, exept for Alice. Alice soon finds some of the bodies. Suddenly she sees a car pull up, she thinks its her boyfriend, but an elderly woman (played by Betsy Palmer) pops out. She admits to being the mother of the drowned boy, Mrs. Voorhees. She tells the story about what happened at that unfaithful day, but once she reaches the saddest part, she attacks Alice, being revealed as the murderer. The fight all the way down the beach shorline, where Mrs. Voorhees is decapitated.

The next day, Alice wakes up in a canoe, all peaceful, but suddenly, the body of Jason Voorhees flings at her from under the water, and pulls her under. The police say once they rescued Alice, they didn't find any boy, so Alice believes, Jason has been freed...",1278374400,3,1674,4.5514950166112955

236124,1,6300214087,"FRIDAY THE 13TH is perhaps one of the most ugly, vulgar films from the
'80s era of cheap slasher exploitation movies. Not only does it shamelessly
 steal every element of itself from superior horror films (PSYCHO, CARRIE,
and especially John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN) it is thoroughly unable to create
 suspense of any kind, but instead indulges the viewer with excessive (for that
 time) violence that frankly isn't scary.
The plot is simple enough. Seven teenagers (or eight, if you count the
 one that gets decapitated before she gets there) get jobs as camp counselors
at the infamous Camp Crystal Lake, known to the locals as Camp Blood due to the
murders that took place there years ago that have kept the camp closed. Of course,
our stupid and attractive group of teen soon-to-be victims don't head the residents warnings and are killed off one by one by an unseen killer. This is how the film goes on for the first 85 minutes
 or so, then the killer is identified (and we get the only decent acting bit in the
whole film) and we have that dumb twist ending that leaves room for a sequel (or ten).
This is the slasher film that pretty much ruined the genre, as few subsequent slashers
 offered SUSPENSE for entertainment instead of cheap VIOLENCE for entertainment(although
 a mix of both isn't bad, that's even rarer). We don't even get to learn the
character's names, let alone know them, so how the heck are we supposed to feel
 for them? Apparently most fans of this tired series don't care, they just want to
 see a few naked babes stabbed in the chest before the closing credits.",1275264000,4,1589,4.666666666666667

236159,1,6300214087,"Whenever I watch the increasingly endless line-up of botched remakes of beloved horror classics, I try not to knock the poor cast. The young actors in this abomination all try hard and give it their all. All of them do excellent work in their limited characters. But a god-awful script and direction bring the whole thing down.

You watch and mentally compare it to its predecessor and you become even more disgusted. For the 80 million budget (including heavy promotion) the movie makers could have made a brand new horror franchise and given the fans something to remember. Instead, most will remember this junk for all the wrong reasons.

A group of young people go to a cabin on Crystal Lake where they're aware that horrible things happened there in the past. Yet, from the first frame to the final one, the story makes plain that these kids are not about to worry about a possible psycho on the loose. They're all too busy having SEX to worry about anything.  If a boy looks at a girl, he wiggles his brows and talk about much he wants to f_____. If a girl looks at a guy, she tries to be a Playboy centerfold by licking her lips and half-closing her eyes and if this doesn't work, she flashes her boobs.
In one bizarre scene, the killer has invaded the house but a couple upstairs in a bedroom are too busy screaming as they have graphic sex to hear somebody warning them to be alert.

In another scene, another boob says he's going down to the boathouse altough everyone knows the killer is lurkng out there. While the idiot sings and hums to himself and he plays around in the boathouse he suddenly discovers--who else--the klller? In another moan-inducing scene, the killer has made it clear he's close-by the cabin. One of the girls suddenly decides to go upstairs and look around. She sees a window half-open. Then she searches for the killer by looking in the closet and then the bathtub.  Of course, while looking, she carries no weapon of any kind. Not even a hair brush. And so when the killer finally kills her, you want to applaud.

Michael Bay was naturally one of the producers on this putrid mess. You'll find his name on every remake of a horror classic that's played at your multiplex. Whenever I see him name, I know before the credits flash, that I'm in one for one miserable movie experience.",1268784000,3,2318,4.546762589928058

That said, I was pleasantly surprised.  It kept me entertained.  The dialogue is amusing and you'll find plenty of gore and boobs.  Speaking of boobs, Julianna Guill (Bree in the movie) is simply amazing naked.  That won't get me to like a movie by itself, but it sure doesn't hurt my overall opinion.

If you have some time to kill and are in the mood for something you don't have to take too seriously, I'd recommend giving this a watch.  It probably helped that I had very low expectations, but I also don't think it fully deserves the horrible rating it has on Rotten.

236162,4,6300214087,"This film is not nearly as bad as is reviewed here (and other forums).  Let me begin by stating that the transfer / Blu Ray is 100% clear and certainly leaves nothing to be desired in the AV department.  Having said that,  I see NO difference between the standard DVD release and the Blu Ray.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR FUNDS ON THE BLU RAY,  tis' a waste.

Steve Jablonsky's score/music was subtle,  yet far more effective than Manfredini's.
(Forgive me Harry).

The production design does suck.  The sets aren't nearly as foreboding as they could/should have been.  Virginia Field's work (and the location) on the first two films,  and Robb Wilson King's on the third,  were much better.  This film lacked the feel it deserved.

Shannon and Swift should have excised the first 23+ minutes of this film and replaced it with more of an origin story.  The time line set herein was perfect.  Yet the damned thing played out during the three minutes with the credits ON IT.  I was inflammed with the first act in this film.  It sucked.  Should have taken more from Miller/Kurz's script on the first two films.  Nana Visitor and Stephanie Rhodes should have been given WAY more screen time.

Pandalecki was numbing.  Yet,  Righetti was great.  I also thought Van Winkle was a great choice for the ""a-hole"" role.  Willa Ford was the worst of the pick:  her character was irritating not by script,  but by play out.

It is my opinion that the real ""reboot"" should have started after the first 23 or so minutes.  I enjoyed the final part of the film.  Derek Mears is a great choice to play ""Jason Voorhees"" too.  I'm glad to see ""Jason"" on the big screen and I look forward to the second ""reboot"" film.",1266710400,2,1687,4.523333333333333

Now onto my opinion.
I'll get rid of the negative right away. Only the Blu-Ray included both Theatrical and Extended cuts. DVD's on this movie aren't very good, put that's probably because it got such a bad rating.
Many times, this is refereed to as a ""remake"" and Jason is on the cover, and that will mean one of two things to the uneducated: A. This movie is dumbed down for a wider audience and does not stay true or B. Jason was in the original. However, watching the movie, it basically chronicles 13th's 1-3 and bits of 4, Jason's mom reeks havoc and gets killed by a mechete, Jason comes back in a Potato sack, losses his Potato sack, we see him unmasked and he comes for his mask. The rest is typical Slasher flick. I love it, it really is one of the bright shines of light in the darkness that is Horror films today. My favorite part is when the guy gets hit by an ax to the back, but he falls on his stomach, so he's still alive. Then Jason picks him up, and gives him a Power Bomb! He was like The Undertaker, (LAST RIDE! LAST RIDE!) And the ax goes through the guy's lungs! WOOOO!
All in all, I can't wait to see Part 2, which will probably chronical 4-6 and parts of 7. Then Part 3 will go insane, it will be super long with  New York, Hell, Space and Freddy Kruger. I also can't wait to see the reboot of A Nightmare on Elm Street.",1265673600,,1465,4.140350877192983
236165,5,6300214087,"The Dutch have a long and rich history of homocidal rampages, and apparently Jason Voorhees is no exception.  Jason slays down many, walking squishily in the blood-soaked footsteps of the long shadow of many, many violent Dutchmen.  The Dutch propensity toward insensate violence remains to this day a profound mystery.  And indeed I seem to remember back in the late seventies watching an episode of In Search Of dedicated to this subject.  A mustachioed Leonard Nimoy raised one eyebrow and drily intoned, ""Join me then, tonight; as we go in search of the origin of the Dutch instinct for mass murder.""

Indeed, the Dutch gravitate toward mass murder just as the Japanese gravitate toward senseless suicide, however, the film's most profound conundrum, yet unriddled even as of this viewing, is the following:  was Jason Voorhees from Rotterdam, or Amsterdam?  He couldn't very well have been from Madurodam... perhaps he was from The Haigue.  Or, more intriguing yet, perhaps he was South African Dutch, hailing from Port Elizabeth where the weather is fine.  Then again, perhaps he was Pennsylvania Dutch.  Yes, perhaps he was Amish .  Then again, perhaps he was simply Dutch in the colloquial sense: your old Dutch Uncle, who is neither an uncle nor Dutch, just as blood brothers are not really brothers and country cousins do not actually migrate from the country to urban centers where they regale their sophisticated bachelor relations with their crude and rustic ways, but are instead simply what brothers and sisters - who live in the country - call one another, the idea being that if they are in fact cousins, then they are far enough removed to be ""kissin' cousins"" and, well, you can imagine the rest yourself.",1265241600,,1724,4.97212543554007

I'm not a prude, I understand that for the most part horror movies have some nuidty and sex in them but this was excessive.

If this were the only difference, I'd say skip it.

236268,5,6300214087,"Friday the 13 (2009): 8 out of 10: Jason is a bit off in this one. He moves to fast, he kidnaps people like he watched Rest Stop one too many times and he seems to lack a certain hulking presence of the original. Outside of the main character however, this is a pretty good Friday the 13th film.

Friday the 13th is billed as a relaunch (remake reboot ect) and as such it seems to confuse. It contains plot elements of the first four films (Mrs. Voorhees decapitation takes place in flashback) and Jason rightfully starts with his original sack and finds his hockey mask (as he did in part 3). In addition, while I am critical of Jason having his own 'lair' I am reminded he had one in Part 2 (Where he kept his mothers severed head lovingly surrounded by candles). The main plot of a man trying to find his missing sister is straight from part 4.
Where the film succeeds is canon fodder and nudity. There are plenty of both and most of it is of high quality. The kills range from mundane (of these there are plenty) surprisingly intense (A burning sleeping bag may cause nightmares and the topless wakeboarding will cause nothing but smiles.) The sheer number and variety of kills however is quite impressive.

Camp Crystal Lake has apparently turned into a breast implant recovery retreat. While there is only one camp counselor to be found (in grainy flashback no less) there are plenty of woman with breast implants and an aversion to wearing shirts. Julianna Guill (who in fairness may be au-natural) in particular gets points for simply being one of the most attractive women I have seen on-screen in many a movie. (Willa Ford of the topless wakeboarding scene is not half bad either.)

Considering the number of times the Friday the 13th films have gone of the rails in the past, one should not raise the bar all that high. In addition, while I am an unabashed fanboy of the series, I do recognize it does have serious limitations. (What we now refer to as its charms.) This is a flashier, more competently lensed Friday the 13th, and all in all is that such a bad thing?

There are plenty of bad jokes, drugs, nudity and violence. If that is not what you were looking for you may want to check the title screen again. As Friday the 13th movies go this is one of the best.",1256860800,3,2279,4.444976076555024

1. This movie is a prequel. -NO, it tells nothing of how Jason died or survived or how he became the being that he is now.

2. It's a remake of part one. -NO, part one takes place at Camp Crystal Lake, this one take place at some kind of luxury lakeside home.

3. Jason is smarter and more cunning. -NO, he has always been intelligent with impeccable hand-eye coordination as can be seen in all his movies.

4. Jason is now more down to earth and more 'real' and more human; he is a survivalist who can run now and doesn't just pop out of nowhere. -WRONG, see part two and three of the sequels. You'll see the same basic Jason.

What we need is a sequel that will explain the origins of Jason and his mother and neatly tie together all the sequels and odd conflicting stories we have seen (like part 9; what the hell was that about?). Please, no more refilming of parts we have already seen. Oh, and get some REAL looking teens who look like real people up in the woods... and real boobs this time.",1256428800,2,1314,4.368852459016393
236272,4,6300214087,"I was very pleased with this movie im gonna tell you the pros and cons

Pros
1. Jasons new look and persona,he is at least 6'6 and looks like a body builder,and his new clothing is good but not important,and the way he finds the hockey mask is cool. And the way he is a experinced outdoors man.
2. All of the actors are amazing in this movie
3. Bow and Arrow kill was awsome
4. More action

Cons
1. To much sex,i don't mind sex but it gets annoying after the fifityith time
2. The cliche ending,even though a sequal is coming out and there trying to take the endings of the 1st 3 movies,they could of at least of had Jason left for dead
3. Not a good shot of Jasons face,the scenes when they show Jasons face are short and not very good.

I did not put Jasons mother not in it much being a con because i prefer Jason as the killer.

As you can probably tell Horror movies aren't intended on being serious,they are just for fun,so i say on a saturday night kick back and relax and enjoy the movie",1256428800,,995,4.061224489795919
236273,2,6300214087,"The general consensus seems to be that it's a swindle and that Paramount is once again screwing the fans over.  I guess I half agree with that.  Some of the later films in the series have gotten decent treatments, and some are just outright hosejobs.
As far as this ""uncut"" first film goes, I'd say it depends.  If you have the first pressing that came out years ago, you might be interested in the bonus features depending on how hardcore you are about the series.  If you own the box set, I'd say not to bother.
First off, I don't really think it's totally uncut.  ""Uncut"" in this case is a few extra seconds tacked onto Kevin Bacon's death.  Not all that worth it if you ask me.  I know I've seen some cut scenes that showed a bit more of the gore effects, but I believe that was a European version of the film.  So no, I don't believe this film is truly uncut.
The bonus features-A short retrospective ""Making Of"" segment, which is interesting enough.  There's a n interview with Sean Cunningham, but he doesn't really say anything fans haven't heard before in other documentaries.  Then there's the Lost Tales From Camp Blood Part 1, which is a short segment of a fan made film that tries to mimic the style of the films.  Thankfully it's short coz it's not terribly good.  Then we have the commentary, and this is what pretty much sold me on this disc.  Unfortunately, it wasn't very good at all.  It's one of those commentaries where everyone recorded their parts separately, so there is no interaction.  Some folks might not mind this, but these kinds of commentaries really bug me.  Plus it seems as though none of the commentators are even watching the movie coz nobody ever comments on what is happening onscreen.  I would have liked to have heard more about particular scenes.  It's weird to think I watched an hour and thirty five minute commentary and really learned nothing at all.  In fact I hardly remember any of it.  The commentary is hosted by the dude who wrote Crystal Lake Memories, and he has a bad habit of continuously introducing the commentators before they speak.  You get really sick of hearing: ""Adrienne King-who played Alice"" before Adrienne King starts speaking.  A big letdown.
So, yes, I do believe that fans got the green weenie on this one.  It's really only necessary to purchase this if you don't already own it.",1256083200,3,2352,4.5608591885441525

236311,4,6300214087,"FRIDAY THE 13TH is a slasher flick that was released on Friday June 13, 1980 was based on concerning a group of teenagers who are murdered one-by-one while attempting to re-open an abandoned campsite.

The movie starts out with a summarized story back in the Summer of 1958 with 2 counselors Barry(Willie Adams)and Claudette(Debra Hayes)at Camp Crystal Lake who are murdered by an unseen assailant after they sneak away to a cabin to have sex and then the film jumps forward to the present day as Friday June 13th as the camp is being re-opened by counselor Steve Christy(Pete Brouwer)along with the help of several other counselors Alice(Adrienne King), Bill(Harry Crosby), Marcie(Jeanine Taylor), Brenda(Laurie Bartram), Ned(Mark Nelson), and Jack(Kevin Bacon)known for his role as Ren McCormack on FOOTLOOSE, who have been hired to help Steve with the camp as they all begin to refurbish & renovate the campsite.

Eventually, after Alice discovers her fellow camp counselors have all been slaughtered finding herself helpless, the hellbent Pamela Voorhees(Betsy Palmer)starts telling Alice about her son(Jason Voorhees)drowning in the lake at camp years ago blaming camp counselors for not watching her son, leading Alice to the discovery that Pamela is the murderer & eventually leads to Alice decapitating Pamela after a brief scuffle.

FRIDAY THE 13TH was also made on an estimated budget of $550,000 & engrossed over $39.7 million at the box office back in the Summer of 1980 and led to a long series of sequels, a crossover with the A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise & a reboot released of a new FRIDAY THE 13TH flick in the Winter of 2009.

In addition to that; the following success of FRIDAY THE 13TH in 1980 had Paramount Pictures begin planning to make a sequel & insisted that the FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART II, which was released in the Spring of 1981, have Pamela's son(Jason Voorhees), even though his appearance in this flick was only meant to be a joke, but Steve Miner(Director of FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 2)believed in the idea & would go on to direct the first 2 sequels after Sean S. Cunningham(Director of FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 1) opted not to return to the directors chair just like John Carpenter declined to direct HALLOWEEN II before it was released in the Fall of 1981, especially since Carpenter didn't want to make a sequel to HALLOWEEN I.

So director of FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 2(Steve Miner) used many of the same crew members from this film while working on the sequels just like director of HALLOWEEN 2(Rick Rosenthal)used a lot of the same members from its predecessor.

This splatter flick also gave FRIDAY THE 13TH a bad name and a belief that Friday the 13th of any month was superstitious kind of like John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN did in the Fall of 1978, MY BLOODY VALENTINE did in the Spring of 1981, SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT did in the Fall of 1985, and APRIL FOOLS DAY did in the Spring of 1986, etc.

Additionally Sean S. Cunningham's FRIDAY THE 13TH, along with John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN, helped spawn the great horror-movie movement of the '80s, not to mention eight sequels, many of which had nothing to do with the films that preceded them. It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three biggest horror-movie psychos of the modern era (the other two being HALLOWEEN's Michael Myers and A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET's Freddy Krueger).

Forever duplicated, the original Friday the 13th popularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clichs: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see a Friday the 13th movie, this is the one to check out.

A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma's CARRIE, but it still provides a slight if campy shock.

Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud--you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo--who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat. Right after having sex, of course.",1253059200,2,4492,4.8524804177545695

If I had to rank it, I would say that it's better than part III, not quite as good as part IV.  I do think Derek Mears might be my favourite Jason, though.  He's incredible in the role, and I hope to see him in the sequel.

The ""killer"" cut is the superior cut, and adds a bit more characterization.  It's also the only standard def DVD with any extras, though the Blu-Ray has more.

One thing that could definitely be improved upon is the creativity of the kills; I understand the filmmakers were going for a more realistic vibe but quite frankly many of these kills were rather boring.  It seems like most of the great slasher kills are going direct to video these days (Hatchet, Laid to Rest, etc.).

This has to be without a doubt the worse Jason movie EVER! What made it bad? It's so easy I can put it in one word only, and that is ""predictable"". I've only seen a few Jason movies all the way through but I believe ANYONE can predict when Jason would kill and by god he's right on cue. Only one seen when that girl got killed by his crossbow got me, and that is it. What makes it worse the ending was predictable. I predicted what the end of the movie was going to be at the beginning, and I was right. A remake should have at least a few twists, this one isn't even close. This one is a typical slasher movie with Jason's name printed on it and it almost ruins everything we love about Jason movies. Now, Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is a perfect example of a good remake because it had twists and things you never seen or thought before and this one doesn't.

So there's really nothing new, you got Jason and a couple of college-aged, horny kids who decide to camp or take a vacation at the wrong place and get sliced and diced. This is how its ALWAYS been. I'm not complaining, i'm just trying to make you aware of what you should expect by now if you've seen all the previous ones. There is really no difference.

Jason In my opinion was actually pretty brutal in this one. He's got some new moves. There was one gruesome murder that i couldn't watch becuase it just seem like such a BAD way to die. ugh!! Overall it was pretty good movie, i wouldnt buy it, but i would rent it, like maybe on netflix or something.

Parts That Annoyed Me:
Okay, i get it that alot of guys LOVE to see bouncing breasts, Vaginas, and other sex scenes, and i get that producers or directors add that kind of stuff into movies to get high ratings, but its like every five minutes you see a naked chick. I can NEVER watch a movie nowadays without a sex scene popping up anymore. What's up with this generation? All the sex doesnt bother me that much, however i was glad that i watched the movie alone to avoid feeling awkward in front of my parents and sister. I guess you can call me old fashion even though i'm 23, but all that crap was just uncalled for, really. if you're a guy reading this, i don't expect you to understand my view.

As for the Racist comments that people say about this movie, well it wasn't that bad, however i didn't think that all racial situations was really necessary either. Again, why can't I watch a movie with a black guy in it but at same time being withdrawn from ANY kind of racial parts? why couldn't the black guy be treated like the rest of the white fokes in it? i don't get it. They had an asian guy in there too, however they failed to do any racial parts for him, so i guess movies just aren't nice to black fokes.

As for the asian kid, His character was a bit awkward, like he was desperately trying his hardest to fit in with the group. The character just seemed very weird and out of place. NOt that actual actor but the character he played.",1250208000,3,2167,4.2270531400966185

Jason has also figured out how to sprint in this movie. Apparently he realized that his slow lumbering walk just wasn't closing the deal..He also was able to add some trip wires at strategic locations throughout the woods so he could be alerted to the presence of campers. Apparently this would allow him more time to sit around his cabin playing with the severed head of his long deceased mommy...Thats about all this remake adds to the Friday the 13th franchise.

The story was a little sparse (ok, I know it's a slasher movie and it's not going to win an Emmy) but I could live with that. I liked how they started out making it seem mostly realistic and I was hoping that they were going to get away from the ""Jason is immortal"" bit that started making the later Friday the 13th films so campy and corny. Unfortunately, the ending kind of spoiled that. I don't want to give anything away but the last scene is kind of predictable and to me that kind of killed it.

236382,3,6300214087,"After hacking and slashing his way through ten films, although to be fair his mother did the killing in the first film, Jason Voorhees' film career looked to be getting more mundane and inept with each passing sequel. With every new installment the killing was getting bloodier and more pointless as each victim became less and less likeable; meanwhile, the stories were becoming even more simplistic and at times downright ridiculous (""Jason X"", need I say more). Even after horror fans flocked to see the masked one go toe-to-toe with Elm Street's master of our nightmares in ""Freddy Vs Jason"", it seemed that getting Jason to go on another solo spree in a new ""Friday the 13th"" wasn't something fans were all that anxious to see. However, in the same year the two titans of terror came to blows, producer/director Michael Bay released a successful retooling of an old horror classic ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". With the success of that reboot, along with the remake of ""The Amityville Horror"" two years later, it appeared audiences were interested in seeing some of their old favorites dusted off and brought into modern times. This brings us to 2009 and the return of Jason Voorhees in Marcus Nispel's re-imagining of ""Friday the 13th"".

""Friday the 13th"" follows the bloody exploits of masked killer Jason Voorhees as he disposes of any and all trespassers who are unfortunate enough to come onto the property of the now defunct Camp Crystal Lake. Six weeks after a group of hikers mysteriously disappeared near the former camp; a brother to one of the hikers (Jared Padalecki) arrives in search of his missing sister. At the same time, a group of friends looking forward to a weekend full of carefree merriment soon find themselves inadvertently wandering off the beaten path and catching the eye of Jason. With the body count rising as Jason mercilessly dispenses his sentence upon all who come near; survival quickly becomes the order of the day. The question is, ""How many of these unwitting young adults will make it out of the area alive?""

After ten movies focusing either directly or indirectly on the story of Jason Voorhees, not to mention that after the fourth or fifth sequel the quality of the remainder of the films dropped drastically, one would not be out of place to wonder if yet another ""Friday the 13th"" was warranted. Personally, I've never been all that much of a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" series; I was more intrigued by the ""Halloween"" franchise (at least the first two films and then ""H20""). I will admit that ""Freddy Vs Jason"" was an entertaining horror film that was much smarter than anything either of the series' had delivered separately to audiences in some time. With that in mind, I didn't exactly walk away with a desire to see another stand alone sequel in either character's series of films.

With all that being said, perhaps you may be wondering why then did I choose to watch this reboot of ""Friday the 13th"", especially since I wasn't a fan of the character's previous films. My answer would be this, based on what I had seen in the various trailers for the film, it appeared that this installment may be a little more realistic and of a slightly higher quality than all of its predecessors (neither of these achievements would be all that hard to accomplish by the way). Written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift (""Freddy Vs Jason""), and directed by Marcus Nispel, who is no stranger to the re-imagined horror film after helming the reboot for ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", this newest ""Friday"" film is arguably the best this series has seen in its nearly 30 year history.

The story this time around is much tighter in focus and aimed primarily at returning Jason to his roots, minus (for the most part) the cheesy dialogue and bad acting that plagued the initial series' run. In general, the plot is fairly believable, or as much as it can be given the type of movie and genre it's in; however, there are a few instances where we're asked to suspend our brains a little too much in order to go along with something despite it clearly being impossible. Another complaint was that for a little while early on in the movie I found myself wondering if I was actually going to see much more from the story and its characters besides references and usages of drugs and numerous sexual escapades. Eventually, the story finally got moving, and the sex and drugs became less rampant within the movie. In regards, to the dialogue, for the majority of the film it was full of typical teenage banter, but without it being overly annoying. Yet there were a couple of moments where the dialogue took a nosedive and became far too clichd or inane for its own good. The plot point involving the search for the missing hikers was a neat way of tying the entire movie together, and provided one of only a few characters you actually hoped would survive through to the end of the movie.

The cast of ""Friday the 13th"" was surprisingly better than your typical horror film cast. That being said, there were still only a handful of characters that I actually became interested in. Leading the cast of semi-familiar faces is Jared Padalecki (TV's ""Supernatural"") as the estranged brother of one of the missing hikers that ran afoul of Jason six weeks prior. Jared brings a charisma and likeability to the character that allows the viewer to actually root for his survival regardless of the built-in sympathy card the writers have included in the movie for him. Joining him in his search is actress Danielle Panabaker (""Mr. Brooks"") as one member of a group of friends that are spending a fun-filled weekend near the old Camp Crystal Lake site. Danielle imbues her character with warmth and innocence, plus there's a surprising sincerity in her portrayal that cannot be ignored. By all rights, Danielle put more effort into her character than any horror movie role ever calls for, but it was that dedication that elevated her performance far above those of the other actors playing her vacationing friends. The remainder of the supporting cast ranged from good to slightly irritating, but what else should one expect when watching a horror movie?

Lastly, I wanted to touch briefly upon the main driving force of the movie, the monstrosity that is Jason Voorhees himself. In this movie I finally believe that Jason could actually catch one of his victims as he is more proactive in his approach to ""hunting"". A much needed new twist to the character was showcased in the time the writers took in showing Jason as more of a predator stalking his prey rather than just a brainless behemoth. The fact that Jason actually runs in pursuit of his victims is a definite, and much appreciated, boost to how much more fearsome he is this time around. As for the Jason's killings, they are definitely prevalent throughout the story, and the writers have clearly taken advantage of the opportunity provided them by Jason's newfound smarts to become a little more creative with how he goes about his business. For the horror junkies out there, don't worry about your favorite, or perhaps I should say one of your favorite, killers going soft after his thirty year run. This is the most violent and hard-hitting of the Jason movies, at least in my opinion.

At its best ""Friday the 13th"" is a decently entertaining, fast-paced slasher film that cleverly combines all of the strongest elements of the first three movies in the original series while applying a modern twist. When not at its best, the movie devolves into bouts of irritating arguments and conversations that are pointless from the get-go, moments that stretch believability too far or just relying far too much on an over-abundance of sex and drug related scenes. It's not the best horror film I've ever seen, but it is one of the better ones that have been released here lately.

""Friday the 13th"" is rated R for violence, language, gore, and sexuality/nudity.",1248220800,6,7943,4.780043699927167
236383,4,6300214087,"Before I begin this review, I just have to say that I LOVE the Friday the 13th film franchise, and it's awesome to see a reboot done this well. The film is really a coupling of the first four films, taking in elements of all four of the films. The opening scenes chronicle the end of the first film, and the rest of the film mirrors the plot in Friday the 13th Part III, as well as borrowing elements from Part II and a minor plot point from Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Friday, is turned into a major plot point in this film.

Basically, the film is about Clay, played by Jared Padalecki (a decision that I LOVE), who is searching for his sister Whitney, who disappeared along with a group of her friends around Crystal Lake. The other part of the plot follows a group of teenagers who are staying at a summer house near Crystal Lake as well, and their personal issues and problems.

There was a little bit TOO much focus on marijuana usage throughout the film, to the point that it was just stupid. Besides the drugs though, the film retains the other two important parts of the franchise: sex and violence.

To start off with, there's plenty of nudity, and it's actually quite good nudity if I do say so myself. The violence and the gore wasn't as unique or original as the other films, but it still gets the job done.

I do have some complaints about the lighting though. During some of the coolest parts of the film, the lighting is just terrible, to the point that you can't even tell what's going on. Other than that, Friday the 13th does the series justice and it's a must-see for fans, as well as fans of Jared Padalecki, and I really hope we see more of Jason Voorhees in the future.",1248220800,,1699,4.3
236384,3,6300214087,"This is one of those movies that left die hard fans in disbelief that they could even possibly think to remake Friday The 13th. But it has happend, and as a huge fan of the original 12,000 movies, I was not looking forward to seeing how this restart was going to turn out.

In many ways, even as a die hard fan, I can admit that some of the original movies where pretty over the top, but there is a lot of fans who think the series died after part 4 or 5. But to me, I preferred Zombie Jason, and those cult followers or Kane Hodder, who they say was the best Jason, was part of those series of the Zombie Jason. But this movie was supposedly made by those who wanted it to go back to the original human Jason of the first 4 movies.

But putting that aside; How did this remake do?
The story changed from the first installment being about Jasons mother & Jason appearing at the end, then the rest of the movies are about him, and also the hockey mask doesn't come in till part 3, this relaunch shows snippets of Pamala Voorhees at the start, then the story is about Jason, who does where the potato sack for a while like in parts 2 to 3, then finds a hockey mask.

The story is not far from the original plots, Jason kills because his mother was beheaded and kills anyone trying to party and have sex in his territory. However, they have made Jason a bit smart now, instead of being a slow moving menace, he is a thinker now and lures the victims to do what he wants (or so the film makers claim)

I probably would have rated this higher, if they had not done things that just seemed way out of the Jason characters character. I really do not accept that Jason has kidnapped someone and keeping her a hostage. Even tho there is some little idea that because she holds a family necklace of the Voorhees and Jason thinks it's his sister or something, it just did not seem right. I can accept the new story, the smart thinking, the running, but the kidnapping thing just felt way out of place to me.

It's guaranteed there will be a sequel, but I really hope they do not make Jason into a kidnapper ever again, and I hope there will more sequels to the original movies. The originals just need to make it complete by going to at least part 13 and let this newer version do what they want.

The bonus features are pretty disappointing. There is the 7 best kills of the movie according to the cast and crew, the cast and crew dribbling on about what they thought when they first saw the Friday The 13th movies, and the new guy who plays Jason patting himself on the back every chance he gets to brag about how great he thinks he is playing Jason. And a few alternate scenes, but no deleted scenes? The alternates are interesting as to what ideas they had, but they show a small clip of scenes with Jason as a child seeing his mother die and carrying a machete, but yet that scene is not a deleted scene to see the whole thing. And the alternate version of Jason finding the hockey mask for the first time is not complete, it starts late and ends prematurely.

There isn't even trailers or an audio commentary, so I expect that this is only the first DVD release, and after a while they will release a 2 disc special edition, then gold platinum anniversary definitive directors-directors cut with a limited edition hockey mask keyring or something.

So my advice is, if your looking to buy, and really like bonus features, hold off till the next DVD release... and Hollywood wonder why they lose money from people downloading movies?",1248220800,2,3527,4.301204819277109
236385,4,6300214087,"Jason's return to the big screen is an enjoyable film for both longtime fans of Friday the 13th as well as general audiences. The acting and production values are superior to the average Friday flick, yet it still manages to maintain many of the guilty pleasures that draw people to these films. There is blood and gore aplenty and an amount of gratuitous (female) nudity that rivals late night HBO.

This is not to say the movie is perfect. The kills, while entertaining, could have been more unique. Some added character development for the second group of characters would have been beneficial as well.

As for the blu-ray, the video and audio are both superb. Sadly, the extras are a little sparse. The behind the scenes look at how they filmed the kills, while being entertaining and informative, is a little short. An in-depth look at the making of the film would have been a great addition to the disk. The deleted scenes are nothing special, although it should be mentioned that one gives viewers an alternate (and bloodier) scenario in which Jason gets his mask. The best feature of the blu-ray is that it provides both the theatrical and extended cut of the movie. It is a shame the studio did not provide the dvd with this feature.

The differences between the theatrical and ""killer"" cuts are about what you would expect for a movie like this. Some of the kills (most notably--and enjoyably--Trent's) are longer and bloodier.  The nude/sex scene at the beginning is longer, as is the now infamous Julianna Guill sex scene towards the end. There is also a little additional dialog and character development. The most notable difference is the addition of a chase/escape scene involving Amanda Righetti's character. These additions do make the film a harder R, but do not expect an entirely different movie.

For me personally, the movie is a welcome respite from the emergence of the ""torture-porn"" sub-genre within horror films.  Saw, its numerous sequels, and its imitators, have never appealed to me in the same way that slasher films do.",1247616000,5,2052,4.848571428571429

Having watched all the films, there is a certain expectation and I felt this newest installment neither added nor detracted from the original.

236408,4,6300214087,"An attractive young cast, a Jason who runs instead of walking, more exposed female flesh than most prior installments, and the new twist of having Jason move about the Crystal Lake area through underground tunnels.....  There you go -- that's the new F13 in a nutshell.

The ""Killer Cut"" runs a bit longer than the theatrical cut and includes more sex and violence, plus the minor plot point of a girl temporarily escaping her captor.

The 11-minute behind the scenes video was kind of interesting, especially for noting that the actor/stuntman who played Jason was actually regarded as the sweetest guy in the whole production.

Nana Visitor from ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" plays Jason's mom in a flashback sequence.

For me, the most interesting part of the DVD was the English subtitle track.  All the dialogue was subtitled, but there is a moment where one character was welcoming his guests to his lake cabin and he said ""Mi casa es su casa"" (My home is your home).  Now pretty much everyone who speaks English probably knows what that means.  What I found funny was that when he spoke the line the subtitle track read ""[Speaking Spanish]"".  Don't know why that struck me as funny, but it did.

If you've watched a fair number of subtitle tracks you know that during a scene where there is some ambient music playing (music whose source is in the movie itself), the subtitle track will usually say ""[music playing]"" just to let you know why, well, maybe why someone is dancing or something.  In THIS movie, however, there are two or three songs played as ambient music and instead of seeing ""[music playing]"" on the subtitles you see the name of the artist and the name of the song.  Can't decide it that was an artistic choice or if it was the subtitle track equivalent of in-movie record promotion.

None of the songs featured were ""I Get Around"" by The Beach Boys.  Too bad.  That would have been a good theme song for Jason Voorhees.  He certainly gets around.  He always seems to be in the right place at the right time.  Johnny-on-the-spot.  Always on time.  Very punctual.  If he ever got a straight job he could be FedEx employee of the month every month.

There are 13, count 'em, 13 main cast members. Go figure.",1247443200,,2229,4.6183206106870225
236409,3,6300214087,"This 2009 reboot plays out like a homage to the first few Friday the 13th films. While this should have been a smash hit, it's missing some of the primal ingredients that make a great slasher.

First off, the movie isn't scary. Jason (Derek Mears) has too much screen time which eliminates the threat of him randomly popping up and making you soil your BVDs. Next is the gore. Overall the kill scenes are OK, but nothing incredibly memorable (mainly machete kills). The setup is the series standard, college students looking for a 'nuthing but a good time' in the wrong place (with a missing person story weaved in). One portion that they really nail is the T&A. The movie is loaded with gorgeous honeys getting boned and nothing agitates Jason more than people banging...Jason Voorhees, keeping people celibate since 1981.

You can tell the filmmakers wanted to return to the series roots. For starters, Jason starts off wearing this makeshift head wrapping (a nod to Part II's burlap sack). Jason is more akin to the evil incarnate of Rambo than the brutish zombie he became in the later films. He keeps his machete uber sharp, possesses ""Robin of Loxley"" archery skills, and has a penchant for setting booby traps...these doped up, morally apprehensive idiots never stand a chance. The only standout is the lovable scumbag, Trent (Travis Van Winkle) who plays the jerky character perfectly. I was chomping at the bit to watch that Abercrombie playboy, get gutted. Clay (Jared Paledecki) is also decent as the hero looking for his sister, but the the rest of the cast is stereotypical, ethnically diverse, twenty-somethings that might as well be credited as victims #1-10.

The film has a propensity for bizarre and sometimes head-scratching scenes. For instance, Jason has a not-so-secret crop of bubonic chronic and he gets homicidal when hippie burnouts try to steal his herb. Another funny scene occurs when this topless bimbo, who looks like she still uses Velcro instead of shoelaces, turns into a professional wake-boarder. We also inexplicably discover that Jason has taken a camper hostage...it's just as bad as it sounds.

Friday the 13th is a decent reboot that is played WAY too safe by Marcus Nispel and Michael Bay. It hits the basic sweet spots fans are looking for: pretty actors, naked chicks, high body count and of course Jason. It's stupid fun, but it's a letdown that this big budget slasher is so by the numbers. This is essentially, ""Jason's Greatest Hits: The Early Years"" and it's a competent, albeit, flawed slasher that is sure to be followed by numerous vapid sequels.

First, this feels like part III because of the rehash of part II at the beginning, then moves through the prologue very quickly.  The ""main"" story feels like VI with a few twists thrown in.

This is definitely a new Jason, although subtly different than the predecessors.  This Jason chases people, not just doing the patented ""Michael Myers"" zombie walk, where you question how someone can flee at a dead run in the woods for quite some time, and then Jason, lumbering along, is somehow right behind them.  This Jason also has an explanation for how he moves from place to place so quickly (no spoilers).  This Jason is also quite clever, not just a zombified killer, but a hunter.

There are 2 sex scenes (rather explicit) and several extended female topless scenes.  Based on the reviews I had read, I expected much worse, but the sex scenes are only slightly more explicit than those of the original series, especially the later sequels.

There are multiple bloody deaths, and a couple of gory ones, but based on reviews I had read, I expected much more explicit gore.  Most of the deaths are of people being stabbed or otherwise impaled, with lots of blood but almost no guts.  There is one burn victim, and body parts here and there (no spoilers).

There is a lot of drug use depicted (marijuana), and that is my greatest concern.  The movie almost reinforces that drugs are bad, as all the drug users end up getting killed -- drug use seems to be one of Jason's ""triggers"".

I screened this yesterday, in the context of a parent of a teenage son, and I now have almost no concerns as long as I watch it with him.  He's already seen ALL of the original series, plus Jason vs. Freddy.  As a parent, based on the reading I had done, I told him there was NO WAY he was going to watch it until I watched it first, but my concerns have been alleviated.  If your kids are allowed to watch the other ""13th"" movies, there is ALMOST no difference -- the sex scenes are definitely SLIGHTLY more explicit, but the gore is more tame than some of the ""extreme"" deaths from the original series.  The biggest concern for me, and the main reason I'm watching it WITH my son, was the amount of drug use depicted in the film.

As a parent, I found almost no guidance among these comments, so I hope this helps.",1246838400,2,2558,4.448497854077253

236456,3,6300214087,"FRIDAY THE 13TH

I have been a fan of this series since the original like most people and like most people I was skeptical of this remake/revision/sequel/prequel or what ever this one is, get to that later. The thing about this flick is that while it keeps a lot of the good stuff from the originals it tries to be kinda fresh or something but a lot times it just seems out of place. This is not a horrible movie and since it was shot here in Texas, Austin that is, so I tend to forgive certain things.

The story is not really all that original but who thought it would be right; I guess you know what I am talking about. This movie is all about a big scary guy in an old school hockey mask that is killing off the young people of the world one annoying character at a time. This one sees a retelling of sorts of the death of his mother and goes right into Jason killing off a couple of pot heads, one of which has a brother looking for after these events. From here we follow her brother and a couple of kids that are out on Crystal Lake as they encounter Jason one at a time. So they get picked off after some sex, drugs, and well some more nudity, remember those horror movie rules.

The good about this movie is well for one it looks really good as the production value is high, so I guess that is a good thing. Also some times Jason running is actually pretty cool like the first time he does it in the film. But I guess the best thing is the kills in this film as if you didn't know that already. I have to admit that some of these deaths were really well done and actually turn out good, got to love ax's being thrown into people running. The direction by Marcus Nispel is on point for what this film is and that is a Jason flick so I got what I expected in that department, the script delivers on that as well but at times it fails in characters and such.

As for the bad well it is basically every other thing that I did not mention in the paragraph above. I don't know what it is about this flick but the acting just didn't seem real to me most of the time, at least some of the others had some good over the top acting. The characters just seem like rehashes of every other character from the previous films. I know I should not be so critical of that but come on at least make the characters interesting, I don't know maybe it's just me. Also I said earlier that the running thing was cool at times, well at others it just takes away from that mystic that Jason had in the earlier films. Remember when he would walk and just show up ahead of them, that was excellent [he did know the woods better]. Also what is the deal with the traps that he sets up all over the place if I remember correctly he was the one that fell for traps like in the beginning of ""JASON GOES TO HELL"". Also when did Jason become Leatherface with a little chamber under the house were he keeps girls that remind him of mommy.

Don't get me wrong this movie is not horrible and in fact people who did not like the previous films will most likely enjoy this one, it is just like all the other hit horror films as of late [all the same style and such]. Fans of the originals will enjoy this on some level if not only to see Jason doing his thing again. Also this is a remake of some kind but is really just a re imagining with all the new stuff [based on the first four films it seems]. But with that said it is a sequel to some and a prequel to others, sounds interesting or is that confusing?

We had a good time watching this flick and found it to be entertaining but it still didn't feel right. You may love this film while other may hate it, I lye some were in between those two extremes. Jason is still a very interesting character although he just doesn't seem as scary this go round, that quick thing is still kinda cool though at points. There will most likely be a sequel to this one with the same look and feel and like this one I will wait for the rental. Here's hoping the next one will be better, at least a four star one I hope.",1246665600,,4027,4.059119496855346
236457,4,6300214087,"It's been 29 years since Friday the 13th hit the screen. 29 years since people first heard the name Jason Voorhees. 29 years is a long time and this film has inspired, in that long time, several sequels, including a 2009 remake. But, does the original horror classic still hold up after 29 years? Surprisingly well actually.

Opening at Camp Crystal Lake in 1958, two young camp counselors are brutally murdered. Now, it's Present Day, Friday the 13th of June. Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer) is in the process of fixing up Camp Crystal Lake (called Camp Blood by the locals) and a new batch of counselors have arrived. But someone is killing them one-by-one.

It's a typical slasher-film setup with the familiar slasher-film stereotypes. There's Ralph, the town-crazy who warns everybody that crosses his path about the dangers of Camp Crystal Lake. Also, there's not a single actor in the film who went on to have a career of any sort, with the exception of a baby-faced Kevin Bacon, playing one of the potential victims.

Friday the 13th was such an influential horror film that it's hard to see the originality in it. In the rare case you haven't actually seen it yet, I can guarantee you've seen something pretty damned close to it. Everyone can tell you the ""ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma"" sound that plays throughout the film.

It was surprising to me that this film is still effective. The music, which no one ever seems to mention, is very effective and really eerie. It's a little reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho-Special-Edition-Universal-Legacy-Series/dp/B001CC7PP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho (Special Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)</a>, but it's not your typical, annoying '80s synthesizer score.

Also, the idea of using the camera to frame the perspective of the killer wasn't an entirely new idea, but it's used very well here.

Finally, despite it having the distinction of being a highly-parodied performance, Betsy Palmer is actually quite frightening in the few scenes she's in. It's not going to make your blood run cold or anything, but it works.

Besides introducing the world to one of the most iconic horror film characters of all time, one of the reasons Friday the 13th has held on much longer than other horror films is it's relative lack of carnage. There is quite a bit of blood, certainly but director Sean S. Cunningham utilizes suspense and atmosphere as well in order to terrify his audience. Rest assured blood & gore junkies...There is still enough here to keep you satisfied.

236458,4,6300214087,"When I first saw this in the movies, I was a bit dissappointed. However, the Killer Cut is nothing short of awesome.  My first exposures to F13 as a kid were part 3 and The Final Chapter.  Needless to say, it was those two films that I used as a standard to judge all others to follow--including Freddy vs Jason.  Here are just some of the reasons why I think this film is going to be hailed as one of the best films of the franchise:

JASON:  Ted White(Final Chapter) had always been my favorite; second was Richard Brooker(Part 3).  Kane Hodder was good, but the films he was in kind of sucked. Derek Mears has taken first place in my book.  His movements, frame and, speed (the running was a nice addition) combined to create a truly intimidating character.  The topper for this Jason is the fact that he is capable of plotting his next move versus simply being a linear killing machine...a sort of thinking man's Jason.

THE MUSIC: I haven't heard music create this much tension since the ambush sequence in Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses.

THE SETTING:  The underground tunnel idea worked perfectly.  It was believable and added depth to the story...Jason now has a reason for being able to pop up anywhere he likes without being detected.

The only thing that kept this from being a 5-star F13 was the ending.  Jason's demise, even in the Killer Cut verson, was sort of a let down.  It was sort of like going to see the fireworks as a kid, and one blazing trail of light flew up high into the sky only to fizzle out at the top instead of erupting into a brilliant shower of color and sound.  With that said, however, this film is worth having on your shelf!",1246492800,2,1667,4.398692810457517
236459,5,6300214087,"We, Sid the Elf, chose the ""reboot"" of the classic Friday the 13th with much excitement. It greatly exceded our expectations. Reboot is the perfect word for this film. It reworked a series of classics from 1980-1984 and targeted them for an audience that almost certainly wasn't around for this period. Basically, this film took the first 3 and part of 4 Fridays, summarized the basic plot points, changed a few settings, timeline and other elements(showing Jason getting the hockey mask)and introduced the great series to more than a few people for the first time.

Friday the 13th(2009) keeps pretty close to the important plot points of the early films in the series. And it boasts an impressive cast including: Robert Downey Jr. Jr., Wooderson's brother, and Dom Cruise Jr. The main difference is in the star of our show, Jason. This film erases every previous criticism of Jason. The killer in this film was smart, fast, lean, and seemingly impervious to anything less than a fatal injury. To Sid, Michael Myers is still el presidente of scariness, but this version of Jason is tough to make a case against.

There was a TON going on in this movie. The action never stopped. In fact, Sid thinks this film had perfect pace to it, especially for current times. In 1980, the pace of the original was fantastic, but this is a different day, 29 years later, in which attention spans are much shorter due to the internet, ipods, iphones, blackberries and everything else. So, maybe the story had to move much quicker for the target audience. It doesn't matter really because Sid loved this flick. The ""Nudity"" and ""Sexual Content"" warnings at the begining of the flick would have definitely roped us in back in the day and we would have stayed roped in until the end because, really, this is an excellent film. It even gets Drive-In Totals:

1 ""Motorin'"" apperance

1 finding of an unattended weed plant

1 joke about being baked

1 bow and arrow

6 breasts(2 of which are soooo primo)

236460,4,6300214087,"Yet another remake of an iconic horror classic, this 2009 remake has the same production team and director behind the 2003 remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre-2-Disc-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2-Disc Ultimate Edition)</a>. However, this remake also has Sean S. Cunningham, director of the 1980-original as producer; a good sign. This remake fails to deliver anything we haven't seen before and some of it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but luckily there's just enough to almost redeem it.

The film opens on Friday the 13th of June, the same day the original film take's place. In this opening scene, a young Jason watches a scared teenager decapitate his mother.

Next, it's present day and a group of young kids wander the woods near Crystal Lake. Twenty-three minutes later, we meet a whole new set of college kids on the way to a cabin near Crystal Lake. Meanwhile, a young man named Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) searches for his sister, who went missing six weeks earlier. The town bordering Crystal Lake consists of the same crazy redneck's that we saw in the TCM remake. All are unpleasant, paranoid, and tend to give main characters vague warnings about Jason, while doing nothing about it.

I don't see director Marcus Nispel being big on ideas, as I'm sure his influence went into creating the townsfolk. This film also shares a very similar visual style with TCM, as well as having the cheap scares that populated that film.

Friday the 13th isn't much different from most recent horror films. It has plenty of gratuitous nudity and violence. This doesn't bother me, but this movie gives ""gratuitous"" a whole meaning, believe me. It also has two character's that serve as comic relief (in this case, Aaron Yoo and Arlen Escarpeta), but I actually welcomed them.

There is some good in this remake, extending beyond creative death scenes. First of all, Jason looks more frightening than he ever has before. The makeup and costume design are top notch, but actor Derek Mears brings physical movement and posturing to the performance which really adds to the effect. Furthermore, the script makes Jason human rather than some supernatural being. This is good, but the writers stopped short at any attempt to explore the character's psyche. Finally, it has a genuinely likable protagonist in Padalecki.

There's almost no room for originality in the horror genre anymore. Sequels, remakes, and rip-offs are essentially what rules it now. Friday the 13th does not bring anything new to the table, but taken on it's own merit it's not that bad. It's much better than the dreadful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-X-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B00006FI0R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason X (New Line Platinum Series)</a>&nbsp;and the disappointing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freddy-vs-Jason-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B0000VCZMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freddy vs. Jason (New Line Platinum Series)</a>. While those who've had their fill of Jason at this point will want to steer clear of this movie, it's actually better than quite a bit of the horror films that are released today. If you don't mind being entertained by something you've seen before, Friday the 13th isn't the worst way to waste your time.

236463,2,6300214087,"This is more a review for those who aren't wholly dedicated or even really familiar with the original Friday the 13th film series. I have never seen any of the original movies apart from the terrible Jason X which I come to understand has nothing really to do with the Jason mythology. This rehashing of the series for me was a perfect way to try and understand the crazed attraction to the Jason character and the infamous hockey mask. I was hoping to go into this film and really enjoy it as a stand alone piece. Fans of the original series were going to be naturally critical of the film, because it's a restart of the original series, but telling it in a new way. Because I've not seen most of the original films, nor do I hold any loyalty to the original series, I can guess that I had a bit of an advantage as I had no pre-conceived ideas of what to expect. That aside, I supremely hated the film and found watching it a chore.

The first part of the film introduces Jason as the deformed child of a mother who has gone on a killing spree of all the counsellors of camp Crystal Lake for allowing the drowning of Jason. The opening credits show Jason's mother facing her final victim on her murderous revenge rampage, but is decapitated by the last counsellor with a machete. Jason approaches the headless body of his mother, takes the machete and silently vows to kill anyone who dare step foot near Crystal Lake. Fast forward a few years and we meet a few campers who stumble upon Crystal Lake and are all brutally murdered by Jason, except one girl by the name of Whitney who is taken captive by the killer. Fast forward again and we're introduced to a group of annoying college students who are staying in the log cabin of the parents of their friend Trent (Travis Van Winkle). Whilst on their journey to the cabin, they meet the brother of Whitney searching for her, Clay (Jared Padalecki) and soon discover that all is not well.

I honestly can't tell you everything I hated about this film, but I can honestly say the worst thing about it was the cast. They're the type of irritating people you see on shows such as Dawson's Creek and The Hills. Maybe it was deliberate as they became so insufferable I actually wanted them to die at the brutal hands of Jason Voorhees. There is not one character I found myself hoping would survive as they each caused me to hate them in individually vicious ways. By around the half way mark, I acquiesced to the notion that I wasn't going to like the characters, so just enjoyed the fact that the majority of them would die at some point. Once the rise of Jason story was told, the film simply comprised of 3 different things; murder, sex and swearing. They are all great when put together properly, but this film is made for an entirely unimaginative audience and I found myself resenting the film as the minutes dragged on by.

Possibly the only good thing about the film was Derek Mears as Jason. He had the character worked down to a tee including the posture, movements and frighteningly cool persona. Frankly this was not enough to save the film as everything bad about it just clouded Mears' performance. If you're a fan of the slasher movies, then you will probably like it as that's certainly all it was good for. Even the cheap nudity was dull and un-entertaining, so for movie go-ers who enjoy a good film, with good acting, good script and good setting, I would advise you to keep away from this one for as long as you can.",1246060800,4,3483,4.4390625

Upon my first viewing of Friday the 13th I wrote a rather negative review of it, but seeing it for the 2nd time I have to say my first review of the movie was a bit harsh. Don't really go into Friday the 13th as a remake, but it just takes the basic premise and creates its own story, but doesn't really ignore what came before. If someone really wanted to Friday the 13th 09 could probably be linked in with the first 4 movies and while plot holes are bound to appear as a whole this series is pretty much known for that even in direct continuations.

The basic concept of Friday the 13th is taking the basic elements of the first 4 as a template and taking it in a slightly new and updated direction. The first 4 I thought were far better than most people give them credit for; while at the end of the day they were body count films they also had decent characters and some nice suspense and tension and maybe a good scare or two. But after that the remainder of the series became nothing more than simply mindless splatter flicks, but were still enjoyable; well at least the Paramount installments, anything after that was either decent or horrible.

The fact this movie goes back to the style of the first 4 I suppose my expectations were too high, while I wasn't expecting a cinematic masterpiece I did feel letdown by how the movie turned out. But seeing it for a second time Friday the 13th has grown on me and some of the problems I originally had with it are still there when all was said and done it served its purpose as a fun splatter flick.

The Friday the 13th formula is quite easy; good looking cast, some nudity, fun kill scenes and some gore; this is the basic formula for any splatter flick actually and once New Line took over the series they strayed from that formula and the movies suffered. Friday the 13th 09 goes back to that very simple formula, but does mess it up in some areas. But the movie also serves as a decent throwback to the splatter flicks of the 80s and at times has that feel. Once the 80s ended the slasher flick all, but died with every so often a decent one coming around and Friday the 13th is one of the better slasher flicks to come around, which isn't saying much I guess.

The screenplay by Damian Shannon & Mark Swift is rather weak in a lot of areas. Shannon & Swift aren't nearly as funny and entertaining as they seem to think they are. But what I will give these guys credit for they know how to write a popcorn flick and they do that rather well. The characters are faceless and rather obnoxious and are probably better off dead. The Friday the 13th movies may not be known for their screenplays and character development, but the early movies had poor scripts in general, but they were able to create decent characters and were overall decent enough to keep the viewer some what entertained in-between the death scenes.

But even if some of the early ones had faceless victims again they at least had some likeable characters as well, but Shannon & Swift are mostly unable to create much for the characters and that's why I said they were all pretty much better off dead. None of the characters really stand out where as despite what most people say the original actually had solid characters each with their own personality. Here they all pretty much blend in with each other and well again are faceless victims. The biggest problem though I had is some of the jokes really fall flat; the token black guy is prime example. All this might have been funny back when Kevin Williamson came up with these jokes, but 12-years afterwards it's really not funny anymore.

The characters in the opening act were the most interesting and had the movie focused on them I think the script would have turned out better. I don't wanna just sit here and trash Shannon & Swift since at the end of the day they do write a fun script and they know what their audience wants and they deliver that and these two guys clearly understand the slasher genre, but I do feel as if their script didn't turn out as good as it could have. But in the end they get the job done and I guess that's all that matters.

Director Marcus Nispel made a name for himself with the remake of the horror classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was a decent flick. It wasn't a bad movie, but I can't say it was very good either. When all is said and done it was a fun time killer. Nispel fairs better with Friday the 13th, but as much as this movie follows the first 4 it also strays from the series and certain aspects have that Friday the 13th fell, but more often than not I thought it seemed more like a sequel to Nispel's take on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

What I really liked is how Jason was more like he was in 2-4 well sort of. Starting with the 6th part Jason became pretty much a walking idiot who just appeared and hacked people up. But in 2-4 he was a lot more human like; due to the damage he takes in part 3 he cannot be called human, but does have human qualities and features. Friday the 13th 09 goes back to that concept; Jason like in those installments wasn't the smartest, but he was hardly the walking idiot he became. Though my main problem is since when does Jason take hostages?? Remake, sequel, prequel or reboot it doesn't matter you have to stay true to the character. And while Friday the 13th 09 mostly stays true to that it does stray in some areas like Jason taking hostages and using people as bait to lure out others. While all this can be looked over, but as much as Jason is like he was in 2-4 the little changes were the ones that bothered me the most and to be honest reminds me a lot of Leatherface is Nispel's TCM.

Like Shannon & Swift, Nispel knows what his audience wants and mostly delivers on that. The pacing is actually fairly good; the movie runs at a nice quick pace and the running time goes by rather quickly. Despite any flaws I can't say this was ever boring. The suspense level is fairly decent at times. While Nispel never really creates a lot of suspense some scenes have a little bit. The biggest problem is the direction is by the books and is slasher filmmaking 101, which works in some areas, but it feels like every other slasher flick with nothing new attempted at all.

Again I'll go back to the first 4 films despite what people say those movies weren't just made as mindless splatter flicks. The makers attempted some suspense and tension with a couple of scares. The death scenes here lack any real tension and the set ups while good a bit too clichd. Nispel though does manage to create a dark tone for the film, but the deaths just lacked a bit with any suspense and tension; the comedy also takes away from that. I have no problems with comedy in horror, but when it comes time to scare the audience drop the comedy. The death in the tool shed was one of the best kill scenes of the series, but the lame attempt at comedy slightly takes away from it, which I suppose is more on the writers than the director.

Friday the 13th was well made though I'll give Nispel that; he may lack some originality, but can deliver a well made and shot movie. The kills are quite solid even if they lack suspense, but while maybe a better director could have gotten a bit more out of the movie when all is said and done Marcus Nispel is able to deliver for the most part.

The one area Friday the 13th delivers on is sex and nudity, which has been a staple of the slasher flick since the 80s and started earlier with the Giallos of the 70s. The Friday the 13th flicks had sex and nudity, but not as much as one would be led to believe, but this one has a lot. The cast is good looking and this installment features the best looking women of the entire series and thankfully most of them have no problems with showing a lot of skin. The actual performances weren't bad; Jared Padalecki as Clay was fairly good, but a little stiff in some areas. Clay was sort of like Rob in The Final Chapter, but overall Padalecki delivers a mostly strong performance.

Danielle Panabaker as Jenna delivers a strong, but slightly boring performance. The problem was more of she was never really given a whole lot to work with and is the standard final type girl we've seen plenty of times. But Panabaker does well with what she's given to work with. Amanda Righetti is pretty good as Whitney even though her role is mostly contained to the opening and closing act. Travis Van Winkle as Trent though was the stand out; while his character is the typical jerk we've seen many times, Travis is able to make a lot more out of it. Nana Visitor as Mrs. Voorhees plays a very small part, but it's mostly forgettable.

The rest of the cast weren't bad by any means, but they aren't developed enough at all to make much of an impact. Typical slasher flick characters and they all sort of blend in with each other and that's why I go back to the faceless victims. Julianna Guill though manages to stand out and be memorable, but I think that has more to do with her nudity rather than her character, Julianna delivers a strong performance, but her character is never developed at all, but she's extremely hot and is naked so at the end of the day who really cares about the character?

Derek Mears made for an alright, but mostly forgettable Jason; he plays the role more like Richard Brooker of Part III and Ted White in The Final Chapter, but unlike those two he's never really as creepy. I don't think Mears was the worst Jason, but he was far from the best, which maybe had more to do with his director, but who knows. I liked the fact Derek played the character more like Brooker and White my two favorites with Brooker as my favorite, but he doesn't really have the presence those two guys had. Like I said Derek Mears was alright, which might have more to do with how he was used, but I did like his take on Jason more the 2nd time around.

Overall Friday the 13th had the potential to turn out a lot better; using the first 4 movies as the template was an excellent idea, but it never manages to be as good as it had the potential to be, but for the most part the movie does serve its purpose as a fun slasher flick. By no means is this anywhere near the best of the series, but far from the worst as well. For me this is the kind of movie that improves on multiple viewings, but I still have the same complaints, but I was able to mostly look past them and enjoy the movie for what it was.

As for the Blu-ray release it's nothing special. The picture is excellent and the sound is good, but nothing great. The extras are quite weak with a couple of weak behind the scenes the 7 Best Kills feature though was excellent.",1245974400,3,11020,4.345162858531842
236465,1,6300214087,"Friday the 13th (Marcus Nispel, 2009)

Six years ago, music video director Marcus Nispel (who has worked with acts as diverse as Billy Joel and Bone Thugs n Harmony) gave us one of the biggest surprises of the current Hollywood horror climate, which often seems to consist of nothing other than sequels, remakes, and ripoffs, with the smart, witty, and actually scary remake of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. So when I heard he was jumping in to direct the newest installment of the seemingly neverending Friday the 13th series (do you really think it's going to stop at thirteen? Nah, me neither), I was excited, with some reservations; I haven't actually liked a Friday the 13th movie, at least not for any of the reasons you're actually supposed to like a movie, since the second one (though I watch a good number of them for the sheer cheesiness of the thing). Then I actually saw this twelfth installment, and I'm impressed, though for all the wrong reasons. How does one go from directing one of the best of the current remakes to what is, unarguably, the worst of them?

I'm not even going to bother with a plot synopsis, because if you've seen one of these flicks, you've seen them all. Except that the screenwriters, Damian Shannon and Mark Swift (who did the series proud, relatively, with Freddy vs. Jason), decided they were going to mess with the conventions--not of the genre, necessarily, but of this particular series in one very large, and entirely unexplained, way. It's obvious from the get-go that this change was made in order to cater to a different audience than the other movies in the series have been. Whose brilliant idea was this? It's also worth noting that, with the exception of Freddy vs. Jason, which was never meant to be canon in the first place, the ten films in the series have all followed a definite progression. This one breaks that progression entirely, and with no in-film acknowledgement of where it should be in the series, the only logical conclusion is that the people who made this film couldn't have cared less about the existing canon, which leaves ""making a quick buck"" as the only reason anyone was involved in the first place.

Putting aside the larger considerations of making a series film, did anyone, including the actors, actually look at the script before filming began? I'm not sure they did. Not that it really mattered with the passel of actors we have here. I rather liked Aaron Yoo's character in here, but listen to the delivery on his first spoken line. The hickory I used to smoke the hamburgers last night had more personality. None of the characters in this film were, of course, more than cardboard cutouts in the first place, and I fully expected that, but at least the first couple of movies had decent actors portraying the cardboard cutouts.

I don't even like the series all that much, so I'm not entirely sure why I was as deeply offended by everything that's so painfully wrong with this movie, and yet I am. I've probably seen worse movies this year, but I can't think of any offhand. (zero)",1245974400,3,3067,4.695167286245353

But it has all of the elements of your classic 80's slasher. I am a big fan of horror movies in general and Jason is one of my favorites. This movie was great because it had little elements from other Friday the 13th movies. I really enjoyed picking those out as I watched.

I read the reviews before I bought it and a lot of them at the time were less than favorable. I can agree with them and thank them for getting me ready to watch this movie and actually enjoy it. It is not a remake as we were initially led to believe but it is a perfect addition to the franchise. Think of it this way, it is a million times better than Jason X. If you are looking for a fun classic slasher film then this is for you. Sit back, enjoy and try not to over think it. It is a slasher film after all, not a drama fighting for an Oscar.

With that being said, I do NOT recommend the DVD.  This DVD is completely bare bones and has no special features, no commentary, just the movie.  If you want the special features, you have to purchase either the ""Killer Cut"" DVD (which does not contain the theatircal version of the film) or the blu-ray version.

Granted, the description doesn't say that it contains special features.  However, I just assumed it would contain special featues, considering I know of no other big budget new movies released on DVD that don't contain special features.  Older movies released on DVD sometimes don't have special features, but not newer movies, particularly the ones that are bigger budgets.

I have no problem with vieweing alternative cuts of movies.  However, when I purchase a DVD of a movie I like, I prefer to buy the version I saw in theaters.  I don't like being forced to purchase a second version just to get special features.  Nor do I like being forced to purchase a blu-ray player just to see those special features.

The writers and producers of this film were very vocal during the production and promotion of this film in saying that this is NOT a remake. I actually have a video interview of Daemon Shannon & Mark Swift saying that this film is most definitely not a remake. The studio wanted to repackage & re-market the character of Jason-i.e. TCM, Rob Zombie's Halloween, Dark Knight, etc. This was originally slated to be and origins film like Halloween. But what they ultimately decided to do was what the James Bond franchise has been doing for years. Casino Royal and The Quantum of Solace are not remakes of any James Bond film. Nor are they intended to be sequels to the Pierce Brosnan pictures. They are simply new James Bond films that exist in a sort of parallel time line where suddenly it's the year 2006 and there's a new actor playing bond. That's essentially what this Friday the 13th film is. It's not a remake. Jason isn't even alive and grown in the original film. It's more like an update.",1245801600,2,1091,4.515151515151516

236503,3,6300214087,"The Friday the 13th series has never been known to be anything more than a pretty cool looking horror icon (Jason Voorhees) and a series of inventive death sequences and gore FX....don't get me wrong I happen to think Jason is a pretty scary guy, but for some reason I feel he has never reached his potential on screen.

Even though none of these films are all that great, I do like Jason and most of the films are entertaining for what they are. I watched both the theatrical release and ""killer cut"" of the 2009 installment and found both to be disappointing only because I felt they could have brought the series to another level that the character deserves.

This is a slicker looking film and Jason is a bit faster, but it's pretty much the same old thing. This film is better than at least a couple of the Friday installments with some nice gratuitous gore and nudity even in the theatrical version!

The killer extended cut has longer gore sequences at least that's all that I noticed. The way Jason gets his trademark hockey mask is also the same, but they do give you an alternate scene where they changed how it happens. I don't know why they changed it as I actually liked it better!

The unrated release has two short extras about 10 minutes each which are deleted scenes and a feature-ette. These two extras are short, but considering the theatrical version has nothing!...not even a trailer, you should buy this version as it is the better of the two cuts of the film. My favorite scene is when Jason is running down a victim and he throws an axe into his back!....very nice!

236504,2,6300214087,"This is more a review for those who aren't wholly dedicated or even really familiar with the original Friday the 13th film series. I have never seen any of the original movies apart from the terrible Jason X which I come to understand has nothing really to do with the Jason mythology. This rehashing of the series for me was a perfect way to try and understand the crazed attraction to the Jason character and the infamous hockey mask. I was hoping to go into this film and really enjoy it as a stand alone piece. Fans of the original series were going to be naturally critical of the film, because it's a restart of the original series, but telling it in a new way. Because I've not seen most of the original films, nor do I hold any loyalty to the original series, I can guess that I had a bit of an advantage as I had no pre-conceived ideas of what to expect. That aside, I supremely hated the film and found watching it a chore.

The first part of the film introduces Jason as the deformed child of a mother who has gone on a killing spree of all the counsellors of camp Crystal Lake for allowing the drowning of Jason. The opening credits show Jason's mother facing her final victim on her murderous revenge rampage, but is decapitated by the last counsellor with a machete. Jason approaches the headless body of his mother, takes the machete and silently vows to kill anyone who dare step foot near Crystal Lake. Fast forward a few years and we meet a few campers who stumble upon Crystal Lake and are all brutally murdered by Jason, except one girl by the name of Whitney who is taken captive by the killer. Fast forward again and we're introduced to a group of annoying college students who are staying in the log cabin of the parents of their friend Trent (Travis Van Winkle). Whilst on their journey to the cabin, they meet the brother of Whitney searching for her, Clay (Jared Padalecki) and soon discover that all is not well.

I honestly can't tell you everything I hated about this film, but I can honestly say the worst thing about it was the cast. They're the type of irritating people you see on shows such as Dawson's Creek and The Hills. Maybe it was deliberate as they became so insufferable I actually wanted them to die at the brutal hands of Jason Voorhees. There is not one character I found myself hoping would survive as they each caused me to hate them in individually vicious ways. By around the half way mark, I acquiesced to the notion that I wasn't going to like the characters, so just enjoyed the fact that the majority of them would die at some point. Once the rise of Jason story was told, the film simply comprised of 3 different things; murder, sex and swearing. They are all great when put together properly, but this film is made for an entirely unimaginative audience and I found myself resenting the film as the minutes dragged on by.

Possibly the only good thing about the film was Derek Mears as Jason. He had the character worked down to a tee including the posture, movements and frighteningly cool persona. Frankly this was not enough to save the film as everything bad about it just clouded Mears' performance. If you're a fan of the slasher movies, then you will probably like it as that's certainly all it was good for. Even the cheap nudity was dull and un-entertaining, so for movie go-ers who enjoy a good film, with good acting, good script and good setting, I would advise you to keep away from this one for as long as you can.",1245715200,3,3483,4.4390625

236556,1,6300214087,"Did you know a horror franchise drowned a day before this week? The Producer and Directer weren't paying any attention... They were counting their money while that cult icon drowned. It's name was Friday the 13th. I watching the night it happened. Losing my temper... there. I was a fan. Friday the 13th should have been awesome. Every minute! It was... It wasn't a very good remake. We can give up now... fans.

You see Friday the 13th was my favorite movie... and today it was raped.

I mistakingly had high expectations of this movie. Of course I was bothered by the fact that Marcus Nispel, who did such a smash up job on Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, was directing. In fact besides the fact that Jason wore a hockey mask, had an affinity for machetes and his mother was in it for five seconds. It was almost impossible to differentiate between the two movies. Lots of slack jawed yokels and shaky camera action in the dark, just like Chainsaw. Poor story telling with numerous loose ends, just like Chainsaw. Terrible adaptation, just like Chainsaw.

Okay, maybe I'm being a little too hard on the movie. The first few minutes of the movie were incredible. Of course there' no rhyme or reason to Jason's return from the grave, but they never had one in the original either. The elements that they took from the first four movies were there, and yes I said 'Four' movies. There were elements from the Final Chapter despite what the propaganda says. The acting wasn't terrible. Yoo's character was probably the funniest character to ever be in a Friday the 13th to date. The under the dock kill was so classic that it felt like it belonged and it was good to see Jason in his old sack mask again.

Many key elements were there, but only for a second or two. Mrs. Voorhees head wasn't really elaborated on and wouldn't be seen as significant to anyone who hadn't seen the original movies. Despite all the hype about how Jason gets his hockey mask in this movie, it was a big let down and just seemed a little too convenient (though the cut scene explaining how he got it was worse). The locals in the town were basically rejects from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. In fact the scenery may have appeared New Englandish... but the locals just screamed, ""I'm from Texas!""

Jason Voorhees. How could they screw up a character like Jason Voorhees? Give these folks a hand though. They did it. I started to realize that Jason wasn't quite himself around the sleeping bag death scene. First and foremost Jason is a killer, not a sadistic torturer. Sure he's done some pretty brutal things to his victims but roasting a person alive just isn't his style. It's too much set up for Jason honestly. Additionally, if Jason has you on the ground with a machete coming down at you, you are DEAD. He doesn't lock you in his basement and keep you alive for months because you're a pretty girl who looks like his mother. Jason kills. And he especially kills if you impersonate his mother.

The end... in more ways than one. When I watched the ending of this movie I literally had the feeling that I was ripped off. The pay off with the wood chipper wasn't even utilized here. And then for some reason the survivor(s), another thing that was lame, decided to dump his body in the lake. This means they had to actively decide it was a good idea to get rid of the evidence that they were not the manics that killed a bunch of people, but it also means that they had to take Jason out of the chipper, take the chain off his neck, remove his mask, and carry him all the way out to the dock. And if Jason was playing possum the entire time, why didn't he just kill them when he still had access to a wood chipper and a barn full of tools?

In fact this movie raised nothing but questions. Who killed Mrs. Voorhees? What ever happened to her? Why did Jason miraculously come back from the dead? Why was his body still intact after all those years in the lake? Why does Jason wear a mask? How did he keep the rats from eating his mother's head? Why did the local cops not bother investigating anything? How did Jason learn to hook up electricity to his camp? Why didn't the power company notice an abandoned summer camp is sucking juice off the grid? Why would Jason keep some girl chained up in his basement? Why did they bother doing makeup for Jason when they show his face for maybe two frames of the whole movie? Why does Jason pop out of the lake at the end with his mask on? What were they thinking? Why did I see this miserable attempt to remake a great movie? Why am I wasting more time on a bad review? Why are you still reading?

The film starts off on how this all started on why Jason's mother was killing people at Camp Crystal Lake and then what happens after His mother's head get hacked off from there on in it gets nasty.

This is in my view the best Friday The 13th I have seen the 4th film, because this goes back to it's roots, the first 4 films were burtal and damn right scary, which I felt was lost from 5 onward when it got campy but I still like all the films but that just what I felt about them.

This take on Jason is that he is more nasty but he knows what he is doing in some way he was like a hunter that can run this but still was a burtal killing machine he always was.

So all in all is a vintage return to form for Jason and the Friday The 13th franchise with plenty of scares and nasty kills so if you are a fan of the franchise or are new to it you will enjoy nonetheless.",1245456000,2,1060,3.8486238532110093

236563,1,6300214087,"Being a huge fan of Jason and The Friday The 13th movies, I was looking foward to this movie. Instead, what I watched was without a doubt in my mind the worst horror film of all time.

As a ""re-imagining"" of Jason, there was a lot to go on. The opening scene with a girl chopping off Jason's mother head, with better acting and in a black and white style then the original, made the movie seem like it was going to be pretty good.

Following this, a disaster follows. We are introduced to a group of teenagers who decide to camp out near Crystal Lake. They proceed to do nothing for about ten minutes. Then Jason starts showing up, and he proceeds to stab everyone. The gore is not that bloody. A couple characters go inside of what appears to be Jason's version of Casanova's house from ""Kiss The Girls,"" or Jigsaw's hideaway in ""Saw III."" When the best thing about this segment is Jason wearing the sack over his head that he wore in ""Friday The 13th: Part 2"", it becomes obvious that something is seriously wrong with this Jason movie.

This is where one of the biggest problems of the movie arise. His tunnels and house tear apart the Jason we all know and love. In that sense, this ""re-imagining,"" fails in every possible way.

But it doesn't end there. Every one of these deaths, whether it be the first or the last, use gore effects that are basic (a little blood from the neck that looks like water poors) and boring. With all the technology development in make-up/gore effects, you'd think they would've taken full advantage of it and did a better job on them than even Freddy vs. Jason. Instead, they are minimal, and not anywhere near impressive. The machete is never red after going through someone, nor do they bleed out. And isn't that one of the points to even watch these movies?

The title ""Friday The 13th"" shows up on the screen like 20 minutes in, and the movie seems to start all over. We are introduced to another bunch of teenagers, most whom are going on a vacation to one kids Father's house, which is covered in various hunting trophies. All of these characters are hundred times more cliche than any of the ones from the previous movies, complete with the modern day annoying Asian, a black guy who keeps saying ""It's because I'm black"", a guy who is abnoxious, a slutty girl, and a girl who doesn't know why she's with them.

Then there is the other guy, whom is looking for his sister who went missing a month before. It is obvious she was killed by Jason, and you can somewhat feel sorry for him. He is the only character who is even remotely interesting, as all the others fail to even be remotely amusing.
Failing to do that has this movie fail on a whole other level, effectively being far worse than even the worst of the pointless horror films, perhaps even worse than Uwe Boll's ""House Of The Dead.""

The movie proceeds to be very boring for about another forty minutes, with one or two people whom have no relevance to the movie (not the teenagers) are offed. Jason finds his mask under a sheet after killing a man obsessed with weed, and all watching are supposed to go ""Ooooh!!!"" But instead, no one cares, because it was a very stupid, typical way to find his mask that anyone could've come up with.

Whether before or after, he also captures a girl, ties her up, and we see him sharpening his blade. Again, the watcher of this movie is supposed to think ""Brillance,"" in the area of re-invention. Instead, Jason's image is once again tarnished, this time with a huge mistake on his intelligence, and him not killing someone, which he would never do.

Later he starts offing the kids. One is shot with an arrow on the boat, but everyone else is stabbed or slashed with his machete. EVERY SINGLE ONE. He does the same thing over and over, stabbing each one with a stupid look and poor movement while chasing them for a second. There are no running and falling over scenes in the woods. And there is no mystery; more than half the characters know Jason is out and killing and they proceed to run outside and get stabbed, just like the last one.

The only good death in this whole movie is the Asian kid, whom is stabbed slowly, and is welcome as he is the most irritating character.

After everyone but the girl who was captured and the main boy who knows Jason killed his sister, they end up back in his ""House of horrors"" and the movie goes back to the same stupidity displayed in the first segment of the movie.

Another terribly weak link of the movie is the guy playing Jason. How hard is it to walk around like a stone, chase people, and walk slowly towards them in a creepy way? It's not, but whomever is playing him this time (not Kane Hodder, whom should be in this role)is horrible. His moments are beyond painful to watch, as Jason seems just like every other killer out there, nothing unique by any stretch of the imagination.

The climax of this movie has the two characters hanging Jason, which by now, everyone knows will not work. But it is a decent scene, until his head is not crushed in what looks like a belt built inside of the wall. At least this would've given the audience the closure that he wouldn't come back for a while, and these characters would survive. But without that closesure, we know he'll be back in about a second.

They both play the ""happy ending"" scene and sit out on the dock. This is after throwing Jason in the water, whom I would've ran a million miles away from was I in their situation. Then he jumps out of the water, grabs the girl, and the movie ends. Wow, what a non-twist, and what a disaster.

By this end, you also add to the wonders of just why this movie is so bad of why you were forced to play ""Where's Jason"" the whole movie. His screen-time is very minimal, and every moment with him was worse than the last.

The only conclusion one human being could come up with is what was so hard about making a Jason movie? Or rather, why is this not a Jason movie? Where are the inventive deaths (choking a girl while holding her up, knocking a guy's head off with one hit, a weed wacker)? What happened to Jason, the zombie who kills teenagers? Where are the tons of deaths? Where is Jason? More so than any, why did they ever make this horrible, horrible movie?

The result of surviving through all 1 hour and 46 minutes of this movie is having witnessed one of the worst pieces of garbage ever captured on screen.
""Friday The 13th: Killer Cut"" is a unbelievably bad movie, and even worse Friday The 13th film. It misunderstands Jason in every way possible. It makes the original, very ovverated movie as well as The Final Chapter look like the greatest movies of all time.
DO NOT ever watch this movie, for you will be forced through the reason why so many non-horror fans make fun of the genre. It resembles the very poison that infects many, overly popular horror movies that only fuels horror movie haters, as well as a fungus that you may never beable to get off the entire rest of the ""Friday The 13th"" series.
Save yourself and watch ""Freddy vs. Jason,"" a true resemblance of what both title characters are meant to be. You won't regret this choice.",1245369600,2,7146,4.409711684370258

An exciting and thrilling reboot of the popular yet critically bashed Friday The 13th series as it brings it back to it's roots. Director Marcus Naspiel who directed the decent ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake in 2003 and producers Sean S. Cunningham with Michael Bay brings the series on it's feet again in a whole different way, it's not really a remake in the traditional sense but a semi-remake/semi-sequel remix combine that pays tribute to the first four movies of the series including using references to them. I really like the concept of having the first four movies of the F13 series as the basis for the film including a brief origin of Jason on how he became the killer he is unlike what Rob Zombie's attempt at ""Halloween"" was but making Jason a bit faster and meaner just like his human non-zombie counterpart in parts 2 3 and Final Chapter. The film does have a playful sense of self-referential humor about sex, drugs and alcohol this side of ""Scream"" and has some good gory murders shown, it's nice to see the series gets back on track and can't wait for the sequel.

Also, the kills seemed more like TCM ones than F13 ones, except the one at the dock, by far my favorite and most F13 flavored.  Jason just seemed crueler in this film than the previous versions.  With those criticisms aside, I did enjoy this movie very much.  I am thrilled that Platinum Dunes has made this movie.",1245369600,,721,4.242647058823529
236608,4,6300214087,"Oddly enough i found myself enjoying this movie quite a bit, sure there were a few parts towards the end where i wanted to fast forward, but nothing to make me wanna shut it off. This movie is far far superior to the absolutely horrid My Bloody Valentine, which is about the worst attempt at a horror flick i've ever seen. Anyways moving on here is a short review using pros and cons about the movie.

PROS
*The actors can actually act, some better than others.
*The comical parts are actually funny, (one is unintentional as a body flies from the window above and smashes a windshield mr TOUGH blonde guy screams like a girl)! I rewond it a few times!
*Its scary in a very realistic tense way.
*Jason looks bigger and badder than ever, the way he finds his mask in this film is very cool.
*All the characters have there own unique personality, and the girls aren't just stupid bimbos who run.
*It actually HAS a plot, the guy who is looking for his sister gone missing.
*Bloody but not even nearly as bad as a movie like CRANK-HIGH VOLTAGE.
*The over all atmosphere and production(direction) is well executed.
*Great looking girls(much better than the 80's and 90's) with a few great sex scenes:)

CONS
*Every actor except maybe 3 look like they just stepped out of GQ or Vogue magazine(put at least one fatty in there).
*Some obvious cliche' parts of why didn't they just swim to the other side, or why didn't they just run(faster), or hide.
*Some of the killing scenes are a bit drawn out(die already).
*Jason has become an expert archer.(laughs)
*The people you do think will survive do survive,(well sorta)
*Some of the script seems a little off in places, or confused.
*A few parts don't make sense, plot wise.
*The usual, he kills everyone very very easily except one person who always seems to be the toughest.
*Also Friday the 13th, is NEVER mentioned in this movie.

Other than the for mentioned which can easily be overlooked, unlike a lot of horror films, it really is a worth while watch. I watched it the first time alone, but plan on watching it with a group, or just one girl, at some point. So though i'm not a big splatter horror fan(more of a psychological horror buff) this was not bad at all. Just a few usual cliche's and a few plot mistakes here and there. Also the people are just a little TO beautiful, but hey isn't that what a good horror film is all about. Good looking people must be easier to kill!!! HA.

PS-Jasons last name is not mentioned either, same dude? Who knows. Plus sometimes in this he's an emotional little big ole psychopath. Poor Jas.",1245369600,29,2580,4.494669509594883
236609,3,6300214087,"I have to say I am only a casual `slasher' horror film fan, and while this genre of horror isn't exactly my favorite, murderous rampaging psychos always had their charm. After Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"", we knew it would only be a matter of time until Hollywood re-imagined everybody's favorite hockey-masked murderer, Jason. 2009's ""FRIDAY THE 13TH"" is more of a reboot than a remake. The film is co-produced by Michael Bay and directed by Marcus Nispel (yep, the same dude responsible for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake) Honestly, if you wanted to know how this film could fit into the current ""Friday"" mythos--I would say nowhere but somewhere between parts 2 and 3, maybe even before part 4; because of some references. The film also opens with a glimpse of part one's final confrontation and has a few kills reminiscent of past ""Friday the 13th""  films. But is this Jason the same guy we have grown to know and love? Well, not exactly.

The film opens many years before when an enraged mother is trying to kill the last of the irresponsible camp counselors who allowed her son to drown. The last counselor turns the tables on the angry mother and escapes. Now after so many years, we see a glimpse of an abandoned Camp Crystal Lake and a group of sex-crazed/pot starved campers get massacred by a masked man. Fast forward 6 weeks later, a young man named Clay (Jared Padalecki, Supernatural) is searching for his missing sister who was part of the murdered group of campers. Oops, there is now another group of horny campers who will be staying in the cabin of rich boy Trent (Travis Van Winkle) and of course, Clay befriends the rich boy's girlfriend Jenna (Danielle Panabaker). Well, the new group is now in Jason's hit list as he kills them off one by one. It's up to the campers to delay their escapades so they can survive.

The screenplay by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift (also wrote the fun ""Freddy vs. Jason"") takes some elements from the first four films and adds a little bit of their own ideas. The film won't be a classic and truth be told, it won't be one of the best horror films I've seen this year; but the film does have good production values, serves up some ominous atmosphere and some pretty good kill scenes. Let's give credit where credit is due: it's not as bad as the worst films of the Friday franchise. If we'll be passing judgment from a modern horror standpoint, this film isn't really that good, it offers nothing unique or different, and suspense is almost none-existent. Fortunately, there can be fun to be had in its viewing experience. I'm not defending the film as I will point out its many flaws.

Granted the ""Friday"" films weren't really that imaginative when it comes to plot and they have stereotypical characters. This latest installment has the same formulas, but the problems with the characters isn't so much as being clichd but it is the execution that they were written. Trent is just one boring, annoying character that hampers the film. Travis Van Winkle did the best he could and the script definitely wanted the viewer to wish him dead--but anyone with such dumb lines as ""stupendous"" or ""my house, my rules"" sounds more like an adult policing kids than an arrogant teen. Then there's your usual stereotypical kids like Chewie and Lawrence (played by Aaron Yoo and Arlen Escarpeta respectively) who likes getting stoned and drunk; the film overstays its welcome of pot jokes. There's also a loser who supposedly had sex with a mannequin. Ok, we get it already--the viewer is supposed to wish these dudes to die a horrible death but it doesn't mean the viewer has to die along with them. Bree (sexy Julianna Guille) plays your usual dumb sex object but boy, does she look good in her birthday suit. Oh, the film does toss about the fair share of sex and nudity, for this I am thankful. I guess the film dawdles too much on attempts at humor and I don't know, but I thought the first group of campers were a little more interesting. Danielle Panabaker's Jenna is arguably the film's most likable character and Clay may be the one to generate some sympathy for his search for his sister. I have very mixed feelings for Amanda Righetti's Whitney, I thought her character was more meant for a minor plot device, and I did not like the way she played her perfunctory final scene.

As for our hockey-masked killer, Jason. Well, this dude is a very different Jason from what we were used to. A friend of mine said that ""Jason wouldn't do that.."" and I agree with him. This Jason is a re-imagining, the director obviously meant him to be smarter (he makes trip wires, traps, and using a victim as bait), he runs and has great talent for killing his prey quickly. I guess director Marcus Nispel wanted to avoid the clichd elements of a slasher flick, but he also loses an important element; the older Jason created by Victor Miller may occasionally run in the earlier films, but he does not take hostages, or make traps--and he is one intimidating creepy killer with his single-mindedness. The fact that he doesn't run too much in later films gives the viewer the idea that the victim may get away, and the fact that Jason just catches up and comes out of nowhere is one of the Friday franchise's aces--Jason was scary like that. Derek Mears does look intimidating, and that rooftop shot can become a part of Jason's best ICONIC photo-ops. However, this Jason feels little too ordinary, and he loses some of the aspects that garnered him a cult following. The kill scenes are good but not that inventive either. Some scenes do carry hints to past ""Friday"" films and may be seen as homages; the campfire ghost story, the change to the hockey facemask, the arrow shot from Part 3, shadows behind the tent (was it part 4?), the sleeping bag kill (New Blood or was it Jason X?), the exploration of the former camp grounds (part 2?). These scenes can give one a few trips to nostalgia lane, although realistically speaking, this camp shouldn't even exist anymore.

Also, the film was obviously meant to be bloody but the cinematography is a little too dark at times, that no matter how good a kill scene would be, it doesn't really matter when you can barely see it. But hey, gore is gore right? Ok, this Dvd's ""killer cut"" may have some more blood and based on what I've read, this version is 9 minutes longer. Containing more gruesome, bloody and extended death scenes and undoubtedly more nudity. There are some changes to some scenes as with Whitney discovering a trapped Richie, a tub shot and Chelsea's discovery. There are probably more inserts but I can't really be certain since I didn't see this movie in theaters, I waited for the film's R-Rated cut.

Overall, ""Friday the 13th"" isn't a dismal failure. It is a lot better than the worst sequels of the franchise but if you look at it from a horror fan standpoint, it really isn't that good. It lacked the necessary scares and thrills that would make a horror film succeed, but the film is a lot of fun as it does go back to the series` straight face. The ineptly written characters do threaten to ruin the film, and the film doesn't practice a good sense of restraint. Still, this new ""Friday"" installment is a fun experience, and given the added scenes, this ""Killer Cut"" may have made the film a lot better.

236610,2,6300214087,"I love JASON  movies, so I hope they keep making these things, but this is a pretty poor attempt. The dialogue is absolutely terrible, script is poor, direction is lame, acting serviceable to irritating, kills are dull, cinematography sucks, etc...but I love watching Jason running around and slashing people, so it is enjoyable despite itself. These things are like James Bond movies, listen to the fans and throw in a new wrinkle or two and everyone leaves the theater happy. I really enjoyed FREDDY VS. JASON, so why is this one so stupid? Also, please banish implants from all future horror films! Enough is enough. The romp in the bedroom is a lot of fun, but the girl in the campfire scene shoulda kept her top on.

The film itself has a rather big budget for this genre and it really is a bit off-putting at first. Having grown up on these low-budget 80s slashers, its disconcerting when you see a little more money thrown at them. Sort of takes you out of the genre entirely. We're use to seeing our cast and locations more cut-rate - except for the colors. The old FRIDAYS all seemed to have that bright technicolor look to them and nowadays the tendency is toward more natural hues. This makes the proceedings seem a bit less lurid in our opinion. At least they resisted the temptation to use those horrible sepia-like filters that they usually do in these modern re-imaginings. (Hmmmmmm . . . re-imagining is definetly not the word for this movie. It's really just more of the same ol' formula lifted verbatim from the old Paramount days. But in this case, that's a good thing.)

The timing is adequate, the gore is right up there and there's even a surprising amount of gratuitous nudity - just like the good old days. Our only problem? It just was not that frightening. This is probably more our fault than the cast and crew of the movie because we haven't found any of these things truly terrifying since 1978s original HALLOWEEN. But, it is entertaining -- especially if you enjoy watching pretty (but really stupid) 20-somethings being ""thinned-out"" from the herd. And Mr. Voorhees actually runs after his victims in this one - as opposed to simply teleporting from location to location. (Those of you familiar with the original films will know exactly what we mean.)

Certainly worth a look.",1245283200,2,1820,4.663551401869159
236612,5,6300214087,"Here's the deal.  I've been a fan of Friday the 13th movies since I was a kid in the '80s.  Watched 'em all.  Loved most (hated goes to Hell and Jason X).  This DVD is bare bones, and hopefully a fuller one will be released (as happened with the Texas Chainsaw remake a few years back).  The short documentary about bringing Jason back is sort of interesting, but could have been fleshed out more.

This latest version IS a Jason movie regardless of what others (mostly whiners who don't have their facts straight, or a real appreciation for the series) have to say.  It's essentially a combination of parts 2-4 as you've probably already heard. Rewatching those movies, it's tough to say any of them were ""good"" but they were entertaining.  And so is this one!  Look for homages to Tom Savini (e.g. machete to head), ""Blue Velvet"" (Heiniken?!) and other great icons.  Fun stuff if you know anything at ALL about cult movies and horror...

Here's the top 10 misunderstandings I've seen thrown around relating to this flick, and WHY they're wrong:

1) Jason runs and is smart.  Watch the original movies 2-4 to see this.  He runs, he jumps, he lunges with agility.  He thinks, he plans, he psyches victims out. Same in this version.  People who claim this is a new characteristic truly don't know squat about the originals.

2) Jason lives in a shelter.  In this movie it was an abandoned mine (not tunnels he dug as others have wrongly claimed). In 2 it was a shed he had crudely slapped together.  In 3 and 4, who knows? he was out wandering the whole time.

3) The victims are truly HORRIBLE people who, let's face it, you'd like to slice and dice too.  Jason saves you the trouble.  Sometimes he's quick, efficient, and just wants to dispatch the person.  Other times he's a bit more creative.  He's got his moods...all shades of rage and hate.

4) The pot grows wild.  WILD, people.  It's NOT Jason's crop.  He's just in the neighborhood.  Enough with the ""Jason's a pot farmer"" nonesense.

5) The kills and story line in this movie are as good, or in some cases better (THAT'S RIGHT, I said BETTER) than in Parts 2-4. No fishing line is visible when he shoots an arrow through a head (unlike the spear in Pt 3).  The impalement on the back of the truck was cool.  So was the dock action. The story makes sense (as much as needed in a film like this).

6) Jason is not an unstoppable zombie. That only came about after Pt. 5 failed to spark interest.  It was a lame attempt to keep cashing in on the franchise (even though the movies WERE cool in their own way).  In parts 2-4, Jason is just a huge, strong, angry, hydrocephalic misanthrope.  Same as in this movie.

7) Jason isn't the focus of ANY Friday movie.  He's always got minimal screen time (show up, kill, disappear).  The victims necessarily are the focus.  The TALK and do things.  Jason doesn't talk.  He doesn't do much.  In fact, in this movie, we see him doing more than in ANY previous venue.  He sharpens his machete.  He kicks around some wash tubs in a fit of rage. He...well...he kills a bunch of bratty yuppies.  What more do we need to see him doing?  Lounging on a sofa? Sitting on the john?

8) The ""ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma"" theme isn't used much here.  True.  SO?! Sure it would have been nice to hear it a few more times, but honestly, if you're sitting around paying attention to sound effects, that means the movie ain't so happening.  I didn't even notice it wasn't part of the film 'til after the movie was over.  I believe it would have been a cliche and detracted from the film anyway.  So there!

9)The ending was ""off.""  Everybody's been bitching about how unlikely it would be to drop a psycho killer's body into a lake after surviving all those events.  DIDN'T YOU NOTICE HOW ODDLY DEEP THE WATER WAS UNDER THE DOCK?  Say...duh...do you suppose the ending was a...I dunno...a DREAM?! Like in the first one?  Oh, right, audiences need every sinlge little thing spelled out for them these days.  Ambiguity?! WHAT'S THAT?!  I'm perfectly happy accepting the dock ending as a dream sequence, based on the similarity to the end of part 1.  Use your IMAGINATION (if you have one).

10) Finally, I'd like to point out that NOWHERE at ANY time in the past was it EVER stated that Jason was retarded (or developmentally disabled to the p.c. crowd).  His mom said he was...well...he needed looking after.  He was clearly deformed physically, but no one ever claimed he was anything but a boy (or man) of normal intelligence.  A bit uncultured, yes, but smart and diabolical nevertheless.

This movie is definitely the best one of the series since Parts 2 & 4 (my personal favorites).  If you're a fan, you'll like it.  If you're a gimpy loser who THINKS you like Friday movies, just go watch Saw and get another piercing becuse you're a loser and no one likes you.",1245283200,2,4839,4.510392609699769
236613,1,6300214087,"Jason runs? What a gyp. Jason is supposed to be a slow and plodding zombie. He's very slow yet he somehow manages to beat you to where you're running. How he does, we don't know. But Jason running? Please.

Jason thinks? That's right, he has traps set in place.

Jason takes prisoners? That's right, he's smart enough to set traps yet is dumb enough to mistake a teenage girl for his mother.

Did I also mention that Jason Runs?

This film was just plain terrible. This is a compilation of films 1-4, and a terrible one.

236656,2,6300214087,"This movie is not very good at all. All the things that made the first eight Fridays so special are gone and glossed over in an attempt to bring Jason back to basic. The director and producers stated their intentions  were to bring Jason to a new generation, but they failed. This is what happens when Hollywood takes an iconic character they don't really understand or respect. Jason's roots began in independent films...it was a mistake to turn him into this dumb mainstream Hollywood character.

Unlike the previous Fridays, I didn't care for any of the actors (victims) in this movie. They don't even look like average teens... they look like the average rich and plastic models you see in the magazines. Another thing that annoyed me is all the characters were one dimensional in their personalities (they seemed alike). In every past Friday, you always had at least one character you could indentify with...not this time because they were all the same. Another mistake is the acting...it  is horrible. Granted you don't expect academy award winning performances in this series but I expected the actors to provide more thrills than this. They did not...they were boring.

One star for the producers and their ATTEMPTS to bring Jason back to basic and another star for Parmount for giving Jason the treatment he deserves (I am happy and surprise by all the wonderful re-releases of the original Fridays). BUT unless the producers and Parmount understand why Jason became an icon, I believe they will continue to fail with remakes  such as this and eventually result in the demise of Jason.",1245196800,,1594,4.910780669144981

I didn't get scared at all. I like the remake of such old gems like HALLOWEEN, DAWN OF THE DEAD, and even TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. This can't come close.
I was really hoping for Jason to be more in the background, to build up the suspense, but instead we get lame sex scenes and Jason running all over the place like he's a damn realestate agent.
I liked a couple of the characters in this flick, more than in previous Fridays, but it was just lacking creepiness. Not worth buying, almost not worth renting....sorry folks, this lacks the scare factor.",1245196800,,708,4.5390625
236659,3,6300214087,"It had a lot of jumps, sure, but I wouldn't say that this was the best movie out of the series. The cast kept promising that this movie was going to be more mature and not as corny, but it turned out to be no different from the original movie series. True, you have to have some of the old cliches or it wouldn't be Friday the 13th, but it also makes it unoriginal. I am a long time fan of this franchise and I can tell you that this wasn't the best, but luckily also wasn't the worst.

One thing that bothered me in the movie was how Jason would be in the yard and then be on the roof of the cabin a second later. It works for zombie Jason since he has supernatural powers, or that you can believe, but this Jason is supposed to be alive! There is no way that he could pop out of all of these different places unles he had some portal I didn't know about and never show. Another thing is that Jason can take a hit with a sledge hammer better than he can take a kick in the face. It's kind of funny that he snaps hammers in half by blocking, but is slowed down when the main female character of the movie kicks him.

What I did like about the movie was the few minutes at the beginning of the film with Nana Visitor as Pamela Voorhees. She was incredible with the few minutes she was on and did a fantastic Betsy Palmer voice. I almost felt that she deserved her own movie more than this movie. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. It was  nice to see Jason return to Crystal Lake because this is where he belongs. Friday the 13th (2009) is the best movie since Part VII, but I was just disappointed it wasn't anymore original since this was a reboot.

Horny, rambunctious kids just can't stay away from Camp Crystal Lake.  They never got the memo in the 80s, and apparently not here in 2009.  Just like you've seen before (in eight other films remember?) these kids were stabbed, slashed, impaled, and so on and so forth.

Every ""Friday the 13th"" film has been indistinguishable from the last.  So then what's new with the `09 remake?  Other than a modern look, not much.

236664,5,6300214087,"First and foremost, I am a fan.  I have been addicted to Friday the 13th since I was young.  With that being said, the newest edition of Friday the 13th (2009) is a superb addition to the franchise that should satisfy all the rabid hardcore fans, but also, casual horror fans alike.  The biggest innovation in this film is the effort to ""humanize"" Jason.  This is done through a clever twist that details Jason's complex underground labyrinth beneath Crystal Lake.  What this adds, is an unseen element that *explains* how Jason is able to quickly traverse the terrain, but also, how he lives during his periods of dormancy.  The detail of the Crystal Lake sets are amazing.  However, like most Friday the 13th films, there is a level of profound juvenile ignorance that is seen through the group of kids.  The solution to this?  IGNORE THEM, they won't be alive that long anyways!  Finally, the actor portrayal of Jason in this film is a much needed rejuvenation of the character.  Personally, I felt Kane Hodder's (Pt 7-10) personification of the character was horrible.  He turned Jason into a zombie-esque figure that was more comical than menacing.  Enjoy the movie!",1245110400,,1171,4.824120603015075
236665,3,6300214087,"Horror movie icons have been known to reappear since the original master of monsters came up with THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. You can't keep a good creature down. When the FRIDAY THE 13TH series panned out after Jason went to New York, outer space and to take on Freddy Kreuger, fans thought it was over. Not so with the release this year of a remake, a reinvention of sorts, of Jason Voorhees.

The beginning of this film take us through much of what we experienced in the original first two films with Jason's mother blaming camp counselors for ignoring her child and then killing them off. Except this time young Jason is watching as his mother is beheaded rather than the original series where Jason suddenly came back from the supposed dead.

Fast forward to the present and a group of young adults (trust me, these aren't teens) as they trek through the woods in search of a secret marijuana field. Of course it has to be located near Camp Crystal Lake and one of the group tells the tale of young Jason and his mother. A few naked women, some low key sex and moments later Jason is in full force killing all in sight.  With his attack on the lone remaining victim, the titles finally creep on to the screen.

Six weeks later as a new group of college students hit the area. Trent is a young snob whose parents own a cottage nearby and the group is headed there. When they stop at a local gas station they run into a young man named Clay (Jared Padalecki) who is questioning the attendant whether he has seen a young woman (the last victim earlier). It turns out this is his sister and he's continued looking for her even though the police have given up.

After leaving, Clay continues to check with the locals' door to long distant door to see if anyone has seen his sister. Instead he gets odd responses ranging from a warning from and elderly woman to an offer for some weed by a local goofball.

The other group, the students, arrive at the cottage and begin what all college kids do: get stoned and run around naked! Okay maybe not, but in movies that's what they do. Then Clay turns up at their door, the next one down the road. A near confrontation with Trent leads to Trent's girlfriend Jenna (Danielle Panabaker) going for a walk with Clay.

As Clay and Jenna search for Clay's sister, we discover that she's been taken captive by Jason and kept in a tunnel near the camp. Jenna becomes the first victim of Jason to become prisoner as opposed to a number on the film death toll!

Night falls and Jason begins to knock up the body count. First, the local goofball and then on to the college students. Of course any of them that choose to get stoned or have sex become immediate victims. The rest fall down the line but their time is coming.

A final confrontation between Jason and Clay is a given as well as the possible escape of Clay's sister. But before that can happen the victims pile up in definitely different ways. After all, the core fans of this series are less interested in the lifestyles of the rich and famous and more into the various modes of murder Jason will employ.

Oddly enough, I felt this version of the Voorhees story was toned down from the original film that was released in 1980. Can it really have been 29 years ago? The first film was a landmark in on screen gore for a mainstream film, offering some amazing effects by the master of gore, Tom Savini. This film takes a more subtle approach and actually loses a bit in the process with less blood spilled.

I'm not a fan of the new wave of what is called torture porn in films like HOSTEL. But I do realize that the gore quota in a horror film these days must be high enough to satisfy fans of the genre. Unfortunately that's where this film falls short. Word is that a sequel is in the works and the writers have been ordered to come up with more creative ways to die. An odd thing to type in a review and an even odder concept to think of when we talk about a world obsessed with violence.

On the whole the film does do a good job of not just rehashing the same old thing but instead twisting it enough to make it its own film. The actors do a great job, especially Derek Mears as Jason, a role that most fans thought could only belong to Kane Hodder who took on the role in part 7 and ran with it through part 10. Mears makes for a faster, more deadly pursuer which to me is scarier than the lumbering beast he had become.

Fear fans will flock to this film and it will be hard to find on the shelf the first week out. This gives you all time to watch the older ones until you come across it. In any event, the film should make for a night of chills, thrills and blood spills that will entertain horror fans for at least one evening and perhaps into your nightmares as well.",1245110400,3,4771,4.299554565701559

236699,5,6300214087,"this review is for the Friday the 13th KILLER CUT special edition (running time: 106 minutes; still technically rated R, not UNRATED). this cut is a bit different from the theatrical, but not enough to change what you already think about the movie (e.g. the Director's Cut of Rob Zombie's Halloween, which ruined the movie). There are mostly small additions, like extra dialog & slightly extended kills (like the ""sleeping bag"" & Trent's kill is more brutal). After the show down, with the wood-chipper, we get a quick sequence of some of the locations. the big changes are: the opening, with Pam Voorhees' beheading, we see little Jason's face; Jason has a flashback of his mother's death, while sharpening his machete; Whitney actually escapes from Jason's underground tunnels & the sex scene with Bree & Trent is much longer. i like the theatrical cut better, but something tells me that i will grow to love this KILLER CUT even more, over time.

Special Features:

a short behind-the-scenes featurette, talking to the cast & crew.

I am really a nice, sweet, fun-loving guy who likes to commune with nature, running through the woods, singing to the birds, chasing butterflies and frollicking with the deer.  Sure I've sliced and diced, hacked and maimed, slashed and speared and disemboweled my share of over-sexed teen and teen-ettes, but if a camper full of horny teenagers pulled up to your neck of the woods with their loud music, heavy breathing, moaning and groaning and rocking camper...wouldn't you?  I always remember my mother Pamela Vorhees always read to me from the good book, ""Do Unto Others..but at the point of a sharp blade""..or something like that. It was always hard to tell with Mother....she was a little crazy. Anyhoo I think I hear a van full of randy teens coming from over yonder--let me sharpen my machete-put on my hockey mask and wander on over and have a look-see.  I'll get back to you folks later. Oh!  Before I forget.  Kids! Practice safe sex.  Always wear a condom.  Peace.

Thank you Jason for your input..now for the review.  Jason directed this vanity production of his greatest hits and he kept his promise to pay a visit to those pesky teenagers and any noise and screaming you heard he cut off pretty quick. Bloody and gory, Jason is a bit on the messy side but he is efficient. If you like Fridays, and who doesn't and Jason now is the time to hook-up with an old fiend.  Oh, what's that noise? Someone is opening my window. He's wearing a hockey mask and has a bloody machete in his hand.  He is climbing in and ..and.....

236701,2,6300214087,"The slew of mindless remakes keep coming from originality-bankrupt Hollywood, but this time, we're entreated to a remake not of the 80s slasher classic, but rather, an A&F commercial with it's golden summer camp light, clean, young, blond well-cut boys, and able-bodied young blond girls, forever young, forever rich, forever inaccessible.  Throw in two Aeropostle minorities and some Old Navy guy on a beat up motorcycle looking for his missing sister, and basically, you have a microcosm of the current multinational trade relations, cleverly hidden within a teen horror flick.

I can't imagine anyone watching a Friday 13th to be involved in anything but light-hearted fun, cheap scares, and R-rated titillation.  What made me laugh out loud was the decision to travel down the road most traveled.  You'd think the scary hockey mask dude won't pop out at the moment he's most likely to: he does.  That the Asian man won't get the girl again: he doesn't.  The black man doesn't make it to the end: he doesn't.  The final jump out scare before the credits roll: it happens.

The script is really all the humor in this film.  When the Aeropostle twins beat the A&F duo at beer pong, and the losers have to chug the penalty from the opponent's filthy shoes, the white alpha male says, ""this is my house, we play by my rules.""  Not only does the ""winner"" consent, he goes on to drink from his own filthy shoes.  China, are you paying attention?!: this is cultural imperialism at it's most instructive.  The black man is relegated to be around, talk about rap, and do drugs.  But he never really has access to anything, except a fashion catalog during hard times.  Much like the original, everyone is segregated to a slot mainstream viewers can feel comfortable with.  Even at the most heightened state of emergency, the blond girl screams ""somebody do something! I can't take it anymore!""  It's still about her.

So like everything else in life, it's the brunettes who have to come in once again to save the day.  Danielle Panabaker looks heroine-worthy pretty, like Alexis Bledel, Amber Tamblyn, and Famke Janssen thrown in a blender.  She teams up with Old Navy, and they try to stay alive as long as possible.  Jason's inhuman strength, ability to live alone with a stuff animal intact bedside, people's wound spots mysteriously disappearing...all that I can accept.  But how the heck does this girl keep her hair so FANTABULOUS while running through a rain soaked forest, piles of decomposing body, rotting underground tunnels, and the ever present grabby hands?

My only other problem is the surprise timing: I was able to lift up my hands exactly 1 second before each death happens.  So in a sense, this is more a spoof (not as witty as Cabin Fever) than an actual horror film.  Compared to the 80s version, I'd have to say the only difference is that teens are more hormonally charged in the former, and they had sex on their minds more often (must be TAB soda), while the modern day kids seem to be way too concerned with material possessions.  Although the sterling lines ""You got optimal nipple placement, dude"" is probably going to be the new sexiest compliment every girl yearns to hear during lovemaking.

I'm not really big on Part 1 cause Jason is not even in it, till the end of course. But I still like the film as a horror movie and Betsy Palmer at the end, ""Kill Her Mommy"", was just plain creepy. I can't really get into the series until Part 3, when Jason seems to start developing this super human strength. Part 7 is my all time favorite, Kane Hodder was vicious and the make-up was incredible. Everything after 7 is just ok. That being said, the re-make really got me excited. I think maybe the intro with Mrs. Voorhees could have been a few minutes longer, but no big deal. Jason seemed like he was a mix between 3 & 4. He was running and he just seemed to have this unbelievable strength, which is what I want out of a Jason flick. I say ""Jason Flick"" cause I really don't consider any of the old movies to be Friday the 13th movies except the original Betsy Palmer movie. Everything else was a Jason movie. Like the documentary that was released not too long ago, I think the new 2009 movie should have been called ""His Name Was Jason"". I believe anyone knowing what the series is about and is a fan of slasher movies, would simply love this movie. I'm glad they didn't stray away from the original Jason premise. I wanna keep seeing more sequels on Crystal Lake with Jason butchering the hell out of everyone and I would prefer to see him evolve into a zombie type figure and get Kane Hodder back behind the mask.

Somehow, the team that so likes to remake classic and semi-classic horror films from way back, managed to butcher a remake of the first three ""Friday the 13ths"". A seemingly impossible task, but Michael Bay and Marcus Nispel pulled it off.

Contrary to the opinion of  many horror film fans and critics, the first two installments of ""Friday the 13th"" were not bad movies, mainly because they cribbed the atmosphere and even some of the murder set pieces from Mario Bava's body count movie, ""Twitch of the Death Nerve"".

Even the score was an imitation of the classic score from ""Psycho"" and the iconic  ""chhh chhh, haaa, haaa"" was borrowed from the end of an old Pink Floyd song called, appropriately enough, ""Careful With That Ax, Eugene"" (please don't reply  telling me it's ""kill kill ma ma"". Manfredini has been claiming that lately, but there's an old Fangoria interview where he mentions the Pink Floyd song as the inspiration.)

That being said, the first two movies were serious, well done, and scary (my favorite scene in the first one is the girl in the bathroom after Marcia was killed. The killer is still there hiding behind the shower curtain and you see that hand pulling it back - creepy stuff), and Manfredini's score gave them tremendous atmosphere. As the series progressed, the films got worse, and aside from the occasional success like ""Jason Lives"" - one of the first slasher parodies that predated ""Scream"" by over 10 years, and hit-or-miss experiments like ""Jason goes to Hell"" and ""Jason X"", most of the sequels were as bad as this new remake.

The remake starts off with a misfire - instead of the first 15 minutes recapping the original murders with Mrs. Voorhees, they have Jason as the killer with the cloth mask and only mention the Mrs. Voorhees storyline in the first 2 minutes. They could have easily had the first 15 minutes showing an unseen killer who was revealed as Mrs. Voorhees, and it probably would have thrown some people off, and worked well.

The Bay/Nispel theme of slasher films as a morality tale to warn against the evils of pot smoking is here, as it was with their remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and the fact that almost every character is depicted as a clueless weed obsessed dolt gets annoying after awhile. Compare the characters in the first two movies with the exaggerated moronic stereotypes in this remake and you'll see the differences immediately.

And the gore scenes that practically define a ""Friday the 13th"" film are bad - one murder even suggests that the person was killed by having their ear cut off - lame. There is a moment where Jason throws an ax that is well done, and another kill that recalls the original series, but a few minutes cannot save this mess.

While the original has a classic jump-scare ending (inspired by ""Carrie""), the ending to this movie is similar to some of the terrible sequels.

And the music. This film has none of Manfredini's strings and only uses the ""Chhh chhh haaa haaa"" theme a few times, once, strangely enough, when a police officer is approaching a cabin - this actually had me thinking they were going the ""Chainsaw"" remake route with a police officer helping Jason, but it was just an inept,  misplaced music cue.

Some individuals will love this (""it has Jason killing, dude, awesome!""), while others who are more discriminating will smell it for the garbage that it is.",1243296000,3,3587,4.727564102564102
236734,1,6300214087,"It's a shame Jason couldn't kill Marcus Nispel and Michael Bay before they released this insulting fraud. While this beloved horror series has had a couple bumps in the road before now (part 5 and JASON GOES TO HELL) the series has never before sunk as low as this disaster. Since this film made a ton of money at the theatre (I plunked down my 10 bucks as well) it will certainly get worse now that Platinum Dunes has the rights to disembowel this franchise. What's next? Probably FRIDAY THE 13th: THE BEGINNING.

The most grevious mistake the film makes is changing the nature of Jason Vorhees. Jason now has an elaborate underground lair, tortures his victims before killing them, and takes hostages. He even has a sentimental side. This film couldn't have gone more wrong with the Jason character if the producers had hired Miley Cyrus to play Jason in a musical version.

Although Nispel loves to call this film a ""re-imagining"" or ""reboot"" there is no imagination evident anywhere in this cinematic crapfest. The ending of the film is so obvious and expected that I was not in the least surprised to hear cries of ""boo"" from the audience in the theatre. After Jason almost gets backed into some machinery he is stabbed, thrown into the lake and then jumps out (duh!) and takes down the survivors back into the lake with him. THE END How original. How imaginative. How did they ever think of that?

This is also an extrordinarily UGLY looking film. It looks as if it was shot on standard definition video and then transfered to film (badly). While previous FRIDAY films may not have been Stanley Kubrick quality, they did have some beautiful shots and camera work. Apparently Platinum Dunes hires only blind cinematographers as there is not a single decent looking shot in the entire picture.

How about the gore and nudity? It's there, but it is all routine and boring and never really has any impact whatsoever.

I'm not one to fuss about remakes. I thought Rob Zombie did an acceptable job with HALLOWEEN. MY BLOODY VALENTINE was lots of fun. There is nothing wrong with doing a remake but for God's sake lets all stop going to anything with Michael Bay's name on it. Same goes for Marcus Nispel. That untalented idiotic hack couldn't direct snot out of his own nose. These people know nothing about good film making. After THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake and now this entertainment free, revolting, vile, wretched, pathetic, fraudulent waste of time and money called FRIDAY THE 13th, I know enough to never watch one of their films again.

Also they didn't do anything to drastic (Like sending him to Manhattan or Space).They did change Jason a little he seems faster stronger and he seems a little more territorial (we also don't have to wait for two more films to come out to see him in  his hockey mask).  But at the same time of not doing anything to drastic the film it's self in a lot of ways is too similar to the original. Some might like that but majority won't (even some of the cast die in similar was). So you can probably consider this more of an updated version of the film.,1243036800,,877,4.0813953488372094
236776,3,6300214087,"I personally enjoyed the original Friday the 13th that somewhat set off a trend of teenage slasher movies..it was something new at that time. However now we have countless such slasher movies with just more inovative ways to kill a person..add to it some more nudity & camera angles..the fear & suspence element is missing.
we have seen remakes of our favourite horrors like; Halloween, Omen, Friday the 13th etc..when will some really good film maker/studio attempt to remake the best of them all..THE EXORCIST?!",1242604800,,513,5.047058823529412
236777,3,6300214087,"I was wise enough to not get my hopes up. The Friday the 13th films have always fluctuated in quality, but aside from Part V they have always delivered the goods in either meagre or generous amounts.

Platinum Dunes' restart is utterly determined to gives us the best Jason possible, and it's evident that they tried their best. But the collective best of Michael Bay, Marcus Nispel, Damian Shannon, Mark Swift, and composer Steve Jablonsky (music has always played an important part of this franchise) just isn't good enough.

The characters are flat, boring, and lifeless cardboards cut-outs. A mistake that most slasher films make is giving us horrible, nasty characters that we WANT to see killed (turning the killer into a sort of anti-hero in the process) rather than characters we like. There is no excitement or horror in counting down the minutes until the stock jerk boyfriend gets eviscerated. There is also a shocking dearth of common sense or logic to their actions. I understand that the extended version of the film may fill in some blanks and fill out their reasoning somewhat, but I still cannot side with characters who make stupid, stupid decisions and just don't use their head.

I appreciate the fact that they shot the film in anamorphic Panavision (something that is sadly dying out a world of cheap, ugly Super35) but the high key, polished, and shiny photography doesn't seem to fit. Take a look at Part IV. It wasn't the best entry in the series, but the grainy as hell photography created an undeniably bleak, depressing atmosphere and gave the film a unique kind of intensity that is missing here.

Jablonsky's score is nothing more than the same noise he gave us with every single one of his previous movies. If the man has any kind of musical talent he's yet to convince me of it. Yes, it works, but only on an extremely basic level. But blasting us with a sudden storm of noise as Jason appears on screen is a dated 'stinger' scare and is void of sophistication. I know that complexity is not something one should be looking for in a Jason movie, but Harry Manfredini's Herrmann-esquire scores for parts I-VI were far superior.

The actors do their best with the weak script, so I can't really fault them. The low body count also disappoints. Was it really necessary to specifically give us thirteen kills? It doesn't give the film any kind of clever or ironic edge, if anything it just saves on the blood and gore effects.

Since 1980 we've had twelve Jason movies (counting his brief appearance in the first), so did we really need yet ANOTHER slow, stalk and slash entry set at Camp Crystal Lake? Jason has been to New York, Hell, and outer space. Why, oh why, go back to the same old, same old? This film should have given us something new, but did absolutely did not. Why don't people from the town realize that so many victims are splattered right on their doorstep? How did little Jason come to fend for himself in the woods? Is he EVER going to go on a gung-ho rampage through the streets? Hiding in the trees while the music whispers CH CH CH AH AH AH is old, old, old, and I am sick and tired of it.

Apparently Shannon and Swift are working on the script for the sequel as we speak. Get it right this time, guys. There's a reason why this film sank like brick after it's first week. You promised something new but gave us something embarrassingly ancient. The audience stayed away once word of mouth got around that you took advantage of their trusting nature.

Having said all that, I will always invest my time in watching Jason carve 'em up. He deserves a lot better though.

BTW, it's not really a reboot. The film still acknowledges the events of the 1980 original while tweaking the continuity a little bit (the Friday the 13th films were never really solid with the timeline anyway). Think of it as just another Jason adventure. Calling it Part XII would have alienated potential viewers, but the simple Friday the 13th doesn't necessarily mean it's a straight-up remake.",1242518400,2,4020,4.634831460674158
236778,5,6300214087,"To say that I am an avid fan of horror movies would be an understatement. For me its close to an obsession. I have been watching everything from Night of the Living Dead (B&W original) to Puppetmaster to Evil Dead and so on and so forth since I was a young kid. I saw Childs Play when I was about 5 years old and have been hooked ever since. Horror movies now days seem to think that cheap special effects, lack of blood, and no death scene are the way to go in order to acheive that PG - 13 rating for some odd reason. I mean WTF!?!?!?! Im not a child and I don't enjoy someone claiming a movie is scary when it is only rated PG-13. I don't care who you are......If a ""scary"" movie is rated PG-13 IT SUCKS!!

Now onto the new Friday the 13th produced by Michael Bay. This movie is EXACTLY how all horror movies should be. There is almost no storyline involved. This is a good old fashioned kill everyone type of movie. I believe there is a death scene at least every 10 minutes and each one is creative and bloody in true FT13 style. I mean if you do not like this movie for ANY reason then you just have no business watching horror movies. Stick with the Disney channel where you belong and leave the adults to the good stuff!!

Bottom line........if you are a fan of blood and guts type of horror....BUY THIS MOVIE! It will not dissapoint at all. Cross my heart and hope to die.......by a machete!",1242345600,6,1400,4.181481481481481
236779,3,6300214087,"I had the honor of seeing this in the theater. I also had the pleasure of seeing the original Friday the 13th at a young 8 years old back in 1980 in the theater as well.  The sequels were fun when they came out, we'd all flock to the cinema over the years and soak in the slasher films as they were released.

This ""remake"" should've been the one and only sequel.  I remember some many years ago, Mad Magazine published a cartoon of Rocky Balboa, and was of an elderly man in boxing gear: ROCKY XX...basically poking fun at all these movies in the 80's that had continuous sequels (whattya know--Rocky came out one more time a few years back--although Stallone wasn't white haired!).

My point is this--our new character of Jason basically sets out to accomplish everything by the end of the movie that it took all of the years and sequels to do in the 80's. What Hollywood should've done was re-release the original (which they did, many many times) on one of the anniversaries--but IN THE THEATER.  Cleaned up, like they offered in the dvd re-issue.  Then, the hype would've been generated to the point where this ""remake"" could've come out as ""FRIDAY THE 13th: Jason's Payback"" or ""Retribution"" or something to that extent.

But a good film with great fx.  Def a must have for your dvd collection.",1242172800,,1300,4.549356223175966
236780,2,6300214087,"When I saw the trailer last year for this movie I was amazed and couldn't wait for the movie to come out. Everything I saw was building my hopes up...The Jason running faster was a plus and I was thinking this was going to bring the series to a new level just as the running zombies in recent movies up'd the bar scale in recent zombie movies. I had heard Kane's POV stating Jason does NOt need to run. He is by far in my own personal opinion the best actor at playing Jason, I disagreed and doubted his opinion once I saw the new trailer...But I was wrong and he was right. Jason came out looking like a guy in a mask killing poeple. A thinner and taller version of the Leatherface of recent. Kane Hodder was perfect because although he is much shorter his body build is much more threatening than a skinny Jason. The mask on him looked too big for his face. I thought that by making him run faster, it would create a more helpless atmosphere but instead it gave him human like features and took away the essence of Jason. Jason was human at one point but after being killed so many times he has turned into an essence of evil...this movie took that away.

Friday the 13th series are slasher movies with much sex and nudity in it. They should of focused more on giving it a better script rather than fall back into the ""more sex"" is better mentality.

If they want to revive the series bring in a foreign director. The french have been doing great in the horror movie genre and as cliched as it may sound bring back Kane",1241740800,,1521,4.241379310344827
236781,3,6300214087,"I saw this remake, that takes elements from the first four Friday the 13th films, the day it opened. While the older installments are not great by any means, some were pretty entertaining to me (Parts 1, 2, 4 and 6 come to mind).

You have all your classic slasher stuff here. A great iconic killer, numerous kills (13 in total), nudity from three hot chicks and not much plot. The acting isn't too bad for the most part and there are even some humerous moments thrown into the mix. Most of the kills were good, but nothing as unique or gory as I was hoping for. There are some homages here and there from past flicks and it was cool seeing Jason go from potato sack over his head to the legendary hockey mask. The famous ""ki ki ki, ma ma ma"" music theme was nice to hear again, but it wasn't used nearly enough. This is no masterpiece by a long shot, but out of all the remakes the studios are pumping out these days it's one of the better ones.

Friday the 13th does nothing new and those who expect more are watching the wrong movie, but for those who just want to see the icon that is Jason Voorhees slash away at horny teens with his machete, then you will enjoy every second at Camp Crystal Lake.

Edit (6/18/09): The Blu-ray looks good and the killer cut is much better than the version I saw in theaters. I don't know why they edited some of the best kills before, but now all the carnage is here and it's bloody beautiful.",1241654400,4,1431,4.2153284671532845
236782,5,6300214087,"Aaah Friday the 13th, love it or hate it everyones got an opinion.  And the series and Jason Vorhees as much as it's detractors, critics, etc etc deny, it was as much a part of 80's pop culture as hair-metal and Michael Jackson.

So finally after all these years Paramount has finally released it uncut, is it worth it?  Depends on your point of view.  As a die hard Friday fan I say yes.  But here's the thing, don't go into this expecting a bloodbath.  Remember this movie came out in 1980, just like Psycho might've been graphic in 1960 and looked tame in 1980.  Friday the 13th in the words of Bart Simpson ""pretty tame by today's standards""

But I bet people in 2029 will be saying the same thing about Hostel and Saw.  That's the drawback of gore, it doesen't age well.

The dvd itself is well done and I have 1 minor complaint.  The commentary track consists of quotes taken from other sources and is not the cast and crew watching the film and commenting as they watch.  Some of the comments from director Sean Cunningham are lifted from the extras for example.  But that's just a minor gripe.

Now to address a falshood by  LUV2SHOP@AMAZON, this dvd is uncut. the 2 scenes he mentions were never filmed.

I've read about  Brenda supposedly being shot with an arrow on camera.  However this was from a fansite and neither is mentioned in the commentary, or on the bonus features or on the excellent His Name Was Jason documentary or even on IMDB's entry on Friday the 13th.

The second one is common among Friday fans.  The picture of Claudette(the girl killed just before the opening credits) with a hatchet in her neck was not a still from the movie but was a photo taken on set for the horror magazine Fangoria.

It seems like some fans are just fishing for reasons to bash the release when they really have nothing to complain about.  I mean really, it's the same with My Bloody Valentine, we've been calling for this for years. Paramount delivers and your still complaining?  Give me a break.  You know they're gonna look at this and figure they're damed if they do damned if they don't and will still treat Friday fans like a red headed stepchild.

The transfer is fine
The film is uncut

Quit your whinning your all acting like spoiled little kids, never satisfied.  While Paramount deserves all the flack it's gotten for not treating the Friday films right, they deserve credit for releasing the first film uncut and while it would've been nice if it was uncut, releasing 3 in 3-D.",1241568000,7,2497,4.503340757238307
236783,4,6300214087,"In 1980, Pamela Voorhees set out to kill all the counselors at Camp Crystal Lake. Several years ago, the counselors did nothing as Mrs. Voorhees' son, Jason, drowned in the lake. Now, as the camp is about to re-open, Mrs. Voorhees has returned to seek revenge for her son and she only has one more victim before she accomplishes that goal. Unfortunately for Mrs. Voorhees, she didn't count on this particular camp counselor decapitating her and ending her reign of terror once and for all. Unbeknownst to anyone at the time, Jason was still alive and witnessed his mother's gruesome death. Now, in the present day, Jason is the one who seeks revenge and anyone who even comes near Camp Crystal Lake is at risk of feeling his onslaught.

It's been something like five and a half years since we last saw Jason Voorhees in the theater. So was it worth the wait? Does the remake measure up to the rest of the franchise? Is it a remake worth seeing at all? Does it continue the trend with 2009 being a strong year for the horror genre? The short answer to all of these questions is yes.

I've always been partial to the Friday the 13th franchise. Jason Voorhees has always been my favorite when it comes slasher films. So I was beyond excited by the time this hit theaters. The film opens with a flashback that chronicles what would be the ending to the original film. Jump to the present day. Some kids decide to hike out into the woods to have some fun and wind up about a half mile from Camp Blood. Everything is fun and games until one of them turns up missing. The survivors wind up exploring and get picked off one by one while Jason wears a bag over his head. After the scene in the trailer where Jason runs towards the girl on the ground and swings his machete, we get a black screen with ""Friday the 13th"" in red plastered across it. Six weeks later, Clay is looking for his sister, Whitney. She was one of the victims of the attack we just witnessed. It seems as though everyone has given up hope looking for her except him. Meanwhile, Trent and his friends are going up to his dad's cabin for the weekend which just so happens to reside on Camp Crystal Lake. It's basically just more pigs being sent out to slaughter from there. Jason's bag gets pulled off right before he disposes of one of his victims in a barn. It's there that he stumbles across a hockey mask and things begin to pick up from there.

The film definitely delivers in all of the elements that make up the formula to a Friday the 13th film. There's plenty of T&A and sex for any sexhound. I haven't seen any R-rated film with this much nudity and sexual content in quite a while. The kills are also pretty satisfactory for a Friday fan. I think Trent's death is probably the most memorable, but I'm partial to Amanda's death because it was an interesting twist on the sleeping bag kill. Officer Bracke's kill was also a favorite of mine. Then, of course, there's Jason's death. It's interesting since it seems obvious how things are going to turn out for Jason, but it winds up happening in a round-a-bout way. Something is thrown in there to throw the audience off and that not many would see coming. Kind of like a, ""Oh, maybe he'll die this way instead,"" kind of thing. Thinking back on it, it also felt like a throwback to one of the earlier sequels, which is pretty cool.

We can't finish this review without talking about Derek Mears as the man behind the hockey mask. I feel like he did a great job. I prefer him over Ken Kirzinger in Freddy Vs Jason. He kind of reminded me as a cross between C.J. Graham(part VI) and Kane Hodder(parts VII-IX). He also ran at times, which may put some people off. I actually enjoyed the running quite a bit. It reminded me of Jason in The Final Chapter, which is my favorite F13 film. He had the body movements down to perfection and is a worthy addition to the list of actors who have donned the hockey mask.

My one complaint is that it seemed like it was hard to see what was going on in certain scenes. The camera would be too shaky or scenes wouldn't have enough lighting and be too dark. It's really a minor complaint though as it usually only lasted a few seconds when it did occur.

So, all in all, I feel like it was well worth the wait for this film. I am really hoping it does well because I would welcome sequels with open arms. The remake follows the Friday the 13th formula extremely well. Right down to the ending. I guess the only thing that's not like some of the previous sequels is the acting, which seems to be top notch for a slasher film. As a Friday the 13th fan, I'm more than satisfied with the remake. To tell the truth, it was just nice to see a film with Jason Voorhees in theaters again.

236784,3,6300214087,"In 1980, Steve Christy has decided to re-open Camp Crystal Lake, otherwise known as Camp Blood. A young boy drowned in '57 and a double murder followed the year after.  They have about two weeks before camp starts, so all of his counselors are beginning to show up to help get the camp ready. But when the counselors begin getting picked off one by one, it seems as though the same fate that cursed Camp Blood over twenty years ago still plagues the camp to this very day.

I don't like this film as much as other Friday the 13th fans seem to. I realize it's the original and it started the franchise, but I feel like something is missing. As much of a Jason fan that I am, I always viewed this one as the one in the franchise missing the key ingredient. That has always kinda made me overlook this film until I'm finally sitting down and watching it.  The uncut version is a bit of a tease as I think with the uncut scenes we get an extra eight to ten seconds of extended footage of a few of the kills. It's nice to see the best parts of the film the way they were meant to be seen, but it won't make me rush out and buy the new DVD at full price. I'll wait for the price to go down or find a used copy at a more reasonable price. I'm not taking anything away from this film though. It's still a lot of fun and I enjoy it. I'm just a sucker for Jason, I guess.

236785,4,6300214087,"First off, I'll say I didn't think it was a good idea when I heard they were remaking Friday The 13th - I thought they should have added another sequel to the existing continuity instead.  But the finished product proved me wrong - this new incarnation of the legend is a terrific horror movie that, while not the best of the bunch, is decidedly better than several of the lesser installments of the original cycle.

  A very brief prolgue re-creates the events of the 1980 original in miniature, and then the movie flashes forward years later, where a small band of campers is off onto an excursion into the woods near Crystal Lake.  By the night's campfire, the story of the local legend is told, a legend that only a couple of the campers have ever heard of.  At this point in the remake, the Jason Voorhees legend isn't universally known.  In the original series, the legend became world-famous, and by the ninth chapter (the under-appreciated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-Goes-to-Hell/dp/B00006FDBT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason Goes to Hell</a>) the legend had apparantly been accepted as at least partially factual by enough of the general population that it makes major national headlines.  But in this remake, despite the fact that it's been years since Jason's drowning and first return, the infamy of the character is apparantly only well-known among the locals.  It doesn't take long after that initial telling of the local lore for Jason himself to come roaring onto the scene in full mayhem mode.  The new incarnation of Jason doesn't seem as superhumanly strong or nigh-invulnerable at this point, but he's ferociously fast.  He's also more intelligent, which I'll get into later.

  The main focus of the movie is the brother of a girl who went missing in the woods six weeks prior, coming to look for her; he meets up with a group of people staying at a house on the lake, one of whom helps him in his search.  The search obviously leads right to the forest's legendary masked terror.  The remake is well-done on all fronts, with a solid story threading through rip-roaring horror blood and carnage, and a high level of sexuality featuring a gorgeous female cast.  The biggest change, and this is partly detrimental, is with Jason himself.

  The character's been changed, and I don't mean just the actor.  While he's still a menacing figure (and the added speed isn't a minus) it's Not the same Jason as was in the previous saga.  He seems to have lost some of that 'larger-than-life' element that made him such an icon in the first place.  He's smarter and plans more than at any point in the original cycle, even than in Part 2, where he still retained at least some reasoning faculties, even though they were partially buried under the form of what he was becoming.  And what he became was this force-of-nature type Creature with a tragic beginning and an inhuman present, acting out of rage and instinct with virtually no 'thought' going on.  At least until Freddy Krueger's machinations in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freddy-vs-Jason-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B0000VCZMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freddy vs. Jason (New Line Platinum Series)</a>&nbsp;seemed to start awakening some previously long-dormant parts of Jason's mind.  (That right there is one reason why they should have followed up with more sequels instead of a remake: Jason's conciousness was finally opening up and how was this going to play on his future actions?  He was still burning with fury and killer instinct, but did he actually act to Save one of Krueger's potential victims near the end?  Were we going to have a more conflicted Jason with contradictory instincts emerging?)  Here though, while this may change in future chapters (at least I imagine they're planning future chapters) Jason is very much a thinking hunter - at the dilipidated forest home he lives in he's even got it hooked up to power generators and knows how to operate floodlights and the like.  I think the only time he knew how to use machinery previously was in Part 7, with the power tool-like device, and I always thought that may have been a mistake anyway.  With Jason you've always had him as this primal force, and you never want to simply make him yet another 'big madman in the woods'.  This movie doesn't do that, but a couple of times it starts straying a little too close that way, so it's going to have to watch itself in the future. Even if they want to keep going with the 'thinking' Jason he can be just as effective, but they have to watch out for potential pitfalls.  They can't lose the 'sympathetic monster' feel and have him come off as just unmitigated evil.  Pure evil works great for Freddy, it wouldn't for Jason.  None of the potential shortcomings in the new Jason are the fault of his new actor, Derek Mears, by the way: he did a great job.  The cast overall does a fine job.

  Some random points worth mentioing: the cinematography works great (witness the 'ax-throwing' scene, for example); a cool, totally unexplained little glimpse early in the movie - did everyone notice the glimpse of those strange-looking wooden ruins they passed by? - some nice unexplained mystery there to add an extra angle into the movie, definate postive; and one more aspect that's another minus - they should have kept more of Harry Manfredini's original score (perhaps it can be added back in next time).

  It's hard to judge exactly where I fit this in on my list of favorites among the F13s; I want to watch the extended Unrated edition that'll be on DVD (apparantly something like 13 minutes longer.  Yay!) before I'll probably decide exactly where I stand on it.  (Sometimes highly anticipated sequels and remakes are like that - the first watch you're subconciously comparing it to how You wanted it to be; on the second watch there's more opportinty to appreciate what's there instead of what might have been there.  Case in point -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Episode-I-The-Phantom-Menace-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00003CX5P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;- I like that WAY better on subsequent watches {and with the hindsight of Eps. 2 & 3} than I did when I first saw it)  Regardless though, there's no way that this incarnation isn't a big success in its own right, and I'm loking forward to its getting its own sequels.  Will still always be thinking about where the original series would have gone if it had continued, but that doesn't mean this new series can't be great too.  Definately recommended for all horror fans (and if you're new to Jason, don't miss the originals!)",1241568000,,6800,5.100271002710027

I know these days that a lot of people want GORE, GORE, GORE but to me that DOESN'T make a TRULY good horror movie. Yes some gore is necessary in a horror movie, but you only need enough to get the point & the rest has to be emphasized on the atmosphere of the story..in other words the characters, the scenery, the plot. And without a doubt Nispel picked a place PERFECT for Jason to wreak havoc on his young victims. If you didn't know, Nispel directed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake & as you watch this film you can truly see the similarities in terms of scenery & even plot lines but still this movie stands out in it's own right.

236821,3,6300214087,"Well. Like i said about expecting more in this film, i wasn't 100% impressed which is why i gave it 3 stars. It kinda had a few minutes of 80's horror in it but obviously didn't much have that feeling to it compared to the ones people already seen and loved. the killings were pretty good except the girl getting hit by a boat and  not be knocked unconsious. How many people actually take a hit like that and still awake in the water? One little thing i noticed was Danielle Panabaker's 80's hair style that was simular to that girl from Friday the 13th part 3 who survived. Though Kane Hodder is my fave person to play Jason, Derek Mears did pretty fine job. I knew they would plan to make sequels to this but what really disappointed me was the ending. I thought it was lame and has been done. I plan to buy the dvd to this cause im a big fan and grew up watchin the movies over and over. One movie i might see but won't buy will probly be Nightmare ON Elm Street next year, cause i cant think anyone can fill in Robert Englund's shoes. But i might change my mind, i feel sorry for Wes Craven for vowing to go see it but who can blame him.",1240099200,,1141,4.071111111111111
236822,4,6300214087,"I am writing reviews for each of the Friday the 13th, but I own the box set and the older releases of the later two. The reviews are for those editions not the newer deluxe editions.

The first installment of the series is pretty mediocre, but it does open the door for one of the 80's best loved horror icons - Jason Voorhees.

The series is known for creative death sequences and not much of anything else. The first film features Kevin Bacon in an early role and like most visitors of Camp Crystal Lake doesn't last too long! Overall it's a fun Halloween flick with a memorable ending. I rate it 3 1/2 stars.

The DVD transfer looks pretty good and the box set has some cool extras.",1239667200,,685,4.294573643410852
236823,5,6300214087,"This Friday the 13th, which could have been easily named ""Friday the 13th, Part 12, instead of using the original name and confusing those who still insist that this movie is a remake (like my husband), is very entertaining and pays tribute to the original in a number of ways. I was glad to see that they included clips that told the original story. Ok, so those clips weren't from the original movie, but they still gave a backstory to help newcomers who aren't as familiar with the franchise understand why Jason is the way he is. In this new version, the actors are pretty likeable (at least some of them), and you find yourself hoping that they will get away from the machette wielding masked murderer, although, true to form, they almost never do. For once, the actors were not always cheesey and did a good job of making us relate to them.

Now, onto the flaws... I think one of the only characters I found flawed was the masked man himself. Am I the only one who found it sad and inappropriate that Jason suddenly was running after his victims? Never in any of the previous 11 Friday the 13th movies did Jason ever have to run to catch up to his ""prey"". It was a neat and spooky effect that all he ever had to do was create his menacing walk and no matter how fast and how long the victim ran, Jason was alway, always there, with no effort. It added to the strength of his character. Now, all of the sudden, he has to charge after them with full speed, and his arm strength seems to take more effort. In the older movies, he could snap a neck or throw an ax or other sharp object, or push a face thru a wall with just the flick of the wrist. Now it seems like he has to put a lot more force into it. They made him seem too human, and less like the undead, menacing creature that he really is. Lastly, his clothes are all wrong. In the old movies, he had work pants, huge work boots, and flannel shirts that may not have been worn out, but that were not new and that matched his scary physic. In this movie, we find him wearing what look to be a new pair of jeans, a less faded flannelish shirt, and yes, sneakers. What? These clothes did nothing to help his image. And to top it off, they picked a scrawny looking actor to play him. Jason never had chicken legs until now.

I did enjoy the movie very much, and can't wait for it to come to DVD. I can overlook some of the unusual events in the movie, such as the tunnels and Jason capturing the girl for no reason, but it's very hard to ignore the inconsistencies with the main character.",1239408000,,2546,4.2044989775051125
236824,1,6300214087,"This is the future of horror folks. Nothing but remakes. They call them ""Reboots"" or ""Re-imaginings: because they know people hate remakes. So they make up these new ""lie"" words to cover their butts.

This move stinks from the first second and on. Maybe I am biased because I loved the first series and would dearly love to see it keep going. Every new remake is just a ""Scream"" rip-off and they always follow those phoney cliched rules that horror movies are supposed to follow, but never really did in the first place.

This whole movie makes no sense at all. Characters talk endlessly about nothing and somehow manage to be redundant!!!  All the characters are greasy and sweaty looking and so is the movie. As if the lens were dirty. I've noticed that this is the trend with movies now. Tranformers comes to mind.

No one does anything logical or even remotely realistic.
A guy rides into town looking for his missing sister. He wants to place fliers around town. The police don't want him to. HUH???  The even pull him over in a squad car and tell him not to look for her. What the heck???
Then he tries to get the locals to post his fliers around and they all give him nonsensical reasons why they wont. Then he meet an old woman who seems to know all about what happened to his sister and she won't help and apparently he doesn't care enough to tell the cops about this. HUH ?????????? It just makes no darn sense. Even ""Crazy Ralph"" had less info to go on. Someone knows something about his missing sister and even knows who is responsible and he just shrugs his shoulders and moves on. UUUGGGHHHHHH???

Some characters sit around a camp fire and one dude says something like ""There was this massacre at a camp and this woman killed everyone because her son drowned and one person survived and killed her. But her son came back and saw her get killed."" ??????????????????????????
Then a guy asks one of the girls if she was scared by the story. WHAT THE HECK!!! How can you be scared by rambling sentence that makes no sense at all???  How could anyone have had any idea what he was talking about. It made no freakin' sense!!!

 We start off with a confusing recreation of the originals 1980 classics final moments. But this time making no sense at all. The only reason i could follow what was going on was because I had seen the original series. If I hadn't, I would have been totally confused. Why not just show the ending of the original movie? Because that would look like an ""old movie"" and the twelve year old girls they aim horror films at wouldnt want to see that. (""Eeeeeew, this looks old!"")

Jason's mom is mad because he drowned. she is killed and moments later a living little boy emerges. HUH???
She says he drowned and she killed everyone. Then he shows up alive. Did he drown???  or didn't he????
Why does she think he did??  Who the hell is his mother?? Why is she there? If he did drown, why is he here now?  Did he just drown that day or was it twenty years ago like in the original?  We are never told. Who is Jason anyway? What's wrong with him? Apparently they live at the camp and Jason even has his own room there. Yep, that make s sense. What the ....???????  Again, if i had not seen the original I would have had no idea what any of this meant. And it still made little sense to me.

Then we are forced to listen to a seemingly endless and redundant conversation about marijuana farming. I realize that everyone in Hollywood loves marijuana and everyone who loves marijuana loves to talk about it twenty four hours a day, but this is outright cruelty. After this we get an endless tirade about GPS Systems. Yes. a guy babels on about his GPS system for what seems like an eternity. As if that weren't bad enough, the topic keeps coming up again and again. Do real people really talk like this in real life now?
So what we have here is a movie about pot smokers and GPSs!!  You might stay awake for a while.
Every time a new character appears, a drug deal is offered. HUH????
 I cant tell you how many times ive gone camping and some ""Deliverance"" looking yokels or vacationing college students offer to sell my friends and family drugs. Its just nuts!! Will Hollywood writers wrap their heads around the fact that clean cut strait edge people and druggies and homeboys don't hang out together.
Different social types don't mix in this way. Didn't any of these jokers see The Breakfast Club????
None of the characters are like-able at all. they are all jerks. Even the ""heroes"" are barely tolerable and you don't give a crap what happens to them.  They all look a lot alike too, which makes it difficult to care much.

  Jason, out of character, has kidnapped this guys sister and is keeping her hostage, HUH??????
Seems that he thinks she looks like his mother, but this is only hinted at and since the two actresses bare positively no resemblance to each other, you are likely to overlook this motive.

At one point a head is discovered. Is it his mothers head. It should be. But we barely get a look before a guy drops it. Boy, that sure was scary.

Did I mention that the woods look like Tarzan's jungle and that all of the locations, the camp, the town, the summer house, Jason's place, etc are all strangely close together. Walking distance. Oh, and of course there is giant marijuana, like something out of The Incredible Shrinking Man, growing everywhere.

Some ideas are borrowed from the original series, but are only presented as weak imitations.
The murders are all super lame and generally hard to see. But you don't care who dies anyway.
They are all whining jerks.  Why has jason started killing after thirty years? Why start now?
In the original series, he didn't kill until he was discovered, then he had to relocate a few times.

The killings are all digital crap and we don't have a Tom Savini or a John Carl Beuchler to present us with
live effects that really fool you. Its all done on a computer and we all know how it was done, so who cares.

Who in the hell is Michael Bay and why is he allowed to keep doing this garbage. The Texas Chain-saw remakes were pointless too and when I try to watch them, I end up turning them off and putting the originals on. The same reaction here. I had to go put Jason X on. Then I started to enjoy myself.

The upcoming Nightmare on Elm Street will really be lame. No Robert Englund??  The ugly kid from The Bad News Bears movies is Freddy?????  No one can replace Heather Langenkamp, just as the new Halloween proved that you cant replace Jamie Lee Curtis.

Goodbye Robert Englund, Goodbye Kane Hodder, Goodbye Tom Savini, Goodbye Heather and Jamie. Goodbye to Ray Harryhausen.

236825,4,6300214087,"First off, despite the title of the film being ""Friday the 13th,"" this is NOT a remake of the 1980 classic. It is more of a film based on the first four Friday the 13th films. Some have referred to it as a ""greatest hits"" album of Friday the 13th. You can look at it that way.

The plot covers two seperate groups of party hungry beer thirsty kids who wind up getting slashed to pieces by Jason Voorhees. The real story line of the film revolves around Clay who is searching for his ""missing"" sister Whitney. This girl winds up being the one victim Jason actually keeps alive in his lair. We come to find out that it is because she reminds him of his mother when she was younger, with the picture in the locket. The story line is very traditional. It reminds you of Rob's story from Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984). It is very to the point, because Friday the 13th is not about deep plot development.

The music was a little bit lacking. Some parts of the film were musically brilliant and right on key with the tone and feel of this particular film. Other musical moments were very bland and really needed Harry Manfredini (the muscician responsible for Parts 1-6, 9, and 10).

The acting was the same as every other Friday the 13th film. The acting is never as bad as people say it is, but the characters are not deeply developed, since they are only there to fill Jason's quota.

All in all, this was absolutely everything I really thought it was going to be. I, too, wished that they would have went more into Mrs. Voorhees, but for business reasons (they need to sell those action figures in Hot Topic) I understand why they basically re-capped Mrs. Voorhees and dove right into Jason. It was a fun film with Jason (played by Derek Meers) played absolutely perfect. Jason himself was very cruel and vicious in this film. He was unrelenting and would stop at nothing.

This film really took me back to my childhood memories of my (now legendary) Blockbuster Video VHS rental days. It was basically Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter on major steriods. It is only natural that the death scenes would be more brutal and cruel, because you have to do a lot more to shock an audience today then you did back in the 80s.

This was absolutely a perfect Friday the 13th film for fans of the series and fans of the slasher genre in general. If you are one of those people who think you are ""too good"" for the slasher genre, then why the heck did you watch this film anyway? It is Friday the 13th not Citizen Kane. If you are a fan of this series and genre you will absolutely love this film.

Friday the 13th (2009) truely is a ""greatest hits"" album of Friday the 13th. The death scenes for the most part are basically re-doings of many classics kills (arrow to the head) and some of them are basically re-doings of classic kills, but with a new twist (sleeping bag...burn).",1238025600,,2880,4.392120075046904

What is amazing is the quality of the film...Blu-ray really shines here; you notice immediately the quality versus the grainy film of the past.

For example: in the scene where Brenda goes to brush her teeth and Mrs Voorhees is in the ""shower"" staring at here and you see the curtain move with what looks like fingers...here you can actually see the fingers.

They ruined for me one of my favorite slashers of all time, and made his screen presence about as comical as a clown with a knife instead of the hockey mask-wearing, machete wielding, killer that he was. This movie wasn't just full of blood and gore, but you can tell they actually put more time into the story instead of being sloppy and throwing any old story together just to make money.",1237334400,2,669,4.491803278688525

There are some small snippets in there which are only a few seconds long and which aren`t that great to waste another 12 $ on the movie because it`s labeled uncut.

But at the time they scared us so we watch them for the sentimental value. Slasher horror movies are not supposed to be intelligent and the ones that tried failed miserably. Theres SUPPOSED to be dumb college kids and slutty girls that's what makes it fun watching them die. Being over critical of a movie like this is just pointless, its not supposed to be taken seriously.

I do not debate the genius behind the development of the original film.  Jason is an icon in horror cinema.  However, this version is steered by strong actors, a hefty budget, and outstanding production value.

Bottom line:  Friday the 13th is back and better than ever.  Jason stands at the top of the heap of the current horror-film remake craze.

236904,4,6300214087,"Released Friday the 13th, February 13, 2009.
  And now the long-awaited 12th Friday the 13th film has entered our campsite.
  For those who have seen the original, first Friday the 13th (1980) and the second, Friday the 13th, Part 2 (1981) will know what is going on.
  The film series is nearly 30 years old, so this time they have gone back to the beginning for the younger generation and made a re-boot movie, so they very quickly go over the premise of part one. Archive footage from Paramount Pictures could not be used, of course, so they filmed their own background story. You won't see Adrienne King or Betsy Palmer in this one.  The story in this new movie is a combination of the Friday the 13th, Part 2 and Friday the 13th Part 3 (1982). However, you might not even recognize it as the story does take place in the present day.
  The pre-title story story is a female counselor (Stephanie Rhodes) being chased through the forest by a maniac woman (Nana Visitor). She is Jason's mother and is trying to kill the counselor. However, the counselor beheads her instead. Nearby, the child Jason (Caleb Guss) saw what happened.
  The second pre-title story is set 29 years later, in the present day.
  Five young adventurous adults are using a GPS device to find a marijuana crop. According to the device. they are only 1/2 a mile near, so they decide to camp there for the night.
  Wade (Jonathan Sedowski) is so scientific and really wants to find this crop while the others are only interested in sex. Mike and Whitney (Nick Mennell, Amanda Righetti) decide to walk off somewhere and find Camp Crystal Lake. As Wade walks a little bit outside their campsite to urinate, he finds the rop in full bloom. It was really closer than they thought. Suddenly, he is murdered by Jason the killer (Derek Mears).
  Richie and Amanda (Ben Feldman, America Olivo) are making love in the tent. Jason finds them too.
  Six weeks later, Clay (Jared Padalecki) is looking for his sister, Whitney, at Crystal Lake. Later, he comes across a cabin occupied by vacationers Trent (Travis Van Winkle), Jenna (Danielle Panabaker), Chewie (Aaron Yoo), Chelsea (Willa Ford), Nolan (Ryan Hansen), Bree (Julianna Guill) and Lawrence (Arlen Escarpeta).
  Arrogant Trent is using his father's cabin and is full of anger as it is. The guests are not having too much of a good time with him as a host.
  Clay knows Trent and his girlfriend Jenna. Trent does not like Clay. However, Jenna decides to go help Clay on his search.
  The vacationers have no idea about the murders of Crystal Lake. They are just there to have fun, but Jason is lurking and has bloody plans of his own.

  The film never really gets into why Jason has become a murderer as they did in the original Friday the 13th (1980).
  As for myself, being a horror movie fan of the Friday the 13th movie series, I thought it was a bore in the beginning, but really did pick up in the middle and it was like the old time horror again.
  I highly recommend you see, the first 4, Friday the 13th movies and Friday the 13th: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989) is cool too.
  The last film was Freddy Vs. Jason. Guess who wins?

236905,3,6300214087,"I was born just shy of the 80's and spent my childhood years(my best years)growing up in that wonderful decade. There was a lot of great stuff and so many things I look back on fondly and with great nostalgia. I grew up during the big 80's slasher boom, and even though I missed out on a good chunk of it in the theater(until later in the decade), I still didn't miss out thanks to VHS(R.I.P.)and cable. Friday The 13th was huge, and it was the one I probably saw most of, probably since there were more of them. I loved the series because it wasn't anything more than a slice and dice, set 'em up and knock 'em down machine. Like your favorite fast food joint, you know what you are going to get. As the series went on, it was still fun, but it lost a bit of the early feel. I much prefer the first 4(and I love 6), than the Kane Hodder years. Apparently, the makers of this new movie did too. So, as a kid who gew up on Jason and his peers in the 80's, I was happy to see Jason and the series return more to it's roots with this re-boot, or whatever it is they are calling it. Here we go....

The plot?. Like every movie of it's kind, it's simple and basically nothing more than a set up for pretty young kids to get horribly butchered and cut up by one nasty guy in the woods. Clay(Jared Padalecki, from ""Supernatural""), is searching for his sister Whitney(Amanda Righetti), who went missing after the film's opening minutes. He encounters a bunch of young kids partying near the infamous Camp Crystal Lake, but also encounters something far worse. Jason Voorhees doesn't like intruders, and he goes about weeding out the crop of good looking young'ins. Sound familiar?. You betcha!.

It's not really about plot, is it?. This is Friday The 13th, and it's about a high death count(check), gorgeous women(check), gratuitous nudity(check), sharp instruments(check), and implausibility(check). This new film goes through all the cliches one expects and exploits them in all their glory, instead of standing back and winking and laughing at them and turning them on their head. Then again, it was probably on purpose. If this was to be a ""root"" F13, then all of the classic elements are here to be used and not poked fun of. Sure, it's mostly cheesy, but then that is part of the fun. There is a retro type vibe and feel to the movie, while at the same time feeling very ""now"". A classic, old fashioned F13 movie in a world where it's not supposed to of all happened yet. It's Jason, but different. Speaking of Jason, he runs, walks fast, and is an absolute monster to reckon with. Derek Mears is really good as Jason. He is strong, huge, and gets his point across....usually through your skull. I have always liked Jason as more of a deformed human than a rotting, slimey, supernatural zombie. The mask also looks great. Classic hockey mask.

Elsewhere, the rest of the cast is serviceable and nice to look at, but there are no Jamie Lee's, Johnny Depp's, or Kevin Bacon's in the bunch. Padalecki has come into his own on ""Supernatural"", but he is stuck with a pretty typical role here. Most of the girls are here to show off their assets, and the rest of the guys are the ""jerk"", the ""funny guy"", and the ""token black guy"". There is really only one person here you want to see get offed. The others you really don't want to see get it because they don't deserve it. And how do they get it?. Some may find the deaths to be a little tame and subdued compared to the level violence has ascended to in these films in recent years. There is no ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"" like savagery here, thank god, but neither is there a great, classic F13 kill set piece. There are 13 deaths, but no real stand-out.

In the end, F13 was a film I supported getting the re-make/re-boot/re-imagining treatment. I love it, but I wanted them to go back to their roots and make a classic Jason film. I mean, what else could they do?. Jason Takes Tokyo?!. F13 is, quite obviously, no great art, but it is what it is and doesn't pretend or want to be anything else. If this is how you like your Friday The 13th or horror/slasher movies in general, then the movie should be fun, entertaining, and satisfying. It tries to bring some classic F13 touches in there, some nostalgia, and it mostly works. However, it would be nice to have real characters at some point. People there meant to be more than just machete fodder and to shake their behinds....nah, this is Friday The 13th.",1236470400,,4443,4.434516523867809
236906,1,6300214087,"Marcus Nispel made a dark, brutal and humorless remake of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Here he has failed miserably. Not only do we finally not get a look at the origin of Jason Voorhees, instead we get a quick rehash of Mrs. Voorhees demise which immediately has a fully-grown Jason picking up the machete and continuing the family tradition. Then it gets boring and predictable while waiting for Jason to dispose of the mostly despicable teens who make the mistake of staying near his domain. There is not a single character who makes you care about what happens to them. They all seem to be mostly degenrates who seem to exist only to have sex, drink and take drugs. The story, such as it, is muddled and confusing and gives us absolutely nothing we haven't seen before, except perhaps for more nudity and more graphic simulated sex acts. Far more entertaining by far is My Bloody Valentine 3D.",1236038400,8,906,4.70440251572327
236907,3,6300214087,"We finally get this slasher film uncut, but what does that really mean?

-The throat slitting is extended by 3.5 seconds showing a lot more blood come out and the wound opening up more.

-Keven Bacon's arrow death is extended by a whopping 5 seconds and features a new angle followed by the one in the cut version. Deffinatly a big difference.

-The axe to the face is extended, and it doesn't cut away untill the girl slides and hits the floor (the cut version cuts away almost instantly) ... The scene is extended by 3 seconds.

-The scene where the dead body is hanging on the door is focused on for an extra 4 seconds. Since the transfer is a lot better, it's easy to see all the stab wounds and the arrow going into the eye. Bloody as the movie gets.

-The scene where the girl gets thrown through the window is extended by a second or two as it focuses on the dead body. Not really noticable.

-Mrs. Voorhees's decapitation is the biggest difference as the camera is more focused on the wound instead of pointing to the side. The scene is also extended by at least 7 seconds.

The transfer is really what makes this dvd worth owning. It's much easier to see what's going on with the scenes that take place outside, which wasn't the case in all the other releases.

The features are that decent. We have a 10 minute featurette, a 20 minute convention interview with a lot of the people who worked on the film, a fan film, and the trailer. If that intrest you, then there you go.

The film itself isn't that great. The second half is slow and the first half is full of meaningless dialouge. The acting isn't that great either. What makes the movie worth it is the body count which is made up of great kill scenes topped off with amazing gore effects.",1235865600,3,1754,4.339449541284404

236909,1,6300214087,"Marcus Nispel( the director of the Texas chainsaw remake) should have ran to the hills when he read this awful script to this movie. The writers were trying to make the same exact movie from the first Friday the 13th and failed....MISERABLY!!!
  First off,was this movie a porno or a horror movie? There was some much sex, nudity, sexual innuendo, fanticizing to a mannequin and a bass pro shop catalog, dirty talk; you would think you were watching a porno film. Then, you would watch teens getting hacked in predictable ways. Sorry, but these two DO NOT MIX in todays horror genre.
 The only small lifesaver of this movie was when a brother of a girl who disappears at Crystel Lake goes to look for her, and finds out the secret of Jason, his hideout and so forth. If the moviemakers were smart enough, they should of revolved the movie around this small subplot and get rid of the teens, who could hardley act out of a paperbag.
 If you decide to rent this garbage, just watch the first 15 minutes and whenever the guy is looking for his sister and the last 15minutes and you will see a horror film. The rest is Teens having sex and bad acting.
 Those who like the original will be divided on this film. If you want the same movie as this one and never seen the original, watch that one. and stay away from this predictable,somewhat snuff film.",1235520000,3,1347,4.459349593495935
236910,1,6300214087,"When Marcus Nispel remade the Texas Chainsaw Massacre horror fans took issue with a few elements of that movie (notably Leatherface's family and the overall ending.) But he still managed to restore a sense of identity and terror to that landmark franchise.
  Now remaking Friday the 13th, Jason fans are looking for him to revamp the Jason mythos. No such luck. Remember how the original Friday the 13th at least tried to establish a backstory for the reasons for the slaughter to come? Nispel spends a grand total of two minutes revisiting the classic climax between Alice & Jason's mother (""You let him drown! You never paid any attention!"") After that, it's discarded altogether so Nispel can get right down to the hack n' slash. Nispel must have figured; ""Eh, everyone knows it"" and not bothered to explain Mrs. Voorhees motives in depth. Since this is a remake of the original you would think he would. But instead we get right on to the killing of brain dead teens for no other reason than they're there.
  One of two problems with this flick is the victims in this movie don't act like real people. They act every bit the gallery of horror victims long established in slashers. Friday films have never been the hub of brilliant writing but in this flick they spout dialogue so inane you get the feeling this would've worked better as satire.
  The other problem is that the kills are not at all inventive. With the exception of the great scene of a girl burning to death in her sleeping bag suspended over a fire, all the kills are throat slashings, bludgeonings, axes in the back, etc. If Friday the 13th is revered for anything, it's inventing new ways to DIE BABY!!!!
  And to top it all off, Jason ends up at the bottom of the lake AGAIN!!!
  Supposedly, this remake covers the first four Friday films, but why bother with that? Most of the sequels were indistinguishable from each other. Better to concentrate on the first one and build something more fresh. Now we get possibly several more years of generic, blase sequels. Hooray.",1235347200,4,2044,4.6685236768802225
236911,2,6300214087,"First of all, let me make it perfectly clear that I absolutely love, love, love the original ""Friday the 13th"", in fact back in the days when I used to work in Special Make-up and Creature Effects I was honored to get the chance to work on one of the more forgettable sequels.  As a film, ""Friday the 13th"" delivered a new level of shock, terror and horror that, for the time, was unparalleled in cinema.  It is suspenseful, it is dark, it is intense, it is completely entertaining, and it will go down in film history as one of the all time great slasher films of the 80s.  With that being said, it makes what Paramount calls a Blu Ray version of ""Friday the 13th"" all the more disappointing and that is the focus of my review and the reason for the one star.  Basically all you are getting for your Blu Ray bucks is an  exact copy of the SD DVD version transfered onto a Blu Ray Disk...that is it.  The quality of the print would be poor even for a SD DVD version and in no way has Paramount remastered this to the Hi Def standard one would expect when slapping the Blu Ray label onto the box.  Let me put it to you this way, it's like buying a bottle of coke, opening it up, taking a sip and then realizing that it is just the generic, stale store brand impostor and not real coke.  It's close, but it 'ain't coke.  Don't sell me a film claiming it's in a Hi Def format when all you've done is basically packaged a Standard DVD onto a Blu Ray disk and stuck it in a Blu Ray box.  Not only is that disappointing, but it is deceitful and wrong!  If you are purchasing this film expecting to see it remastered into glorious Hi Def then you are being duped into believing a lie.  This print in no way resembles Hi Def.  When I go to a restaurant and order filet mignon you can best believe that they better bring me a filet and not ground chuck.  This Blu Ray disk is ground chuck packaged as filet mignon.

Now, in regards to the extra footage, that was also a disappointment and, in fact, it does not add to the film but rather takes away from the original look and impact of the special effects this new footage is supposed to be enhancing.  It is easy to see why some of the footage was left on the cutting room floor since it seems to make some of the special effects look so obviously cheesy and fake that if you didn't know how they were done before you most certainly would after viewing their newly edited presentations.  In particular, in the ""uncut"" edition there is an awkwardly long hold on Annie after she gets her throat cut rather then the quick fade out of the original version, and in doing so this absolutely diminishes the shock and impact of this, the first graphic murder of the film.  In addition, there is a horrible overhead camera angle of the Kevin Bacon ""arrow through the throat"" death that completely destroys the realistic illusion created by the original 3/4 camera view angle.  So if you are buying this because you think you're going to see better or gorier effects, then don't bother because you'll only be in for a big let down.

All in all, as I said at the beginning, ""Friday the 13th"" still shines as one of the best slasher films of the era and because of that it deserves an equally awesome Blu Ray transfer, unfortunately this is not it.  Do yourself a favor, save some money and buy the standard DVD version in it's proper labeling, not this impostor in a Blu Ray package with a higher price tag.

I can say without a doubth, that this movie is WAY BETTER than any of the previous sequels.

The problem is instead of a group of random people some stuff happens to, there is a horror icon involved. They take a smart approach by picking up a couple decades after Friday the 13th. They blend in elements of parts 2 and 3, and ignore the stuff that followed. This approach pays respect to the original and grounds the franchise in the present while freeing it from the crazy story lines of the later installments( they're fine and they are still there, no need to freak out).

I was a fan of the older films and some were better than others, but nevertheless they were classic films that helped shape the way horror films were made.  I was hoping that a remake would keep the same magic that the original series had.

This movie was amazing!!!  It had profanity, drug use, violence, gore, suspense (not only in the last fifteen minutes) and nudity. These were the staples of the films in the 1980s, so it was good to see that this remake didn't wander too far from its roots.

I found Jason to be a bit more violence and foreboding in this movie than in some predecessors.  The characters in this movie were routine, but still interesting, even the story was good.  I am sure there are some people who will complain about this movie.  However I would find it hard to believe that someone who loved the original movies would not like this 2009 version.

236941,5,6300214087,"**This Review Has NO Spoilers!!!**

I've been a fan of the series for quite some time. Having seen all the other movies at least 5x's (some of them more), I was excited about the ""remake."" And when I learned Nispel & Bay were involved I got even more excited! I'd seen their work with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre/dp/B00018D44K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>&nbsp;and was highly impressed. I knew that if anyone could do a good job of bringing back my favorite slasher it would be these guys. And they did not disappoint!!

Fans of the series might be a bit let down on some aspects that were left out, since this was to incorporate the first 4 films of the series. It did take certain key elements from each (moreso from Parts&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/II/dp/B001K9OXE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">II</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/III/dp/B001K9OXEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">III</a>) and added many more, enveloping the entire experience in a murky soup of bloody water.

Jason is faster, more brutal, less bumbling, & overall more scary than any other in the series. Though I love what Kane Hodder has added to the series, I just can't picture his style of Jason working in this movie. The characters are pretty solid, with a few rememberable stand-outs. There is some nudity in here, but you'd expect nothing less from a Friday film.

I really think fans & newbies to the series will love this movie. You don't have to see every movie to understand what happens; in fact it might be better if you didn't! I'm looking forward to this one coming out on DVD. It can't come soon enough!!

Long live Jason Vorhees!!",1234828800,7,1822,5.808988764044944
236942,3,6300214087,"This is a straight forward slasher film.  No jokes.  Simple story.  Cliche'd setting, and one dimensional characters that show maybe one recognizable and memorable trait before they're dispatched.  This is exactly like the earlier Friday films on every level.  I knew going in that this was billed as a remake, even though Jason is the star, and he didn't really appear in the first Friday the 13th, but this isn't really a remake of the first film.  It's more of a greatest hits album of Friday's 1 through 4.  I swear.  Jason gets his mask in this film(part 3), the main characters are just partying up at a cabin(part 4), Clay is searching for his lost sister and eventually becoming a Jason hunter(part 4), we get a quick recap of the end of the first Friday with Mrs. Vorhees and her loss of head, the way our 'final girl' tricks Jason at the end is similar to that of part 2, the ending of the film has basically the same 'surprise' jump scare, and finally Jason himself is more like he was in the first four films.  The way he's built, the way he moves, the fact that he's still human.  We even get an appearance of the sack doning Jason from part 2.  Fans of the series will smile when they see some of the kills from Fridays' past making cameos as well, but they have been tweaked or put in different locations.  Just two quick examples are an arrow through the head and a death by sleeping bag.  Yes, they are throwbacks, but they play out in a slightly different manner in this one.

Here's the problem and the reason for the average star rating:  THERE'S NOTHING NEW OR ORIGINAL IN THIS FILM.  The writers and director don't subvert or transcend the material, in other words they don't really make it their own beyond the new glossy look.  The only original thing they seem to have added was Jablonsky's score, which if you thought the original score was obvious, wait 'til your ear drums are blown out by the soundtrack in this thing!  To say the music has scary stings would be putting it lightly.  They are more likened to musical explosions whenever something scary happens or Jason just happens to appear.  It's cheap scare stuff, but it will make you jump just for the startling nature of loud noises out of nowhere.  It's kind of like clapping your hands together really hard right next to a sleeping geriatric's ear.  Not horror movie innovation or genius going on here.

People are going to go on and on about how much faster and stronger Jason is in this thing, but it's all just revisionist history.  Watch the original five, Jason was very agile and quick.  They'll also go on and on about how he's smarter.  He's not.  He's about as smart as he was in the originals.  The only wrinkle that is new to Jason's character is the whole survivalist in the woods thing.  Sure, you could surmize that about the originals, but this film gives you the visuals to show what an accomplished woodsman and hunter our friend Mr. Vorhees is.  Plus, we get a Jason lair.  This is an upgrade from the shack he used to have in part two where the only valuable thing it held was his mother's severed head, YUCK.

So, the film is watchable and fairly fun in that old Friday the 13th way, but it's nothing special.  It's not really scary.  It's violent, but no more than the originals and far less-so then the recent Saws and others of that ilk.  To call the characters card-board would be an insult to card-board.  But, in Friday the 13th land the characters were never the point.  The actors play their stereotypes as believable as possible, which is something this installment has over the originals, which were peppered with bad dialogue and bad acting.  And yes, I call this an installment, because it plays less like a remake and more like FRIDAY THE 13 PART 3.5.  This film could easily fit between parts 3 and 4 and it would feel natural.

***SIDE NOTE---Friday the 13th 3.5 is not a literal opinion on how this film could fit into the whole series.  It's a glib reaction to the lack of originality in this remake.  It was a reference to certain films that get re-released on dvd with new scenes and are given a .# added to the title.  Example would be Spider-Man 2.1.  Geeeezzzz people....***

So, old-school fans won't hate it, I suspect, but will rather feel comfortable in it's old-school conventions, but at the same time feel slightly empty at the fact that nothing new was offered to an already paper thin mythos.  New-school fans may love it, and find it original, especially if they've never seen an true balls-to-the-wall slasher film, but rather post-modern stuff like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.  This film's violence hurts and there are no cute remarks from the characters right before they buy it.  Death hurts again in this film.

My only thought at the end is, why remake this?  If they had nothing new to say or add to the franchise or character then, what was the point?  How was this creativly satisfying to anyone?  I dunno, you decide, but that's just the thoughts running through my mind at the moment....

DVD SPECIAL FEATURES UPDATED REVIEW 6/07/09
Yeah, New Line really skimped on this one, at least on the dvd end of things!  We only get two special features, an 11 minute making of doc and three deleted scenes.  All the deleted scenes are uselss.  We get an alternate death scene for the Donnie character who helps Jason make an important fashinon decision with his hockey mask, it's more gory and really poorly filmed and edited.  We get another scene with some cops, YAWN, and finally a shorter and less gooey demise for Mr. Voorhees.  The doc is filler.  No extenssive details about anything, just how excited and 'kewl' the whole experience of remaking Jason --BLAH, BLAH, BLAH...Totally LAME! Though, we do get some glimpses of Derek Mears suiting up and being put into his Jason make-up.  Plus, we get some alterante angles from the opening 'death of Mrs. Vorhees' prologue that gives the viewer a good look at Jason as a deformed child.

The movie itself looks great and has been extended by about 1 minute.  Yes, there's more Jason and some of the violence has been put back in with gory results, which is the real reason these films have endured anyway.  Though, the only major difference I noticed was in the token Asian guy's death by screw driver, it's longer and bloodier.  Either the movie is going to get some double dipping action in the near or far future or the newly sold New Line, now with Warner Bros., will be putting the good special features on their Blu-Rays.  Though, after looking up the Blu-ray specs, not really.  There's one extra special feature called 'Hacking back, slashing forward'.  This may be the more informative doc on the film's making, dunno.  There's also some BD live stuff, but who actually gives a crap about that?

I would've appreciated a commentary by the director and especially the very funny screenwriters.  Though, on the upside, there are extenssive and more telling interviews with them, and actor Derek Mears(Jason), on the very good 2-disc dvd release of HIS NAME WAS JASON.",1234828800,32,7086,4.586783439490445

  I probably didn't need to say that i may reveal spoilers of this movie.. as if everyone doesn't know what they are getting from a jason flick....  so here goes.. I watched the original friday the 13th when I was a kid, and I have watched everyone since then.  So did this movie add anything to the franchise?. NO.  did it need to be made? NO.  was it entertaining?  YES.  Older fans such as myself may not like it as much..
 here are a few things that I had issues with this remake
#1  Mrs Voorhees.  on screen for 5 secs.  was definately not as good as Betsy Palmer in the original.  That was a big disapointment for me.

#2 Jason burns one victim alive.  Jason does not torture his victims.. he is a cold, ruthless killer. not sadistic.

#3 Jason does not keep victims alive and hold them prisoner.  (see #2)

#4 Jason shows a lot more intelligence in this movie.  Jason is a mental midget.  not smart enough to pull off some of the things he does in this movie.
#5 I hated how jason got his mask in this movie.  oh well...
here are some of jason's improments..  He definately is a little quicker, stronger and more violent in this one.  So most audience members probably will not be to dissapointed.  Overall I think they did a good job and would recommend it.",1234742400,,1303,4.289256198347108
236944,3,6300214087,"Those old slashers, they're all coming back in a rush, and this time we get a re-imaging of the 'venerable' Ft13th franchise, ripe for 2009 cynicism.

The director also helmed the Texas Chainsaw remake in 2003, and both films have a similar look of decay.  Once again, we go inside the killer's lair and it's a nasty place.  Jason is ruthless, he moves faster and stronger but he's also a stalker and will use the old 'where did he go?' trick before the kill.

It could have been much worse.  The film will probably make a load of money either way, and Sean S. Cunningham will have done it again.  While Freddy vs. Jason was a bigger hit than expected, they let it sleep a bit and came back with...Michael Bay?  Yes, it is a bit disappointing.  New Line and Paramount, kings of the 80s slasher with two big franchises, now officially team up to clean up.

All these years after Scream, and countless parodies, and they play it the same way again.  A few demented touches, for sure (the scary old house and the lair are good), but with the same-old same-old for the 2009 set, and borrowing from every other movie you've seen.  There are definite hints of Wrong Turn, and I do like the standby dead cell phone signal in the sticks.  There's instantly-dead-cop-to-the-rescue (Wrong Turn) and the sudden-arrow-through-the-skull (also Wrong, turn, actually).  There's the druggies who get paranoid and killed, including a guy who arms himself with a wok before going into a dark tool shed to find his buddy.  There's the hiding girl, wondering where Jason is, before ::phoot::.  There are some sequences where you literally cannot tell what's happening because the cutting is so fast, though it does work well in a creepy way a few times (guy getting pulled through the floor).  There's a missing ear, complete with iPod earpud still in place (nice one).

They don't really do anything with the franchise but just reimagine the height of Jason's powers, out in the woods near some one horse town in New Jersey, where the cops are so inept they don't 'stumble' upon Jason's house and underground lair, which a couple of doofus kids manage to find in five minutes.  And I'm pretty sure that's the same old woman from the TCM remake who seems to know all about Jason but doesn't really mind living nearby.  Which brings up another thing...how come there are always a few locals in these movies who seem to have lived there forever, but not long into the movie they get it, too, just because...they live there.  Is Jason not a bit obvious?

Who cares, of course.  The film could have been better, could have been worse, if you already know it's a Michael Bay-association film, you may well know what to expect and adjust attitude accordingly.",1234742400,,2733,4.661795407098121
236945,4,6300214087,"WARNING: Do not read if you have not seen this movie!!!!

 I have to admit I was a bit disappointed with this movie.  I had been looking forward to it for a long time and it wasn't as good as I had hoped. I loved Michael Bay's remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and expected something similar in Friday the 13th.

I do like how they took the original four movies and used elements from each in the remake.  Mrs. Vorhees decapitation from Part 1, Jason's original one eye'd pillowcase(or is it some kind of sack?) over his head from Part 2, finding his hockey mask from Part 3, and the guy searching for his missing sister from Part 4 and I am sure there were others.

The beginning of this movie was awesome and actually creepy and was the reason I gave it four stars.  I love the scene with the first set of campers and how Jason offs each of them.  My favorite is the sleeping bag roasting over a campfire.  I really thought that opening was a set up for something awesome.  However, that did not happen.

The rest of the movie was still good, however I felt it was just a gradual build up to a climax that sadly never came.  This was the ultimate disappointment.

I still recommend any fans of the series to check out the remake and I still plan to buy the DVD when it comes out.",1234656000,,1281,4.200819672131147
236946,3,6300214087,"The latest ""Friday the 13th"" is not actually a ""remake"" of the original made back in 1980. If you remember the conclusion of the first ""Friday the 13th"" (or know the answer of one trick question Drew Barrymore had to answer in ""Scream""), you know you cannot tell the story of ""Jason"" exactly the same way as they did before about 30 years ago. For the newest installment Jason himself appears with his trademark hockey mask, and Jason, a versatile killer who makes use of various tools found in and around Camp Crystal Lake, kills more unsuspecting victims in a more gruesome fashion.

And probably that is all you have to know: increased body count and more blood and gore, plus nudity and graphic sex scenes. Jared Padalecki (Supernatural"") plays motorcycle-riding Clay Miller, looking for his missing sister. Damian Shannon and Mark Swift's script, which heavily borrows from ""Psycho,"" is full of incredible plot holes, but each set piece is decently done. Technically this is the best you can get, with fine production design and location, but those who have any knowledge of the horror genre will feel most scenes look familiar. Some characters keep doing very stupid things - see the last five minutes for yourself - they look as if parodying the genre's conventions, intentionally or not.

236989,4,6300214087,"Jason's been busy since we last saw him.  He's been preparing for this murdering spree.  With countless sex-craved, moronic, drug-smoking teenagers to disembowel, Jason realized he needed to step his game up a bit.  So, he started collecting the skills that would make an Eagle Scout envious.

He's taken up horticulture, harvesting a field of marijuana conveniently located near Crystal Lake.  His archery skills are refined, made painfully clear by a 200-yard, head shot with a single arrow into the orbital cavity of a boater going about 30 MPH (that's a great shot!).  He's fancied up the area, using his lighting and fixtures skills to set up flood lights near his dingy cabin where it appears he's on the verge of setting up some canoe rental business; there are a ton of'em.  He refined his already legendary hunting skills by tastefully hanging some ""meat"" on a deer rack in a rustic cabin, and littering the area with bear traps.  Not only that, but he's also been watching ESPN's Outdoor Games, because he can now throw a very mean axe with surgical precision.  Need to dig a trench or a tunnel?  Jason's got it covered; like a blood-thirsty, maniacal groundhog, he's built an elaborate underground tunnel system through which he can show off his aforementioned hunting skills.  He has even found time for cooking, his specialties being chick-ke-bobs and cop skewers.  Mmmmm.  And of course, we already know he's an avid hockey fan.

The main plot of this movie is nearly inconsequential.  Five teenagers make the mistake of A) camping near Crystal Lake, and B) finding Jason's stash.  Jason ruthlessly butchers them.  One of the missing girl's has a brother who searches for her.  Along with his quest, a new group of clichd and stereotypical college-aged kids take a vacation in a fancy cabin just off the lake.  Prepare for the slaughter.

What's great about this movie is that Jason gets top billing.  No supporting character details are really needed, and none are really given.  Jason is the star.  Who cares about the walking target practice and wild game that Jason's about to slaughter?  They're recycled, unimportant, and only need fulfill the classic Friday the 13th requirements before meeting their enjoyable - at least from the audience's perspective - demise.  That's not all!  The realistic gore of contemporary horror is a much needed shot in the arm for this franchise.  There's a perfect blend of impaling, eye-popping, and throat slashing goodness - particularly at the hands of Jason's tool of choice: the machete.

Jason is a bit more calculating in this one, more aware of his surroundings, more intelligent...and that's bad news for the idiots visiting Crystal Lake.  Jason teaches morality lessons as he eviscerates all pot-smoking idiots and the non-chaste.  Not only that, but he has a sadistic streak as well, torturing one of his victims to bring out another.  In my eyes, Jason is the hero.  HE should be the source of cheers.  Jason is the Picasso of murderers, the Mozart of the machete.  Cheer his greatness!  I know I did.

In summary:
Gratuitous nudity, sex scenes (with morality lessons), someone wanders off by themselves in the dark, completely pointless deaths, corny jokes (requisite for fun horror movies), a solid amount of blood spatter and flying brain chunks, good shock/jump scenes, and pretty good special effects.  Awesome

Why reinvent the wheel?  Aside from a flawed ending (the reason it's not a 5-star), this is a tribute to the Friday the 13th series, to Jason Voorhees, and it's near perfection.",1234569600,4,3559,4.967796610169492
236990,3,6300214087,"""Friday the 13th"" is the funniest horror remake of recent memory, which is not at all what I wanted. The ads promised a genuinely scary movie; what it delivered was a film that seemed to be a parody of itself, relying on the formula used by countless other teen slasher films, including the original ""Friday the 13th"" franchise that began in 1980. There are moments in this film that could have been truly frightening, especially since it achieved the correct look, with harsh shadows and dank chambers and unfamiliar locations. Unfortunately, those moments are overshadowed by tiresome clichs and dialogue so stupid, it's as if no thought was put into writing the screenplay. Was the intention to make a spoof? If it was, then it's hard to understand why the filmmakers even bothered to create such a creepy atmosphere or include a number of serious moments. Watching this movie, I kept wondering, ""Comedy or terror--make up your mind.""

One of the reasons I'm so disappointed is that the director is Marcus Nispel, who in 2003 gave us the remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" which I personally feel is one of the decade's best horror films. With ""Friday the 13th,"" he makes the dreaded mistake of going with style over substance; it's a film that looks good, and that's about it. Everything else is just an overload of recycled slasher material, such as the sex-crazed teens that drink too much before wandering off alone and calling out someone else's name. I'm always blown away by the sheer stupidity of these characters, so much so that I actually begin rooting for the masked killer to do what he does best. In the case of ""Friday the 13th,"" we root for the hockey-mask wearing, machete-wielding maniac Jason Voorhees, whose ability to keep coming back for more is nothing short of uncanny. Say what you will, but you have to admire his persistence. Well, maybe you don't.

The story: On June 13, 1980, Pamela Voorhees (Nana Visitor) went on a murder spree at Camp Crystal Lake, taking revenge on the counselors that let Jason, her deformed son, drown. When she's beheaded, Jason suddenly appears and hears his mother's voice in his head: ""They must be punished.... Kill for mother...."" Exactly how Jason appears, I'm not entirely sure; either this is some kind of supernatural thing, or he never actually drowned. Whatever the reason, he's been living in the woods around Crystal Lake for the past twenty-nine years, and he's ready to take care of those who dare to step on his turf.

Here enter a group of campers, all young, all well toned, all incapable of speaking without using four-letter words. One of them is Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki); he's tagging along so that he can ask the locals if they know the whereabouts of his sister, Whitney, who disappeared six weeks earlier with another group of young, well toned, foulmouthed campers. It isn't long before everyone ends up in a secluded cabin, at which point they discover that a serial killer is stalking them one by one.

In essence, that's the plot. Pretty much everything else is just filler. The characters, for example, are no more or less than goofy stereotypes, and their scenes are just ways to kill time between gruesome death scenes. One of the girls is a busty flirt who enjoys topless waterskiing. One of the guys is an arrogant jerk who can't get along with anyone. The only black guy occasionally has fun making his white friends seem racist. The only Asian guy has a bit of a drinking problem. And then there are the local folks, most notably the farmer that speaks in a Southern drawl and has really bad teeth. Mind you, we're not made to care about any of these people. That would mean actually adding depth the screenplay, and God knows that the last thing a teen slasher film needs is depth. No, we're only made to care about Jason, who can always find an interesting way to finish off his victims.

It would be too much to say that I expected something groundbreaking. But I definitely was expecting something that delivered as it promised, something made with the intention of being scary instead of being funny. There is, in fact, only one line of dialogue that actually got a chuckle out of me; in a drunken stupor, a character named Chewie (Aaron Yoo) happily exclaims, ""Let's be one big, happy clich!"" What a fitting line. Too bad no one thought of it sooner, even in a remake. Strangely enough, the fact that this movie is yet another remake doesn't bother me in the slightest. Truth be told, I'm no longer surprised by remakes. The industry is so inundated with them that it's now a normal practice, especially for the horror genre. At this point, I think it's safe to say that audiences are numb to it. That's a good thing, especially since remakes of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Hellraiser"" are on the way.

But blast it all, why was this particular remake trying to be a spoof? When a film is advertised as a horror movie, I expect to see a horror movie. ""Friday the 13th"" can't decide if it wants to be a comedy or a fright fest, and that above all made it difficult to sit through. The only horror I experienced was the thought of it spawning an endless series of sequels, as the original 1980 film did. Jason Voorhees is a menacing figure, but when you're forced to keep returning to life for the sole purpose of murdering idiotic teenagers, you're bound to eventually realize that the idea got old a really, really, really long time ago.",1234483200,2,5451,4.672916666666667

It's Jason, there is no real plot, other than the trademark kids in the woods getting killed off.
It really shouldn't be considered a remake, because it was a new take on the original, as it only goes over his mother in the first few minutes, and mid through the movie dawns the world famous mask, (isn't there untill mid way into part 3 of the old movies)  But it was still great.  It's Jason, doing what Jason does best.  It kinda took certain hallmark scenes from the first three movies, and did them more modern day, which was cool.  It had humor and most of the kids, I would have killed myself, as their personalities beg for punishment.

I can't tell you how many times I cringed and jumped when Jason attacked his victims.  There were innumerable shocks, and I won't spoil them for you.  Some death sequences were reminiscent of the previous series, but some were truly original, creative . . . and gruesome.

  This film is actually a remake of the first three films.  It begins on Friday, June 13, 1980 with Jason's mother loosing her head.  Jason, as a young boy, finds it.  Then it is the present and five attractive friends are camping near Crystal Lake.  A grown Jason wearing only a burlap sack over his head slaughters them.  Six weeks later, a young man comes looking for his missing sister.  Meanwhile, another group of attractive friends decide to vacation at Crystal Lake; instead of camping, they move into a rich man's summer home.  The slaughter begins anew.  This time, however, Jason finds and dons his trademark hockey mask.

  As in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" there is a strong conspiratorial element involving the local police and the neighbors, which I loved.  I will also add that there is a lot of unpredictability.  It was very difficult to guess who would survive the onslaught.  Some of the characters I really cared about, and some of them I truly detested and didn`t feel too much sympathy towards them when they died.  This is because the acting from the leads was very believable.

  I truly recommend that all Jason fans, young and old, see this remake.  You won't be disappointed.  It has a good body count and just enough gore to make it realistic without becoming disgusting.  No matter what the critics and other viewers may say about this film, I'm just glad that Jason has finally returned to scare me again.

You have all your classic slasher stuff here. A great iconic killer, numerous kills (13 in total), nudity from three hot chicks and not much plot. The acting is actually not too bad for the most part and there are even some humerous moments thrown into the mix. Most of the kills were good, but nothing as unique or gory as I was hoping for. There are some homages here and there from past flicks and it was cool seeing Jason go from potato sack over his head to the legendary hockey mask. The famous ""ki ki ki, ma ma ma"" music theme was nice to hear again, but it wasn't used nearly enough. This is no masterpiece by a long shot, but out of all the remakes the studios are pumping out these days it's one of the better ones.

236996,3,6300214087,"Friday the 13th is one of the most famous slasher films of all time, spawning sequels to the point of ridiculousness in which subsequent entries into the franchise practically parody themselves. Following a pattern even more impressive than the recent Saw films phenomenon, there was one new Jason film every year for an entire decade, skipping only a single year between Friday the 13th Part VI (1986) and Part VII (1988). None of the ideas in the film are all that unique, the music is a laughable cross between Psycho and Jaws, and the acting and dialogue are positively pathetic. Of course, the reason for watching such a horror movie is for the suspense, violence, nudity, gore and ultimate body count (a total of 10), which is served up generously in this 80's B-movie, with outstanding blood and makeup effects by the legendary Tom Savini.

In 1958, Camp Crystal Lake became known as ""Camp Blood"" to the locals after a young boy drowned and several vicious murders occurred shortly after. Present day finds a group of counselors working hard (which translates to goofing off and rolling in the hay) to re-open the rundown campgrounds for a new batch of kids. But just as soon as they start piecing the place back together, one by one the counselors are slaughtered by a machete-wielding maniac. (Look for an early role by Kevin Bacon.)

Friday the 13th struggles with seriousness, mostly resorting to campy dialogue and poor acting to connect the string of gruesome deaths. There's humor running through the majority of the slayings, even though spurting blood isn't shied away from. And once the killings start, the tiny bits of plot are completely pointless - each scene segues from one attack to the next. It's evident by the conclusion that we weren't even meant to guess the true identity of the killer. The deaths all seem to have a bloodthirsty infatuation with throats, whether it's slashing, slitting or spearing with an arrow. First-person perspective camerawork is used frequently to put the audience in the butcher's shoes, making the reactions of the victims more startling and the actual murderer invisible.

Notorious movie villain Jason Voorhees is most recognizable for his ghastly hockey mask, but this first film didn't even introduce that indispensable accessory. In fact, it isn't until the third part of the franchise that he finally dons the disguise. Although nothing about Friday the 13th stands out as incredibly imaginative, and the vexatious music is either a bad homage or a rip-off of Psycho versus Jaws, it isn't without a certain level of amusement; it either unmasks the deeply rooted bloodthirstiness in everyone, or it's just too much schlock to be anything but silly thrills. Through 11 more sequels, the formula never changes.

This movie does contain Jason but not as you will see him in the sequels. This one has Betsy Palmer as Mrs Vorhees doing the killing. It is the mother this time, which reminded me of the mother themes of Psycho. If you listen closely to the soundtrack, you will see touches of the Psycho theme, of which this movie was inspired by. Psycho is the single most influential horror movie in terms of what films it paved the way for in horror. The gore effects by Tom Savini are good, it wasn't as gory as I had thought, even in its uncut form. Kevin Bacon fans, see his early work before he was in Tremors & so forth. The transfer for this - the day scenes are fantastic, the night scenes still are a little dark but better than previous releases.
I recommend this to any gore fans, between this and My Bloody Valentine, horror fans can rejoice to see some uncut above horror slasher horrors..
The bonus features - interview with Sean Cunningham, and the Friday the 13th reunion were very insightful. The Camp Blood tale part 1 was pretty gory & creepy...

237038,3,6300214087,"Your level of acceptance for the last several horror franchise reboots will determine your appreciation for the latest installment in the Friday the 13th series, and a few ill words from us won't likely change your mind. But it does appear as if the creators of these slasher revamps have all but run out of new ways to kill people. The gruesome deaths caused by the hockey-masked serial killer (for whom we must root for due to a lack of interesting victims) feel dismally recycled, even if the level of bloody realism has been amplified by today's improved special effects. If you're looking for something more than extreme violence and gratuitous nudity it's best to look elsewhere, as all that's left are a handful of horror movie clichs and stereotypes mocking us for not more quickly recognizing their monotony. But perhaps it's unreasonable to expect more from the 12th film based on the same infamous killer.

In one of the longest opening sequences in recent movie history, five unsuspecting campers discover the terrifying truth behind the frightful legend of Crystal Lake as they are ruthlessly butchered by a masked madman brandishing a machete. Over a month later, when the brother of one of the initial vacationers comes looking for his missing sister, he encounters a group of wild college partiers seeking sex, drugs, and more sex. Little do they know that soon they will be running for their lives from a hulking murderer hell-bent on leaving no witnesses.

Friday the 13th serves as both a sequel and a remake - and to more than just the original 1980 film. The extremely lengthy opening basically sums up the events of the first two movies, and as it progresses, the best bits of Parts 3 - 9 also wind up in the mix. Voorhees acquires his signature hockey mask, and memorable death scenes keep getting repeated. It's undeniably a formula that never drastically varies, and as predictable as each victim's demise has become, there's entertainment to be had for those who enjoy jumping in their seats and flinching at every loud noise and sudden movement.

The stereotypes have gotten to the point where films like Scary Movie don't even need to parody them - this film mocks its own use of ethnic representation, cheesy dialogue, over-the-top violence and wanton behavior. Everything that's foreshadowed takes place, and everything that is supposed to happen inevitably does: the loner lead character steals away the girlfriend of the uptight jerk (who of course antagonizes everyone); the girls each take off their clothes, the guys who run off into secluded areas appropriately die, and everyone is quick to explore dangerous locations solo. It seems they wish to die as much as audiences take pleasure in seeing them squirm. This makes the true hero Jason, who is the only character that never disappoints, as evidenced by the expected conclusion; he's the only one that's meant to live on.

Like all of the inventive movie villains before and after him, Voorhees is the main reason fans keep coming back. At least an unintentional underlying message is positive: if you engage in sex, drugs and every other taboo staple of free-spirited teenage thinking, a maniacal machete-wielding mutant will kill you.

237039,1,6300214087,"I've now seen Cunningham's bag of blatant thievery 3 times in my life, and never again will I choose to sit down and view it.

Why?

It doesn't deliver in any respects of either the genre in which it stands (horror) or any aspect of film making in general; it's a quick cash in, like those DVDs you see on the new release wall that are vaguely similar to new Hollywood releases (Monster, What a Killer Calls, Snakes on a Train; you get the idea)

Cunningham took Carpenter's idea of a psychopath and made it, oddly enough just like Jason Vorhees, completely and utterly retarded. There is no intelligence to be found in the film at all what so ever, or in most cases, in the brains of the film's defenders.

Now comes a question of age, and with that comes a question of nostalgia; I'm 24, obviously I wasn't even alive when the first Ft13th was released, but I didn't grow up on the horror films of the 90's like I'm sure some of you overweight, balding and sweaty fanboys are ready to declare; no, I grew up on the Universal Monsters and Hammer Horror films, in regards to scares and thrills.

Later on in life I discovered the Giallo genre (Bava, Martino, Argento, and some of Fulci's films fall immediately into this category.); a genre vastly superior in every way to the American slasher film, which seem to be nothing more than watered down takes on the Italian genre; no wit, no style, nothing memorable at all, American film makers just took the T&A and violence aspect from those films & fed them to pre-teen or pubescent people in mass quantities.

Then there's the question of the, & this is, pointlessly, debatable, master of horror & suspense: Alfred Hitchcock; Friday the 13th's score, at least the one in the original, reeks of blatant theft from Hermann's score for Psycho, and the ""conversations"" between Jason's mother and ""Jason"" again stink of Norman speaking to ""Mother""; Cunningham takes Hitchcock's ideas and, again, Americanizes them; they're watered down, simply understood and perform solely on a base level.

The characters truly are a testament to a failed screenplay; relateable, how? I have a personality outside of one that can be found in a crackerjack box full of cliche and stereotypes, boring thoughts and comments and an absurd degree of stupidity.

And once again we see Cunningham dipping his hands into Carpenter's pot with the POV shots; at this point the film is completely lost to any chance of any sort of merit, be it of artistic or entertainment.

Horror works on two levels:

1.) It's realistic and it's a possible event: Funny Games immediately comes to mind.
2.) It's like a nightmare from which there is seemingly no escape: Suspiria is a high ranker in this regards.

Friday the 13th does neither; it simply wants your money, and if you were stupid enough to pay for it 29 years ago, chances are you'll never let go.

237041,5,6300214087,"I have always loved this movie and for the longest time had no idea there was extra footage (as quick and as short as they are) and with the release of this ""Deluxe Edition:Uncut"", I must say I was VERY satisfied. That wonderful and creepy soundtrack is in 5.1 surround and it sounds fabulous! As far as the extra footage as to what was cut out and now restored, it takes a REAL fan of the movie to detect them. The bonus features are great too but it really bothers me that the Blu-Ray has more bonus features on it than the regular deluxe edition. And finally, since day one, I have always noticed in one scene in particular (Marcy walking into the shower before her fate with an axe)...there was a black line in the film extending from the top to the bottom of the screen, and it was only in that one scene...it is now gone. Thank goodness! I thought it was my VHS for the longest time, then bought the first dvd release of this and that line was still there.

All and all I give this Deluxe Edition thumbs up and long overdue. The sound is great the extras are great. I am NOT looking forward to the so called ""remake"" of ""Friday the 13th"" coming out this coming Friday however. I have seen the previews of it and it seems to be ALL about Jason (mask and all) and not his mother, who did the killing in the original. Jason did NOT appear until ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" and in the previews he is also wearing his infamous hockey mask (which he did not acquire until part 3). It just looks like another sequel...NOT an offical ""remake"".

Hollywood once again remaking something that did not need to be remade. I hope it isn't as bad as that awful remake of ""Halloween"". But if the previews are any indication, then any fan of the original will more than likely detest it.

Why, I ask, can't Hollywood leave classics alone and try to come up with something new? Remaking and remaking and remaking...just redoing what somene else has already done. All those writers and producers and all they can do is re-do something. Shame.",1234051200,2,2026,4.354497354497354
237042,5,6300214087,"The movie transfer is perfect!  Perfect on my home theater.  In my opinion the best slasher film since Psycho.

The extras are ok, and yes its all stuff that we have heard before, but in my opinion, the following should help the people who cant decide whether to buy it or not:

1. You are a hardcore Friday the 13th film fan -  the gore isn't all that much, but just enough that any hardcore Friday the 13th fan will be in awe.

2.  You are a major fan of the Blu-Ray standard. -  Pretty much any blu-ray movie will be in your collection.

3.  You have a home theater setup with widescreen TV.  - WOW is it cool. I didn't even care about the extras, because the sound and picture was outstanding.  I could hear things that made me feel I was in the same room as the killer.

4.  You love all 80s horror films no matter what the title- if the horror movie ""The Prey""  is in your collection of movies, then this film will seem like Oscar material!  (Don't buy ""The Prey"" its an awful film. Im just making a comparison on a reason to buy this film)

If you don't fit that criteria, then in my opinion, this movie is not for you, or you will be happy enough with the version you already have.

237043,2,6300214087,"a few months ago when i heard paramount was releasing friday the 13th UNCUT for the first time in the US on blu-ray, i thought for the first time they had come to their senses and were going to finally give us a good release of this movie...man, was i wrong!!

first of all, let's look at this new revamped cover art.  it looks like it was made by a high school student using photoshop for the first time.  the arms are not proportionate to each other and the forearm of the one holding the knife looks deformed.  i don't know what's up with the squiggly line that makes up the right leg under 'uncut'--i think it was supposed to look like creases in the pants, but it doesn't.  it looks like bad photoshop clone-stamping.  basically, it's amateur work from a professional company.  i can't believe they wouldn't touch it up some before releasing it to the masses.

second, the movie is ZOOMED IN.  normally i wouldn't notice something like this, but they've cut out like half the shot from previous releases...'Friday the 13th' in the opening credits actually get's cropped off at the top.  i compared this to the previous paramount DVD release and Warner's uncut overseas DVD, and they both have a significant margin above the name.  you notice it other places too...when the couple at the beginning is flattening out the blanket on the floor--completely cut out of the shot, when you could see it before.  marcy's buttcrack when she's sitting on the bed in her panties with K.Bacon, completely cut out of the shot, when you could see it before....i always loved that buttcrack shot as a kid!!  now it's gone!!!!  if you grew up with this movie like i did, you'll definitely notice it throughout the movie...every shot is right up in the actors's faces when you knew that before you were seeing clear down past their shoulders.

as for extras, there's a few cool interviews, but most of it is recycled from previous releases.

'LOST TALES FROM CAMP BLOOD' is the worst piece of crap anyone's ever created!  it's a mini-movie (filmed recently, so in no way pertains to a release of the original F13th).  a couple is awakened by an intruder, so one at a time, they go downstairs and call people's names for about 5 minutes.  then they die gruesome deaths at the hand of some bald dude who looks nothing like jason.  all this while the score of the original movie plays in the background.  I HATED THIS.  apparently this is all paramount thinks a F13th movie is...they must have missed the fact that F13th required creativity, talent, a script, and good filmmaking.

all in all, the only thing they got right is they finally released it uncut.  everything else is wrong and a step down from previous releases.  the hi-def picture was okay but i was fairly unimpressed...probably because all i could think about was how weird it looks zoomed in like that.  if it were zoomed out to its true ratio, it would have made the picture look clearer and less grainy.

paramount is a disgrace to F13th.  they always disappoint me beyond my expectations.",1234051200,49,3042,4.625

****  Out of 5

Release Date- May 9th, 1980

Running Time- 95-Minutes

Rating- R

Screenplay- Victor Miller

Director- Sean Cunningham

Starring- Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Kevin Bacon, Laurie Bartram, Jeannine Taylor, Mark Nelson, Walt Gorney, Robbi Morgan, Peter Brouwer, Ari Lehman and Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees

Released in 1980 this low budget shocker would spawn what seems like a never ending amount of sequels and knockoff films. After the massive success of John Carpenter's Halloween, Sean Cunningham decided to make his own slasher flick, but calling Friday the 13th a Halloween knockoff is just wrong. While the basic structure of the movie is inspired by Halloween, Friday the 13th has more in common with the Giallo and some of the death scenes were clearly inspired by Mario Bava's Bay of Blood. Despite the reputation Friday the 13th has it actually is a very well done horror flick that takes way too much heat. I suppose the sequels and knockoff films are part of that reason and while Halloween is clearly the better picture, but if you dislike Friday the 13th for what it started you should also hate Halloween. Some people debate the status of Friday the 13th; some hail it as a classic and others don't. I'd say it's somewhere in the middle. As good as Friday the 13th is it is kind of hard to rate it as highly as say Frankenstein or Night of the Living Dead, but with that said in it's own right it is classic.

Friday the 13th is far better than its given credit for again a lot of people say it's a Halloween knockoff and is nothing more than a body count film. While I suppose Friday the 13th did sort of start the body count movie it still has a style all of its own and is actually quite suspenseful.

The screenplay by Victor Miller was actually fairly well written in general. Look Friday the 13th isn't Oscar worthy and when talking about the greatest of screenplays this won't get a mention, but with that said the script wasn't bad at all and has some creative moments and some fairly good characters, which is something these movies mostly lack. Each character has their own identity and while not the most developed characters they are more than just faceless victims. They are actually likeable and come across as real people. Later in the series and other slasher flicks the characters were nothing more than faceless victims, but Victor Miller gives each their own identity and does a decent job at developing them.

Sean Cunningham does a solid job with Friday the 13th; while I haven't really liked his other movies with Friday the 13th he crafts a movie that is quite suspenseful and scary at times. From the start of the movie until the end, Cunningham manages to get this great sense of dread. He's able to create this feeling of unease and at anytime you know something bad can happen. Like the movie being better than it gets credit for the same thing can be said about Sean Cunningham's directing. Unlike the sequels Friday the 13th actually moves at a slow, but steady pace and there is a long stretch without any murders, but in these scenes Cunningham sets up a dark and eerie tone and develops the characters. After this movie I can't really say I was into Cunningham's movies, but here with Friday the 13th he does an amazing job and crafts an excellent and scary movie.

The older I get the more of an appreciation I seem to gain for this movie. Again despite the reputation it has Friday the 13th is an excellent horror movie that is quite creepy with some good scares. The now clichd last scare was frightening, but now it's been done so much it's so expected. Like I stated before the characters were quite interesting and likable and each has their own identity. The performances were fairly good as well. All the actors were early in their careers so any problems are easily overlooked. This series became all about Jason and many people often forget about Mrs. Voorhees played by Betsy Palmer. It's like that scene in Scream when the killer asks who the killer was in Friday the 13th and Drew Barrymore's character replies with Jason. That's a very common mistake that even some fans make by accident. But Mrs. Voorhees was an excellent killer and deserves far more recognition.

Friday the 13th really has so much more going for it than people give it credit for and I cannot state that enough. The score by Harry Manfredini is excellent and the gore scenes by Tom Savini are some of his best and look quite real. Friday the 13th isn't the gore flick people claim it to be. Compared to movies like Zombi 2 and Maniac this movie is quite dry, but the gore scenes look real for the most part and the murders are simple, but highly effective. The sequels started the more over the top murder scenes, which were great, but in this one they were simple and by far the most effective.",1233878400,,4861,4.591695501730104
237046,3,6300214087,"This review is for the Blu-ray and NOT the actual film. I have a review for the movie as well just click on my reviews to see if you want to.

For the first time in the States Friday the 13th has been released uncut; due to that I'm sure a lot of fans are quite interested in this release, but the question is, is this edition worth the upgrade?

The uncut edition is only 10-seconds longer and the added gore isn't much. To be honest you'll hardly notice the difference with the exception of Kevin Bacon's death, which was awesome. Don't expect Lucio Fulci type gore out of the uncut version. It's only about a second or two longer in the death scenes and like I said odds are you'll hardly notice the difference between this and the R-rated cut.

But point is we finally have this movie uncut and while the added gore scenes aren't all that noticeable and they don't really make the movie any better it's still cool to finally have it released here in the States.

The Blu-ray release has the same exact features as the DVD Deluxe Edition. There are no Blu-ray exclusives nor are there any features not included on the DVD. The Blu-ray release for Friday the 13th is actually very good. When it comes to Paramount one can never know what to expect, but they did a fine job with the Blu-ray transfer. Seeing as this movie was made in 1980 obviously you won't get the full Blu-ray effect like you would with a more recent movie.

But regardless the print looks amazing, but still keeps its low budget charm. This is the best Friday the 13th has ever looked and probably as good as it ever will on home video (well until the next format that outdoes Blu-ray). The quality on the Blu-ray obviously is far better than the previous DVD releases. Some scenes in previous releases were very dark, which was also due to the lighting, but the print was dark and the BD keeps the lighting dark, but in other scenes that were tough to make out is now much better looking.

As for the new DVD Deluxe Edition I haven't seen it so I cannot comment on how much better the Blu-ray release is. Well obviously the BD will be better than the DVD, but based on what I have seen from movies from the 80s on Blu-ray, while better they aren't that much better. The DVD was also re-mastered in HD and again no doubt the BD will be better, but odds are it won't be that much better due to the age of the film the picture and colors will be sharper for sure, but it won't blow away the new DVD. If you plan to buy the uncut version I'd highly recommend the Blu-ray this is the best Friday the 13th has looked on home video; now onto the extras.

There's an audio commentary track with members of the cast and crew. All tracks were recorded separately none of the people involved are in the room together and it's all edited in.

All features are in HD unless otherwise noted.

FRIDAY THE 13TH REUNION- 16-Minutes (HD)

This was taken from a convention and was pretty good; look by this point with websites devoted to the series and books as well any information given fans already know, but it was a good feature. The panel includes Tom Savini, Ari Lehman, Victor Miller, Adrienne King, Betsy Palmer and Harry Manfredini

FRESH CUTS: NEW TALES FROM FRIDAY THE 13TH- 14-Minutes (HD)

More of the same standard interviews; Victor Miller actually recites word for word what he said at the Reunion feature. This was a good feature, but again this is stuff fans already know by now. Interviews are with Victor Miller, Ari Lehman, Robbi Morgan, Tom Savini and Harry Manfredini. In this feature Robbi Morgan who played Annie mentions being the first victim. Actually she was the 3rd victim.

THE MAN BEHIND THE LEGACY: SEAN CUNNINGHAM- 8-Minutes (HD)

This is a brief interview with Sean Cunningham and his son Noel briefly appears. This feature was alright, but again much of the same. Paramount was just a little too late on this edition.

LOST TALES FROM CAMP BLOOD- 7-Minutes (HD)

This is a short film by Andrew Ceperley; it was actually fairly good; part 2 is on the new Friday the 13th Part II DVD.

THE FRIDAY THE 13TH CHRONICLES

This feature is a carry over from the Crystal Lake to Manhattan DVD set.

SECRETS GALORE BEHIND THE GORE

Another carry over from Crystal Lake to Manhattan

THEATRICAL TRAILER (HD)

Overall the new Blu-ray/DVD is a solid release, but sadly too little too late as most fans probably already know all the stuff that was stated and if you have the Crystal Lake to Manhattan set all the new features are pretty much covered there. Like I said this was a good release, but had it been released a few years ago it would have been great. This comes recommended to Friday the 13th fans just don't expect to learn anything new.",1233878400,2,4725,4.444444444444445
237104,4,6300214087,"Only 10 seconds of extra footage, says so right on the box.

And Manfredini's score really sounds crisp and just as jolting as ever.

Fans looking for any superfluous deleted scenes will not find that here, the ""uncut"" reference merely refers to 10 seconds of footage excised by the MPAA that was determined too gory for an 80's viewing audience.  Restored here, many viewers probably can't discern the difference.  But knowledgeable fans who want their ""Friday"" to be whole and complete will be pleased.

I highly recommend it based on the feature alone, as I have yet to delve into the extras.  All in all, a well-done offering.",1233792000,3,822,6.043103448275862
237106,5,6300214087,"Okay, I'm not going to review the actual film or give a plot synopsis for this one.  If you're old enough to watch cable or type on the internet, then you've probably seen this one or at least heard about it.

This is a review of the latest release from Paramount(who conveniently sold New Line the Jason name and character but retained the title Friday The 13th for their much derided dirty little money making secret of a film).  Lucky for them that horror is popular again, about as popular as it was way back in the late 70's and throughout the 80's.  It always annoys me just a little bit to know that a company that treated these films with such disdain and embarassment has no problems cashing in on them and re-releasing them on DVD constantly.  If one of their 'high-brow' pictures in the 80's tanked then they'd shoot one of these Friday flicks out fast and cheap, and would get a guranteed profit, and then send that profit to another high-brow picture and cross their fingers.  I get it.  Capitalism.  Just irks me ever so slightly.  Okay, enough of that ranting....

The picture looks great, no better than the box set's, but still good all the same.  The price is right, and the main reason I picked this baby up was for the commentary track(the best special feature for films on any format--EVER--So much so, that I remember buying a Scream deluxe VHS set just so I could get a second tape with Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson talking over the film on it.)  This commentary track has bits from the writer, 'last girl' actress, Cunnigham and others.  Its fun and loaded with anecdotes, and some helpful hints for all you future independent filmmakers out there.  The special features beyond that are decent.  The problem with them is that we've heard a lot of it before in the previously released From Crystal Lake to Manhattan set,and the recently released His Name Was Jason documentary.  There's also a short film called Lost Tales from Crystal Lake part I.  Which is a 6 minute short film of a Jason-like killer stalking a couple in their home???  It's well done, but you'll never watch it again.

Finally, this release is uncut.  For this particular installment that doesn't really amount to much.  I think in total 11 seconds of gore was cut from this film out of 45.  Hardcore fans will notice the difference, and they will be very pleased, but for casual fans it really won't seem like a big deal.  Hell, with the levels of violence in horror films today this one is totally tame.  Extremely fun, but tame.  Yes, we finally get longer shots of Betsy Palmers headless body(with Tom Savini's assistant's hands), blood flowing from hitchhiker girls neck, girl sliding down wall with axe imbedded in head, and Kevin Bacon's extended death---which is the best of the extenssions and has the most impact in general.

So, if you have the box set, or just own the original no-frills disc, it's still worth getting for the fun commentary and the unrated cut of the film.  The film is still fun.  Never was that scary.  Will defiantely put you in a nostalgic mood and the commentary will feel like you're hanging out with some old friends having a beer and laughing about that sick little movie you all saw together.

PS:The Friday films that desperately need director's cuts would definately be parts 6,7, and 8!  I've seen the unrated footage for 6 and 7, in raw form, on the Friday box set, so I'm going to hope they clean the cuts up and reinstate them in a future release.  Hopefully, the deleted scenes can be cleaned up better than the ones featured in My Bloody Valentine Unrated, though I don't mind and understand why a studio wouldn't put the expense into a slasher film that's more of a cult thing than a mainstay, but Friday films are known by even people who haven't seen them.  Hell, most folks who hate, loathe, and use them as excuses for the level of juvenile violence and serial killings haven't even seen them.

While the re-inserted scenes only really amount to nothing more than a few seconds of deleted gore effects, it's nice to finally have the original Friday the 13th in all its uncut glory.  There's a decent assortment of extras included on the DVD as well, including an interesting commentary from Sean S. Cunningham and some nice featurettes and recollections on what the film meant then and now.  Like it or not, Friday the 13th owns a place in horror history that has and will stand the test of time, and finally having it here in its uncut form makes that factoid all the more true.

237110,5,6300214087,"In 1957, a young boy named Jason Voorhees drowned in Camp Crystal Lake then a year later some camp counslors were horribly murdered mysteriously. Now in 1979, the camp is about to reopen thanks to a new owner Steve (Peter Brouwer) with counselors but suddenly a mysterious killer is murder each of them, one by bloody one until one survives to reveal who the true killer is.

Co-starring Kevin Bacon, Adrienne King, Laurie Bartham, Mark Nelson, Robbin Morgan, Harry Crosby and Betsy Palmer. This is a unique and stylish slasher shocker that started off as an idea by Victor Miller based off campfire legends including the legend of Cropsy the killer which was later made as ""The Burning"" and influenced by films by ""Halloween"" and ""Psycho"", Sean S. Cunningham who produced the 1972 sleaze-feast ""Last House on The Left"" produced and directed the project to make it low budget. Made in 1979 then finished in 1980,it opened up on june 13th 1980 distributed by Paramount Pictures to become one of the highest grossing movies at the box-office that year despite bad reviews including Roger Ebert who declared it nothing but a ""Halloween"" rip-off. What makes the movie so effective is the ""Psycho""-esque score by Harry Manfredini and of course the memorable gore effects by Tom Savini which shocked the daylights out of people when it first came out yet they are still effective. Although Jason isn't the true killer in this movie, even though he does appear in a couple of sequences and doesn't become the villain until the sequels, the film offers scares and shocks from beginning to end as it spawned sequels, imitators, a slew of trick or treaters with Jason costumes and a remake in the works, it even paved way for ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and other slasher movies of the 80's.

This Blu-Ray brings us for the first time in the U.S. the uncut unrated version with more violent footage that was toned down to avoid an ""X"" rating originally. It offers great picture and sound quality in the best high definition possible with great extras like interviews, featurettes, a reunion at a horror convention, ""Tales from Camp Blood part 1"" Short film, audio commentary and theatrical trailer.",1233705600,2,2188,4.847593582887701

And to me, a commentary isn't from switching to different people at different locations of the world...it's a bunch of people in the SAME room - feeding off of each other.  There is nothing special about this release except for the re-mastering.  The segment of the Friday reunion was decent but could have been longer.
The uncut is nothing we haven't seen before.  What about the Brenda footage that was rumored of being in the film at the archery range?  This is a hack job of a re-release.

Only reason I give it 3 stars is because they did remaster all three in High Definition and gave them all 5.1 sound. worth buying for that but blu ray format is the best way to go on this one because the picture is stunning on it.

UPDATE: There are more death scenes cut. Brenda is slung to the archery board by an arrow from Mrs Vorhees. (if it wasn't cut you can see a shadow of vorhees aiming towards her about to shoot as well as brenda flown to the board and shes hung there helplessly.

Claudette which was the first girl to be killed had her neck cut which you can see proof of that from a photo from a book titled (crystal lake memories) which amazon has.

 Steve Christy is also more graphic and he is suppose to fall to the ground ""white screen"".

 Also mrs vorhees shadow appears around Bill like brendas death only she shoots him in the eye and he falls to the side and ""white screen"" again shows after...

Some are great works of Art due to some brilliant and painstaking artistry while others get there by capturing a certain moment in time and embodying a certain group of elements that (somehow) speaks to whole generations - making them popular phenomenons beyond any discussion. FRIDAY THE 13TH is one of those films. It helped define the slasher genre. Simple as that. It belongs in a group of other very important films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HALLOWEEN/dp/B000RIWAVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HALLOWEEN</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-NIGHTMARE-ON-ELM-STREET/dp/0780626966/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-TEXAS-CHAINSAW-MASSACRE/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE</a>.

But if it seems lame it is just because we are not looking it closely enough.

FRIDAY THE 13TH (like its peers) are not about gore. They are about beautiful America gone wrong. They are about beautiful innocent teens with squeaky clean smiles being thrown into the darkness, waste, murder and destruction... by an axe straight on the face or a knife erupting from (beautiful) Kevin Bacon's throat. Behind nice towns, nice people and all the cumbayas lie ugly things.

I was a child when I saw FRIDAY THE 13TH on VHS in the early eighties... and the thing that caught my fascination was its atmosphere of isolation, helplessness and loneliness on those victims. They never knew what hit them.

Today, this is all a big banality and horror films want to make each victim (and the viewer) suffer endlessly as contrived master-murderers make each scene a contrived extravaganza in itself. But in masterpieces like FRIDAY THE 13TH, the (very few) murder set pieces (or shocks if you wanna call it that way) are so carefully controlled and interact so well with atmosphere and mood that they get potent and potent the closer you look. These films are the true last heirs of Hitchcock's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PSYCHO/dp/B001CC7PP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PSYCHO</a>.

237177,5,6300214087,"2009 Is the year of jason's resurrection. Jason was born in friday the 13th in 1946, drowned at the tender age of 11 in friday the 13th in 1957 and his death at crystal lake created the biggest horror franchise ever.
 His mother pamela murdered the two teens in 1958 and 20 years later steve christie re-opened the camp blood and the FRIDAY THE 13TH legend films begun.
 To clear things little jason drowned at crystal lake but when his mother be-headed at the end of part 1 he came back for revenge.
 Now, how he came back it was not explained until part 9 JGTH was released in 1993 telling us that a devil creature entered jason's body that's why jason was invinsible in the first 8 films. Weird thing is he was presented more vulnerable in the first 4 films but still the demon gave him enough strength and power to surpass death as we saw clearly in part 4 when he was resurrected in the hospital where he was taken assumed he was dead.
 At the end of part 4 little tommy jarvis killed him AGAIN and jason was burried BUT the demon kept him alive although he was rotten in his grave and when tommy jarvis (now older) opened his grave in part 6 to burn jason's corpse a lightning resurrected the body of jason which was kept ""alive"" by the demon and we were introduced to the zombie-jason monster who was kept alive at the bottom of the lake at the end of every F13 sequel from part 6 to part 8 until finally writer, director rob hedden decided to END jason once and for all by transforming him in to a little boy at the end of part 8 JTM. Once again jason drowned this time in the sewers of NY and his evil being was destroyed by toxic waste (if that's possible) and we were witnessed little jason's redemption from evil. Yet in the beggining of JGTH we saw a brand new jason stalking a girl at crystal lake. What have happened was the demon which escaped jason's flaming body in the sewers of NY entered another human body and a new jason was born (as we saw this happenning many times in part 9, and if we ignore the bull that the devil could create a new jason only through a voorhees family member). This is the only logical way to connect part 8 with part 9 if we assume that jason became little jason at the end of part 8. At the end of part 9 jason went to hell, then he battled with freddy crueger and then (in time order) went to...space where he FINALLY transformed to ubber jason in earth 2. Jason as we knew him was a thing of the past but the series are not over yet as we have a new film on the way.
 This time is a restart of the series and this is a good thing but first let me say this. It would be great to end the old series with no plot holes and i mean, WE KNOW S$IT OF WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN FvJ and JX. At the end of FvJ jason went out of the lake holding freddy's head in his hand and next in part 10 we find him being captured at crystal lake sometime in the future SO WHAT WE NEED IS ONE MORE F13 SEQUEL WHICH WILL CONNECT FVJ WITH JX AND THEN MOVE ON TO A NEW F13 SERIES.
 I hope the people who are involved with the new F13 flick to read this review and to hear what the fans are asking for their beloved franchise.
 Friday the 13th spawned 12 films so far grossing more than $500 million worldwide, selling millions of dvd's and gaining more millions from rental sales.
 Jason is an icon horror who will never die and he's the best known boogeyman in the world. Only freddy and myers can be compared with him.
 JASON IS THE KING OF ALL BOOGEYMEN AND PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED WITH HIS MOVIES SHOULD RESPECT JASON AND THE FANS AND GIVE US A PROPER ENDING TO THE OLD SERIES AND A DECENT NEW ALTERNATIVE F13 SERIES.

237182,5,6300214087,"The original Friday the 13th is not the first, the most original, or the best slasher film ever made, but it is arguably the most influential.  You almost have to take off one of your socks to count all of the sequels (and impending remake) this slasher granddaddy has spawned, and I daresay the majority of slasher films littering the genre in all the years since were constructed on the generic and simple framework of the Friday the 13th formula.  Critics are still foaming at the mouth in indignation over this film all these years later, so you know it did something right.  Of course, by today's standards Friday the 13th registers low (if at all) on the fright meter and really isn't all that gory, but no one can dispute the fact that this film set the stage for innumerable bloody slasher films to come.

Cunningham (who had already cut his horror chops on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-House-on-the-Left/dp/B000068IEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last House on the Left</a>) wanted to try his hand at creating a scary slasher film of his own.  Cunningham did not have a big studio backing him, so he had to make this an independent, low-budget (barely more than half a million dollars) project.  With almost all of the action taking place at  Camp Crystal Lake, all Cunningham had to do was to find a viable old campsite, populate it with unknown actors (one of which, Kevin Bacon, went on to become a household name), kill his characters in compellingly different yet simple ways, and smack an ending on top of it.  In some ways, it sounds like an almost haphazard project.  The controversial gotcha scene near the very end, for example, was never in the original script - instead, it was added late in the game on the advice of special effects makeup guru Tom Savini, who had just seen Carrie.  That is only one of several obvious influences worked into the film - even the famous Jason music leaves a trail of musical crumbs back to the shark music in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0008KLVG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition)</a>.  Despite of everything, though, Paramount liked the final product, bought up the distribution rights, and the film hit box office gold.  The rest is horror - and cinema - history.

As we all know by now, little Jason Voorhees drowned in 1957 while the counselors who should have been watching him were busy having sex.  A year later, two counselors at the camp were brutally murdered (as they were getting it on, of course), with the murderer never being caught.  That was more than Camp Crystal Lake could endure, and it soon closed its cabin doors for good.  The residents of Crystal Lake know to stay away from the lake and ""Camp Blood,"" but Steve Christy has decided he's going to open the place back up.  He's supposedly been working to get the place ready for a year, but it's still a run-down dump.  He's hired all of the requisite randy teens to serve as counselors/murder victims (anybody who plays strip Monopoly out in the middle of the woods is practically begging to be eviscerated by a mad killer), though, so everything is in place for good, old-fashioned bloodbath.  All we need is a killer.

The one thing I've always admired most about the slayings in the Friday the 13th movies is the sheer efficiency of them all.  Even at the beginning, before Jason himself ever lifted his first machete, the killer is all about getting the job done and going on to the next victim.  That's not to say the murders aren't stylish and impressive, though.  I just wish they would have been a lot gorier.  Clearly, this film does have a few problems and doesn't deserve five stars on its own merits.  When you figure in the immense influence this film has had on the horror movie genre and pop culture itself, though, I think it rightly deserves that fifth star.

If you've never seen the original Friday the 13th, you need to see it - especially if you've watched several of the sequels.  After all, an incorrect answer to the question of who did the killings in the original Friday the 13th film will get you banned from all horror fan clubs for life.",1225065600,6,4531,5.046979865771812

237223,4,6300214087,"I first saw this movie when I was in seventh grade. I'll have to admit that I watched all of the Friday the 13th movies in order and rented them all from my local video store. I enjoyed all of them very much. After I saw the first I had to see more.

I had seen this movie again about ten years ago and I had recently seen it again a few months ago. My views have changed a little bit about the movie over the years.

I found the movie captivating when I saw it when I was 13. Ten years ago I was still excited with the movie even though I knew who the killer was. The kill scenes which are the norm now were innovative back when the movie was first released. The kills that happened weren't exactly new in movies at that time but it was the first time that they happened in such a popular horror movie and in that severity.

After seeing this when I was younger I was amazed by what I saw. It held my attention throughout the whole movie wondering who the killer was picking off people off one by one. I liked the camp setting and enjoyed claustrophobic feel that the surrounding woods gave the movie.

Back when I first saw this movie it was a mystery as to who the slasher was and why they were doing what they were doing. The person was only shown from the waist down mostly.

Ten years ago I was aware of who the killer was in the movie but I was still into the whole friday the 13th movies. Seeing it again brought me back to my youth.

Seeing the movie again a few months ago gave me a slightly different perspective on the film. I was totally aware of who the killer was and that made me slightly impatient towards the final act of the movie. I also was dissapointed by the darkness which appeared during the chase scenes at night. I sometimes had trouble following the action and had to occasionally strain my eyes to see it. I also found some parts of the movie to drag a little while watching it. But overall I found the movie to be very good. And again I can't forget to mention those kills. These were in the early days of 80's horror before the MPAA got strict with the killing that was shown and how long the shots lingered on the dead bodies which could be cut by seconds which reduced the gore shown.

When the uncut version of this movie does become available there should be restored footage and added gore. It may only result in a few extra seconds to some kill scenes it will still be worth it to see the movie in its entirety.",1223078400,6,2448,4.130252100840337

The casting is strong.  The acting,  thus,  is as strong as any film produced today.  The line deliveries are realistic and the inflections are perfect.  Betsy Palmer and Adrienne King do carry this film,  but each actor plays a great role in the overall greatness of the 90 minutes.

The musical score,  although I'm not usually fond of overbearing music in film,  works here.  The sounds created become characters in themselves.  They infuse themselves within the very fabric of the picture.

Savini does a great job with the make-up/effects.  The characters are just out of reach to the viewer,  making the revenge murders not as horrifying.  The viewer is mesmerized by the effect,  all at the same time the brain isn't believing an effect is playing,  it's real.  Again,  the effects become characters in the film as well.  Each actor is remembered by their demise.

I don't think it's far reaching to say that this is one of the best films ever produced.  The cinematography, direction, casting, effects, score and all the members who made this film did a great job.

237282,4,6300214087,"Many reviewers reject ""Friday the 13th"" as a mere teenage sex and gore slasher trash flick of the 80s.  True, it does have some of the flaws of the genre.  But I think it has enough good qualities to raise it above most movies of its time and genre.  First, the heroine in danger is someone we care about.  A group of young people are reopening a summer camp.  They care about young people.  OK, they smoke dope and have sex.  But at least most of the time they are trying to do something worthwhile.  The dialogue is fairly hip and funny.  And the killings are suspenseful without being overly sloppy.  But what really make this flick a winner is the killer, played by Betsy Palmer.  For older viewers like me, Ms. Palmer brings a real pressence to this movie.  She was the quintessential attractive, wholesome, upper middleclass lady of the 50s.  Those old enough will remember her on popular panel TV shows of the 50s.  So what? you might say.  This is what.  Ms. Palmer versus the free spirit kids is more than the generation gap; it is an ax in your head war.  The son of the character she plays was drowned in the lake at the camp because of the negligence of the conselors.  And she has come back for revenge.  I think that what sets apart successful thrillers from others is the revelation that someone the audience and the characters at risk think is good and safe turns out to be the twisted killer.  This revelation is made in a chilling, threatening speach.  You might remember George Brent in ""The Spiral Staircase.""  Nobody does it better than Betsy Palmer who goes from Betty Crocker to Lady Mcbeth.  Finally, the heroine does survive, showing her true grit.  But she is so stunned by the evil she has encountered, that she is a psychological basket case.  So maybe Ms. Betsy is the real winner.  And so is this flick.",1212019200,3,1833,4.462235649546828

Before the Blair Witch was haunting the woods, before the werewolves of Dog Soldiers were stomping around in the dark, before countless other copy-cat wannabes, there was the menacing killer of Friday the 13th.

To be sure, John Carpenter hit the nail on the head a few years prior with the classic Halloween, but Friday the 13th also opened audience's eyes to a new breed of horror movie - the gory serial killing scream-fest.

For those in the know, Jason doesn't make an appearance until Part 2, but his legacy is revealed in fine family fashion here.  The simple plot entails a small boy who drowns at a summer camp while the counselors are busy getting busy.  Needless to say, his mom is rather pissed and unforgiving, and Jason just might not be dead...

The killings, for early 80's, are quite inventive - an ax through the head, an arrow through the neck, and lots of fun at the archery range are just a few of the treats in store.  Effects were good because the master Tom Savini was just getting his shoes muddy and honing his skills. Love it.

Kevin Bacon, for those of you who were born under a rock, makes his screen debut here, rivaling Johnny Depp's nasty demise in A Nightmare on Elm Street.

The ending is one of those great surprises in film. If you didn't gasp or scream the first time you saw it, you're lying.

The original brought novel ways of killing and presenting the killings to the screen.  Like when the girl is in the cabin standing close to the window.

237362,3,6300214087,"Though nominated for its share of Razzies back in the day, Friday the 13th is unquestionably a significant film, for better or worse.  On the good side, Friday the 13th helped to bring horror to the forefront again.  On the bad side, Friday the 13th signaled the beginning of a shameless marketing effort based on exploitation.  It is the quintessential slasher film and I can't say whether that is a wholly bad or a wholly good thing to be.  It is an incredibly derivative film that borrows from many of the things that highlighted horror classics from the 1970s.  The obvious borrowing from Halloween and Black Christmas is there, but the way it reinforced previously established clichs is absolutely groundbreaking due to the film's massive popularity.  Even the great scary ending with Jason leaping from the water was a formula borrowed from Brian De Palma's Carrie, and it was repeatedly used again and again thereafter...even in Friday the 13th's many sequels.

In 1958, two sexed-up camp counselors (the standard victim in these films) are murdered.  The film forwards to 1980, the camp has a curse and we are given more than our fair share of foreshadowing.  A little boy drowned in Crystal Lake a year earlier.  That little boy is Jason and as we all know by now, the killer is his vengeful mother.  After the plot introduction phase we are introduced to a group of shallow camp counselor characters.  They are gradually murdered in many different gruesome ways by the then unknown assailant.  Kevin Bacon plays one of the counselors in an early role.  Eventually we find out that the killer is Pamela Voorhees (played by a less than enthusiastic but still professional Betsy Palmer) and the surviving counselor Alice cuts her head off.  As Alice waits in the lake in a canoe for help to arrive, the decaying body of a little boy Jason Voorhees jumps out of the lake to pull her into the water.  She is seen soon after in the hospital and asks the policeman ""The boy...is he dead too?""  The policeman responds and indicates that they found no boy.

As silly as this movie is, it certainly has a classic scary moment when Jason jumps out of the lake.  It is the scariest single moment in this long series of movies and one of the greatest jump scares of all time.  I'm too cynical to credit this movie for its success outside of its cultural impact.  It is a phenomenon and a standard setter, but it is also a very flawed movie that unfortunately set standards for many more flawed imitators that would follow.  It is hard to properly learn from a film that has nothing to teach.",1185321600,2,2588,4.654185022026431

The idea of someone killing you in your dreams? That's scary. Jason was, as far as I could tell, just another slasher. I was never quite sure what distinguished him from say, Michael Myers, or a million other slasher movies.

I also knew, like any child of the 80s, the basic storyline. As I imagine you do. Let's try a simple test. My guess is that even if you haven't seen the movie, you already know that:

*Jason's mother, not Jason himself, is the killer in the first movie

* It takes place on a campground, where Jason's mother is killing off the camp counselors one by one

* Kevin Bacon has a minor part in this movie before he became famous.

* It has low production values, and is pretty tame by today's standards

How did I do? And if you already know all that, no reason to sit through the actual movie, right?

Man, does this movie represent 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back again, or what? Forget all the moral reasons for or against watching these kind of slasher flicks, you've got to have an attention span of steel to even think about getting through this movie.

There are members of the community who are aware of evil plottings being aimed at Camp Crystal Lake and its denizens such as a truck driver and a local lunatic named ""Crazy Ralph."" Camp Crystal Lake opens up and it turns out that just about everyone who shows up, both counselors and campers alike, are nothing but a bunch of perverts who apparently deserve being slaughtered at the hands of a demented maniac.

Unlike almost all of the pre-1980 horror movies, Friday the 13th and the slasher flick sub-genre that it spawned is not with the victims.

237418,5,6300214087,"There is so much more to this movie that anyone gives it credit for. When you mention Friday the 13th, many people either dismiss it for being ""just a slasher flick"" or a ""Halloween rip-off."" Most people do not see the artistic value in Friday the 13th because they simply do not expect it to be in this kind of movie or do not want to acknowledge it, as a result of already having their closed (typical critic know it all) minds made up.

First off, Friday the 13th is not a Halloween rip-off. When Carpenter's equally classic Halloween generated top box office revenue in 1978 and 1979, many eyebrows raised within the film industry. Among those were the brows of a few people in particular. Sean (director) Cunningham, Victor (credited writer) Miller, Ron (unaccredited writer) Kurz, Steve (producer) Miner, and Georgetown (independent film production company) Productions all wanted in on the profit made by the Halloween. The only sensible thing they could think of doing was to produce a similar product, which became Friday the 13th.

Sean wanted to make the same kind of money that John made, but he knew he would have to make his film a little different. Instead of just having a walking masked madman on the loose, he and Victor came up with a story that is quite brilliant. Sure, certain scenes in Friday the 13th may have been taken from Halloween, but you can say the same thing about Halloween taking some scenes from Psycho. Friday the 13th, whether it was on purpose or not, utilized a couple of really good themes in their story telling, beyond the typical moral theme that everyone associates with these movies like sex leads to death.

The first theme that Friday the 13th throws in your face is the idea of isolated mass hysteria. Camp Crystal Lake and the town of Crystal Lake are haunted. They are not haunted by ghosts and goblins, but by unsuppressed dark memories of a little boy drowning and a string of unsolved murders among other things, in which all have to do with Camp Crystal Lake. Every person in town believes that there is a ""Death Curse"" upon the camp, and they refer to the place as ""Camp Blood."" When Annie walks into the restaurant and asks some people how she can get to Camp Crystal Lake, they all look at her and two people try to warn her to stay away from the place. They say the place is jinxed and has a death curse.

Psychology is only a little more then 100 years old, but we know that parents have a strong ""connection"" to their child even after the umbilical chord is severed. For a parent to have to burry their own child is probably the most devastating thing that can happen in their life. Mrs. Voorhees looses her son to a tragedy and little by little she snaps. She tries to give him life by giving him a voice at one point (just like Norman Bates did for his mother in Psycho), and that voice tells her to murder those responsible for her son's death.

Of course for the horror fan there is enough blood and murder to please. All in all Friday the 13th is a powerful tragic but frightening story of love, loss, superstition, and murder with an ending that is sure to make one jump (no pun intended) right out of one's seat. Also, not revealing the murderer until the end makes the film more suspenseful then showing the murderer in the opening sequence like Halloween did.",1165708800,50,3329,4.523255813953488

?huh? The only scenes that were all that gory were Jack and Marcie's death scenes. They weren't even that bad either. Obviously whoever thought this movie was violent needs to check out some of the later Friday the 13th films. Better yet, the Saw and Texas Chainsaw Massacre series.

To be perfectly honest, the very first Friday the 13th movie doesn't spark the same frightening reaction that the sequels do.  But that doesn't mean the movie is bad, or even weak.  It just means it was the very beginning, and you know, the beginning of something almost ALWAYS means that kinks need to be worked out.  The biggest problem with the original Friday the 13th is that you barely see any true violence.  By true I mean, actually SEEING a death happen before your eyes.  It doesn't happen in the original.  But you can't expect a true masterpiece IMMEDIATELY.  Sequels are truly a lifesaver.

Many similar hack and slash movies have been released over the years and those movies should pay respect to the original Friday the 13th.

I don't even need to tell you what the movie is about.  Whether you've avoided the movie because horror stories frighten you, or because you're just not a movie person... believe me, you've seen at least ONE Friday the 13th movie in your time.  Somewhere, somehow, it happened.

The first Friday the 13th may be weak but denying its influence would be crazy.  It's a 5-star movie.",1160697600,2,1551,4.656826568265683

Anyway ""Friday the 13th"" is my best film ever and in my top 10 of the bests films took the 1st place! The other 9 places are : ""Halloween"", ""Jaws"" , ""the shining"" , ""misery"" , ""The texas chainsaw massacre"", ""sleepaway camp"" , ""the howling"", ""psycho"" and ""zero boys"" from Nikos Mastorakis!",1160697600,5,465,4.235955056179775
237422,2,6300214087,"Fair enough this movie is now 26 years old, but I have no idea how it could of spawned so many sequels to be perfectly honest. I watched this for the very first time last week and I was painfully disapointed because I love a good old horror flick. You don't really get to see alot of gore in this movie, everyone just mysteriously vanishes and then turns up dead in a ""ghost train"" type manner, the type of ghost train that's in the lamest amusement park one could imagine. By ghost train I mean, dead bodies just pop out from nowhere in the most random of fashions. *Spoiler to follow* One problem I had is that the Mother was incapable of taking down a small fumbling blonde girl towards the end but had no problem killing the larger males of the group. The arrow thru the eye was a cool touch, but it would of been good to actually see it!

To help pave the way for future horror flicks this is a decent start, but the storyline is really bad lol",1160697600,,949,4.185792349726776
237481,3,6300214087,"I was actually born on Friday 13th. So over the years I've enjoyed delighting people by telling them I was born on Friday 13th. I've got many different reactions, one being that someone told me the bad luck was reversed. The most extreme reaction I've ever had was my history teacher at high school. I did really well in his class, he was a brilliant teacher, and he wanted me to continue taking history (we had to choose between history or geography) - until I told him I was born on Friday 13th. This is the guy who used to stay off school on Friday 13th. His phobia of anything Friday 13th was so severe that in quizzes, he used to miss out the number 13, and go straight from question 12, to question 14. Hello Mr Duncan.

I've actually seen these films in the wrong order. I hadn't previously seen either the Friday 13th movies or the Nightmare On Elm Street movies when I saw the Freddy vs Jason movie. I know of both movies of course (and my boyfriend collects the dolls of Jason - sorry action figurines!) and he dressed up as Jason once for Halloween. But that was about it. I think I've seen Jason X, but it's a couple of years ago now.

The first Friday 13th movie will not give you nightmares, or will make you hide behind the couch. I sat there waiting to be scared. I wasn't. My boyfriend did have nightmares that night, but I don't think it was caused by this somehow. It's very by-the-numbers horror. And it's so very eighties, it's embarrassing. But what I did like was the way you never actually saw Jason. You saw someone's feet or a hand holding a knife, but never the iconic figure. And then it seemed to be portraying Pamela Voorhees as the killer towards the end of the film - in my opinion anyway. He does appear right at the very end as a surprise for the audience, and certainly got a reaction then as you're not expecting it. Much like the finale of Freddy vs Jason I suppose.

There's no big names in this film - or so I thought until I went on IMDB, and discovered that Kevin Bacon's lookalike in this was actually ... Kevin Bacon. Hehe. I sat throughout the film thinking ""That guy really looks like Kevin Bacon"", only to discover it actually was!

There's no inventive killings in this, they come later in the franchise. I'm actually surprised the first movie spawned such a franchise, as to me, it wasn't that great. But then again, I am watching it the 21st century. I suppose it would have been scarier upon it's original release.

Betsy Palmer is the actress who plays Pamela Voorhees and one critic was so angry at her role in the movie (which had angered many of her fans), that he published her address in his magazine, and encouraged people to write her and protest her. He published the wrong address.

Friday 13th is an alright film, I wouldn't really call it a horror movie as such, maybe back in the day, but certainly not now. Hopefully the rest of the movies in the franchise is better.",1160352000,,2931,4.368807339449542
237482,4,6300214087,"I was working in a cinema in 1980 when this film was first released, No one expected it to take a light and it opened in one of the complex's smallest screens. Big mistake. From day one queues formed for this film and many wannabe punters were somewhat peeved for being turned away. Those who got in though experienced a genuinely scary horror film and it remains one of the best audience participation films that I have ever seen. Throughout the film, the suspense runs along and builds up to a crescendo prior to each slaying or to a false moment of fear.

The ending, however is something else. Sure it ain't exactly original but boy is it effective. I have never seen an audience scream so loudly and in total unison, and have some people visibly shaken and in tears sometimes afterwards.... Night after night, the result was the same and Friday The 13th became one of the 'sleepers' of 1980. Watch out too for a young Kevin Bacon as one of the teens in peril.

The passage of time has seen it take its place in the pantheon of really scary horror films and deservedly so. If you have not yet seen this film, then give it a go. Enjoy and be prepared to be scared.",1158796800,82,1167,4.348623853211009

237486,3,6300214087,"Well, I wasn't born an English Major. And in younger days, I was bitten by the Friday the 13th bug pretty bad. Most of my peers and friends felt this 1st chapter was the best, and they did have 2 things on their side. (1) This was of course the one that started it all. And (2), with the possible exception of Part 5, this was the most plausible one.

The story begins (many years ago) when 2 camp counselors were murdered. (If you are reading this, you probably already know that Jason is NOT the culprit in this 1st chapter. But I'll respect those who haven't seen it yet.) Well, the owner (Steve) decides so many years later to risk reopening the camp. Early on, we meet Crazy Ralph who spreads his prophecy of doom. We also learn that a boy drowned in 1957. We then meet the group of counselors who are trying to get the camp ready. The counselors are likable despite their underdeveloped characters. (Though Ned is kind of a likable practical joker who offers some comical touches.) There is also some romance between the counselors that is fairly well written. (Especially Marcy's telling of her 'shower dreams.')

Later, we meet Crazy Ralph a 2nd time who warns the counselors that they are doomed if they don't leave. In his 1st scene, Crazy Ralph seemed to justify his name. But somehow, we get the impression in his 2nd scene, that we should listen to him. To be sure, we know that Annie was killed. But there is some interesting lighting and use of piano tones that makes us take him just a bit more seriously now. (Even if the counselors don't.)

Despite the somewhat shallow dialogue, the director manages to keep our attention. Some scenes like the night falling over the camp are especially well done. The counselors start getting killed, but we don't know who is doing it. The director seems to show some discretion in not using excess blood. Moving on, the director seems to avoid making the killings the only route of horror. 2 of the counselors know that something isn't right, and they try to flee, but to no avail.

Eventually, only Alice is left, and she realizes that all her friends have been killed. The director seems to underline that fear of death can be worse than death itself. When the murderer is revealed, the movie is not only tied together, but the grounds for the sequels are set. Interestingly, sometimes recognition is more scary than violence. In the midst of terror, the director adds some beauty to this horror movie. Overall, it's a pretty good horror movie.",1151366400,,2500,4.586129753914989
237487,4,6300214087,"Let us forget, for just a moment, the over-abundance of sequels that this film has generated in over 20 years and go back to the very beginning...

The year was 1980 and horror movies were more popular than ever, partly because John Carpenter had re-generated them with his smash indie hit, HALLOWEEN.  1980 saw the release of such titles as THE FOG, THE CHANGELING, DON'T GO IN THE HOUSE, BLOOD BEACH, THE CHILDREN and THE SHINING.  The original FRIDAY THE 13TH was actually released on Friday May 13, 1980.  Other than borrowing the idea of using an actual infamous day on the calander (a-la Halloween), it was, at the time, an original and very creepy idea for a horror story.

Camp Crystal Lake is a camp that's cursed; a boy drowns in 1957, two counselors are killed in 1958, a bunch of fires, poisoned well water, etc.  Attempting to re-open in present-day 1980, a group of counselors (look for a very young Kevin Bacon as one of the victims) getting the camp ready are mysteriously and terrifyingly mudered by an unknown killer.  By the time the film is down to one counselor, we are reintroduced to the drowning of 1957; a little, deformed boy named Jason, whose mother, still psychotically-disturbed from his death, is responsible for the murders.  She is beheaded by the surviving counselor, but we learn that Jason may still be alive in the lake that he drowned in; waiting for the chance to kill again.

And thus, the horror really begins; too many damn sequels!  But like the ROCKY franchise, it all began with an original concept, still worth viewing today.",1150070400,5,1571,4.700729927007299
237488,5,6300214087,"This movie is boring at times, but definitly old school horror from the  Age Of Gore Horror 1978-1983. Betsy Palmer plays a brilliant manical Pamela Voorheels. From the opening scene taking place in 1958 Camp Crystal Lake, Friday The 13th Pt. 1 at times is a scary riveting ride. The scene were actress Robbie Morgan gets her throat slashed on the way to the camp is very graphic for a movie of its time. Even today it still looks so damn real. Thanks to the efforts of special effects wizard Tom Savini. Savini got his expertise in real life gore with the unfortunate reality of being in the vietnam war, and seeing all those human natrocities. Savini used his Vietnam experience with gore in his special effects. The result in Friday The 13th is incredible, understand Friday The 13th was produced before digital effects were even concieved. Special effects were done with knowledege and old fashion know how. The music score by Harry Manfredini is classic and at times makes this movie shine. Eerie and creepy Manfredinis soundtrack scared the hell out me when I first saw this movie 20+ years ago. Director Sean S. Cunningham and writer Victor Miller followed the Halloween 1978 success, great move because Friday The 13th grossed over $40,000,000 in 1980, an unheard of sum for a horror movie especially a movie of this genre in 1980. The thing that amazes me with this first installment of Friday The 13th, is that none of the woman are goregeous babes in the woods as the later 13th movies prounced on. Adrienne King though not georgeous plays a believable leading woman with courage and stanima. The whole Friday The 13th cast played each of their parts creatively and brilliantly. Sean S. Cunningham, concentrated on horror and gore in this movie, not beautiful babes in the woods, which don't get me wrong I love to look at in a slasher movie.  Many immitators have copied Friday The 13th in many ways the hockey mask, make love than get killed etc. The Friday The 13th franchise has earned over $500,000,000, that is the reason for the endless array of ridiculous sequals. I do like Part III the best out of all the sequals. Though at times boring, ""Friday The 13th"" still works its horror, gore magic even today in 2007.......",1149897600,3,2238,4.721227621483376
237489,4,6300214087,"1st off, to Pal Amundsen, why would you compare Friday the 13th to the Exorcist? I think I know why. Because it was easy, right? The Exocist is the scariest movie ever made, and to compare it to F13 is like comparing a scooter (F13) to a harley davidson (The Exorcist); yeah we get it. Take your ignorant opinion somewhere else, you close-minded horror ""fan"".

Anyway, this is one of the greatest Slasher movies ever made.

Compared to other Slasher movies like Nightmare on Elm Street or Halloween, there may not be anything scary or suspensful about F13. But hey, it's still a good thriller, and better than today's ""horror"" movies *cough House of the Dead cough*. It's about young Jason who is drowned at Camp Crystal Lake. His mother, a counsler at the camp, vows to kill whoever comes to Crystal Lake. And... well, that's really all you need to know. Just watch it! It's pretty good, and at times unpredictable (like when corpses are thrown through windows). The re-makes of F13 were pretty decent (with the exception of F13, in my opinion), but nothing beats the original. Still, you have to give credit to the directors of the other F13 movies, as they gave life to Jason Voorhees: one of horror's greatest icons!

F13 is recommended from a big Slasher fan. Also watch the sequals, which are WAY better than everyone says they are. Also, look out for the new F13 movie that should be out in 2007, and is being produced by Michael Bay (at least that's what I heard from my sources).

Other Slasher films I recommend:

Nightmare On Elm Street

NOES part 3

NOES part 4

NOES part 7

F13 part 7

F13 part 8

Halloween

Halloween part 4

237490,2,6300214087,"After viewing this a couple of times in my life, I still wonder why people say this is one of the classics. Sure, it spawned it's sequels and some rip-offs and wannabes, but there's nothing really special about this first entry.

 The story is mediocre at best. We see camp counselors get killed up until the end when we learn why. And the reason why - given in the movie - is a bit out there. And the pace that the film takes is a little slow. The acting isn't amazing, but there are some good performances. Kevin Bacon? Yes ma'ams and sirs. But Why they chose Adrienne King as their lead does baffle me. Her acting is laughable, and really didn't make me cheer for her as the heroine of the film. Betsy Palmer's psycho Ms. Voorhees was great, though. And especially keeping with the time of the film, her insane persona was written well and executed well.

 One thing that a lot of people relate with the F13 movies is the gore displayed. Perhaps in the early 80s, the gore shown in F13 was insane. But after viewing it today, there's nothing really spectacular about it. And as for the cut version that is seen by most viewers, there are some kills that are cut or not even shown.

 Friday the 13th was actually the last Friday that I watched after seeing Jason X. Silly for me to end with the last Friday, but I'm sort of glad that I did. It's the least favorite of mine from the series. Only because it lacks a lot of what the sequels have.",1149120000,,1445,4.274725274725275

If you haven't seen it I will not spoil it, but this was stealing a good plot from ""Psycho""... and totally wasting it! The picture quality is horrible, the sound just as bad. It's like watching a home movie. And I guess there is reason why the movie company had no urge to clean the tapes or enhance the sound here. It certainly would not have paid off I persume.

 The film came out in 1980,and has paved the way for dozens of other terror movies to borrow from.

 This one boasts a young Kevin Bacon,Bing Crosby`s son,Harry,

and a very memorable and informative performance from Betsy Palmer. The funniest actor in this one is Mark Nelson,who plays

Ned. The film also stars Laurie Bartram,Robbie Morgan,Peter Brouwer,Jeanine Taylor,and of course,Adrienne King,who plays

the film`s heroin,Alice.

 Friday the 13th contains one of the most shocking scenes ever captured on the silver screen,seen toward the ending.

 Perhaps the most understated element of this picture is in it`s

beautiful setting. It was shot in an area in and near Blairstown,New Jersey,and has the most attractive setting of any

of the Friday films.

 The most disturbing concept of this movie is that it could really happen. The counselors are savagely murdered one by one by

Betsy Palmer,who blames them for the death of her son,Jason,who

drowned at Camp Crystal Lake in 1957 without any supervision from the counselors there.

One by one, they are knocked off realising there's someone else at the lake who is hellbent on ensuring they stay clear of the area.  The penalty for trespassing is death!  Unlike Halloween, Friday the 13th relies heavily on gore, a good idea at the time as eighties horror fans would have been pleased by this much to the disgust of film censors at the time.

237536,4,6300214087,"Hi, before I start I would just like to let everyone know that I am a 19 year old female. And the reason I feel to share that is because now a days it seems that being my age allows you to be spoiled by the standards for horror filming today. I just want to let everyone know that while I may be spoiled to it, I can also enjoy a classic such as Friday The 13th and not be biased.

I have been watching the Friday the 13th series since I can remember, but I never watched it on tape, I only saw it on TV. And while every Friday the 13th is cut in some way, it's severely cut on tv. I was very surprised to watch it on dvd, for the first time, simply because it was like I was watching it for the first time. There had been scenes that I didn't know existed, because I was limited to what they show on TV.

I have the box set, and if I were to rate that ..I'd give it a very poor 2 - 3 stars, simply because I feel that the Friday the 13th series deserves better than what it's recieved in the box set. But the movies alone, I adore.

I love the feeling of being scared, I love the feeling of thinking that something can really happen. I love the fact that I, only in my opinion, am terrified of this series and some others like it. I don't have to have A+ ratings in graphics to be scared. I just need some killings, and jump out of your seat thrills. And I think for the most part, almost all of these movies gives you that.

For the longest time I didn't like this particular part, because I was like every other juvenile teenager ..I loved Jason, and since Jason wasn't in it, I didn't care for it. Well, it's recently been played on AMC back to back, and I sat down and actually watched it ...and I loved it. I love it even more that i've actually seen the R version of the movie. Jason Voorhees doesn't have to be in this, because I feel that his mother doing the killings is probably more scarier than anything, because that's something that could actually happen.

Storyline (Not exactly in order, but the way I feel best describing) -- (Possible Spoilers)

When you sit down to watch this, you know that you're sitting down to a horror movie. But the way it comes on, dead of night, serene water, clear blue moon ..and kids sleeping silently in the cabin, you for one second feel that you could possibly be watching a family movie. Teenager counselors are singing cheesy sing a long songs ..and you feel a sense of peace.

That is ..until your hip to the two horn dogs, who clearly can not keep their eyes off of each other. The song finishes, and off they go to explore each other. I'm not entirely mad that they got killed off ..there's kids in the other cabin ..I think you should wait until you're alone, alone. That was there fault, and they get knocked off. The person was so free of mercy, that you'd never think that it was who it was doing the killings.

So, you're fully into the movie at this point ..just waiting to see who gets kicked off this time. And we zoom into this pretty, innocent, friendly looking girl named Annie. For a few seconds if not more, you would assume that she was the one who would last to the ending credits. She pets a homeless looking dog, which I love (I love animals), and goes on about her way.

She stops into this little diner, and asks for assistance to Camp Crystal Lake. Where she recieves curious, yet knowing glances that she notices, but seems to ignores. They do a little chit chat, someone calls it camp blood, no biggie, and a truck driver offers her a ride atleast have way there.

Also on there way to the serene lake is Jack, Marcie, and the ever funny Ned. They have a little fun conversation on the way ..that's what I love about this movie ..the parts that would seem slow in most movies, just flows on beautifully, I feel. I was never bored in watching the scenes where they interact with each other, I felt it put a little more depth into the movie.

Allison -- Upon seeing her ..At first I don't see her as the person that would last. I'd give that credit to Brenda ..but I guess in a sense she's more dependant than most of the girls there. After everyone arrives (excluding Annie), you get to see Steve and Allison talking ..and for a moment you feel a bit of a connection with the two that's never really touched on. I feel more feelings on his part than hers. I would've really loved to know the reason why she needed to get home, or why she didn't want to stay, but they didn't touch on that either.

Bill, is one of my favorite characters ..he's just a very nice guy, and not annoying or anything, I really felt that he would've survived to, or at least I would've rooted him on. I would've also liked to see some feelings between him and Allison.

Annie gets dropped off by the Truck Driver after contridicting herself some ..and walks on just to get picked up by another person. Which by the look on Annie's face ..seems to be someone friendly. But who's to say ...

Annie talks to the driver, but the driver never answers her ..or says anything at all. Not even a little grunt to let you know they're still alive, lolol. They just drives, and seems irritated, because they end up driving a lot faster than they were doing. They end up missing the turn to Camp Crystal Lake ..I guess by now Annie seems suspicious, since her cries for them to stop or surpassed. She looks frightened, still begging to be dropped off ..she ends up jumping out of the car.

Now she could've easily, easily ran off ..if she hadn't hurt her poor ankle. So she has to limp ..and that seems to be somewhat dangerous, seeing as what we now know is the killer back tracks and comes after her. She gives a good run for a minute ..and I guess you can figure out what happens next ..

So, back at the cabins, they're all getting settled in ..and Steve goes out to do some ""Errands"" Which I feel that the diner he was sitting at later that night, was probably where he was the entire time, lol. They all give each other a break and cool off in the pool ..where Ned acts like a jackass and Brenda thinks she sees someone in forest ..but of course shrugs it off.

............

Fast forwarding to the near end ..you can guess that most of the cast gets killed off, so you don't need me to explain that ..but when meeting the killer ..Mrs. Voorhees, it seems like the woman next door, baking brownies and cookies for Fund Raisers.

But she also seems like a woman that would love her child unconditionally ..and losing your only child must be kind of rough ..so in the psychological point of view you can kind of see where she's coming from.

When she jumps out of the jeep to ""rescue"" Allison ..you're thinking all is well ..everything's great ..Allison's gonna get out alive and she has this nice woman to think. Until she starts talking rubbish about not being afraid ..when any SANE person would've high tailed it out once they found out that ""they're all dead"".

She goes on some type of trippy flash back trip ..and you can see the demonic glare in her eyes ..from then on you know this woman is loopy, and Allison feels it too. Then she starts talking to ..her dead son ..and you realize that Allison better get out of there.

The fight between the two is realistic ..Allison held up her own, and she's a strong girl so you can believe that. I guess in that sense, I couldn't see Brenda holding up in this scene. The End is near ..finally, for Allison after the final strike, she is at peace ..she takes a canoe ..and moves out onto the lake.

Then before you know it ..birds are singing, the crisp, bright, sun is shining down ..the police men are out ..and it's finally over. She sits up ..and then out of nowhere young Jason jumps out and attacks her.

I don't know if that was a dream ..or if it was suppose to be real, I can never be sure. But you instantly knew that there was some type of sequel ahead. It left room for one, so you were expecting it.

All in all ..I love this movie. I love it for the thrills ..for the killings ..even for the dialogue and acting. Was it Oscar winning performances? No. But that's what I like about it ..it's not big actors and actresses taht you know of. It seems like someone was there filming everything happen. It's like it's real. The acting was that of a real person, and that makes it more appealing, in the sense that you're there, these are real people, and this is happening.

To judge this movie on it's acting ..would be idiotic, because that's not what they made it for ..the reason I think that made it for ..it does REALLY good in that area.

If you're just going to watch this to compare it to Halloween that's gonna be a waste ..I love Halloween too, but I don't see some of the similiarites that other people claim to see in it ..watch it, just to watch it ..not to compare it to other movies like it.

237537,3,6300214087,"The ""Friday the 13th"" franchise has proved remarkably successful. Screenwriter Victor Miller's psychotic anti-hero Jason has featured in nine sequels, spanning nearly 20 years. The films have achieved tremendous popular notoriety, and spawned a merchandising empire that includes comics, T-shirts, and action figures. All of which proves how little originality and good film-making have to do with making money.

This first film tells the story of a group of randy teenagers who take summer jobs at Camp Crystal Lake, a run-down New Jersey summer camp. The camp has a dark past, and an even darker resident: the psycho in a hockey mask who hacks our comely teens to death. One by one, they are despatched with a variety of crude weaponry, including knives, hatchets, spears, and arrows.

It was not the first teen 'stalk-n-slash' film and certainly not the most creative, but it was undeniably a hugely influential film that contributed to the 1980s horror boom. The film's success was in its ability to understand what made audiences tick, and then manipulate it ruthlessly. It took the shock violence of nihilistic 1970s gore-fests such as ""Zombie Flesh Eaters"" and ""Driller Killer"", added some sexually active teenagers, and achieved something approaching mass appeal in the process.

Ultimately the film's box office success was down to exploitation. It teases the audience with an attractive cast and a smattering of nudity, and panders cynically to their fantasies and fears about power and powerlessness, voyeurism and cruelty.",1141948800,,1534,5.304526748971194
237538,5,6300214087,"This movie has become one of the most well-known horror movies ever made. It continues to be as popular and scary today as when it was when it was first released in 1980.

The story goes like this. Camp Crystal Lake has been shut down for over twenty years.  In 1958, two camp counselors were brutally murdered, and the year before, a young boy drowned in the lake because the counselors were not paying any attention to him.  The boy's name was Jason Voorhies.

Fast forward to the ""present day"".  Steve Christy (Peter Brower) has purchased Camp Crystal Lake with the intention of re-opening it as a campground for inner-city children to spend their summers.  Steve has hired six counselors: Alice (Adrienne King), Bill (Harry Crosby), Marcie (Jeannine Taylor), Annie (Robbi Morgan), Ned (Mark Nelson), Claudette (Debra hayes), and Jack (Kevin Bacon).  Their job is to clean up the camp to get it ready for a group of children who are due to be arriving.  Despite the warnings of the camp being called a curse and many of the locals calling it ""camp blood"", the group presses on with their work.

Soon, however, this peaceful campground once again turns into a nightmare as the camp counselors are mercilessly killed until only Alice is left.  As she tries to escape, she is confronted by a woman who introduces herself as Mrs. Voorhies.  Initially, Alice is relieved, but her relief quickly turns to terror as she discovers that Mrs. Voorhies is the one who is responsible for the deaths of the others.  Will Alice survive, or will she meet the same fate as her friends?

This movie and its nine highly successful sequels have become classics of the horror movie genre.  What makes this movie so scary is that the majority of the action takes place in the dark, so the fear factor is heightened by the absence of daylight.  The rolling thunderstorm also adds to the suspense.  The story of the movie is excellent, and the young boy in the lake will become legendary in the films that followed this one.

I highly recommend this movie.  The level of terror and suspense is quite high throughout the movie, and the story is very good.  This movie is a must-see for horror movie fans, as well as all of the successful sequels that followed.  Watch this movie and meet one of the true legends of horror films.",1140652800,3,2307,4.649382716049383
237579,4,6300214087,"I have a very vivid memory of being 8 years old and sitting on the floor of my parents' living room, with the ""weekend"" section of the Post open in front of me. There is an advert for a movie called ""Friday the 13th."" It depicted a drawing of some anxious-looking teens standing in a group in front of a lonely cabin, surrounded by sinster woods, with a moon-silvered lake in the background. Superimposed over this was the silhouette of an adrogynous figure holding a knife. The caption read: ""They were warned. They are doomed. And on Friday the 13th, nothing can save them.""

Of course I had no idea that this ""disposable"" low-budget horror flick would make a mountain of dough and be exploited mercilessly in an endless parade of increasingly formulaic and stupid sequels. Neither did star Betsy Palmer, who said of her decision to take the role as Mrs. Voorhees: ""I didn't like the script, I didn't understand the movie and I thought the whole thing was crap, but I needed a new car. Plus I figured no one would ever see it."" My own first experience with the series came five years later when I saw ""Part V: A New Beginning"", which begs the question of why the hell I ever watched the rest of them. I must say I'm glad I did, because otherwise I wouldn't have caught this immortal slasher classic.

""Friday"" is the story of a man named Steve Christie who is attempting to start up a summer camp for inner-city kids in a remote place called Crystal Lake. Christie is what you would call obsessed with this idea, and proceeds despite the evil history of the place (a double murder 20 years before and a long series of incidents since) as well as warnings from a local nutjob named Crazy Ralph, who blathers on about a ""Death Curse"" that hangs over the area. [this constinutes the 'THEY WERE WARNED' part of the advertisement, and Ralph should have heeded it: he gets a barbed-wire neck massage in ""Part II""]

Enter a group of nubile twentysomethings who are the camp staff. [THEY ARE DOOMED] These kids unwittingly go about camp business, which seems mainly to involve smoking pot, drinking beer, and premarital sex (can I go to this camp?) while they are stalked and viciously murdered one-by-one by an unseen killer (on second thought, never mind). Plucky actress Adrienne King stumbles on the identity of the axe, knife, & arrow-wielding psycho a bit too late to get any help from co-stars like a young Kevin Bacon, who himself discovers a might too late that the someone under his bed ain't the tooth fairy. [ON FRIDAY THE 13TH NOTHING CAN SAVE THEM]

There was, of course, not much original (even in 1980) with this Ten Little Indians"" approach. And there are a few moments of ""horror-movie stupidity"" which are so glaring that you aren't even sorry to see the victims get theirs. For example, towards the end of the film, the two surviving characters, not having noticed that everyone is dead, go into a friend's cabin. She is gone, and in her bed in a bloodstained axe. When they go back outside, they finally discover everyone else is missing and the car has been disabled. At this point many would be alarmed into, say, caution. The guy says: ""I'm sure there's a perfectly rational explantion for all of this!"" Of course there is, dumbass, it's that there's a killer on the loose! Then the power is cut, whereupon this blockhead volunteers to go to the spooky power shed by himself in the dark....and the girl lets him. (Possibly she wanted him to ""distract"" the killer while she got away.) Furthermore, the number of times Adrienne King beats down Betsy Palmer and has her helpless, only to then run away and let her get back up again, gave me the feel that the scriptwriter might have worked for pro wrestling before he turned his pen to horror. Honey, JUST FINISH HER OFF.

Stuff like this could have derailed the movie. What made it work was the little things: 1) The music. Nobody who has ever heard ""ch-ch-ch, ha-ha-ha"" can ever forget it. 2) The cinematography. Especially brilliant use was made of characters emerging slowly, at a great distance, from complete darkness (and later, in the running-away scenes, of them submerging into it, as if sinking into the depths of a black lake: incredibly creepy and effective). 3) The inventiveness of the murders: in ""Part VI"" there is a scene, actually two scenes, where Jason simply kicks in a door and murders the woman behind it. That type of thing fortunately doesn't happen here (just ask Kevin Bacon).

""Friday"" isn't like its successors. There's no Jason (excactly), no hockey mask, and the body count is a very modest half-dozen, two of which are offscreen. The identity of the killer itself is hidden until the very end. If the whole ""pot/beer/sex = death"" formula seems incredibly hackneyed nonetheless, it always helps to remember that this was one of the films that wrote it.",1140652800,2,4849,4.665497076023392

After an accidental drowning of a boy in 1957 ay Camp Crystal Lake, the camp once again attempts a re-opening 22 years later. The counselors head up to the camp to get the Summer started when strang things start happening. The local crazy warns them of the ""death curse"", the teenager in charge of the cafeteria never shows and the local deputy ""Officer Dorf"" stirs up even more craziness.

Night comes after head counselor Steve Christie leaves for the night. The teens start to be killed off one by one by a stalking, mudering figure. When there is one person left at the camp the killer finalls shows face... in a shocking twist of events.

[good things]

This movie has everything a slasher should-- stalking, suspense, scares, violent deaths, blood and ignorant teenagers (although some of the teenagers are more 20+). I loved the story of this movie, it was an easy to relate to story, and a very plausible story. Once again, Tom Savini's blood and gore was phenominal. The deaths that were onscreen were great. The leading lady, Adrienne King was an innocent, virginal cutie. One of the best slasher heroines ever. Besides all of that the characters were all great, and easy to like. The Crazy Ralph character was a great touch and added alot to the movie. The infamous last chair jumper' scene is hands-down the best ever in slasher history.

[the bad]

Some things that this movie lacks is good acting and good dialogue. However, the story is very easy to get sucked into, and both negatives are very easy to forgive.

[final thoughts]

Regardless of what the critics and even some fans say, this is still one of the best Friday The 13ths. Who cares if the movie lacks a 'hockey-masked killer'. Cunningham really hit the nail on the head, and this movie still remains the best movie he has been a part of. I do suggest watching the uncut version of this movie, although the movie was only cut a couple dozen seconds, the added blood really adds alot to the deaths.

The movie has a really serious cold and trapped feeling to it, something only the first few sequels managed to capture.",1136246400,5,2117,4.654155495978553
237584,5,6300214087,"If you want to get technical about it and are a true horror fan like I, you would know that ""Friday the 13th"" is actually a knock-off of ""Halloween"" (1978), which in itself is a knock-off of ""Black Christmas"" made 4 years prior to that. But if you dig deeper into the birth of slasher movies, you can go a bit earlier to 1971 with the foreign film by Mario Bava called ""Bay of Blood"" aka ""Twitch of the Death Nerve"". But, it was ""Friday the 13th"" that was the pied piper that would lead an endless list of great (and not so great) slasher films in the early '80s. It basically blasted the  sub-genre of slasher horror from it's cabin door hinges! So, enough about the origins of the slasher era, we'll get to the classic that is FRIDAY THE 13th!

The film is next to perfect in it's execution (haha, no pun intended?).  A decent cast for what you're gonna get in a low budget picture like this.  They really lucked out with Kevin Bacon.  And Betsy Palmer really stole the show as the worst mother in movie history since Faye Dunaway's role as Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest""!  The atmosphere is great, and the location where it was filmed is the best out of any Friday the 13th movie (the worst location being part 3...was THAT mudhole even a lake?).  The good thing about this movie (as opposed to the many artless imitations out there) is that the tension builds gradually until it hits a grand apex. This, however, is one of the things some people find annoying about this movie, but unless you have ADHD then you will follow the story as it gains momentum.  I won't get into a detailed description of the plot itself in this review(everyone should know the plot by now),I just wanted to take the time to point out the greatness of this film in the horror universe. Further, the ending is the still one of the most frightening and heart stopping moments in horror history! No one can deny that.

There are a few things that taint this otherwise flawless piece of work, and that is the highly edited death scenes.  I know that it was the MPAA that did it and not the director or anyone involved in the film, but I think they should have tried to get away with alot more.  There are simply too many off-screen murders! Out of 10 deaths, 5 of them are off screen which is mainly because they couldn't get away with showing the scene because it was ""too violent"" and also because the effects didn't work out the way they were intended.  I have read that Brenda's death scene was originally her being impaled by a few arrows while standing in the rain at the archery, but it was cut by the MPAA. Marcie's face axing scene was intended to be shown without any film cuts which means you would have seen the ax hit her face, but they couldn't get the effects just right to do it that way so they had to cut away to the ax, then show her fall to the floor with the ax in her face (still turned out very well).  The quick cuts of the death scenes is another annoyance (once again you can thank the MPAA), you get no more than a full second of screen time on any given end result of a gore killing.  The one standout gore scene in the whole movie goes to the death of Kevin Bacon's character Jack who gets an arrow through the neck from the killer hiding under the bed (a scenario that creeped me out as a kid!) They show everything, and the fact that they didn't have computer graphics back then really showed the filmaker's creativity in doing these death scenes from scratch. BUT don't even try to watch this on network TV, because you may not even notice you're watching a horror film. It's overly (and needlessly) edited of all gore.

Although some of it's sequels may surpass this film's body count, visual effects, and coolness factor, they will never match the sheer shock value that this movie possesses.  And that is simply why this is the best one in the series.",1134777600,7,3867,4.35
237585,4,6300214087,"Friday the 13th is the original slasher. The movie is made in 1980 with Besty Palmer being the savage killer in this one. One of the only shock endings in horror ive ever seen.

In the VHS version, after Mrs. Voorhees is decapitated the camera lingers on her headless body a little bit longer, enough for us to see her body raise up both her arms and hands before falling down. That last part on the dvd is taken out.  You do see her beheaded, but they cut to the girl's reaction. You don't see the body briefly raise both fists. The DVD cuts to the body falling down.  On the other hand, fans of Kevin Bacon will be pleased to note that on the DVD version the camera lingers on his bare backside a minute longer than on the VHS.

237630,4,6300214087,"I cannot give any hack-n-slash movie a five star rating but this comes mighty close.  It is the bulk of the Jason Vorhees story of all movies in the last 30 or so minutes of this first movie told by his mother(Betsy Palmer).  The prologue is vague and not very informative at all. Some of the reviews have added things not in the movie such as the poison lake in '64 or some such but it wasn't in the movie so it didn't happen.  Where as Jason is dumb, witless, awkward, and even weak(at times) as was the woosie-boy in ""Red Eye"". his loving mom is smart, clever(with a capital cleaver), agile, and very very strong(comes across when grabbing little bitty Adenne King and shaking her like a rag doll.) The movie is more alfred Hitchcock than a teenage slash as in it is not known who this killer is.  Pretend you did not see the sequals and don't know of this ""Jason"" person and you'll fully appriciate this.  The inconsisitancy lies(most neglect to point out) in the pool(My LEAST favorite scene) where Jason is a decaying little kid but only one I repeat ONE year later(1981) he is a full grown adult.  If you miss the point of this argument you  are not reading(or listening) to this carefully.  The sequal is also good(King gets a pick to the head by loving son of Vorhees and forces said refrigorator item into mother-slaying bitch).  Why Jace grows so fast(in decaying form) is anyone's guess.  Why he did not grow from 1958-80 is beyond me. Anyone saying the movie is not good because no hockey mask is missing the point of not only this movie, but every Friday 13th movie.  In part three Jace finds the hockey mask and is aware and even ashamed(I think) of how bad he looks to the lovely teenage girls; Shallow miscrents! and so dons the ""Helm of Horror"".  Shallow miscrents!",1130630400,,1783,4.469135802469136
237631,1,6300214087,"How this movie became wildly popular and spawned other terds I will never know. Watch this movie again. It's probably been awhile since you've seen it. I equate it to watching Gilligan's Island again. You can't help but think how the hell anyone watched it in the first place....This movie is crap. Horribly directed, dreadfully edited and everything else that makes a movie laughable. Mystery Science Theater 3000 should of had a field day with this one!

 There are extended scenes which I quess are supposed to be suspenseful, but only reveal the lack of any real script. I can only imagine the director's orders: ""O.k, now walk around and pretend to make coffee for ten minutes..Oh and try to look scared.""

 SPOILER ALERT (but who the hell cares): The climax is absolutely hilarious. It's perhaps the longest and most silly cat fight ever filmed. Jason doesn't really show up until the rip-off (CARRIE) last five seconds....But who cares about him. Freddie should of kicked his mamas boy's ass. And Michael Myers would tear him a new one (that is based on the first movie in each respective series. Of course all their sequels suck)...",1130630400,3,1140,4.8307692307692305
237632,4,6300214087,"Many of us have been in those scenario's where you're watching a horror movie, and then we say ""yep, I've already seen this."" Well, FRIDAY THE 13TH might seem like one of those by-the-numbers slasher flicks. But in all reality, it's not. It's got a mind of its own, and director/producer Sean Cunningham had no idea he was going to make a movie that made more money than THE SHINING did, which came out that same year.

FRIDAY THE 13TH takes place at Camp Crystal Lake, a place notorious for the drowning of a boy named Jason Voorhees. The student camp counselors are there for a weekend of fun and sex, sleaze and booze, but in all seriousness they are preparing for the kids who are due to arrive in just a few days. Little do they know there's a maniac on the loose who, one by one, dispatches with the young, hormone-driven population. But by the time the killer gets to Alice, the real killer is exposed. That's where the one fault lies...the killer explained her motives for killing off the sex-driven teens, and that gave Alice a chance to fight off Mrs. Voorhees, a mother who loved her son so much that she would lose her head for him, and she literally did. The ending of the movie is infamous, as many moviegoers and collectors alike fell for the ""dream"" sequence that flowed into the ""real"" ending of the film. Of course, that was one of the movies big strengths.

This was one of the first movies to star Kevin Bacon, and his performance was bulletproof, even if his character's grim fate was not. Betsy Palmer originally didn't want to do this movie (she's not a movie buff by any means, and admitted that after this movie, she got more fan mail than any other film), but she did the movie to afford her car. Her performance is creepy, and she convinced me that she was out for revenge. Adrienne King was cast well as Alice, and her scenes of running and battling Mrs. Palmer were actually quite good. And of course, who can forget the dream sequence of ""rain and blood""; the discordant violins that make up that all-too-chilling score by Manfriedi; and then the fact that Jason is not the killer in this movie, that's what really intrigued me about this movie. It was a smart move by Cunningham, and it really kept us in the dark until Mrs. Voorhees herself appeared on screen.

FRIDAY THE 13TH is probably the best in the entire series, but it's not the only good one, although some of the series lacks the punch this one kick-started when it came out over 25 years ago. Grossing over $40 million dollars at the box office in America alone, FRIDAY THE 13TH is really the only entry casual moviegoers need bare witness to, unless you want to check out the sequels...but be warned...ch-ch-ch ka-ka-ka...",1130025600,,2717,4.5182926829268295
237633,4,6300214087,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It goes like this: At Camp Crystal Lake, otherwise known as Camp Blood(muhahahaha!)it is said that the camp is cursed. With sadistic, grisly death. Some really stupid people ignore the warning and go anyway. Pretty soon there is a lot of death by means of bladed weapons going on, lots of slicing, dicing, slashing, impaling, anything involving some manner of cutting instrument. When she is the only one left, a very young frightened woman named Alice finds out that the killer is who else but Pamela Voorhees. Seems she blames the camp for letting her 11 year old son Jason drown, and wants them dead. She fights with Alice, and though I won't give away the ending, I most certainly will say that if you like bloody, hideous horror films, this is for you. One can only imagine how much I'll love the sequels when Jason(who by the way is my # 1 favorite boogeyman)takes over the job of destroying Camp Crystal Lake for dear old mom. Happy Halloween, helpless victims. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! And remember, don't watch these movies-ALONE......!",1129939200,,1123,4.884816753926701
237634,3,6300214087,Friday the 13th is one of the first movies to start the slasher flicks trend in the 80's.  The acting is okay but really no one would talk like that.  The gore is pretty high but I think it would be scarier if more of the kills were off screen.  I have to say the music is very similar to the Psycho theme.  The old atmosphere gives the film a creepier feel.  The only part that bothered me was the end fight because it was really cheesy.  I won't say because I don't want to spoil it for people who want to see it.  The movie is a mystery movie where a group of people stay together and one of them is the killer.  Its like 10 little Indians and House on the Haunted Hill.  This is definitely a movie for gore hounds.,1125100800,,718,3.965034965034965

It's about Jason drowning because people aren't watching him because they're doing........ stuff.......... well, you get it. Now his mom is going around and killing everyone.

237667,2,6300214087,"I Used to prefer Jason istead of Freddy. I'd not seen ""Friday the 13th"" Early parts. It seems on contrary with ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series which grew worse, Episode after episode, in this series last episodes are better than earlies! and Jason-X which considered as the last Jason movie was an spotlight in the series!

This movie released in 1980. the most close contemporary of this movie was ""Halloween - part 1"". this movie has really nothing to say in front of that movie. It's an exremely low budget movie. It's not even scary. Dead scenes are Ridicolous and very Unsophisticated. It's Just like an student film. So, what's the benefit of buying a low budget movie that's not even scary? Buying this movie as a part of ""Friday the 13th Ultimate DVD Collection"" is not a bad idea but buying this DVD individually is A real waste of money! Even a kid can't enjoy it.

The only good thing I could find here was a great horror music, hope the movie was as good as it's music.",1121990400,,982,4.4804469273743015

In this first installment in the F13 series Pamela Voorhees is pissed off about her sons death at the camp in 1957 so goes back a year later and kills two of the counselors. The camp closes shortly after remains closed till 1980. The seven counselors and there boss getting killed one by one till the only survivor, Alice, relizes that everyone's dead and then meets Pamela Voorhees. I do prefer some of the other F13 films better but I have to give this one credit because it started it all. A must own for any slasher fan.",1121385600,4,632,4.364406779661017
237669,3,6300214087,"This film relied on marketing for its success. The commericals counted down all the victims one by one, quickly, and if you paid attention, you knew who was going to bite it, not good if you want to connect with a character when you see her as number four in the commerical. If I was a high school student in 1980, why not grab friends and a date, and watch people get murdered in various fashions. A cheap date, unless you splurge for popcorn, and ju ju beans. This film basically shows off Tom Savini's skills as a makeup artist,......you have to admit he is a God in that department. The identity of the killer is quite hidden, but when you find out, it is a bit of a disapointment, but otherwise the film looks great on Dvd, the infamous soundtrack is now legendry, but the film is slow, the acting is mediocre, and the plot is just too simple, why did the killer wait for 22 years to seek revenge? Only because Camp Crystal Lake was reopening, if the killer had a vendetta, I'm sure it would have took place years earlier. The best slasher kill, Kevin Bacon on the lower bunkbed, a surprise and gory, but you have to be a musclehead to get the arrow through the bed, o-well, this film is fun and a good time with friends.",1120435200,,1226,4.288793103448276

237672,5,6300214087,"This review refers to the Paramount DVD edition of the film.

THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Jeannine Taylor, Robbi Morgan, Kevin Bacon, Harry Crosby, Laurie Bartram, Mark Nelson. Special Make-Up Effects By Tom Savini. Score Composed By Harry Manfredini. Associate Produced By Stephen Miner. Produced and Directed By Sean S. Cunningham. (R) For Violence, Gore, Very Mild Profanity, Drug Use, Very Brief Nudity and Mild Sexual Content; 95m.; 1980.

WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: While this film can't stake a claim as being the start of the modern day slasher movie (that honor goes to 1978's ""Halloween""), it nevertheless features a lot of key staples that would become trademarks of the genre. Camp counselors gather at a secluded lake ten miles from the nearest crossroads. There, they try to ready a dilapidated set of cabins in order to re-open the summer camp. Not heeding the warnings from local looney ""Crazy"" Ralph (Walt Gorney), our hapless gang of victims is slowly picked off by an unseen killer on the unluckiest day of the year. This film isn't a good example of a plot heavy melodrama, rather an excursion into the low budget land of terror and gore. Director Sean S. Cunningham has ensured that this film is much slower paced when compared to the innumerable sequels that followed. Instead of being an impediment, however, it aids in the momentum of the movie. The drawn out moments exist to provide tension and to fully feel the isolation of the lake. We sense a depressive awareness of just how alone our ill-fated counselors really are. One minor flaw does permeate the festivities. Most of the cast members are given ample screen time, though very few of them make the best of their performances. Even Kevin Bacon turns in a generic exhibition as Jack. The standout roles belong to comic cut-up Ned (Mark Nelson) and level-headed Alice (Adrienne King) while the most demanding role is filled by the wonderful Betsy Palmer (as a former cook at Camp Crystal Lake). Bridging the suspenseful screenplay and the taut direction is one of the most terrifying musical scores in horror history. Harry Manfredini crafted a lush, rubric backdrop which he would carry over through scads of sequels. Overall, this is an imaginatively produced terror masterpiece that will stay with the viewer long after the lights have come back up.

THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: The 1.85:1 widescreen transfer of this film appears too dark in some of the night time scenes. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the outdoor daytime locations are rich and vibrant while color tones are mostly bright and lifelike. There are moments of grain but it's still a cut above any video release of the film. Unfortunately, there's a distinct hiss on the accompanying 2.0 mono soundtrack if you turn the volume up too high. It's a shame since the voices seem natural, sound effects are sharply defined and the background score is clear. Doubly shameful is the fact that a 5.1 surround sound mix could not have been added to this disc. Lesser fright films than this were graced with the commanding presence of a surround sound. There's also a French mono track available for the movie and English subtitles which are easy to read and have been placed within the frame of the film. The front cover for this plastic case is a reproduction of the original video release cover. The back cover is a typical Paramount mishmash of images and information. There is a one sheet insert inside of the case that gives the fifteen chapter stops for this ninety-five minute presentation. The disc itself has the title of the film, the Paramount logo and a few other morsels of information painted on its silver surface. Paramount is known for releasing movies with below average special features. This classic horror movie suffers from the simple fact that the only special feature made available is the original theatrical trailer (2:31). The trailer is presented in a 1.85:1 widescreen format that reveals just enough of the movie to draw viewers in without disclosing too much.

THE YOLK'S ON YOU: Paramount has never been known for plying their releases with additional footage, let alone hiding some on the disc. You're more likely to survive a night at Camp Crystal Lake than you are of finding hidden easter eggs on this one.

THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: Lascivious viewers are given the opportunity to see Marcie (Jeannine Taylor) in her little white panties as she becomes intimate with Jack (Kevin Bacon). We're also treated to a brief glimpse of her left breast after the pair has made love. We're then privy to more of Marcie's panties as she makes a visit to the restroom. Later in the film, the gorgeous Brenda (Laurie Bartram) is seen in her underwear during a heated game of strip poker.

THE GORE REPORT: In the 1958 flashback that opens this film, gore hounds get to see one of the male counselors receive a fairly graphic gut shot. Moving into the present, the new cook Annie (Robbi Morgan) has her throat slashed in the forest and some splendidly deep red blood runs out of the wound. One calamitous counselor is smashed in the head with an axe while another is gruesomely stapled to a wooden door by a handful of arrows. There's also a passable decapitation sequence in the movie. Legendary make-up artist Tom Savini definitely has a chance to show his enormous talent in these death scenes.

SAY AGAIN: ""Well, at least we know what's for dinner."" - Marcie (Jeannine Taylor) in reference to a snake killed in one of the rooms.

THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. Paramount has recently re-released the classic eight ""Friday the 13th"" films in a boxed set. They've added some wonderful special features to the set, however they've also placed all eight movies on flip discs. They've also done nothing to enhance the soundtracks of the films and the visuals have remained the same. Faithful fans of the ""Friday"" films should demand better releases of these quintessential specimens of macabre majesty. They most certainly deserve them. But until Paramount gets off its lazy backside, these lightweight individual editions of the films are still the way to go.

237693,4,6300214087,"This may not be as good as Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street, but its still one of my favorite slasher films of all time. The first in the neverending series, this was one of the first in the long line of 80's slasher flicks as well. True, the acting is second rate [although Palmer is very good as the deranged Mrs. Voorhees], the writing is sloppy, the suspense is minimal, and its just another teen exploitation flick. But in spite of all this, somehow this film remains fun even after all these years.

 So just in case you don't know the story, here it goes. In 1957 at Camp Crystal Lake, a young boy drowned due to camp negligence. A year later, two counselors were brutally murdered and more disaster followed. The camp was closed, and the locals renamed it Camp Blood. But on Friday the 13th years later, 7 counselors came fr the camp's reopening. But something goes very wrong as murder and mayhem ensue. The plot is also minimal, basically just the kids having sex and doing stupid things while getting picked off one by one. But Tom Savini is great as the makeup expert, the score is good, and its still always fun watching this one.

 Some of the sequels were okay, but this remains the best in the series. My advice is watch this one and maybe Part 6, those are the best two in the series. Overall one of the best of its kind, a film which today is considered classic, and rightfully so.",1116028800,4,1403,4.384615384615385

237696,3,6300214087,"The first time I saw the original Friday the 13th, I was 14 years old. I watched it before going to bed and was not able to get a single minute of sleep that night! I was literally worried that I would never be able to sleep at night again. The very thought of laying in bed, not knowing who (or what) might be underneath, was terrifying. If you've seen this film, you know the scene that I am referring to.

I think the original Friday the 13th is a vastly under-rated movie. People often bash it for its unheralded cast, mediocre acting, and particularly its ""mindless subject matter."" TV Guide is unbelievably harsh, giving the movie no stars out of a possible five. That is both outrageous and absurd. Clearly someone at TV Guide has a hidden agenda. Produced with a pathetic budget of $700,000 Friday the 13th could not afford a big-name cast, crew, props, and other luxurious that big budget films take for granted. And still, the film delivers and delivers big. Tom Savini's special effects are shocking, gory, and impressive. The musical score adds an ominous, frightening atmosphere and the first-person camera perspective showcases the killer's point-of-view and results in great dramatic irony (jargon for ""the viewer knows what the victim does not"").

Those who say Friday the 13th lacks a plot are either drunk, high, or asleep. Up until the final 15 minutes, the movie remains a mystery as the killer's identity remains unknown. Is it Crazy Ralph? Is it Steve Christie, the new camp owner? When the killer is finally revealed, we discover that there is a very personal and understandable motivation for the murders.

The only real complaint I have with the movie is that the acting at times seems rather wooden and amateurish, but that is what you get with an abysmal budget. Friday the 13th has gone on to become a horror classic, and has been spoofed and imitated countless times since its release in 1980. Although it seems mild by today's standards, in 1980 the movie was chastised as unacceptably violent and gory and was one of the first movies to feature a high body count.

This is one of the best and most influential horror movies ever released, and thus belongs up there with the likes of Psycho, Halloween, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Let's just hope they don't attempt to destroy Friday the 13th's legacy by re-making it like they did Psycho and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",1114300800,4,2398,4.743405275779376

237700,3,6300214087,"How does Friday the 13th copy Halloween?!!! Are you brain damaged? Seriously, how could you even ask that question? First off, after Halloween became a money making machine major studios through out Hollywood began pumping out cheap clones of John Carpenter's masterpiece. Many of these films were set on holidays, some even using the name of the holiday(or pseudo holiday)as the title.(Gee, I wonder where they came up with that idea) Just to name a few, New Years Evil, My Bloody Valentine, April Fools Day. Oh, and what's that other one? Oh yeah, Friday the 13th.
 Aside from the very premise being a complete rip-off, there are technical similarities between the two films. The opening scene of Halloween is a subjective camera shot. During this scene a young girl is killed while we, the viewer, watch through the killer's eyes. Now I ask you, how did Friday the 13th begin? Because I seem to remember watching through the eyes of a killer as they murdered two teenagers who were about to have sex. Hey that reminds me, what was Michael Meyers sister doing right before he killed her? Let us continue, shall we?
After the opening scene in  Halloween, the film jumps ahead 15 years later. After the opening scene in Fri the 13th,  the film jumps ahead approximately 20 years later. The main character in both films is a young woman. Both woman end up being the last person(among their friends)alive and must, alone, try to escape the killer.
 Now I must say, of all the Halloween carbon copies, Friday the 13th is the best one. Though not a great piece of film making, it is highly enjoyable if your in the mood for a mindless slasher film.

The killer is revealed, as a bates-ish type killer, and the film really picks up.  A somewhat surprising end is in store for those who manage to make it clear through the film.  A Twilight Zone-ish tag is added to the end as well.

The main problem this film faces is it's utter cheapness; in writing and budget.

I suppose I should mention Kevin Bacon is in this, but by no means makes the film any more watchable.

It basically jumpstarted the popularity of horror/slasher films. It's one of a number of films that changed horror movies forever. The film is not a copy or ripoff of John Carpenter's Halloween. It's a unique film all it's own. This is also the first horror film to have a very high body count. Exactly 10 people died in the film, the whole premise of this film is extremely frightening to me compared to today's horror films. Here's what the film is about. In 1957, a young boy named Jason drowned at Camp Crystal Lake. In 1958, the teenagers supposedly responsible are murdered by an unknown assailant. The camp closed, but in 1980 it is reopened by Steve Christie, who hires a few teenagers to be councillors. Mayhem happens when each one is murdered one by one by an unknown killer. This unknown killer hides in the woods, and stalks and kills the teens in a systematic manner. The first Friday the 13th film does not have Jason Voorhees in it, but is still scary as hell. The last surviving person eventually discovers who the killer is. It's a woman, Jason Voorhees' mother Pamela Voorhees. She's stopping at nothing to kill every single teenager at the camp. Close to the end of the film, the only survivor which is a girl chops Pamela Voorhees' head off. After she kills her she gets in a boat and sails down the lake. She wakes up the next morning and to her surprise gets attacked by Jason' ghost while in the boat. She soon wakes up in the hospital and realizes it was only nightmare. But the nightmare makes her ponder about the existence of the killer' son. THIS FILM IS A HORROR CLASSIC PERIOD!!",1110067200,,1773,4.492260061919505

237746,4,6300214087,"Ah, The original Friday. It's amazing to know that the machete-wielding killer in a hocky mask originated from a movie that was based around his mother and not him.

A few years before hand a boy named Jason Voorhees drowned in the lake of Camp Crystal Lake. The camp councillors where meant to be watching everyone who was in the water, but they where too busy doing breaststroke of another kind.

Jason Voorhees was said to have drowned in CCL and the camp was shut down. A few years later the camp is about to be re-opened by some new councillors. But something strange is going on, things aren't going right, somebody doesn't want them to open that camp up again.

When Sean Cunningham created this 1980's horror movie classic he chose a cast of unknowns for his independent film. But one of those actors is now well known, perhaps you know him? Kevin Bacon. Also screen veteran Betsy Palmer. But don't expect to see a whole lot of familiar faces like they did with that rip-off F-13th wannabe film ""Scream"", and ""Know what you did last summer"". Sean had the right idea to cast (then) unknown actors to be part of this film so that you can enjoy the film and not concentrate on familiar actors all the time. And they would have had no idea that they where about to make new history in the beginning of one of the greatest horror movie sagas of all time. And the success the film would endure even to this day.

I own the region 4 (Australia) edition of Friday the 13th. And it is distributed by Warner Bros. Not Paramount. And it includes an interesting audio commentary by Sean S.Cunningham, featurette's and some other bonus things. Apart from it having a weird cover instead of the traditional dark black with a white figure on it. I would recommend any F13th fan try to get there hands on that version of F13th instead of the Paramount version that has no bonus features included (not even in the Manhattan box set has the commentary!)",1107561600,,1943,4.511363636363637

237748,5,6300214087,"In 1974, director Tobe Hooper had brought us the frightening, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". In 1978, just four years after ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", John Carpenter, brought us the terrifying, ""Halloween"". Both films may have chilled us all to the bone, but those films did not define the term, ""Slasher Flick"".

  In 1980, director Sean S. Cunningham brought us the infamous, ""Friday The 13th"", the film that had definite potential in defining, ""Slasher Flick"". It was the one horror movie that really made you re-think your camping trip.

  In the summer of 1957, 11-year-old Jason Voorhees (played by Ari Lehman) drowned in the lake, while at Camp Crystal Lake. In the summer of 1958, two counselors, Barry (played by Willie Adams) and Claudette (played by Debra S. Hayes), were brutally slaughtered. Since then, Camp Crystal Lake was shut down, due to the unsolved murders. But on Friday, June 13th, 1980, exactly 22 years after the two murders, Steve Christy (played by Peter Brouwer) has re-opened Camp Crystal Lake, where has hired seven new counselors: Jack Burrell (played by Kevin Bacon), Ned Rubinstein (played by Mark Nelson), Marcie Cunningham (played by Jeannine Taylor), Brenda (played by Laurie Bartram), Bill (played by Harry Crosby), Annie (played by Robbi Morgan), & Alice Hardy (played by Adrienne King).

  Only six of the counselors have arrived at Camp Crystal Lake. Annie is still on her way, but she has come across the anonymous killer, who had killed the two others 22 years ago. Poor Annie didn't have a chance to live the rest of her life.

  Steve Christy goes off on an errands, while the other six continue to get the place in shape for the little kids. But Ned, Jack, Marcie, Brenda, and Bill meet the same fate as Annie, where they are killed by the same anonymous killer, until Alice is the only one left alive. She finds Bill's dead body and runs back to the main cabin, barricading the door. But as she locks all the doors in the cabin, Brenda's dead body is thrown through the kitchen window. Alice runs into the living and sees a jeep pull up. She runs out to meet the driver in the jeep. The driver in the jeep is a woman named Pamela Voorhees. She reveals her true identity as the brutal killer of this whole ordeal. Her motive: the death of her son, Jason Voorhees. She claims the two counselors she murdered in 1958 were the ones that allowed Jason to drown, while they were sleeping together. After a long battle with Mrs. Voorhees, Alice grabs a machete and decapitates Mrs. Voorhees.

Alice, relieved that she has finally stopped the madness, climbs into a canoe and drifts off into the lake. She awakes the next morning to the sound of a police calling out to her. But as she looks up, Jason's rotting corpse jumps up out of the water and pulls Alice underneath the water, but Alice finds herself in the hospital. The sheriff of Crystal Lake asks if Alice remembers anything. She remembers everything, including her dream of Jason pulling her into the water. The sheriff brings to Alice's attention that there was no boy.

  Advice from me to you: Camping does not seem like a good idea right now. But cheer up. Grab your copy of Friday The 13th and enjoy it, until everything dies down at Camp Crystal Lake.",1106524800,2,3260,4.70298769771529
237749,5,6300214087,"Okay, so you've seen the movie in the rental store.  Should you watch it?  I think so.  It is ultimately the start of the next generation of horror.  It starts out with a young boy drowning (in 1957) at the age of 11.  Not too long after that, someone starts the most shocking set of murders ever to be remembered.

The assailant, whom is either good old Jason Voorhees himself or someone else, discovers there is another group of teens (camp counselors, the people responsible for Jason's death) inhabiting Camp Crystal Lake.  As you can probably guess, they are dispatched in extremely gory, cruel methods, until Alice (played by Adrienne King) is the only one left.  She then discovers Pamela Voorhees, Jason's mom.  She seems friendly enough to be anyone's mom, until we see the leatherman knife hidden behind her shirt.

Things start going downhill from there, especially with the ending, which repeats itself in the second and third parts, just to give Jason a chance to unmask himself and breathe in some fresh air.  Overall, though, this series combined with Halloween (created by John Carpenter and still influencing hundreds) is a jam-packed ride into the true meaning of terror.",1104796800,2,1189,4.895
237750,5,6300214087,"I can't believe some of the reviews below that give this movie 1 or 2 stars?!! I can only guess they came from younger viewers who only came to this movie after several of the sequels had been made. If you enjoy the horror movies of today; ""Scream"", ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""Saw"" then you have to give credit to ""Friday the 13th"" for starting that. When the original ""Friday the 13th"" came out my brother and I went to see it like 5 times, it was so different from almost all of the other horror films at the time. Sure it was a slasher like ""Halloween"", but it was also a mystery. We had no clue who the killer was, it could have been anyone, and with ""Halloween"" you knew within 5 minutes who the killer was. I saw a review that stated ""Friday the 13th didn't have a ""chase"" scene, I am not sure what movie that review is talking about as the last fifteen minutes plus of this movie is one long, chilling ""chase"" scene. The special effects by Tom Savini still hold up well today, and like ""Halloween"", the music of this film really sets the mood and tone of the film. If you are only familiar with the sequels and the hockey-masked figure of Jason when it comes to ""Friday the 13th"" you are doing yourself a huge injustice, and missing one of the best films of the series by skipping the original. But do yourself a favor, instead of buying the individual DVD's, spend the extra bucks on the box set now available, for this and the 7 Paramount sequels that followed.

237801,5,6300214087,"If you're going to fully appreciate ""Friday The 13th"" (I'm referring to the original film, not the whole series, though the exact same statement could be made there as well)you're going to have to watch it more than once.  For the first time - assuming you haven't already seen it, though if you have you can imagine you haven't - forget everything you know or think you know about the film and the series from the commercials, the merchandising, the ""Nightmare"" crossover, the hockey mask (it wasn't in any of the original trailers for the movie), the cover art for the sequels, and Especially from the naysayers, and watch the show as if you have no foreknowledge of the film at all - as if you don't know for sure there are any sequels coming - (I doubt there'll be many people reading this who haven't seen at least a couple of the chapters, but if there is I'd love to be in your position - to be able to start the whole series over again Truly without knowing what's coming).  Take it as what it's described as originally - the story of a summer camp re-opening more than 20 years after a little boy named Jason drowned, and the murder of 2 camp counsellors.  Don't assume it's necessarily going to fit the slasher mold, don't assume it's necessarily going to fit the ghost story mold, just watch and let it unfold.

  Then, after a time - weeks, years, whatever, re-watch it after you've seen the sequels; preferably all of them, including ""Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday"" and ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" (I don't consider ""Jason X"" part of the series, I consider it a spoof of the series.  I'm not trying to be mean; it's glaringly obvious it was intended as self-parody, though portions of it have some entertainment value.  If you're a big fan of the ""Scream"" movies, the ""Scary Movie"" series, and so on you'd probably enjoy ""Jason X"" a lot more than I did; I'd recommend it to these fans more than to fans of the other ""Friday""s, ""Halloween"" and so on) though it could be done after only seeing certain key ones (or, if you're as big a fan of the series as I am, rewatch it after some of the sequels (say 2-7) and then again way later after ""FVJ"").

  Because once you've seen them all, you see things in the rewatches of previous chapters in new lights and from new angles.  There's far more running under the surface of these movies than they'll ever be given credit for.  Maybe part of it is a Rorshach effect, where what you see in the inkblot is all in the individual's own interpretation and has nothing to do with what the guy blotting the page was thinking about at the time, because I really can't explain how all these subcurrents could have been planned all along given that most of the films have had different writers, directors, etc.  But I can say I see them there.

  I can't really say what they are because that would involve giving out spoilers, not only to this first ""Friday The 13th"" and not only major spoilers, but little ones in various chapters all the way to the latest (as a sidenote, the only installment of the franchise - ""Jason X"" excluded - that doesn't fit into my view of subcurrents and adding slightly askew angles to what has come before, is ""Part VIII"", which contains what seem to me to be mistakes rather than new points, particularly in regards to the time frame).  I can say one thing that doesn't really give anything away - sometimes when I've watched it, I've thought I could faintly hear things in the wind that other times were absent.  Rorscach again?  Or creating a really effective atmosphere that makes your mind play tricks on you?  Anyway, I find that freaky - a lot more so than if they were there all the time.

  Now some, even if they really like the movie, may have no desire to go on with the whole series.  Some films are admittedly better left complete and un-sequelized, like ""Ghost"", ""Dead Again"", ""Titanic"", and even though I really looked forward to ""Book Of Shadows"" at the time and it wasn't an awful movie, I think I might include ""The Blair Witch Project"" as a no-sequels-required movie.  But ""Friday The 13th"" isn't one of them.  I would at the very least urge you to see ""Part 2"" if you liked the first one at all, because to me these 2 form two halves of a complete beginning to the rest of the series (or 2 halves of a single whole, if you prefer).  ""Friday"" without ""Part 2"" would seem as incomplete to me as if ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" had ended the saga without ""Return Of The Jedi"", with all the loose endings forever dangling.  Actually, my full recommedation is the whole series, because while there are some chapters out there that are substantially lesser than others, the whole series remains at least good, with some truly awesome chapters in there.

  Bottom line: ""Friday The 13th"" is essential viewing for horror fans, whether or not you're up (or way up) for the whole gamut of sequels.",1096243200,,4899,4.4696629213483146
237812,4,6300214087,"In 1980 Paramount Pictures and Sean S. Cunningham released a B-film ""splatter"" (less scare and more brutal killing and blood) flick that was basically supposed to emmulate Halloween. They didn't quite get the aesthetic properties of Carpenter's Halloween (poor use of noir and the music didn't even compare to Carpenter's Halloween theme in setting the mood), however it did give birth to the largest horror franchise ever! Many people criticize the Friday The 13th Series for lacking in horror compared to Nightmare and Halloween, however I'm a large fan of ""splatter"" and I feel it delivers where these other franchises fail.

 The plot runs a pretty natural course, however those who have seen the film know of the little ""twist"" at the end. In 1957, Jason Voorhies drowned at the age of 12 at Camp Crystal Lake. Unfortunately this was due to the fact that the couselors were all having sex and not watching him (boy I wish I'd worked there when I was 17!). In an act of revenge, two counselors were murdered in a barn and the camp was closed down. Now, 10 years later, Bill Christy has decided to re-open Camp Crystal Lake in spite of all the rumors that it has a ""death curse"". We get to see this curse personified within the first fifteen minutes of the film when the camp's new cook is killed while hitchhiking just a few miles outside of Camp Crystal Lake. From this point on it's nothing but teenagers getting hacked to death one by one until, of course, there's only one left standing to fight the killer.

 This movie is definitely dated, if not because eighteen year olds being sexually charged seems rare to these characters, then it's because a game of strip monopoly doesn't even make it past shirts! The deaths are relatively inventive and the gore isn't bad, especially for 1980 when it must have SHOCKED moviegoers. Stars include a young Kevin Bacon as Counselor Jack and the infamous Betsy Palmer in her most credited role (for those who haven't seen it, you'll know her when you see her)! All in all I find this to be better than Craven's Nightmare and Carpenter's Halloween series simply because I'm more a ""splatter"" fan and all those like me will definitely agree!

 As far as the DVD goes, it may seem simple compared to the loaded-with-crap-you-don't-need extras of today, but it does give us what we should expect from this medium. The picture is definitely cleaned up (go rent the original on VHS and you'll see EXACTLY what I mean) as well as the sound. Even though the sound is only in 2.0 surround, the original wasn't presented in 5.1 in the theatres and I didn't expect Paramount to go out of its way and create a new track. The only features is a theatrical trailer, however fans and collectors do appreciate it. There is some debate as to whether or not Jack's death scene and the final scene are slightly extended, but all in all it doesn't change much and is definitely not the ""uncut"" version I've heard of (however Paramount claims this version is lost). Ultimately it does do what DVD was intended for, enhance viewing and restore originals with the benefits of digital technology.

 Any fans of the horror genre should definitely consider picking up this movie as it's not only a classic, but a great beginning to the slasher trend of the 80s. I know there's a Jason boxed set coming out, however since I know it's two movies per disc and it WON'T have a different version, you may want to consider purchasing separately to at least give each movie its own disc. If you are interested, though, feel free to read my review on the set as a whole.",1091664000,,3584,4.6242138364779874

237814,3,6300214087,"The movie that started it all! A low budget film that Sean S. Cunningham made to earn some quick bucks turned into one of the biggest horror franchises today. Many (including the person that wrote the film, Victor Miller) consider this to be the best installment of the series, though I personally think otherwise.

The movie was originally released in 1980, so it's obviously a bit dated when you watch it now. Most of the movie takes place at night during a thunderstorm, so it's very hard to see what is going on sometimes. The gore wasn't over-the-top and there was nearly no nudity (I think all we get is a quick peak at a nipple if you look hard enough). The store was an original one for it's time. Steve Christy has been trying to open camp Crystal Lake for a long time, despite the problems it's had in the past (a young boy drowning in '57, two murders in '58, and several other problems with arsony and the water). After a hard day of work the teenage councelors settle in only to end up in the worst night of their lives.

If it weren't for a few problems, this movie would be a lot more enjoyable. For one thing, the bad lighting effects make it hard to make out what's going on. Several logic errors plaque the movie, and the yellow lightning is just innexcuseable. It does, however, introduce the series well and also show the signifigance of the machete in the series (Jason's favorite weapon).

It's not just kill, kill, kill from beggeinng to end like the sequels are. It actually has some substance to it. Yet it is not the ""funnest"" of the series. The sequels are more enjoyable to watch.

237820,3,6300214087,"Despite its popularity, FRIDAY THE 13TH still got a lot of flak from critics, and I must say they make a lot of good points against the movie. Okay, I won't go so far as critic Roger Ebert did when he said the film was ""beneath contempt""---sure, compared to its superior predecessor HALLOWEEN, FRIDAY THE 13TH really is exploitation hackwork, but it isn't totally horrible as a horror flick. Director Sean S. Cunningham at the very least has a decent sense of how to create a tense atmosphere that gives the movie more class than it deserves---he isn't necessarily just interested in the next murder, like some lesser directors might be. It's too bad, though, that Cunningham knows very little about building suspense, relying instead on gruesome cheap shocks to make an effect. And he shows almost no sense of style---a stark contrast to John Carpenter, for whom style was just about everything in HALLOWEEN. In addition to all that, the film's attempt at being some kind of mystery totally fails, since the eventual solution to it is so out-of-left-field (not like it really matters anyway, right?).
Tom Savini's notorious gore effects in this one are admittedly kinda cool, though---and, in its own way, groundbreaking. In the film's own way, too, FRIDAY THE 13TH is groundbreaking, but for the wrong reason: it inspired a slew of imitators in the '80s that tried to make even more outrageously violent and bloody slasher flicks, where gore was everything and true horror was zero. FRIDAY THE 13TH might not have been ""beneath contempt,"" but the bloody-slasher-flick subgenre it helped popularize sure became so. Still, on its own, FRIDAY THE 13TH is a sometimes decent but generally mediocre slasher flick.",1086220800,,1710,4.9825174825174825
237881,3,6300214087,"Director:  Sean S. Cunningham
Cast:  Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Kevin Bacon.
Running Time:  95 minutes.
Rated R for violence, gore, language, and mild sexual situations.
One of the more influential slasher films of all time, ""Friday the 13th"" was one of the few in the series that was moderately scary, used specific camera positioning and foreground for its scares, and possessed a fairly intelligent script.  A group of camp counselors are looking forward to their work at Crystal Lake campsite, only to hear the warnings from townies that they are in severe danger and that they should leave immediately.  Ignoring these threats, the teenagers live life as if they are no worries.
Their attitudes change when a maniac killer starts to knock off all of the counselors, each in a gory fashion one-by-one.  Adrienne King is the main scream queen, running around the camp finding dead bodies all over and finally encountering the killer and learns the truth of the systematic murder spree.  Excellent special effects by master Tom Savini and a tense, dramatic musical score, yet the performances are fairly laughable and the plot gets old quickly (which obviously means they should make nine more sequels!).  The final scene is absolutely terrifying!  Not one of the best, but still important to the genre.",1085356800,,1321,5.078703703703703

Well, for starters, don't believe any of the hype about the movie. Yes, it was probably scary compared to the movies of it's time. But now a days, it's a boring flick, with poor murder scenes, and unrealistic blood/injuries.
Basically, Camp 'Blood' is re-opening, and so on Friday the 13th, the counselors get murdered one by one. It's a predicatable plot, up to who the murderor is.
The only thing it really has going for it is the basic interest of who gets murdered when. Don't get me wrong. If I was reviewing this movie when it first came out, it might have received 5 stars. But compared with the films of today, it's a low-throttled slasher film, only worth watching when you're bored.

It is a very good movie that begins with 2 counselors in 1958 being killed then cut to credits. That scene was chilling alone. Then a character named Annie gets screen time that makes it seem she will be the heroine or survivor. She is trying to get a ride to Camp where she will be a cook. She hitches a ride with the wrong person. She is chased into the wods and killed. Then we see all the counselors at camp. Bill, Alice, Brenda, Jack, Marcie, and Ned with their boss Steve who leaves for town. Then systematically most are killed Ned is Knifed then Jack is arrowed then Marcie is stalked in a bathroom where she is axed.  Then Brenda is killed offscreen. Leaving Alice and Bill at camp.....ALONE. Then Steve comes Back but is you guessed it stabbed. The lights go out so Bill goes to the generator. Alice makes coffee and is alone she waits then gooes to look for Bill. She finds him dead. Arrowed to a door.
Alice is freaking out when a body is thrown through the window. Then Mrs Voorhess ""an old friend of the Christy's"" comes.

She is revealed as the killer. She is angry that her son drown in 57 so she is taking revenge on all of the counselors and after a suspenseful chase after Alice.

And it was an original at the time of it's release. And it keeps you guessing because it doesn't reveil who the killer is until the end. Let's take a look-see. We've got seven attractive councelors heading up to Camp crystal lake or camp blood as the locals in the nearby town prefer to call it. One by one they get the slice..or the axe..or the arrow through the neck in Jack's (Kevin Bacon's) case. But that's the way it is. The killer is reveiled to be....(and sorry to be a spoiler if by any chance you didn't know)...Mrs. Pamala Voorhees. Her motive? Years ago she worked as a cook in the same camp and her son Jason drowned in the lake coz the councelors who were supposed to be keeping an eye on him were getting it on instead, a huge no-no. So basicly Mrs. Voorhees never got over the loss of her son. And there it is. Perhaps the thing I like most about this movie-it's so sad! I mean even if mother and son are a pair of homicidle maniacs. But it's all out of love awww[...] think it's sweet in a weird, twisted kind of way, and it adds an emotional streak to this horror movie. This is something that all the critics manage to overlook,but they are being superficial. Now gorehounds shouldn't overlook this either,there's stabbing,slashing,spearing,chopping-the whole deal. So all up Friday the 13th really does have something in it for everyone,and may I just say that the final scare at the end is one of if not the best scare ever.

But, unknown to the group someone or something is slowly hunting them & like the ten little indians, one by one the counselers are quietly dispatched.

Much like ""Jaws"", ""Friday the 13th"" taps into the primal instinct within us all. The omnious, vulnerable feeling of being alone & yet having the feeling of someone watching your every move. After almost 25 years, the film remains a jolting, jump out of your seat scare-fest that will make you think twice before going into the woods alone, or into the woods ever again for that matter!

Cashing in on the ""Halloween"" craze, ""Paramount Pictures"" bought the rights to the film & released ""Friday the 13th"" back in 1980. The studio, thinking the film would flop, just wanted a quick payday & nothing more to do with the film. But the studio's plan backfired & ""Friday the 13th"" became a big hit (approx. 40 million dollars at the box office & becoming one of the top 20 grossers of 1980) as well as, a major embarassment for the studio (after the films release talk shows, newspapers, & activist groups attacked the film for its raw, brutal violence in the film). Thats why there are no major special features, deleted scenes, cast interviews, etc. ""Paramount"" is still embarassed by the success of this series (its the black sheep series of the studio). The DVD is a barebones affair with 2.0 Dolby Digital, & a trailer for a special feature.

237921,4,6300214087,"One of the longest-running horror film series began with this gory shocker from director Sean S. Cunningham, who had previously produced Wes Craven's classic Last House on the Left. Entrepreneur Steve Christie (Peter Brouwer) re-opens Camp Crystal Lake after many years during which it has been cursed by murders and bad luck. The young and nubile counselors all begin to die extremely bloody deaths at the hands of an unseen killer during a rainstorm which isolates the camp. A woman is chopped in the face with an axe, another has her throat sliced in amazingly gruesome fashion, a male counselor (Harry Crosby) is pinned to a door with arrows, and a young Kevin Bacon has an arrow shoved through his throat from below a bed. Victor Miller's script is not particularly impressive, but Cunningham's tense direction, and some remarkable special-effects by acclaimed makeup artist Tom Savini are enough to make it worthwhile. 1950s quiz-show regular Betsy Palmer appears as the cook whose son Jason (Ari Lehman) drowned 25 years earlier while neglected by romancing counselors. Palmer was reportedly cast because she was willing to drive her own car to and from the set. Trivia buffs should note the decapitation scene near the end, in which the female killer exhibits rather hirsute hands clutching at the air. The hands belong to Savini's assistant, Taso N. Stavrakis.

FRIDAY THE 13TH is the classic original in what has become a monotonous stream of inferior sequels (10 to date and counting). Yes, there is a ""body count"", but at least there's a good, creepy story to carry the carnage! Long before there was a mindless, invincible stalker and his 20+ year murder spree, there was the REASON for it all. In this first movie, we get the actual motive for all that hideous rage and it's gory result. This is a tale of vengeance fueled by insanity. Yes, we get to see WHO is killing the new arrivals at Crystal Lake. More importantly, in this one we get the answer to WHY they are dying. Yes, there is a Jason Vorhees. However, there is someone else who is equally frightening. Someone who will stop at nothing in order to exact revenge. This person is bitterness incarnate, compelled to destroy in order to feed the inner demon. To get ""justice"" for something that cannot be made right.

The whole story about Jason is that one day he went swimming but since the counselers were making out and he couldn't swim he drowned and Mrs. Voorhees really never got over that.

237939,5,6300214087,"This film, the first in a very long (and not always entirely successful) franchise introduces us to the ""mother"" of all slasher films, the original, and arguably best, ""Friday the 13th.""
By now, everyone knows the premise of this film.  Jason Voorhees, a boy attending Camp Crystal Lake one summer, drowns when the camp counselors ignore his cries for help due to their sexual indiscretions.  Exacting revenge for his death, a faceless killer stalks the camp, taking out counselors in various, horrible ways in a bloodbath that would give all movie makers a new standard to beat in future slasher films.  It isn't until the end of the movie that we learn that the killer is none other than Jason Voorhee's mother (GASP!!) and that she has gone crazy after her son's death.
Following in the success of films like Halloween and Psycho, Friday the 13th worked well because its ""camp"" was balanced with so many moments of genuine suspense that it kept audiences on the edge of their seats.  Relatively tame by the standards of today's films, this movie still offers up plenty of screams and moments of genuine fright, combined with enough teenage sexuality to keep every teenager watching the film engaged for the duration of the film.
The movie exploits the notion that immorality will get you killed.  It is a concept that has long played in the horror genre and become a staple of the industry as a whole.  Even horror ""spoof"" movies like ""Scream"" exploit the films premise that sex and drugs will serve as a calling card for the killer to get you.
For fans of the series, this is the only film in which Jason (who becomes the killer in all 10 sequels (including Jason VS. Freddy) is not the serial killer.  Of course, the fans may know that, but for anyone who doesn't, don't go looking for the infamous hockey mask wearing killer to make any appearance.  On the otherhand, look for Hollywood A-list actors who make an appearance in this film (most notably Kevin Bacon, who made his debut in this movie).
Overall, Friday the 13th is a fun, scary movie that will transport the viewer to a different era in horror movie camp...the one they call ""Crystal Lake"".

237975,5,6300214087,"Here's where it all began. True, future Jason flicks had almost nothing to do with the original story, but this is where the legend began. Jason Voorhees, a mongoloid boy drowns in Crystal Lake during the summer of 1957. In 1958, Jason's mother kills two camp counselors just when they are about to have sex. Then we are told there were a series of fires that started around the camp, but no one knew who was responsible.
Fast forward to the `present day', June 13. The Camp is going to reopen, but the residents have already renamed the place Camp Blood. The camp counselors assemble and are preparing to get the camp ready for the summer's youngsters. Naturally there first night there, there is a terrible rain storm (It's gonna blow through here like a son of a gun!). One by one the counselors are killed off until only Amy remains. In the end she confronts and kills Mrs. Voorhees by decapitating her with a machete. Guess that's why the machete is Jason's favorite weapon of choice.
The final scene in the boat made everyone jump who saw this film for the first time and wasn't expecting it. To see young Jason leap out and grab Amy from behind is still to this day one of the most disturbing films ever shot.
This is not one of the goriest Jason films by far, but it had some good kills. One counselor who never even reaches the camp gets her throat slit convincingly as she leans against a tree. Kevin Bacon had the best kill with a spear coming up through his neck. His girlfriend got a nice little axe to the head too. Two deaths aren't even shown but we see the bodies later. The head counselor gets stabbed through the stomach, but we only see his facial expression. The great scene of Mrs. Voorhees getting her head cut off is great too. Not only does it look so real, but the way the slow motion starts and her hands try to reach where her head once were is very disturbing. A great film and a good history lesson for those who have no idea how the whole `Jason' thing started.",1064707200,2,1992,4.3719676549865225

Extras are limited to a trailer and an alternate language. Despite the availability of space on the disc, they chose to use a high compression rate. This is really only noticable if you zoom, though. Also, an original film flaw about 46 minutes in is still present. This consists of a black line on the left side of the image that appears for about 10 seconds.

238012,3,6300214087,"Hard to beleive this movie came out almost a quarter of a century ago.  Friday the 13th came out in 1980, the same year as The Fog, The Shining, He Knows You're Alone, Motel Hell, Mother's Day, and Prom Night.  I remember this because my friends and I would pour over various horror rags, Fangoria and such, and talk about all the movies we wanted to see, and Friday the 13th was near the top of all our lists.
Although this movie has lost a little of it's intensity from previous viewings, it's still a great little movie (or big movie if you look at all the sequels it spawned).  It's the story of a bunch of teenagers going to work at a summer camp that had been closed down for a number of years and dubbed 'Camp Blood' by local residents.  Like 20 years prior, there had been a couple of grisly murders, and subsequent fires and such, but no one was ever caught or charged with the crimes.  The teenagers are hired to help fix the camp up, and get it ready to open for the summer.  Throughout the beginning of the movie, the onminus threat of evil slowly rises.  One of my favorite scenes is when the local loon named Crazy Ralph warns one girl on her way to the camp.  ""You're doooomed!  Doooomed!""  The local residents pass him off as crazy, but they all have reservations about the camp re-opening.
Well, the murders begin, one by one, but so does the mystery.  Who is doing the killing?  And why?  Watch for a young Kevin Bacon to get it in a particularly nasty way.  And as for Ned, played by Mark Nelson, I can't say I was sorry to see him go, as he was played as the 'funny' guy, but just came off as really annoying.  And it seemed odd to me that he was one of the first to get killed, but no one seemed to miss him until much later in the movie.  Oh well...  All this leads up to the climatic surpise ending where we find out who the killer is and why.  But is it the end?  What I really liked about this movie was the ending, and how it was left open.  Did Alice dream about what happened on the lake or did it really happen?  The sequels kind of spoiled this haunting question, and so I avoid them, as this is the best in the series.  By the way, I'm not a big fan of slasher movies, but I feel this one, like the original Halloween movie, had more to offer in not only horror, but mystery and suspense, unlike their respective sequels which just became all about the body count.",1058832000,2,2395,4.1496746203904555

238014,3,6300214087,"I remember seeing F13 (and its sequels) when I was very young. It scared me to death (no pun intended). Now that I am old enough to legally see this movie, I can't believe that this was once scary to me.
This movie is no masterpiece, since it's basically a Halloween imitator. However, it has Halloween beat as far as the kills are concerned. (My favorites being an axe to the face, and Kevin Bacon getting an arrow through the neck) Sure, we don't see Jason, with hockey mask, doing his thing, but the film is still decent.
The original F13 is the best in the series, since it established the basic formula used in its sequels. I don't find the movie as scary as the first time I watched it, years ago. However, it's still fun to watch(especially with a crowd), if only for the gruesome, and creative murder sequences. I also can't forget about the T & A, although I can say that some of the later installments have more in that department.
To me, F13 is a softcore porn flick with a homicidal maniac. It doesn't deserve to be compared with the likes of Citizen Kane and Casablanca, that's not the point. It's just entertainment and a good way to spend time. It still works as a guilty pleasure most of the time. Kind of like ""real"" porn.",1056326400,2,1239,4.367965367965368

JASON VORHEES! Even though Jason isn't in the first one, his mother creeped me out and I didn't want to spend a weekend in the woods with my family because of these films. Everything is cool about the F13 series. The story, the characters, the style of killings, and the music (In the first 4 films only for the music).
Friday the 13th is all about revenge. A boy named Jason Vorhees went to Camp Crystal Lake. One day, as Jason was swimming in the lake, he started to drown and none of the councelors saved him. Years later, a group of teens go to Camp Crystal Lake for a little fun. But, unbeknownst to them, Jason's mother is lurking around in the woods, watching their every move and soon killing them off. Friday the 13th parts 1-4 are the only good ones in the series. Everything after that is ridiculous and old and not scary at all. Well, none of them are really scary, except for this one.

238017,3,6300214087,"Back In 1980, Friday The 13th made it's debut to the bigscreen. Till this day it is one of the best original horror movies out there. It is clearly the best movie in the whole entire series. Ofcourse at this point there are a total of ten Friday the 13th movies. After all, this is the one that started it all. It had a simple story of counselers at crystal lake getting killed twenty years before it reopened only to see more deaths. As we all should know the killer in this movie was Mrs. Vorhees as she was getting revenge on horny teens who were too busy making love while her son Jason was drownining twenty years back. This time she shows her rage against teens killing one by one. At the end she tries to kill one last teenager but fails to due so ,and gets her head chopped off at the end of the movie. This then sets up Part II whwere Jason ofcourse saw his mother's death while in the lake. The movie had a creepy atmosphere where teens were alone in the middle of the woods, it got dark, it was raining and there car would not start. The movie is clearly entertaing but it makes me ask would the whole friday the 13th series exist without John Carpenter's Halloween Classic in 1978. I don't mean to dissapoint all Jason fans but I truely belive the answer is no. No Horror movie could beat Halloween. That was the movie that started the whole slasher genre. Michael Myers was the first slasher icon to the bigscreen making Halloween the most influential horror movie ever. After Michael Audrey Myers in Halloween, we all learned about Jason Vorhees, Freddy Krueger, Pinhead, and Chucky,etc. It can be said series wise that Fiday the 13th is the best as a whole series. Part II was a respectable follow up from part one as we oficially saw Jason Vorhees but not with the hockey mask, but a potatoe sack. In Part III we see Jason with the Hockey mask which was also was a respectable sequel as well as part four, the final chapter involving Tommy Jarvis's encounter with Jason. In some ways I feel Part four which was called the final chapter really should have been the end to the never ending series. After part 4, the terrible part five came which ofcourse had a copycat killer. Part 6 was pointless as a lighting bolt wakes up jason and he kills teens once more.  With That Being said, part 6 was still the best seuquel with part four not too far behind. part VII was kind of dumb where jason fights with a girl with pyschic powers. Part 8 was also pretty dumb and pointless as jason comes to the big apple. Part 9 which again was supposed to be last was not scary and disapoiting. As for latest installment, Jason was disgusting and totally pointless. I really thought the whole franchise went somewhat downhill after part Four. Part 2,3,4 were respectable because they had people in the middle of the woods geting stalked by jason. However, the first four movies were all he same old thing with teens having sex in the woods and then getting killed.  Here's the overall analysis, Best movie in Series: Part 1, Best Sequel: Part 6 (With part 4 right on it's tail), most underated: Part II, most overated: Part 9, worst of series: part 5( With part 8 right behind).  As for part 7,it is better than Part 5,8 and 9 but not the rest. If you want to get intersted in the Friday the 13th series the original is the one see as it won't dissapoint. Anyone who would like to see the sequels certainly could if they would like that is. In the history of horror movies, Friday the 13th is one of the best ever. Sean Cunningham directed was creppy in some ways. Steve Miner who produced part 1 and directed Part 2 and 3 also put a little punch to series. Ofcourse Miner is the one who decided to go with the hockey mask. As far as freddey vs. Jason coming up in August 2003, I think the winner should go to Haddonfiled and find Michael Myers if they can, and give Myers a piece of the pie because if it weren't for Myers those two would not be created. As I said before Friday the 13th is a true horror classic along with some of the other's like The Shining(1980), The Excorcist(1973), Texas Chain saw Massacre(1974), Physcho(1960), Nightmare On Elmstreet(1984), Hellraiser(1987), Child's Play(1988) and Halloween (1978). If you want really want to get into horror movies, Friday The 13th is a not a bad chioce to start, but for the ultimate thrill ride, no horror movie can beat John Carpenter's Hallowen.",1054944000,,4410,4.42189421894219

238058,5,6300214087,"FRIDAY THE 13TH was quite a landmark in the world of horror.  Not only did it begin the infamous legacy of the unstoppable Jason Voorhees, but it also (along with HALLOWEEN) opened the door to more than a decade's worth of imitators.
This is the 2nd scariest FRIDAY THE 13TH of all ten flicks.  It would be the scariest, but Rob Hedden's obssession w/""pushing the limits"" terror and suspense of FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII:...  This one is pretty scary because the viewer doesn't know what the heck is going on.  There is a killer, but who is it?  And why?  After 20 years, pretty much all horror fans know, but it is still very terrifying to watch.  It also takes place in the middle of nowhere, and that is a very good element of horror. ...
One of the best things about this movie, and one of my favorite elements, is the score!  Harry Manfredini wrote what, 16 years later, became my absolute ultimate favorite film score ever!  Some call it a rip-off of Bernard Herrmann's score to PSYCHO, but they are dead wrong!  This score is slightly reminiscent of PSYCHO in some places, but it has far more elements and is far more chilling!  Now all it needs is a decent release...
For those that want to know about the premise itself...
In 1958, two Camp Crystal Lake counselors are murdered.  After a couple more unfortunate incidences, the camp is shut down.  Then comes Friday, June 13th, 1980.  Steve Christy opens spends 25 thou reopening up the camp w/ seven young counselors.  Little do they know the mysterious killer still lurks.  One by one, they are murdered.  Nobody finds out what is going on until there is only one counselor left.  Where is everybody?  They're all dead!  It is time for a showdown between the killer and the remaining counselor, after we find out who this person is as well as their motive.  For those that like really gory deaths, this one has them (including a decapitation which they were lucky to get away with back then), and this film is also a treat to those who love mystery/thrillers/""what the heck's going on?"" type movies.  It may not be the most original movie in the world, but is a very satisfying watch for those that like true terror.",1043539200,,2177,4.528205128205128
238059,3,6300214087,"Widely renowned as being, along with John Carpenter's Halloween, the movie that spawned not only a seemingly endless franchise (check out the recent Jason X) but also popularised the horror movie during the 80's.  Of course, it's a near splatter-fest which manages to incorporate just about every clich that the horror genre has become famous for.  Based around Camp Crystal after it's re-opened after a couple of gruesome murders a few years ago, it's not long before young attractive counsellors are being punished for having sex or going outside to 'investigate'.  Right up to the virginal survivor this is horror clich at its peak, but admitedly enjoyable for the obvious fun the director has with it all.
It's perhaps strange that this of all horror movies of the 80's is still regarded as a classic piece, because there's absolutely nothing here that's new.  Even the death scenes leave a lot to the imagination rather than showing all-out gore.  Certainly it's nothing special amid the other films that are exactly like it, although the mythos built around it all will definitely keep you entertained.  The best scenes are probably towards the end when Mrs Vorhees is revealed as the real killer, whispering 'Kill her.  Kill her Mommy!' before running off after the girl who runs into the wood rather than to the nearest vehicle.  The end of Mrs Vorhees may induce laughs rather than scares (watch out for her hands still clasping and unclasping after she's been decapitated in slow-motion).  Even so, the conclusion is genuinely shocking, and there's plenty of fun to be had in this kind of film, if not only to pick out how many clichs of the genre you can see.  Also there's a young Kevin Bacon cast as the camp's local hunk, who also is on the receiving end of the movie's most imaginative death.  There's also one particularly annoying perky girl who, once she's hitched a ride with the serial killer, will have you cheering that her end is near.",1042761600,,1958,4.8149253731343284

238085,5,6300214087,"Friday the 13th is my favorite horror movie series ever.  Although the series has gone in a wierd direction due to its latest film ""Jason X"", I really did love this first one and alot of the others that came.  The whole franchise pretty much expresses the creepiness that could happen to u when your all alone in the woods.  Anyway here is the plot.
Back in 1958 at Camp Chrystal Lake, two camp counselors who were probobly on the verge of having sex were interrupted and killed.  Many yrs later the camp has reopened but it seems that the CCL (Camp Chrystal Lake) has gotten a name for itself ""Camp Blood"".  It also seems that the murder of the 2 counselors wasn't just the only thing that has happened to that place.  Only a year before the counselors' murder a little boy had drowned in a lake, and not only that other attempts to reopen the camp were cancelled due to forest fire and the lake being poluted.  Not only that, the guy who did reopen the camp had fix up the place for a whole year just so it can be suitable for people to stay at.  The main point of the story is that the new counselors at CCL are being stalked by psycho and killing them off one by one.  The movie is sort of like a spinn off of Halloween except it takes place in the woods and it is more gory.  This movie brought to us some of the best special effect scenes ever like a young Kevin Bacon having an arrow bulge out of his throat.  I'm probobly one of the few people who enjoyed this movie moe then Hallowwen and A Nightmare on Elm Street.  Although it is wierd that the killer wasn't at all who you would expect- A women probobly in her 50's.  It is still fun to watch.  This definetly the perfect film to watch at night.  I highly recommend this and parts 2,3,IV,VI,VII and for the hell of it Jason X cuz I thought it was good although it is entirely a very different movie compared to this one.",1040083200,,1882,4.174515235457064
238086,4,6300214087,"The always enchanting saga of Jason Voorhees begins here.  Following the success of 1978's Halloween, Paramount decided they could one up that fil by releasing they're own slasher, thus Friday the 13th.  The minimal storyline (then again Halloween really didn;t have much of a story either but it more than worked) is a group of horny teenagers (are there any other types of teens?) decide to stay at Crystal Lake, a camp closed twenty years earlier due to the deaths of two counselors.  One by one the teens get picked off by a slashing murderer until finally only one is left.  If you've never seen any Friday the 13th movie, then start here.  Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the jock of the group who ends up getting killed in one of the most creative ways in any slasher film.",1038614400,4,780,4.50354609929078
238087,3,6300214087,"I had always heard and thuoght Friday the 13th was one of the definite horror movies of the 80s, much like Nightmare on Elm Street and the such. After finally seeing it, I only half agree with that statement. I did not enjoy F13 like I thought I would. Perhaps it has something to do with me seeing all of the sequels (minus part 2) before actually seeing where they stemmed from. The sequels all set up plenty of gore and hokey suspense while F13 wasn't all about the chase scenes and surplus gore. I'm guessing it went more the way that Halloween did with the subtle horror and murderer's POV shots.
 There are qualities that I did like about Friday the 13th. To begin with, it drew the backstory of the whole series, and is a serious horror movie (Unlike most of the sequels). The acting is average, and the characters are well developed before we see them (or don't see) killed. Kudos to Adrienne King and the shortly seen yet very effective performance of Betsy Palmer. Sean Cunningham's use of POV shots were great and helped set up plenty of tension and suspense in the film. The use of rain and the dark was good, and gave the film that really good ""camp"" feel. Tom Savini's makeup effects are put to good use, but it's a shame we're always only briefly shown what he has done.
 What's a big shame is Paramount is so noncaring to its consumers that it only provides us with the trailer for the film. I don't mean to be so demanding, but there's so much stuff they could add to the Friday the 13th DVDs, and they don't bother to. Paramount, you need to listen to fans.
 Friday the 13th fairs well as a horror movie, in my opinion. It was breakthrough in its time, and has gone down as a classic. Over millions of fans can't be wrong.",1036627200,4,1740,4.331288343558282
238088,1,6300214087,"I caught this on cable last night. My intro to the series was Part 3, which I saw when I was 12 (in 1983). I of course loved that one back then (haven't seen it since). I saw part of the first one many years ago, but wasn't paying much attention. But seeing it as an adult--boy, is it bad! It's FAR from being suspenseful, let alone scary. It is completely devoid of suspense or creativity. And when we finally do see who the killer is, it becomes downright hilarious! Come on, are we to be scared to watch a contemporary 50-something woman in a nice sweater and makeup (and hairspray) chasing around the final girl (who we of course knew, a la ""Halloween"", would survive). Their catfights are the stuff of comedy, not horror. I mean this woman looks like your best friend's mother (or grandmother), all dolled up to go out and have a special dinner at the local Wag's cafeteria. And to make things worse, they do a reversal of ""Psycho"" by having the mother emulate the dead son! It's hilarious (""kill her, mommy!"", she says repeatedly in a high voice). And what was that last girl thinking as she piled up all that junk against the door? It obviously didn't matter because there were two big windows right next to it! How awful.
I'm shocked by reviews here from people that were actually scared by this! Now THAT is scary!
What an awful film. I can't believe people got rich off of this one. It's not even worth the celluloid it was filmed on.",1036195200,3,1444,4.391791044776119

238102,1,6300214087,"""Friday the 13th"", it's John Carpenter's classic ""Halloween"" in the country, or more precisely in a vacation camp for teenagers. It's easier to shoot a little horror film in a desert place than in Los Angeles (yes, actually, ""Halloween"" was shot in Los Angeles). You take a group of young, horny characters searching for some chilling and strong emotions, coming (on purpose?) in a desert, isolated, frightening, cursed place with a past and reputation, closed by the authorities because of some tragic events which occured in this very place, many years before. This is stupid and very, too predictible. You're at once able to guess that in the end all the characters will die... except one woman, like in some classic American horror movies released a little time before (""Halloween"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Alien""...).
Take the whole plot of ""Halloween"" (a group of young people, a lonesome, hiding serial killer with a mask - here the one of an ice-hockey player, which isn't difficult to find -, a forest to set a so-called 'atmosphere' - in ""Halloween"", Michael Myers uses the trees and other thick plants in order to stay out of sight -, and a stupid opened ending - 'So he's still over there!'), put much more blood and violence in it ('gore' scenes like decapitations, cut throats...) and you got a picture (a copy, but still a picture), not good at all but able to get the same financial success as ""Halloween""'s. This is really the essential, the main thing, no matter the quality, the actors and the makers (if we know everything about Carpenter, we don't know nothing about Sean S. Cunningham and we don't care about the screenwriter); when you leave the theater or stop the tape recorder, you don't have the feeling that you just watched an unforgettable film. Because ""Friday the 13th"" is no good, it's ridiculous. I won't tell about the too many sequels (nine so far), the ones as silly as the others, made only for a commercial purpose.
In 1996, Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson made exactly the same thing with ""Scream"" (& sequels), taking the plot and putting it on a campus, with a cast of young actors looking like top-models and a result as bad as in this one.",1034726400,,2192,4.7408376963350785

There are some good gory offings for the splatter fans out there and the infamous twist ending is still cool even by today's standards.  The DVD picture quality is alright, however the sound would have benefited greatly from a 5.1 surround remixing.  There are also no special features to speak of except a really bad trailer.  Interviews with the now unknown cast (except Kevin Bacon, of course) would have been interesting at least, if not deleted scenes or something.

 When two romancing camp counsellors are savagely slain by the hands of an unseen killer one late night, Camp Crystal Lake is immediately shuttered for the safety of others. But now, twenty years later, when an ambitious man by the name of Steve Christy prepares to reopen the campgrounds with the help of several young counsellors despite grave warnings of a ""death curse"" by local residents (and a previous fire which burnt down the camp, as well as a deadly contamination with the water), the killings start again. On the dreaded day and date that is Friday June the 13th, the curse proves true, as one-by-one each of the counsellors is attacked and savagely slain by the very hands responsible for the death of the first two back in the year of nineteen fifty-eight...just a year after the death of a young disadvantaged boy who drowned in the murky waters of Camp Crystal Lake due to the negligence of...romancing camp counsellors. Friday the 13th will never be the same...not after watching this movie-not after watching Friday the 13th.
The lowdown:
I am like the biggest Friday the 13th fan ever-this I am sure of. I mean, I'm the sort of fan who'd, on eBay, bid on every single solitary thing that has to do with the series if I wouldn't get robbed of my money so much (damn, I want those uncut versions!). I'm the sort of fan whose immediate thoughts when heading up to camp for a weeks vacation with family and friends would be of the series before even arriving, for that matter. I'm the sort of fan who, when at camp, would get so carried away with my video camera recording all those wonderful sceneries nature has to offer, that I would take it as though I was making a movie than a home video. Hell, I'm even the sort of fan who once used to stalk and ""slay"" campers in a game-appropriately played at night and in the woods, mind you-called...yeah, ya guessed it...""Jason."" Now every time I go camping with my brother and his friends, I am faced with secretly disappointed kids whose favourite man for the job just rejected playing their favourite game created by him, all the more. I don't enjoy refusing to play with them, but everyone's gotta grow up sometime-and I've reached my time...I think.
Although none had achieved the raving success of the original Friday the 13th, the majority of the sequels, although quite moronic at times and increasingly senseless-relying on merely how shockingly repellent each death sequence should be than rationality and an actual storyline-they're still very much entertaining and fun-to-watch. I say fun in the sense of watching a film regarding complete idiots (who were cared for early in the series) who, summer-after-summer, embark upon the remotest forest locations at or nearby sites that are known for their death toll, while fully conscious of the fact that, somewhere, somewhere within those seemingly endless rows of trees that encircle them, is an avenged killer watching their every move, who'll ultimately render them helpless and, one-by-one, slay them in the most grisly of ways until he has met his match in a final showdown between good and evil that'll leave you breathless. Besides, since when has an actual storyline been the driving force as to why we find ourselves watching silly popcorn slashers like these, anyway? We do so-or so I believe-not necessarily for any real plot (or Oscar-worthy performances), but for a good time, a good time with friends while stuffing ourselves with junk food until we are unable to move. I'm I right? Is anyone relating to what I'm saying here? Does that whole scene sound familiar? I mean, if you dig these kinds of films, you should know what I'm talking about here. They aren't high art, they're slashers. And now that I've got all that outta the way, let's begin with the one that started it all, shall we...
 Released the same year as immediate blockbusters such as the legendary Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, Irvin Kershner's Star Wars-Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, and Harold Ramis' Caddyshack, which are all still praised by moviegoers as of today, one wouldn't anticipate that a low-budget slasher like Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th(also known as I have learned from the Internet Movie Database, Long Night at Camp Blood) receiving the same success. Hell, even Cunningham himself was surprised when his film was that of one to be catapulted as one of the best twenty-five of the year. It was not only as successful, despite a lot of flack by critics, but was so influential that it spawned not only nine sequels-and now apparently soon to be ten, which makes it the longest running series in the horror genre-but also a television series of its own! I personally like it as much as I do because it has a lot of ambience (we see the placid, murky lake; the trees dancing in the wind; the clouded full moon), a lot of ambience as well as a lot of mystery, that's partly the result of those very shots, because, if they're not to show us the menacing nature of the campground's surroundings as day grows weary and night takes over, they're to hint that things may not be the way they seem to be... that the quietness can fool you.
 Aside from the remote forest locations, there were a few other factors that elevated it from its peers in the successful and viable subgenre: An Oscar-worthy music score by Harry Manfredini (magnificent was its theme song in particular, which sounds both assuasive and mysterious, and therefore it, with the help of the film's low-budget, actually enhances the spooky feeling); inventive and horrific death sequences that, although it and its sequels were heavily cut by the dreaded MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), are still most definitely not suitable for the squeamish; and an energetic Tom Savini, whose gruesome makeup effects were beyond exceptional.
 Friday the 13th also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, who radically altered the misogynistic ""man stalks woman"" formula, and quickly became one of the largest horror-movie-killers in the modern era, next to the darkly comical and horridly scarred Freddy Krueger from Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street, and the ghostly Michael Myers from John Carpenter's Halloween. And to think, I once thought that Friday the 13th was like onna the cheesiest, most ludicrous films ever to be made. (I say once.)",1027123200,5,6350,4.83900643974241

 Released the same year as immediate blockbusters such as the legendary Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, Irvin Kershner's Star Wars-Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, and Harold Ramis' Caddyshack, which are still praised by moviegoers as of today, one wouldn't anticipate that a low-budget slasher like Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th (also known as Long Night at Camp Blood), receiving the same success. Hell, even Cunningham himself was surprised when his film was that of one to be catapulted as one of the best twenty-five of the year! It was not only as successful, despite a lot of flack by critics, but was so influential that it spawned not only nine-and now apparently soon to be ten-sequels, which makes it the longest running series in the horror genre, but also a television series! I personally like it as much as I do because it has a lot of ambience (we see the placid, murky lake; the trees dancing in the wind; the clouded full moon- things that leave room for plenty of mystery. They do so because all these things shown have some meaning of significance one way or another; if it's not to hint that things may not be the way they seem to be, it's to show us the menacing nature of the camp's surroundings as day grows weary and night falls).
 Aside from the remote forest locations, there were a few other factors that elevated it from its peers in the successful and viable genre: An Oscar-worthy music score by Harry Manfredini (magnificent was its theme song in particular, which sounds both assuasive and mysterious, and therefore it, with the help of the film's low-budget, actually enhances the spooky feeling); inventive and horrific death sequences that, although it and its sequels were heavily cut by the dreaded MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), are still most definitely not suitable for the squeamish; and an energetic Tom Savini, whose gruesome makeup effects were beyond exceptional.
 Friday the 13th also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, who radically altered the misogynistic ""man stalks woman"" formula, and quickly became one of the largest psycho-horror-killers in the modern era, next to the darkly comical and horridly scarred Freddy Krueger from Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street, and the ghostly Michael Myers from John Carpenter's Halloween, which also opened new doors in the genre and popularized numerous themes and techniques.
 And to think, I once thought of Friday the 13th as being one of the absurdest, most ludicrous horror films ever to be made (""Kill her, mommy... Kill her! Don't let her get away mommy... Don't let her live. I won't, Jason..."" yeah, that part really got to me), regretting that I ever watched it and wasted both one of my friend's and my own time. But, that was me then and this is me now. Isn't it? I mean...hell...obviously. Friday the 13ths were never the same since, baby, not for this horror buff.",1024963200,,4121,4.9479768786127165

The deaths, the plot, Mrs. Voorhees, the acting(?), well the acting isn't that great but Mrs. voorhees is extremely convincing when it comes to playing a complete psychopath.  I really think this and part 2 are the best of the series, it's as if like after part 1 and 2 the series started to lose its edge, much like Jaws and Halloween where the plot got too old and the movies weren't as frightening to watch.  This movie is very dated, but it reigns as the classic slasher...  The DVD quality is alright.. the sound isn't bad but I really think it's nice to have a version of the film on DVD because having the movie digital cleans up a lot of the problems with the vhs version of the movie, I just wish their were more extras, but overall the movie is amazing, completely suspensful, ""we didn't find any boy..""",1024531200,,1091,4.180952380952381

Some parts in this movie are very scary, escpecially the end. Too bad no one makes this type of movie anymore. This movie, however, does contain some bad acting as do many other 80's horror movies, which pushes it back to B-Movie Cinema.

238146,5,6300214087,"In the year 1957 at a Campsite buried in the woods a young boy drowns in the camp lake. The two councillors who were supposed to be watching him were making love at the time. One year later these two councillors are followed into the camp barn by an unseen assasin. They are both murdered.
It is now twelve years later and the camp is being reopened by Steve Christie who has hired seven new councillors. The date is Friday 13th June. The locals are shocked that 'Camp Blood' is being reopened and warn the councillors to quit.
None of the luckless teenagers listen to the warnings about Camp Crystal Lake and roam the campsite carefree. Unknown to them there is an unwelcome presence in the camp. A presence that is watching the councillors at every turn. One by one they fall prey to an unseen killer and when the killer is finally revealed it comes as a bit of a shock. The film is absolutely fantastic and it is the one that started it all. If you're going to watch this film don't decide that there's no plot and switch it off. Watch the whole thing, the plot is explained very clearly when the killer is revealed. There are some great makeup effects when the councillors are killed eg the axe through the head. In this film watch out for a seventeen year old Kevin Bacon! This was probably one of his first big parts.

238148,4,6300214087,"On a lazy sunlit day in 1957, a little boy drowns in woodsy Camp Crystal Lake because the two counselors on duty are making love instead of doing their job.  A year later, these two counselors are savagely murdered.  The camp is closed down and that of course is that....
Fast forward to 1980.  Steve Christy is doing his best to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, having hired six nubile counselors who are all on their way to help with the preparations on Friday the 13th, which just happens to be the birthday of the little boy who drowned.
One by one these counselors are systematically slaughtered by someone who doesn't want the camp reopened.
Annie is a perky young lass hitchhiking up to camp; unfortunately she accepts a ride from a stranger and realizes her mistake too late.  ""Hey, wasn't that the road to Camp Crystal Lake back there?""  The jeep merely accelerates.  ""Please stop! Please stop!""  Annie finally catapults herself out of the speeding vehicle into a ditch.  Her leg sprained, she manages to get to her feet just as the jeep backs up toward her and stops.  She flees into the woods, while the black-trousered killer follows swiftly.  Annie limps through the forest to a tree and leans back...only to see, to her horror, that her fate is sealed: a dagger is ripped across her throat, slicing it open.
Night falls and Marcie, a panty-clad lithe counselor, is alone in the restroom washing her hands when she hears a noise.  ""Ollie-ollie-in-free!"" she giggles, yanking back the shower curtains.  Then a shadow appears.  Marcie cowers in the shower stall as an axe guillotines downward in a scintillating arc, splitting her head open like a ripe melon.
The remaining counselors are dispatched methodically by spear and by bow -and-arrow, leaving only Goody Two Shoes Alice (Adrienne King), a Doris Day clone who looks like she couldn't swat a fly.  She's panicked that all the other counselors have vanished; when she discovers a bloodied corpse fastened to the door, her panic turns quickly to full-blown terror.
Alice locks herself inside one of the other cabins, then is relieved to see headlights flashing through a window as a vehicle pulls in.  She runs out gratefully and is relieved to see that it's alright, it's only kindly Mrs. Voorhees, who used to work at Camp Crystal Lake when she was young.
But why is Mrs. Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) so unafraid when Alice cries out that all her friends are dead?  The fiftyish, puffy-cheeked, bug-eyed, grey-sweatered, black-trousered woman with the curly blonde hairdo seems utterly unaffected and perpetually smiling.
What in the world is going on here?
Watch FRIDAY THE 13th and find out.  Betsy Palmer gives a decidedly bravura performance at the end, and what the movie lacks in suspense it makes up for in gore.
One thing you might be wondering:  where is the famous Jason?  Why, he's the little boy who drowned in the lake back in 1957.  Don't ask, just watch.  You'll love it.",1020643200,,2943,4.799603174603175

238179,3,6300214087,"In the wake of the extraordinary success of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) it
was inevitable that imitations and rip-offs would follow. Of these perhaps the most
successful was Friday the 13th (1980). This is possibly the ultimate stalk and slash
movie. It may be a rip-off of Halloween, but it fairly good. Friday the 13 was
critically loathed, unlike Halloween (1978), but it made loads of money.
 It starts in 1958 with a group of councillors singing around a fire. A couple sneak off
to make love, but before they can get very far they get attacked and killed. There
attacker was never found.
 The film then flashes forward to the Friday the 13th in the present (1980) and shows
us the councillors who are attempting to re-open the camp. The action takes place
over one day and night. We see the councillors preparing the camp for the onslaught
of kiddies, but when night falls and with it a thunder storm the killer moves in to
overdrive. The killer dispatches his victims rapidly, but none of the them match the
murders in Halloween. They do however out do the murders in the gore stakes. The
ending is fairly surprising if you don't know who the killer is and the film generates a
relentless atmosphere. This would be lost in the following films. The ending is possibly the only time which the audience jumps out of it seats with it being a rip-off
of Carrie (1976). Saying that thought it does work at least for the first time. It was extremely successful making millions. Followed by sequel: Friday the 13th Part Two

So there.
Mention the name Friday the 13th in the context of movies and invariably you'll get one person to roll their eyes and say ""Are they making another one of those?"".  The answer, by the way, is always yes.  Friday the 13th has become synonymous with all that is wrong with horror movies -- multiple sequels that ignore or rewrite everything that has been told so for, stupid kids that keep going back to the camp even though they know what happened.  But, in the beginning, we had this movie.  Before hockey masks and psychics and Corey Feldman came plain, simple Friday the 13th; a non-flashy, violent retelling of the Ten Little Indians formula.  It works for about 45m. then bogs down when we have to get rid of the counselors, then it picks up again for the last 20m.
The first thing to note about the DVD is that it is still the cut-down version except (allegedly) the death of the female hiker near the opening.  I don't normally care about gore because it doesn't add anything to the story (there are exceptions), but they also didn't include the alternate ending where Bill survives and is reunited with Alice.  If you're going to do a DVD, do it right.  Oh well, it's widescreen.  And we have the trailer and the narrator with the cool voice -- ""You may only see it once, but that will be enough.""  Cool.
If you've never seen it before, give it a try.  If you're a collector, try the Japanese version (it has everything this one doesn't) or wait and see if Paramount does a 25th Anniversary Edition.

The film lacks hardly any action until about halfway through when the stormy night begins. From then on the movie picks up steam (and gore) until the chilling end of the movie.

Alice - an innocent looking teen who has all the hallmarks of a poor victim. Adrienne King gives Alice a real girl next door exterior, which is perfect for horror. Will her innocence save her?
Jack - the stud with the girlfriend. Jack is a great guy that everyone will love, he's also very strong and manly. Kevin Bacon is perfect for this role. Will his strength and manliness keep him from the knife?
Marcie - Jacks girlfriend. She's very girly and deep down hopes the summer will be non stop passion with Jack. She is played by Jeannine Taylor. Will she ignore the evil out in the woods?
Ned - the joker. He see's this summer as a chance to look at the ladies and to basically crack jokes. Played by Mark Nelson. Will he be laughing all the way to the bottom of Crystal lake?
Brenda - she arrives at camp by herself and she's ready for a summer of fun, although she has a mom like side to her. Played by Laurie Bartram. Does her normal but chirpy character bore the killer to death? or does it become more of a reason to kill?
Bill - Bill is the guy everyone will love because he's so down to earth and an all round good apple. Will his good guy exterior save him in the 24 hours that lay ahead?
Mrs Vorhee's - poor woman lost her son at Camp Crystal and all she wants is for the Camp to be shut down. Will she get what she wants? or will Camp Crystal remain drenched in blood?
Crazy Raplh - the guy knows that Camp Crystal Lake is cursed. will he convince them that if they go they will never come back? or will he fall victim himself?
The thought of 24 hours in a wooded area is enough to scare anyone. The movie has its tacky special effects and the acting isn't exactly oscar material but hey its great 80's horror..what do you expect?

Steve recruits a group of teenagers (or young adults, aging actors, whatever you wanna call it) to help him repair the campsite and open it for business. Well, faster than you can say Madman Marz, killings start happening everywhere and no one has the slightest clue who is doing it all.

238253,5,6300214087,"Although this first installment in the highly successful slasher series lacks what it is most famous for - serial killer Jason Vorhees - it is the best in the series. The infamous score by Harry Manfredini is excellent and scary and carries the film very well. The cast of basic unknowns adds to the sense of isolation that the makers of this film knew was a key element to making it as frightening as it is.
Critics love to trash this movie but it must have done something right to spawn more sequels than any other.
The plot probably needs no explanation but goes simply like this: Counselors setting up a camp in the middle of the woods are killed one by one in, each in a different grisly manner, but who is doing the killing?
Many people take so many aspects of this film for granted because it has been ripped-off so many times (although, to be fair, it is somewhat a rip-off in itself of Halloween - using a holiday and a slasher killing teens). But this film introduced many elements into a genre it would actually almost invent by itself - the slasher film.
First off all, we have the wooded setting, next we have a series of gruesome and creative killings (tamed by today's standards), using the camera to make you, the viewer, see the slaying of the victims through the eyes of the killer.
The shock-ending of this film was probably the most effective of its kind in movie history and during its run at the theaters, you would inevitably hear a tremendous letout of screams right before the movie ended (I won't mention what this is just on the slight notion that someone doesn't know what I'm talking about). But the reason this scene succeeded so well was simple...because the film effectively created a genuiune feeling of terror and suspense for the first 85 minutes and took viewers by surprise.
FRIDAY THE 13TH looks great in this digitally remastered widescreen DVD and helps to eliminate the dated look it was taking on due to increasingly poorer VHS releases. The only special features that this film does have are the trailer (which is not remastered but shows the great contrast between the remastered and unremastered prints) and chapter selection. Unfortunately this is not the un-cut version but for some reason does contain a few extra seconds of blood in one scene (the third killing in the film of Annie) and a few deleted scenes in another (the decapitation near the end of the movie) and also contains a few extra seconds of the sex scene. An uncut version or collector's edition has been cried out for amongst the many fans of FRIDAY THE 13TH but has been inexplicably ignored by its distributor, Paramount Pictures, who basically view this cash cow as a blemish on the face of their film catalog.",1008201600,12,2728,4.626804123711341

Terror and suspense abound in this twenty-four-hour nightmare of blood. Camp Crystal Lake has been shuttered for over twenty-years due to several vicious and unsolved murders. The camp's new owner and several young counselors are readying the property for re-opening despite warnings of a ""death curse"" by local residents. The curse proves true on Friday the 13th, as one-by-one each of the counselors is stalked by a violent killer.
My remarks toward this picture
There has always been something about every Friday the 13th movie (alright, almost every one) that not only gives me the quivers but mesmerizes me as well, stimulates my imagination and has me longing for my own camera and production crew in order to be able to make a slasher of my own. It's primarily that aflutter sense of isolation that develops within me every time I make my usual trip up to the mountains each summer, you see, which, as the great myth of the Sasquatch does to those who have spent their entire lives searching for and running across no luck whatsoever since the famous Patterson Film back in the year of nineteen-sixty-seven which indicated of its existence, spurs curiosity in my mind as to whether or not somewhere, somewhere within such wilderness, such remote grounds, truly lies a savage beast beyond our world, who'll devour any who unwittingly happen to step foot in its inhabitance...or maybe it won't; hell, maybe it'd be scared of us for all I know. The point that I'm trying to make is that the mere premise of beings beyond our world lurking within grounds in which I visit every couple of months to get away from it all and take some time off from the pressures of the world injects great ebullience. It's a fascinating subject we should all believe in: immediate exercise of divine power; the supernatural. Like in the movie Predator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, just because you don't see something doesn't precisely mean that it's not there.
I often recall back in the days as a junior in grade school, when I used to fervently step inside video stores for the sheer pleasure of making my way to the horror section and scrutinizing through the various ghastly images covers from such series' as the Friday the 13th have to offer (although it wasn't like I would ever be allowed to walk out on my own with any of them, anyway), despite of the fact that they all scared me and occasionally gave me nightmares, even. Sometimes, they were so harrowing, so very dreadful that I would wind up staying up half the night in fear of having to go through them once more. However, what once haunted me now lies within my room: a vast collection of films-the majority being horror-awaiting to once again be viewed through my eyes, that are likely, or rather hopefully, to someday, some glorious day, view work that has been done by me, and all because of the influence such a series would've had.
""The truth is,"" co-writer/producer/director Sean Cunningham, told Fangoria magazine in 1980, ""I needed a hit film."" Little had he known during production that Gulf + Western's savvy marketing machine would catapult his seminal Voorhees opus into its reported ""June the 13th, 1980"" release date, became a surprise hit during the precise summer such others as The Empire Strikes back, Caddyshack, and The Shining were also released. To those who are clueless as to why, perhaps it's because Cunningham's modest slasher offered the habitual ""isolated"" environment, but with a little more essence on the side which elevated it from its peers in the genre: a narrative which radically altered the misogynistic ""man stalks woman"" formula; make-up effects by an up-and-coming Tom Savini; creative and horrific death sequences you would expect from a film that makes certain the term ""several counselors"" was written on both the VHS and DVD package, for those outside of the genre would instantaneously become cognizant of the real appeal their cast of characters carry, aside from of course arousing us when ""going all the way"" with their partners, a physical affection that's apparently a moral which makes clear that if choosing to act out upon, the consequences are severe, very severe; and because of an atonally-based music score by Harry Manfredini. (The theme song, that mysterious-sounding tune is both comely and yet eerie and ever so hypnotic. Every horror series has to have one, and its is sure my favorite. Hell, I'd even buy the soundtrack. The music's wonderful.)
When combining all of these spices together, you have an ideal horror film that has every single ingredient authentic horror fanatics such as myself could possibly ever ask for! It also being one to give birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three largest mass murderers of the modern era; the other two of course being the darkly comical Freddy Krueger from A Nightmare on Elm Street and ghostly Michael Myers from Halloween, which also helped spawn the genre's progression of the `80s.
Forever duplicated, the original Friday the 13th popularized numerous themes and techniques in which I've previously mentioned when giving reason as to its popularity, that are now merely clich&eacute;s.
Despite their failure for greater fame, the majority of the sequels, although they are quite moronic at times and increasingly senseless, they're still very much entertaining and fun-to-watch; fun in the sense of viewing a film regarding complete idiots being hacked apart by a rather inept murderer with ever so many places to conceal of himself in in consideration of the great touch of atmosphere each one is given. (Besides, since when has motive been a major factor in silly slashers such as these? We watch them, not necessarily for any plot, but for a good scare; a good time with our friends while filling our abdomens with junk food at a time when the elderly would have fallen asleep long ago. As long as the sequels are true to the series and follow in the same footsteps, it's all-good.)",1005609600,6,5991,4.909270216962525

238286,5,6300214087,"Friday The 13th was made after the success of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"", which was made in 1978.  ""Friday The 13th"" was written by Victor Miller and directed by Sean S. Cunningham.  I agree with a few other reviewers, I don't find the movie nearly as suspensful or scary as ""Halloween"", but it's still a very fun movie.
It starts up at Camp Crystal Lake, in 1958, where two teens, Barry (Willie Adams) and Claudette (Debra S. Hayes) are slashed up by an unknown assasin.  Due to this incident, the camp is closed down for four years, before it's reopened in 1962.  But, that opening is unsuccesful, because the lake's water is poisoned!  Then, in 1964, they try, yet again, to reopen the camp, only to be faced with a mysterious fire!  So, they give up and shut down the camp for almost twenty years.  But then, in 1979, Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer) decides to reopen despite the objection of the townsfolk.  He spents 25,000 dollars trying to get the place in shape, and spends one whole year cleaning it up, and building the cabins.  Then, in 1980, a group of seven counselors are heading up to Crystal Lake to help Christy out.  This group includes, Alice (Adrienne King), Marci (Jeanine Taylor), Ned (Mark Nelson), Brenda (Laurie Bartham), Annie (Robbi Morgan), Bill (Harry Crosby), and Jack (future star Kevin Bacon, in his third movie role).  They're all pretty excited to be going up to the camp, but pretty soon they're not gonna be.  You see, this unknown killer is very angry for some reason that this camp is being opened again.  Who will survive the night?  Watch and see!
Friday The 13th, despite lack of good reviews and lack of a plot, is a fun watch.  The actors all seem to know that they're in a bad movie, and end up having more fun with they're parts.  The charecters are purely cardboard, but I don't mind.  I really love Harry Manfredini's score, which sounds a lot like the score for Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"".  Manfredini would go on to do every sequal (except for Part VIII, Jason Takes Manhattan). The murders aren't nearly as gory as most people say (if you want gory murders, see the director's cut of Jason Goes To Hell The Final Friday), but the makeup effects are still fine, by horror makeup master Tom Savini (Day Of The Dead, Friday The 13th The Final Chapter, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2). The most popular murder is undoutebly Mr. Bacons.  He gets an arrow through the throat (if you play it in slow motion, you'll notice a big glob of blood shoots into his mouth).
This DVD is actually much better than most fans credit it for being.  If you're a true fan, you'll appreciate the theatrical trailer, the scene selection, and the terrific picture quality of the movie itself.  It's also really hilarious to watch the film in french.  An also, you may notice tw things about the movie itself.  Annie's death (slit throat) is about five seconds longer, and shows her falling to the ground before the typical flash of light.  And The Killer's death (I won't say who the killer is, but rest assured, it's NOT Jason) is a small tad longer.  These extended murders are uncredited, but they're there!!  My compliments also go to Paramount for the terrific picture they've offered to us.  Throw out your VHS, this picture is REALLY good (the DVDs for Part 2 and 3 are good too, but 4 isn't that good).  Some people complain that the sound's mono, but I barely even notice.
I really recommend that you by this movie, even if you have the video.  The picture makes it worth the price alone.  If you enjoyed this film, I'd reccomend Parts 2, 3 ,4, 6, and 9.  The rest are fun, but not nearly as good.

238288,3,6300214087,"Schlock movie maker Sean S. Cunningham had every intention of making a buck with this gory little movie that truly launched the slasher craze of the early 80s.  That he made a cinematic legend was strictly an accident.
John Carpenter's Halloween had proved to be a huge hit just a year or two previous to this film and making a similar slaughter date movie to cash in on the trend seemed a good idea.  So Friday the 13th (another 'bad date' title) was born.
Like Halloween the movie starts with the post coital murder of two sneak away lovers, roll credits and jump forward to 'The Present'.  A well meaning camp counselor is trying to reopen Camp Crystal Lake much to the distaste of the locals, for it is there that the pre-credit murders happened.  It seems that so much bad luck has befallen camps in the area that just about everyone agrees that it must have a death curse.  Boy have they got that right.  For someone is lurking in the woods, watching and stalking the gathering counselors, and when night falls and a storm rolls in, the killer pounces.  Again and again the blood flows freely at Camp Crystal Lake.
Nothing more than a simplistic low budget exploitation shocker, Friday the 13th's biggest controversy wasn't its sex and graphic bloodletting, but that a major Hollywood studio (Paramount) would even buy the distribution rights and release such a sleazy item, not to mention making a mint doing so.  This might be worth viewing for those interested in seeing the birth of a cinematic trend that would take years to burn out - only to come back again and again just like the unstoppable killers that populated it.  Just remember that Friday the 13th is really nothing special, just a little exploitation flick that got very lucky.  Recommended to the curious.",1003449600,,1779,4.691318327974277

The death scenes are raw and graphic, especially the one involving a young Kevin Bacon. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it is a decent film.

FRIDAY THE 13TH was also the first film I bought on VHS when I bought my VCR in 1989, then I bought the DVD edition of the film when released in October 1999.
FRIDAY THE 13TH was the original slasher film that started it all.  Back in the day, it was unusual to have a female killer lurking around only to be decapitated by another female.  Although FRIDAY THE 13TH has a cardboard plot, it offers its trademark music by Harry Manfredini (who helmed music for all the films with the exception of Jason Takes Manhattan) , its fine special effects by Tom Savini (who returned for The Final Chapter) and of course, an appearance by Kevin Bacon and former Miss America Betsy Palmer.
FRIDAY THE 13TH on DVD is pretty good, despite its lack of extra feautures.  FRIDAY THE 13TH is shown on standard widescreen (1.85:1) for the very first time.  The picture quality is quite amazing and the sound is pretty good despite its Mono sound.  I was surprised but thrown off by two things - the extended murder of Annie - the hitchhiker and the slight trimming of the decapitation of Mrs. Voorhees.  Although I found the film to be overall good on DVD, this film should have feautured all extended murders (as all murders were cut, but available thru Warner in Japan in its uncut format), and more extras.

Theatrically released in 1980 by Paramount Studios in an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the enormously successful 1978 independent motion picture ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"" became an instant hit among teen audiences and has, to date, led to an astounding 8 sequels (the best of which are ""2"", ""3"" and ""5""), with a 9th (""Jason X"") to be released sometime in 2002.

238347,3,6300214087,"As a huge fan of the series, all nine films are decent, in their own respects.  My opinion of what a horror movie should be greatly differs from what most people would.  I think you should be scared, but at the same time entertained.  Hence, why I favor the ""Scream"" trilogy over ""Halloween"" any day.  ""Friday the 13th"" used to scare the hell out of me when I saw it (over and over again) as a nine-year-old kid.  And still, I liked routing for the killer to do off with its next victim in whatever gruesome sequence the filmmakers had in mind.  It's flat out entertaining to scream with a bunch of your ill-experienced, sex-deprived friends whenever the big-breasted girl gets stabbed in the shower or speared through the neck.
And yet, the film shows its age.  After seeing it a billion times, it no longer has the effect I desired so long ago.  I favor the later films, as the make-up got better, and Jason Voorhees became an unstoppable force of nature.  Sure, the series by definition is hokey, and every major film critic and aficionado point out the garbage presented by the terrible sequels, but that's what makes a franchise like this such a fun watch.
With the original ""Friday the 13th"", camp councelors re-open Crsytal Lake, unaware of the dangers that plagued it in the past.  One by one, they're offed by a mysterious murderer, and in typical 80s horror fashion, the bodies are all revealed to the survivor by the end.  Other than the bloody make-up and crude cinematography, there's no real magic going on, but who said there ever was?  It's a subject of a once-great genre, that reflects the more-recent stock of teen-horror that graces our culture today.  And as it is the original ""Friday"", it's safe to make the claim that it did inspire many of the cliche films that copied it, much as ""Halloween"" did two years before.  It's a benchmark in the genre, and love it or hate it, it pretty much started it all.

""Camp Blood"", where 22 years ago two counselors were butchered a year after a young boy named Jason Voorhees drowned in the lake.  Now, it's Friday the 13th, and the unknown, violent killer is stalking Camp Crystal Lake again.

The original Friday the 13th capitalized on the market opened up by the original Halloween.  F13 took a different approach however.  Here we start with a flashback to many years ago when a young boy drowns and someone kills 2 camp counselors.  The camp is closed down soon afterwards (what a shame...can you imagine the ghost stories they would have to tell around the camp fire next year?)
Fastforward to 1980.  Someone decides to reopen Camp Crystal Lake.  Now, I have been to summer camp and it can get pretty creepy at night.  The film accents the darkness and feeling of isolation.  When people start disappearing, you have to think ""should we go look for them?"" or ""should we get the heck outta here?""  WE know the missing people are getting whacked, but THEY don't.  That's the building block of tension.
Although the franchise it painted with a broad stroke as ""teens go to spooky camp and get knifed to death"", the original F13 is the only movie in the franchise that puts the characters in a nearly deserted camp (the kids haven't arrived yet), in the dark, cut off from civilization, and without 80 different useless plots going on at once.

Of course, we know Jason's mother did the evil duties in this original with a dream-cameo by young Jason at the end, in one of horror's great jack-in-the-box scares.
Of course, the story starts at a summer camp, Camp Crystal Lake, where its been closed down for a long time, waiting for human lives to invade it and find themselves invaded by a mysterious murderer! Following in the tradition of Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and countless other horror fiction gems, the film's death scenes come one-by-one. Untill the last surviving victim, Annie, beheads Jason's poor mommy who was seeking revenge for her poor son. Amazingly, this film has seen very little relation to Psycho. When this movie is very much a reversal of the Norman Bates scenario. In Psycho, Norman Bates was using his mother as a dual-idenity, in Friday The 13th, Pamela Voorhees uses her son as a dual-idenity. Very clever and movie trivial situation.
Adrienne King plays the heroine here and and is as dangerous to infamous screen villains as Jamie Lee Curtis and Sigourney Weaver. Why Adrienne King did not become a movie star is beyond me. Of course, Kevin Bacon did become a star. And as a matter of fact this may be my favorite of his screen appearances. Of course other stars like Tom Hanks (He Knows Your Alone) and  Jim Carrey (Love At First Bite) started there careers off early with something to do with the horror genre.

238475,3,6300214087,"In desperate need of a hit, Sean S. Cunningham had a stroke of genius: Why not combine the elements of suspense of ""Halloween"" with all the graphic violence of ""Dawn of the Dead""? Indeed, why not? A runaway smash during the summer of 1980 (beaten out only by ""The Empire Strikes Back"") this was followed by nine sequels and an in-name only TV series.
The cursory plot involves several camp counselors setting out to re-open Camp Crystal Lake after some twenty years, following some unexplained murders and accidents. The new counselors laugh off warnings of a ""death curse"" by the locals and the town drunk and start to ready the property, with time out of course for pot, beer, sex, and a round of strip Monopoly. Unaware an unseen killer is prowling the camp, one by one they fall victim in a variety of gruesome ways, with a little help from makeup artist Tom Savini, whom Cunningham tapped from ""Dawn of the Dead"".
A definite fan favorite with the special effects, suspense, body count, and a heart-stopping finale. Nonetheless, the film is not perfect. The dialogue is at best laughable, and there are some killer POV shots that are totally impossible (the victims would able to see the assailant). Controversy surrounding the film no doubt helped at the box office; Gene Siskel sent a letter to Paramount asking how they could distribute such a film, the MPAA took criticism for the violence that slipped the censors, and Leonard Maltin suggested that this is the reason why SAT scores are on the decline. Ironically, two years earlier no major studio would distribute ""Halloween"" (too exploitative, they said) and now Warner Bros., Universal, and Paramount all made bids on this one. Looks like John Carpenter had the last laugh there.
The only DVD extra is the theatrical trailer and newcomers shouldn't watch that first as it blows a lot of the scares. Most of the death scenes were snipped of a few seconds by the MPAA (these are intact on the Japanese laserdisc version) and only one (the death of Annie) is restored here, though that's thought to be a mistake on Paramount's part. Despite massive fan protest, Paramount (as of this writing) has no plans to release any of the ""Friday"" films uncut.

I was a big fan of this movie since I had seen it for the first time on TV back in either '81 or '82. It has since become one of my top 3 favorite movies (including Apocalypse Now and the Shining). Everything about the movie appeals to me, the camp itself (Camp NoBeBoSco near Blairstown New jersey), the beautiful Pine barrens of Western New Jersey, stylized photography and lighting by Barry Abrams,good acting which is rare in horror fims!!, unbelievable makeup effects (by make-up guru Tom Savini), and what maybe the greatest Horror soundtrack ever!

Off with the lights, on with the movie. Mesmerizing stuff! By the end, my friend, who was no big fan of horror movies was scared stupid. He actually jumped of the couch at the canoe in the water sequence. He said he actually liked it, alot.  I was blown away by the superiority of the DVD movie over the VHS version. Great color and sharpness, improved sound and virtually no video artifacts. The difference between the two is amazing! Definetely the best I have ever seen between a VHS version and the DVD version.

Ever since, Camp Crystal Lake has a ""death curse"", and few have made it unscathed. In the ""scare-factor"" department, this movie somewhat does its job. It's more gruesome than scary, with make-up by the legendary Tom Savini. The music score, with the ever-famous ""chi chi chi ha ha ha"" sound is very creepy and sticks in your head. The flaw comes in the scripting and acting; sometimes very pretentious. The people who starred in this movie were either up-and-coming, unknown, or an older celebrity. The most memorable role is played by Betsy Palmer-Mrs. Voorhees, who turns out to be Jason's mother. A young Kevin Bacon also plays the role of Jack, 4 years before 1984's ""Footloose"". Virtually all the other actors in this movie were pretty much unknown at time of release, and still are not very known 20 years later. However, the toon loony Crazy Ralph, played by Walter Gorney, is a memorable and even comical role, although it is quite short. Whereas i definitely recommend getting this one, i advise viewers to just see it as sort of a ""fun"" horror film; in other words, don't be looking for depth here.

(USA - 1980)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

In the wake of revisionist splatter movies like SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, it may be difficult for today's audiences to imagine how much the modern horror genre owes to Sean S. Cunningham's seminal splatter movie. Borne from the success of HALLOWEEN (1978), Cunningham's film reworked the template set down by John Carpenter, placing a group of vulnerable teens in an isolated location (in this instance, a run-down summer camp plagued by a series of unexplained 'accidents') before unleasing a deadly, unstoppable force against them. Cunningham underlined the element of mystery and suspense by hiring makeup wiz Tom Savini - fresh from his groundbreaking work on DAWN OF THE DEAD - to stage a series of elaborately gruesome set-pieces. This potent combination knocked mainstream audiences sideways, and the film was a huge success, spearheading a wave of independent horror films which dominated movie screens in the early 1980s and spawned a slew of sequels and rip-offs which continue to this day, to a point where the original film has become somewhat lost in the shuffle.

Viewed objectively, FRIDAY THE 13th is perhaps a little too slow-burning for its own good. Victor Miller's one-dimensional script allows the gory murders to punctuate a labored narrative which takes too long in setting out its meagre stall. Too much time is wasted on petty details - characters make coffee, wander in the woods, hunt for snakes in the cabins, etc. - while a ubiquitous Evil Presence lurks ominously nearby. However, once the stage has been set and the mayhem begins, this deceptively simple premise comes into its own, and Cunningham cranks up the tension for a show-stopping finale which raised terrified audiences from their seats duting the film's initial run. Production values are functional but effective, distinguished by Harry Manfredini's instantly recognizable score (""ch-ch-ch!"") - a memorable variation obn PSYCHO's shrieking violins - and Barry Abrams' unobtrusive cinematography, which makes a real virtue of the woodland locations.

The cast includes a young Kevin Bacon and Harry Crosby (Bing's grandson), and Walt Gorney parlays the cliched character of 'Crazy Ralph' (a prophet of doom) into something of a cult figure. But the show belongs to veteran Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees, an old friend of the camp's owner, whose arrival late in the film gives the proceedings a much-needed kick up the backside. Oh, and watch out for Ari Lehman, making the kind of splashy entrance that most other movie stars would kill for...

Over the years, ""Friday"" has been a useful tool for critics to bash the horror genre, citing it as an example of all that's bad in modern moviemaking. Even the trailer seems to have its tongue firmly embedded in its cheek (""You may only see it once, but that will be enough!""). But for all its faults, the film has aged gracefully, and the shocks and scares still have the power to take unwary viewers by surprise.

I'd hate to call these ""Friday"" movies realistic, but in a way they are, as there really are crazy stalkers and psycho killers like Jason out there. Bad blood apparently runs in the Voorhees family, and that makes the shocking conclusion especially creepy for first-time viewers. Too bad Paramount couldn't resist a bit of censorship in the decapitation scene, trimming the gore, no doubt, for the less accustomed ""Scream"" crowd. (-Come on, it's even uncut on the old British video version !.) This unwise behaviour from Paramount, the lack of DVD extras, and the fact that they've never bothered to letterbox it until now, just goes to show that the studio never really cared much for their ""Friday The 13th"" series. Their embarrassment of the series is quite strange, afterall, the movies were extremely succesful world-wide. So what's the idea of trying to make them more accessible to a modern audience this way ?. This is an insult to the true fans, and no better than when George Lucas CGI-messed with his already brilliant 70s hit ""Star Wars"".

Annie's death is completely  missing,Jack's death is trimmed down by 3 minutes and Ms. Voorhees' death  is slightly less violent. The picture quality is awful. It's so grainy it  makes the film look like it was shot on a camcorder. The scenes that have  dark lighting are nearly impossible to see. The sound is REALLY bad. We had  to turn the volume to  maximum level to hear the actors voices and all the  other sounds. There is also a VERY annoying hiss that interrupts every  couple of minutes or so. It sound pretty loud and at times blocks off all  the other sounds. There are practically no extras. All there is a theatrical  trailer and  that's it. No behind the scenes footage,cut scenes, director's  commentary or anything. Overall,this DVD is a HUGE waste of money. It costs  around $22 bucks,and thankfully when we rented it we had a membership  card. Stick with the VHS tape. Trust me. With a horribly grainy  picture,irritating sound (the hiss!),slightly missing footage and almost no  extras,this DVD should go out of print and be re-made. Steer way clear and  stick with the VHS version,please!",962668800,,1597,4.652329749103942

238576,3,6300214087,"Note-the following review contains some plot spoilers,so read carefully.
This movie is OK,but it could've been soooo much better. Now to be fair,this got the whole series started,but the lack of Jason will most  likely bore you. The movie is rather boring at first,but halfway,it gets  interesting. Jack gets an arrow shoved through his neck,Marcie gets axed in  the face and all hell breaks loose. However,the plot is much too slow. The  first time I saw this I almost fell asleep. I was thinking ""this  movie's a waste of time"".I rented it again and thought it was OK. The  last 15 minutes of the film are very intense and the ending is very  eerie. The acting is OK,the plot decent,but where the film really shines in  the gore department. Throat slashings and decaptations galore are one of the  three best features of the film (the last fifteen minutes and the ending  being the others.) Tom Savini did a brilliant job. Harry Manfredini's score  is pretty eerie too. However,despite gore galore,lots of nudity and a cool  ending,the film just isn't that exciting. If you're a big time gore hound  and a Halloween fan,you might like it. It isn't the  Halloween  ""rip-off"" that people say it is. But if you want to see a better  version of this film,I suggest you rent Part 2. It took almost everything  that was wrong with this and improved it. I also highly recommend you check  out Parts 4 and 6 (the best chapters of the series by the way.) Don't get  me wrong,this movie's not bad,but it's too slow and uneventful to be really  interesting. Rated R for gruesome horror violence and an explicit sex  scene.",958780800,5,1613,4.669039145907473
238577,3,6300214087,"In 1979 Sean S. Cunningham was looking to produce a mere potboiler to tide him over until his next serious project. His idea of a Summer Camp Killer movie seemed like a decent, low-budget, one-shot deal and he went with it. There was nothing particularly memorable or unique about it but it was bought by Paramount and released as a mainstream film, rather than a independent struggler. The response was huge and it soon became clear that Friday the 13th was not a mere paycheck but a serious cash-cow. Sequels followed. And the rest is history.

Many, many people claim that Friday the 13th rips off Halloween. Which is not a very fair or kind statement. Sure, it's no work of art and has many similarities, but Halloween was NOT the first slasher movie as Black Christmas and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre came before it. I was actually draw more parallels between this and The Last House on the Left, which was also produced by Cunningham. Friday the 13th is a slicker, tamer film in comparison but if TLHOTL never existed then we would have the Friday the 13th franchise that we have today.

The characters and deaths are not so imaginative. All we really get is throat slashings and impalings. But at least the fodder are not as obnoxious and annoying as they would later become in the sequels, when they truly deserved more grotesque deaths.

At the time, the ending was surprising only because it came out of nowhere. The sudden unveiling of the killer and motives was random and unexpected. It's weird watching it now, knowing that Jason and parts 2-infinity were never planned. Jason was just a dead boy and nothing more.

It's hard to review Friday the 13th on it's own merits rather than the movie that launched a major franchise. A low-brow slasher script made into a potboiler movie that ended up making zillions in sequels, spin-offs, TV series', toys, games and accessories seems so far-fetched.",958003200,17,1909,4.723723723723723

This film is the epitome of lazy, moraless, unsophisticated, and  pitiful filmmaking. Nothing more than a relocated generic remake of John  Carpenter's classic Halloween minus any creativity. Friday bursts with  one-dimensional performances, obvious plot trends, chessy non-thrills,  excessive and unconvincing sex to distract the audience from a lack of a  plot, and an onslaught of dated blood and guts that somehow spawned EIGHT  SEQUELS!  This movie is a shameful excuse for entertainment that is a  disgrace to real moviemakers like Hitchcock and Craven.

Both films were smartly made and deserve equal praise for the genre - the slasher flick - they helped create. I  think the reason Friday the 13th gets such bad press is because the camera  never shys away from the in-your-face gore (especially Annie's  throat-slashing scene). I was lucky enough to see this in the theatre when  it first came out. It was an amazing experience for a 16 year old. To  compare it to a roller coaster ride is an accurate description. When  Adrienne King's character picked up the machete to defend herself from Mrs.  Voorhees at the movie's end, the audience (myself included) was screaming  for blood. Decent acting, effective scares, and a creepy music score make  Friday the 13th more than just a cheap horror film.
