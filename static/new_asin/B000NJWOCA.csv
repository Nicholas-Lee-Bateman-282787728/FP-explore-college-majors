2771628,4,B000NJWOCA,"Good, simple old western takes me back to the 1950's and the Satuday movie matinees.

This movie was of particular interest to me as a ghost town buff, because it was filmed in Kanab Utah.

The story begins when the Three Mesquiteers get paid for delivering cattle. $4,300 is a lot of money for one man to be packing around. Lullaby offers to deposit it in a local bank. When he gets there Lullaby plays three-card monte, the classic rigged gambling game. Does gambling bring in money to build up a town? Shots from the street provides an answer. The Town Council bans the prize fight and orders Barrington to close his business. [Note how a business owner claims what is good for him is also good for the town.] Barrington plans to get even with Thornton the bank owner. Stony and Tucson find Lullaby gambling. At night burglars clean out the banks safe. The bank is ruined. The Three Mesquiteers will try to help. A customer makes a transaction. Tucson will fight to help Thornton. People bet on their chosen winner.

The fight begins, we see many body blows (using doubles). The crowd cheers. Tucson is knocked down. People continue to bet on the fight. How did Jake get that bank money? Tucson wins the fight. They race after Jake before Bucks gang can get him. Jake hides, and makes scary noises to frighten two of the gang. The same screams frighten the others. Sabina and Lullaby find Uncle Jake. Jake has a plan to escape then the bells ring. Stony and Tucson escape with the money sacks. An angry crowd wants to get into the bank. There is shooting in the street. Can Sabina race to town with the money? The Three Mesquiteers grab Barrington and walk in the street to halt the gunfight. This returned money saves the bank. Barrington leaves town quickly.

This story was adapted from a novel by William Colt MacDonald. The robbery of a small bank leads to a local depression (the loss of money). It shows how a sleazy entertainment district harms a town overall. Having a saloon owner as the secret head of an outlaw gang was a recurring theme in the classic westerns of the 1930s. Was this just a fictional notion? Do you know who owns the local gentlemans club in your county? The success of the Three Mesquiteers led to copies like the Rough Riders, Range Riders, and Texas Rangers. They were as good or bad as the originals. Does this formula work today? Just look at popular TV dramas over the years.",1467676800,,2252,4.569306930693069

Quality of their unrestored movie transfers varies from fair to good, based on condition of source material stock (often old 16mm broadcast prints). The only extras provided are a catalog insert and DVD-accessible title list.

The Three Mesquiteers movies were inspired by a number of William Colt MacDonald dime novels. This trio's popularity led to imitations by other studios: Range Busters, Rough Riders, Texas Rangers and lesser three-man oaters all descended from the Mesquiteers.

Although THE THREE MESQUITEERS (1936) is officially the first entry in this series, that honor technically goes to RKO's POWDERSMOKE RANGE (1935). It starred Hoot Gibson as Stony Brooke, Harry Carey as Tucson Smith and 'Big Boy' Williams as Lullaby Joslin. The actual TM series came after the creation of REPUBLIC Pictures that very same year.

Fifty-one Mesquiteer westerns were made by REPUBLIC between 1936 and '43, with the main actors never constant. Stony was played by John Wayne, Tom Tyler and Robert Livingston. Lullaby was variously Jimmie Dodd, Rufe Davis, Sid Saylor or Max Terhune, with Raymond Hatton appearing 9 times as 'Rusty' Joslin. Bob Steele and Ray Corrigan split the Tucson role almost equally. Athough the cast rotated often, one constant was a ventriloquist's dummy named Elmer Sneezeweed.

In GHOST-TOWN GOLD, our heroes try to recover money stolen from the village of Prospect by an outlaw gang. We also learn in this second Mesquiteer picture how Elmer the dummy came to be.

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.
