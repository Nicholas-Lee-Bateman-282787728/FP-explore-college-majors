6446655,5,B00KTZAM0E,"I really love this DVD because it has a lot of different things in it: how to learn the choreos, advices from all the dancers and some sneek peeks from the auddidions.
They all really inspired me.
And not to forget....music from my favourite singer Justin;-)",1410393600,,258,4.630434782608695

6446658,5,B00KTZAM0E,"The Believe Tour Dance Experience DVD is set up in an interesting, easy-to-follow way. ""Chapters"" of the movie alternate between Nick DeMoura, the choreographer, teaching pieces of dance from three different songs and DeMoura and the dancers talking about their training schedule for the tour, how to become a better dancer, and other informative sections.

As DeMoura says, ""All it takes is a lot of hard work and training."" The dance sections, teaching pieces from ""Boyfriend,"" ""As Long As You Love Me,"" and ""Beauty and the Beat,"" feature him going step-by-step, giving you tips to transition between sections and teaching you the lingo they use in rehearsal. These sections can get confusing due to the film facing the dancers, while you're trying to mimic them, which means what you see and what you do are reversed, but it's very fun to follow along with. DeMoura is very encouraging and, while the finished product is much faster than taught, I felt as though I could work my way through it without feeling too silly.

The choreography is amazing. Since I'm not a fan of Justin Bieber's music, I've never seen him perform. But these dance moves are stunning, especially when the dancers perform them at the end like they did on tour. The dances are all very different styles, with one being very robotic feeling, one involving some very pretty partnering, and all three of them flowing nicely.",1409443200,,1399,4.89873417721519

8661517,2,B00KTZAM0E,"The dvd does not give you moves for the whole dance of the song, just sections of the song. They also don't mirror the footage NOR do they show you the moves from an alternative angle, such as from behind. This is a very hard dvd to learn dance moves from, and you only learn a minute from the song (if that). Nick DeMoura is very talented so it is very disappointing that this isn't better.",1443225600,,391,4.157894736842105
