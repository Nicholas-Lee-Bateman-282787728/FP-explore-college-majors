The tape comes in a book like box from Columbia House and is a Warner Home Video, copyrighted 1997.

The episode titles are: The Case of the Talkative Dummy, Shot in the Dark, and The Town That Wasn't.  The box description says the the last title was about crooks who have a portable town with a speed trap to make money in fines and then pack up and leave.
