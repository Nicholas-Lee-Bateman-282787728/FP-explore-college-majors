8157984,5,B000KLPC20,"Advanced Chemical Peels, Vol. 1 is comprehensive and a great tool to review before offering chemical peel services to your clients.  I thought that I was pretty much proficient in chemical peels since I perform them on my clientele on a regular basis, but this video helped me to perform an even better service.  I can't speak more highly of it!  This is a must have for any working professional esthetician looking to stay up to date in this competitive business.",1410566400,4,464,4.703703703703703
8157985,5,B000KLPC20,"This DVD series is more informative and instructive than any classroom I've ever attended.  Unfortunately I attended a terrible school and received little to no actual instruction.

Thanks to Malinda I now understand the science and application of Alpha peels, Beta peels, and how to use them in conjunction with Microdermabrasion to achieve maximum, safe results.  I also learned other gems of information such as the proper application of sunscreen...yes, there is a better way to apply it than just rubbing it on!  There's no substitute for actually watching a live peel in action with an expert discussing the technique step by step.

Yes, the series is a bit pricey, but in this case you get what you pay for.  Malinda's years of experience and in-depth knowledge shine through.  You will be more than compensated for your time and money.",1249603200,4,843,4.978571428571429
