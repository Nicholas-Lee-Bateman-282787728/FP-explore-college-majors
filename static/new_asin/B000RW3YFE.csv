8202734,5,B000RW3YFE,"This was on tv when I was a teenager.  I was delighted to find it on dvd.  Having been a televised acted show, it was great finding it.  My adult children love it, because the format is not usually seen these days.  The grandsons like it because it is different, and they all have asked to see it more than once.",1370563200,,312,4.065573770491803
8202735,5,B000RW3YFE,"what can i say. i just loved this. it was a great example of classic retro television and one of the best fairy tale productions that has been done. i enjoyed it as much or even more than a lot of Shelley Duvall's 'Fairie Tale Theater' shows. and that is saying quite a bit since i think Duvall is a genius with this material. there were times i almost forgot this wasn't a 'Farie Tale Theater'.
  i don't mind productions that are filmed in videotape. i think it often gives the shows a live theater feel that enhances the Broadway stage-like approach. in fact this whole thing pre-dated the Tony Award winning Sondheim Broadway musical 'Into the Woods' by at least a decade. it even was ahead of the Heath Ledger fantasy by Terry Gilliam and strangely shares some of the same approach to interpreting the brothers themselves.
  for me, stuff like this is the ultimate in entertainment. i couldn't have enjoyed the whole thing more.
  this also comes with the adorable Sandy Duncan televised musical of 'Pinocchio' from 1976. Duncan's 'Pinocchio' show comes off as a little bit more campy retro than the 'Grimm Bros.', but it has a truly darling and inoccent approach that keep it fresh and ooky pooky cute. a lot of Duncan's 'Pinoky' is cornball as all heck, but it kept bringing a amused smile to my face throughout and was even funnier than the 'Grimm Bros.' in a campy retro way. after all what can you say about a musical that has simplistic lyrics like, ""that izda earth, and dat izda sky, and that iza a birdie inda sky flyin' by"".
  if you love classic retro television, you'll love this stuff. a must own for nostagia fans. and a giveaway steal at four bucks a DVD.",1327276800,,1675,4.52317880794702
8202736,5,B000RW3YFE,"Saw this when my children were small and was impressed with the quality of the production.  The cast is made up of well known actors from the seventies, and anyone, not only children, can enjoy it.  It was as lovely and humorous as I remembered.",1315699200,4,245,4.4222222222222225

8202738,5,B000RW3YFE,My mom taped this on our Betamax when I was a kid.  I watched it over and over and over again.  I just bought this for my 3 and 4 year old daughters and they love it.  It has all their favorite characters and the stories change every 3-4 minutes so they are never bored.  They don't care that it looks like a made for TV movie from the 70's (which it is).  They are even singing the songs from it.,1218067200,3,397,3.8518518518518516
