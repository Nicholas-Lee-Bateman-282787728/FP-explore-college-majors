My main complaint though, is the dubbing. It is awful and unfortunately a pet hate of mine. I would prefer to see see the non English speaking actors speaking in their native tongue with sub-titles showing. The script is corny and typical of low budget films of that era. The premise is a good one; soldiers from two opposing sides meeting up again after a previous encounter, but the opportunity for an excellent film was lost, in my view, due mainly by the low budget and poor script. This type of thing was dealt with much better in the Lee Marvin film, Hell in the Pacific(?).",1286150400,,752,4.4963503649635035
