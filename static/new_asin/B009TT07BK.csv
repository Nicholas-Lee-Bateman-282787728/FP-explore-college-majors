5368010,3,B009TT07BK,"If Roger Corman movies were rated PG, this is what we'd have--a goreless flick that favors comedy over horror, but still involves monsters abducting women.

Director Ted Nicolaou (Subspecies I-IV, Terror Vision) and writer/producer Charles Band (the Puppet Master, Subspecies, Ghoulies and Trancers franchises) have crafted some truly laughable comedy horror nonsense for us.  In the spirit of Roger Corman, a presumably horny alien and his robot sidekick have come to Earth to steal our women and they're using a local radio station to do it.  However, completely unlike Roger Corman, there is no nudity, no monster-human ""mating"" scenes, no gore, and all of the laughs are deliberate.  In fact, I struggle to understand how this received an R rating.

You might be wondering how this works... Well, first off, everything has to be covered in other-worldly alien fungus...because that makes sense.  Then the alien plays rock music over the air waves and makes attractive young radio fans dance like party girls starring in their own music video until they are miniaturized and teleported into his the alien's collection jars.

By the way, these music videos seem to be the true theme of this movie, because we are forced to watch each one in its entirety.  They're not very good and they last several minutes each.  But I laughed when the scenes cut between the dancing girls' perception of what's going on and the perception of those around them who just think they're nuts dancing like a loon on diner counter tops, during surgery or in the middle of high school band practice.  Keep an eye out for the electric guitar-playing nun and the guy in the cow suit in one of the music videos.

All the while DJ Dan is broadcasting live, narrating all of the transpiring events of this invasion and local listeners just think it's all a hoax.  So Dan has to save the world on his own!  How does he do it?  Some disinfectant spray and a box cutter.  Not since milk defeated the Ernest Scared Stupid Troll has there been such a dumb monster vulnerability.

As a horror superfan, I appreciate that this flick features loads of horror regulars filling the roles of truck stop owner Peanut (Sonny Carl Davis; the Evil Bong franchise, Jersey Shore Shark Attack, Trancers 2), news reporter Lisa Cummings (Martha Quinn; Chopper Chicks in Zombie Town, Dead Heat), station owner Vernon Locknut (Aaron Lustig; Pinocchio's Revenge, Scanner Cop II, Darkman, Ghostbusters 2), abductee Cookie (Charlie Spradling; Puppet Master II, The Blob), Corky (Michael Huddleston; Vampires), abductee Nurse Ginger (Melissa Behr playing the same role she did in Dollman vs Demonic Toys) and Dollman (Tim Thomerson playing the same role he did in Dollman vs Demonic Toys; Trancers).

The effects are extremely cheap, even for a bad horror movie.  There is no gore, some slime and mostly just costume monsters.  Unlike most horror of its time, this was made to be a goreless comedy horror rather than the more typical uber-gory horror comedy.",1380412800,2,3008,4.956175298804781
5368011,3,B009TT07BK,"Saw part of this movie on TV once and always wanted to see the whole thing.  Had music written by Blue Oyster Cult who I like, but these tunes were disappointing.  Campy, typical of Blue Moon movies.  If you've seen and enjoyed other Blue Moon movies (as I have) then you'd probably like this too.",1373760000,,297,4.363636363636363
5368012,3,B009TT07BK,"A back country radio station is about to become the base of operations for a sinister alien being, who plans on using the airwaves to lure voluptuous young women into his evil clutches! How, exactly, does the alien go about collecting these women, you may ask? He transmits radio signals that make them envision themselves in a bad music video before they are shrunk down and teleported into tiny glass vials. Seems simple enough, right? Full Moon brings us another spaced out comedy in BAD CHANNELS, a silly spoof of the invasion movies of the 50s with 1980s sensibilities. Paul Hipp plays our wacky shock jock hero Dangerous Dan with plenty of enthusiasm, bringing life to what could have been an otherwise dull experience. The cleverness of the plot begins and ends with Dangerous Dan's Wellesian attempt to warn the public of their impending doom, then it is right back to rubber monsters and Grade-A cheese. SUBSPECIES director Ted Nicolaou sets the mood for a perfect B-Movie, but, in a fatal flaw, allows the awful music videos to take up more screen time than the alien action. Full Moon fans are sure to relish the droll humor in this goofy comedy, however.

Science fiction with a musical bent.  A UFO has landed and is using a local radio station to kidnap young women by making them smaller and sucking them through the airwaves into them little bottles as shown on the box cover.

Like another reviewer said, I can't believe it was rated ""R"".

Best of all is a cameo from Tim Thomerson as Brick Bardo, from another Full Moon production, Dollman.",1454198400,,505,4.566666666666666

The film stars original MTV video jock (remember when they played videos?)  Martha Quinn, America's girl next door. She plays a TV reporter and while she was my favorite at MTV, she can't act. The film also features a number of bands: Fair Game, D.M.T. and Sykotif Sinfoney in what could pass for videos.  Sound track by Blue Oyster Cult.

This is a cult style film, coming available on mutli-packs. A radio station announces about an alien take over and people believe it is a stunt. Where is Orson Wells when you need him?

Guide: 3 F-bombs. No sex or nudity.",1443830400,,614,4.545454545454546
