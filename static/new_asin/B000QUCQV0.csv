Now, 2 years later, it will be interesting to see what makes up this Series 2 release -- since the series 1 release included several episodes of of the actual series 2.  Too much to hope for the complete fill-in of this compelling drama??",1181606400,12,277,4.3076923076923075
2840192,5,B000QUCQV0,"Excellent, just very sorry I could not get Season ONE. ey did not offer it at the time I bought this one.",1385769600,,105,3.8181818181818183
2840193,2,B000QUCQV0,"while I did enjoy the first season very much, the second season left me wanting.  The stories were short and not really as interesting as the first season.  I was hoping to order the third season but after watching the second season, I think not.",1373760000,,246,4.444444444444445
2840194,4,B000QUCQV0,"Enter the female doctor, but doors close all over. What a shame and certainly expected at the turn of the century. She deals with the situation very well.",1372204800,,154,4.535714285714286
2840195,5,B000QUCQV0,"Jenna Redgrave is fantastic in her role of unusual female Dr in Victorian England. Father also a Dr but her sex keeps her out of the Old Boy club and she opens The Thrift in a run down area to help the poor. Issues cover the harshness of times...babies sent off to workhouse for a terrible cold mean childhood, women dying in childbirth...her own Mum died giving her birth..pre-antibiotic infections...pneumonia killed many patients. Being wealthy was not protection from illness and death...her benefactrice succumbs to ruptured appendix due to arrogance and incompetence of famed Dr.
The costumes, medical equipment and situations are realistic...times were hard and illness was rampant. Good series!",1371686400,3,702,5.333333333333333
2840196,5,B000QUCQV0,Ongoing education on Health Issues  or many years ago. Great watching and excellent acting. Sanitary conditions were really poor at that time.,1365120000,,142,5.454545454545454
2840197,5,B000QUCQV0,Very well done series with Jema Redgrave. Believeable medical situations & great relationship with her Dad. Great costuming & sets.,1360195200,,131,5.6

2840199,5,B000QUCQV0,One of my favorite British shows. Jenna Redgrave is great. She makes me believe she was a real person of that era.,1358812800,,114,4.2272727272727275
2840200,5,B000QUCQV0,"The first 3 seasons are terrific, all fine acting, I loved the nurse tho I can't think of her name, early medicine and how they had to deal with illness before antibiotic's were invented. The first show is one of the best, you can see why women became doctors! There are some bloody scenes tho I expected that, not too bad, this series seemed more real to me. I didn't care for the 4th season, you can be the judge of that.",1344470400,5,423,4.170731707317073
2840201,5,B000QUCQV0,"Note to Editor - Mr. Calder playes her FATHER.  Miss Bramwell is unmairried through season 2.

A touch more graphic than our US programs - even ER.  But very realistic to bring the horrors of medicine - especially at this time.

Interesting drama.  Not a lot of character development - but a fine series - I concur the plots get a bit repetitive - but it is a worhy way to spend your TV time.",1223164800,6,392,4.173333333333333
8197370,5,B000QUCQV0,I loved the 1st session although I had seen the whole series some years ago.  That I got through Netflix.  Since they did not have the second and third sessions and so I bought the one I am currently watching.,1469059200,,209,4.2

8197379,1,B000QUCQV0,"I wrote a review for season one, mistakenly thinking a had purchased season one and two from a third party seller... But I see I was wrong.  I had purchased both from Amazon!  SHAME on Amazon for selling DVDs that are dysfunctional.  ( NO - it was not the DVD player ) .
The DVDs were purchased at Christmas as a gift .... The recipient only just confessed now ( March ) that they were unable to view them, when I offered to also purchase season three and four for their birthday!
Now it is past the return window and I am out $60.00...  Not to mention the recipient had a terrible gift experience.
Even Amazon can't be trusted for quality. Very disappointed !
Maybe Amazon needs to send postage paid return labels included with ALL purchases,  if they can not be counted on to verify quality of the many products they handle.",1395532800,,826,4.372549019607843
