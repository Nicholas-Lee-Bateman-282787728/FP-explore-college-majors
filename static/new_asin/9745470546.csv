However, this earlier work has significant weaknesses - the main protagonist starts off as rather a feeble character, accepting his low social status for a long time. Consequently, the earlier episodes are at times painful to watch. Also,, there is too much melodrama, and even the villains are less convincing than Jang Geum's adversaries, Fairly predictable plot developments. Unlike Jewel in the Palace one wouldn't watch it a second time.",1501113600,,526,5.2

This series was released in the early 90's but only in Korean and Chinese. Now is the chance for the English-speaking public to appreciate this great drama. The price is cheap for its priceless content and possible effects on your life. This series shows one how to live, how to love, and how to accept life. This series also put you in perspective in ancient Korean culture, undeniably very enlightening.",1393632000,,538,4.923076923076923
