Not only was I transported away from the hospital scene, but I also wanted to draw some of the scenery. I couldn't be happier that I found the two DVD's for sale on Amazon. Their purchase would be worth it, even for a non artist, for the breath taking views.",1348531200,2,369,4.138888888888889

NOT!
No wheredoes it say that the artist on Desert Vision is none other than David Lanz and is a video duplicate of his CD by the same name.  So, if you don't know Mr.  Lanz, he is (IMHO) the premire pianist of our age. His many CDs are in my collection and are the best of all my music. Don't take my word for it.  Find his CDs on Amazon and visit his web site [...]
The Desert Visions DVD is great.  Serves well as video/audio background and discussion when friends are relaxing or having dinner at my place.  Try it.  END",960595200,7,632,4.139344262295082
