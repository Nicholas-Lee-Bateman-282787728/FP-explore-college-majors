8154427,5,B000K5X4UI,Still another superb Laurel & Hardy classic.  I just can't get enough of them and their antics.  They keep me laughing when I need it most.  This movie doesn't disappoint.,1503619200,,171,4.633333333333334
8154428,1,B000K5X4UI,"Laurel and Hardy's follow-up to the mediocre ""Great Guns"" (1941) saddles the immortal comedians with depressing material that straitjackets their unique artistry. A product of Fox's rigid studio factory, ""A-Haunting We Will Go"" (1942) finds The Boys playing second fiddle to a low-grade murder mystery. Precious few laughs in the team's worst feature. Despite their variable quality, Stan and Ollie's remaining Fox vehicles were a marked improvement  thanks in part to Malcolm St. Clair's sympathetic direction.",1387324800,,511,5.723684210526316
8154429,5,B000K5X4UI,This was one of the few Laurel and Hardy films to still be pretty good after they no longer worked for The Hal Roach Studio. The transfer seemed okay and there are a couple of extras included.,1360627200,,192,4.216216216216216
8154430,3,B000K5X4UI,"Being that I'm a person who loves horror/comedy combos such as A&C Meet Frankenstein, The Munsters. The Three Stooges' spooky shorts, etc. I wanted to see a Laurel And Hardy film that put them in the setting of a haunted house with ghosts and strange goings ons. Even if it was like Abbott and Costello's Hold That Ghost, I would have been happy with that. Unfortunately that is not the case for this movie. While not a bad movie to watch, it has none of the trappings you would expect to find in a movie of this title. It has no haunted house, no ghosts, no graveyards, no seance, no thunder and lightning, no creaky doors, no cob webs, no howling winds, in fact there are not even any night time scenes. All you get are two coffins. Both of which wind up in the opposite locations of their destinations.",1286064000,2,805,4.373333333333333
