8115514,4,B000EXOAEU,"Alright, so the eye-candy effect that comes with the high-quality animation and topnotch CGI in IGPX has finally worn off on me, and I've come to realize that this anime is actually as simple as they come. The story isn't deep, centering solely around the action, with the characters actually being models of some of the more stereotypical anime roles (hot shot young kid, strong-willed partner, quiet genius), only given enough life to make them enjoyable to watch. But really that's all a sports anime needs, something to get it to the action.

The action in this volume is some of the most intense yet, as Team Satomi must face off against their rival, Team Sledge Mamma in order to earn a birth in the championship match. For Takeshi, though, this match is a little more personal, as he must face his rival and friend, River, who used to be Takeshi's backup on Team Satomi, but who now is the forward of Sledge Mamma. The battle that these two have is intense and surprising, as is the final outcome. From there, I won't go on as I'd hate to spoil this for anyone who hasn't yet seen this series on Cartoon Network. I will say that it continues to get better.

As for the DVD, IGPX probably has the most prolific cast of voice actors to ever grace an anime, and therefore the voice acting is as good as it ever gets for an American dub. With Haley Joel Osmet, Michelle Rodriguez, and Mark Hammel playing key roles, not to mention some anime voice acting favorites like Steven Jay Blum (Spike from Cowboy Bebop), Crispin Freeman (Alucard in Hellsing), and Kari Wahlgren (Haruhara Haruko from FLCL and Fuu from Samurai Champloo), that's obvious. I only wish there were more special features on this disc other than the interview with Mark Hammel, which I enjoyed by the way.

As an action anime, I can honestly say this is one of the best I've seen. It never gets so serious, but it also never tips into the immature. IGPX stays right there in the middle, allowing fans of all types to come and enjoy. Sure, the story isn't very deep--basically, the episodes go in a predictable order, with the pre-race build up, the race itself, and then the post race celebration--but it's definitely enough to carry IGPX from start to finish. If you've been collecting the series on DVD, then I wouldn't stop now. The competition is heating up and the outcome of the championship is about to be decided.",1150588800,,2392,4.58411214953271
