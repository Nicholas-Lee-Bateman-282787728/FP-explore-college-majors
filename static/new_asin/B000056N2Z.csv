1398500,5,B000056N2Z,"It aint no Hollywood glamour film. Some reviewers have deemed too morose but it is life in the real world, whether it's London,New York or Hamilton. Working class life is a struggle for survival wherever you live. This is a family surviving life in London. Both Gina Mckee and Shirley Henderson are great in their roles. And the ending-Awww,it's gorgeous. Well worth viewing.",1151107200,,375,4.968253968253968
1398501,3,B000056N2Z,"This is one of those ""small"" films that I want to like.  But like many ""realistic""  portrayals of working class London, it is just too morose.  Every one of the characters is wallowing in unhappiness. The film is very well made, and you can empathize with several of the characters, but this is too much of a downer.  This version of working class life has been done too many times before.  ""Realistic"" need not always mean ""depressing.""  Think about seeing ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" instead.",1135296000,5,500,4.625
1398502,5,B000056N2Z,"Like the more recent film Code 43, Wonderland is marked by director Michael Winterbottom's realist style. The grainy images of London don't have a tourist brochure look, but they do give you a sense of what it's really like to live there. The characters (three very different sisters and their extended family) are well drawn and compelling, easy to identify with despite their flaws. The strong musical score supports the emotive impact of the film, expressing what the dialogue omits. Overall one is left with the feeling of having looked with compassion into the lives of real people, perhaps gaining insight into one's own situation in the process. The film raises some interesting issues about gender relations, with male characters getting pretty rough treatment and not always deserving it.",1123804800,5,797,5.186046511627907
1398503,3,B000056N2Z,"Britain is captured here in a very delicate, very introspective way. Three sisters battle depression, loneliness, and disgruntled lives. They are trying to make the best of their world without losing sight of themselves. Michael Winterbottom scores well here in this view of life in the seemingly normal streets of London. In the end, they will tackle the pains of one-night stands, the darkness of trying to find purpose, and the grief of watching a loved-one go AWOL.

A good watch if you have time. If not, try something else.

*also of note, a great film score helped bring this movie up a few notches.",1123632000,4,606,4.761904761904762
1398504,4,B000056N2Z,"Watching this film, I was struck at the ambition of the film maker. A small family drama is told in the large scope of a sprawling city. This story of three sisters, their parents, their lovers, and their neighbors is a messy, yet elegantly nuanced slice of life. The acting is natural. No character is perfect and the exposition of the story is quiet and imprecise. The viewer is bound by the small details of the characters' lives. The city of London is not just a landscape, but an entity unto itself, complete with its own music.
  For better of worse, the film lacks centrality and it is hard to empathize with every character. The murkiness of the family backstory is frustrating at times. Attempting to apply a moral construct to every sequence of the film is useless. To me, this movie had strong echoes of Mike Leigh's films.
  Does the movie work? Sort of. Are the charcters revealed in a satisfying manner? Yes. Is the film's arc and execution admirable? Yes. Is the movie enjoyable? Not really.
  The actors did a tremendous job. Gina McKee is fine as Nadya, the emotional touchstone of the film. Canadian Molly Parker does credit to her English accent. My particular favorite performance is that of Shirley Henderson (Bridget Jones, Harry Potter). She is wonderfully natural as the cheerful, tarty single-mom sister.
  All in all, this film is better than fine but not great.",1089244800,11,1388,4.754166666666666
1398505,4,B000056N2Z,"At the beginning , Wonderland doesn't seem to have the right elements in order to fascinate the viewer . It's characters are ordinary , unappealing people : a woman who is so bitter about everything that led her own son away from home , a t.v-salesman who has isolated himself from all the people which surround him that even his own mother can't help but confessing that "" ... It feels like i have a stranger in my own house "" , a divorced hairdresser with a teenage boy and an imature ex-husband she has to put up with . All of them are inperfect , all of them have insecurities and all of them face various kinds of troubles everyday . As minutes go by though something strange happends . Remember those unappealing people we were talking about ? Well , slowly as we get to know them we start to like them . They all feel so familiar to us , they could easily be our next door neighbours . Winterbottom studies his heroes very carefully and manages to capture the feeling of the daily mess we all have faced before . His movie is set in Southern London , a place he presents like it's some kind of a secret garden with lost souls in it trying to find their peace of mind . What makes Wonderland work so well is also the fact that it's being carried by an unfamiliar to most of us yet highly talented group of actors . Some of them had small parts in relatively more known pictures ( N.Hill , Shooting Fish ) , most of them we meet for the first time . Finally the music is absolutely brilliant , especially those wonderfull pianno parts that it's almost impossible to the viewer to imagine Wonderland withought this particular soundtrack .",999043200,11,1642,4.3
1398506,5,B000056N2Z,"Set in south London at the end of the last century, Michael Winterbottom's Wonderland follows a few days in the lives and loves of three twentysomething working-class sisters (Gina Mckee, Shirley Henderson and Canadian actress Molly Parker who are all excellent).  Winterbottom's free-form directorial style is reminiscent of mid-'70's Altman/Rudolph ensemble work like Welcome To L.A.
 And If the intimate use of camera and razor-sharp editing are not enough, Michael Nyman provides the film with one of the best music scores in recent memory (or perhaps since his work on Gattaca).
 Paul Thomas Anderson probably wept  the day he realized just how gracefully one can absorb the spirit of Short Cuts without drifting to the contrived, incoherent excesses of Magnolia.",986083200,3,768,5.375
1398507,5,B000056N2Z,"This may be the best film of 2000 (at least that's when it was released in Australia). Whilst film-makers like P.T. Anderson have made admirable attempts at personal drama in the last few years, and Mike Leigh continues to tell us that no-one suffers like the poor (as if we didn't know that), Michael Winterbottom has re-defined the genres. This is English kitchen sink drama without the tired clichs of class wars, which have seemed a bit anachronistic since the fall of the Tories. Shot in a stunning cinemascope (1:2.35) and available light, with the tiniest of crews, this is London as you've only seen it if you've seen it for yourself. The cast shines. I defy anyone to make it through this film without falling in love with Gina McKee. That's not to say that Shirley Henderson and Molly Parker are anything less than charming. Ian Hart is wonderfully moronic, as Stuart Townsend is wonderfully creepy. Keep an eye out for the beautifully natural performance of David Fahm as Franklyn. Jack Shepherd, Kika Markham and John Simm round out the main cast with equally powerful performances. A great script from first time screen-writer Lawrence Coriat. Michael Nyman turns out his most subtle and restrained music score yet. Michael Winterbottom is turning out to be the Stanley Kubrick of the 21st century. Who else has been able to jump form one genre to another with such ease and grace? This is a compelling film, well worth having your own copy of.",982108800,22,1457,4.808764940239044

7932263,3,B000056N2Z,"Gina McKee (Notting Hill) stars as one of three London sisters. She plays Nadia who is single and childless but plays the dating game. She has two sisters, Molly who is married and expecting a baby and Debbie, a single mother.

The film takes place on a weekend in London. This London is working class London rather than the sightseeing areas. Nadia works as a waitress in a cafe. Debbie is a hairdresser and Molly is a school teacher. Their parents are played by experienced actors, Jack Shepherd and Kika Markham.

The film has some nice moments but it could be better. The audience will wonder what happens to them afterwards. There are plenty of lingering questions.

The DVD doesn't have any extra features so it is only the film.",1435881600,,735,4.638461538461539

7932265,3,B000056N2Z,"I probably would have liked this more 10 years ago.  Since then, digital cameras have given all sorts of actors the chance to develop very ordinary characters going through some personal crisis.  It revolves around three young women dealing with unreliable men and distant parents.  I would have liked more material with the pregnant girl instead of just the last ten minutes.  If there is a message here it's that the person you make a child with is going to be a permanent blessing or a permanent curse so choose wisely!",1385424000,,522,4.7032967032967035
