7464444,5,B0169JWU5S,"SO GOOD!!! I think a lot of people don't understand this film, which is why it tends to be polarizing. But I personally thought it was brilliant. Especially the actor portraying the character of Luka, Adrian James. Not only was he very natural, but he carried the emotional weight of the movie flawlessly. Big things in his future I'm sure. Bravo!!",1452297600,5,348,4.721311475409836

7464446,5,B0169JWU5S,"Brooklyn Bizarre is a film that makes you frown a little, and think, ""wait, what's going on here?"" It is bizarre. But after watching it again with an old friend and discussing the themes and symbolism - it is one of the most interesting and thoughtful movies I've seen in awhile. I absolutely loved it, and would recommend it to anyone who's interested in queer theory and great acting.",1451001600,,386,4.608695652173913
7464447,1,B0169JWU5S,"What I thought would be a great love story or turn into a great love story turned into one of the worst move i'v ever seen the title of the movie is just what is.
My good if I could get my money back I would. Don't get me wrong the acters did there jobs they were very good I don't know if it was the director or just the script. (Don't Waste your money on this one I wish I don't.",1450828800,8,381,3.658536585365854
7464448,2,B0169JWU5S,"Exceptionally disappointing; the acting was exceptional and very believable until the last five minutes when apparently the writers wanted to exhibit the time-worn (& boring) french existential angst that life is meaningless and relationships without merit as reflected in the final pointless and heartless decision of the main character Maurice. What could have been an outstanding and salvific love story ended up being ""clever"" and without merit.",1449532800,23,449,5.7164179104477615

8735987,1,B0169JWU5S,No redeeming qualities in this movie.  More like stream of consciousness novel than storytelling. Purchase a film like Steel which actually tells a thrilling story.,1527206400,,164,5.56

8735991,4,B0169JWU5S,"watching this film for few minute I though that. The lead Actor was a American trying to play a young man from France. I said to my self that his accent was fake. After I finish the film I watch the making of, and behind the scene. I said WOW! This guy is actuality French. His English is GOOD.. I said to my self he had the mannerism down but that FAKE ass French accent has got too go!",1461628800,2,387,3.911392405063291
8735992,1,B0169JWU5S,Disappointing in every way imaginable. I guess the 1 obligatory goes to the hot actors who really just left me frustrated in the end.,1460851200,2,133,4.583333333333333
8735993,3,B0169JWU5S,A really odd movie.,1456617600,,19,4.0
8735994,2,B0169JWU5S,"A French homeless teen displays deep psychological issues after arriving in New York. Actor Pierre Prieur, who is entirely too pretty to be living rough, is the boy adrift on the streets of New York's Brooklyn. He appears to have been in Brooklyn for a while when we first meet him and is quickly 'adopted' by two lesbian club owners with a twisted clientele. As a viewer, the story begins fine but quickly slows to a crawl. There are very odd declarations,  the story halts almost without warning and explanation. So many unanswered questions: How does a homeless teen take-up a membership in a boxing club; The murdered man is never identified or explained; Why does the French boy leave the new family to burn to death in a fire, Why does he get onto a New York subway naked to ride-off in the end.
I didn't expect an Oscar- winning movie, but this was directed so poorly it was a mess.",1455494400,7,889,4.487654320987654
8735995,3,B0169JWU5S,Good acting but the story could have been better.,1453680000,,49,4.555555555555555
