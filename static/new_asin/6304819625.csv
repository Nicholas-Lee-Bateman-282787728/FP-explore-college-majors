935263,3,6304819625,"this is a camp classic - it's a quite a lavish production.
  The print is not great, as Universal seems to have lost the rights. Anyway it's the best one I have seen.
  This movie which was Yvonne DeCarlo's first starring
role, made her a star. She sings one song - the other is dubbed. It really is worth watching.",1244160000,,315,4.2

935265,5,6304819625,"This is the queen of camp classics: Yvonne in her very first starring role looking exotic, breathtakingly beautiful, and showcasing many of her talents. The plot is ludicrous, loosely, very loosely based on the life of notorious dancer Lola Montez, the story carries one from Vienna to San Francisco with many a bump (and grind) along the way. Yvonne plays Anna Marie, a ballerina in the Royal Ballet of Austria, who is secretly in love with a nobleman. He is killed in war, she is duped into becoming a spy and has to flee the country -- so naturally, she turns up on a stagecoach in Arizona. Stranded, she is forced to do her most exotic dance: Salome and the Dance of the Seven Veils. Catching the eye of a passing bandit, she is kidnapped and dragged to the desert where she changes his Confederate heart by singing O Tannenbaum in German. On to San Francisco, where she is preparing for her debut with the San Francisco Ballet, sings an aria or two long the way, and hides out on a boat disguised as a Chinese princess. (I told you the plot was ludicrous) But all is well and she has a happy ending, heading off in a runaway stagecoach with her reformed Confederate bandit.",1212883200,9,1178,4.4837209302325585
935266,1,6304819625,"It's no wonder that Leonard Maltin rated this film a ""bomb.""  It is.  I have the colorized VHS, and that makes things even worse.  The script is written in cliches.  The story is ridiculous, taking place in Europe and in the American West.  (After a 23-hour stage coach ride to the frontier town that was her destination, Yvonne looks clean and refreshed, heavy makeup still perfect.) The ""dancing"" is pathetic, and wholly unerotic.  (At least they taught 23-year-old Yvonne how to bound around on toe shoes.)  The acting is moronic; Rod Cameron especially needed to earn an honest living.  Charles Lamont, the director, did his usual worst.  In short, a ""bomb.""",1173312000,,662,4.891891891891892

935353,5,6304819625,"This has been a favorite movie of mine since I saw it in theaters when I was a child. I was delighted to find it in DVD.

The story is two-fold. It starts with Rod Cameron telling the story of an immigrant dancer mesmerizing a small Arizona town in the late 1800s. The town promptly changes its name to Salome Where She Danced. Then backtracks to when Cameron first came in contact with this same dancer in Austria during a war. The dancer (Yvonne De Carlo in her first role) had fallen in love with the crown prince, and was spying for him. He is killed in action and a letter with information in it from er is discovered and she must flee. Cameron helps her to escape to America.

From there the story goes to San Francisco where De Carlo becomes a sensation--and meets a highwayman who is played by the actor who played the Austrian prince. She immediatly falls in love with the highwayman who looks like her lost love. From there the story progresses through the histor of San Franciso and San Francisco society at the end of the ninetheenth century.

The cast and acting is superb, the dancing lovely, the direcing and scenery excellent, and the story superb. I heartily endorse this movie to anyone who enjoys The Golden Age of Hollywood movies.",1369958400,2,1251,4.502202643171806
935354,5,6304819625,"My first movie 'heartthrobe' at age 10 was Betty Grable in the movie 'Wabash Avenue'(you can buy the poster for this movie but when is the DVD of 'Wabash Avenue' going to be available).  My second 'heartthrobe' was the beautiful Yvonne De Carlo in the movie 'The Desert Hawk' with Richard Greene, and 'Hotel Sahara' with Peter Ustinov.  Number three & four?,  Brigitte Bardot & Marilyn Monroe! for me any movie starring these beautiful stars is great to watch,  if the the story is good and I find it usually is, it's an added bonus for me. Amazon. if you have any infuence with the move producers, will you please ask them to release  'WABASH AVENUE', 'THE DESERT HAWK' and 'HOTEL SAHARA' on DVD.",1342915200,,697,4.588709677419355
935355,2,6304819625,"This vehicle propelled the beautiful Yvonne De Carlo (who doesn't love her?) to fame as she emerges from a clamshell ala Botticelli's Birth of Venus and dances her way from Europe to America. It's loosely based on the life of Lola Montez and Yvonne has some nice outfits. There are nice sets and costumes but script and direction needs work. In all, its a tad below average of a film, unoriginal and a bit silly. I laughed as she danced in front of the ogling cowboys in her green middle-eastern belly dancing outfit. Cultural clash! with the sophisticated Europe lady in the dancing outfit with the naive cowboy onstage! But it's fun! Many DVDs of old classics (pre 1960) still have not been digitally restored  but rely on reasonable prints. So I am used to average quality prints and wouldn't complain if so. However, this DVD product was from a mediocre print, plenty of small scratches, some missing frames, green marks running down the right for 10 seconds in a battle scene, and the color is a bit red and faded. Furthermore, the real horror is Reel Enterprises! -- the distributors -- placing a WATERMARK in the right bottom corner on the entire length of the DVD!! I'm surprised no one else mentioned this (and the RE! copy is definitely shown as the DVD cover on Amazon). It's an amateur production job and to give you an idea, there's NO menu, no chapters in the menu and when you reach the end, the movie loops to the beginning. That's what a low-budget copy does (I know, I burn DVDs). Furthermore, the back of the DVD case gives movie info as b/w and 1936...which are incorrect (movie is in color and made in 1945). So the DVD producers didn't really know what they were doing. Even Amazon's description is incorrectly given as b/w and 56 minutes (ca 85 minutes). I give the movie 2.5 stars out of 5 (I'm partial to Yvonne) and the DVD print is 1.5 stars but due to the watermark, I'd give it 0.5 star out of 5. Only buy if you really want to see Yvonne's first starring role. Ok to rent for $1-2 if you can but otherwise wait til it's on TV or when it's restored. I can't figure out why RE! put a watermark on the DVD....so sad (what were they thinking? No one else does that!!)",1323993600,6,2193,4.428217821782178
935356,3,6304819625,"People who write reviews should watch the movie first. This movie is full length and in colour.

Rod Cameron may not be all that great here but he is a natural when playing traditional western roles. We need Rod Cameron westerns,especially from the mid to late 40's and the 50's. And they need to be remastered and sharpened. Please, somebody. They're worth it. They have good stories and supporting casts.",1300752000,,406,4.8

7878442,4,6304819625,"A dumb story, a truly terrible print, together with a mediocre sound track, of what once was a first class Technicolor product, couldn't hide the incredible beauty of the young Yvonne De Carlo.  The story is not important.  The cast of old time and wonderful character actors are fun and, did I mention, Yvonne De Carlo, radiant and gorgeous, made the time go by very pleasantly, for me.  If breathtakingly gorgeous women are not to your liking, skip this film.  If you can stomach a lousy print and a third rate story but want to see eighty minutes of some fun to watch - old time professional character actors backing up one of the most beautiful woman ever - I recommend this film as time well spent.",1483833600,,703,4.511811023622047

7878445,5,6304819625,"Moving from the ""Student Prince"" to an old western in a nearly seamless story.  A little ""hokey"" and impractical in some places.

7878448,1,6304819625,"Around 1945, when I was about eight, there was--a couple of blocks up the street from my home--a small upright, rectangular billboard which advertised coming attractions at our local movie theatre. ""Salome Where She Danced"" was the one ad that I remember vividly. Oh, how I longed to go to the ""picture show"" to see it. It seemed breathtaking--so exotic, with such a beautiful dancer, Yvonne De Carlo. But, though at the Midway Theatre the children's tickets cost only 9, we couldn't afford it. I never saw it until recently, when I discovered it by accident, streaming on Amazon.

LOL...I should have saved my three bucks. Yvonne De Carlo was a beauty indeed, but could she dance?--no! Could she act?--barely. The movie appeared to be, rather than plotted, a series of shallow vignettes in the travels of this dancer and her lovers on their way to the west coast.

Did they ever get there? I don't know; I didn't feel I could waste any more time on a flick that should have stayed buried.",1413849600,,989,4.67816091954023
