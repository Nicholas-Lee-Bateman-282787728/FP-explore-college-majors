Movie is a great tribute!",1510963200,,282,4.490196078431373

8636512,3,B00HVJZ4MW,"The narrator is so 50's Disney-esque as to be annoying and unbelievable.  I wanted to see the films taken by Martin & Osa Johnson, but the re-enactments distract from the original footage.  I'd really like to see their original films organized as a document of natural history rather than as a biography.",1472256000,2,304,4.826923076923077
