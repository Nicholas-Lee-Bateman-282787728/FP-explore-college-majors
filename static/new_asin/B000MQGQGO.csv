8170895,5,B000MQGQGO,"What's wrong with details? Absolutely nothing. Actually, details are much needed when it comes to foot technique.. Matt Ritter says it best in the DVD, ""We're still learning how to play this thing!"" And he's absolutely right! Getting this DVD was probably the best thing I could do for myself. If you have been struggling with foot technique, this DVD can help demystify a lot of the aspects that go into playing the bass drum efficiently. Playing efficiently translates into good sounding drums, of course. And we all want to sound good, don't we? :)",1345939200,,551,4.810526315789474
8170896,2,B000MQGQGO,"I bought this video to help retrain my bass drum technique.  I for one was very disappointed with the limited scope and how much excruciating detail is put into obvious and natural motions. The video doesn't go into any detail on more advanced applications such as repeated bass drum triplets, 32nd notes, or even touch on double bass drumming.

The instructor talks WAY too much in a very monotone delivery.  For every section, I've had to fast forward just to get to actual playing.  I honestly believe I could get the same info from a shorter presentation on Youtube.

At the same time, I purchased Jojo Mayer's ""Secret Weapons"" to develop hand technique.  Jojo's video is superb and in comparison highlights what little info is in this DVD (but in excruciating detail).",1282176000,2,773,4.818181818181818
8170897,5,B000MQGQGO,"I have been exchanging some ideas with fellow drummers on the subject but Matt took time to research the topic and explained it clearly in this DVD (and also filmed it beautifully). After 30+ years of playing and teaching drums and trying to figure out an optimum way to play the bass drum, this concept put me straight away in the right place.  Whether you use 20 minutes or every second of this video, don't even think twice, grab it! And learn the method, your sound and therefore playing will improve and your back will be forever grateful.",1265241600,2,544,4.551020408163265
8170898,4,B000MQGQGO,"This is one of those videos I would recommend for any drummer who is interested in re-training their base drum technique or for a drummer who is now learning to play.  This DVD along with Jojo's DVD will set a solid foundation for building solid techniques with the hands and with the feet.

As mentioned with the other review my only con with the video is that it does tend to draw out a quite a bit but that's pretty much it.",1241654400,,427,4.195121951219512
8170899,4,B000MQGQGO,"Many, perhaps most ""self-taught"" kit drummers tend to ""learn"" to play the bass drum by burying the beater into the head when in the resting position.  This is an entirely effective, but not very flexible technique. There are very very few instructional DVDs that deal with bass drum techniques.  The techniques Mr. Ritter proposes are well described, effective, and provide a lot more flexibility and technical capacity that the simple ""burying the beater"" approach.  The DVD is professional produced with excellent video and sound quality.  Matt is organized and presents his points clearly with a fair amount of repitition.  The content is quite good and HIGHLY recommended for those starting or re-learning bass drum techniques.  Minor (really picky) critiques are that the production is a bit lengthy. There are only about 20 minutes of real ""meaty"" info; expanded to an hour or so on the DVD.  The geometry, physics, and biomechanical explanations of things are often incorrect, BUT the techniques work as described.  I couldn't rate this DVD as high as JoJo Mayer's DVD (another must have), but I would consider this an extremely valuable instructional DVD for beginner to intermediate or even ""early"" advanced players.",1198022400,4,1225,5.214285714285714
