8296779,5,B001E6Q0LW,"Youll love this if you enjoyed The Young Ones. Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson are perfect together as the Dangerous Brothers. Outrageous British humor taken from skits done by the two actors on the Saturday Live television show, this DVD is just hilarious. The chemistry between the two is perfect and that is what makes their humor work so well.

Be warned however, it is loaded with violent slapstick humor and many other over the top things you won't see on American TV.  No nudity but some of the skits are rather risqu in dress, language and behavior.

These skits were released as a VHS tape back in the late 80s/early 90s for the US market back in the day and I wore the tape out watching it so much. Unfortunately it seems to only be available now as a region 2 DVD but that isn't a problem if you have a region free DVD player.

The only issue I had with it was the DVD case. The spindle clips that hold the DVD in place are an odd style and it is very difficult to get the DVD released. The fix for that is simply to put it into another case with a more traditional spindle clip that releases the DVD easily.",1430092800,,1119,4.23943661971831
