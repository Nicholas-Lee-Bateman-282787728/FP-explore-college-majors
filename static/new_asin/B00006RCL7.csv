8434225,2,B00006RCL7,"Howard is a great singer and I'm a big fan not only for his Shalamar period but also recent projects like the one that can be found on Rick James' Deeper Still. However this DVD is somewhat dissapointing in more than one way. First, Howard can be seen on stage along with a bunch of musicians for an audience of about 40 people, sitting at small tables (like a dinnerconcert), probably his family and friends. Second, Howard is not singing live!!! It is just playback. And that is the real problem you're facing when watching this DVD: Truly good singers like Howard cannot stage a live performance keeping their lips in sync while the tape is running. They only know well how to sing for real. In this DVD you will see Howard waving his mic and still keep getting out exactly the same volume of it. You better spent money on truly great live-performances. One of my favourites lately has been the concert of Chic in Paradiso Amsterdam. Amazing performance. 200% live. Howard, have your production team take a look at that!",1207699200,5,1023,4.595628415300546
8434226,1,B00006RCL7,"I can't believe what the other 2 reviewers are writing, it seems like they never attended a live performance! This is NO LIVE AUDIO on that DVD!!!! It is a very sad effort to mix some handclapping people to some studio-recorded music. Don't get me wrong, I'm probably the biggest Howard Hewett fan on the planet, but I just can't stand any fake action and thinking of the talent of Howard, he shouldn't have done that to his fans. Sorry to say that, but any fan should buy the CD's, because at least, you get what's written on the cover. I saw Howard live in 1995, he is the bomb!! So please, give us a REAL LIVE RECORDING soon, Howard!!!",1050451200,7,638,4.325
8434227,5,B00006RCL7,"...and from the heart (and from God) is where this project is coming from.  Howard Hewett has delivered once again! This DVD offers more than live performances, it offers the multi-dimensional being of the man himself...his spiritual ""journey"" if you will... Mr. Hewett gives his all as he shares with us his music, his life, and his spirit through song, pictures and words. He even performs his signature song ""Say Amen"", which is a bonus to those who have loved the song since it's release early in his solo career. All of the songs show, without a doubt his heartfelt spirit and extraordinary talent. If you thought you knew Howard Hewett before...this is a must-have to get to know him better! It is truly a blessing to all who listens to the journey...straight from his heart...",1040342400,,783,4.757352941176471
8434228,5,B00006RCL7,"Howard Hewett delivers again!  Fans of great soul music should not miss adding this DVD to their collections. The presentation personifies Howard to a ""T"": graceful, unpretentious, spiritual, and honest. Along with typically laid-back on stage performances at Storyville, ""Journey Live"" features some great family photos that I've never seen (and I've been an avid fan for over a decade) as well as a cool interview sequence.  Howard's DVD leaves you feeling like you've shared a few special moments with a member of the family instead of with some pre-packaged, uninteresting celebrity.  If you enjoy touching, inspiritual music from down-to-earth true ""artists"", choose this DVD.",1038700800,,681,5.466666666666667
