5011872,1,B006P1YS56,"If you'd filmed the game with the camera Zapruder used on Kennedy ... while working a jackhammer ... on a trampoline ... in the snow, you'd have a better looking picture than this DVD.

I'm glad I watched the game 5 times on ESPN3, cuz those memories are all I'm gonna have of Bama's dominance.  Until their next Championship.  :)

Boooooooooooooooooo to this DVD.  Booooooooooooooooooooo, booooooooooooooooooo, BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!",1330387200,11,447,5.611940298507463
5011873,1,B006P1YS56,Horrible Video quality.  so fuzzy that you cannot see the jersey numbers at times.  Field lines are in double vision and are constantly moving.  Don't buy this video.,1330300800,9,166,4.857142857142857
5011874,1,B006P1YS56,The quality of this recording is terrible.  I can't believe the BCS would knowingly license a DVD this poor. It's a real stretch giving it even one star.,1330214400,15,153,4.464285714285714
5011875,1,B006P1YS56,"I was excited about being able to have this game on DVD (especially since I was actually there).  However, I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the video.  Atrocious.  Its like I am watching something in lower resolution on YouTube.  I had previously downloaded a HD copy from iTunes and the quality is much better.  This DVD was produced by XO Digital and they apparently have the exclusive rights to the BCS and SEC game reproductions.  XO clearly dropped the ball and has put forth a very poor quality product apparently in an effort to make a quick buck from the fans.  To make matters worse, the DVD could not be detected and was unplayable by the DVD drive of my new Dell laptop.",1330128000,16,694,4.504
5011876,5,B006P1YS56,Haven't received yet - BUT I am sure I will enjoy it as much as I did the first time I watched it!,1326672000,4,98,3.3043478260869565
5011877,3,B006P1YS56,Great game but it was not offered in the blue ray or the combo pack...  Good picture.  Blue ray has better picture..,1367193600,,116,4.2272727272727275
5011878,5,B006P1YS56,"Roll Tide! The extra coverage at the end is worth the price of admission. Bought this for my brother, I already had it my collection",1366243200,,132,4.32
5011879,5,B006P1YS56,I read many critical reviews about the lack of quality of the DVD but my copy was fine.  All the plays were there and it was a clear picture.  The entire game took just 2 hours to watch.,1364428800,,186,3.8684210526315788
5011880,5,B006P1YS56,"Really happy with receiving both a DVD and BluRay. The format layout of the whole sequence of the game is really good. The high def looks awesome. Is something to cherish for years to come being able to review the humiliation that was routed upon the supposed ""fighting Irish"". Roll Tide!",1362960000,,288,4.666666666666667
5011881,1,B006P1YS56,"Shame on these people for releasing such a bad quality video. While I enjoyed the game, I will find another version of it to enjoy and will discard this one.
Beware future videos from them.",1361750400,,189,4.428571428571429
5011882,2,B006P1YS56,"first of all, why is there no blu-ray of this game, yet? i have the blu-ray of the 2010 bcs championship game (and will be ordering the one for the 2013 game) and was hoping for a blu-ray of this game as well. alas, no such luck. i'm still holing out hope that there will be one.

but on to the quality of this dvd.....

for a dvd, it's not totally unwatchable. i use a ps3 to watch blu-rays so the up-scaling of dvds is pretty good. however, this dvd looks worse than all the other dvds i own (of things that aren't on blu yet.)
in my experience, it's not as bad as some have stated in that i can see the number on the jerseys just fine and the lines on the field aren't as fuzzy as some have stated.

BUT!

it is pretty bad, even for a dvd. i gave it 2 stars from my perspective as that's what everyone does. not everyone uses the exact same blu-ray player to watch blus/dvds so they will certainly get different results when viewing lower quality video. but even with the power of the ps3 and its up-scaling abilities, it's still pretty bad.

again, why is there no blu-ray of this game? c'mon xos, get with it already! the one for 2013 is on blu and it's done by xos. but not this one or the others they've put out. color be confuse as hell.",1359244800,,1245,4.0653061224489795
5011883,5,B006P1YS56,"My grandson wanted this with the regular season , but it was never put together .  I promised this to him. He loves it.",1356912000,,119,3.9583333333333335
5011884,1,B006P1YS56,"To confirm what all the other reviewers have said, this is the worst DVD of a live action event I have ever seen.

1. Long shots are extremely fuzzy, with the look of a very old and degraded VHS tape shot on extended play mode. On kickoffs, for example the players' legs as they are running are just blurs of white, and not because they are running so fast you can't see their legs move.

2. The action is jerky. Not from time to time, it is jerky constantly. You don't go for more than a very few seconds at a time without a noticeable skip in the video. It is even worse on long shots of teams going into and out of huddles, where they literally jump from spot to spot, completely skipping two to three steps that the players are making on their way from the huddle to the line of scrimmage, for example.

3. The entire game has obviously been time compressed. That's part of the problem with the jerkiness in number 2. However, it also makes the announcers voices sound odd, with occasional skips in the middle of their words. This also has the odd effect of making the slow motion replays look full speed. LOL

So when you have a time compressed game presented in obviously the lowest possible resolution, you have one extremely annoying video to watch. How they could get away with this, I don't know. I hope everyone who gets sucked into buying this video returns it. I had read of these problems and took the video off my wish list. Unfortunately my wife had previously seen it there and ordered it in secret for my birthday. If Amazon will take it back, they are going to get it back.

I'm also going to see of there is some contact information for BCS licensing, and if I can find such, send a copy of all these reviews to them. This game deserves to eventually have a competent release. Football games that I've dubbed down to a Panasonic DVR and burned to regular computer DVDs look twice as good as this. I have several other football game DVDs, and none look like this.

As of this time, our only hope of getting a watchable video of this game is to find something like an ESPNU re-broadcast and DVR that.

What a disappointment. What a waste.

MINUS five stars, if I could select that.

If I haven't yet been clear, DO NOT purchase this DVD no matter how much you want to watch this game again.",1341532800,6,2308,4.324074074074074
5011885,3,B006P1YS56,"The content of the DVD was good, short pregame chat between Herbstreit and Musburger, with the presentation of the trophy at the conclusion of the game. The picture quality of the the DVD was poor, leaving me with a less than satisfied feeling, therefore the three star rating. It seems to me the whites are too bright and the darker colors are much too dark, and with much adjusting of color level, sharpness, tint, brightness, and contrast, I was able to find a somewhat happy medium but not a very satisfactory one. In all fairness, it's not as bad as some reviews have made it out to be, but it's not the best picture either. Hope this review helps.",1339027200,,653,4.495798319327731
5011886,2,B006P1YS56,"Everyone is right.  The quality is not great ... more like a good VHS tape.  But the game is all there and it is all complete.

If you want a high-definition version, download the one from i-tunes.  It is only $3.99.  The quality is great! It was available weeks before the DVD was cut and I downloaded it to my i-pad, which I could then watch through my TV in high-def.  (Beware though; the file is 4GB and takes a very long time to download.)  -- ROLL TIDE!",1335225600,3,459,4.1477272727272725
5011887,4,B006P1YS56,"What an amazing game, holy cow. Never before has there been a shutout in a BCS Championship game. Roll TIDE! The video quality on this DVD wasn't the greatest, but that's probably because this is way longer than a regular hollywood movie so there's more stuff that you have to pack onto one DVD. I have the 2009 Alabama championship on DVD too and it looks about the same. I think some of these reviews are not accurate. It was a great game, and I still enjoyed rewatching it.",1330905600,,476,4.359550561797753
5011888,1,B006P1YS56,Very disappointing. The video quality of this DVD is very bad. There is lots of pixelation. I really hope there is a better option out there for DVD purchase or download.,1330646400,5,170,4.516129032258065
5011889,1,B006P1YS56,"What every review states negativly about this video is true, plus one more thing...The video quality sucks wookie!
This looks TOTALLY amature.  The close ups are clear but footage from a distance is fuzzy and grainy.  It looks bootlegged.  Since it is not trademarked by ESPN, that says it all.  It blows!  Even the jacket is flimsy and cheap.  Was this crap made in China?
It deserves ZERO stars.",1330560000,2,397,4.681159420289855
5011890,1,B006P1YS56,"You read the reviews... they are ALL correct!!  I can only add... the picture is WORSE than when you use to copy games on videotape using 6-hr recording speed.

5011891,1,B006P1YS56,"Must be a bunch of LSU folks working over at XO Sports Productions. I'd blurr the image as much as possible to forget the pain as well. Seriously, how could something this bad even make it off of the production line and even listed on Amazon for sale!!?? Yep, everyone is right - buy the HD version on iTunes.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot -- ROLL TIDE!!!!!!!!",1330473600,2,356,4.313432835820896
5011892,1,B006P1YS56,"Very poor video quality.  While I didn't expect it to be Bluray, I did expect it to be better than SD.  It's like looking through a fishbowl.  A rip-off.  Don't waste your money.  There is no excuse for selling a product with this poor quality.  Notice the rater who gave it 5 stars did so before even seeing it.  Duh!  It might be closer to okay if you have a small screen, but on a large screen it is a huge disappointment.",1330473600,3,425,4.097560975609756
5011893,1,B006P1YS56,if it was a 1998 Jefferson Pilot broadcast. It was like watching the game through a dirty windshield. Was a 14 year old Korean kid recording this with a should mounted VHS camera? Someone just failed their 11th grade communications project.,1330473600,5,240,4.878048780487805
5011894,1,B006P1YS56,It seems that with the exception of one or two plays the entire game was played on the LSU side of the 50 yard line? Can anyone explain this?,1330387200,3,141,3.896551724137931
5011895,1,B006P1YS56,"Like you can see from the other reviews, this is such a terrible looking DVD. It's so bad I thought my player was messing up. I honestly can't believe that XOS Sports and the BCS would allow a product that is this bad to ever reach the shelves of the retailers. It's an embarrassment to them. It's so painfully obvious that this was never watched before the final was approved for mass production. I haven't looked at the other reviews for bowl games from this year, but for the unfortunate 'Bama fans who purchased this hoping to re-live that wonderful night in high quality video, there was nothing but disappointment when they put this disc in.",1330387200,7,647,4.586206896551724
5011896,1,B006P1YS56,"I agree with the other comments about poor video quality.
