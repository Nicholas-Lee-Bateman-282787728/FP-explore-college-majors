933680,2,6304795203,While the overall theme was interesting (a ghost from the days of slavery inhabiting a house) the film maker did a poor job at the film and I had a very difficult time keeping the attention of my 8th graders.,1273622400,,208,4.225

933683,3,6304795203,"This is a very strange movie with elements of history, some comedy and horror. I remembered being scared of it as a kid, and as an adult I can still appreciate this film.

It's basically the story of a young black man and his family who move into a historic house that was owned by Dies Drear, a Dutch abolitionist who hid slaves and helped them escape to freedom. There is a rumored treasure hidden somewhere on the land. The family soon begins to suspect that the ghosts of slaves who passed through there are haunting the house when they meet a strange man who seems to know many secrets.",1139702400,,591,4.372727272727273
933684,5,6304795203,"I had never heard of this movie before; then one day when I was Substiute teaching, teh class was watching this.  The kids Loved it; and I was interested too.  I unfortunately didn't get to see the rest; but the next year In my own class room; I tracked this movie down. My students LOVED it.  Scary enough to be fun; but family friendly.  The effects are low budget; but this is great and educational.

I reccomend this for anyone who likes to watch fun Kid level Scary movies; this is GREAT.  Also check out ""Something Wicked This Way Comes.""",1130112000,3,544,4.39

933762,5,6304795203,"I showed this to my students (7th grade) bc we were studying slavery/abolitionists.  There aren't a ton of good facts, and I don't know how educational it ended up being, but I generated some good discussion questions and made it work.  The kids LOVED it.  It was so incredibly 80's...from the acting to the background music.  I don't think I'd enjoy it on a personal level...say to watch it at my house, but it was a gem in my social studies classroom.",1401753600,,453,4.487804878048781

933764,5,6304795203,I use this DVD in my classroom yearly.  It's a good way to introduce the students to historical fiction and to motivate them to research the underground railroad and the role many people played in helping slaves to freedom.,1387238400,,223,4.717948717948718

933766,5,6304795203,This tape was simply magnificent. My young people were spelled bound from the very beginning of the movie. They also loved the way the music always introducted something that would be exciting coming up. They have asked for more of this type of movie. I know that there is a sequel to this book and would like to let them view this also... Mystery at Drear House. Our young people were introduced to things that they had heard of but never witness on screen. By viewing this they got a better understanding of how things happened back then.  They also learned that bad doesn't always pay off.,1350000000,,592,4.5327102803738315
