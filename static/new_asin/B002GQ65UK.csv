8369922,1,B002GQ65UK,"I've bought ""your first real Dance Class No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3-
and have also payed the tax for Germany and shipping.
All the three DVD's are absolutly idendity - and there is no difference
between no. 1 and no. 2 and no. 3 - the context is always the same.!!!
I can' t believe it. So No. 2 and No. 3  can I throw away.
It's probably a mistake in producing ???
I'am very disapointed.... I' ve depended too much money !!!",1271116800,,421,3.9529411764705884

The Hamster Dance is her Favorite.  I look forward to more 'dance classes' with Tanya and Louis McKay!",1247184000,,260,4.608695652173913
