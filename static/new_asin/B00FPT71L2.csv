8617752,5,B00FPT71L2,The ABA was around before ESPN and cable TV so thank you for providing these golden highlights of some great teams and players.,1500336000,,127,4.565217391304348
8617753,3,B00FPT71L2,"When I was in college, his nickname wasn't Marvin ""Bad News"" Barnes but Marvin ""Tire Iron"" Barnes.  Do some research to find out why.

Barnes indeed had exceptional talent, and the very good Providence Friars team he was on that also had Ernie DiGregorio at shooting guard and Dave Gavitt as head coach was knocked out of the NCAA tournament by N.C. State and the super-gifted David Thompson.  You know the rest.",1457568000,,412,4.694444444444445

8617755,2,B00FPT71L2,"30 for 30: Free Spirits was a boring documentary about the Spirits of St. Louis during the ABA. It was mostly guys, especially Marvin ""Bad News"" Barnes, reminiscing about their playing days. The only real accomplishment the team had was knocking the Dr. J led New York Nets out of the playoffs in the first round. One interviewee correctly described the team as a ""failed greatness."" Marvin unsurprisingly died last fall from years of drug abuse. Honestly, ESPN should have selected Dr. J as the topic. All in all, if you want to see the best documentary about ABA, then do yourself a favor by going to youtube and checking out ""Long Shots: The Life and Times of the American Basketball Association"" which was on HBO about 20 years ago.",1425340800,4,736,4.6692307692307695
8617756,5,B00FPT71L2,I really enjoyed this film and it game me more insight into what it was like to watch ABA basketball.,1419292800,,101,4.1
8617757,5,B00FPT71L2,"I love stories about the American Basketball Association. It was the forerunner of the modern NBA, and yet it had its own unique vibe. There is footage here that made my jaw drop. One of the many problems of the league is that there isn't a lot of actual game footage that survived, especially broadcast videotape. I don't know what archive they tapped to find some of this, but I hope it opens up again.",1404432000,3,404,4.4
