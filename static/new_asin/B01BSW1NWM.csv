7666451,4,B01BSW1NWM,"It's finally nice to see Michael enjoying himself on stage after all these years. Songs are tight,playing is spot on and of course Schenker's guitar is melodic as hell. The video is good also.",1465430400,,192,4.676470588235294
7666452,3,B01BSW1NWM,"Performance=Good (I am a huge fan of Scorps, UFO, MSG, TOR - have been for decades and have many albums, CDs and DVDs)
Sound Quality=Fair
Video= ABSOLUTELY THE WORST!
OK video quality is fine, but the camera editing is GARBAGE.
Who did they get to do the video editing, monkeys? Meth heads? What a joke! Camera changes every 1-3 seconds. Go ahead, watch it again and count them. How effing annoying to watch! I would like to watch a performer for more than 2 seconds doing a riff, or a drum sequence, or a keyboard solo, or a wide pan of the band jamming, jeez, anything. And Wayne hardly gets filmed at all. Whats up with that? He is very talented and at least 1/4th of this band. I want my money back. Schenker you need to fire these knuckleheads.",1463529600,5,749,4.357142857142857

7666454,5,B01BSW1NWM,"Wow, great DVD.  Awesome set list, the playing is spot on.  Every live DVD he puts out seems to get better and better.  I highly recommend this!  I pre-ordered it and was very pleasantly surprised that it was delivered by the USPS on Sunday.  The guitar solo on Rock Bottom alone is worth the price of the DVD...",1462752000,3,312,4.310344827586207

7666461,5,B01BSW1NWM,"I own a lot of concert videos. This is hands down the best combo of pq and aq I've ever seen. I am a huge Schenker fan and I'm telling you I could watch this show every day and not get tired of it. I have a full blown Atmos setup with 4 subs and this disc rocks the house, especially when Herman kicks that bass drum. Highly recommended.",1467936000,,337,3.898550724637681
7666462,5,B01BSW1NWM,"This is a incredible  bluray  concert with  excellent  picture and sound. The pic  is clear and the audio has three options  1. Dolby Atmos
2. Dolby True 5.1 3. Pcm stereo  I went with  atmos and it sounded  awesome I love the concerts recorded like this I have Roger waters the wall that was a awesome  bluray  also . Well back to micheal  schenker temple of  rock  bluray  the vocals  were clear all the  guitar  and  drum and bass and keyboards were  clear I love the 7.1 and atmos concerts they have finally done more of these mixes on concerts. The movies are great but on a concert it brings a whole new rely to them. I am  very happy with my  purchase.",1466985600,4,659,4.186991869918699

8751209,5,B01BSW1NWM,"This is the best msg concert i've ever seen, the groove was so tight and michael's freeflow musical playing was awesome, that's why he's always fun to watch cause he doesn't play stiff memorized note for note off the record solos, his live playing is more alive and the band plays off each other more. This is way better than the moody blues or eric clapton or joe bonamassa, the musicianship in this was at a higher level and that ""grandpa drummer"" as the one reviewer called him, was one of the reasons this kicked-A so much,herman rarebell is one of the all time greats, so tight with francis buchold and herman together and that other guitar/keys dude is one badass musician too, and i liked the singer a lot, he has a cool timbre to his voice, if he could hit higher more perfect notes like geoff tate used to, he would be better and if him and michael could write better songs it would be way better, michaels old songs are so much better than the newer ones.",1521158400,,965,4.366666666666666
8751210,1,B01BSW1NWM,"For Christ's sake, if you're going to film a concert, then there were two very important things that Michael should have done 1) Ditch the annoying, pathetic singer for one that looked a bit more in shape or at the very least made this porker lose 75 lbs, at least and 2) have a drummer that doesn't look like my grandmother, one stronger that was at least 50 years younger. Then I'd have given this show all 5 stars and then some. But, this one was so hard to watch, so hard because Michael should be more wary of these things. For God's sake, your reputation is on the line here!!",1519862400,,582,4.252252252252252
8751211,3,B01BSW1NWM,"So so.  After seeing Led Zeppelin,  The Moody Blues, Eric Clapton, Pink Floyd and Leon Russell in the 70's, and Joe Bonamassa last August, not on their level.",1515283200,,158,4.607142857142857

8751213,5,B01BSW1NWM,"I received this 4K Ultra DVD in 3 days on Prime 2 day shipment. Then when Inwas excited to see and hear it on my 75 Samsung QLED HDTV and Samsung Ultra HD  Bluray player, I found out only the Stereo option worked and the Dolby 5.1 HD and Dolby Atmos both in Stereo and less sound than the Real Stereo option. So I have a replacement coming and hopefully is not symptomatic of this production run. I received the replacement dvd and found out it was in fact  a glitch in my receiver I fixed and after watching the entire concert I have to say it is the Best produced concert DVD audio and Live feel picture front row  I have as well as the best Concert performance!! You won""t be Disappointed!!! 5 STAR",1506902400,,701,4.177777777777778
8751214,4,B01BSW1NWM,Nice concert of Michael. Dolby Atmos is very nice .... but the video is only SDR and not HDR. I wish they had made it HDR instead.,1500163200,2,130,3.8518518518518516
