3161695,5,B0016MOWPU,"Terrific box set! Hopefully it will lead to a third with Lloyds of London, Suez, Pony Soldier, King of the Khyber Rifles, and Untamed. The more Tyrone Power, the better.",1217462400,11,169,4.666666666666667
3161696,5,B0016MOWPU,"Tyrone Power made 52 movies, and appeared in a wide variety of radio and stage work. He died tragically in his mid-40s and at the height of his career, his haunted, almost too pretty looks, all but hiding a formidable talent. While this new collection only hints at the strength and genius to come in such films as Nightmare Alley, The Sun Also Rises and Witness for the Prosecution, these earlier films are also a fair example of the middle-of-the-road Fox releases before and after the Second World War---popular, carefully constructed illustrations of mass entertainment and escapism.
The collection contains 10 films Power made between 1938-1951 as a Fox contract player, and his steady rise to film stardom is more than apparent here. Each film suggests a decided growth in Power's talent, from supporting player in Girls Dormitory to Loretta Young's love interest in three fluffy comedies---Love is News, Cafe Metropole and Second Honeymoon. Following his success with the proto-noir Johnny Apollo, he landed This Above All, an epic wartime romance then Daytime Wife, a flick that teams Power with Linda Darnell, who's stunningly beautiful in her first leading role. In Luck of the Irish, a whimsical leprechaun played by Cecil Kellaway, helps Power woo Anne Baxter. In That Wonderful Urge, Power joins Gene Tierney for romance, and finally, he teams with Ann Blyth for the multi-period costume drama I'll Never Forget You. Power died of a heart attack in 1958, and few performers today could even think of eclipsing---or even equaling---his style, good looks or talent.",1217116800,20,1576,5.136186770428016
3161697,5,B0016MOWPU,"Tyrone Power died on November 15, 1958.  In 2007, 20th Century Fox released a five-disk set of Power's swashbuckler films and was overwhelmed by its success - so overwhelmed, in fact, that a year later, they are following it up with 10 more films, the majority of which are from Power's early days at the studio where he spent about 17 years of his 22-year career.

In addition, Power's anniversary is due to be celebrated at the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles in November, with tributes at the Film Society of Lincoln Center and in his home town of Cincinnati to follow.  It's probably not enough for a tremendous star who doesn't benefit from Turner Classic Movies network or books because TCM doesn't own his films, and it's definitely not enough for this highly underrated actor whose breathtaking looks received most of the reviews.

This second collection, the ""Matinee Idol"" collection consists of Girls Dormitory, in which he has a small role but received most adulation on the preview cards.  It's said that Hedda Hopper sat through the film twice to make sure she had his name right.  Next is Love is News, a wonderful film showing Power's ability at comedy; Cafe Metropole, a delicious Lubitsch-like comedy; Second Honeymoon, a ""Private Lives"" takeoff about the beautiful people - Love is News, Cafe Metropole and Second Honeymoon all co-star Loretta Young; Daytime Wife, costarring a very young Linda Darnell, a rather flimsy comedy also starring Warren William (this light film is said to be Power's punishment for defying the studio and marrying his first wife, Annabella). Gangster drama Johnny Apollo rounds out the '40s, Power costarring with the lovely Dorothy Lamour.

This Above All was based on the best-seller by Eric Knight, and although all the hot sex was removed from the film, it still holds up as a war drama and wonderful acting vehicle for Power and Joan Fontaine.  Jeanine Basinger, author of ""The Star Machine"" feels this film could have helped Power turn a corner into more dramatic acting had not World War II intervened.  Post-war, a remake of Love is News with Gene Tierney, That Wonderful Urge; Luck of the Irish, a sprightly comedy popular around St. Pat's Day, and I'll Never Forget You, which hasn't been seen in decades due to legal problems.  It has been one of the most requested films to be put on DVD for several years.

Features include a career retrospective, a scene cut from Cafe Metropole, Judy Lewis talking about her mother Loretta Young's relationship with Tyrone Power, and a film narrated by two of Power's children.

Discontented with Hollywood, Power went on to distinguish himself in theater in London and on Broadway.  He made some of his best films away from 20th Century Fox, particularly Witness for the Prosecution, Abandon Ship, The Eddy Duchin Story and The Long Gray Line. Today, Tyrone Power is still one of the top 100 box office stars of all time, a list that includes stars up to the present time, such as Depp, DeCaprio, and Clooney. It is estimated that Power's films grossed $1 billion during decades when films cost a nickel, a dime, a quarter and at the time of his death, an average price of $.68. That's a lot of people - and a lot of popcorn.  He remains today in the top 100 all time box office stars according to Quigley, and that includes modern-day stars such as DiCaprio and Depp.",1209168000,116,3364,4.787564766839378
3161698,5,B0016MOWPU,"Last year's volume one of Tyrone Power movies did very well, and Fox is giving us another box set of Power's films as a result. This contains some of Power's less remembered films and is completely absent the swashbuckling roles that dominated the first set.

Luck of the Irish (1948) American Steven Fitzgerald is visiting Ireland when he meets a beautiful Irish girl. However, Steven is ambitious and he has a chance to marry the boss' daughter back in America with all of the priveleges such a union would entail. What will he do?

Johnny Apollo (1940) In the title role Power is the son of a man who is embarrassingly guilty of stealing from his corporation's shareholders. With his father in prison and the money all gone, Power's character is also labeled as untrustworthy because of his father's behavior, and thus he cannot find a job. He takes up with gangsters and eventually ends up in prison next to dad. Will he turn his life around or attempt escape?

Day-Time Wife (1939) Power plays Ken Norton and Linda Darnell plays his wife Jane. Jane finds out that Ken is stepping out with his secretary. Jane is determined to find out what these men see in their secretaries and takes a job as one herself, always making excuses for her daytime absences. Her own boss makes a play for her that ends up with Jane, her boss, her husband, and hubby's secretary all in the same night spot at the same time. Will it be divorce or reconciliation?

Cafe Metropole (1937). So early in Power's career that he isn't even top billed at this point. Power plays a young American in Paris who is in debt to a nightclub owner (Adolphe Menjou). He impersonates a Russian prince so he can woo wealthy Laura Ridgeway (Loretta Young), get his hands on her money, and repay Menjou. A good but rarely seen comedy.

Girls' Dormitory (1936) This movie is so early in Power's career that he is buried in the credits. This really isn't his film at all, but it is still above average. This is a melodrama in which a teacher in a girls' school (Herbert Marshall) is loved both by a colleague (Ruth Chatterton) and by a student (Simone Simon).

I'll Never Forget You (1951) The best film in the set, and previously entangled in a rights issue that prevented its release on DVD. If you've seen ""Somewhere in Time"" you've seen at least part of this film. Power plays a modern day scientist who wills himself back to the 18th century. He uses his modern scientific knowledge to build models of modern devices such as the steam engine in an effort to move progress forward more quickly than history did. However, in the superstitious past his inventions scare people rather than spark their creativity. He does fall in love with a girl from that century though, but loses her when reality brings him back to the present.

Love is News (1937) - A screwball comedy in which Power plays newspaper man Steve Layton who is hounding heiress Toni Gateson (Loretta Young). Toni turns the tables by announcing that she is engaged to Layton, something that is completely untrue.

That Wonderful Urge (1948) - An attempt to remake the  screwball comedy ""Love is News"" that just didn't work for me. Power did several comedies that were good, but this just wasn't one of them.

This Above All (1942) - Upper-class Englishwoman (Joan Fontaine) enlists in the WAF during WWII. She falls in love with American Clive Briggs (Tyrone Power) whom she learns is a deserter.

Second Honeymoon (1937) - Loretta Young and Tyrone Power are a divorced couple who run into each other after Young's character remarries.",1208044800,55,3564,4.6682615629984054

I'm glad Fox decided to make these available, as Tyrone Power was a great actor whose star power is underrated.  My only comment would be I wish they had not included ""Girl's Dormitory"", where he only has a few short appearances.  I thin Second Fiddle would've made a nice addtiion.

3161734,5,B0016MOWPU,"This was ordered for a friend, However many of the films I do have, just not in this set, Girls Dormitory is his first film. You only see Ty in the last part of the film. The tale is about a school girl who's in love with the head master of the school.
Cafe Metropole is with Loretta Young and Adolphe Menjjou. Forced to play a Russian  Prince due to a bet, He meets and falls in love with Young. Fast paced and funny, I loved the film.
LUCK OF THE IRISH  was filmed with a green tint when he's in a Ireland  This film was not as good as the others, but it's not bad. and I'l never forget you.  Based on the film Berkley Square, Ty goes back in time, which is then filmed in color. and must try to live s they did back then. However people see that he's not like the other people, And a women sees it but  is not afraid like the others. This film was not able to be seen for years due to legal problems.

3161735,3,B0016MOWPU,"Not a hit among them, but Ty Power's 10 flick odyssey in this collection is a lot of fun to watch - mostly. A few minor stinkers don't kill the generally appetizing aroma of this batch. You'll see 2oth Century's fox in a slew of programmers, just the sort of solid fluff that made him a star and a heartthrob. Transfer quality is fairly consistent with Luck of the Irish and I'll Never Forget You the biggest transgressors. Edge effects and some misregistration and fading of the color elements. Otherwise, enjoy this one for what it is - pure escapism. Good stuff.",1405641600,,565,4.549019607843137

3161740,5,B0016MOWPU,"Tyrone Power left this world far too soon, capping a short life but brilliant film career. As a sci-fi aficionado, I cannot resist focusing upon ""I'll Never Forget You."" The screenplay was inspired by ""Berkeley Square"", John Balderston's 1929 play. This classic (but under-appreciated) 1951 film was headlined by Tyrone Power, Michael Rennie and Ann Blyth. The updated plot involves an American nuclear scientist (Power) working in post WWII London. Power inexplicably exchanges places with his ancestor when he spontaneously time travels to 18th century London during a thunderstorm. Powers' interactions with his 18th century predecessors entail pathos, irony and humor. Stellar performances are given also by Rennie (as Power's fellow scientist and confidant) and the lovely Ann Blyth (who plays dual roles as Rennie's sister and Power's saintly 18th century love interest). The plot includes a very moving ending. This very engaging film has been out of circulation for years on TV.",1375833600,,986,5.450980392156863

Then there's one of my very favorites of his, ""Johnny Apollo."" Thanks to this set I was able to see ""This Above All"" for the first time and I agree with Jeanine Basinger that the film might've helped Ty break type if not for WWII. ""Second Honeymoon"" and ""Daytime Wife"" are pretty much fluff, but fun, too. ""The Luck of the Irish"" is a fantastical leprechaun fantasy - but entertaining - plus Anne Baxter co-starring (always a treat). Highly recommend this to all classics fans, especially those who are fans of Tyrone Power.

I am greatful that his movies will not be loss and new  generations can see films and stars of yesteryear even though they are in black in white.  This was during the Studio System where I think greatest stars shine through. I look at the films of today and rather watch any movie from the 30's or 40's then pay to movies that are produced today.  Look at the stars of the time Bette Davis,Errol Flynn, Joan Crawford, Joan Blondel, Cary  Grant.

3161751,5,B0016MOWPU,"I've discovered with many of these collections that they include some terrible films along with some good ones in the box.  And this set is no exception.  Tyrone Power is young in a lot of these movies and that is when he was his best looking.  He didn't age well after his stint in WWII (understandably so).  The film ""Girl's Dormitory"" receives a boost of energy when Tyrone Power comes upon the scene, but it is quite frankly terrible.  And a waste of time, the love story doesn't work out the way it should.  ""Cafe Metropole"" is pretty good, just when it starts to get long it ends with a very clever line.  So it redeems itself, but it is borderline.  ""Daytime Wife"" is iffy.  It ends up well, but it has male chauvinist overtones.  And it is just really a waste of time.

To me, the jewel of the set is ""Love Is News"".  There are some clever lines all throughout the film.  And the love story is a nice one.  And there is just so much energy between all the lead stars.  For this movie and this film alone, I give the set five stars.  As I really enjoyed ""Love Is News.""",1317600000,,1076,4.200980392156863

3161754,5,B0016MOWPU,"If you ever needed proof that Ty Power could really act, this is it.
Plot-wise, many of these films are B-level, but Power managed to infuse them with his brand of magic -- a catchy turn of phrase, a charming glance, a meaning-full pause.
All of these films are very watchable, and some -- such as ""Love is News"" -- show a brilliant, timeless comic flair. Power's acting makes you believe these roles could only have been written for him, and was there ever a male actor who wore historical costumes better than Ty?
This is one of the most consistently entertaining dvd collections I have ever purchased (I have watched all of them twice already).
Highly recommended for those who wish to see the charisma of a talented actor wrapped up in a physical package that is close to perfection. *sigh*

were quite dashing, romantic and versatile. Only Errol Flynn comes close.
Flynn, however, ended his career making low-quality films that were quickly
forgotten, half-completed or lost. Power stayed at the top from the beginning.
Twenty-three years of working with high-quality directors, like Billy Wilder,
John Ford and Henry King. Valentino is often mentioned as his equal. Power's
affecting charm and smoothness often left an enduring image in the minds of
his audience long after they left the theater. This box set features his

3161759,4,B0016MOWPU,"This set fills some holes in my classic movie library.  As well as giving Tyrone Power fans ten of his early films, it's also been a pleasure to increase the number of Loretta Young, Ann Blyth, Anne Baxter, Gene Tierney and Joan Fontaine titles in my collection.  It's a really fun set.  In many of his early movies, the females were the main box-office drawcard (this was especially true with the three films starring Loretta Young); although along the way the emphasis shifted to Power thanks to his handsome good looks and undeniable screen charisma.

In the Tyrone Power Matinee Idol collection, we can follow Ty's progress from supporting player to leading man.  Starting with 1936's  GIRLS' DORMITORY, a B-programmer starring Herbert Marshall and Ruth Chatterton--and Simone Simon in her American movie debut--we find Power in a small supporting role; indeed he doesn't actually appear until the final ten minutes.  The story, set in a picturesque German girls' boarding school, was I imagine quite risqu for the time.  Eighteen-year-old graduating student Marie Claudel (Simone Simon) is attracted to middle-aged head lecturer Dr. Dominick (Herbert Marshall).  Dominick is also the secret infatuation of plain-jane professor Anna (Ruth Chatterton).  Ms Simon sparkles off the screen and her scenes with Herbert Marshall are very memorable.  J. Edward Bromberg also has some great scenes playing a filthy-minded old psychology professor who is slapped silly by Chatterton in one of the best scenes.

It was his appearance in GIRLS' DORMITORY which first got Power noticed by film critics and the producers at Twentieth Century-Fox soon cast their promising young leading man in the first of several films with Loretta Young (LOVE IS NEWS) in 1937.  LOVE IS NEWS is a breezy romantic comedy starring Young as Toni Gateson, an heiress who decides to get even with Steve (Power), an overzealous reporter, by announcing she's going to marry him.  A snappy comedy in the tradition of Capra's ""It Happened One Night"".

1937 was a busy year for Young and Power, who also co-starred in two more movies that year--CAF METROPOLE and SECOND HONEYMOON.  CAF METROPOLE is a delicious screwball comedy (very Ernst Lubitsch in nature) where Power--pretending to be a Russian prince--romances sparky American heiress Young.  SECOND HONEYMOON is a cute spin on ""Private Lives"" with a plot that revolves around newly-remarried Young bumping into her former husband (Power) during a vacation with Hubby #2 (Lyle Talbot), only to discover their passion is still alive and well.  Delightful support is provided by Claire Trevor, J. Edward Bromberg and Marjorie Weaver.

Sultry brunette Linda Darnell is Ty's leading lady in 1939's DAY-TIME WIFE.  When Jane (Darnell) suspects her husband Ken (Power) of carrying on an affair with his secretary, she exacts secret revenge by applying as a secretary to one of his business partners (Warren William).  Loretta Young was originally cast as Jane before stunning nineteen-year-old Darnell came on the scene.  On the strength of their chemistry here, the two would be paired again in ""The Mark of Zorro"" in 1940.

Ty found his most dramatic role to date in the pre-noir favourite JOHNNY APOLLO in 1940, with the lovely Dorothy Lamour.  Power is the son of a Wall Street embezzler (Edward Arnold) who is forced to fend for himself when his father is sent to prison.

A stirring wartime romance, THIS ABOVE ALL (based on the book by Eric Knight) paired Power with Joan Fontaine in 1942, and was one of his final film roles before heading off for active service in the Marines.  It's always a pleasure seeing Ms Fontaine, and whilst she was often criticised in her early films for being too wooden, she delivers an exceptional performance.  Tyrone also completed ""The Black Swan"", ""Son of Fury"", and ""Crash Dive"" before his enlistment.  He returned to the screen in 1946.

It was back to romantic comedy territory in 1948's THE LUCK OF THE IRISH, a whimsical fantasy with Anne Baxter (his Oscar-winning co-star from ""The Razor's Edge"").  1948 also saw Power back in his original role for a remake of LOVE IS NEWS entitled THAT WONDERFUL URGE, this time with ""Razor's Edge"" leading lady Gene Tierney in the Loretta Young role.

Finally, in 1951's thrilling, time-traveling love story I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU, Power is seen in breathtaking Technicolor scenes which also showcase the porcelain beauty of Ann Blyth to maximum effect.  Tied up in legal and copyright battles, which prevented any possible home video or cable releases for many, many years, I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU finally makes it's long-awaited return with this box set collection.

Hopefully Fox will continue releasing these Tyrone Power boxes.  In the third volume I'd love to see ""Suez"" (the final pairing of Power and Loretta Young), ""Thin Ice"", ""Lloyd's of London"", and maybe even ""Ladies in Love"".

3161764,4,B0016MOWPU,"Tyrone Power was once quoted as saying that many of his films were a ""monument to public patience"", a telling remark hinting at the frustration which he often felt as a matinee idol rather than a highly respected actor. This DVD collection contains many examples of the former and a couple which give evidence of a talent of greater depth. The films also are a monument to the skill with which Daryl F. Zanuck promoted Power as a box office idol.

First off is 1936's ""Girl's Dormitory"", not a Power film at all but one in which his cameo role created such comment that Zanuck quickly promoted him to leads. This is one of those forgotten little films which every now and then surface and surprise. Exquisitely directed by Irving Cummings and with a superb collection of great actors including Herbert Marshall and Ruth Chatterton, the film in fact was the American debut of French actress Simone Simon who never made the impression in America she did in France. Set in a European finishing school, what first seems to be a sappy and predictable melodrama about the crush of a pupil for the head of the school becomes a touching drama with a surprising ending. The film is beautifully photographed and paced and there are some great visuals. The sets are perfect. Look for Lyn Bari among the pupils.

The next 3 films, all released in 1937, capitalised on the physical beauty of Power and paired him with his female equivalent, the radiant Loretta Young. ""Love is News"" and ""Cafe Metropole"" are lightweight romantic comedies with good supporting casts, slick direction and sometimes amusing screenplays. The former leans towards screwball, the latter towards sophisticated comedy. ""Second Honeymoon"" is easily the weakest with a slap dash script and poor direction. It looks like it was put together very cheaply. ""Cafe Metropole"" also contains 2 deleted dance sequences of Bill Robinson but you will have to watch one of the Hidden Hollywood DVDs to learn why they were deleted (racism, of course).

In 1939, 16 year old Linda Darnell landed at Fox and ""Daytime Wife"" showcases her with Power in a nasty little comedy of double standards in marriage. There is not one likeable character, including a very cheap Wendy Barrie as a secretary on the make and Binnie Barnes as an obnoxious divorcee. Darnell squeals most of her lines and Power mugs and tries to be funny but the material and the inexperienced immature Darnell do him in. Joan Davis as sleazy Warren William's receptionist gets all the good lines. This maybe the worst film in the set and one wonders why the censors allowed the screenplay to exist at all.

In 1940, Zanuck was keen to give Power a more rugged image and ""Johnny Apollo"" is a change of pace as he plays a college boy who joins the gang of underworld figure Lloyd Nolan. Dorothy Lamour, on loan out from Paramount, plays a moll and she is much more brittle than usual, spits out her lines and is riveting. Nolan always was a top actor and with the shadowy photography and an excellent plot, this is a dark and disturbing film, a pre-cursor of film noir and only let down by an unconvincing tacked on ending. Nolan's attraction to Power definitely has undertones which snuck under the censor's nose. Incidentally, Power, if as usual a little wooden, is very convincing as ivy league gone to the dogs. Finally, Edward Arnold as his father and Charles Grapewin as an alcoholic lawyer are outstanding.

By 1942, with America now involved in World War 2, all the studios produced films which cemented the link with the UK. ""This Above All"" was Fox's contribution to the epic romances which appeared at the time, films such as ""Random Harvest"" and ""The White Cliffs of Dover"". Based on a popular novel, the filmed (mis)cast Power as an English (no accent) soldier, a hero in warfare but a socialist deserter, looking for the meaning of fighting. He falls for Joan Fontaine, an aristocrat who has joined the WAAFS (very unconvincing). Fontaine is touching and carries the romance. Power gives a sincere but ""one note"" performance. His conversion from deserter is unconvincing but this was still some of his best acting to date. The film was a mammoth production and Anatole Litvak directs with feeling even if the depiction of England is artificial with the usual condescension (warm but tolerant) view of the working classes. As a depiction of England at war, the film is absurd but as propaganda submerged in romance, it is touching and effective.

The next 2 films are romantic comedies released in 1948, the sorts of films which spelt high returns at the box office but not much challenge to Power. First off is ""The Luck of the Irish"", a romantic comedy which benefits from Anne Baxter as a softly spoken lassie and Jayne Meadows as a very sophisticated New Yorker. The theme is one that was used much later in films such as ""Local Hero"", the capitalist New Yorker learning of the simpler things in life, this time from a leprechaun played by Cecil Kellaway. The whimsy is laid on pretty thick and Kellaway gives an excellent performance in an impossible role. The second film, capitalising on the success of ""The Razor's Edge"", reteamed Power with Gene Tierney in a dreary remake of ""Love is News"" called ""That Wonderful Urge"". Neither star was known for comedy technique and the film lacks the glow and energy of the earlier film. This was exactly the sort of film Power wanted to leave behind and while he doesn't quite walk through his role, he certainly lacks vitality - a  boring film and the second dud of the set.

The last film in the set is the long unseen ""I'll Never Forget You"".  In 1951, Power and Ann Blyth filmed in England a remake of ""Berkeley Square"", an enigmatic story about a scientist switching roles with his ancestor, a story of lost love and evocative of the more recent  ""Somewhere in Time"". The film is beautifully made and Power and Blyth make a convincing team, mainly due to her sensitive performance. There is an excellent British supporting cast, great sets and good colour. As in all the dramas in this set, Power makes a stolid hero.

The DVD contains some worthwhile extras. All of the films contain advertising material, production stills and in most cases the original trailer. ""The Luck of the Irish"" has an alternate tinted version, green for Ireland, which is odd to look at.  I flicked back to the black and white version very quickly.  Jayne Meadows is interviewed too and has vivid memories of the film. There are a couple of short documentaries. Loretta Young's daughter (the one whose father was Clark Gable) appears, speaking of the affection her mother held for Power. Young certainly glowed in their films together. Also Power's three children speak of their father in voice over with many images from their childhood or otherwise. Since none of them knew or remember him in person, this is more of a tribute than a personal recollection but since each seems a charming person, who cares? Lastly, there is a more detailed documentary on Power's career which certainly captures his frustration as a box office star rather than actor.

The prints of all the films are generally excellent but sometimes not perfect. For example, ""Love is News"" shows signs of wear but the clean bright look which characterised so many Fox films dominates the end result so it doesn't really matter. The set is good value even if the comedies are mainly weak.",1222905600,3,7412,4.766952455183165

There are 5 discs in the boxed set:

DISC 1:
""Girls Dormitory"" (1936): In less than 3 minutes on-screen, in a minor role, the astonishingly handsome Power 'steals' this melodrama! A rather tame love triangle between middle-aged, bachelor professor Herbert Marshall, his devoted co-worker (Ruth Chatterton), and a barely-legal nymphet (Simone Simon, in her American debut), becomes every 'dirty old man's' fantasy, with it's off-kilter resolution...2 stars (out of 5)

Special Feature: Brief look at Power's life and acting career...

""Caf&eacute; Metropole"" (1937): Delightful sophisticated comedy that marked Power and Loretta Young's third teaming. Penniless Power must repay a debt to Parisian club owner Adolph Menjou by pretending to be a Russian count, to fleece heiress Young. Sly and funny, this screwball tale is silly without losing it's charm... 4 1/2 stars (out of 5)

Special Feature: Two deleted Dance Sequences featuring Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson...

DISC 2:
Two versions of the same story, each starring Power...
""Love is News"" (1937): Glib, muck-raking reporter Power is given a taste of his own medicine when heiress Loretta Young falsely announces they are engaged. In their second of five films together, both seem too young and 'nice' for their roles, but the comedy benefits immensely from Don Ameche's energized 'take' as Power's boss, and grand support by George Sanders and Slim Summerville. Great fun! 3 1/2 stars (out of five)

Special Feature: A look at Power and Young's five films, with recollections by Young's daughter (by Clark Gable)...

""That Wonderful Urge"" (1948): Padded remake of ""News"" offers Power, at 34, more believable as the opportunistic reporter, but his co-star, Gene Tierney, lacks Young's warmth and compassion. This time around, the heiress fibs they are married, but even with more comic opportunities, the film lacks sparkle (although Chill Wills does a nice turn in the Summerville role)...2 1/2 stars (out of five)

DISC 3:
""This Above All"" (1942): Dunkirk survivor/deserter Power finds redemption in the love of WAAF Joan Fontaine, and the kindness of the British people who befriend him as he eludes the authorities. While Power's American accent is incongruous in the leading role, he is very sincere, and Fontaine is terrific, with excellent support from Thomas Mitchell and Nigel Bruce. A British flag-waving drama, to be sure, but still moving...4 stars (out of five)

""Second Honeymoon"" (1937): Power and Young's fourth teaming, in a dated, silly comedy, of ex-husband Power attempting to win Young away from her boorish current spouse (Lyle Talbott). Typical 30s stereotypes (idle rich leading carefree, globe-trotting lives, alcohol abuse as funny, rather than a problem), redeemed, somewhat, by the stars' chemistry. Stuart Erwin sparkles as Power's bookish valet, and there is a cute in-joke about Power's resemblance to British star Ronald Colman (who had, in fact, co-starred with Young in three films). 2 1/2 stars (out of five)

DISC 4:
""Day-Time Wife"" (1939): Lightweight fluff of suspicious wife Linda Darnell (at just 16!), taking on a secretarial job with Warren William to discover why hubby Power might be cheating with his secretary. Dumb premise, but William, an old hand at playing lecherous bosses, lifts the film above average... 2 1/2 stars (out of five)

Special Feature: Power's three children reminisce about their dad...

""Johnny Apollo"" (1940): Noirish melodrama of Power turning to a life of crime to pay off his embezzler father's debts. Power is surprisingly good in the darker role, as are Edward Arnold as his father, and Lloyd Nolan, as Power's racketeer mentor. Dorothy Lamour (fresh from ""Road to Singapore"") makes a very sexy leading lady for Ty! 4 1/2 stars (out of five)

DISC 5:
""The Luck of the Irish"" (1948): Comic fantasy of traveling journalist Power befriending a sly leprechaun (Cecil Kellaway), and a saucy innkeeper (Anne Baxter), while in Ireland, and being granted good luck that leads his ambitions awry. Sweet-natured, with able support by Lee J. Cobb and Jayne Meadows, but the film cries out to be actually filmed in Ireland, and in Technicolor, rather than just with green-tinted Irish sequences. 3 1/2 stars (out of five)

Special Feature: Jayne Meadows' memories of Tyrone Power...

""I'll Never Forget You"" (1951): The much-anticipated return of the magical romantic fantasy, as modern-day nuclear physicist Power is struck by lightning, and dropped into the body of his ancestor, in Technicolor-hued 1784 London. He finds unexpected love with Ann Blyth (in one of her best roles), but is soon declared insane from his knowledge of the future! With the wonderful Michael Rennie in support, the film suffers from a dated atomic-testing sequence, and washed-out colors in the 1784 sequences, but the plot is still terrific, and would inspire 1980's ""Somewhere in Time""... 5 stars (out of five)

Special Feature: Ann Blyth's photos while in London...

3396193,5,B0016MOWPU,"Tyrone Power made 52 movies, and appeared in a wide variety of radio and stage work. He died tragically in his mid-40s and at the height of his career, his haunted, almost too pretty looks, all but hiding a formidable talent. While this new collection only hints at the strength and genius to come in such films as Nightmare Alley, The Sun Also Rises and Witness for the Prosecution, these earlier films are also a fair example of the middle-of-the-road Fox releases before and after the Second World War---popular, carefully constructed illustrations of mass entertainment and escapism.
The collection contains 10 films Power made between 1938-1951 as a Fox contract player, and his steady rise to film stardom is more than apparent here. Each film suggests a decided growth in Power's talent, from supporting player in Girls Dormitory to Loretta Young's love interest in three fluffy comedies---Love is News, Cafe Metropole and Second Honeymoon. Following his success with the proto-noir Johnny Apollo, he landed This Above All, an epic wartime romance then Daytime Wife, a flick that teams Power with Linda Darnell, who's stunningly beautiful in her first leading role. In Luck of the Irish, a whimsical leprechaun played by Cecil Kellaway, helps Power woo Anne Baxter. In That Wonderful Urge, Power joins Gene Tierney for romance, and finally, he teams with Ann Blyth for the multi-period costume drama I'll Never Forget You. Power died of a heart attack in 1958, and few performers today could even think of eclipsing---or even equaling---his style, good looks or talent.",1217116800,20,1576,5.136186770428016
3396194,5,B0016MOWPU,"Tyrone Power died on November 15, 1958.  In 2007, 20th Century Fox released a five-disk set of Power's swashbuckler films and was overwhelmed by its success - so overwhelmed, in fact, that a year later, they are following it up with 10 more films, the majority of which are from Power's early days at the studio where he spent about 17 years of his 22-year career.

In addition, Power's anniversary is due to be celebrated at the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles in November, with tributes at the Film Society of Lincoln Center and in his home town of Cincinnati to follow.  It's probably not enough for a tremendous star who doesn't benefit from Turner Classic Movies network or books because TCM doesn't own his films, and it's definitely not enough for this highly underrated actor whose breathtaking looks received most of the reviews.

This second collection, the ""Matinee Idol"" collection consists of Girls Dormitory, in which he has a small role but received most adulation on the preview cards.  It's said that Hedda Hopper sat through the film twice to make sure she had his name right.  Next is Love is News, a wonderful film showing Power's ability at comedy; Cafe Metropole, a delicious Lubitsch-like comedy; Second Honeymoon, a ""Private Lives"" takeoff about the beautiful people - Love is News, Cafe Metropole and Second Honeymoon all co-star Loretta Young; Daytime Wife, costarring a very young Linda Darnell, a rather flimsy comedy also starring Warren William (this light film is said to be Power's punishment for defying the studio and marrying his first wife, Annabella). Gangster drama Johnny Apollo rounds out the '40s, Power costarring with the lovely Dorothy Lamour.

This Above All was based on the best-seller by Eric Knight, and although all the hot sex was removed from the film, it still holds up as a war drama and wonderful acting vehicle for Power and Joan Fontaine.  Jeanine Basinger, author of ""The Star Machine"" feels this film could have helped Power turn a corner into more dramatic acting had not World War II intervened.  Post-war, a remake of Love is News with Gene Tierney, That Wonderful Urge; Luck of the Irish, a sprightly comedy popular around St. Pat's Day, and I'll Never Forget You, which hasn't been seen in decades due to legal problems.  It has been one of the most requested films to be put on DVD for several years.

Features include a career retrospective, a scene cut from Cafe Metropole, Judy Lewis talking about her mother Loretta Young's relationship with Tyrone Power, and a film narrated by two of Power's children.

Discontented with Hollywood, Power went on to distinguish himself in theater in London and on Broadway.  He made some of his best films away from 20th Century Fox, particularly Witness for the Prosecution, Abandon Ship, The Eddy Duchin Story and The Long Gray Line. Today, Tyrone Power is still one of the top 100 box office stars of all time, a list that includes stars up to the present time, such as Depp, DeCaprio, and Clooney. It is estimated that Power's films grossed $1 billion during decades when films cost a nickel, a dime, a quarter and at the time of his death, an average price of $.68. That's a lot of people - and a lot of popcorn.  He remains today in the top 100 all time box office stars according to Quigley, and that includes modern-day stars such as DiCaprio and Depp.",1209168000,116,3364,4.787564766839378
3396195,5,B0016MOWPU,"Last year's volume one of Tyrone Power movies did very well, and Fox is giving us another box set of Power's films as a result. This contains some of Power's less remembered films and is completely absent the swashbuckling roles that dominated the first set.

Luck of the Irish (1948) American Steven Fitzgerald is visiting Ireland when he meets a beautiful Irish girl. However, Steven is ambitious and he has a chance to marry the boss' daughter back in America with all of the priveleges such a union would entail. What will he do?

Johnny Apollo (1940) In the title role Power is the son of a man who is embarrassingly guilty of stealing from his corporation's shareholders. With his father in prison and the money all gone, Power's character is also labeled as untrustworthy because of his father's behavior, and thus he cannot find a job. He takes up with gangsters and eventually ends up in prison next to dad. Will he turn his life around or attempt escape?

Day-Time Wife (1939) Power plays Ken Norton and Linda Darnell plays his wife Jane. Jane finds out that Ken is stepping out with his secretary. Jane is determined to find out what these men see in their secretaries and takes a job as one herself, always making excuses for her daytime absences. Her own boss makes a play for her that ends up with Jane, her boss, her husband, and hubby's secretary all in the same night spot at the same time. Will it be divorce or reconciliation?

Cafe Metropole (1937). So early in Power's career that he isn't even top billed at this point. Power plays a young American in Paris who is in debt to a nightclub owner (Adolphe Menjou). He impersonates a Russian prince so he can woo wealthy Laura Ridgeway (Loretta Young), get his hands on her money, and repay Menjou. A good but rarely seen comedy.

Girls' Dormitory (1936) This movie is so early in Power's career that he is buried in the credits. This really isn't his film at all, but it is still above average. This is a melodrama in which a teacher in a girls' school (Herbert Marshall) is loved both by a colleague (Ruth Chatterton) and by a student (Simone Simon).

I'll Never Forget You (1951) The best film in the set, and previously entangled in a rights issue that prevented its release on DVD. If you've seen ""Somewhere in Time"" you've seen at least part of this film. Power plays a modern day scientist who wills himself back to the 18th century. He uses his modern scientific knowledge to build models of modern devices such as the steam engine in an effort to move progress forward more quickly than history did. However, in the superstitious past his inventions scare people rather than spark their creativity. He does fall in love with a girl from that century though, but loses her when reality brings him back to the present.

Love is News (1937) - A screwball comedy in which Power plays newspaper man Steve Layton who is hounding heiress Toni Gateson (Loretta Young). Toni turns the tables by announcing that she is engaged to Layton, something that is completely untrue.

That Wonderful Urge (1948) - An attempt to remake the  screwball comedy ""Love is News"" that just didn't work for me. Power did several comedies that were good, but this just wasn't one of them.

This Above All (1942) - Upper-class Englishwoman (Joan Fontaine) enlists in the WAF during WWII. She falls in love with American Clive Briggs (Tyrone Power) whom she learns is a deserter.

Second Honeymoon (1937) - Loretta Young and Tyrone Power are a divorced couple who run into each other after Young's character remarries.",1208044800,55,3564,4.6682615629984054

3396237,5,B0016MOWPU,"Tyrone Power left this world far too soon, capping a short life but brilliant film career. As a sci-fi aficionado, I cannot resist focusing upon ""I'll Never Forget You."" The screenplay was inspired by ""Berkeley Square"", John Balderston's 1929 play. This classic (but under-appreciated) 1951 film was headlined by Tyrone Power, Michael Rennie and Ann Blyth. The updated plot involves an American nuclear scientist (Power) working in post WWII London. Power inexplicably exchanges places with his ancestor when he spontaneously time travels to 18th century London during a thunderstorm. Powers' interactions with his 18th century predecessors entail pathos, irony and humor. Stellar performances are given also by Rennie (as Power's fellow scientist and confidant) and the lovely Ann Blyth (who plays dual roles as Rennie's sister and Power's saintly 18th century love interest). The plot includes a very moving ending. This very engaging film has been out of circulation for years on TV.",1375833600,,986,5.450980392156863

Thanks to this set I was able to see ""This Above All"" for the first time and I agree with Jeanine Basinger that the film might've helped Ty break type if not for WWII. ""Second Honeymoon"" and ""Daytime Wife"" are pretty much fluff, but fun, too. ""The Luck of the Irish"" is a fantastical leprechaun fantasy - but entertaining - plus Anne Baxter co-starring (always a treat). Highly recommend this to all classics fans, especially those who are fans of Tyrone Power.

This was during the Studio System where I think greatest stars shine through. I look at the films of today and rather watch any movie from the 30's or 40's then pay to movies that are produced today.  Look at the stars of the time Bette Davis,Errol Flynn, Joan Crawford, Joan Blondel, Cary  Grant.

3396248,5,B0016MOWPU,"I've discovered with many of these collections that they include some terrible films along with some good ones in the box.  And this set is no exception.  Tyrone Power is young in a lot of these movies and that is when he was his best looking.  He didn't age well after his stint in WWII (understandably so).  The film ""Girl's Dormitory"" receives a boost of energy when Tyrone Power comes upon the scene, but it is quite frankly terrible.  And a waste of time, the love story doesn't work out the way it should.  ""Cafe Metropole"" is pretty good, just when it starts to get long it ends with a very clever line.  So it redeems itself, but it is borderline.  ""Daytime Wife"" is iffy.  It ends up well, but it has male chauvinist overtones.  And it is just really a waste of time.

To me, the jewel of the set is ""Love Is News"".  There are some clever lines all throughout the film.  And the love story is a nice one.  And there is just so much energy between all the lead stars.  For this movie and this film alone, I give the set five stars.  As I really enjoyed ""Love Is News.""",1317600000,,1076,4.200980392156863

3396251,5,B0016MOWPU,"If you ever needed proof that Ty Power could really act, this is it.
Plot-wise, many of these films are B-level, but Power managed to infuse them with his brand of magic -- a catchy turn of phrase, a charming glance, a meaning-full pause.
All of these films are very watchable, and some -- such as ""Love is News"" -- show a brilliant, timeless comic flair. Power's acting makes you believe these roles could only have been written for him, and was there ever a male actor who wore historical costumes better than Ty?
This is one of the most consistently entertaining dvd collections I have ever purchased (I have watched all of them twice already).
Highly recommended for those who wish to see the charisma of a talented actor wrapped up in a physical package that is close to perfection. *sigh*

were quite dashing, romantic and versatile. Only Errol Flynn comes close.

Twenty-three years of working with high-quality directors, like Billy Wilder,
John Ford and Henry King. Valentino is often mentioned as his equal. Power's
affecting charm and smoothness often left an enduring image in the minds of

3396256,4,B0016MOWPU,"This set fills some holes in my classic movie library.  As well as giving Tyrone Power fans ten of his early films, it's also been a pleasure to increase the number of Loretta Young, Ann Blyth, Anne Baxter, Gene Tierney and Joan Fontaine titles in my collection.  It's a really fun set.  In many of his early movies, the females were the main box-office drawcard (this was especially true with the three films starring Loretta Young); although along the way the emphasis shifted to Power thanks to his handsome good looks and undeniable screen charisma.

In the Tyrone Power Matinee Idol collection, we can follow Ty's progress from supporting player to leading man.  Starting with 1936's  GIRLS' DORMITORY, a B-programmer starring Herbert Marshall and Ruth Chatterton--and Simone Simon in her American movie debut--we find Power in a small supporting role; indeed he doesn't actually appear until the final ten minutes.  The story, set in a picturesque German girls' boarding school, was I imagine quite risqu for the time.  Eighteen-year-old graduating student Marie Claudel (Simone Simon) is attracted to middle-aged head lecturer Dr. Dominick (Herbert Marshall).  Dominick is also the secret infatuation of plain-jane professor Anna (Ruth Chatterton).  Ms Simon sparkles off the screen and her scenes with Herbert Marshall are very memorable.  J. Edward Bromberg also has some great scenes playing a filthy-minded old psychology professor who is slapped silly by Chatterton in one of the best scenes.

It was his appearance in GIRLS' DORMITORY which first got Power noticed by film critics and the producers at Twentieth Century-Fox soon cast their promising young leading man in the first of several films with Loretta Young (LOVE IS NEWS) in 1937.  LOVE IS NEWS is a breezy romantic comedy starring Young as Toni Gateson, an heiress who decides to get even with Steve (Power), an overzealous reporter, by announcing she's going to marry him.  A snappy comedy in the tradition of Capra's ""It Happened One Night"".

1937 was a busy year for Young and Power, who also co-starred in two more movies that year--CAF METROPOLE and SECOND HONEYMOON.  CAF METROPOLE is a delicious screwball comedy (very Ernst Lubitsch in nature) where Power--pretending to be a Russian prince--romances sparky American heiress Young.  SECOND HONEYMOON is a cute spin on ""Private Lives"" with a plot that revolves around newly-remarried Young bumping into her former husband (Power) during a vacation with Hubby #2 (Lyle Talbot), only to discover their passion is still alive and well.  Delightful support is provided by Claire Trevor, J. Edward Bromberg and Marjorie Weaver.

Sultry brunette Linda Darnell is Ty's leading lady in 1939's DAY-TIME WIFE.  When Jane (Darnell) suspects her husband Ken (Power) of carrying on an affair with his secretary, she exacts secret revenge by applying as a secretary to one of his business partners (Warren William).  Loretta Young was originally cast as Jane before stunning nineteen-year-old Darnell came on the scene.  On the strength of their chemistry here, the two would be paired again in ""The Mark of Zorro"" in 1940.

Ty found his most dramatic role to date in the pre-noir favourite JOHNNY APOLLO in 1940, with the lovely Dorothy Lamour.  Power is the son of a Wall Street embezzler (Edward Arnold) who is forced to fend for himself when his father is sent to prison.

A stirring wartime romance, THIS ABOVE ALL (based on the book by Eric Knight) paired Power with Joan Fontaine in 1942, and was one of his final film roles before heading off for active service in the Marines.  It's always a pleasure seeing Ms Fontaine, and whilst she was often criticised in her early films for being too wooden, she delivers an exceptional performance.  Tyrone also completed ""The Black Swan"", ""Son of Fury"", and ""Crash Dive"" before his enlistment.  He returned to the screen in 1946.

It was back to romantic comedy territory in 1948's THE LUCK OF THE IRISH, a whimsical fantasy with Anne Baxter (his Oscar-winning co-star from ""The Razor's Edge"").  1948 also saw Power back in his original role for a remake of LOVE IS NEWS entitled THAT WONDERFUL URGE, this time with ""Razor's Edge"" leading lady Gene Tierney in the Loretta Young role.

Finally, in 1951's thrilling, time-traveling love story I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU, Power is seen in breathtaking Technicolor scenes which also showcase the porcelain beauty of Ann Blyth to maximum effect.  Tied up in legal and copyright battles, which prevented any possible home video or cable releases for many, many years, I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU finally makes it's long-awaited return with this box set collection.

Hopefully Fox will continue releasing these Tyrone Power boxes.  In the third volume I'd love to see ""Suez"" (the final pairing of Power and Loretta Young), ""Thin Ice"", ""Lloyd's of London"", and maybe even ""Ladies in Love"".

3396261,4,B0016MOWPU,"Tyrone Power was once quoted as saying that many of his films were a ""monument to public patience"", a telling remark hinting at the frustration which he often felt as a matinee idol rather than a highly respected actor. This DVD collection contains many examples of the former and a couple which give evidence of a talent of greater depth. The films also are a monument to the skill with which Daryl F. Zanuck promoted Power as a box office idol.

First off is 1936's ""Girl's Dormitory"", not a Power film at all but one in which his cameo role created such comment that Zanuck quickly promoted him to leads. This is one of those forgotten little films which every now and then surface and surprise. Exquisitely directed by Irving Cummings and with a superb collection of great actors including Herbert Marshall and Ruth Chatterton, the film in fact was the American debut of French actress Simone Simon who never made the impression in America she did in France. Set in a European finishing school, what first seems to be a sappy and predictable melodrama about the crush of a pupil for the head of the school becomes a touching drama with a surprising ending. The film is beautifully photographed and paced and there are some great visuals. The sets are perfect. Look for Lyn Bari among the pupils.

The next 3 films, all released in 1937, capitalised on the physical beauty of Power and paired him with his female equivalent, the radiant Loretta Young. ""Love is News"" and ""Cafe Metropole"" are lightweight romantic comedies with good supporting casts, slick direction and sometimes amusing screenplays. The former leans towards screwball, the latter towards sophisticated comedy. ""Second Honeymoon"" is easily the weakest with a slap dash script and poor direction. It looks like it was put together very cheaply. ""Cafe Metropole"" also contains 2 deleted dance sequences of Bill Robinson but you will have to watch one of the Hidden Hollywood DVDs to learn why they were deleted (racism, of course).

In 1939, 16 year old Linda Darnell landed at Fox and ""Daytime Wife"" showcases her with Power in a nasty little comedy of double standards in marriage. There is not one likeable character, including a very cheap Wendy Barrie as a secretary on the make and Binnie Barnes as an obnoxious divorcee. Darnell squeals most of her lines and Power mugs and tries to be funny but the material and the inexperienced immature Darnell do him in. Joan Davis as sleazy Warren William's receptionist gets all the good lines. This maybe the worst film in the set and one wonders why the censors allowed the screenplay to exist at all.

In 1940, Zanuck was keen to give Power a more rugged image and ""Johnny Apollo"" is a change of pace as he plays a college boy who joins the gang of underworld figure Lloyd Nolan. Dorothy Lamour, on loan out from Paramount, plays a moll and she is much more brittle than usual, spits out her lines and is riveting. Nolan always was a top actor and with the shadowy photography and an excellent plot, this is a dark and disturbing film, a pre-cursor of film noir and only let down by an unconvincing tacked on ending. Nolan's attraction to Power definitely has undertones which snuck under the censor's nose. Incidentally, Power, if as usual a little wooden, is very convincing as ivy league gone to the dogs. Finally, Edward Arnold as his father and Charles Grapewin as an alcoholic lawyer are outstanding.

By 1942, with America now involved in World War 2, all the studios produced films which cemented the link with the UK. ""This Above All"" was Fox's contribution to the epic romances which appeared at the time, films such as ""Random Harvest"" and ""The White Cliffs of Dover"". Based on a popular novel, the filmed (mis)cast Power as an English (no accent) soldier, a hero in warfare but a socialist deserter, looking for the meaning of fighting. He falls for Joan Fontaine, an aristocrat who has joined the WAAFS (very unconvincing). Fontaine is touching and carries the romance. Power gives a sincere but ""one note"" performance. His conversion from deserter is unconvincing but this was still some of his best acting to date. The film was a mammoth production and Anatole Litvak directs with feeling even if the depiction of England is artificial with the usual condescension (warm but tolerant) view of the working classes. As a depiction of England at war, the film is absurd but as propaganda submerged in romance, it is touching and effective.

The next 2 films are romantic comedies released in 1948, the sorts of films which spelt high returns at the box office but not much challenge to Power. First off is ""The Luck of the Irish"", a romantic comedy which benefits from Anne Baxter as a softly spoken lassie and Jayne Meadows as a very sophisticated New Yorker. The theme is one that was used much later in films such as ""Local Hero"", the capitalist New Yorker learning of the simpler things in life, this time from a leprechaun played by Cecil Kellaway. The whimsy is laid on pretty thick and Kellaway gives an excellent performance in an impossible role. The second film, capitalising on the success of ""The Razor's Edge"", reteamed Power with Gene Tierney in a dreary remake of ""Love is News"" called ""That Wonderful Urge"". Neither star was known for comedy technique and the film lacks the glow and energy of the earlier film. This was exactly the sort of film Power wanted to leave behind and while he doesn't quite walk through his role, he certainly lacks vitality - a  boring film and the second dud of the set.

The last film in the set is the long unseen ""I'll Never Forget You"".  In 1951, Power and Ann Blyth filmed in England a remake of ""Berkeley Square"", an enigmatic story about a scientist switching roles with his ancestor, a story of lost love and evocative of the more recent  ""Somewhere in Time"". The film is beautifully made and Power and Blyth make a convincing team, mainly due to her sensitive performance. There is an excellent British supporting cast, great sets and good colour. As in all the dramas in this set, Power makes a stolid hero.

The DVD contains some worthwhile extras. All of the films contain advertising material, production stills and in most cases the original trailer. ""The Luck of the Irish"" has an alternate tinted version, green for Ireland, which is odd to look at.  I flicked back to the black and white version very quickly.  Jayne Meadows is interviewed too and has vivid memories of the film. There are a couple of short documentaries. Loretta Young's daughter (the one whose father was Clark Gable) appears, speaking of the affection her mother held for Power. Young certainly glowed in their films together. Also Power's three children speak of their father in voice over with many images from their childhood or otherwise. Since none of them knew or remember him in person, this is more of a tribute than a personal recollection but since each seems a charming person, who cares? Lastly, there is a more detailed documentary on Power's career which certainly captures his frustration as a box office star rather than actor.

The prints of all the films are generally excellent but sometimes not perfect. For example, ""Love is News"" shows signs of wear but the clean bright look which characterised so many Fox films dominates the end result so it doesn't really matter. The set is good value even if the comedies are mainly weak.",1222905600,3,7412,4.766952455183165
3396262,5,B0016MOWPU,"Tyrone Power was from a reknown acting family. This collection focuses on movies not often showed on tv. Girl's Dormitory was merely a walk-on at the end of the picture but it was enough to catch the interest of the female preview audiences and set Power on his way as becoming the top male star of 20th Century Fox Studio. Both Johnny Apollo and This Above All showcase Power's acting abilities that were often not used by his studio. These films have great supporting actors, such as Loretta Young, Linda Darnell, Dorothy Lamour and Joan Fontaine. This is  must for any Power fan.",1221523200,4,582,4.650485436893204
3396263,4,B0016MOWPU,"I really appreciate this box with the loveliest Tyrone Power.  The comedies are charming and amusing, and Tyrone is so handsome.  For fans only.",1221091200,3,144,4.958333333333333
3396264,3,B0016MOWPU,"C'est du vieil Hollywood, des comdies qui ont trs mal vieillies. Les femmes sont belles mais les intrigues sont insignifiantes. Ou bien il s'agit d'un couple mari, et ils se disputeront durant une heure avant de se rconcilier  la fin, ou bien ils ne sont pas encore maris et ils le seront  la fin du film, aprs bien des quiproquos sans intrt.
C'est laborieux, c'est trs ""bourgeois"" et si l'on voque l'adultre, on ne franchit jamais le pas. Quant au sexe, il n'existe pas.
Reste le charme de Tyrone Power, ses beaux cheveux noirs, son beau sourire, sa prestance physique. C'est bien peu vis--vis de scnarios indigents et tous plus prvisibles les uns que les autres.",1220140800,4,664,4.7155172413793105
3396265,4,B0016MOWPU,"""Tyrone Power Matinee Idol Collection"" may lack the opulence of the first Power (""Swashbuckler"") collection, but it does offer the legendary star at his most handsome, as well as one of his most 'in demand' titles, ""I'll Never Forget You"", a generation after it's last television screening...which makes the collection a must!

There are 5 discs in the boxed set:

DISC 1:
""Girls Dormitory"" (1936): In less than 3 minutes on-screen, in a minor role, the astonishingly handsome Power 'steals' this melodrama! A rather tame love triangle between middle-aged, bachelor professor Herbert Marshall, his devoted co-worker (Ruth Chatterton), and a barely-legal nymphet (Simone Simon, in her American debut), becomes every 'dirty old man's' fantasy, with it's off-kilter resolution...2 stars (out of 5)

Special Feature: Brief look at Power's life and acting career...

""Caf&eacute; Metropole"" (1937): Delightful sophisticated comedy that marked Power and Loretta Young's third teaming. Penniless Power must repay a debt to Parisian club owner Adolph Menjou by pretending to be a Russian count, to fleece heiress Young. Sly and funny, this screwball tale is silly without losing it's charm... 4 1/2 stars (out of 5)

Special Feature: Two deleted Dance Sequences featuring Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson...

DISC 2:
Two versions of the same story, each starring Power...
""Love is News"" (1937): Glib, muck-raking reporter Power is given a taste of his own medicine when heiress Loretta Young falsely announces they are engaged. In their second of five films together, both seem too young and 'nice' for their roles, but the comedy benefits immensely from Don Ameche's energized 'take' as Power's boss, and grand support by George Sanders and Slim Summerville. Great fun! 3 1/2 stars (out of five)

Special Feature: A look at Power and Young's five films, with recollections by Young's daughter (by Clark Gable)...

""That Wonderful Urge"" (1948): Padded remake of ""News"" offers Power, at 34, more believable as the opportunistic reporter, but his co-star, Gene Tierney, lacks Young's warmth and compassion. This time around, the heiress fibs they are married, but even with more comic opportunities, the film lacks sparkle (although Chill Wills does a nice turn in the Summerville role)...2 1/2 stars (out of five)

DISC 3:
""This Above All"" (1942): Dunkirk survivor/deserter Power finds redemption in the love of WAAF Joan Fontaine, and the kindness of the British people who befriend him as he eludes the authorities. While Power's American accent is incongruous in the leading role, he is very sincere, and Fontaine is terrific, with excellent support from Thomas Mitchell and Nigel Bruce. A British flag-waving drama, to be sure, but still moving...4 stars (out of five)

""Second Honeymoon"" (1937): Power and Young's fourth teaming, in a dated, silly comedy, of ex-husband Power attempting to win Young away from her boorish current spouse (Lyle Talbott). Typical 30s stereotypes (idle rich leading carefree, globe-trotting lives, alcohol abuse as funny, rather than a problem), redeemed, somewhat, by the stars' chemistry. Stuart Erwin sparkles as Power's bookish valet, and there is a cute in-joke about Power's resemblance to British star Ronald Colman (who had, in fact, co-starred with Young in three films). 2 1/2 stars (out of five)

DISC 4:
""Day-Time Wife"" (1939): Lightweight fluff of suspicious wife Linda Darnell (at just 16!), taking on a secretarial job with Warren William to discover why hubby Power might be cheating with his secretary. Dumb premise, but William, an old hand at playing lecherous bosses, lifts the film above average... 2 1/2 stars (out of five)

Special Feature: Power's three children reminisce about their dad...

""Johnny Apollo"" (1940): Noirish melodrama of Power turning to a life of crime to pay off his embezzler father's debts. Power is surprisingly good in the darker role, as are Edward Arnold as his father, and Lloyd Nolan, as Power's racketeer mentor. Dorothy Lamour (fresh from ""Road to Singapore"") makes a very sexy leading lady for Ty! 4 1/2 stars (out of five)

DISC 5:
""The Luck of the Irish"" (1948): Comic fantasy of traveling journalist Power befriending a sly leprechaun (Cecil Kellaway), and a saucy innkeeper (Anne Baxter), while in Ireland, and being granted good luck that leads his ambitions awry. Sweet-natured, with able support by Lee J. Cobb and Jayne Meadows, but the film cries out to be actually filmed in Ireland, and in Technicolor, rather than just with green-tinted Irish sequences. 3 1/2 stars (out of five)

Special Feature: Jayne Meadows' memories of Tyrone Power...

""I'll Never Forget You"" (1951): The much-anticipated return of the magical romantic fantasy, as modern-day nuclear physicist Power is struck by lightning, and dropped into the body of his ancestor, in Technicolor-hued 1784 London. He finds unexpected love with Ann Blyth (in one of her best roles), but is soon declared insane from his knowledge of the future! With the wonderful Michael Rennie in support, the film suffers from a dated atomic-testing sequence, and washed-out colors in the 1784 sequences, but the plot is still terrific, and would inspire 1980's ""Somewhere in Time""... 5 stars (out of five)

Special Feature: Ann Blyth's photos while in London...
