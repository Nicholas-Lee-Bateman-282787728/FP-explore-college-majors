Hasselhoff look alike, David Heavener delivers some classic lines on his way to becoming a Gen Z anti-hero by punching out a beserk baby zombie in the hysterical and over the top ""Baby Fritter"" scene. Who cares what PETA or the PTA have to say ! The Heaven-Man is on a mission to save California from rampaging zombies and .... A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do !

Todd Bridges ( Willis on ""Different Strokes"")is also on board as is Martin Sheenan's brother, Joe Estevez .... But the real clincher is in the Epilogue ..... which delivers one of the best and most un-PC lines in decades .......I had to watch this 3 times and went "" Whoah !!!!! Did my ears just hear what I thought I heard!"" .....This Zombie Zinger moment will be whispered in solemn hommage on campuses across the land and could become a late night rally cry around the world !!!!

2916770,1,B000U65G0I,"If a weak premise and poor acting weren't enough to kill this movie, go ahead and throw in bucketfuls of 3rd-grade level cinematography, heaping tablespoons of cheesy special effects and sloppy choppy editing and you've got the recipe for this disaster of a movie.  Dawn of the Living Dead (Also known as Curse of the Maya) is the sort of mess that would barely get a passing grade in a high school film class.

It's not even of one of those ""so cheesy it's fun"" pics. This is the sort of movie that would have made Ed Wood cringe.  Do yourself a favor and find something better to do with 90 minutes of your life.  Skip this movie!",1186790400,3,632,4.330508474576271
2916771,4,B000U65G0I,"I have to say that the scene with the zombie baby attacking David Heavener is so absurdly funny that we cut it into a loop for repeat playback.  What makes it work is the goofy effects on the zombie baby, which looks like a ""Chatty Cathy"" doll from 1968, with fangs, blood and goo slathered about to make it look creepy.  If you're expecting a demon baby ala ""It's Alive"" then you won't appreciate the camp of this low-budget zombie fest.  Most of the time, micro-budget horror films fail on all fronts.  But for ""Dawn of the Living Dead,"" Heavener scores for intentional and unintentional wackiness that probably was not scripted.  Great companion piece for ""Shaun of the Dead"".

2916774,2,B000U65G0I,"The premise of the movie might have been interesting with better writing, acting, and directing. The special effects are okay, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. The ending was just terrible and made no sense at all.",1200096000,4,230,4.5
2916775,1,B000U65G0I,"First, there is no ""army"" of the dead. There is only one Hispanic family who becomes zombies after being murdrered.
Second, Todd Bridges only has a small role as a retarded man with fake buck-teeth and a ""pillow"" or balloon under his shirt to make him look chubby. This is by far the worst and the silliest and the most misleading zombie movie that I have ever seen. Buy this at your own risk. Of course, I rate this movie with one star.
Maybe there is a worse zombie movie, but, I can't imagine any film being that much worse than this waste of time and money for the movie buyer and the producers of this nonesense.
Bad special effects along with a korny script make this actually painful to watch. I believe this horror movie is even worse than ""The Church""!
I thought that movie was the worst horror ever made-I was sadly mistaken",1199664000,10,834,4.387096774193548

It's a bromide that you have to watch to the end to comprehend this gem, but you have to watch to the end.

2916780,4,B000U65G0I,"Heavener fans are an obscure but important sub-culture.  Heavener is great because he takes actors we all know and casts them in the most bizarre movies.

In DotLD, he goes for Todd Bridges and Emilio Estevez, and it is way over the top in typical Heavener fashion. Consume mass quantities and watch late at night.

8212146,1,B000U65G0I,"Dawn of the Living Dead (David Heavener, 2004)

NOTE: the following review (well, the first paragraph) contains a major spoiler for this movie. Be warned.

Is there anything more satisfying in low-budget horror these days than watching Joe Estevez die horribly? And the best part is, it's so easy to find. Per IMDB, Mr. Estevez (who, in case the look and the voice didn't tip you off, is Martin Sheen's brother, Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez' uncle) appeared in sixteen movies in 2010 alone. Without actually investigating, I'd say, simply judging by the titles, a little over half of those are horror movies. I'd further say, given my recent experiences with flicks in which Joe Estevez appears, he probably died (and horribly) in three-quarters of those. I mean, you can't really go wrong with a Joe Estevez movie, as long as you're only looking for ""Joe Estevez Bites It. Horribly."". If you're looking for a good movie, on the other hand, you're almost certainly better off looking elsewhere. Estevez, over the past quarter-century, has made some choices that would have been career-killers for just about anyone else. Soultaker. Sigma Die!. Legend of the Roller Blade Seven. (And a sequel!) Zombie Farm. I Got the Hook-Up (which I think actually did kill a number of careers). Dawn of the Living Dead, which was originally titled Evil Grave: Curse of the Maya. Subsequently retitled, one assumes, to appeal to the Romero-loving crowd.

Plot: A former mental patient, Renee (Things You Don't Tell's Amanda Bauman), and her doctor, Jeffrey (Estevez), with whom she has fallen hopelessly in love, move out to the middle of the Arizona desert, presumably to continue her recovery. While wandering through the desert one afternoon, she comes upon Michael (martial artist Heavener), a caretaker for the surrounding windmills, and his mentally-challenged assistant Herardo (Todd Bridges... yes, that Todd Bridges). Since they seem to be the only people within hundreds of miles, Renee invites Michael back to the house for dinner, where he tells them that the house (which Jeffrey got on ebay, sight unseen) was the site of the recent murder of a family of illegal immigrants; immigrants, it seems, had been using it as a safe-house for some time. The dead are restless, and Renee finds that she must figure out who the killer is before they devour everyone in sight.

David Heavener's acting is... indescribable. Suffice to say that in the scenes they have together, he makes Joe Estevez (by far the best actor in this joint) look good. As Joe was never, shall we say, blessed with the talent of the rest of the family, that takes some doing. And then there is Bridges, who seems to have taken every emotion from the ""I'm a mess"" years and channelled them into this character, about whom nothing politically correct can be said (he is, in the classical sense of the phrase, a low-functioning moron). There are actors who have made careers out of effectively playing the mentally challenged, Billy Bob Thornton (Sling Blade) and Leonardo di Caprio (What's Eating Gilbert Grape?) being two modern examples. Todd Bridges will never gain that kind of recognition based on this performance. And, as Captain Peacock was won't to say, ""thank heaven for that"".

Heavener's IMDB page notes that, in addition to being a martial artist, he also composes and performs Christian music (whether contemporary or gospel is not specified). Judging by this movie, at least, he should abandon the film career and take up music full-time. It can't be any worse than this. A much better take on this same basic idea, though with ghosts instead of zombies, was released the same year, called <em>Kucuk Kiyamet</em>, in Turkey. Much harder to find in America, I'm sure, but a much, much more rewarding film than this. (half)",1307664000,3,3802,4.971698113207547

The wallet vampires who gave this more than 2 stars are definitely them.  Not the worst I've seen, but this one will define ""bad script,"" as well as demonstrate superbly deceptive packaging, very nicely for you.  It claims to be as funny as it is frightening.  Well, it's not very frightening, but it's never funny.  Bad, but not Ed Wood bad.  If you tell me where the marketing people can be found, I'll meet you there with the pitchforks and torches.

Don't let the title fool you. It has no connection with the Romero films apart from it has changed it's name from Curse of the Maya to try to cash in on Romero's great films. THIS IS NOT DAWN OF THE DEAD.
