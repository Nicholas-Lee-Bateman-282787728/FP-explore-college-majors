8496892,5,B006EP28KK,"It is a great series. I loved it. I was not too happy with Maja Ostaszewska as Wanda, too weepy and unbelievable, but the story is great. Characters well developed, a little bit annoying music while showing the love story moments, but not too obtrusive. The Jewish plot is incredible. I thought that actors who played Lena's parents were great. Really, a great story.",1475539200,,367,4.75
8496893,5,B006EP28KK,"I bought this from the amazon UK site but it is so good, I wanted to put a post on both the USA and UK sites.  This show is fantastic. It is well acted, fast pasted and has excellent subtitles for people like me who don't speak Polish.  I watched season 1 in a weekend, season 2 another weekend and now onto Season 3.
If you are interested in WWII history, buy this series, you won't be disappointed.",1409443200,3,400,4.115384615384615
