188489,5,1572521333,"I thought Leslie Nielsen's Stupid Little Golf Video looked questionable when I first saw it.  But, the truth is, this video turned out to be one of  the funniest things I've ever seen or heard.  When Nielsen played the  ""scratch golfer"" it turned to be hilarious when he got behind the  wheel of the golf cart.  His instructions of what to do when you miss the  golf ball entirely(It would be a practice shot) were really really funny.  It just shows that you can be funny with stupid jokes and obviously a  really low budget.  I watched it and plan on buying it.",966211200,3,563,4.378640776699029

7797448,5,1572521333,"Didn't expect too much out of this one, but it's Leslie Nielsen and he's just funny standing. However, this was very funny! This is based on his book ""Stupid Little Golf Book"", and he goes from start to finish step-by-step on how to be the best worst golfer ever. His examples of how to annoy your opponent are excellent (I may incorporate some myself). Only about 50 minutes of ha-lariousness!",1359331200,,394,4.642857142857143
7797449,3,1572521333,"I love golf and I love Leslie Nielsen.  However, the writers for this one, with rare exception, seem not to love either.  (I did not miss that Mr. Nielson himself was one of the writers...but he must have been practicing that great swing he has when the final script was prepared.)  And Leslie, if you read this, I want you to know that I remember you as the Swamp Fox in the early days of Disney TV, love what you have done with your career, and ""surely"" wish you continued personal and professional success.",1162771200,2,509,4.3936170212765955
7797450,3,1572521333,"I didn't expect much out of this when I purchased it. I really only got it 'cause I like the campy humour of Nielson. This little 50 minute golf video filmed at that Canadian Castle hotel place is not the funniest thing i've ever seen before, but it had a few good laughs as Leslie teaches you how to be a bad golfer. He gives you bizzare tips on how to hit, dice, slice and how to beat those overconfident players. As well as some bizzare tips you will look funny at the screen from and think, ""WTF?""

It's in 2.0, runs for 50 minutes also has a biogrphay of Nielsn on it and some other thing to read that I skipped.

IMO it should be a bonus feature on something else, but heck, for the price, it's ok on it's own for now I guess. It's ok, its not rip-roaring funny, but you should find a few laughs in it.",1151107200,,808,4.012422360248447
7797451,4,1572521333,"This movie was really funny, although it may have been poorly written, it was still funny and helpfull. This video teaches you the basics of golf, and how to throw your partner out of the cart and how to totally irritate him. This dvd can help with your golf playing. I think that you will like this dvd very much, unless you are dumb and have no scents of humor.
I think Leslie shood stick to naked gun movies and ones like that. There is also a pretty good one, other than this one with leslie on golf.",1069200000,3,504,4.153061224489796
7797452,4,1572521333,"Many people forget that Mr. Neilsen started off with serious roles in the 60s and 70s then went for a change and starred in Spaceship, a hard-to-find, campy classic filmed right after Airplane.
Also knows as Naked Space and The Creature Wasn't Nice, this video is probably only found in dark alley video stores, where THIS golf video should be...
Too bad Spaceship (aka, aka) can't be more readily available,
 like on Amazon.com",1009929600,3,428,4.863013698630137
7797453,1,1572521333,I could probably make you laugh harder by filming myself urinating on Leslie Nielson.,989712000,7,85,5.142857142857143
7797454,1,1572521333,"I'm an avid golfer, and a big fan of Leslie Nielsen, and love silly humor.  I thought this would be a classic.  It's not.  It's a low-budget loser, poorly written, poorly produced, and poorly acted.  Take a pass.",982022400,11,212,4.5
7797455,5,1572521333,i never thought that i would consider this movie one of the greatest I have ever seen. this movie didn't seem like much while i was watching it  but there is no movie that has kept me laughing longer than this one. Every  time I think of this retarded movie it cracks me up even more than before.  I give it an A++++,966470400,3,316,3.984126984126984
