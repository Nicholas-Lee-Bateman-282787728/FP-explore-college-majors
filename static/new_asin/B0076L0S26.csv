I don't have that video, but in this one the amount seems fine. I lived in LA once and attended a class -  I think some teachers are more hands on than others.  Mark touched everybody, including me, but it wasn't weird - just normal adjustments to help you do the poses right. He is even nicer in person; there is a lot of laughter in his classes and everybody feels comfortable.  He was very respectful & considerate to me.",1527724800,,565,4.261682242990654
8510985,4,B0076L0S26,"I have the set of 3 Progressive Power Yoga dvds and have done all of them many times.  I like them all, but I like #3 the best.  It is LONG, about 90 minutes.  My body feels tired and invigorated after this workout.  Nothing in this video is hard to do for those who have practiced yoga for awhile.  The posed require an intermediate level of strength, balance and stamina.  If you are a first time beginner this will be very challenging and probably not the best choice.",1373673600,2,471,4.295454545454546
