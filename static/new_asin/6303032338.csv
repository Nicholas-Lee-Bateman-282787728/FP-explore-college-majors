557960,4,6303032338,"this is a fab film. the music is just one excellent bit. the bizarre bingo scene stuff is, to be fair, best left in the polar regions- but despite the  setting, this is a warming and positive film which tackles some complex and  interesting issues on its way through. it is much more than a showcase for  k.d.- although she does, obviously, shine in a film that was written for  her.  the lighting and the setting, the story and the twists, the music and  getting to watch k.d. maked in a library (don't ask- watch it? ) are  elements of a splendid whole. okay, so it is a bit dated now, and not  everyone wants to engage with lead characters howling in radar dish. but i  think that it's worth the watching: saw it for the first time many years  ago and can still remember clearly crucial and powerful parts. buy it- even  if it's the only way to get your hands on what i think is the best song  that kd has ever done.",966988800,11,919,4.188571428571429
557961,5,6303032338,"Salmonberries provides a view of a life that few  of us will experience, in the polar region, on the edge of wilderness. People there know intense weather, and often great lonliness.  The film deals with this lonliness,  and its expression in song.  A wonderful haunting piece sung by K.D. Lang,  who also gives a fine acting performance.",955756800,11,338,4.859649122807017
557962,4,6303032338,I love this movie!  My favorite part is when they cross all that snow in the snowmobile and the theme song goes on and on.  I can't find that song anywhere and I wish I could because it's so haunting and it's stayed with  me ever since.,916876800,4,236,3.978723404255319

558083,2,6303032338,"I loved Percy Adlon's Baghdad Cafe and have watched it several times, always happily: it is eccentric, kindly, and optimistic.  Salmonberries is a less happy production, though it deals with a similar theme and an Alaskan equivalent setting.  The script and acting are awkward.  Oscar Kawagley, in his few minutes on screen, is the only sympathetic character.  The persistent German fascination with First Nations culture --- as usual over the top --- called for a pretty unflattering self portrayal by the Innu cast --- who in this movie are called ""Eskimos"".",1326153600,,560,5.1208791208791204
558084,4,6303032338,"A sort of mix of Percy Adlon's earlier `Bagdad Caf' and
Roberty Altman's  `Three Women' set in Alaska.

k.d. lang plays an androgynous miner who falls in love with a straight, private, local German librarian.
They both have muddy, tragic pasts that slowly emerge.  There are some deeply moving moments,
and some wonderful slightly magical realist touches.  The cinematography is very good. But while lang
does a surprisingly decent job, I can't help thinking a stronger, more experienced actress could have
brought out even more in this amazing role.

That said, I did enjoy this much more on a second viewing.  While it bothered me that it felt at times like
Adlon was simply trying to re-create the magic of `Bagdad Caf' (odd, surreal setting, quirky out of place
characters, cinematography that uses color in exaggerated ways for effect, etc.) overall I found
myself more able to just let go and accept this tale on its own merits.  And doing that, it made me smile.",1289606400,2,969,4.836363636363636

558086,5,6303032338,"This, at age 71 is my first-ever purchase of a lesbian-themed DVD and I find myself in awe and respect. Though markedly removed from my own personal sphere of gay male existence, ""SALMONBERRIES"" is nevertheless worthy of everyone's wondrous appreciation and thoughtful consideration. Thank you kd lang for the haunting melodies found here in abundance in both music and storyline. There is a rich vein of gold to be found in ""SALMONBERRIES"" if one has tender patience and a motivating desire to learn.",1266969600,,501,5.048192771084337
558087,5,6303032338,"I am absolutely embarrassed for all the k.d. fans who gave this film a bad review!  Shame on you!  Before you purchase this film, you need to understand that this is not your typical Hollywood big-screen movie with a straighforward love story and a happy end.  This is an independent picture with a rather complex storyline that not many of us can relate to.  Salmonberries is written about a different side of the world, about people with broken hopes and lives, about the human ability to understand one another even in the most bizarre of circumstances.  This film is so painfully deep and so unaccustomely romantic that is takes your breath away - of course, you have to be a real connoisseur of complex vision and of independent film.

As far as k.d.'s performance goes, it is flawless, impeccable!  She so masterfully slipped into Kotzebu's skin and has delivered the character in the most natural and graceful way.  I cannot imagine another actress play this role better than k.d.!  Despite the fact that she's a truly gifted singer, she is also an amazing actress!  I strongly believe that k.d. deserves our biggest compliments and applause for this performance.  I take my hat off to her!

Salmonberries is a truly entrancing film, accompanied by k.d.'s amazing Barefoot, and it is quite an experience!",1251676800,8,1311,4.8558558558558556
558088,1,6303032338,"Don't bother.  This movie is just plain bad and not even worth watching for the scenery (Alaska or K.D. Lang).  It is not even a lesbian movie.  There is no romance at all.  As someone who lives in Alaska, I can tell you this movie is not realistic nor would these people survive here.  It feels like it was made by someone from Florida.  Also, a plot would be nice.",1180310400,,366,4.1571428571428575
558089,5,6303032338,"Those of you who find the plot  vague ( I guess mostly Americans raised in plush conditions), put your imagination to work!:

Think about more realistic and sophisticated Jungle Book. A neglected girl not exposed to(and avoiding psychological pollution by) common concepts of femininity and stereotypic roles of women (she didn't accept the Eskimo version from her foster family because she felt she was different). She was  practically raised by Nature in its most brutal form - she was forced spent her childhood on mastering the skill of survival and finally something (perhaps long idle breaks from work)triggered her search for self-identity and exploration of humanity.

K D Lang was a perfect, natural fit for the character (or perhaps she herself inspired the whole story.",1163894400,6,780,5.216
558156,1,6303032338,"It's a real stinker of a movie. It's touted as a love story but it starts as a stalking story to me. No motive why k.d. fell in love with the librarian who was harsh and cold to her for half the movie or more. And at the beginning, k.d. came across close to a feral animal and at best in the movie, a lovesick overgrown tomboy. I don't know which was worse, the writing or the editing. The woman playing the librarian (Rosel Zech) was the only redeeming factor in the movie. I picked it because I love hearing k.d. sing but she sure didn't impress me with her acting.

Stay away from the Salmonberries, it will make you ill.",1153958400,3,624,4.1570247933884295

558158,2,6303032338,"I don't consider this a lesbian film at all.  There was little chemistry between the two characters.  There were many confusing hallucinatory scenes which were simply added.  The scenery was beautiful and KD's song (grossly overplayed over and over) is beautiful as well.  But honestly, if that's all you can say is this had great scenery, a beautiful theme song and a good acting job by KD...that alone does not make a movie good.

She is NOT some stupid label made up artist like Britney! Hello, wake up people, how stupid can you be. Britney versus k.d. lang? LOL! Whatever with your posters! You have no musical taste...period!

This is a love story.  This is the story of acceptance.  The characters are deeply rooted and complex.  I own the VHS version, and recently bought the DVD.  I recommend purchasing the DVD because the quality is far superior, and there is additional bonus footage.  Lang is interviewed by Percy Adlon as they watch clips of the movie together in her home.  She presents her take on the complex character she played, and on her co-star.  If you're looking for a movie that will touch your heart, both in pain and in joy, I recommend buying this DVD.",1017273600,13,711,4.624

I had never heard of k.d. lang before, but I was so impressed by her performance and her voice that I have become a k.d. devotee since then.  The raw emotion combined with the purity of her voice are a combination that is not only hard to beat but IMPOSSIBLE to beat!  The empathy and understanding of the emotions of the characters is unsurpassed and k.d. and Rosel excel in their roles.  This is not just a movie for or about lesbians...This is a movie about people, Real People.  This movie is so intensly emotional and so sensual that you had better be able to have your full attention on Salmonberries or you will miss sharing a wonderful experience.",1013990400,4,711,4.396946564885496

I wish I could find this song on a cd - BUT the price of the movie is NOT worth it just for the song.  Okay, yeah, you _also_ get a naked kd in the library.  STILL not worth it.
