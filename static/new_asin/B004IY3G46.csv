8431364,5,B004IY3G46,"I am fascinated with snakes and reptiles of all types.  I shared this video with my grandsons, 8 and 13, and they were amazed at how much snake venom helps mankind.  They were especially intrigued by the people in the video and how they came to do what they do with reptiles.  Very well done; informative and educational.",1325635200,,321,4.5
8431365,3,B004IY3G46,"We are often used to animals using size or speed to kill prey and others.  However, many animals are too small for that, so they use poison.

This doc had creepy-crawly critters, postmodern computer graphics, and scenes of violence.  It almost reminded me of that poetry line ""snakes and snails and puppy dog tails.""  The work showed several female scientists, but there's something guy-ish, Spike Channel-y about this.

This taught me a lot I didn't know.  The narrator stated that 100,000 humans die from poison each year.  Jellyfish don't have brains.  Some snails can throw poisonous harpoons from their bodies.

Like many docs, this work kinda pats the researchers on the back who are studying this topic.  More importantly, the unknown is emphasized.  The work said there may be 2 million venoms out there and we only know about 2, 000.

The work tries to keep it positive.  It said venom can kill, but they are learning about how it can heal.  They suggest that some venoms may help prevent or reduce diabetes, stroke, heart attacks, inter alia.  There is a green message here.  They note that if we learn how these animals' poisons can save humans, then maybe humans will do more to make sure that species stay alive and that biodiversity gets maintained.",1305763200,,1263,4.804651162790698
