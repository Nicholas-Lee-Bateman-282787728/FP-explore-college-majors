4187714,2,B003S6T5UY,"The reviews and description did not accurately describe this collection. I like old horror movies and I really like ""B"" Horror movies. But these aren't even Good Old ""B"" Horror Movies.

I am sure there are some that will enjoy these, but this is nothing what I thought I was getting. The cool and modern cover had me fooled.",1294704000,5,324,4.491525423728813
4187715,3,B003S6T5UY,"This collection is just what they describe... Midnight Classics.
The good old days of overacting and crazy ideas that were a risk back in the 60's.  If you like the old movies, this is a great purchase.  Break out the popcorn and soda. Turn out the lights and if there's a knock at the door, don't answer it... you could be next! The kids will get a kick out of this collection also.",1294272000,13,383,4.232876712328767

8404049,1,B003S6T5UY,"If these films were ultra rare and absolutely important to own then maybe I would have given this collection another half star but this collection is bad in every sense of the word. The quality of the transfers is bad. Third generation VHS type of copies burned onto a dvd that are painful to try and watch. The idea that one or any of these film were ""widescreen"" is suspect to me. I'm guessing that the film in question was cropped to make it look widescreen. I'm glad I only paid 2 bucks for this at a second hand shop because it isn't even worth that much.",1421107200,,560,4.242990654205608

8404054,5,B003S6T5UY,"This is a review for the POP FLIX VAMPIRE WEREWOLF DARK MOON collection. The dvd states that THE DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE is in widescreen, which IT IS! It's VERY HARD to come across this movie in widescreen without paying BIG$$$ for the out-of-print REDEMPTION copies. And the transfer here is EXCELLENT! Crisp, clear with great color. A true sleeper of a bargain. Watch this one on a double bill with VAMPIRE'S NIGHT ORGY. Pretty much the same plot...busload of travelers stranded only to die one by one in some remote European locale.
Don't choke here, but ALPHA has a really good dvd of VAMPIRE'S NIGHT ORGY, an excellent letterboxed transfer!
So buy both instead of a bus ticket to some unknown region in Europe that could be your last ride to sheer Hell.",1376006400,4,753,4.712121212121212
