The techniques and stances that you thought you wouldn't forget become fuzzy, and this DVD is very useful to have so that you can practice the form correctly and not have to re-learn it when your errors come to light in class.  It also provides more than one camera angle so you can see the techniques all the way through the form.",1287619200,2,424,4.2875
7982167,5,B00008E2N1,Don't hesitate. If you need a great reference for review or just learning this DVD is the one to own.  You can skip to the sections you are interested in very easily.,1186790400,3,166,4.1875
