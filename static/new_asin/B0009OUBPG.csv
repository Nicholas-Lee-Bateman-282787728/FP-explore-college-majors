8064585,3,B0009OUBPG,I can't rate this one yet because I gave it for a gift. I just ordered me another copy for myself this time.,1467763200,,108,3.739130434782609
8064586,4,B0009OUBPG,One of those shows you watch again to catch what you missed the first time.,1419465600,,75,4.066666666666666
8064587,5,B0009OUBPG,"unreal is one of the coolest movies i've seen in a while. i don't want to give anything away but it says so much about people and relationships and hooking up, and is so funny, with a really hot cast. i've already watched it a ton of times and all my friends love it too. i bought 3 copies for my friends for christmas. i don't understand how you can't love this movie.",1136505600,,369,4.068493150684931
8064588,2,B0009OUBPG,"Unreal is a bad movie. It starts out good, but gets really boring. Then you realize it's a mockumentary and the whole film goes down hill.",1131321600,,138,4.346153846153846
8064589,4,B0009OUBPG,I saw Unreal just after I broke up with my long-term boyfriend and I loved it.  I could identify with the characters and what they were going through.  The movie was funny and sweet at the same time.  I loved how they bashed reality shows in the process.  A must see for anyone who has ever battled the single scene!,1127692800,2,316,4.216666666666667
8064590,5,B0009OUBPG,"unREAL - as ironically literal as a title could be - is the type of film with such absolutely relate-able truth that it is the perfect movie to watch when getting through a breakup, or for anytime in a relationship or single life for that matter. It truly has something for everyone, whether you're the sensitive romantic type, or edgier player type. This movie captures the best and worst parts of every aspect of relationships. With that, it even has a twist in the story while poking fun at reality tv. UNREAL has quickly moved into my favs with REALITY BITES, SINGLES, and SWINGERS. It couldn't be more of a perfect breakup therapy!",1124668800,,636,4.6371681415929205
8064591,4,B0009OUBPG,"Anyone can relate to this movie and what the characters are going through. You can see where the other side is coming from and you can immediately relate to your side. It is funny, hearwarming and real. You can't go wrong!",1124409600,2,222,4.439024390243903
8064592,4,B0009OUBPG,"Same style as the new show ""Hooking Up""  but better.  See if you can determine the ending!  I bet you can't!  Fun Movie!",1124150400,2,120,4.086956521739131
