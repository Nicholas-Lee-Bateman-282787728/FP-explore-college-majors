8372460,5,B002L6HASG,"This film contains amazing historical footage of the EBT prior to the tourist days.  In addition, the ""modern"" footage in the film can now be considered historic as well.  There are great clips of film from a large chunk of the line and spanning several years of operation.  While the footage is great, the film overall is somewhat lacking in information and detail.  The quick summary of the entire film is: ""historic eye candy for any EBT fan"" but not much more.  While there isn't a lot in the way of substance or history in the film, the footage alone makes it worth the price.",1350000000,2,581,4.495238095238095
