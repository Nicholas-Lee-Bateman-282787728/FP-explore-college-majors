8713420,4,B00WH9SXQA,"I was fortunate to see/hear them on this tour in NJ three weeks prior to this recording.  Little did I know they would splinter shortly after this; and then the recent loss of John Wetton, not to be together again.  As others have noted; In this day, with a relatively recent recording, why no surround sound?",1486944000,,309,4.5
8713421,5,B00WH9SXQA,great show with the original band back together.,1448409600,,48,5.125
8713422,5,B00WH9SXQA,Enjoyed the show!  Saw them in 82 as my first concert ever.  You could melt bricks with how loud it was.  Great show now too...,1446854400,,127,4.0
8713423,5,B00WH9SXQA,"Absolutely fantastic.  Sharp video and good, crisp audio.  This is a must-have for any Asia fan, especially given that it appears it's the last live recording with Steve Howe as a member.  The selections from XXX are superbly rendered.",1440201600,,235,4.9743589743589745
8713424,4,B00WH9SXQA,"Very well performed concert, they sound in a very good shape. A must have for Asia followers. In relation to the purchase itself, it is very common that the plastic box arrives damaged. Amazon should improve the packages.",1437868800,,221,4.842105263157895
8713425,5,B00WH9SXQA,Steve Howe's last tour with the band to date!  Nice show four suberb musicians.  New material holds up pretty well.  Hard to top the songs from the first album.  just sit back and enjoy,1437609600,,185,4.352941176470588
8713426,3,B00WH9SXQA,"This is the review of the video and not the audio. I had to watch this to know that if you want to buy
this other live album, you don't really need the video. Frontier Records has released many live
albums of Asia in the past tours. A band that had a long career despite the inconsistency of their
music. Some that don't like this music will say that this Pop, AOR kind of music has never been
interesting. But i am sure at the time the band released their first album, the progressive rock
community was intrigued to know what quality of music can play those great musicians. At the time,
it was a deception, because Progressive Rocks fans were use to hear Progressive Rock music. After
some line-up changes, it was worst, not only it was not more Progressive, but the songs were not as
good as their first album. But, i think the band has made some better songs in the late 90's and
enough good songs in their last albums to make a decent set list on this new live album.

I said that the video portion was not needed to appreciate this live recording, because of the lack
of visuals. The picture and the sound are ok, and for those musicians that seemed  operating on
automatic pilot, you won't hear many mistakes. As you might expect, this is not a essential album
for your collection.",1435968000,4,1289,4.366666666666666
8713427,5,B00WH9SXQA,"Have all of Asia's (the original line up) live concerts on DVD/Blu-Ray. Some are better than others.

Fantasia - Live In Tokyo - 2007
Spirit Of The Night - Cambridge - 2009
Resonance - 2010
High Voltage - 2010
Axis Live - San Francisco - 2012

Just bought and watched Axis live Blu-Ray. I had the original broadcast and can happily report they have remixed the audio and sounds fantastic.
Some previous releases have had a bit of a shoddy sound mix. High Voltage for one. For Fantasia, always felt Palmers drums were a bit back in the mix. Just a personal opinion.

For the Axis Blu-Ray, this has the band in perfect picture quality and great audio. Arguably the best audio mix of any release. The bass is nice and deep and Palmers drums have been well turned up louder than before. Watching this really brought a smile to my face.

Great track listing and a magical full on electric version, of the rare B-Side, Ride Easy.
We also have an extended version of The Smile Has Left Your Eyes, which starts off acoustic and finishes in a large bombastic full on band.
One of my personal favourites.

Can really recommend this to all Asia fans. A shame Howe left in 2012.
Hope to look forward to a Gravitas Tour Blu-Ray though.",1435190400,10,1222,4.461883408071749
