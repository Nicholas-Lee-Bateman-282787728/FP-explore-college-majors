2774115,1,B000NOK1NO,Still the same Directors cut version. Its also the 4:3 pan and scan box version. The added scene where they are crossing the bridge after the garage present day battle where Connors girl gives him the flowers etc is on here. Its so corny. The Directors cut ruined the original version which flowed better and had better editing. They didn't need to add all the unnecessary scenes.,1477785600,,380,4.686567164179104
