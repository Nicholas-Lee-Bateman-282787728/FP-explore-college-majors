8297805,2,B001ED3JFK,"The film is in such poor shape, the transfer is inconsistent at best (splotches one minute, too dark or too light the next).  That, in itself, is not enough to spoil a good movie.  This isn't a good movie.  So that settles that.
The plot is more plodding than plot: you have your standard bad guys and typical good guys.  The bad guys always seem to have the upper hand, which is odd considering there's only 4 of them and a village filled with people.  But that's usually the way things go in these types of movies.  It was all about the treasure anyway.
The acting is a mixed bag of incompetent (Felix Locher) to those who have been better but didn't seem to care what impression they left on the viewers this time (Mike Mazurki).  At least Peter Lorre did the best he could with the brief role he was given.  The only one who stood out was John Carradine; he threw himself into the role with such relish one has to wonder why all the effort except that he was a pro and obviously didn't view this as a comedown.  There are no small roles, only small actors.  Everyone else just looked tired or inexperienced.  Not that there was much of a story to emote for; greed has been done better (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre for one).
Just a time waster and only about an hour at that (although it seemed like a whole lot longer at the time!).
Not a keeper.",1299801600,4,1355,4.25390625
