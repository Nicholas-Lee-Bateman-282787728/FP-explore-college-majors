4493092,5,B004X9YNNO,"A fascinating and powerful departure for Almodovar, or perhaps more
accurately more an terrific hybrid of the best of his old and new.

This has the darker, more actively perversely disturbing and violent themes
of some of his early work like 'Matador' but shot and directed with the
far smoother and more mature hand he has developed over the years. It
also continues the more complex and fractured time structure approach of
Almodovar's more recent work, to great effect.

In the end it's a gorgeous looking, philosophically complex mystery and
horror film. Although not particularly gory, this is a disturbing work, both on a
literal story level, and also for the questions it raises about
identity, love, sado-masochism, and passion run amok.

These themes are all Almodovar touchstones, but delivered here with a
visually stunning icy touch, and with much more complete logic than in
his early works, which often felt less fully thought through, and had
more frustrating plot holes and character leaps.

Not a 'scary' film, but a creepy, moody and highly effective one. A
dark fairy tale as told by, say Stanley Kubrick.

It's good to see Antonio Banderas reunited with Almodovar, and he
delivers a wonderfully complex and quirky modern day Dr. Frankenstein.

Less emotional than my two very favorite Almodovar films (Talk to Her,
All About My Mother), but its exciting to see this extremely talented
film maker continue to evolve and grow, and I think this represents
work that can stand among his best.",1321920000,7,1509,5.016
4493093,5,B004X9YNNO,"Certainly Pedro Almodovar is like no other movie maker on earth. I swear that you can pick his films out of a movie lineup. There is usually the sexual overlay, sometimes more obvious than at other times. Some of the women characters look as if they may not have been born women. On the other hand, some of the women are frightening beautiful (Elena Anaya as Vera is this film). And even in Almodor's most serious films, there is an element of comedy. (As in this movie, only a mother can identify her masked son by seeing his naked butt!)

We can all rejoice to see that Antonio Banderas, whom I believe Almodovar may have discovered, is aging well. His understated ice-cold portrayal of a scientist set on revenge-- which is always best if rendered up cold-- is quite wonderful.

Unfortunately, ""The Skin I Live In"" is one of those movies that you cannot describe in detail or you will do a tremendous disservice to anyone wanting to see it. If you like Senor Almodovar, however, or if you want to see a film not like anything else you'll see this year, then you should quietly slip into your local theatre. You are in for both a visual treat and a plot that will keep you wide awake!",1321574400,6,1186,4.435779816513762
4493094,4,B004X9YNNO,"I had caught wind of The Skin I Live In a few months back. I remember watching a trailer and/or reading a brief description of the project and being incredibly interested in seeing it. Then the film had a positive reputation amongst well-known critics and review sites, so that pretty much sealed my interest in it right there. The downside was I had never seen a Pedro Almod&oacute;var film and I really don't care for Antonio Banderas outside of like Desperado, but still the desire to see this film was there. Nothing can really prepare you for The Skin I Live In though. You'll pretty much be left gobsmacked with your jaw on the floor on at least one occasion during the film.

Robert Ledgard (Banderas) is a plastic surgeon who has just developed artificial skin from pig cells that's stronger than the average person's skin, is heat resistant, and insect resistant. Brilliant research has lead to a brilliant discovery. Robert has many skeletons buried in his closet though. The main one being a woman named Vera (Elena Anaya) being kept captive by Robert who has been the test subject to his experiments. With the loss of his family, Robert has jumped headfirst into his research to distract himself from his demons for so long that he's basically forgotten how to think clearly; a decision that'll come back to haunt him sooner rather than later.

It is extremely difficult to give you much of an idea of what this film allows you to see without spoiling what's absolutely vital to enjoying (or at least being caught off guard) by the climax of the film. There are a few obvious things that come to mind though. The first one being that the score is fantastic and easily one of the best of the year. Full orchestra scores or ones that utilize a heavy use of pianos, violins, and or cellos always speak to me in volumes. The other thing is that Antonio Banderas seems to be stepping way out of his comfort zone for this film and I mean that in a positive way. Outside of a handful of films like Desperado, The Mask of Zorro, and The 13th Warrior, Banderas seems to be known for Spanish films, romantic comedies, and children's films (the Spy Kids & Shrek films). Once you see The Skin I Live In, your reaction is basically something along the lines of, ""Holy ....! That was this guy? Where the hell did this come from?"" It's kind of spectacular in this awe-inspiring kind of way. While there is certainly an art to actors who make a name for themselves as well-known character actors, I've always preferred the talented individuals who take on a variety of different and unexpected projects. Showing a wide variety of your talent is way more impressive than showing people the same thing you do well over and over again. Lastly, if you're a fan of films with twists or movies that offer something you weren't expecting going in then The Skin I Live In is worth looking into. It's a really unique twist on the revenge genre.

The Skin I Live In obviously won't be for everyone. Some will find it ridiculous while others will speak volumes of it long after they should. Its nonlinear storytelling certainly strengthens the impact of a key scene while simultaneously making you contemplate just where in the world the film could go from there. Even if you don't enjoy it, you can probably at least agree that it's one of the most unpredictable films of the year. With all of this said, there are a few downers to the film. For one, the sex scenes are incredibly awkward; the subtext of the film being the key reason for that. The ending also suits the film well on one hand, but is kind of weak on the other. It feels a little too open-ended for a possible sequel opportunity, but also feels like a gratifying finale to this particular part of the story. The Skin I Live In is a dark, beautifully disturbing, shocking thriller that doesn't adhere to predictability.",1320364800,2,3870,4.589595375722543
4493095,5,B004X9YNNO,"First off, in no way do I condone the actions in the film. By them-selves and in real life, they are beyond despicable.

However, this is film noir - mixed with Spanish melodrama - mixed with psychological and physical thriller - mixed with an elegant painting - mixed with a powerful statement.

There was The Crying Game, there was Boxing Helena (directed by Lynch's daughter).
No film has been created like this one...

The Skin I Live In uses melodrama to distance the audience from the deep horrors within the story. Horrors that are so elegantly painted by Almod&oacute;var that a viewer feels, like they are in a virtual macabre painting.
While one can not agree with the violence shown, the beauty of the film-making, the risk, the lack of boundaries, the eye-acting, the colours, schemes, pallets, dimensions, depths, panics, laughs, pain and horror are masked with unbelievably beautiful film-making.

I am stunned and mesmerized by the editing, the 2012/2006 half and halves, the circular nature of the story, the shock of what actually occurs.
Surely for a bible-study class, this would be a sinful picture. Perhaps a Devil's Film.
But Art is meant to peek into the psyche, to expose that which lurks. It can be done in a brazen class-less way (i.e. horror/torture film) or in a spotless, clean and brisk moving art piece.

How many rapes, mutilated women and messed-up versions of transsexuality can Almodovar cram into one bad movie? Almost two hours' worth. Self-indulgent, sexist, transphobic. Yuck. Yuck. YUCK. Icky and offensive to transgender and cisgender women alike, Almodovar's  misogyny has never been so much in the foreground. Or so unmistakable. There's no complexity, just exploitation wrapped up in pretentious allusions (Titian, Franju, Alice Munro...why Alice Munro?!). And really, his use of rape as ""plot device"" and his sympathy for rapists isn't ""shocking"" or ""transgressive."" Another film in which every woman is either a mother or a victim or both.

4493140,4,B004X9YNNO,"Pedro Almodvars 18th film The Skin I Live In (2011, La piel que habito) is by some distance quite the coldest film he has ever made. It is certainly admirable that a great director seeks to boldly change direction every now and then and Almodvar has done it remarkably well twice before  with The Law of Desire (1987), the first of his sophisticated El Deseo films which broke with the wild transgressions of all his films prior to that; and with The Flower of My Secret (1995) which heralded a new satisfyingly weighty seriousness which marks the films now considered to be his greatest works, Live Flesh (1997), All About My Mother (1999), Talk to Her (2002), Bad Education (2004) and Volver (2006). Broken Embraces (2009) is less successful and perhaps signaled to the director the need for another new direction. He has acknowledged a nose-dive into darkness since the turn of the millennium and it is only the passionate investment of his own autobiographical obsessions and pre-occupations that glues the various shards of his always elaborate screenplays together to make satisfying wholes. That glue is completely missing from Broken Embraces and (given it is meant to be a romantic melodrama) is fatal in its effect. The glue is also absent from The Skin I Live In, but because it largely jettisons autobiography in favor of sci-fi psycho-horror the damage isn't as great even if the effect is still cold and deadening. The film is not exciting enough, shocking enough, violent enough, or suspense-filled enough to satisfy as psycho-horror. It is also way too cerebral and clinical to satisfy as melodrama. A pastiche of different styles and genres, in one way it does absolutely feel like an Almodvar film, but the frenetic plotting knitting together elements of Eyes Without a Face (1960, Georges Franju) with Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956, Don Siegel) and Rebecca (1940, Hitchcock) with Metropolis (1926, Fritz Lang) negates character empathy and finally leaves us chilled rather than touched. The film certainly is beautifully made and admirers of both Almodvar and Antonio Banderas (making his return to the director after 20 years) will find ample compensations here. The following contains spoilers. The film relies heavily on a surprise twist so if you haven't seen the film yet DO NOT read what follows.

Taken from Thierry Jonquets novel Tarantula, The Skin I Live In is only the second of Almodvars adaptations of someone elses material (the first was his take on Ruth Rendells Live Flesh) and apparently had a decade-long gestation period. This dates the original conception to around 9/11 and as in much art made since then perhaps the dark negativity can be explained by Almodvar reacting to outside contemporary events. Certainly it is his first film which is not obviously connected with Spain. A revenge thriller centering on the main theme of a mad scientist deploying transgenesis, the film is set in Toledo in Almodvars home area of La Mancha, but it could be anywhere. The story centers on sinister plastic surgeon Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) who is keeping a girl named Vera Cruz (Elena Anaya taking full advantage of Penlope Cruzs pregnancy) in a room on his country estate El Cigarral under laboratory conditions and with the help of his mother Marilia (Marisa Paredes).

The plot concerns how Vera came to be in the room and how she escapes. As per usual with Almodvar the narrative is complex and is teased out a-chronologically through flashbacks, dreams and unlikely melodrama. In a nutshell, Ledgard has lost both his wife Gal and his daughter Norma (Blanca Surez) to separate suicides. Gal was a burn victim from a car crash who later threw herself out of a window when she caught sight of her hideous reflection. Norma had been witness to this and was recovering from the trauma induced by it when she was sexually accosted at a party by local fashion boutique salesclerk Vincente (Jan Cornet). The experience renewed her trauma which in turn led to her following her mother out of a window. In the films present Ledgard devotes his life to two passions  to research and produce a new human skin that resists burns, and to punish the man who effectively sent his daughter to her early death. So he kidnaps and experiments on Vincente. The twist is that as well as developing a new skin, he also changes Vincente into a girl. He gives him hormone therapy, a vaginoplasty and breasts. But he doesnt change him into just any girl. He changes him into the very image of his dead wife Gal. This causes trouble for when Ledgards half-brother Zeca (Roberto lamo) comes to visit his biological mother Marilia he mistakes Vera for Gal and rapes her thinking he is meeting again the woman with whom he was having an affair when they both had their car crash. Also, Marilias maternal jealousy is aroused when Ledgard later allows Vera to take care of him. Trapped inside the body of Vera Vincente however has been spending the time desperately trying to cling on to his identity and he eventually gets the chance to escape by shooting both Ledgard and Marilia dead. The film finishes with Vincente returning to his mothers shop and declaring his identity through Veras body.

Gender-bending has long been the preserve of Almodvar, a director born out of the transgressive Movida Madrilea artistic renaissance after the death of Franco in 1975. Having built a career out of attack (on Francoism) and celebration (of democracy) in films which center on transience and identity-search in three different areas (politics/society, the human body/sexuality and of the artistic creative impulse itself [story-telling, cinema history and a very knowing postmodernism]), transsexuality (the desire for authenticity to resemble who youve dreamed you are as voiced by Agrado in All About My Mother) is the very expression of a freedom denied to Spanish people for 40 years of Francoist rule. The depressed world atmosphere post-9/11 coupled with a down-turn in the fortunes of the Spanish economy perhaps lie behind Almodvars decision in The Skin I Live In to treat gender-bending as a punishment rather than an expression of freedom. In the same way all the other freedoms gained with the 1977 General Election prove to be illusory to reflect the sobering fact that most people in Spain were better off under Franco than they were three decades later.

Gender-bending is presented as a negative trapping mechanism as is sex itself. Of the three couplings we see in the film two are rapes (Zeca on Vera and then Vincente on Norma). The third is also incredibly cold. From Ledgards point of view sex with Vera/Vincente amounts to necrophilia with the image of his dead wife while from Vincentes point of view sex is a necessary thing to win Ledgards trust so that he can kill him. The oppressive control characters seek to effect on each other through sex here is a far cry from the positive sexual liberation of a film like Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! or the later Live Flesh.

Along with sex, drugs stop being the expression of liberty they were in early Almodvar and become the tools of use and abuse. Ledgard is the mad scientist who uses drugs to effect his weird schemes. He shoots Vincente with a tranquilizer gun, drugs his food, sedates him for the sex change operation, develops his new skin by using transgenesis-related chemicals and then administers hormone therapy to grow breasts and feminize Vincente completely, trapping him within a womans body. Furthermore, it is under the influence of speed that Vincente loses control of his actions at the party and attempts to sexually assault Norma. Norma is also under the influence of drugs. This is a point highlighted by a conversation between the two where they misunderstand each other. Vincente says he is on drugs and asks Norma if she is too. She is under her fathers medication for her trauma-related depression and so she says, Yes. Social drugs are thus equated with drugs meant for medication and are shown by Almodvar to be equally sinister. The only drug we see as innocently recreational is Ledgards opium pipe which significantly he never gets to enjoy even though he tries twice to do so. Again this is a far cry from a film like Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! where Marina falls in love with Ricky partly because he goes out on the streets to score heroin for her!

Looming over the twisting of once-positive freedoms into something altogether more sinister is the ice cold depiction of middle class Spanish society we are offered in the film. The General Election promised freedom for all, but the end result 30 years later is the tyranny of the haute bourgeoisie over those beneath them on the social scale, especially in this film the petite bourgeoisie as represented by Vincentes family shop. Almodvar dwells on the effect Vincentes abduction has on his mother (Susi Snchez) as she frantically tries to get the police interested in her sons disappearance. We see the haute bourgeoisie in sophisticated social gatherings, especially at a party where Ledgard talks to the un-named president of the bio-tech institute (Jos Luis Gmez) about the ethics of transgenesis and then at a sumptuous society wedding where it is emphasized that expensive medical research has been carried out merely to make the rich look better through cosmetic surgery rather than to help plain ordinary people. Furthermore the film offers the idea of the rich making themselves beautiful through the use and abuse of those further down the scale. Vincente is to an extent a social victim and slots alongside a number of other characters in Almodvar films (Antonio in The Law of Desire, Ignacio, Juan and Enrique in Bad Education) who are trapped in a rural environment yearning for escape  the very situation of Almodvar himself in the late 1970s. Interestingly, this idea receives even clearer expression in Almodvars next film Im So Excited! in which a plane is offered as a metaphor for Spanish society about to crash with economy class passengers knocked out by drugs while the first class passengers hedonistically party on throughout the night.

Transience and identity search usually plays out in Almodvar in the arena of artistic creativity with a discourse on postmodern themes, but in this film this is muted. There is no metafiction, no faction, no narrator debate, no creator doppelgngers for Almodvar and little meditation on the artistic process. To maintain his sanity (to insist his identity) Vincente takes to writing and drawing on the walls of his cell and to the making of papier mach figures based on a Louis Bourgeois book. It could also be argued that Ledgard is a plastic surgeon artist creating new bodies through unethical experimentation on humans. The only aspect of postmodernism to be fully present is the serial referencing to other films. Usually in Almodvar these are cleverly bedded into the narratives to hugely positive effect (Jean Cocteaus La Belle at la Bte in Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!, Ingmar Bergmans Autumn Sonata in The Flower of My Secret, Joseph Mankiewiczs All About Eve in All About My Mother, Luchino Viscontis Bellissima in Volver, Almodvars own Shrinking Lover within Talk to Her), but in The Skin I Live In the references are all negative ones to films which stress mans manipulation of fellow man and an underlying desire for megalomaniacal control. The main reference point is Georges Franjus Eyes Without a Face which features a another mad scientist this time prowling the streets at night for victims who will supply him the skin he needs to repair his daughters face. Then there is Don Siegels Invasion of the Body Snatchers which was a 50s allegory on an alien force (it could be either communism or fascism) taking over the bodies of innocent Americans. Hitchcocks Rebecca also provides very obvious reference points  the spirit of the dead wife hovering over the house of the bereaved husband, the suicide by jumping from a second floor window which Joan Fontaine almost does, but which both Gal and Norma actually do, the Mrs. Danvers-like omnipresence of Ledgards mother Marilia who jealously cares for her son and resents Veras help. Most sinister of all perhaps is the base reference to Fritz Langs Metropolis with Ledgard playing Rotwang as he brings his wife back to life in the shape of somebody/something else. Here the wife is named Gal and changed by Ledgard into Vera Cruz (a reference to Robert Aldrichs 1954 Western of the same title in which Sara Montiel [Almodvars childhood cherished movie idol who he famously brings back to life in the part-autobiographical Bad Education] plays the love interest). In Metropolis the wife is named Hel and changed by Rotwang on Joahs command to Maria, the evil copy of a Messiah figure who manipulates a whole city to destruction.

The purpose of serial referencing to other works of art within a postmodern text is usually to acknowledge what has gone before and build on it afresh and in Almodvars best films there is a wonderful feeling of the old ingredients of cinema being shaken up and taken in a new direction, to an exotic place which hasn't been essayed before. This is most effective when he pushes social/sexual taboos to their very limits (eg; sexual abduction in Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!, rape in Kika and Talk to Her, incest in Volver) to approach uncomfortable truths which scarcely get voiced in mainstream cinema. In The Skin I Live In the referencing doesnt succeed in doing this. Indeed, it serves to confine the film within the bounds of what has already been done. Not only has the Frankenstein mad scientist theme been done to death elsewhere, it has been done much better by the various filmmakers I identify above. This makes the present film little more than an academic exercise even if the acting and Jos Luis Alcaines photography (showcasing the extraordinary production designs of Antxn Gmez  check out the interiors of Ledgards house!) combine with a polished script to make a fine aesthetically appealing end product. Special mention should also be accorded to Alberto Iglesias and his wonderful music score seguing from Philip Glass-like violin ostinatos to tranquil piano most effectively. The coldness on display here can be justified by Almodvars concern with present day Spanish society skating perilously close to disaster in a gloomy post-9/11 world and the way he has twisted his usual themes to take this on-board is admirable in a way, but I for one see the world of Almodvar as being fundamentally warm and full of positive things to say about the human condition. That seems to be a million miles away from The Skin I Live In which I hope will quickly become more The Skin He Lived In as he moves on snakelike to things altogether more positive in the future. Im So Excited! is superficially more positive even if the view of Spanish society remains bleak and we must wait and see if the upcoming Julietta will lighten the gloom even further.

The quality of this DVD release is outstanding, the visuals (aspect ratio 16:9 Widescreen 1.85:1) bold and clear and the sound (5.1 Dolby Digital) bright and transparent. There are no extras worthy of note outside a brief montage of production images and a short interview with Almodovar and Anaya given before the films 2011 premier at Somerset House, London, both speaking in English.",1459814400,3,15357,4.910631741140215

4493184,5,B004X9YNNO,"Complex, visually gorgeous, sumptuous cinematography.  A fascinating and at times shocking script.

It's a multi-layered film, but in part, it's about a doctor who plays God. He uses another human as a test subject in an absolutely detached, absolutely cold-blooded manner. Then, he falls in love with his creation.  But the film is about much more.

It has a vaguely futuristic feel, and yet you can't put your finger on why (other than a car that is..vaguely futuristic? merely electric? exotic?)

It's about the kinds of things that can go on behind closed doors. It's partly about how even when people may have suspicions or some kind of awareness of foul or even sickening happenings, they can simply look the other way. It's partly about willful ignorance in the form of professional courtesy. Ethics overlooked in the pursuit of science.

It's partly about how a man can love a woman and yet have no qualms about keeping her (literally) captive. It's partly about how grief can twist and deform, change a person. It's partly about extreme barbarism co-existing with and masked by civilization and gentrification.

It's about a man losing his mind and his ethics and morals and yet being given leeway either because of privileged social and/or professional status or because of familial loyalty.

It's about pushing the boundaries of science. It's about loss of identity, and about assimilation and adaptation in lieu of death. About survival and tenacity, about how deceiving appearances can be, how someone can think and feel entirely at odds with an alternate identity or veneer that they maintain, or that is thrust upon them, and about the temporality versus permanence of change.",1426291200,,1691,5.057553956834532

When I selected the movie, based on the previews, I thought that it was the story of a gifted cosmetic surgeon who restored the face of a beautiful burn victim. I expected a feel-good story with a happy ending. Had I known more about the works of Almodovar, I would have had different expectations !

Dr. Legard (Antonio Banderas), a renowned surgeon, operates a clinic where he researches the latest advances on skin restoration. We learn via flashbacks that he lost his wife after a terrible accident in which she was badly scarred by fire. His daughter is also emotionally damaged as a result. We start to glimpse images on a closed circuit camera of a slender woman completely ensconced in a skintight body suit who appears to be locked In an austere room at Legard's home/clinic. But she seems to be calm and content to be there. Why is she there? What is wrong with her? Why is she not able to leave?  The housekeeper is complicit with the doctor and seems to be the only other person who knows about the patient.

The patient's back story and predicament is revealed through flashbacks interwoven with current scenes, and the horror of the story builds scene by scene. It is impossible to predict how the plot will proceed and you will be astonished at the conclusion.

The genre of this film is described as ""drama, horror, thriller"" and all of those descriptors exist in equal measure. There is violence, graphic sex and language in this fascinating character study. You will not be able to tear yourself away from the screen.",1380499200,,1810,4.697160883280757
4493237,5,B004X9YNNO,"I bought this movie sight unseen because I like Banderas and Elena Anaya, neither one disappoints. Anaya is pretty much the perfect woman physically (I've never met her) and Banderas is handsome of course and has an intensity about his acting that transcends nationalities. This was a tighter, more stylish film than I thought it would be.
At first I dismissed it as another Human Centipede kind of movie but it is far far better than that. A sleek, sophisticated, stylish thriller.
Sure there's a lot of violence and nudity and shocking moments but it's also a very cool movie and I had no problems watching the characters interact or understanding their intentions.
The director/writer is brilliant and never mind what anyone says about the film being disturbing because it's genius and one of the most original thrillers I've seen in a long long time.
I would equate this more with David Cronenberg's The Fly and Dead Ringers (two films I love) than with anything else. It's main theme of transformation and experimentation resides within both of those films as well, I just wonder what Vera's life would be like after the credits roll. It would be great to see a sequel to this or even a trilogy like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo which is another disturbingly-beautiful film I would equate this with, but only if the director remained and only if Elena Anaya would continue her role and if the standards of quality both in directing and in writing would not diminish....",1378512000,4,1477,4.796078431372549

4493243,5,B004X9YNNO,"I recently began exploring the films of Antonio Banderas and have seen the lighter, popular work and enjoy the intelligent humor in those characters very much (Zorro, Puss in Boots, Desperado.) I especially like the depth of his voice and intonation, so my first feeling when I began this film was one of disappointment when I realized it was in Spanish and I would need to read the English subtitles. This detracts from the intensity of a film for me, but from the first scene, I was surprised to find that I became unaware that I was reading subtitles. I think the visual communication and the intonations in his voice are so strong that they focused my attention and made reading the subtitles almost a subliminal action. At the end of the movie, I felt that I had fully experienced the characters' physical and facial communication even though some part of my attention must have gone to reading the subtitles. I think this was true for all the characters, but especially true for Antonio Banderas' character.

This is a movie I will watch many times to fully understand the detail in it. It's fascinating to watch the first time, but after you finish it, you think of scenes that haunt your imagination and you want to see it again to see if you missed something, or to see if there's a deeper meaning, or to see how it all fits together.

Having seen only a few Antonio Banderas movies thus far, I was startled at the complexity of this character. All the movies I've seen have been enjoyable and he does interesting characters with detail and intelligence, but Dr. Ledgard is absolutely extraordinary!",1363737600,,1608,4.678445229681979

4493246,5,B004X9YNNO,"The Skin I Live In is a really interesting departure from Almodovar's usual emotional, human-interest story films, of which my favorite is Talk To Her.  It's not quite a horror movie, but it's close.  As other reviewers have noted, knowing any more than the very barest bones of the story will spoil it for you, so I'm not saying much more than it's about a doctor whose wife was badly burned in a car accident and who is working on a new type of skin.  His laboratory is in his home, and in addition to his skin project, he has a young female patient under observation.  Who she is and why she's there is a mystery for a while.  I found it a little slow and confusing at the beginning, but once it got going, I was hooked and it kept my interest throughout.  I'd compare this movie to Frankenstein, Freaks, and the Human Centipede, with a little David Lynch thrown in. It's well-acted, especially by Antonio Banderas and Marisa Paredes.  Almodovar's films are always thought-provoking; this one goes a little farther.  See it with other people - I guarantee you'll be talking about it all night.",1360713600,,1096,4.527918781725888

It's a film about revenge, desperation, dependence and ultimately survival. It's not one you want to miss.

4493266,5,B004X9YNNO,"I'm going to keep this review nice and short, because I really can't make it very detailed. The film is about plastic surgeon Robert Ledgard, who is still sorrowful after the traumatic death of his wife. He has become a hermit, trying desperately to create a form of skin that is impervious to injury. Once he decides to make a living human his guinea pig, his descent into deep psychological insanity begins.

This film is incredibly twisty, and one must pay very close attention to it. It celebrates the film noir style, which is something that Pedro Almodovar has never really pinpointed in his films before. I went into this film knowing very little about it, and that's the way it should be. I was shocked, appalled and extremely engrossed in the many twists that the film holds. It's even more interesting during a second viewing, when you notice subtleties that make the film even more fantastic.

Almodovar is known for his sweeping love stories of epic grandeur, which is sort of absent in ""The Skin I Live In"". He keeps his universal themes of family, trust, or lack thereof, unity and the struggle of his most celebrated heroines, in a different kind of woman than his fans are used to. Walk into this movie knowing little about it. It's pure excitement, shock and awe. You won't be disappointed.

4493268,4,B004X9YNNO,"There will be two views here.

1. This is not Almodovar's greatest or best or really even highest quality work; which doesn't mean it isn't good. He is a master director; Always true to his medium (spacing of actors, color of sets and costumes, mood and pace of story, music. All are given wonderful attention.) He is consistently distinct, provocative, deep, emotionally true and interesting. It is just that the way he got me through the story wasn't as fluid and stylish as his past work, nor was the destination all that satisfying, given the journey a certain character takes. The other characters almost shrink in hindsight to what the ""main"" character goes through, and in such silence, such calculated, over stylized submission....

2. This is an unforgettable film for several of reasons; one of them amazingly perverse, disturbing, realistic, awe inspiring (in the negative sense), timely (Hostel, Human Centipede, Saw(s), etc.) and deeply dark. Anyone who is too good (or shallow, or tired) for subtitles will miss a high quality horror film that no Hollywood/NY studio can allow itself to produce (only remake-albeit suspectly). They will also miss a chance to contemplate the sexual and social questions the film brings up (or indulges in). And what else does the medium of cinema need to offer, short of mind numbing visuals that render sense and logic irrelevant?",1344384000,,1378,5.066079295154185
4493269,4,B004X9YNNO,"If you want to fully enjoy ""The Skin I Live in"" (""La piel que habito""), the latest film by Pedro Almodvar (""All About My Mother"" ""Talk to Her""), perhaps you should not see the film's trailers which I think reveal too much. All you have to know is that Antonio Banderas plays Dr. Robert Ledgard, a genius scientist and plastic surgeon, and that the story is about a horrible secret about ""the skin someone lives in.""

Almodvar keeps a measured pace in the film's first half, where you will meet most of the principal characters. Elena Anaya plays Vera Cruz (yes, that's her name), a beautiful woman who, it seems, is held captive in a beautifully decorated room monitored by cameras. Be patient and follow the small clues as to what really happened to the doctor and the woman.

Based on a French writer Thierry Jonquet's novel, ""The Skin I Live in"" unfolds like a Hitchcock thriller with Banderas, who looks like a darker version of Cary Grant. Part melodrama, part crime drama, the film is also a love story - not a usual one, of course. Pedro Almodvar tells the story with confidence, and if the film is not scientifically convincing, it is still chilling and thrilling, especially in the second half.

Finally, in ""The Skin I Live in"" Antonio Banderas delivers one of his career best performances. If I am not mistaken, Almodvar and Banderas have not worked together since ""tame!"" that was made in 1990. I would like to see them working together again.",1343347200,,1455,4.653696498054475

4493272,4,B004X9YNNO,"Pedro Almod&oacute;var continues to craft an impressive cinematic career by paying the best type of homage to Alfred Hitchcock--without blatantly copying Hitchcock, Almod&oacute;var appropriates his style, his tone, and his penchant for terrifying subject matter and translates these elements into original, contemporary stories that Hitchcock himself would have surely told if he were alive today and living in Spain.

""The Skin I Live In"" focuses on Robert Ledgard (played by Antonio Banderas in what is undoubtedly the most sophisticated performance of his career), a plastic surgeon who has endured more than his share of tragedy--an unfaithful wife who suffers a horribly disfiguring accident, a traumatized daughter unable to cope with her family's misfortune and other indignities, and a childhood and family history of his own that is shrouded in mystery. As he himself slips into madness, Ledgard uses his skill as a surgeon to exact a most horrifying type of revenge on the man who seemingly damaged his daughter beyond repair--and then uses that revenge in a gruesome charade that satisfies his longing for the happiness that has long since left him.

In telling this contemporary Gothic tale, Almod&oacute;var tackles a number of grand themes--power, love, delusion, desire--in a way that exploits our preconceptions of gender and identity. ""The Skin I Live In"" is a unique film. If you're already an Almod&oacute;var fan, you'll surely enjoy it.

The Skin I Live In takes it waaaaaaay out there. It also goes to show if you give Antonio Banderas a meaty role in his own language that he has a far greater acting range than he seems to have in English-speaking roles.

Needless to say this is a clever yet creepily inventive movie that not only flips the psycho-sexual thriller on its edge but walks it around the block a few times and spits it out in a horrifying mix of sexual perversity, very dubious medical ethical choices and a weirdness you're not likely to see anywhere else.

Extras on the DVD are a waste. The ""Making Of"" is a just 12 minutes of raw footage where you see cameras and boom mics in scenes. The ""Red Carpet NYC Premiere"" is better as you hear from the actors and director but it is extremely short.",1338422400,,938,4.4476744186046515
4493280,4,B004X9YNNO,"Finding an improbable middle ground between classic ""Frankenstein"" and torture porn, Pedro Almodovar delivers this unsettling film with his old buddy from his 1990 ""Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!, Antonio Banderas.  Here Bandaras plays Dr. Robert Ledgard a prominent plastic surgeon in Spain who has crossed ethical boundaries in developing a genetically grown skin impervious to pain and some diseases.  His subject, a beautiful young woman named Vera (Elena Anaya) appears to be a patient, but is also a prisoner of sorts, locked in a room in Roberto's villa.

In a series of flashbacks that take us back 6 years we learn that Dr. Ledgard's wife was a bit unstable and began an affair with Roberto's strange half brother (he is unaware of that bio-link).  They were involved in a serious auto accident.  The brother, Zeca (Roberto Alamo) walked away but the wife was seriously burned and ultimately takes her own life.  There is also a daughter, Norma (Blanca Suarez) who has psychiatric issues of her own.  At about 17, while at a wedding, she meets a young man named Vicente (Jan Cornet).  They are both strung out on pills, take a walk in the garden and one thing leads to another.  She begins to panic, starts screaming and Vicente heads for the hills.

The doctor finding his daughter unkempt, tracks down Vicente and tranquilizes him.  Taken to an underground storage area in his house, Ledgard can now avenge a wrong he believes was perpetrated on his daughter but has found the right guinea pig for his experiments.  Things get really weird after that leading back to the current day.  I will admit, this film had me squirming in my seat most of the time.  In an unforgiving roll, Banderas is very good as the twisted doctor.  The character and the film could have easily taken a laughable turn, but it doesn't.  The subject matter is very disquieting and will likely turn off many viewers.  Miss Anaya is very good and dare I say a real eyeful.

The Blu ray transfer is by the always reliable Sony and is delivered in 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  As with nearly all Sony Blu ray discs, the picture is nearly perfect.  Clear, crisp and colorful in the right perspective.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is likewise excellent.  The source material isn't demo worthy but you should have no problem with room filling sound.",1337558400,,2326,4.719602977667494
4493281,3,B004X9YNNO,"Firstly, I saw nothing that said the movie had English subtitles and I'm not at all fond of reading movies, but that being said this movie does have a mesmerizing quality.  Antonio Banderas is intense, charming, and brutal.

I do agree that it is best to go into this movie knowing nothing about it, but I didn't find it as shocking as a few other reviewers, nor did I find the plot twists all that surprising.  Maybe because from early on I felt this was much like a fantasy - like Edward Scissorhands without the comedy.  In fact, Johnny Depp could have played this role with the same charming intensity.

Now don't read further because the rest will contain spoilers that I found so completely absurd.  So absurd, in fact, that it really should have been pushed further and been made a dark comedy.

Adam's apple, cleft chin, hips??  All without hormones?  Nose job, lip enhancement, permanent lip dye??  Higher, softer voice??  Oh, please!  And why was she ever bald?  Giving someone a vagina does not make them a woman any more then me having Ben-wah balls makes me a man.

Is this one of these 'You had to read the book' - then if I would have read the book I would've thought the movie was a total dud and angry I spent even a nickle on it?

Anyway, as I said, would have been much better pushed a bit further into the dark comedy genre.  As for the 'thought provoking' the only thought I'm entertaining is how nice it would be to have skin that repelled bugs.",1337472000,,1583,4.803703703703704
4493282,5,B004X9YNNO,"Pedro Almodovar prolific filmmaking has been inconsistent lately, Volver, Talk to her and Broken embraces may have received accolades but the benchmark for him will be this film. Such is the impact this film has on the viewers. La piel que habito is the title of the original spanish film adapted from a book by Thierry Jonquet's Tarantula (original French title: Mygale) by Pedro Almodvar. Weird but truly disturbing are the words that come to my mind immediately but that said this is a enjoyable film and a must see.

It is about Robert Ledgard, a brilliant world class plastic surgeon, who failed to save his wife after a car crash that left almost 90 percent of her body and face scarred forever. He becomes single minded in his pursuit to make the perfect skin that will be resistant to fire. In a important part of the story this film is also about Vera ( Elena Anaya) and how she became his experiment.

Although the pace is sometimes slow nevertheless the film is based on many complex layers. Among the most prominent are control, justice, a fathers love for his daughter and a husbands mad obsession. The central plot will have you cringing at the end, believe me- you may think you know the film but this is unlike you have ever seen.
Anthony Banderas is in top form and once again shows what a great actor he truly is. Elena Anaya is wonderful as the hapless victim who finds her life changed forever by Ledgard. Jan Cornet's Vicente will probably evoke the most sympathy as an night of overindulgence fulled mistake sets of a chain of unfortunate events altering his life for the worse.
This is not a easy film as sex, forced sexuality and rape are frequent- those with underage children please beware. One of the best films I have seen this year. 5 stars. 4/19/2012",1337472000,3,1780,4.59433962264151

4493288,4,B004X9YNNO,"Pedro Almodvar is probably the most well known and revered European filmmaker working today. Ever since he directed ""All About my Mother"" in 1999, he has taken storytelling to new, turbulent depths. He reaches the highest peak in that regard with ""The Skin I Live In,"" a beautiful yet incredibly sick, corrupt, and perverse story about a mad scientist and his creation. It is at times a difficult film to watch, but not so much for its blood (we see very little of it) but for its aberrant chain of developments. Beautifully shot and performed, the movie leaves a queasy feeling at the very end (which is the reason I rate this 4 stars and not 5). The very last scene feels, in my opinion, a bit abrupt. Instead of the camera fading to black, I would have liked the camera to linger a bit more on the expressions, on the reaction of Vera's mother. It is a minor complain, since that scene also serves to underplay any emotion on the characters' part so that we are the ones feeling and taking in the life-scarring tragedy that Vera has undergone. Highly recommended. But beware: this film is not for everyone. It is a very intense and disturbing film.",1334707200,,1151,4.538461538461538

PROS:
- Solid acting
- Great casting

- Well executed storyline (and what a story!)

- The beginning and the middle kept me intrigued

CONS:
- Rape scene (I always appreciate a heads up on that)
- I agree with some of the reviews about the ending.  It was a simple ending.  I expected some kind of emotional break down or something more intense.

4493292,5,B004X9YNNO,"A fascinating and powerful departure for Almodovar, or perhaps more
accurately more an terrific hybrid of the best of his old and new.
This has the darker, more actively perversely disturbing and violent themes
of some of his early work like 'Matador' but shot and directed with the
far smoother and more mature hand he has developed over the years. It
also uses the more complex and fractured time structure style of
Almodovar's more recent work, to great effect.

In the end it's a gorgeous looking, philosophically complex mystery and
horror film. Although not gory, this is a disturbing work, both on a
literal story level, and also for the questions it raises about sexual and personal
identity, love, sado-masochism, and passion run amok.

These themes are all Almodovar touchstones, but delivered here with a
visually stunning icy touch, and with much more complete logic than in
his early works, which often felt less fully thought through, and had
more frustrating plot holes and character leaps.

Not a 'scary' film, but a creepy, moody and highly effective one. A
dark fairy tale as told by, say Stanley Kubrick.

It's good to see Antonio Banderas reunited with Almodovar, and he
delivers a wonderfully complex and quirky modern day Dr. Frankenstein.

Less emotional than my two very favorite Almodovar films (Talk to Her,
All About My Mother), but its exciting to see this extremely talented
film maker continue to evolve and grow, and I think this represents
work that can stand among his best.",1333756800,16,1507,4.964285714285714

4493295,5,B004X9YNNO,"Pedro Almodvar  has created so many superb surrealistic yet intensely human films that it s no surprise that he should enter the genre of horror stories.  THE SKIN I LIVE IN (La piel que habito) takes us deep inside a terrifying concept and yet for all the potential for being a gore fest he manages to make it one of his finest explorations of the human psyche.

Dr. Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) lives in a mansion with his servant: Marilla (Marisa Paredes) is the head of the household and happens to be Robert's mother as well - Roberto having been raised by the family for whom Marilla was working at the time the head of the household impregnated her. Robert is a plastic surgeon and has committed his teaching and research and creativity towards perfecting a type of skin that sustain fire, cuts, and insects, and despite the lack of backing of his prestigious colleagues to extend this work toward work with humans, Robert is working in secret in his home trying to devise a skin that would have helped his late wife severely burned in an auto accident. His patient in progress is Vera Cruz (Elena Anaya) on whom Robert works day and night to perfect his `invention' of perfect skin. In a typical Almodvar move, a strange man in a tiger costume (for Carnival) arrives at Robert's home: Zeca (Roberto lamo) is a criminal on the run, needs money, happens to be the other son of Marilla, and is the one responsible for the fiery accident that disfigured Robert's wife who subsequently committed suicide when after surviving the accident sees her own distorted image in a window and leaps to her death.

The film takes us back six years to explain the events: Robert's daughter Norma (Blanca Surez) has been hospitalized and medicated for mental illness since she observed her mother's suicide.  But she goes to a party where she is desired by a young lad Vicente (Jan Cornet) and in the throes of drugs the two enter into an attempted sexual liaison that is discovered by Roberto.  What happens after this is best left unsaid as the key to the terror of the film has begun and sharing more would deprive the viewer of the suspense and brilliance of the script.

The story was adapted by Pedro Almodvar and Agustn Almodvar from a French novel `Tarantula' by Thierry Jonquet, the phenomenal musical score was written by Alberto Iglesias, and the haunting cinematography is the work of Jos Luis Alcaine. Blessed with a cast of magnificent actors (Almodvar's usual entourage plus more) Pedro Almodvar directs this fascinating film to new heights, even for him.  The story is complex and while it is bizarre in almost every aspect, it remains a film that explores the human psyche, the power of love, revenge, and the extremes seemingly ordinary people will go if motivated. It is a brilliant film that only grow better with repeated viewings.  Grady Harp, March 12",1332374400,3,2869,4.733466933867735
4493296,5,B004X9YNNO,"Wow. If you are often bored with Hollywood movies, or lament yet another car chase (yawn) and yet another way of killing somebody (b-o-o-ring), and maybe you're interested in world cinema, you could do worse than to start with Pedro Almodovar, a sexually complex Spanish director who, even in his youth, managed to find unique, funny and horrifying truths, with characters who stayed with you. Now, in his prime, the genius works with longtime collaborators editor Jose Salcedo and cinematographer Jose Luis Alcaine in a film produced (and co-written) by his brother, Agustin Almodovar.

He gets an amazing performance from Antonio Banderas, who finally gets to shake off that ""Spy Kids"" taint and dive into dark, dark waters, making believable the unthinkable. If the director's early movies found bits of truth, this masterpiece leaves us with a heady trip wrapped around skin, gender, identity, revenge, obsession -- all those things that have defined great art through the millennia. If film is the art and literature of our generation, then Almodovar is our Picasso, our Van Gogh, our Aeschylus -- a genius trying to communicate with apes. At the same time he wallows in humanity's casual violence and thoughtless cruelty, he also manages to end on a note of hope and redemption. The characters stay with you. There are the elements of Mr. Almodovar's past films -- the hyperdrama and complex human relationships, the gorgeous eye and the outrageous stories, all compelling you to watch. Brief camera shots that take your breath away. It's Tarantino on estrogen.

The story unfolds in the home of brilliant plastic surgeon, Roberto. He seems to be holding a beautiful woman prisoner, assisted by his devoted housekeeper and confidante, who might also be his mother. When this peaceful, if bizarre, household is invaded by an unexpected guest, new drama unfolds and we enter a long backstory where we learn who these people are and how they came together, and to this. When we return to the present day, we see that nothing is what we thought it was. In the tradition of the best films, we emerge from the viewing with a mind re-shaped by Almodovar.

If you are ready to see what film CAN be, to have your mind twisted and your little head pumped full of big ideas, try this out. If you are already an Almodovar fan, you will absolutely love this.

4493298,3,B004X9YNNO,"Antonio Banderas fans will love this movie. It is subtitled but still easy to follow along and most of the action, and movie sequences can be gathered without even focusing heavily on the sub-script. With that being said this movie was ""HIT"" and ""MISS"" for me. One moment you are saying ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT"" and the next you have to scratch your head as to where exactly was this movie driving to.

Is it worth the rent?

Yes, if you are not having to fork out more than say 4 bucks for it. There are interesting concepts subtly woven within the fabric of the movie. Such as love, and the loss of a loved one, and to what extremes one will go to, to re-capture what is lost.

This movie definitely has a part where you are saying to yourself ""NO WAY, HE DID NOT JUST DO THAT""? Yet, once you get past the initial thrill of that film sequence, the viewer is sorta left in limbo as to how it should tidy up it's loose ends, and bring the film to a nice tidy conclusion. On shock value alone this film is worth the rent, but the conclusion at the end of the film will leave many viewers scratching their head asking ""is that it""?

As for me, I would recommend it for your enjoyment, just do not expect it to knock your socks off. At best it will leave you a lasting impression into what can be done, and is done in the world of plastic surgery and the quest for love on a slightly obsessed and creepy level.

I'll sum up this film without giving away any spoilers or without divulging too many details, just that it's a revenge flick with elements of Frankenstein mixed in with it. And when I say that this is a revenge movie, that is a big BIG understatement to say the least. If you are OK with Takashi Miike's earlier stuff like Gozu or Visitor Q, or if you occasionally crave films like Happiness, The Girl Next Door, Irreversible, A Clockwork Orange, The Piano Teacher--well-done ""art"" films that mess with your head--this film is right up your alley. Everyone else, stay as far from this innocent-looking creature as you possibly can because it bites!

This film has everything Pedro's previous films has. It's deliciously colorful, gorgeously shot, sensual, kinky, intelligent, surprising. To me, the biggest surprise of this film is the ease by which the sci fi part of the story is told in that it doesn't feel distracting or that it needs to be overly technical. Now, the movie does set up slowly at the beginning from a present day perspective but once the film backtracks to what caused the present situation this is where all the surprises and goodies are.

4493303,5,B004X9YNNO,"It is impossible to describe the ""action"" without spoilers so I wont. There are so many levels to this piece, and each scene allows for so much creativity and depth on the part of the director - and the acting is flawless. Banderas is our modern-day Frankenstein, in an edgy-revenge-erotic-psychotic masterpiece. The last sentence in the movie wraps it up rather well, in that we all ""project"" - thru our loves and hates, what we want others to be.
The ""master-Frankenstein"" becomes infactuated by his creation as well as a beautiful rendition of the ""who's in charge?"" as the ""victim"" realizes her power over the one who has her imprisoned.
There remains, at the end, a statement that a victim is still a victim, and who we ARE in some ways is simply WHO WE ARE - regardless of the skin we're wrapped in, or - apparently, the guilt of a perpetrator-turned-victim. The extra attention to plot development is fantastic, altho I think they edited out scenes that would have more quickly identified Norma as Bandaras' daughter. I thought the clothes she's wearing when she's first introduced in the film made her look like a servant. Maybe just me. : Bad guys don't just appear, they talk there way past emotional mothers; we find Bandaras' last wife to have been something other than what we wud think, all conveyed in a single sentence by a rapist.

What was such a RELIEF - that even tho i believe the director Almodovor is gay - he allows his art to flourish without the American heavy-handedness of Left-wing proselytizing. For example, a father goes to visit his raped and now psychotic daughter in a mental hospital. She cannot recognize him and becomes terrified, altho the father is sensitive, thoughtful and loving. If it was a Hollywood movie, the father would be a knuckle-dragging mentally brutish idiot, who would have to be asked to leave by the intelligent-sensitive-minority-skinned-doctor; to whom the brutish father would refer to with a slur, and probably drive off with a ""Vote Republican"" bumper sticker on his gas-guzzler.

The film is certainly a must for Almodovar fans, but,  unfortunately, this is not one of his best films. Discussing the film's plot would be a disservice to anyone who has not seen the film: as other reviewers have noted, the less one knows about the film going into it, the better. The Skin I Live In is a bit confusing at first (deliberately so), but by the time we finally get to where we supposed to be going Almodovar seems to have painted himself into a corner and has little direction to go except for the predictable melodrama that ensues. The film contains the wonderful trademark Almodovar use of color (and in the case of this film, lack of color in many scenes to enhance the notion of sterility in all its many forms), but what it sadly lacks are the usual touches of Almodovar playfulness and, especially, humanity.

The Skin I Live is a film with a unique plot, very well dramatized, high intensity story, some super acting and ended making me wish there were maybe three of four minutes more to it.

Of whatever little I have seen of Antonio Banderas, this is his best film.

The director Pedro Almodvar has made some outrageous films. Let's talk - ""All about my mother"" , ""Volver"" , ""Broken Embraces"" , ""Talk to her"" were made with such a heavy unforgiving sincerity. His work, I dare add is no less than a great book or a great painting which lasts for years - it is art. Of these films, All About My Mother was the most poignant one but imagine this  - I think the director may just have raised the bar a little with ""The Skin I Live In""

A real treat and easily among my top 5 films of 2011. The makers of the film deserve all the academy awards they can get but I won't be surprised if this is overlooked as it doesn't have a political message but there is a wondrous world this director manages to create within his films and for the love of that, this film deserves to be watched.

It is exactly what I expect from Spanish director Pedro Aldomavar.  His lead, Antonia Banderas worked with him before he came to America and this is their first reunion in decades.  They are a good pairing.

We begin in the present with a plastic surgeon, Robert Legard (Banderas),.  He is also a medical researcher who is constantly trying to create better skin because of his late wife who suffered hideous burns in a car crash.  He was not able to give her better skin so he keeps trying to do it long after her death.  Oddly he has a young woman patient, Vera, who stays in his mansion as sort of a trial patient.  She is very beautiful and young. He experiments with his new skin attempts on Vera but he never actually mars her.  In fact, he seems to be building Vera to be a duplicate of his late wife, except better.

We are told that there is both a strain of madness that runs through Legard's family as well as a history replete with tragedy.  Vera is tied up with both.  In order to find out how, we flash back to six years earlier and see Legrand when his wife and daughter were still alive. That ends in tragedy and Legrand's penchant for madness starts twisting its way into his psyche as he finds himself alone.

I thought it was very good but for those who are expecting something like NIP N TUCK, except in Spanish, this is about as far from that tv show as it is possible to be.

4493313,5,B004X9YNNO,"I am lucky to have seen this film after a visit to a Dali exhibition where I surveyed his Divina Commedia and the Dinner with Gala paintings.

Almodovar's brush strokes are clean and directly applied to the screen. His depiction of the characters are the same way. The sane and the insane occupy the same frames, acting their parts beautifully, with no exaggeration or understatement. But the undertones, the queezy feeling you get and the occasional desire you have to divert your eyes from the screen, hold your partners hand and to reassure her and yourself that her world is nothing like the one you are watching worms its way under your skin after the first few seconds and does not let go.

When you look at Dali paintings you have distorted images and perfectly drawn people and you try to figure out the meanings of the distorted images. Here, in the film, you have perfectly drawn images, scenes, sets but you are on the lookout for the distortion that you know is hidden there. The distortion is internal to the people and to the script and to the sets and even the music (just try to dance to that music with that song) or the few instances of humor which we enjoyed much.

Almodovar is definitely one of those who bears that torch of Spanish visual and written art, and carries on the tradition of the mixture of the natural and the not so natural occupying the same bodies.

We did not fall in love with this film but watched it with awe, felt a great deal of stress afterwards and did not wish to speak about it. Now, I think it was because Almodovar said it all, and said it so well that the viewer has nothing else to add to that. I just wish I can find a Garcia Lorca play to watch soon to complete this trilogy.",1325635200,4,1729,4.376947040498442
4493314,1,B004X9YNNO,"It is advertised as a science fiction but a better description would be a weak horror story.

**** Warning this review contains spoilers *****

A woman commits suicide after a sexual experience that involves violence and possibly rape.  Her father, who has a history of tragedy in his personal life in revenge kidnaps the guy who had sex with his daughter. The father then does a sex change operation on the guy against his will. Soon the guy is transformed into a beautiful woman whom the father falls in love with. Then she like Frankenstein, kills her creator and runs away.

There is little in the characters' development that I found interesting.

The acting was poor although Antonio Banderas did have his moments.

The filming is rather ordinary but nothing wrong with it, just ordinary.",1325376000,21,794,4.844444444444444
4493315,4,B004X9YNNO,"The most important thing I can tell you about Pedro Almodvar's film, The Skin I Live In (original Spanish title: La piel que habito) is that you should avoid as much as possible knowing anything about it beyond the most basic setup before seeing it. This is one of those cases where spoilers truly can rob you of the full experience of a film. I say this as someone who went into the movie knowing little about it beyond the fact that Pedro Almodvar directed it and that it had to do with a plastic surgeon obsessed with a mysterious female patient.  And that really is the best way to see it.

Adapted from Thierry Jonquet's novel Tarantula (original French title: Mygale) by Pedro Almodvar and his brother Agustn Almodvar, The Skin I Live In is a complex and, as the background layers are peeled away through revelation, deeply disturbing and chilling film.

It begins in the present day where we see Robert Legard (Antonio Banderas), a prominent plastic surgeon and medical researcher who, because of the tragic death of his wife in a fiery auto accident several years earlier, is obsessed with creating a new kind of skin superior to the skin we're born with, one that is not only both tougher and more resistant to burning and injury but also heals quicker and with little to no scarring. In his mansion, Dr. Legard has a special patient under his private, personal care, a young woman named Vera (Elena Anaya), on whom he is trying his new skin out. Our first impression is that Vera is a burn victim that Legrand is caring for, but it quickly becomes clear that Vera is more prisoner than patient. But just who is Vera? And how did she come into Legrand's rather questionable 'care'? And why does she so strongly resemble Legrand's dead wife?

As in so many his films, The Skin I Live In has many of Almodvar's almost trademark themes running all through it:  complex familial relationships; the intertwining of family and personal secrets; the nature of desire, brutality and obsession; the lengths to which individuals can and will go; how actions can have the most unexpected and sometimes devastating consequences, and how, ultimately, we can never escape our pasts.

The performances are pitch perfect, most particularly Antonio Banderas' controlled and controlling - and casually chilling - Legard, who has his mansion wired so that he can observe his 'patient' from almost any part of the house, and Elena Anaya's Vera with her perfect face and body and the haunted eyes that peer out from the skin she lives in, always aware that she is being observed. Added into the mix - and subtly working in other elements from classic standards of horror - are Marisa Paredes's Marilia, Legard's old housekeeper who serves as a kind of matronly Igor to Legard's Victor Frankenstein, fiercely loyal but openly disapproving; Roberto lamo's Zeca, a brutal criminal on the run who serves as a kind of Hyde to Legard's Jekyll - lust, rage and animal cunning to Legard's cool controlled calculation. And last but not least, Jan Cornet's Vicente, a callow young fool whose impulsive self-indulgence triggers a chain of events with consequences more dire than he could imagine. All of whom are bound to each other in ways known and unknown.

The only reason I rate this four stars instead of five and call it a near-masterpiece instead of an all-out masterpiece is in how the final acts play out. After taking the viewer through a series of ever deeper and increasingly disturbing revelations, Almodvar seems to settle for what I felt was a disappointingly conventional resolution. But that said, the film still stands out for all of the unexpected places it did take you before that slip back into the expected. There may be times when you'll think you've seen this movie before and you know what's going on, but I assure you, you haven't and you won't until the revelations have been made.

Highly recommended for any fan of Almodvar's and for anyone else who likes well-crafted films that really push the boundaries.",1324252800,97,4015,4.783549783549783
