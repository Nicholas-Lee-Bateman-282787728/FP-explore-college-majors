If you are a Tom-o-phile like I am, you have read all the Tom Ripley novels. You have all four or five of the films. Dating back to 1958 with the first Ripley film, Tom has been played by: Alan Delon, Dennis Hopper, Matt Damon, John Malkovich and Barry Pepper.  In this incarnation, Pepper is what you visualize Tom as looking like when you read the books. He is wonderful in this film.

The photography is breathtakingly beautiful. French countryside, Paris, London, French mansions. The entire film is awash in bright, bold colors.

The film follows the novel fairly close to Ms. Highsmith's writings. However, Mr. Spottiswoode takes liberties.  See the film. You'll be able to pick these fabricated moments out yourself. But they don't detract from the story. They add life to the scenes.

Alan Cumming (isn't he just wonderful?) plays the edgy gallery owner who takes a chance on Derwatt, the up-and-coming young artist to perfection. The camera just loves his face. He never disappoints. He lights up every scene he is in.

The lovely Claire Forlani plays the artist's Muse again. She was Basquiat's Muse in the film of the same name. She never seems to age. She is not only beautiful but a strong actress as well.

Willem Dafoe plays the American art buyer Murchinson.  Not quite a walk on or cameo, his time on screen is brief but dramatic. He keeps turning up, pardon my pun, until the end of the film.

Tom Wilkinson plays British Inspector Webster with his usual genius and grit.

Jacinda Barrett plays the lovely French love of Tom Ripley's life, Heloise. Born to aristocratic French parents, her chateau is stunningly beautiful inside and out. In this film her mother has died. Not the way Highsmith wrote it. But it works.

Barry Pepper is a strange choice for Ripley. Not that well known in 2005, Spottiswoode took a chance with him and made it work. Pepper is a very lithe, handsome young man who morphs into Tom from the beginning of the film. He carries the movie beautifully and is totally convincing as the dastardly Tom. You can't help but fall in love with him. You are rooting for him from first frame to last.

I wish they would re-release this Tom Ripley film again now that Pepper is better known.  I think it would find a new, enthusiastic audience.

I won't tell you how much I paid for this DVD because you'd have me committed. I loved this film so much I'd do it again in a heartbeat.  It is a real treat for Ripley fans. I highly recommend it to anyone who has read Ms. Highsmith's novels.",1412640000,,2727,4.512195121951219
