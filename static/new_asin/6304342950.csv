845836,3,6304342950,"Based on the book ""Jude the Obscure"" by Thomas Hardy.

Jude Fawley (Christopher Eccleston) is a stonemason who wants more than anything to take a college degree. He is essentially self-taught, studying Latin on his own, and reading whatever he could find. He is seduced by Arabella (Rachel Griffiths) and marries her when she tells him she is pregnant. But it was a bad match, and before long she ran off to Australia.

Then Jude gets back into contact with his cousin Sue Bridehead (Kate Winslet), whom he had not seen since they were children. They grow close, but when Jude tells her that he is married, even though he has not seen his wife in years, she leaves him and marries Richard Phillotson (Liam Cunningham), the schoolmaster for whom she has been working, even though she admits she does not love him.

And then things get REALLY complicated.

The story is a tragedy on any number of levels, and I will leave it to you to count them all. No villains, no heroes, but rotten things happening to people you like. Now that I think of it, this is the most depressing of Thomas Hardy's typically depressing stories. Still, it is well done and basically faithful to the book. I can only give it three stars mostly because it is such a very depressing story.",1336694400,,1261,4.566371681415929
845837,5,6304342950,"My reaction is the complete opposite of the Tom Keogh editorial review on this page. This film captured a poignant, fatalistic, bleakly powerful tone better than most films I've seen, especially one that's an adaptation of a literary classic. The film truncated the novel's end, which is ultimately fatal, but left one at an emotional crossroads that seemed the perfect cinematic end to me. What a heartbreaking, emotional sledgehammer of a film! The acting by Christopher Eccleston and Kate Winslet was impeccable. Although the BBC adaptation with Robert Powell is technically more faithful to the novel, it lacks the power of this film. Acting, cinematography, music, editing all coalesce into one of the most affecting literary adaptations I've ever seen. I am baffled (and extremely frustrated) that this film never received the acclaim it got and I wish it were available on DVD in the US. For now, I have to be content with a used VHS for which I paid a high price. What a neglected masterpiece!",1336262400,2,1001,4.964285714285714
845838,1,6304342950,"I can't believe this movie has such a high rating.  If you want to see decent people's lives totally destroyed by making poor decisions, class distinction and religious prejudice, this is the movie for you.  The ending is not bad, it is HORRIBLE.  The most enjoyable part of the movie is Kate Winslet in her birthday suit.  If you are foolish enough to get this movie, stop watching after that scene.

845839,2,6304342950,"Unless i had a duff copy the movie ends in the graveyard with Jude pleading to a departing Sue...then the credits??? For anyone who has read the book they will know that this is not the end of the story by a good margin. For not wanting to be a spoiler I will not reveal anymore. I had my suspicions when I looked at the length of the production but went ahead and bought it anyway. The narrative of Jude,Sue,Phillotson and Arabella, the books main players, needs a much longer time frame.
I also agree with some others that the pig slaughtering scene and the childbirth scene are too graphic. Hardy only mentions the arrival of children in passing comments, other than Father Time.
The book makes a powerful and disturbing but real comment which leaves the reader sad and thoughtful. The movie did not do that so much with me. Other than that the locations of the plots and scenery used are very well done. For the most part the film faithfully follows Hardy's novel apart from what i have stated above.",1325030400,,1004,4.491803278688525
845840,2,6304342950,"A movie of forbidden love between cousins.  I wish I could say I enjoyed the story, but when you watch individuals making pointless choices in life, I often don't find it very entertaining.  I love Kate Winslet.  The woman is brilliant in anything she stars in frankly.  You can see the very young actress in an emotional role.  As far as the story, ""yawn.""  Perhaps I would have found some satisfaction if the man wasn't just driven by his male appetites, but had actually pursued the true love of his life - knowledge. The movie has its deep tragedy that changes everything, but leaves the audience with a sad and raveled ending, which comes to no real conclusion or a lasting theme to make you feel satisfied after the words ""The End.""

845843,3,6304342950,"The level of acting talent in `Jude' certainly helps elevate it from the messy construction and merely serviceable structure of the film.

The story tells of young Jude Fawley, a stone mason who dreams of a big education and a richly fulfilling life.  At a young age he winds up married to a woman named Arabella, but his marriage does not work out (lack of love and a supposed curse on the Fowley men).  Venturing off to discover his dreams, Jude becomes acquainted with his cousin, Sue.  Sue is free spirited and intelligent and controversial and simply everything that a man could hope to adore and so, quickly, Jude becomes smitten.  Despite her marriage to a man whom Jude respects (a former teacher of his), Jude and Sue engage in a illicit affair and soon begin their life together.  They are in love, but they are also stubborn (refusing to condition themselves to society's standards of marriage) and this costs them dearly in the end.

The story itself is a strong one, but the way that it is woven is a little sub par.  The films first half jumps around far too much, presenting Jude as a bit of an unstable individual (one thing goes wrong and it's back home, then he rashly moves out, then back home) who doesn't know himself enough to understand what is good for him.  He is rather unlikable in my opinion, a tad whiney and uncharismatic.  In fact, Sue's husband Phillotson is far more likable and endearing.  I also found the structure of the film to feel a tad like a made for television movie, like one of those BBC films.  If didn't have that grit to it (the film has a little more polish) but it just felt a tad cheap to me in areas.

Where it never fell short though, was the acting.  Even at his whiniest, Christopher Eccleston seemed to understand Jude more than the script did, and his portrayal of him was rather good.  Liam Cunningham was also very well used, as was a ravishing Rachel Griffiths.

But this film BELONGS to Kate Winslet.  As Sue Bridehead, Kate sinks down deep into her soul.  What I love about this performance is that it is very meticulously layered, yet it never feels rehearsed or planned out.  You gradually watch her adapt and grow.  When we meet her she is social and captivating, showing off in bars and debating on Christianity and using her impish sexuality as a tool to be heard.  As she matures and her relationship with Jude grows we see her calm her sensual displays and add the texture of hesitance to her interactions.  The seduction scene in Jude's room is a key moment, where she baits him to make love to her without lifting the air of ambiguity that shields her from a bad decision.  When she marries Phillotson we see the doubt creep in, the nervous understanding that she is making a mistake, and as she toys with her own understanding of her feelings for Jude we see her begin to crumble under the pressure she has heaped upon herself.  We finally get a glimpse of her free spirited nature unleashed once again when she attains Jude as her own, but as desperation and circumstance get a hold of her we see her become frail in her own bitterness.  We almost begin to see a resentment in her eyes, but as she opens the door and takes in the films final moment of horror we see that the resentment building was a realization that her errors were being marked and her sins were catching up with her.

She was bound to be punished.

Hands down, one of the finest performances of the 90's.  Kate Winslet is easily my favorite working actress today (yes, even above the almighty Meryl, and I LOVE ME SOME MERYL STREEP) and this is a prime example as to why.

While this film does not truly deliver on all accounts (it can be stiff, confusing, tedious, redundant and emotionally cold) the performances are more than enough for me to HIGHLY recommend you at least see this once.",1270425600,,3833,4.482708933717579
845844,5,6304342950,"I was stunned, honestly stunned. Its one of the rare films on incestuous relationships and I really, really loved it. The film offers a lot more than just regular stories plucked from the pages of Romantic novels. The purity, the passion, the tension shown between the two characters in the film. A strong chemistry between Kate Winslet and Christopher Eccleston had my eyes glued on the screen, I refused to blink even once while watching, I was so compelled, so overwhelmed by the acting and direction of the film. Its quite an unusual film, but truly a beautiful one, Incestuous relations may not be liked by everyone, but the film is quite an experience, quite a journey.

845845,2,6304342950,"I normally like these kind of movies.  Period picture, forbidden love, obsession.  Has anyone made a movie of Flaubert's SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION?  Oh, well, there's several versions of MADAME BOVARY.  That fascinating train wreck of a love in WUTHERING HEIGHTS.  Something with a stuffy veneer but a destructive burning passion underneath.

Then there's JUDE.

The elements were there and it's terrifically shot and acted but...yikes.  The story just doesn't carry its audience into sympathizing for these lovers.  The ""society"" isn't personified enough to provide a good villain.  A guy who wants to marry his cousin wouldn't fly too well RIGHT NOW, let alone way back in the day.  After so much destructive calamity is inflicted on this couple--and you definitely get the feeling that much more than merely other people and society is against them--even you're ready to throw in the towel on this affair.

If you're the kind of person who wants to only see Kate Winslet naked...you're really going to dislike this movie.  This isn't a Skinna-Max late night romp (NAKED EYES 5 or something), it's not even THE STORY OF O or HENRY AND JUNE, it's a serious adaption of a really old book.  From reading the other reviews, it sounds like they inserted a sex scene that didn't even appear in the novel (I've only read one Hardy novel so far).

Before catastrophe strikes (and a WAY over the top disaster), Jude says that he's ""waiting for the world to change"" to accept living and having children with his cousin as a common-law wife.  After watching JUDE, the world looks like it's ready to come after you if you pull that stuff.",1229212800,3,1624,4.850909090909091

845913,4,6304342950,"Michael Winterbottom who directed ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" & ""Butterfly Kiss"" helmed this project that sank like a stone at the box office.  Thomas Hardy's last novel ""Jude the Obscure"" was so poorly received that he didn't write another.  But the thing about good period piece adaptations is that they remain interesting long after their initial release.  This 1996 film is no different in its DVD release.

As the brooding Jude Fawley Christopher Eccleston who was in ""28 Days Later"" & ""The Others"" with Nicole Kidman does a good job with the many emotional layers of this character.  Born in the lower class, he longed to be educated.  But his hormones cause him to marry Arabella in an ill-fated arrangement.  Then his attraction to his cousin and his dedication to their illicit love are entrancing.

Australian actress Rachel Griffiths from the ""Six Feet Under"" TV series and who was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Hillary & Jackie"" does a good job in the part of Jude's wife Arrabella.  The character in the screenplay seems not well fleshed.  We're not totally sure why the two break off.

Kate Winslett with her 3 Oscar nominations (""Sense & Sensibility,"" ""The Titantic,"" & ""Iris"") is a vivid actress upon whose face a range of emotions and nuances are reflected.  As Jude's cousin Sue, she is a feminist prototype.  We watch her aversion to religion and then her embrace of it after the death of her children in amazement as the actress covers such range.

At Jude's urging, Sue marries schoolteacher Phillotson, but it is a loveless affair.  Liam Cunningham plays Phillotson excellently and delicately.  His affection for Sue is as delightful as it unrequited.

Eduardo Serra did the cinematography as he did for ""Beyond the Sea,"" ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre.""  The look of the film is exquisite and lyrical.

Thomas Hardy's story is hardly the social shocker it was in its day.  However, the violence to the children is so tragic that it leaves the viewer drained and disappointed.  In the end, this is a valuable picture filled with excellent performances and a classic story.  Enjoy!",1130112000,17,2147,4.905555555555556

845916,2,6304342950,"Christopher Eccleston and Kate Winslet star in this grim british drama based on a Thomas Hardy novel. The story focuses the relationship between Jude (played by Eccleston) and his cousin/lover (Kate Winslet). Basically a love-story-gone-wrong, ""Jude"" manages to focus subjects such as incest, knowledge, life choices, ambition and the nature of passion. Director Michael Winterbottom offers an impressive cinematography with many beautiful shots, and the acting is not below excellent and realistic. Unfortunately, the plot never quite works, going back and forth for the most part but in fact never gets anywhere too interesting. There are some good scenes here, mostly due to the convincing acting, but the pacing and plot are too rushed and muddled. The movie also runs longer than it needs to, and a couple of sequences just drag on and on. Although it was promising, ""Jude"" is a missed opportunity and a failed effort that never manages to engage and become something memorable. Poignant and moving at parts, still too cold, dry and distant as a whole.

I'm a feature film editor and have found this film to be one of my favorites.  Although the film doesn't follow Hardy's novel precisely (like almost all films that are based on a novel) the sparse and stark portrayal of the characters is infectiously moving.  It's a very beautiful film with exceptional acting, and I'd recommend it highly to the potential viewer.  If you like ""intense"" films that are not overly dramatized to an unrealistic point, this film is for you.  I'd also recommend Michael Winterbottom's other films.

845973,5,6304342950,"Over one hundred years ago, Thomas Hardy experienced critical backlash against his novel ""Jude the Obscure"" and never wrote another novel. This film version is also controversial, but definitely worth a look.
This stars Christopher Eccleston in the title role as a stonemason who yearns for higher learning and a better life. Eccleston's portrayal of Jude is excellent in that he is no Hollywood pretty boy. His ears are too big and his face sallow, but his expressions and gaunt look help his performance immensely, especially in the latter half of the film. Too bad the audience is left in the dark about what exactly makes his character tick.
Jude's cousin, Sue, is played by Kate Winslet. She brings a professionalism to her role that almost overshadows Eccleston. Every nuance of her work here does not seem calculated, but very natural.
Jude's wife, Arabella, who leaves him, but keeps popping back into his life over and over again, is played by Rachel Griffiths. Her character is a major flaw in the film. Gothicism was fading in the time this novel was written; readers were experiencing more real situations in novels by the likes of Charles Dickens, or fantastic situations in novels by H.G. Wells. Arabella seems old hat in a period film. When she is introduced, the scene is full of sunshine and utopian bliss. Throughout the film, she appears in black widow's wear, striking a contrast against gray backgrounds and the forced happiness of Jude and Sue. This role screamed for a more intense actress along the lines of Nicole Kidman or Emily Watson. Griffiths does not have the presenced needed. Any other actress would have taken the part and sunk her teeth into it, but Griffiths comes across as a pitiful old maid without a thought in her head. In the beginning of the film, in her cutesy courtship with Jude, another actress may have appeared whimsical and innocent, Griffiths plays Arabella like a moron.
The director is well known in British and art house circles. His direction is expert, and different from other adaptations of long English novels. Winterbottom uses filmed captions to let the viewer know where Jude's travels take him. The film opens during Jude's childhood, and Winterbottom shoots the entire sequence in black and white, evoking antiquated romantic memories of childhood. The screenwriter, Hossein Amini, and Winterbottom load the film with too much sex, after a while it almost overshadows the plot and characters. The musical score and set design are marvelous and i would highly recommend this film to others, but maybe not as a study aid for Thomas Hardy-reading high school students. The film has plenty of raw emotion (including the stinging fate of Sue and Jude's children), but Jude's character remains, pardon the pun, obscure. There is something great here, despite the flaws.
This is rated (R) for physical violence, gore, female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, and strong adult situations.",1023235200,3,2947,5.016326530612245
845974,1,6304342950,"If you have a tender heart toward children, then do not watch this film.  All other elements aside, what ultimately happens to the children in this novel made me drop to my knees in front of my television and weep.  When it was over I proceeded to have my worst night of sleep for the year.  True, the character studies are excellent, including that of the oldest child, and the faithfulness to Hardy's vision is sufficient.  There is a gratuitous nude scene involving Kate Winslet that was, nevertheless, nice to have to endure (the nakedness of her character, I suppose, is meant to reflect the nakedness of emotion between the cousins during that moment of their consummation, as well as their naked position in society with regard to social taboo).  Ultimately, however, I do not like graphic depictions of children suffering violence, and I do not recommend this film for that reason.",1010188800,7,889,4.822368421052632
845975,3,6304342950,"Those familiar with the bittersweet, obsessive, compulsive aspect of Thomas Hardy's so-called romantic novels will instantly know that this film is not apt to leave one with a warm fuzzy feeling by the last reel. Certainly it is not recommended that one read the novel, Jude the Obscure, before viewing. How many films have failed to live up to the expectations of the literary adaptation? Why would this be any different? Jude is a man of humble birth who strives to rise above his allotment in life. Rather than approaching the subject as a modern fairy tale where dreams do come true, the standard treatment in cinema, there is a grim realism which reflects the destructive nature of impractical and unnatural compulsions. Jude attempts to fly in the face of social convention in a headlong flight of self-destruction which at times has the horrific fascination of a slow motion train wreck, one is disturbed by the sight but unable to turn away. I knew nothing of this film save that the title characters were played by the extremely talented pair, Kate Winslet and Christopher Eccleston. That was sufficient enticement for me and as always I was not disappointed by the performances. Despite the current trend to degrade the ""Masterpiece Theatre"" production style actors and directors of immense talent breath life into even the dullest works. Dull this film isn't but grim it certainly is. Only a brave director would tackle this kind of project. How much easier it would have been to soften the hard edge to  make the viewing more palatable. There is much to be gleaned from witnessing in all its ugliness the past stigmatization of relationships we now accept as commonplace. If one comes away from this film with nothing more than an inkling of gratitude or awe for the sacrifice of those who attempted to effect social change then this film is worth the viewing.",1009324800,9,1872,4.868338557993731
845976,4,6304342950,"This pessimistic and rather brutal cinematic production is based on the nineteenth century novel Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy.  A bowdlerized and altered version of that novel first appeared in Harper's New Monthly Magazine as a serial beginning in December 1894.  Its original title was ""The Simpletons,"" a title modern viewers of this movie might find appropriate considering how Jude and Sue round out their lives.
It need hardly be said that any motion picture, and certainly not one running only about two hours, can hope to do justice to Hardy's novel (his last, incidentally) which is about 180,000 words long (about 400 pages of dense text).  An earlier TV mini series version made by the BBC that I have not seen, Jude the Obscure (1971), ran for almost four and a half hours in six episodes.  But this is a pretty good movie anyway, highlighted by an enthralling performance by Kate Winslet.
The movie starts rather slowly, if picturesquely, until Kate appears and then the movie comes to life.  I have seen Winslet in several films, including her first feature film when she was18-years-old, Heavenly Creatures (1994), an interesting film made in New Zealand based on a sensational matricide from the 1950s.  She was very good in that film, her budding talent immediately obvious as the spinning, laughing, crazy teen who went off the deep end emotionally.  In Jude, Winslet's sharp, confident and commanding style is given greater range and she comes across with a performance that is full of life, effervescent, delightful, witty, sly, clever, and very expressive, and she looks beautiful doing it.
The story itself, a naturalistic tragedy that in some respects anticipates Theodore Dreiser, et al., was considered immoral in its time.  ""The Bishop of Wakefield, disgusted with the novel's <insolence and indecency>, threw it in the fire,"" according to Terry Eagleton who wrote the Introduction for the New Wessex Edition of the book.  Modern film goers will hardly notice the implied critique of marriage that offended Victorian readers, but they might find the scene where Arabella throws the pig's ""part"" at Jude indelicate.  Victorian readers found that scene most offensive.  As a public service I want to warn any modern viewer who might be offended at seeing Kate Winslet naked to avoid this film.  (Just Joking: Kate is quite fetching in the Rubenesque shot.)  To be honest, though, this really is a tragedy that still has the power to offend some sensibilities.  Certainly you don't want the kids to see it.
Christopher Eccleston plays Jude and does a good job, and Rachel Griffiths in a modest part plays Jude's first wife Arabella.  Director Michael Winterbottom stayed spiritually true to Hardy's dark vision while tailoring the tale for modern audiences.  There's a nice period piece feel and some charming cinematography.  The denouement is well set up and so realistically done that we don't know whether to be horrified or outraged.  I think I was both.",1008460800,17,2986,5.04684317718941

845978,1,6304342950,"If there were, I would give this movie a perfect -10. Not only this movie reduced the novel to three colorful copulations and one as wonderful birth scenes, but it doesn't even stand as a work by its own.
In fact, the person with whom I watched this movie, who didn't happen to read that particular Hardy's novel, couldn't understand of anything what was going on. Just a jumble-mumble of episodes, play with movie color, terrible acting, horiffic character development and so much more that I could write a whole novel, just on how uninventive this movie was.
Thankfully, I don't have too; instead just a pick the original novel by T. Hardy, ""Jude the Obscure"" and you will have the chance to experience the utter tragedy of Jude's life dreams, demonizing Sue, of Phillotson's destroyed life and of the ultimate life's winner: Arabella.
When Hardy's wrote that novel he got such an angered reaction because of its realism and unconventionality, he never wrote any novels again. Let's hope that that the director of this picture will never have a chance to shoot any more movies, but for the different reason: stylized, heartless and cold movies disguised under such a prominent novel could be and should be forgotten.",1001203200,4,1218,4.860576923076923
845979,2,6304342950,"While I realize a filmmaker can't be expected to slavishly follow the original text word for word, most go too far in remaking the characters as they see fit.  ""Jude"" is a good example.  In this version, Sue has been crystalized from a flighty woman ""in love with being loved"" to an opinionated pre-feminist.  Arabella has peeled off several layers of crassness to reveal a pragmatic, self-sufficient person who is simply trying to get by.  Even Aunt Drusilla must have found better living through medication; she's now a basically good-hearted person who cares deeply for her adopted nephew!  After I got past those little changes, I had to take a skeptical look at Jude himself -- with everyone around him now presented in such a sympathetic light, you start wondering, ""What's HIS problem?""
For example, since Arabella's basic lack of compassion is never exposed, one can only wonder why Jude leaves the house as she's butchering the pig:  Is he sickened by the sight of blood?  Is he repulsed by seeing his bride up to her elbows in pig entrails?  In the book version, the issue was that Arabella wanted to prolong the pig's death to make the meat tastier, while Jude insisted on putting the poor creature out of its misery.  In the movie, you might assume he'd thought bacon grew on trees.
Another change from book to film:  ""Jude the Obscure"" was considered scandalous when it was published, but what can shock a jaded '90s audience?  Hmm... *ponder*... Oh, I know!  More sex scenes!  Suffice it to say, if you've ever wondered what Kate Winslet looks like in the buff, you need wonder no more.  As for Christopher Eccleston, a fig leaf would've covered everything we didn't see.  There's a lot more eroticism here than the book called for.  Whether that's a good thing is to be determined by the eye of the beholder.
The ending, like the title, is sharply abbreviated.  Without the book as a reference, you'll be left wondering how things all turned out.
Overall, I thought the movie failed to either remain true to the original or stand on its own merits.",998352000,40,2063,4.717877094972067

This movie takes the major themes of the book -- religion, education, temptation, and man's curious position in this world -- and summarily discards most of them.  It injects ""erotic"" scenes that were absent from the book, plays extremely fast-and-loose with Jude and Arabella's relationship, shreds the characterization (cf. Aunt Drusilla), and just generally makes a muddled mess of things.  Arabella and Sue (sorry, Winslet fans) are terribly miscast, and Eccleston is a doubtful Jude indeed.  From the abridgement of the book's title, which is Hardy's finest and among my favorites, to the choppy scene breaks (admittedly, a flaw of the original novel), this movie just doesn't do the book justice.",993340800,3,772,5.201612903225806

However, lest you think the story will be boring, which it seems to be from its first 20 minutes, wait and see the development of the plot. A young man, Jude Fawley, studies all the time. He wants to go to college, but he falls into lust with a young woman (Rachel Griffiths) and she claims to be pregnant. He marries her and defers his dreams of going to college. She eventually runs off and leaves a letter stating that she was never pregnant. You think this is the last you will see of her, but it isn't. It never is in cases such as these. Jude goes off to college and there is meets Sue. Winslet as Sue is a bright, witty, intelligent and unconventional woman who will not bend to the conventions of society or of the church. Her cousin, Jude, is quite a scholar and falls in love with Sue even before he realises she is his cousin. Eventually they fall in love with each other despite the fact that they know it is wrong to be in love with one's own cousin. Winslet bears two children with Jude, and sometime during all of this, Griffiths returns and gives Jude custody of the child she did indeed bear him. The family is poor but seemingly happy, and they travel around to keep people from finding out their secret (having children out of wedlock with one's own cousin is not looked upon fondly). However, just when things seem to be changing economically, the child Jude had with Griffiths murders the other two children and then hangs himself. Sue turns on Jude and leaves him, spending her life almost exclusively in church, suddenly changing her entire belief system. It is a sad, gripping, and heartbreaking story. Very unpleasant, but the acting, scenery and the believability is all there.",985564800,,1867,4.478005865102639
846070,4,6304342950,"In the tradition of Thomas Hardy, this film challenges core social assumptions.  Specifically, the fact that Jude and Sue are cousins in the pre-modern era forces them to enter the margins of society.  Both Kate Winslet and Christopher Eccleston are superb actors.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, it is a breath of fresh air to see that they did not cast some pretty-boy to play the part of Jude.  With regard to Winslet's performance, this film puts her role in Titanic to shame!  Despite the fact that this film was pretty depressing, it had a lasting and emotional effect on me.

846071,5,6304342950,"Jude is probably the most harrowing and draining films I have ever seen. Not only is the tragic story nearly too much to bear, the direction of Michael Winterbottom guides us through the characters emotions and hardships so that we empathize with them every step of the way, yet he doesn't take too much control. One of the ways he achieves this is by being as inatrusive as possible; he lets the camera capture the images without necessarilly guiding the audience. His style is very objective, showing you the raw emotions of the protagonists and what they go through while being unbiased. It's up to you to figure out if what the characters are doing is wrong or not.  On another note, the acting is the best I've ever seen. I saw this movie before Kate Winslet did Titanic, and I was completely astounded by her talent. Winslet and Christopher Eccleston bare all for us to see. Apparently, during the shoot and after the shoot, Winslet ended up crying to let out all the emotion she had been tapping for the role. Eccleston would be obsessed with running- that was his way of letting the tension go. The fact that they themselves felt so much is an indication of everything they conveyed on the screen. The director may be great, but without these two the movie wouldn't be near to the same quality as it is.  After seeing this movie, I watched as the credits rolled by. I couldn't move. I was mesmerized and drained by what I saw, and for weeks afterward I couldn't stop thinking about this movie. See this movie- own it.

Eccleston and Winslets performances are wonderful, the movie is, to be honest also quite well made, however this will only make me more confused about the story.
You can tell Judes feeling all the time, the depth of his longing, his happiness, and his pain. But who can tell what Sue persists? Her behavior seems brusque, thats what the story would tell us? I feel there was no tragedy between Jude and Sue, if there were, its Judes, and if it were, its a lame one, which sometimes makes you feel its a bit artificial.
But its a pleasure to find out how excellent the performances of those actors are in this movie. I wonder how Winslet is convinced by Sues character during her performance, however she managed.

846140,3,6304342950,"Thomas Hardy was perhaps the most depressingly lyrical of 19th century novelists, Jude the Obscure the novel on which this film is based was his final work of fiction and caused a great controversy when it was published  in 1894. I had the (mis)fortune of studying a few of his peoms in  highschool. The degree of which you appreciate his work depends on how much  you value your happiness.
  Michael Winterbottom's film doesn't shy away  from the grimness of its source material, as a result the film can not be  enjoyed, only admired. The first half of the film doesn't work nearly as  well as the second, it feels like what it is, a large literaly novel  compressed into a series of arbitrary scenes that have trouble following  one another, i.e. long periods of time pass and characters change within  minutes. It is only in the second half, when the film gets oppresively  bleak that it becomes truly absorbing.
  Christopher Eccleston plays Jude  Fawley, a self educated man who wants to be a scholar, but is reduced to a  stonemason(carving stone for us mortals) by the British class system. When  he meets his cousin Sue Whitehead played by Kate Winslet it is love at  first sight, but trouble arises when he reveals that he is married and she  in turn marries another man in a fit of defiance. Eccleston is superb as  Jude, bright and idealistic in the beginning and gradually losing his faith  towards the end, and in turn Winslet gives one of her many terrific  performances. There are clear arcs which their characters follow, her  feminist Sue being broken by an unforgiving society/god/religion and his  Jude similarly disheartened.
  Jude actually has the exact same theme as  Graham Greene's The End of The Affair which was adapted into a masterful  film by Neil Jordan. Both accuse God (or the belief in him) of being  vicious to the free spirited. But Jude doesn't have the poetic flow of that  film.
  The much talked about (at least among my classmates) sex scenes  are not the titilation they are in most hollywood films. The sex here is  bare and filled with mournful guilt and is therefore genuinely erotic.  Winterbottom documents everything with graphic attention to detail, he  gives us gutted pigs, rabbits with broken necks and lots of cold sweat. You  can smell this film.
  Hossein Amini who adapted Hardy's book also  adapted The Wings of The Dove. I prefer Jude to that film because it is  more emotionaly stirring. But most of the emotions it stirs are not  pleasant ones. This might sound strange but I admired how relentless this  film is, its a change from most of the studio movies we normally see,  perhaps I can call it ""refreshingly grim"" if there is such a  thing.",958435200,5,2705,4.710300429184549
846141,5,6304342950,"In this 1996 adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel, Jude the Obscure, a sad, archetypal story plays itself out across the rainy English landscape, helped along by brilliant acting and directing alike.
Though the film is  admittedly incredibly bleak, and the ending sad beyond words, it is  all-told a brilliant, classic film.
After a short opening sequence  introducing us to the young Jude, the viewer is quickly drawn into the  parameters of Jude's adult world. Almost at once, we begin to feel his  pain, his longing, his hope, and his persistence. We understand well what  is driving him in his journey through life. This is a novel brought to  life, a story in motion.
As a die-hard fan of Kate Winslet, I have to say  that this film one of my Winslet favorites. In my view, 1997's blockbuster  Titanic was not only a success as a box office triumph or well-loved film  in its own right, but also because it opened the world's eyes to the talent  of this young British actress, whose consistently fine performances and  willingness to break through barriers as an actress have brought the world  great joy on the silver screen, and will surely continue to do so well into  the new millenium.  In Jude, Winslet is charismatic and beautiful (as  usual), and plays Sue Brideheard to a tee. Introduced to her in a small,  well-loved photograph, we soon come to understand what Jude sees in her.  Her beauty, her intelligence, her promise of a better life. Her laughter  still echoes in my head, like the flashbacks in the film. She is youth, she  is carefree, she is unattainable, she is a vision, a memory,  love.
Eccleston is perfect for the role of the ever-yearning Jude, his  face a landscape of green hills, rain, cobblestone streets and stone  carvings, and green hills yet again. There are shadows in his eyes, in his  face. The depth of his feelings is well-conveyed. His tall frame is so  strong and able in one way, so thin and aching in another. We walk with  him, cry with him, and love him as we must love ourselves when fate comes  crashing down upon us.
P.S. This was my introduction to British actress  Rachel Griffiths, who went on to star in Hilary and Jackie, and is  currently starring in Me, Myself, and I. Although her role is smaller than  Eccleston's and Winslet's, and her character perhaps less likable, she also  does a fine job.",957744000,38,2355,4.656934306569343

It's  about a man (Eccleston) who tries to follow his dreams, only to have them  crushed by an unforgiving society; but on another level it's more about the  love he feels for his cousin (Winslet), and the ultimate hopelessness of  their relationship. I read the book before I saw the movie: I felt as  though, three-quarters of the way through, without warning, someone had  punched me in the gut, and then repeatedly kicked me until I died.  Actually, the movie ends with more hope than the book, and that's really  saying something. Think about the storyline this way: imagine the worst  possible life that fate could lay out for you, and then multiple the pain  factor by ten.
