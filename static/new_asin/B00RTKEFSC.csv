6934433,4,B00RTKEFSC,"The battle of Gallipoli has been woven deeply into Australias historical identity and The Water Diviner takes a unique look at life and loss shortly after the conclusion of World War I. Beginning in rural Australia the epic adventure narrative follows Joshua Connors (Russell Crowe) search for his three missing sons presumed killed at Gallipoli. The plot also examines a destabilised Turkey as part of the losing powers of WWI under British occupation rule. Connors persistence and exceptional paternal instincts give him the strength to seek closure on the battlefield itself, yet once in Turkey he sees a side to the local people he does not expect, and through them he gains the opportunity to move forward with his life in unexpected ways.

6934442,3,B00RTKEFSC,"Disappointing story that was much hyped. All the elements were there for a great movie. Scenery, casting, plot, historical significance. But the drama misses the mark as the female lead had no flaw, the child is completely unbelievable and the chemistry between the characters is non existent.

6934459,4,B00RTKEFSC,"This movie got criticism because it glossed over the Armenian genocide and had a rather negative depiction of the Greeks and other groups fighting within and expanding into the Ottoman Empire in the wake of WWI. But to me, that's justified in the stories narrative. This movie is not ultimately about nationalism, despite the depictions of the secret Turkish meetings after the war and at the start of the war when Crowe's son's all answer the call to empire and enlist in the Light Horse. It's about man and his search for meaning and closure after a catastrophe. Crowe goes to Gallipoli to look for his sons remains after the war. And in doing so he finds romance with the widow of an Ottoman soldier and friendship with the officer commanding the opposing trench his sons attacked and where they were last seen. It's a truly good film. A testament to all them men that died in the forgotten war on all sides.",1497312000,5,911,4.595092024539877

6934485,5,B00RTKEFSC,"One of my all time favorite movies. It got to my soul and their story remains there. Every scene held me captivated intensely. A wonderful story of wartime in Turkey when Australia sent their men to fight for a cause and lost many of these men to battle, which in turn left families on both sides broken forever. I liked Russel Crowe before watching this movie, but now I am in awe with his portrayal of the father of these boys, the beloved husband of their Mother & the lover of this fine Turkish woman. All of the actors unfolded their characters in such fine portrayal of the story through.  I hold them all in the deepest respect for bringing such a world class movie to all of the rest of humanity.",1485475200,,704,4.333333333333333

6934496,3,B00RTKEFSC,"Good.  There was so much more to be done with the issue of the destruction of the Turkish Ottomon Empire in those years, but the screenwriters didn't do their homework.  What they did get right is the profound devasation of war upon both sides.  You have to be willing to make a few leaps of faith when they skip through the bullets to get the happy ending, but it's worth watching.",1481760000,,382,4.352112676056338
6934497,5,B00RTKEFSC,"I think Mr Crowe did a wonderful job his first time in the directors chair. This is a beautiful story of love and war. All sorts of love, love of a father for his sons, sons for a father, sons for a mother, mother for her sons or son, man and woman, soldiers for their brothers in arms, patriots for their country, humans for each other, man for his wife, All this and it's not a sappy chick flick. It got intrigue, mystery, adventure, action, war and a dog. Wow! Yet some people didn't like it. Well I guess you can't please everyone. But this is a good damn movie and I am sure we will see more from the writer and also from the new director. So give it a chance I don't think you will be disappointed.

6934511,4,B00RTKEFSC,"An interesting, well-acted movie directed by and starring Russell Crowe.  The story is set in 1919, four years after the bloody and senseless Battle of Gallipoli, in which 45,000 Allied troops (UK, Australia, New Zealand, France and India) and 87,000 Turks were killed.  The story centers around an Australian rancher (Crowe) who travels to far-away Gallipoli to search for the bodies of his three sons, all presumed to have been killed in the battle.  With the help of a sympathetic Turkish officer, who had participated in the 1915 battle and recalled the events and locations of the fateful day the boys perished, Crowe is able to find the remains of two of his three sons.  The Turkish officer then tells Crowe that his third son was not killed in the battle and was transported to a Turkish POW camp, his fate unknown.  The rest of the movie focuses on their attempt to locate the third son, or his remains.  The movie is reminiscent of the 1981 Peter Weir film, ""Gallipoli"", starring Mel Gibson.  In fact, the lads in both movies were members of the 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade, which was the unit involved in the ill-advised ""Charge at the Nek"" on 7 August 1915,  Very few Australians survived the series of charges from their trenches across open ground to the Turkish line, which was fortified by numerous machine gun nests.  To this day, many Australians blame the British officers in charge of the Gallipoli campaign for sending so many young Australians and New Zealanders to their death by ordering suicidal charges at The Nek and other places along the front lines.  Unlike ""Gallipoli"", very little of this movie is devoted to the actual battle; rather, the battle scenes are portrayed in a series of flashbacks that Russell Crowe experiences by reading the diary of one of his sons.  He can somehow conjure up visions of what happened by reading his son's diary entries  That may be a believability issue for many watching this movie.  Also, the semi-love interest between Crowe and a Turkish innkeeper is somewhat interesting but superfluous to the story, IMO.  The DVD is of good quality and is presented in a ""Letterbox"" widescreen format.",1476662400,,2164,4.845108695652174
6934512,4,B00RTKEFSC,"Pretty good. Kind of long for what you get, but it has a happy ending, which these days is pretty rare.",1475107200,,103,3.9523809523809526

6934521,5,B00RTKEFSC,"Not a Russell Crowe fan.  Am a Middle East Studies scholar.  That's the perspective I brought to watching this film.  I have now watched it on big screen and at home. . . perhaps half a dozen times.  This film gets it right... from its portrayal of the horrors of Gallipoli for both sides. . .to the Turkish commander's reminding the Aussie that ""you invaded us"" . . . to the western culture's thinking Tales of the Arabian Nights is beloved literature (it is/was in the west) only to be told by our Turkish female lead ""we have other books"" (what an astonishing quiet nuanced reference to something actually quite deep) . . .  to our ""diviner's"" closeness to the natural world inviting another way of ""knowing"" (akin to the Sufi life he finds in the Ottoman world). I invited a group of friends - from Australia and New Zealand - to get their take on the film before I went public with my own recommendation (people have a right to speak for themselves). Over Turkish coffee and mint tea, we watched and talked and the was consensus that this film is a treasure!

Google ""ANZAC Day"" and discover why April 24, 1915 (100th anniversary saw the release of this film, last April 24) is a really big day of commemoration/remembrance in both Australia and New Zealand.",1472342400,,1263,4.541850220264317

6934532,5,B00RTKEFSC,"Based on a true story, this follows a father searching for his three sons remains after the battle of Galippoli during WWI. Russell Crowe underplays the part with great emotion, loss, and determination that has you engulfed in the trials and tribulations of trying to find information about his sons in a not too friendly environment. His pursuit of the truth finds unusual allies in a Turkish commander, for all intents and purposes may have been responsible for the boys deaths. A young boy befriends Crowe which develops into a much needed relationship for both. Without saying anymore, I urge you to see this little sleeper of a movie, which by the way Russell Crowe directed. I don't think you will be disappointed and will think it was one of the best movies you have seen in years.",1466985600,,788,4.717391304347826

6934580,4,B00RTKEFSC,"Its not uncommon for an actor to decide one day that they want to step out from in front of the camera and get behind it, especially when that said actor has had a very long and rewarding career working alongside inspiring and talented directors.  Warren Beatty, Kevin Costner, Ben Affleck, Angelina Jolie, Robert Redford; those are just a few names.  Recently even Scarlett Johansson picked up a project for her directorial debut.  Last year Russell Crowe made news when he landed on a very inspirational project for his directorial debut; The Water Diviner.  This true story of an Australian man who travels to Turkey to find the bodies of his dead sons and give them a proper burial was ripe for cinematic adaptation, and Russell Crowe was ready and willing to get into the heart of this story.  Having worked alongside such varied directors as Michael Mann, Ron Howard, Darren Aronofsky and Ridley Scott, Crowe has had the experience needed to try his hand at directing his own feature.

The question that remains is; how did he do?

The Water Diviner is a very good film that succeeds in providing an engaging and thought provoking story that is handsomely mounted and expertly acted.  On many accounts, Crowe delivers to his audience a film that is going to leave an impression that is going to linger in their minds.  The film is flawed, and Crowes inexperience behind the camera is shown in some of his narrative choices.  I blame aspects of the script for these glitches in the flow of the film, to be honest, for certain aspects of the plot progression feels uneven.  This is partly due to the fact that the film tries to add unnecessary layers in a condensed time frame.  Running under two hours, the film just doesnt have enough space within it to support the multiple themes this is trying to juggle.

I love Olga Kurylenjos performance and she is something truly splendid to look at, but the love story that is developed between Ayshe and Connor detracts from the films second half and proves to be The Water Diviners largest flaw.

The first half of The Water Diviner is rather perfect.  The way that Connors journey is grounded and expounded upon is beautifully detailed and heartfelt.  There is the right amount of sentiment inserted into every frame, with a true sense of honest restraint, which helps us to completely connect with this mans determination to bring his sons home.  The way that Crowe unearths Connor is something truly beautiful to witness.  There is a point within the films first half where a man (Ayshes father) says that he could see Connors story in his eyes.  This has always been the thing about Crowe that drew me to him as an actor; his eyes say so much.  His eyes carry the weight of his characters story, and here he is weighted down by the aching loss of his family and the guilt of parental failure.  Hes heartbreaking.  The way that the story builds on the rich human understanding from both sides of the battle, as Major Hasan (beautifully portrayed by Yilmaz Erdogan) finds a personal connection to Connor and attempts to help him find his children is rather remarkable.  That was one thing I really appreciated about the film.  There is a real balance here in the way that it portrays mankind in general in the wake of war.  There are no political prejudices, no sides taken.  War has cost MANY their lives and MANY mothers their sons, wives their husbands, fathers their families and so the devastating effects of war are seen as a universal theme and not a singular one.  For this I comment Crowe.

The second half of the film is where things get a little shaky.  This is not to say that the film loses its ability to engage and entertain, because it remains wholly consuming, but there isn't enough time to develop the love story without making it feel oddly cheap and so the film either needed to add another half hour to character development or just strip the whole idea from the film.

There are moments where you can see Crowe meshing the influences of his previous directors into his style, which provides for a beautifully looking film that, in moments, feels tonally conflicting.  He tries to deliver a sharp character portrait, much like something Michael Mann would develop, while inserting the action/adventure tendencies that lie within someone like Ridley Scott and giving us a manipulative romantic center that Ron Howard would develop.  These aspects, on their own, are beautiful, but together prove to pick at the films consistency.

There is real promise here, but he needs time to work out his own vision.

At the heart of The Water Diviner is a story of family, loss, guilt, hope and eventual redemption, and in that light the film is hard to shake.  There are so many moments here that are spellbinding, sometimes for very different reasons (Ill never get the sand storm out of my mind, or the sound of a particular soldier bleeding out).  The way that the flashback scenes of the war are given a real grit, even visually, lends itself to an understanding that this war was violent, relentless and heartless, inhuman.  It serves as a perfect contrast to the rest of the films gloriously beautiful framing.  The score, cinematography and acting are all superb, with Crowe delivering a perfectly brooding portrayal of parental desperation, tapping into his Gladiator side with such ease.  The rest of the cast is uniformly wonderful, with Erdogan being a real standout, and the young Dylan Georgiades stealing many scenes as Ayshes wide-eyed son Orhan.

The Water Diviner is not perfect.  It is flawed.  BUT, it is not without much merit and it tells a very important story in a way that will affect your heart.",1454803200,,5683,4.727918781725888

6934593,1,B00RTKEFSC,"This movie is work of historical fiction, ostensibly about an Australian fathers quest to find the remains of his sons who were killed fighting on behalf of Great Britain in the WWI Battle of Gallipoli.  However, after watching the film, it felt as if it was more a work of history transformed into fiction rather than being fiction inspired by historical events.

Understandable Reticence about the War

From my American perspective, the Battle of Gallipoli is to Australians and New Zealanders (ANZUS) what Vietnam is to Americans but also a source of national awakening.  In looking at the troops assembled at Gallipoli for the Allies, many were members of the British Commonwealth: from Canada, occupied Ireland, and these far flung relations, Australia and New Zealand.  Based upon this tenuous relationship to England, these ANZUS, men from literally half a world away, fought a European war for the benefit of the British Empire.

With that perspective, the films portrayal of ranking British officers as being generally unconcerned with Crowes quest rings true.  Given the horrific loss of life among a much smaller population, such callousness is unforgivable and likely contributes to the pain of the ANZUS involvement in the war.  Indeed, notwithstanding American naivete that we were fighting to save democracy, WWI was not a good war.  Both the Allies we joined, Britain, France and Russia, and the nations they fought, Germany Austro-Hungary and the Ottomans were empires fighting to expand or maintain their empires at the expense of the others.  Hence, this was not a war for freedom; it was a war of imperial expansion.  For that reason, with the benefit of historical hindsight, Australians and New Zealanders clearly remain conflicted about their involvement in the war.

History Gone Wrong

But, that is not the reason for this review.  Crowe would have been a fine representative of the collective angst and confusion Australians and New Zealanders felt in the wake of the war.  Likewise, Olga Kurylenko, who one could imagine was just another Bond girl, offers a good performance, as do those who portray the former Turkish enemies, Yilmaz Erdogan and Cem Yilmaz.  Unfortunately, the effort to humanize those characters and to have an antagonist in the film, Crowe transforms one of the oppressed peoples of the Ottoman Empire, the Greeks, into savage caricatures reminiscent of ISIS.

The film conveniently forgets that empires become empires by conquering and subjugating the nations they conquer.  Specifically, the Ottoman Empire was an empire that, after a centuries long campaign, conquered the Byzantines, a multicultural empire of Greek oriented Christians in what is now the Middle east.  Put differently, the Ottomans, inspired by Islam, were the final conquerors in a 700 year war to defeat the Christian power that barred their way to Europe.  It was from the launch pad of the former Greek capital of Constantinople that, barely a 100 years later, the Turkish Empire threatened all of Europe, only to be thwarted at the gates of Vienna.  One need only ask the Armenians, Assyrians and the Kurds how sympathetic the Turkish authorities are to those to differ in ethnicity or religion.

Thus, it is both lazy and unforgiveable to portray the Greeks in such a manner.  I was forced to wry laughter when the movie attempted to subtly manipulate the audience with scenes of Turkish nationals peacefully protesting the temporary British occupation of Constantinople, whereas those who have been occupied for far longer, the Greeks, were terrorist killers.  (Note: The Allied occupation of Constantinople lasted 5 years.  The Turkish occupation of Constantinople has lasted about 563 years and continues to this day.)  Another scene has a Turkish boy showing Crowe the Hagia Sophia and asking if there is something like that in his homeland.  Crowe correctly answers there is not, but the scene implies that the beautiful mosque was raised by the Ottomans when, in reality, it had been constructed as a Greek Orthodox cathedral in 537 by the Emperor Justinian (Christian) and was converted to a mosque in 1453 only after the storming of Constantinople.

Illumination versus Sublimation

Because discourse is now so polarized, I will make the necessary disclaimer that is no racist or religious screed.  WWI was not a religious war.  In reality, the motivations of the British and Ottomans were no different than the first caveman clans who discovered a good hunting ground: one of them wanted to keep and maybe get more, the other one wanted to take it away.  More importantly, as my father, a combat veteran from WWII through Vietnam explained, the rank-and-file frontline soldier, after the shooting is done and you learn about the man you captured, is a simple person not much different than yourself.  Just like you, he is a man caught up in events beyond his control, trying to survive.  In the end, it is the government that directs, not the man that directed, who is at fault.  For that reason, had the movie been one of two men of different religions, of different races and different nations finding a shared regret for what distant governments made them do, it would have been a more powerful movie.

Likewise, I am not an apologist.  Anglo-French imperial aims in dismembering the Middle East are likely one of the root causes the chaos and violence we see today in the Levant.  (If you must watch movies about history rather than read about it, the classic movie Lawrence of Arabia can fill you in on this aspect of history) The ascent of the Soviet Union and international Communism, Nazism, World War II and the Cold War were all linked to this war.  But, by the same token, we cannot whitewash the grim reality that if there was Greek anger, it was not simply a result of a 500 year old loss in war.  As was confirmed in 2007 by the International Association of Genocide Scholars, from 1914-1920 the Greeks were victims of what is called the Pontic Genocide, wherein the Ottoman government was found to have engaged in the ethnic cleansing nearly 100,000 Greeks from Turkish lands and, as part of a peace settlement with Greece, had many of the survivors were expelled.  (The early chapters of Giles Miltons work, The Riddle and the Knight, recounts how Turkish authorities are still seeking to erase the Greek presence from Istanbul.)  That being said, Crowe could have tempered the false impressions by stating something about the conduct of the Turkish government towards the Greeks.  It is interesting, therefore, at the end of this movie, as the movie gives facts about the events shown, that he chose not to do so.

History is best when it offers a unified view of human nature, conflicts and events.  Movies, by their nature, cannot endeavor to such standards.  Notwithstanding, I do not believe it is a mere quibble to ignore a genocide that was occurring simultaneously to the events in the film.  Moviemakers are well aware that how a movie depicts events can set in place the audiences view of a historical event, especially where the history is virtually untaught except at the collegiate level to history majors.  Moreover, putting events in context help audiences to understand the causes of modern day crises.  Case in point, this movies the backdrop of WWI, even though it almost a century in the past, would actually serve to inform us about Turkish involvement in the modern day Syrian Civil War and its conflict with Russia.

It is for those reasons that, if you chose to portray history, one does not fictionalize uncomfortable facts.  Thus, while I believe the waste of life occasioned by the British and Ottoman Empires forcing their citizens to fight for purely imperial gain is a worthy topic, to discredit the human tragedy suffered by those the Ottoman rulers oppressed with a caricature untethered to any reality is equally offensive.",1453939200,3,7904,5.0

The father goes on a quest to try to recover the bodies of his dead sons (something his wife wanted him to do) so that he can bring them home and bury them with their mom. in attempting to do this he gets zero help from the British institutions/officers in charge at the time, and some of those officers aren't portrayed flatteringly in the film (the film got a week long release in England, after which it was no longer shown. don't know if that was due to poor portrayal of English authorities, but according to Wikipedia, the film got a week long release and then stopped being shown in England). Russell Crowe, aided by other characters, is able to locate the bodies of two of his sons and also one of his sons is alive and is located and they leave apparently to return to their farm, though the film doesn't actually show them there.

6934618,5,B00RTKEFSC,"This is a superb suspenseful romantic heart-felt film, with very good acting depicting a well-told story. It is 1915 in the beginning of World War I. The lied forces fought at Gallipoli against the Turks. 8709 Australians died in the battle and 19,441 were wounded. An Australian man - Crowe, who directed the film - is a farmer with a skill to find water using a rod. Four years after the war, three of his sons, his only sons, went to the Gallipoli battle and did not return. Crowe's wife berated him: If you can find water you can find our sons. She continued in this manner for some time, and then committed suicide. Crowe decides to go and find his sons and, if they are dead, bring their bodies home to lie beside his wife.

The English do not want Crowe in Turkey. They do not see how he could find the bodies, most of which were buried in mass graves together with dead horses. The Turks also do not like him because he is an Australian and the Australians killed many of their people during the war. He is led - literally - to a boarding house where there is a beautiful woman who has lost her husband, a Turk, and believes he is still alive. In the house is the husband's brother who wants to marry the beautiful woman. This brother sees that she is attracted to Crowe.

The film tells about Crowe's difficulties, about the help that one Turk gives him despite the objections of the English, the Turk's battle at that time with the Greeks, what happened to the sons, and what happens between Crowe and the woman and her suitor.",1452038400,,1537,4.370629370629371

6934622,4,B00RTKEFSC,A subtle war-drama/time piece set in the post-Great War Ottoman Empire (present day Turkey) taking place during the events leading to Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922).  Russell Crowe plays an Australian father of three sons who went missing after the Gallipoli Campaign.  He sets out to find-out if his sons are dead or alive but imprisoned.  Once in Turkey he rents a room in bad-and-breakfast type of place run by a single mother (played by Olga Kurylenk) of a young boy whose father went also missing during the war...,1451433600,,518,4.931034482758621

This is a movie with a message, two actually. One is that enemies can become great friends, that we're all just people doing what we're expected to do and if you look past what a man does into what the man IS, you might actually like him.

Two, never give up. Belief is a powerful motivator and sometimes the result will surprise you.",1451433600,,550,4.278846153846154

6934655,4,B00RTKEFSC,"The  film provides a  curious  look  at  Gallipoli.  Long considered  a  special  defining  event  for  Australia  and  New  Zealand  during  WW1.  Those  who recall  Peter  Weir's  Gallipoli  will  find  odd  comparisons  here.  That  film  featured a  young Mel  Gibson  and  this  one  features  an  aging  Russell  Crowe  both  as  star  and  director.  Same  subject,  radically  different  take.

I  will  not  bother  to  recap  the  plot  as  that  has  been  done  numerous  times  already.  I  will try  instead  to  explain  some  of  the  complex  history  this  film  breezes  over.  ANZACs  were  the  Australian  New  Zealand  Army  Corps  that were  raised  as  part  of  the  Dominion  forces  of  the  British  Empire  for  service  during The  Great  War  or  WW1.  They were  eager  to do  their  bit  for  King &  Country  and were  not  forced  or  coerced  by  Britain  to  do  so.  Note  today  how  both  still  have  the  Queen  as  part  of  their  goverment.

The  ANZAC  Corps  formed  part  of  the Gallipoli  expedition  that was  sent  up  the  Dardenelles  under  the  uninspired  leadership  of  Sir  Ian  Hamilton,  an  aged  Victorian  soldier  who  was  way  over  his  head  with  such a  complex  mission.  The  Gallipoli  Campaign  was  the  brainchild  of  Winston  Churchill  of  WW2  fame, then  head  of  the  Admiralty  in  Britain.  The  Ottoman  Empire  had  recently  entered the  First  World  War  on  the  side  of  the  Central  Powers,  or  Germany  and  Austria.  This  happened  more  by  accident  than  intent,  but  that's  another  whole  story  worthy  of a  movie  in  itself!  Suffice  to  say  that  with  Russia  part  of  the  the  Allies  there  was  plenty  of  bad  blood  going  back  decades  with  Turkey.  Look  at  events  today  for  example!  Although  neutral  at  the  outbreak  of  the war,  The  Ottomans  were bound  to  get  sucked  in  just  like  everyone  else.

Churchill's  ambitious  plan was  to send  an  Allied  expedition  up  the  Dardenelle  Straits  via  Gallipoli  straight  to  Istenbul. This  would  knock  Turkey quickly  out  of  the  war  in  1915,  and  then help  Russia  in  its  struggle  against  the  Central  Powers.  The  plan  looked  great  on  paper,  but  in  reality  such a  large,  modern  amphibious  operation  involving  thousands  of  Allied  troops  and  hundreds  of  vessels  had  not  been  undertaken.  Coordination  and  cooperation  between  naval  and  land  forces  were  in  their  infancy.  Mistakes  were  made.  Tragic  mistakes,  and  opportunities  were  lost.  The  Allies  were  soon  bogged  down  in  the  Gallipoli  Peninsular  stuck in  static trench  warfare.  Just  like  the  Western  Front  in  France.

The  ANZACs  were  merely a  part  of  this  expedition.  They  landed  at  their  own  beach and  suffered  heavy  losses just  like  all  the  other Commonwealth and  British  forces.  The  Turks  suffered  huge  losses  trying  to  drive  them  out.  The  Battle  of  Long  Pine  where  the  Russell  Crowe  character  had  his  three  sons  die  was  one  of  the  many  desperate  attempts  the  ANZACs  made  to try  and  break  out  of  the  beachhead.  They  never  did.  The  British  and  Turks  suffered  over  200,000  casualties  in  the  nearly  8  months  of  fighting.  Eventually  the  Allies  gave  up  the  attempt  and  retired.  Churchill was  broken  politically and  would  never  recover  his  career  until  WW2  as  Prime  Minster.
This  film,  like  the earlier  Gallipoli  movie has  to  have  its  bit  of  anti-British  Imperialism  where  British  officers  are  made  to  always  look  arrogant  and  stupid!  This  seems a  film  requirement  now.  In  reality  this  was  not  how  it  actually  was.

Although  Turkey  won the  Gallipoli  Campaign,  they  would  lose  the  war.  The  Russell  Crowe  character  finds  himself  in  the  Anitolia  outback  with  the  Turkish  major  in  the  post  war  period.  Greece  had  been coerced  into  supporting  the  Allied  effort  in  the  Balkans  during  the  war.  The  Greek  Army  however  had  done  little  actual  fighting.  When  the  Ottoman  Empire  collapsed  in  1918  they  saw  this  as  an  opportunity  to  invade  and  claim a  greater  Greece  in  the  Levant  and Turkey.  Britain  more  or  less  looked  the  other  way.  After  all  Greece  had  been an  ally,  albeit  a  reluctant  one.  The  War  in  Turkey  with  Greece  in  1919-20  had  all  the  elements  of  Ethnic  Cleansing  we  have  come  to  expect in  that  region. The  film  does  not  show  the  Greeks  in  a pretty  light,  and  Americans  of  Greek  heritage  will  no  doubt  NOT  like  this  take  on  the  history!  The  fact  is  however  when  the  Greeks  invaded  they  massacured Turks,  when the  Turks  rallied  under  Mustpha  Kamel.  soon  to  be  known  as  Attuturk  they  massacured the  Greeks  in  turn!  The  subsequent massive  Greek defeat  would  see  the  founding  of  the  modern  Turkish  nation under  Attuturk,  a  Founding Father  figure  in  his  own  right.  Turkey  today  is  still  ruled  under  his  Westernizing  legacy,  although  there  have  been  recent  signs  some  Islamic  erosion!

So  the  Russell  Crowe  film  covers  a  lot  of  complex history with  just a  father  searching  for  his  three  lost  ANZAC  sons. As usual  the  history  is a  lot  more  involved  than  most  films  of  this  nature  want to get into.  Still,  having  some historical reference  helps  in  understanding a film  that  covers  a lot  of  significant  events  in  its  passing.  ANZAC  Day  remains  an  important  National  Holiday  Down  Under  just  like  Memorial  &  Veterans  Days  here  in  the  States.  This  film  will speak  most  clearly  to  that audience  Down  Under.  For  the  rest  of  us a  little  History  lesson  is  required  to  get  a  better  understanding.  I  hope  I  have  helped  in  some  small  way.",1448668800,4,5988,4.766741071428571

He and his wife have three sons. As they grow up, they want to fight in Battle of Gallipoli. He reluctantly sends them off charging the oldest one with taking care of the two younger ones. The three brothers manage to never be apart during the battles. However, all three of them are horribly wounded in one particular battle. Only the older brother survives and he feels such guilt that he stays in Turkey and makes no attempt to contact his mother and father back in Australia. After not hearing from their children for three years, Russell Crowe's wife has lost he rmind and thinks or pretends the three sons are still there and are still young and sends Russell into the boys' bedroom to read them goodnight stories. She polishes their shoes. Finally she has a complete breakdown and kills herself. At this point, Russell Crowe's character makes a promise to his dead wife that he will find his boys and bring them home.

6934668,4,B00RTKEFSC,"What a visually stunning movie! Not just for the beautiful natural scenery, but all the ugly things are captured in a visceral way as well. This movie makes you feel things as well as witness them.

The story is about an Australian farmer whose boys died in the war four years ago. His grieving wife can neither forget it nor forgive her husband for allowing them to go. She wants them to be buried at home. The rest of the movie is about the farmer's quest to Turkey to fulfill that desire. (I don't want to give it away).

The movie has love, culture clashes, war, family, injustice, oppression, and many elements that tug at the heart strings. There are some implausibilities in the story that seem to be inserted to make it more of a Hollywood story. If you can get past that part. It's quite good. The cast is quite good and the 111 minutes go by quickly.

There is no sex or nudity. There is some blood and fighting, but it's not gratuitous or graphic.",1448150400,,958,4.370786516853933

6934733,4,B00RTKEFSC,"This movie caught me by surprise.  My expectation was that I would find this movie corn-ball and uninteresting, but quite the contrary, it captured me from start to finish.  I was surprised at how much I liked Russell Crowe's interpretation of this role of a father in search of his sons.  It was moving and believable.  Also, I think it is an important story to have the history of the Australian role in WW-I and the burden it carried on the Australian People.  I think that's why Russell Crowe chose to direct this movie in addition to leading it.  I think that doing this can be a land mine for some actor creating over-emotive roles, but rather I think Crowe pulls it off.  There is a role of a young boy in this, and often times the writers can really drop the ball on foreign young boy roles, but this young actor did a great job, and I liked the writers choice to keep the conversation between the boy and his mother in Turkish.  Also, the second theme of friendship among fathers who are on the same page ethically, while their cultures may not be was fresh. I also think this film is a strong family movie that tells how family's cope with loss.  Yes, watch this movie with your kids.",1445817600,,1194,4.366515837104072

6934770,4,B00RTKEFSC,"Russell Crowe makes his directorial debut in this historical drama, inspired by true events.  He also stars as Joshua Conner, an Australian who has raised 3 sons, all sent to war, ""for King and Country"" in 1914.  The three stayed together and ended up in the infamous battle against the Ottoman Empire in what they called Gallipoli in modern day Turkey.  The sons never returned, presumed dead along with thousands of others in the fierce campaign.  Conners wife (Jacqueline McKenzie) was never the same, eventually committing suicide.  Conner had promised her, he would find the boys and return them home.  With little else to do, he sells everything and heads for Turkey in 1919.

Now controlled by the British, Conner is refused entry to the battle site where Lt. Col. Hughes (Jai Courney) is excavating the bodies of the soldiers who died there and identifying their remains.  Conner, somehow has a blood-stained diary sent to him by his oldest son, Art (Ryan Corr) which depicts the area and scene.  Conner, given his ability to locate water (diviner) back home concludes those skills and his somewhat magical dreams will allow him to find his boys.  He eventually circumnavigates his way to the site and Hughes allows him to stay.  With the help of a couple of Turkish soldiers, Maj. Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan) and Sgt. Jemal (Cem Yilmaz) who fought in the battle, Conner finds the remains of his 2 youngest sons (dog tags).

Returning to Istanbul where he originally stayed, Conner develops a plan to find Art, who may or may not be still alive.  In a secondary plot line, Conner strikes up a relationship with Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) and her young son, Orhan (Dylan Georgiades).  She runs the hotel with her brother-in-law having lost her husband in the war.  Conner, originally unwelcome as an outsider eventually cozies up to Ayshe and Hasan and Jemal who help him track down Arthur.  Crowes rookie film is very good, sideswiped on occasion by some cheesy dialog.  But the film is beautifully shot and has some seemingly authentic battle sequences including a heart wrenching scene as the 3 sons lie wounded.  As a father of 3 sons myself, I suspect this film affected me more than some.  Recommended.",1444867200,,2206,4.850267379679145

I wish that there would have been more explanation of him divining and subsequently finding his water etc  but alas they did not do that.

They walked into the hotel with new clothes despite the fact that the father had been robbed/or lost his money, etc.  Many overlooked details that would not have happened in real life, i.e., no documents but still traveling.

His mission was successful even though it was hampered  by several misfortunes stemming from some conflict in Turkey at the time. Not sure how this movie would have been improved but the end result was a direct for tv one, which is not what you'd expect from someone like Crowe. Although ...",1443830400,,601,4.463636363636364

The Water Diviner and Russell Crowe shows us that we are more than hate, when we open ourselves up to what gives us life we just might have a chance at living.

We should all pray daily for world peace.  I also happen to think Crowe is one of the all-time great actors.  If you are into this kind of movie - then I could recommend this.

6934884,4,B00RTKEFSC,"Beautiful and moving this film, I recognize that you cry at some point.
Russell Crowe made his debut in the direction, without brilliance but with solvency and elegance.
He gives us a nice story framed in the 1st World War, specifically in the battle of Gallipoli.
But the war is the framework in which the characters are not the central theme of the film. The love between parents and children, loss, cultural and religious differences, hatred and resentment.
I have to say that the atmosphere, the locations (the Australian arid landscapes with it's red earth and the exotic Turkey with the impressive mosque of Istanbul) photography, costumes, the soundtrack is really great.
The interpretations are generally good, especially Mr Crowe.
Some scenes may be a bit long and adds nothing, but it is one minor flaw.

She didn't seem to fit, although she did a nice job.  I feel as if a Turkish woman would have improved the realism of this movie, but not my choice and maybe there were reasons why a Turkish woman wasn't employed for the role that I'm not aware of being, admittedly, ignorant of Turkish culture.  Other than that, the movie was pretty good though it seemed to jump a bit here and there but I suspect it had to be that way for time.

6934927,5,B00RTKEFSC,"As written by writers Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios and directed by Russell Crowe, THE WATER DIVINER is one of the most profoundly moving stories about the devotion between fathers and sons that has been placed before us on the screen. The photography in both Australia and Turkey is astonishingly beautiful and the interplay between past actions and current circumstances that create this story is sensitively interwoven, emphasizing the passionate need for re-connection even after war has torn a family asunder.

Based on real events, the story opens in Australia in 1915 where we find Connor (Russell Crowe) divining for water and successfully discovering a hard won well. He returns to his farmhouse and we meet his wife Natalia (Isabel Lucas) whose mind has been damaged by the loss of her three sons away at war  the Battle of Gallipoli. She pleads with Connor to find them, not admitting to herself that they are war casualties  a state of mind that eventually leads to her suicide. After burying his wife he promises her he will find their sons and he travels to Turkey to gain permission to get to Gallipoli, believing that his water divining powers will help him find their graves.  He meets with obstruction form the English and Australian military (Jai Courtney) still mopping up after the horrendous defeat by the Turks and gains help from a compassionate Turkish Major Hasan (Yilmas Erdogan) and his assistant Sgt Jemal (Cem Yilmaz). Meanwhile while awaiting papers to gain permission to go to Gallipoli Connor stays in a hotel in Istanbul where he meets hotel manager Ayshe (a brilliant Olga Kurylenko) and her son Orhan (Dylan Georgiades). The relationship is strained because Connor represents the enemy  (Australian) but there is a chemistry that sparks and a tenderness and mutual help results. Connor ultimately is allowed to go to Gallipoli (Hope's a necessity where I come from), finds the bones of two of his sons, but the third is missing  he was taken prisoner  and it is this remaining live son that binds the story of the love between the Connor, his deceased sons and his deceased wife together in an ending that will gnaw at the emotions long after the film is over.

The cast is uniformly excellent with Russell Crowe in an especially brilliant and subtle performance. THIS is an Oscar worthy film. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, September 15",1442016000,,2380,4.947368421052632
6934928,4,B00RTKEFSC,Very much enjoyed the movie.  A little something for they guys and the gals.  The love story part was a little formulaic but the setting and storyline were unique and therefore interesting. All of the actors were great throughout.,1442016000,,230,4.871794871794871
6934929,4,B00RTKEFSC,The storyline is compelling.  Interesting to learn of the WWI battle of Gallipoli... Russell Crowe shines as an actor - thought his directing was good as well.  Poignant story of a father's love and a bit of romance.  Modern conflicts in Turkish culture explored as is Turkish nationalism!  Well done and interesting!,1442016000,,317,5.038461538461538

6934947,4,B00RTKEFSC,"Russell Crowes Directorial Debut is a success. Perhaps those that live down under have heightened familiarity with the Battle of Gallipoli.but I didn't. I  enjoy historical drama, I enjoy a decent story telling which transports me to parts of the world otherwise unseen.
This movie accomplished these through the directors experienced eyes having been an actor-story teller in equal dramatic adventures for decades. If you're seeking only the action of a battlefield seen in the likes of Gladiator, this is different. The story being told here is one of a fathers devotion to his lost sons and a pledge made to his lost wife to find and return their boys home once again. Poignant, well acted, I found myself lost in the story telling, standing beside the seekers, looking forward to the next turn of events throughout the film. The Water Diviner spins this quest through unbiased neutral eyes, a unique vantage point for war related drama. having chosen this route, Crowe succeeds in creating focus on the familial love that fathers and sons share no matter which side of the battle field they fought behind. Without spoilers, the viewer should know this won't be the common formulaic tale of loss and redemption, the plot does have some unexpected turns along the way, All in all the main story is well developed; a romantic subplot adds counter point, all with subtle and genuine character portrayals for the sum total of a perfectly enjoyable evening of theatrical entertainment.",1441756800,2,1483,5.004048582995951

6934953,1,B00RTKEFSC,"This is one of the worse movies I've seen in the last couple of years. The set and the colors are beautiful and it is sad that it was wasted with poor acting, poor story and poor directing. Nothing flows in this movie, one minute you're in a romance and the next you're somewhere else. Don't be fooled by the beauty when you watch the trailer, that is why I rented this movie and it was a huge disappointment. I don't even think Russell C. believed in this movie himself, he looks like he was all over the place just like the movie.
I don't like to be harsh on movies because I know how much time and effort they take but this one made me upset I wasted my evening.",1441756800,6,665,4.083969465648855

6934962,4,B00RTKEFSC,"Somewhat surprising story about a WWI locale probably more well known to Australian viewers than those in the US.  An old fashioned sort of story with a hint of exotica but it comes together around Russell Crowe and his lovely Russian co-star.

6934967,5,B00RTKEFSC,I really enjoyed this movie.  Seeing Russell Crowe play a character who is just a farmer was very interesting and well done.  He is a very good actor.  When we think of Russell Crowe we think of him doing something like the brave and noble warrior in Gladiator.  However he plays the father  who is distraught over the fact his boys didn't come back from WW1.  His travels and the relationships with who he meets are very well portrayed.  The other actors in this movie do a likewise excellent job.,1441670400,,498,4.466666666666667

Bravo to Russell Crowe for taking this on!  I was riveted throughout the movie, although probably (mostly) due to my intense interest in the overall topic. As a film it wasn't quite up to par with countryman Mel Gibson's dramatic Braveheart or Apocalypto (who by the way starred in Peter Weir's excellent ""Gallipoli"" in 1981), but nevertheless a fine effort dealing with a rich, complicated topic.

6935082,5,B00RTKEFSC,"I knew nothing about what this movie was about other than the brief summary I read when I rented this and being a fan of Crowes acting and movies he has been in, I decided to check this one out.  I have been a historic war buff but I knew very little of the Battle of Gallipoli on which this is based, so I had to learn as the movie went along to figure out the basis for the battle.  It didn't make me like the movie any less but I did feel at a bit of a disadvantage initially in the story line.  I didn't realize this was also Crowes directorial debut and although I won't say it was a perfect one, he does a beautiful job at giving the appropriate feel of the time and of the area in Turkey in which this is based.  The battle scenes feel realistic to me and the atmosphere is well done.  Although this is a fictionalized story, the story of a father looking for his sons missing in the battle is a poignant one that those who have lost love ones in war can relate to.  Crowe does an excellent job at playing the role along with his supporting cast, who for the most part I was not familiar with.  Kurylenko was striking as Ayshe and Erdogan was great as Major Hasan.  Both played their roles very well.  The movie has the presiding feel of loss throughout but the slight love story that develops is nicely done without being overdone as some movies tend to do.  The movie is beautifully written, touching and is nicely done.  It is definitely one worth watching.

6935112,1,B00RTKEFSC,"Imagine a film set in 1946 Germany, in which an American man is looking for his sons lost in battle. He is befriended by a former SS Major who helps him in his search, and along the way he saves the Major from being killed by Soviets. The man falls in love with a German woman, while the Major conspires with fellow Nazis to regain control of Germany. This is presented as a Good Thing by the film.

Oh, and the Holocaust is never mentioned or implied. Rather, the Germans are presented as victims of foreign invaders.

Also, imagine the film was released on the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the Final Solution.

Now set the film in 1919 Turkey instead, exchange the Germans for Turks, and you have the plot to Russell Crowe's The Water Diviner - released on the 100th anniversary of the start of the Armenian Genocide.

From what I have read, Crowe was adamant that he be able to film in Turkey, where they have banned any mention of the Armenian or Greek Genocides. What if Germany had such a law regarding the Holocaust, and an American filmmaker chose to agree to their terms in order to make a film about WWII? What would you think of such a person?

Had the film focused more on the man, his family, and his journey, it might have succeeded. But very little of his journey is shown, and there is not much in the way of back story or character development. The pace was also uneven, with scenes thrown in for no apparent reason.",1440633600,8,1445,4.397003745318352

6935123,3,B00RTKEFSC,"This movie is the story of an Australian man who allows his sons to go off and fight in WWI at the Battle of Gallipoli in Turkey in 1915. He and his wife are devastated when the sons are apparently reported as dead by the army. His wife despairs so greatly that she kills herself, but her last wish is for her husband (Crowe) to go to Turkey and confirm that they are dead, and to bring their bodies home. Thus begins a great trip to Turkey for Joshua Connor (Crowe).

What do I say here? This is Russell Crowe's directing debut, and he does a solidly good job. There is nothing here to vehemently complain about, but honestly, this movie doesn't nail it out of the park either. I think I would give it 2.5 stars were that possible, but since amazon only lets you vote in whole stars, I'll give it 3 (2 seems too low).

Russell Crowe in my opinion takes a pretty big page from Steven Spielberg's playbook for this movie; this movie seemed to me to be a slightly lesser version of a Spielberg film. That is not to give discouraging words to Crowe, I think he should stick with it; this is a pretty solid job for a first time director. However, Spielberg seems to be able to achieve that misty-eyed sentimentality of movie magic. There is a feeling that permeates a Spielberg movie that says ""We are on the right side of history,"" and that the protagonist is also the moral center of the world around him. Crowe swings for that, but misses to a certain degree, when compared to Spielberg. I could also swear that there are shades of ""Indiana Jones"" in this movie.  If Crowe is going to emulate someone, Spielberg is a great place to start, although of course I hope Crowe develops his own voice as time goes on.

There are very few movies that really nail the time period, and there usually seems to be a modern edge around a historical movie. On the very short list of movies that seemed totally authentic, there would be ""Schindler's List,"" and ""The Artist."" ""The Water Diviner"" comes off feeling ever so slightly modern, and doesn't nail the time period, but that doesn't kill the movie. Overall, I knock off a few stars because there are a few moments that are a little too mystical and not believable, and a lot of the moments that are supposed to have serious gravity that kind of seem a little too ho-hum and casual. That feeling permeates the movie and drags it down a little. If we had a grittier movie with more realistic war scenes, then we'd have a substantially better movie. It also drags the movie down that Joshua Connor is somewhat of a victim throughout the movie, and the whole thing has a weepy tone. Great attempt by Crowe, but nothing here stands out resoundingly. 2.5 stars.",1440547200,,2695,4.42741935483871

6935143,4,B00RTKEFSC,I wondered when it was over if this story (as was the case with Hidalgo) was based on a real story (which Hidalgo reported to be but was not). I did enjoy the movie.

6935145,4,B00RTKEFSC,"I thought this was a wonderful movie. As others have given thorough synopses, I will not repeat the plot summary. I will offer one criticism that a little explanation of ANZAC would have helped me. I spent the first part of the movie confused as to why Australia and Turkey would be at war. But beyond that, I found the movie enthralling. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting and directing are very good. And later,  I find myself thinking about the movie themes, faith lost and found, finding friendship with one's enemy, a father's limitless love, forgiveness and redemption. So if you are looking for a movie that will make you think and perhaps even learn something I highly recommend this one.",1440374400,,705,4.778688524590164

It's a period piece that starts in Australia before WW1, and carries you through to the end of the war and some time afterwards. I had such a good time watching it, I think I'll watch it again, and that is something I NEVER do!

I'm not sure this is a DVD I'd buy or watch again, so it has 3 stars, but it kept our attention and when it was over, I was not sorry that I paid to see it.

All I saw was half of a High Def very slow agonizing movie where I began to feel like I was one of the ones being tortured.  There is no ""end game"" other than maybe the point is a lack of an ""end game"" and man's endless search for meaning.

6935182,2,B00RTKEFSC,"This was a disappointing film but well crafted and shot telling the story of a man's loss and attempt to rectify that.  There were some awfully clunky moments and the casting of Bond-girl, Olga Kurylenko, as the 'love interest' and Steve Bastoni as the 'villain'. as well as some very anachronistic lines, lost me.  I love David Hirschfelder's music, but somehow, it didn't sit well with the scenes and neither did the neatness and tidiness.  Some paint peeling, some old, rotting garbage discarded in streets and a tad more research would have taken this to another level. The positives would be the superb Andrew Lesnie cinematography and the fact that anyone told this story at all.  It just didn't have enough of the grit it required and casting of (stellar in some roles) Dan Wyllie as the uppity Brit soldier was the final straw for me.  Really?  His accent was appalling. Couldn't they have enticed someone like Sam West to do the job?  Similarly, Bastoni is no Turk and miscast: Australia has an army of Turkish actors who could have done the job so much better than his 'boo-hiss' villainry.  I so wanted to like this film.  But, by the end, I had had enough of Crowe's fakery. When will he learn to do angst and really 'feel' it?  The awfulness of his situation required something so much more ferocious but controlled (ie. like the Diggers themselves in the war and afterwards).  Had it been conceived with restraint (that kind of simmer of rage and desperation) rather than the soapie moments, it could have been a great film.",1440028800,,1538,4.701492537313433

Let's face it, if Russell Crowe shows up for a Muppets skit, neighborhood theatre, or even a throwaway miscellaneous script type movie, he makes it palatable if not great.

6935189,5,B00RTKEFSC,"I cannot explain how moving and wonderful this movie is. There are so many surprises! I felt like this was my quest; nearly forgetting I was watching a movie.  I had such admiration for the committment Russell's character made and how determined he was in fulfilling his word.  I cried and cheered throughout the the movie, (out loud a couple of times!), which is so unlike me.  It takes a lot for movie to elicit that kind of reaction, but this one did.
The only thing I didn't like about it is the title.  It just doesn't do it justice. It often confuses people when they hear it because they can't figure out what in the world the movie is about. If the title kind of turns you off, just put aside any reservations you have and watch this incredible film.  You'll be glad you did.",1439942400,,783,4.335616438356165

This, I think, was his finest characterization ever.  (Some of his humility--I know it isn't the real Russell Crowe, but, hey, that's what a great actor does--from Cinderella Man was on display.  He should try it in real life).  And he directed it to boot.  As one who is tired of being inundated with sex, nudity, and profanity, it was a pleasure to watch a film that will really appeal to adults.",1439510400,,556,4.622448979591836
6935266,4,B00RTKEFSC,"It was my privilege to walk the grounds of Gallipoli a few years back. Not as moving to me, an American- as Normandy, Bataan, Pearl Harbor or Gettysburg but moving none the less. Visiting the battle ground One can immediately see the problem. The Aussies were led by British old school generals who defaulted to trench warfare. What was needed was lightning warfare. They had the Turks on their heels but the commanding general told them to ""Dig! Dig! Dig!. (Thus the nickname ""Diggers"").
This is an excellent movie no doubt. My few complaints are the attempts to turn Greek partisans into bad guys (completely ignores the history of what the Greeks suffered at the hands of the Ottomans). Also those unfamiliar with history may be wondering how it is that the Aussies (and Brits and other colonial troops further down the peninsula) were driven off but the end of WWI finds them running Constantinople??. The short answer is that the Turks were aligned with the German/Austrian empire and their ""team"" ended up losing the war.
The Turkish actors and the Turkish language is real and very good. The presentation of early 20th century Constantinople and Anatolia is very good and accurate.
I was at the battle of Koh Tang Island 1975, which historians now call the last battle of Vietnam. We left three of my brothers (in arms) on the beach there. Their names are the last  names on the Vietnam memorial wall. This movie brought back many emotions.

6935288,5,B00RTKEFSC,"Russell Crowe' both directs and stars in the film that is inspired by true events, the killing-fields of 'Gallipoli' are
re-visited by the film-makers.
Four years have now past, 'Joshua Connor' (Russell Crowe) is an Australian farmer with a talent of being able to
locate water-sources upon his land.
During the war 'Joshua' and 'Eliza's (Jacqueline Mckenzie) three sons were reported missing-in-action during the
bloody battles at 'Gallipoli'
'Eliza' has never accepted the loss of their sons, tortured by the loss she commits suicide...at her graveside 'Joshua'
promises to bring the boys home.
He heads for 'Istanbul, Turkey' to find a way to go to the battlefield of four years ago to locate his sons, he will meet
with much opposition but with help will find a way to reach the beaches of 'Gallipoli' where he'll meet more obstacles
from the allied troops now based there, however 'Joshua' is going nowhere without finding their remains.
Tens of Thousands died and are buried on the battlefield, locating his sons will not be easy, he will be offered help by
an unexpected source that will both give him hope and truths.
His search will take him back to 'Istanbul' and to the Hotel where he had befriended widow 'Ayshe' (Olga Kurylenco)
and her young and helpful son 'Orhan' (Dylan Georglades) from where he will journey in this war-torn Country to
get answers he was yet to uncover.
This is 'Russell Crowe' at his best in this often moving drama which has several flashbacks depicting the fate of his sons
on the battlefields of 'Gallipoli'
This a sweeping and well portrayed drama well worth a viewing.

6935309,2,B00RTKEFSC,"The film, in part, tells that part of WWI, around 1915, involving U.K. forces storming the beach at Anzac Cove; part of the Gallipoli Campaign to fight Ottoman forces. U.K. forces were militarily superior with about equal numbers to the Turks, but they might have been a bit apathetic as they end up losing.  Story centers on the Australian contribution as represented by the three sons of an Aussie farmer. The event is still a significant Australian remembrance.

Negatives:
1. Although a small attempt was made to show that there is always another side in a war, what we get of the Turks is just movie stuff. The real history of this conflict with hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded is poorly treated.
2. A good part of the film is filled with the usual romantic encounter and discord and distrust. The female part in the movie is unrealistically
attractive for the role, thus not too believable. Tossed in is the customary plot hook of her engaging young son to reel in the Aussie who, of course, had lost his wife.
3. More obstacles are placed in our hero's search for his lost sons with unusually cold bureaucratic barriers being placed in his way - to be overcome, of course. Again, not believable.
4. Dialogue was inane. Directing was disjointed in that the film used excessive numbers of flashbacks to explain what could have been given at the beginning and resulted in better continuity to the story. Acting was too predictable and a bit stereotyped. Ending also became too
predictable..",1439164800,4,1504,4.758620689655173

6935396,4,B00RTKEFSC,"If you like historical setting around major events that have shaped the world and you like a nice blend of tragedy, mystery and hope, I think you will enjoy the 'diviner'. Don't get too hooked on the title as a hinge point for the action. It's largely symbolic and the true story hidden in the earth is not water but rather how impossibly diverse elements of human nature can come, meet and face their devils together. One can't help but feel the impact of The Devine as well as the role of the 'diviner' in this movie. Russell Crowe is very convincing as the 'humbled' hero looking for redemption. Great support characters of much lesser known fame share in similar trials and outcomes.

My judgement is from the personal perspective of having to bare more pain than I ever thought possible. Crowe depicts a beautiful love story emerging from the most tragic of times. I brought the remains of my best friend home from the war. Crowe deals with such an event with accurate attention to the intense emotions involved. In the film, new life with hope springs from the agony of conflict. In reality, it may or may not happen, in my case it did. There is wonderful camera work, with wide scene setting views and a plethora of landscapes and characters that all work together perfectly. Take a look at the credits and observe all the stunt doubles.....action is defiantly a part of this film.....well worth the price.

But, seeing as I paid for the rental, I made myself watch it through to the end so I wouldn't feel like such a schmuck for renting a moving I'd never heard of.  The movie starts out strong, but loses its way.  I kept getting the feeling that someone said, right, Gladiator was a huge hit.  (SPOILERS AHEAD)  What can we do that will be just like that, only not?  Guy's a farmer. Check. His wife and child die. Check. Check.  He's taken away to an exotic Arabian land. Check. Where he meets a beautiful young single mother and her precocious son. Check. Check. Check.  What could have been a powerful story of a man's dedication to his sons was wimpified and made almost ridiculously formulaic by the pasted-on love interest (complete with abusive brother-in-law, because, hey, Gladiator had Joaquin, right?)  I ended up with a migraine from all the eye-rolling, and the big payoff of the finale doesn't even involve the son.  Because they had to wrap up the sappy, tacked-on love story.  Had the filmmakers done away with the silly subplot of the damsel-in-distress, (and why do these damsels always have to be HALF the actor's age?!)  it would have been able to focus on the spirit of the story, and brought the film down to a more digestable running time.",1438128000,,1367,4.53469387755102

It is also about a movie about trying to recover something which is lost and gaining something you thought you would never have again.  Great cast and beautiful scenery that will make you want to learn more about the events of WW I.  I would not only recommend that you see it but I will promise you that I will watch it many times.  It's that kind of movie,1437955200,,660,3.9545454545454546
6935525,4,B00RTKEFSC,"The Water Diviner takes place in 1919. An Australian farmer Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe) travels to Turkey to retrieve the remains of his three sons, lost in the Battle of Gallipoli campaign of World War I. When he arrives in Istanbul, he encounters others who have suffered their own losses in the conflict: Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko), a beautiful young widow whose own husband was killed in the war; her young son, Orham (Dylan Georgiades), who finds a friend in Connor; and Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan), a Turkish officer who fought against Connors boys and who may be Connors only hope for closure. With one obstacle after another in his path, Connor must travel across the Turkish landscape to discover the truth.

The Water Diviner marks Russell Crowes debut as director. He uses flashbacks to show the three brothers on the battlefield and the brutality of warfare. Though intense and bloody, the battle scenes are not the primary attraction of the film. This is not a movie that glorifies war. It is about the heavy burden of loss for people on both sides of the conflict. Historically, Gallipoli was a key event in the emergence of Australia and New Zealand, former colonies of the British Empire, as individual nations.

The Water Diviner is quite a task for a first-time director. Crowe successfully blends the personal story of Connor with the background of the recent, devastating battle while turning in a believable performance. His acting method of choice is underplaying and letting his reactions communicate what hes thinking. He admirably handles the films spectacle while keeping in focus its characters. Too often, in a movie such as this, spectacle takes precedence over character development. Ultimately, The Water Diviner is the story of a sad quest. Incorporating elements of Shenandoah, in which a father cant stay neutral when his sons are drawn into war, and Saving Private Ryan, with its graphic up-close images of horror and death in battle, Crowe chronicles the journey of a man looking for what he hopes will bring him peace.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a behind-the-scenes, making-of featurette and an overview of the Battle of Gallipoli on its 100th anniversary.",1437955200,2,2210,5.049315068493151
6935526,5,B00RTKEFSC,"Some truly exquisite scenery and cinematography here, courtesy of the late great Andrew Lesnie. Russell Crowe makes his directorial debut with this,  and his sure touch and ability to craft a fascinating storyline without resorting to mawkishness and/or preachiness makes this a really wonderful film. I won't give away too much of the plot, other than to say it's set in the aftermath of the disastrous Gallipoli campaign of 1915, but this is not a sweeping war epic. The focus here is on individuals and how they are impacted, in various and sometimes surprising ways, by a horrific event.

6935548,5,B00RTKEFSC,"Water Diviner is directed by & stars Russell Crowe (Joshua Connor) as an Australian living in the desert who can divine or find water sources.  It claims to be inspired by a true story however the veracity of such a claim is not provided and so appears to be a case of wishful thinking on the part of screenwriters Andrew Anastasios & Andrew Knight.

When his three sons enlist in the military and go missing in Turkey after the WWI battle of Gallipoli, and his wife loses her mind, Connor embarks on a mission to find them. All he has to go on is one sons journal replete with blood-stained pages. Upon arriving, he learns he will be denied permission to travel to Gallipoli & search when the Brits are sorting out the dead four years after the battle. Connor finds a way and using his innate gifts is able to bring about closure.

Water Diviner is a different kind of movie. It reminds me somewhat of Life is Beautiful in that its subject matter is heart-wrenching, serious-as-a-heart-attack yet sweetened throughout with shards of humor. These shards wrench laughter from viewers but still stab ones heart & the laughter is a kind of emotional pressure valve.

So, too, Water Diviner intersperses grief & horrific loss with quirky moments of tenderness, devotion, and affection. I thought it worked out well. I would have appreciated the elimination of any romantic inclination between Connor & Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko).

After watching Peter Weir's wonderful movie, Gallipoli (Mel Gibson), it was most enlightening to have the Turkish viewpoint present throughout the movie. It was interesting that the Turks (Yilmaz Erdogan as Major Hasan) claimed war was always about land while Connor asserted that the ANSACs fought on principle. A recommended movie worth watching if only for its historical significance.",1437264000,,1811,4.944078947368421

The film is a very real war drama based during WWI in the Turkish region of the Gallipoli Peninsula.  The film also has a spiritual or mystic quality to it as Russel Crowe's character, Joshua Conner, is gifted as a Water Diviner.  The film was moving, touching, and entertaining.  It brought out so many different emotions.

6935577,4,B00RTKEFSC,"Really a 4.5 star review but not fIve. A good directorial debut by Rusty and not bad acting in the lead role. It is, after reading the book/script close but the main character, the outback farmer Joshua Conner, in the book is a harder, meaner man than that played by Mr Crowe. In the book Mr Conner shoots his dog before heading off to Turkey-Rusty avoided that moral dilemma. Preferred the complexity of the man in the book-makes morse sense of the story line. Based on a true story? Tenuous. An Aussie appears on the beach/battlefields of Gallipoli, looking for his son/s; annoys the Brits and then disappears from the pages of his history. But, nonetheless it is an enjoyable film and captures a period of history well-the waste of life at Gallipoli followed by the carving up of the Ottoman Empire and the birth of Turkish nationalism. All a backdrop for a farmer searching for his dead sons and to bring them home to bury alongside their mother...horde chases, high body counts and lots of explosions along the way. ""Whats that drone?"" asks Rusty on his first night in Constantinople. ""Oh that's the crowds in the Colosseum calling for Gluteus Maximus!"" Oh no, sorry, its the calling to prayer. Wrong movie.

6935581,4,B00RTKEFSC,"Russell Crowe plays Joshua Connor, the father of three sons lost in combat and husband to a wife lost to grief. He journeys to Gallipoli to find his son's remains and bring them home. It is only in the last few decades that travel to the peninsula has been straightforward. Previously it was a restricted and very sensitive area and Connor has to surmount considerable obstacles to even get there. The journey does not end here though and an eye opening trip is taken through a Turkey under renewed attack.

So despite the film's release 100 years after the battle, there is a lot more going on than first expected. Yes, it looks at the battle and there are certainly some harrowing flashback battle scenes that really ram home the horror of fighting and the terrible consequences of serious war wounds but it also looks at people. Firstly, at the grief that war causes (on both sides) but also the need that people have to connect with others. There's a surprise or two in terms of the events in Turkey. The people are shown in a sympathetic light and there are some interesting developments. All the actors are excellent, though a couple of characters are absurdly obnoxious in an attempt to create drama. The settings are first rate and a couple of scenes are very powerful.

There is a lot to commend this film. It has a fascinating central idea and there is a touch of magic to it at times. It is a powerful look at the effect of war on people.",1433203200,3,1449,4.505703422053232
6935582,5,B00RTKEFSC,"Russell Crowe, who also directed (this is his debut at the helm), plays Connor, an Australian farmer whose specialty is finding water beneath the land  thus the title. His three sons have died in 1915's battle of Gallipolli, and after his distraught wife commits suicide, he decides to go to Turkey to recover their bones or at least to know their fate. We are now in 1919, the First World War has just ended, but not for Turkey, who has seen its capital Constantinople occupied by Western forces, while its Aegean coast have been invaded by Greece (Greeks are the bad guys in this movie, in one scene they are shown killing defenseless Turkish villagers and in another they treacherously attack Turkish patriots on a train). The English forces are lukewarm to Connor in his quest for his son's remains, but he finds an unlikely help in a Turkish major (played with dignity by Yilmaz Erdogan) who fought on the other side in the battle and thus has a good idea of the circumstances of the deaths of Connor's sons. While in Constantinople, Connor finds lodging in a nice boutique hotel run by the beautiful Ayshe (played believably by the Ukrainian model Olga Kurylenko), whose Turkish husband, we eventually learn, has also presumably died in Gallipolli. Connor and Ayshe starts getting close to each other, though no doubt in deference to Turkish sensibilities, the relationship between Connor and Ayshe is never shown as consummated (and frankly, given the conservatism at the time of Turkish society, would it have been believable for an Australian national to have a romantic relationship with an Ottoman woman during this period?)

The movie is not perfect, but it has many praiseworthy aspects, including a wonderful photography and a careful reconstruction of Constantinople, down to the crowded, narrow streets where veiled women and men in their traditional Turkish hats hassled. The film does hit at least a couple of false notes: one particular scene, that I found jarring, has the Crowe character and Ayshe's brother in law (who wishes to marry her and occupy his late brother's place) get into a fist fight over her. The other scene that I did not like, which I won't reveal in detail, appears near the end and it has to do with the ultimate resolution of Connor's quest for his sons. But despite these particular shortcomings, this is an accomplished debut by Crowe.",1433030400,3,2380,4.888613861386139

6935584,1,B00RTKEFSC,"Wow, what can one think about this trashy movie... Turkish propaganda with revisionist history in mind is a good start... In the whole movie history seems to have been twisted in a parallel universe... There is no reference at all to the millions of Armenians and Greeks that were exterminated and thrown out of their native lands, even referencing them at one point as ""the devil's army""... Sad really, considering they were the native christian popularions of Anatolia trying to survive the Turkish aggression (reminiscent of modern day's tactics used by ISIS in the middle east). I do not expect a history lesson from a Hollywood star, but this blatant fantasy is insulting to those victims and survivors as this movie is touted as being based on a true story. P.S. If an Australian was found wandering in Anatolia at the time this movie takes place, lets just say he wouldn't be left wandering along all nice and free for long there. Nevermind that whatever is left of this story is oversentimental, long and just corny, with Russell being his usual scowling overdramatic self.

6935589,4,B00RTKEFSC,"""The Water Diviner"" (2014 release from Australia; 111 min.) brings the story of Joshua Conner (played by Russell Crowe) and his family. As the movie opens, we are reminded that the movie is ""inspired by true events"". We are transported to December 20, 1915 to the Battle of Gallipoli, where the Turks are overpowering the ANZACs. We then switch to ""North Western Victoria"", where we see Conor looking for, and finding water (and building a well). At dinner time, Connor's wife is resentful. ""You can find water, but you can't find your own kids?"", she hisses. Shortly thereafter, she drowns in the lake near the house. After the burial, Connor decides to go to Turkey to look for his three sons, whom he urged to fight ""for flag and country"" and who are presumed dead. At this point we're just 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, it is remarkable that it has taken this long, but this movie marks the directing debut of Russell Crowe. Why he hasn't taken this up sooner, I don't know, but better late than never. Second, the movie makes an almost critical error by not giving a brief historical background note at the beginning of the movie. Do you know who the ANZACs are, and why Australian soldiers ended up fighting in Turkey 100 years ago? I sure didn't. I picked up bits and pieces along the way as the movie unfolded but still, I felt that was an oversight that could've been easily avoided. Third, the script does a good job in providing flashbacks of the Gallipoli battle which eventually reveal what happened to the Connor boys. At the same time, while the movie is ""inspired"" by true events, let's be honest here and just say it outright: this is a historical fictional drama, and quite entertaining, but fictional nevertheless. Last but not least, Crowe leads a cast of mostly unknowns (for me anyway). The little boy who leads Connor to finding a hotel in Istanbul is just delightful, and the little boy's mother is stunningly beautiful. Bottom line: this movie makes for an enjoyable and entertaining historical drama (it won Best Picture at the Australian version of the Oscars this year).

The movie finally opened this weekend on two screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. The matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay, and it seemed that the audience was really enjoying the movie quite a bit. This isn't going to see the box office on fire here in the US, but it's a nicely made movie, showing a softer side of Russell Crowe as well as demonstrating that the man certainly knows hoe to direct a movie. If you are into historical dramas, you cannot go wrong with this. Definitely worth check out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",1430006400,43,2834,4.6546906187624755
6935590,3,B00RTKEFSC,"April 25th will mark the centenary of Anzac Day, which is a little like Australia's version of our Memorial Day. The holiday was originally created to honor the Australian and New Zealand soldiers who fought and died at the battle of Gallpoli. Whatever else one may think of Russell Crowe; the man takes his heritage seriously and has dedicated his directorial debut, The Water Diviner, to those who died in the fighting and those who must live with their sacrifice. It's a sincere, genuine effort by Crowe, even if some of the fantastical, romantic aspects are misplaced.

The curiously-titled film is both a realistic war drama and a mystical fairy tale, and the styles don't always marry perfectly.  Crowe settles in nicely as grieving father, Joshua Connor, a water diviner in Australia struggling to cope with the disappearance of his three sons in the war. Joshua's profession matches the spiritual tone of the film as a water diviner is a cherished figure capable of finding ground water, graves, and rare ores through some kind of sixth sense. Flashbacks figure heavily, jumping back in time to when Joshua was happier, his wife was vibrant rather than grief-stricken, and his sons were imaginative young men obsessed with ""The Arabian Nights"".  That all changed when Joshua allowed his sons to join the ANZAC, and it was one time when his natural instinct utterly failed him.

Although he's forsaken God in the four years since the boys' disappearance and presumed death, Joshua swears an oath to bring them home so they can be buried on consecrated ground. Arriving in Gallipoli to put his divining skills to the test, Joshua encounters no end of hurdles from the British government and the Turkish people who mistrust outsiders. However, he does find companionship in a precocious little boy and his recently-widowed mother Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko), a Turkish woman running a local hotel. He also gains support from Major Hasan (Ylmaz Erdoan), a leader of the Turkish army helping the ANZAC ""Grave Unit"" find missing soldiers.

An interesting and rewarding choice made by Crowe and the screenwriters was to focus heavily on the Turkish experience and the effects of winning the big battle yet losing the war.  They've been left to watch their culture and the very land under their feet ripped out from under them. Crowe clearly has a sympathetic eye for their plight, but also a disdain for those who sold the war to young Australian men under false pretenses. Meanwhile all of the British soldiers are portrayed as pencil-neck girly men, and the Greek combatants as brutish thugs. That oversimplification applies also to the unnecessary romance between Joshua and Ayshe, which is like someone felt they needed to give Crowe a love scene. Joshua's comical misunderstanding of Ottoman culture, especially when it pertains to interpersonal relationships, should have been in a romantic comedy rather than a serious wartime drama.

But those are issues with the screenplay and not Crowe's first-rate direction. He has a clear eye for big set pieces, and the Hellish war scenes are impressive, along with a harrowing sandstorm that threatens Joshua's family. Working alongside cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, a frequent collaborator with Peter Jackson, this is a handsomely-shot, simply composed first effort by Crowe. While he's no longer the buff, chiseled figure he was in Gladiator, Crowe is still a rugged, physical actor and gets plenty of opportunity here to play the hero. He's better in the smaller moments, though, as a grieving father just trying to fulfill a promise.

Crowe is going through some of the same growing pains that marked Angelina Jolie's directorial debut a few years ago, another film of sizable scope set in a war-torn setting. Like her, Crowe has shown he has potential as a filmmaker, and The Water Diviner is accomplished enough to be excited about his new career path.",1429833600,59,3904,5.051242236024844

His wife's (Jacqueline McKenzie) dying wish was for her sons to be buried back in Australia. Working with few clues, Connor embarks on a trip where he is a hated stranger in a strange land, yet inspires and helps those around him. The opening claims it was ""inspired by true events"" but is closer to historical fiction. Yes, an Australian did go to Turkey to look for his son's grave and they sent him away.

Connor was able to locate his sons in a country that is ""one big grave."" Crowe did a good job as an older and more humble man than his usual roles. Model Olga Kurylenko plays the innkeeper who becomes an undeveloped love interest for Crowe. Good Drama with war background.

8695825,5,B00RTKEFSC,"Based on an historical novel of the same title by Meaghan Wilson-Anastasios and Andrew Anastasios, this superb drama tells the highly fictionalized story of Joshua Connor, an Australian outback farmer whose three sons (according to this story) all went into the battle at Gallipoli and were reported to have died on the same day.

Four years later, his wife can no longer stand their absence and the fact that none of them are coming home and apparently walks into a pond and drowns herself. Before doing so, however, she asks her husband to go to Turkey and find their remains and bring her boys home.

With nothing less to lose, Connor boards a steamship for Istanbul and upon arrival finds himself unwelcome and rebuffed at every turn.

Not to be dissuaded or discouraged, however, he hires a fisherman to transport him to Gallipoli and there proceeds to do the seemingly impossible.

This film offers beautiful cinematography alongside a lovely screenplay full of hope and strength of character.

It is fiction of course. But it does at least hint (for those previously uninformed) at the horrors of the 10 month campaign at Gallipoli. The film speaks of 70,000 Turks lost and 10,000 Britains. In fact, Britain lost 161,000 dead and more than 90,000 sick and injured evacuees; Turkey's sole victory of World War I cost that nation roughly 250,000 dead.

Still, the film is not an encyclopedia. It is art. And as such, it is very fine indeed.",1528588800,,1445,4.82995951417004
