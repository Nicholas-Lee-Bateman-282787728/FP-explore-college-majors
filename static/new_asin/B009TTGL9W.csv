5368637,5,B009TTGL9W,"All the other reviews here are for the first edition which came out about 3 years ago.  This is the same as that edition which was Fan-tastic and also includes a third dvd and a bonus 1988 slam dunk content.  All three dvds are double sided which makes it hard to tell what's on which disc unless you look at the table of contents in the box.  Other than that it is a must have for any true nba fan because it has 5 of Jordan's top games included in their entirety.  I mean it even has the intro and network theme song in the beginning.  Remember when the NBA was on CBS in the mid 80s?  Brings back memories of the early Bulls team battling the Pistons.  The quality is excellent. They must have cleaned up some of the older games from the 1980s.  The five games are the 63 pt game in Boston, 69 pt game in Cleveland, finals game against the Suns, the flu game against Utah in the 1997 finals and the final 1998 finals game.  These games in itself are worth the 23.99 because they are just of unbelivable quality.  It was like they played those games yesturday.  There is no sign of age on the telecasts like some of those re-broadcast games on Classic Sports network.  So you guys can throw away all those grainy games you recorded on VHS tapes from t.v.  The 1988 slam dunk contest is also in its entirety starting from the introductions of the contestants to Jordan's post-dunk interview.  I just wish it had more games like ""the shot pt. 1 and 2"", finals game 2 against the Lakers, and more games against the Pistons and Knicks.  But maybe they are saving that for the 30th anniversary edition.",1097798400,33,1599,4.301003344481606

The most impressive thing is that he seemingly does it all in the flow of the game, and doesn't seem like he's trying to blow you out with scoring... just doing whatever the team needs.

5368691,4,B009TTGL9W,"I always have and always will be a Boston Celtics fan but I have to admit that for a period in the 90s I always enjoyed watching the Bulls and especially Jordan play.  There never has and probably never will be an athlete that completely dominated his sport like this guy.  Before I got this very good 3-Disc Anniversary set as is so human I forgot just how good this guy was and after watching Kobe and LeBron for some time recently I began to wonder if Jordan really was THAT good.  Thankfully I got this set and after watching how he owned the very good Cavs and later Jazz teams it reminded me just how good he was and indeed Kobe and LeBron have quite some ways to go to reach this guy's achievements.

The best parts of this set for me are the complete games especially his final one for the Bulls although the picture quality hasn't been restored and so isn't great.  This dvd set is a fitting tribute to the great career of a basketball legend.  It is well packaged in a digipak cardboard design too.

Fans of basketball should look no further than this great tribute to the best that ever played the game.

Highly recommended!",1266537600,2,1135,4.345971563981043
5368692,5,B009TTGL9W,"I remember first seeing this dvd when I was in 7th grade because my homeboy Brandon had it. This DVD really shows how ham that this guy went in his career from 1984-1998. The Come fly with me came out during the beginning of his prime and thats included in this. The Playground had like a play about the guy who played in Meance 2 Society who didn't make his basketball team and thruoght this segment, Jordan is telling him about how he overcame his scaredness, and became a successfull NBA player, but it shows clips from the 1989-1990 and 1990-1991 season. The 3rd segment on side A of the first DVD talks about him throught the 1991-1992 season and this guy destroyed Miami in that first round. Side B talks about his return and retirement from 1995-1998. It includes games like 55 vs Phoenix 1993 finals the flu game game 6 1998 finals and his 69 point performance vs Cleveland March of 1990. If you really ant to know how good he was this and the Chicago Bulls of the 1990s would be the perfect DVD to purchase.",1266451200,,1016,4.380952380952381

I recommended this unique collection to every MJ fan, is the best that you can have right now.",1242432000,,371,4.904761904761905
5368697,5,B009TTGL9W,"To be honest, this is the best deal of any Sports DVD boxset ever created. The Ultimate Jordan box set contains five MJ videos from Michael Jordan playground to His Airness and Michael Jordan special features from Top 10 plays to the 1988 Dunk Contest.

That would probably be a solid deal for any MJ fan but included along with that is five uncut games which includes The Last Shot in a Bulls uniform, The Flu Game, Jordan 69 point performance against Cleveland, 1993 NBA Finals 55 point performance, and Michael Jordan torching Boston in 1986 for 63 points.

The quality of the games is perfect and bring back alot of memories of Jordan from his early career to the end of his Bulls career. (It would have been nice to add some Washington Wizards highlights but I figure there was a reason for that)

The price is reasonable and the games are great to relive, you would be a fool not to own it.",1239408000,,896,4.418181818181818

This is the type of sports figure I don't mind my grandson imitating - he's quite an athlete and a gentleman.  I loved the video almost as much as my grandon!",1209254400,,341,4.380952380952381
5368723,4,B009TTGL9W,"The Ultimate Jordan collection is a rare find; a raw compilation of Jordan's life on and off the court that - convincingly - reveals the man beneath the player. It is a must see as it features successive documentaries--from his early childhood to the six and final NBA championship title, topped off with his 5 all-time games. His determination and creativity will be forever remembered in the Bulls 23 singlet. However his personality; charisma; and optimism are why he remains so profoundly loved today.",1207353600,2,505,5.023809523809524
5368724,5,B009TTGL9W,"As I watched this DVD set over and over again, at times I simply became very emotional. The man Michael Jordan was a human comet. The phenomenon happens only once fifty years. Michael was for basket ball just THAT. His skills were such that even the man himself couldn't believe he himself did some of those incredible shots; incredible moves. This is simply mystical to be honest. I know that in my life time and in his own life time there will never be another player like Jordan. This guy was for the basket ball what Elvis was for rock, James Brown for soul music and Tiger Wood for golf. Just can't be duplicate for at least three generation. The God who created those skills in Micahel is right now at rest and will not be up again until 2050 at the earliest.

5368728,5,B009TTGL9W,"Don't think. Just buy the DVD! If you're a Michael Jordan fan, this is a no brainer. This really is the ULTIMATE Jordan Collector's Edition DVD - it will exceed your expectations. Just being able to watch full, non-edited games of Michael Jordan play is worth getting this DVD.  5 of his games:

1986 [NBA Playoffs 1st Round Game 2] vs. Boston Celtics (Jordan scores 63 points) See a young Jordan and Larry Bird in short-shorts. Haha.

1990 [Regular Season Game] vs. Cleveland Cavaliers (Jordan scores 69 points) -- Jordan's old coach Doug Collins (who favors Jordan more than anyone) does the announcing for this game. Also Steve Kerr (later played in the Bulls with Jordan) was playing on the Cavaliers. This broadcast was on TNT and you can see a young Crag Sager too; I think he looks the same with his hair! Haha. Michael Jordan just dominates in this game and even gets Lenny Wilkens, the head coach for Cavaliers at the time, ejected. Fun game to watch.

1993 [NBA Finals Game 4] vs. Phoenix Suns (Jordan scores 55 points)
See a young Charles Barkley too (He's great on TNT). Entertaining and very intense from start to finish. The ending free-throw with Dan Majerle  on the Suns just made me laugh! He ends up making the free-throw he was supposed to miss intentionally and misses the first one he was supposed to make. Haha. After watching this game, I wish they included Game 6 with John Paxson hitting the big three. ""Paxson for three.... YEEEES!""

1997 [NBA Finals Game 5] vs. Utah Jazz (Jordan scores 38 points - ""THE FLU GAME"") -- This was the only game I actually missed watching at the time, so I was so ecstatic when this game was included in the DVD! I love how the DVD also includes NBA on NBC's opening game introduction footage with Marv Albert doing the voiceover, and then NBA on NBC theme song! It gives me chills. Also the PA arena starting line-ups is amazing at the Utah Jazz with fireworks. Even though Jordan doesn't score some crazy numbers, this game is like watching a theatrical movie; it's an intense game, and watching a very exhausted Jordan still finish the game in style is just really inspiring. It was also a touching moment when Pippen came over and held Jordan. I'm glad they included this game.

1998 [NBA Finals Game 6] vs. Utah Jazz (Jordan's final game in a Bulls' uniform) Any NBA fan should remember this game. Jordan's final game in a Bull's uniform. What a perfect way to win the Championship with ""the shot"". I remember I was screaming when he made that final shot live on TV. The NBA today is just full of young players, but back then, it was a true veteran's game against Stockton/Malone.

I wish they will make more DVDs that contain full NBA games. I'd like to see the actual game of Michael Jordan's famous shot over Craig Ehlo.

I miss Michael Jordan and NBA on NBC! I was obsessed with basketball because of those two reasons. I love the theme music for NBA on NBC before the games; it really pumps one up before watching a game! You'll get to have that nostalgic feeling again from this DVD.

This DVD also of course has many videos dedicated to Jordan's life, career, greatest dunks/moments, and many priceless footage! I thought it was hilarious seeing Jordan actually make a golf ""jump shot"" hole-in-one.

I really doubt there will ever be another Michael Jordan (or 90's Chicago Bulls - 72-10 record - MJ, Pippen, Rodman, Phil). Michael Jordan is the epitome of the best. He was the NBA. I don't look up to that many people, but he really was my hero.  [cue ""(I wanna) Be Like Mike""  song]

I miss those days, but with this DVD, I can feel the nostalgia all over again.",1200700800,6,3632,4.533639143730887

Jordan may not hold every record for the NBA but there is no denieing he is the best overall all round player there has ever been, weather he's taking off 15 feet away from the ring and hanging in the air deciding if he should dunk the ball, pass it off or just switch hands and lay it up to being a defensive player who can block the biggest and baddest, steal from the quickest or just smile at them and blind them with his charms, Jordan will live amongst the top 5 players of all time and forever be #1 in my book.

Disc 1 features all those VHS videos they brought out over the years that you have probably already seen - ""Come Fly With Me"", ""MJ's Playground"" & ""Air time"" then on the flip side you get ""Above and Beyond"" and ""His Airness"" which i'm not sure if I ever saw on VHS but its basicly a recap of the first 3 videos. Also on the other side you get bonus features of a few of MJ's top ten's, dunks, moves, clutch shots, assists, the greatest memories, music video trubutes, Jordans career timeline highlights, Michaels great eight and the best feature of them all, the DVD credits

on the other 2(4) discs you have full versions of Michaels greatest games.  Disc 2-A is the 1986 1st round play offs vs Larrd Bird and the Celtics where his airness scored 63 points and really put himself on the map.
Disc2-B is the 1990 regular season game vs. the Cavaliers where Jordan scores his career high of 69 points.

Disc 3-A has two games, the 1993 game 4 of the finals vs. Phoenix where Jordan scores 55 points & then the 1997 NBA finals vs the Jazz in game 5 where he scores 38 points.
disc 3-B: Jordans final game for the Bulls in the 1998 finals in game 6 vs the jazz with Jordans last clutch shot to end a perfect career....errr, with the bulls.

There is also some DVD rom features on disc1 side b, its an interactive menu that you can choose to view MJ's career stats of regular season, playoffs & all star games. A trivia game to play on MJ, photo gallery, upper deck trading card pics, the demo version of NBA Live 2001 where you can play 1 on 1 only featuring Jordan, Kobe, Payton and a couple of others, install and play it, and also theres links to stuff.

I'm satasfied with the 6 discs, all I wouldve asked to be included would be the full versions of the slam dunk contests and the game where he nailed Mr. June against the Blazers with 3 point shot after 3 point shot.

I'd also have liked to see some of his stuff with the Wizards, but I beleive this DVD was made before 2001 when he cam eout of retirment again to help lift them, but what can you do.

I give it four and a half stars overall, itd be the perefct five if it had the above i mentioned, but hell, for the Jordan fan, this should not disapoint anyone.

There's even a special section entitled ""Jordans's 10 greatest Moves"" hint: believe it or not, Jordans best all time move was not even a dunk, I've always thought it was his greatest move when I first saw it, and this DVD confirms and agrees with me!..(sorry Nets fans)  This DVD will serve as the bar for all future arguments about who was the greatest of all time for any newcomer to the league.  Instead of arguing, put these discs in and they will speak for themselves forever, to posterity!

You get to relive 5 of Jordan's best games ever (including the 86' playoff game against the Celtics and his 69 point performance against the Cavs.)

You get TONS of extras, including a music video and a Spike Lee/Nike montage.

This is absolutely worth the $ if you're a basketball fan and it's worth double if you're a Jordan fan.

My only complaint is that there isn't more games to enjoy.

You will also find one of the newest witch is ""Michael Jordan - Hiss Airness"", this one tell you about the career life of MJ in a good level of details.

But in my opinion what really matter in this set is the full games in this set. Is the perfect selection of great games. Is incredible to watch the 69 point's game when he shoots only about 40 times!

I'm from Brazil and I bought it one year ago when it first released, because I thought was a very limited edition, but apparently not. So don't waste your time and buy as soon as you can. I highly recomment for those who are or not a MJ fan!

Has every video released....It's now on dvd.

Also has his top dunks, passes, etc...

And to top it off it has his 4 greatest games....well so they say! I honestly though the games they put on the 20th Anni dvd were pretty avarage... Well I could think of other games we're I though he'd played better ball. But hey we can't complain here

Video Quality

Being a old source I wasn't expecting anything great. The Jordan video's are a little grainy. Some or more recent games (games against Utah etc..) look good on dvd. Nice colours and so fourth. Pity that it's in 4:3.

I notice a lot American TV is still 4:3... weird? get with the times!

3 out of 5 for picture quality

Sound Quality

You have DD 2.0 and DD 5.1..

I have to say I was impressed with the 5.1! the music is the main feature here! as it comes through the surrounds and LFE.

Don't expect it to be demo material but this really does hold up on it's own!

The whole dvd set is very much worth it and I was happy to purchase it from Amazon.com.

As mentioned if you're a Jordan fan and you have his video's upgrade to the dvd set.

Now we just have to wait for the Untoucha - Bulls and Three-peat with MJ and so on..

Too bad that players of today will never come close and instead need to be all they can be so that they can remembered by their God given names. Robert Orry, Kobe, Dwayne Wade, Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, T-mac, Tim Duncan, Shaq to name a few, just be yourselves cause Jordan was on his own level and may have just been in his own world. Game commentaters stop comparing Jordan to these little trash players that aren't worthy of his heart and scarafice that he made to made so that the world of basketball would even be worth watching since  most of its best stars haven't played since the 90's . No way should some of these guy be paid what they are paying them. Since Jordan left the Bulls most of America doesn't watch basketball. There's only one Jordan just let it go. Anyway, I love watching this  dvd. Oh yeah I'm glad they have raised the age for players to enter the NBA, this will deleted some of the trash and also you guys need to remember all the best players went to college. Jordan hipes you up and makes you believe he can do it and you can at try to do it. By the way I'm proud of the Bulls this year, I also like how there is no stars on the Bulls or Pistons they just play together reminds me of somebody hummm 80's lakers and 90's Bulls???

the begining of the air time was also change comparing with the VH format....the music in this is too heavy..specially in the

10 best plays of Mr God. is a unequal reaction between the excitment of the plays and the heavy horrible myusic they put on each play....

for the res i will give 5 stars to this marvelous collection..if anybody have the oportunnity to get COME AND FLY WITH ME and AIR TIME in VH format realeased by sports ilustrated you willsee the difference.

8544359,5,B009TTGL9W,"The greatest basketball player of all time without question. For any Michael Jordan fan, this is a must have. Jordan never won at everything dealing with the game of basketball which is highlighted within the dvd. It talks about him being cut from his high school team but coming back stronger the following year making Varsity and playing so good, he earned a scholarship to the University of North Carolina where he hit the game winning shot his freshman year to help the Tar Heels win a national championship. It takes you through Jordan's rise in the NBA after being drafted 1st round #3 to the Chicago Bulls but being unable to excel past the ""Bad Boy Detroit Pistons"" who kept eliminating the Bulls for 3 years straight. Finally, in 1991, the Bulls destroyed Detroit in 4 straight games advancing to the NBA finals where Magic Johnson and the showtime Lakers fell victim to Michael Jordan and the Bulls. In 1992, The Portland Trailblazers fell victim where the league kept asking the question of who's the best shooting guard in the league. Well, after Michael Jordan hit 6/9 three pointers and scored 35 points in the 1st half setting a record for most points in a half and three pointers made in an NBA finals, that question was clearly answered. 1993 takes you to the Phoenix Suns rivalry where Jordan averaged 41 points per games winning his 3rd title getting his 1st of 2 three peats. It's a 3 disc set that chronicles Jordan's NBA career, college career and high school setbacks pushing him to this point of becoming the best. A sit down interview of Jordan's past moments and personal off the court issues such as: the media talking about his gambling, friction with teammates but the most devastating of all, the death and murder of his father, James Jordan back in 1993 that made Jordan retire from the game and live out his father's last wish of playing baseball. Jordan came back when the time was right and eventually came full circle winning his 4th championship in 1996 dedicating the win in loving memory to his father, playing through the flu in the 1997 finals pushing his team to victory vs the Utah Jazz and ending his career with the bulls hitting the game winning shot in the 1998 finals vs the Jazz yet again. This 3 disc set has Jordan's timeline from 1982-2000 of his greatest moments and highlights. it also includes 5 of his best games in their entirety: his 63 point performance vs Boston in the 1986 1st round playoffs, his 69 point career high vs Cleveland, his 55 point NBA finals game vs Phoenix, his 38 point flu game performance vs Utah and his final game with the Bulls scoring 45 hitting the game winning shot in 1998.
