8215879,5,B000UZSJIA,"I don't know what the first review is about.  This is the Haywire (rock band) greatest hits CD and DVD.  I discovered this band in a closeout bin, on a mixed CD in the early 90's, but couldn't get my hands on any more songs.  In 2008, I was on Youtube and discovered their other songs.  As a person who loves 70's & 80's rock, I was hooked.  Thank you Amazon for selling this item.  Here's the breakdown.

8215880,4,B000UZSJIA,"As a longtime lover of the old time movie stars, I could not help being drawn to this made-for-tv version ( circa 1982) of the autobiography of Brooke Hayward, daughter of actress Margaret Sullavan and Leland Hayward(both of the Hollywood Golden era). It deals primarily  with the later  life and coping of Miss Sullivan who was a beloved star of the era and endured a lifelong struggle with depression and demands of the movie industry. This wonderful story, although sad, reveals the real life of a great star and her family during her decline. I was particularly infatuated with Miss Lee Remick's portrayal of the unfortunate Sullavan. She reveals many sides of the character and relates the reality of fame and fortune. I am looking for a dvd or vhs of this movie to view again.",1190160000,,782,4.742647058823529
