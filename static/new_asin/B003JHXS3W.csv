Everything is shoot them  up, car crashes porn sex, or fantisy. This movie showed sex, but in a discret way, heck you know what they were doing! The caracters were atrective expecially Eva, beautifull, and the medical student , wow, I hope they have a lasting coreare. It's refresshing from Holywood actors. Sad thing is the good actors are not popular  in Holywood anymore. It's all the twitts that are. Acting in Holiwood is like, lame!",1373328000,,554,4.368932038834951
8398106,3,B003JHXS3W,"Well, I've certainly paid good money to see worse films.
This is not an action movie or a romantic comedy. This isn't The Notebook or anything of that type. I have not read the story/book that this film was based on. It was written by a Romanian author. The story has piqued my interest enough so that If I am able to locate copy of it in English, I will likely purchase and read it.

 I think that this film would have been better had it been in two parts, spanning 4 hours, in order to do the story real justice. I'm sure that the story was rushed in order to fit everything into the allotted time and I think it would have been a great, understated type of film if the story had been allowed to fully bloom and not rush or omit so many details. I saw many opportunities for there to be the expansion of tension, drama and mystique added to the existing story.

I felt that there was a nice sexual tension between Eva and Tudor, which I thought was pretty believable. That tension kept me interested. Eva's passion and love for Tudor was so strong that she found herself forgiving what most people would find unforgivable...Tudor's taking off for months and even years at a time without any real explanation and returning unannounced and turning things upside down. This magnetic, unexplainable attraction cannot keep them from reconnecting time after time.

The fact that Eva's estranged, much older husband, Oswald, seems to be very accepting of the situation that develops may seem unrealistic to most viewers. To spite what many ""good people"" may find to be unacceptable in most cases, may not actually be a reflection of real life and the fact that sometimes there are many shades of grey when it comes to love. Oswald releasing his hold of Eva and allowing her the freedom to follow her heart was a selfless, brave and very loving thing.

The story was written from an Eastern European perspective which may or may not have played a role in the way the characters conducted themselves in this unconventional set of fictional situations.  I think that this is a possibility that should be considered by the viewer, as well.

This is one of those stories that I wish someone would take another crack at making; because I think that the story could potentially be transformed into something unforgettable and even a wee bit haunting.",1370390400,,2338,4.619277108433735
8398107,3,B003JHXS3W,"Think ""True Lies"" except Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't find out, and they don't show you, what Arnold Schwarzenegger had been up to until the last few minutes of the film. And then, except for a 2 minute action sequence, you're only TOLD the story of what he had been doing. All-in-all not a BAD movie just a bit boring. There is a 5 minute action scene that takes place earlier in the movie but thats it until the end.",1363046400,,414,4.253164556962025
8398108,1,B003JHXS3W,"No movie description, but we get two lists lists of the two main actors.  15 min. running time... Really?  Apparently no one's minding the store.  I guess paying customers are unwanted.",1346716800,,185,4.903225806451613
8398109,1,B003JHXS3W,"Dear director/writer Popovici, have you even read the novel 'The Prodigal Son' by Radu Tudoran which you claimed you used in making this movie? Did you bother to understand it? All I can say is that you succeeded in taking a brilliant masterpiece (with reminiscences of another masterpiece 'Tess of the d'Urbervilles' by Thomas Hardy) and turned it into garbage! What a waste! I have read the book many times so far and I was waiting for a movie and when it finally came ...what a disappointment! You totally missed the point of this book, you didn't understand at all Eva's inner struggles, her eternal heartbroken state, her LOVE. And why should you? After all you are just one more poor man out there incapable of seeing/sensing the depth of a woman's soul. You dared to give him a name (by the way, 'Tudor' sounds awful in English), when he had no name in the book: it is the only thing she knows and has from him (name which could very well be yet another lie of his) and since she does not has him, she does not want to share his name with anyone. Their first meeting is electrifying, he lays down her destiny in front of her eyes and she simply follows it. This will remain however in her diary as the unhappiest day of her life! And what about his prophetic words 'I'm watching you grow'? Yes, indeed,she grows up only for him, loving him helplessly, hopelessly. The color of her hair changes as she grows, it is a wonderful symbol not only of her painful maturity but also of those unstable, terrifying war times. She is poor, she must work for a living. And the only time Eva is truly alive is when she is with him, the rest is/means nothing to her! And Eva is childless, I urge you to go and read the book and maybe this time you will be able to at least understand if not feel her infinite pain about not being able to have kids (however, in your movie, you proved to be a cruel, heartless man by presenting her as having a miscarriage, and this is because you luck the artistic ability to present the fullness of her pain, so you went for this cheap and cowardly way out!). Her husband, the boy met in Constanta (Liviu) and the family doctor (who is in fact her boss and takes on a paternal role in her life, their friendship built upon their love for music being so dear to Eva) are the only support she has and the war takes all of them away. And finally, THE KEY! When she finally realizes that he will go again, when he is on the train she asks for the key to her apartment back. This key is her freedom! He looks like is going to return the key but then the bombardment begins and everything turns into chaos and death. And Eva remains for the rest of her life the prisoner of her love for him, because she did not get that key, her life, back! She cannot leave Bucharest for America as you suggest in the move (why in the whole world would she be afraid of that outside world that she doesn't even care about and in fact hopes that will finally claim her life one day, when her biggest enemy is her own sick love for him?), she has to stay there and wait for his return ...forever! I hope that one day some other writer and director will pick up this glorious book and make it justice since you, Mr. Popovici, failed miserably.",1311811200,,3246,4.279674796747967
8398110,2,B003JHXS3W,"I watched this on Hulu on a night that I was exhausted and just vegging out. Too lazy to even get up and turn it off. I give it 2 stars because the countryside scenery was good and I liked her different hairdos and the period costumes. Shortly into the movie I was like hmmmm? when this 1930's family let the 16 yr old daughter bunk up with her older lover inside the house. Then she was on trial and there was a baron, but I didn't know where he came from. He was just there all of a sudden. He was an idiot to put up with her shenanigans and give her gobs of money. And this woman was an idiot to have the hots for this secret agent spy who left all the time without an explanation. The worst thing about this movie was the editing. I wondered if I had fallen asleep and missed chunks of the movie that left me trying to figure out what was going on. I was relieved when it was all over...zzzz.",1292457600,2,896,3.9833333333333334
8398111,1,B003JHXS3W,"This movie is going into my ever growing list of completely worthless, mentally frustrating movies to watch.  No offense to the main actors, as I believe a failed drama is often the fault of the director/producers/writers -- those people whose faces you may never see.  I feel sorry for those who wasted their time in producing this.  The story was severely disjointed, and the acting was nauseating at times and laughable at others.  I had so many moments of, Huh?  Say what? and You've got to be kidding me, while watching this.  Not worth the couple of hours I will never get back.  If only I would learn to make this judgment at the beginning and not convince myself to sit through the whole thing, hoping desperately that the miserable story and acting at some obscure and never atainable point will be redeemed. Blech.",1285286400,,824,4.680555555555555
8398112,1,B003JHXS3W,"I've just seen this movie on cable and couldn't believe how cheap a soap opera may become. It is simply awful: a most conventional story, poor performances (what is Patrick Bergin doing in this mishap?), a squeamish, boring violin music all the way through, a commonplace direction proper of a TV saga (sometimes I had the feeling that commercials were coming) and a gallery of stereotyped characters that seem to have been taken out from an old magazine for spinsters and love dreamers make this movie an unendurable experience.
Everything is over-cooked and over seen; there's no surprise in any one of the dramatic incidents; sometimes you may wonder whether some sequences were cut out since there's no clear explanation about the dramatic evolution of the characters and the development of different events. The conclusion you get by the end is that Eva is and has always been quite silly. Why didn't she do a thing after suspecting that Tudor was hiding something? The way she decides to leave her husband is also so absurd, almost funny. Was her husband a congenital imbecile? And that Tudor lover, coming and going, absent when most needed...How boring!
Unless you feel pleasure reading Danielle Steel or Corin Tellado's pink novels, avoid this. It's like watching an after-lunch, cheap melodrama (it reminded me of THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT, that horrendous soap-opera masterpiece)in which there's nothing interesting to discover. If you enjoy a good nap by midday, try this one and be sure you'll get a most pleasant and instant dream.",1282867200,,1546,5.019455252918288
