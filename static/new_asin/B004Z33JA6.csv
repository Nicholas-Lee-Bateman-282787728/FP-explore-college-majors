8449388,5,B004Z33JA6,"This TV series, which originally aired in the USA on PBS, is consistently excellent. David Suchet's Poirot characterization of Agatha Christie's fussily mannered but brilliant Belgian detective whose ""little grey cells"" work non-stop is unmatchable perfection! The supporting characters of Miss Lemon and Col. Hastings are also extremely well-portrayed.  The episodes are both intriguing, as they tell Miss Christie's stories quite faithfully, and wonderfully watchable. I enjoyed it immensely when it was on TV and was thrilled to find this collection available.  It is every bit as enjoyable now!",1352073600,,598,5.707865168539326
8449389,5,B004Z33JA6,I am a fan and can watch and rewatch the series. Great work. But region 2 only? This is foolish. Someone's grey cells were not working when they made this decision.,1326585600,14,164,4.32258064516129
