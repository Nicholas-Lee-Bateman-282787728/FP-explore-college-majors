3140835,4,B00158G8MU,"Excellent program, a no gimmick approach to improving flexibility first, strength second.

Up to 4 months ago I was a Pilates student for around 7 years, but sadly the studio I attended closed down. Roger's program mimics many of the floor exercises I did for those 7 years, with excellent attention to good form and correct breathing. I've been looking for a program that I can work out with at home, until I find a new Pilates studio to attend. Although marketed to golfers, Roger's approach would be helpful to everyone looking to improve their fitness, flexibility and posture.

Amazon appears to no longer stock this item, which is a pity from a price point of view, but it is available from [...]

The golf instruction section is relatively simplistic, but is aimed appropriately at golfers whose swing faults are often caused by either a lack of flexibility or lost flexibility and strength.

Not cheap, but for what it is, it's not horrible value either.",1259280000,4,962,4.8121212121212125
3140836,4,B00158G8MU,"If you want to improve your game flexibility is where you must focus. This program helps you do that.

Maybe a little steep in price for some but you do get alot of info. For some, maybe too much content - as we all know time is precious.

Take a close look at this one before you buy anything.

3140837,5,B00158G8MU,"This DVD series is very good and certainly will help any player of any skill level. As a low handicap, long time golfer who has for many years been interested in the physical training aspect of the swing, Roger Fredericks has been a real eye opener. A blend of unique stretches, Yoga, and breathing exercises, this program has helped loosen me up and gain 20 - 25 yards off the tee that I'd lost through inflexibility. $90. might seem like a lot to spend for a stretching program, but I look at it this way; spending the equivalent amount on lessons wouldn't have returned even 1/4 of the results I've seen through using Roger's training methods.",1141171200,5,646,4.577586206896552
3140838,5,B00158G8MU,"Flexibility is what it is all about. I have the video for about a month now. I am getting more flexible. I have a swing speed analyzer and my swing speed has gone up. I believe when Roger says flexibility separates the amatuers from the pros. When you look at a pro swing it seems so effortless. I believe instead of paying for lessons, get flexible first. If you can't afford this, get a stretching book like the Whartons.",1140739200,13,423,4.367088607594937

The stretching program starts with beginner and I was more of a beginner than I thought. The stretches take about 30 min and some are difficult to do. It would have been nice if they recommended how many times a week you should do the stretches, how long before you see progress and when you should move on to the next level(tee)",1269216000,4,472,4.5
