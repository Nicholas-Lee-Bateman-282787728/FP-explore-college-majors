8200591,5,B000RGSX10,"I've given this 5 stars only because The Long Way Home is such a wonderful movie.  Out of the Woods is one of the dullest, most boring movies I've ever seen and Follow The River is just O.K.  It's a good buy for the 3 movies and The Long Way Home was worth the price and more.",1410393600,,276,3.824561403508772

I enjoyed the movie very much. I watched the movie after reading the book, it has a very interesting twist to the ending of the movie. Would recommend both movie and book.",1235001600,2,395,7.229166666666667

8200598,4,B000RGSX10,"I found that all 3 movies were great - each in their own way.  Out of the Woods - was a heartwarming & light-hearted tale about a son reconnecting with his father.  Follow the River - a beautiful drama set in the pioneering days where a woman must use everything to protect her family & make her way home.  Finally, The Long Way Home - a heartwarming tale of 2 opposite making their way cross country for 2 different reasons.  All I would recommend.!",1220918400,8,450,4.321428571428571
