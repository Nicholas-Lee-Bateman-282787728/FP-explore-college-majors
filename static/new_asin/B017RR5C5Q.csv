7516557,4,B017RR5C5Q,The movie was good. The little girl Bella was the best thing in this film. She has a magic around her and i have started following her life and films now. Beating cancer is something very profound. I hope you make a second movie because this little girls story should be told.,1459209600,,276,4.326923076923077

7516560,2,B017RR5C5Q,"The major issue I have with the movie is that Mr. Sparrow never has to own up to his own business failings and the fact that his decisions have forced people out of work.  He tries to tell his wife, but ends up wimping out.  He is the reason Hector loses his job, but he is allowed to stay in his perfect, white, ""holy"" bubble while the stereotypical drunk Latino man fights for survival.  There is no sense of struggling with his own responsibility or guilt in the situation.  The ending has a really bizarre twist.  I wish it could have gone a different way because I really liked Anna and Maria and thought their relationship had potential for something powerful.",1464393600,,666,4.471074380165289
7516561,5,B017RR5C5Q,"I enjoyed this movie,despite the fact that Kevin Sorbo wasn't in it until near the end,but his scenes were very powerful nonetheless. I think the message of the movie is this:God will work things out for us in his time,not ours. Wholeheartedly recommend this movie for the whole family!",1464048000,5,286,4.857142857142857
7516562,2,B017RR5C5Q,"This movie is culturally disconnected as well as the many disjointed scenes. The little girl has an anglo accent and calls her dad ""papa"" and ""daddy"" with an accent as though she was a character from Little House on the Prairie. The script really should have been finely combed through to straighten out the disjointedness from one scene to another. For example, ""latina mom in kitchen with anglo friend"" to ""front lawn scene with drunk husband"". The anglo woman appears totally out of character when she stands up to the drunk husband and the latina woman who has been a strong character now appears weak. Moreover, the anglo family ""appears"" to be Christian, but yet, they are very worldly. No respect for authority from the kids, daughter wears promiscuous clothing and is concerned about her popularity, and the son is very selfish while little understanding of the Bible highlights the entire movie. The rich anglo befriending the poor latina story has potential, but this movie falls way short. Don't waste your money.",1463616000,13,1024,4.959302325581396

8740409,4,B017RR5C5Q,I am giving it 4 stars only because I have not had time to watch this movie yet. I believe it will be an excellent movie and I am looking forward to watching this movie.,1532044800,,169,3.857142857142857

8740411,2,B017RR5C5Q,I don't know why they betrayed this movie to be a Christian movie. I understand terrible things happen in life and you have to tell those stories but the whole story did not have a true plot and the acting was not that good. There was no real true message and it just seemed like someone just made a movie and wrote the script as the movie went along. The trailer makes the movie seem like it will be a good movie but beyond that movie isn't that good. I think the movie cover is very misleading and the movie was okay but not motivational. I would not buy this movie or watch it again.,1487808000,,586,4.104347826086957
8740412,2,B017RR5C5Q,"Kept waiting for the point, then the end.  Terrible acting, matching up of actors as spouses, just didn't fit.  Even Maryellen Walton as Sorbo's wife....didn't fit.",1484438400,2,164,5.269230769230769
8740413,5,B017RR5C5Q,I was hesitant to see this movie because of the situation that this family is faced with. I'm glad I gave it a chance. I see a real life story and in situations where God has His children coming alongside the hurting.,1482969600,3,217,4.190476190476191
8740414,2,B017RR5C5Q,"First thing I don't know why Kevin is placed on the front of the movie like he is a main character, when in fact he is a very very small role at the end of the movie. The thing we noticed about this film is it has no real direction or lesson or theme. The acting is pretty bad through most of the movie. If your looking for a film about Christ, this is not going to be it.",1481846400,6,372,3.721518987341772
8740415,1,B017RR5C5Q,"The message of love is priceless.  Some of the acting was on point, some sub par as expected.  What disappointed me the most about this movie was its obvious white savior theme, and I am not referring to our brown Jewish origin Christ.  I am referring to the degrading way onwhich the Latino family was portrayed, from the co-dependent mother to the weak alcoholic father to the friendless daughter vs the perfect white family who by the way sweeps in to save the day.  Typical... Disappointing. Not only is this white savior plot screamingly loud but it lacks real substance and truth. Do they really expect us to believe the father would succumb to his old addition of alcohol within such a short time or the teenage daughter would share her room without any qualms? In what world?! Oh and how annoy the adoption process taking less than two weeks, either we are discussing white privilege or this is another fake movie plot. It doesn't end there but it's not worth mentioning. I usually enjoy a good Christian movie regardless of its budget but this just plays right into the enemies hands of causing further division",1474070400,9,1120,4.698979591836735
