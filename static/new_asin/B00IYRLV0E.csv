6305391,5,B00IYRLV0E,"The acting in this film will knock your sox off! Lucas Haas is like you've never seen him before, and both the young man who plays Dusty (Blake Barris) and Necar Zadegan give star turn performances. Won't be surprised to see either of them in more to come.

Although sometimes I felt the film would verge on ""messagy,"" the performances are so strong you are with the heart-wrenching film every step of the way. A testament to Ms. Clark's sure hand with the actors. Bravo!",1402963200,6,471,4.541176470588235
6305392,5,B00IYRLV0E,I was moved by this movie in so many ways.  It is a truthful depiction of meth and the effects on the lives of those who use.  Powerful performances by an amazing cast had me completely engrossed.  I highly recommend this film to everyone!,1401494400,3,239,4.386363636363637
6305393,5,B00IYRLV0E,"I got to see this brilliant piece at the Bend Film Festival when it was in town. Although it may be a dark subject and include other socially unaccepted subjects, Jane Clark, the writer and director of Meth Head has made this film into a piece about awareness, raw human emotion, and empathy for those who have suffered or are going through addiction.

Lukas Haas has fully devoted himself into playing the main role of Kyle who is an openly gay man who gets engaged to his partner Julian (Wilson Cruz). Kyle and Julian have both had their days of fun, partying, and doing drugs and are both clean until they meet a dealer at a party; this throws Kyle into his down spiral and into his meth addiction. You follow Kyle's point of view throughout the film into his darkest days...will it end with him giving into his addiction or will he be a survivor?

This film also has a wonderful cast who seemed to have the chemistry and camaraderie of a family. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys the art of Independent Film and a storyline that is touching to the human core.",1398124800,7,1079,4.444444444444445
6305394,2,B00IYRLV0E,"This movie was just boring. it was this weird sugar-coated version of yuppy's getting there panty's in a bundle over meth. I had to stop watching it halfway through because i was just bored with the drone acting and lame story-line. If im going to watch a movie about meth; for god sake, I want a movie with guts, action, rawness. Maybe the movie got better, but I couldn't get over the yuppy's/",1447027200,2,395,4.424657534246576
6305395,5,B00IYRLV0E,"I simply Love this movie. John McLaughlin is great, Mary Jane Well,s Cathy Lynn DeBuono. It's scary with a bit of fun. Jane Clark is a wonderful filmmaker. I would follow her to the ends of the earth.",1442361600,,200,4.2894736842105265

6305397,3,B00IYRLV0E,"This movie was a bit better than I expected, but I have to give it 3 stars because it was not without some disappointments. Overall, the movie was very gritty and raw. It didn't hold back much as we watched the lives of the three main characters unravel and completely spiral out of control. I thought the performances were solid, and was especially surprised by Lukas Haas and Necar Zadegan stepping outside of their norms. The biggest disappointments for me were (minor spoiler alert) :

1. There were some holes in some of the characters storylines; such as with Maya.

2. The ending was very anticlimactic, in that it left a lot of unanswered questions and made the holes in the characters storylines bigger.

Were it not for this, this would have been a 5 star movie.",1438560000,,772,4.62043795620438

6305404,4,B00IYRLV0E,"At first it was jarring since I didn't know what to expect here but after the main characters were established I got sucked into their lives and started to feel for them. It was tragic to watch them wallow in their addiction and it's a pretty straightforward look at what this drug does to you and how it destroys people and their relationships. The relationships between the three main addicts in this movie was unlike any I've seen on film and it was really fascinating to watch it unfold. The supporting cast was definitely icing on the cake. Pinkie was a hoot!

All in all, this is a solid little indie film worth watching.",1421625600,4,627,4.5

6305406,4,B00IYRLV0E,"This movie is very realistic. I believed that these people were drug users. To that degree, it made me sad, that people would do that to them selves, and after seeing it, the question is...why would you want to?

I watched this because I am familiar with the writer producer, Jane Clark and the acting of Necar Zedagen.  I wanted to see what Jane could do as a director/writer.  This work is very real and I feel excellent. Looking forward to her next story.

Necar, convinced me, with her acting, that she was a drug addict, which made me feel sad. I have seen her in work, that made me feel joy.  If I had to chose a role for her, it would be one that brought joy.

If you enjoy good acting, and a realist story...,,watch/buy this one.",1419897600,,737,4.266187050359712

6305418,5,B00IYRLV0E,"Gave me personally a lot to think about, where applying these characters to people I have had an otherwise pleasure to have met, but for whatever reason our own lives didn't allow for us to produce a type of ""relationship"". I've seen how different people react to drug use, and my own connection to drugs, past drug use and the effect it has in highly populated areas to not so populated ones. How people close or what would seem not connected are effected by others habitual drug use.
Wish the cast and crew the best in future roles, their own paths rather!",1405728000,2,558,4.480392156862745

6305421,4,B00IYRLV0E,Reality movie that does show exactly how far people will go to get their drugs. Have seen people  go to extremes to get their drugs in my lifetime but not this extreme. Good acting by Lukas Haas as the addict.,1404000000,4,209,4.225

6305423,3,B00IYRLV0E,"I rented this because I am a Day's of Our Lives fan and Blake Berris used to play Nick on Day's.  He is in this movie.  Well the movie overall is not that great it's a good look at what happens to someone who descends into a bad meth addiction, but you can see that on shows like Drugs Inc. or Intervention.  This one really doesn't have much of a story other than the drama that comes with tweakers.",1403740800,,400,4.037974683544304

8646528,3,B00IYRLV0E,"Meth Head is the story of a young gay man Kyle, played by Lucas Haas (Witness, Inception) who takes crystal meth at a party and finds himself spiralling out of control from the addiction shortly after. His loving partner, Julius, played by Wilson Cruz (Party of Five, Red Band Society) tries desperately to save him from himself. Unfortunately, the draw of the drug and the new friends he has acquired takes him down this dark path of destruction. His new friends, Maia and Dusty, are portrayed brilliantly by Necar Zadegan (24, Elena Undone) and Blake Berris (Days of Our Lives, Crazy Bitches). The bond they all develop over the use of this life altering drug is very raw and incredibly deep. The damage that is caused is devastating. There are several supporting actors who are exceptional from Barbara Niven (Cedar Cove, A Perfect Ending) to Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down) and Theo Rossi (Sons of Anarchy). This is a very powerful film that I believe needs to be seen. Jane Clark, Writer/Director, takes you on a gritty ride into the depths of despair created by the use of crystal meth. Her careful direction allows the viewer to feel an emotional connection with Kyle. The story she has written tells an accurate account of how bad things can happen to good people through drug addiction in my opinion. I highly recommend this film. You won't be disappointed.",1520467200,,1386,4.803347280334728

8646535,1,B00IYRLV0E,"I've been impressed by Lukas Haas's acting since I was a kid and in the last couple of films I've seen him in, decided that Blake Barris'  has a real talent as well.  My impression was not changed by this film as both of them did outstanding jobs, as did most of the rest of the cast within the constraints of their roles.  The issues I had with this film, had little to do with acting...but more to do with the script, directing, and the cast selected.

The script was pretty much cookie cutter from any one of the many films dealing with addiction.  Unlike the better of these however, Meth-Head had way too many plots & sub-plots going on at the same time to do any of them justice.  Characters were not fully developed; story lines were started, went nowhere, and seemed to be more fluff to fill time, rather than to add any substance to the movie; and there were a lot of open questions and an unfinished ending.  It almost seemed the producer and/or director ran out of time (or money) to properly finish the movie.

The directing and set locations made the movie seemed more like a high-school party-flick rather than the dark, raw, unambiguous film style needed to tell a story of this type.  There was drug use but it was tempered; there was sex with no nudity (I mean who has sex with their clothes on??); there was male-prostitution but the scenes appeared to be filmed by a homaphobe who really didn't' want to do them; and the violence seemed to be more of an after thought, rather than something needed to support the movie.

Finally, although I like Lukas and Blake, I'm not sure why they, and many of the actors were selected for this movie.  I think they were going for the age range of the characters to be mid-20s, but everyone appeared to be in the mid, to late 30s.  Blake, came the closest to matching his role, but his girlfriend looked like she was in her 40s.  When I first saw her, I thought she was his mother.  Lukas' age is showing and he really did look like he was his true age (near 40), rather than 20-something.  His boyfriend did look closer to the correct age range, but the dynamic between then was weird and didn't work so I didn't want to see them together...it was painful.  And come on!!! Lukas is far to heavy to be a meth-head, I mean he looked like he actually gained weight during the movie, rather than loosing any...which is what you'd expect to happen if he was addicted.  Blake, on the other hand, looked like he actually dropped weight for the moving (which he didn't need to do cause he's already pretty thin as it is).  The remaining cast was largely unmemorable, as was the interactions between them.  During the moving I felt no emotion for any of them, and was looking forward to the end.  I made a commitment that I'd watch the whole movie, which I did.

So all in all, Meth-head could have been much more enjoyable...with different direction, script, and cast.  But It fell short on so many levels that 1 is the best I can do.",1449878400,,2983,4.395264116575592
8646536,5,B00IYRLV0E,Very good film first film about this topic that gets it right in every way,1449532800,,74,4.0
