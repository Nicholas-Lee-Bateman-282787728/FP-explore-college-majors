Occasionally (almost tangentally) socially relevent-ish, surreal, etc. A riot even when removed  from its cultural context --- not an easy feat. Not for linear thinkers.",914371200,,284,5.604651162790698

7864460,5,6304154267,"Really violent slapstick has always worked best when there is absolutely no indication that the participants enjoy each other's company in the slightest .  This show works as a sort of capsule of social darwinism--every man is out to serve his own best interests.  That they all live together in the same dilapidated house is simply brilliant.
This is the ugliest program I've ever obsessed over.  Honestly, these characters are refugees from a cartoon made by illustrators on really hard drugs.
CASH
This one is highlighted by antics of two headless aristocrats who lose their heads yet again and boogie about casa de Scumbag.  Vyvyan turns cheeky scoring cups of sugar from his sexy, flatulent neighbor.  Then he goes and gets himself knocked up. The boys are so broke that Neil becomes a fascist pig and everything gets really heavy for a bunch of drug casualties.  Alexei Sayle is again brilliant as a police commander who is always being mistaken for Benito Mussolini (and his subsequent performance as Il Duce singing ""Stupid Noises"" for a talent show defies description.)
INTERESTING
Dawn French is dead sexy as a Jesus-hungry yokel. Rick turns into a fascist and won't let any of his early guests have any fun at all at the party. The hippy gets really high and literally goes into outer space. Vyv turns into Mr. Atlas to impress a couple of birds. The party kicks on and loads of ugly people show up.  Alexei Sayle plays Tommy Balowski, who comes to the party drunk.  ""Are you a virgin"", he says to Neil at the party.  ""I'm not asking you.  I'm just using that as a general term of abuse.""  This is one of my least favourite episodes. Rick is even more annoying than usual and Vyv doesn't smash enough things up.
SUMMER HOLIDAY
This is one of the best episodes and also the last. One of the best bits is the afro-hitler postal man delivering the lads' dismal test results. REALLY funny.  There's  ""cricket"" in the house and Elephant Head singing a bit of ""Stop! In the name of love""  Alexei Sayle is hilarious as Jrzy Balowski coming to bust some heads and toss our  boys out into the street.  Desperation takes hold and the only thing left to do is take it to the establishment. So our Scumbags pretend to rob the Fascist Pig Bank with water pistols--just when an actual bank robber is being led to the back to fill his coffers with cold hard cash. The end result is that the whole lot turn into stinking hippies riding about in a stolen double decker bus.  The finale is fitting.",1087084800,2,2491,4.599547511312217
7864461,5,6304154267,"My wife introduced me to these maniacs years ago, and I'm still hooked. These three episodes are among the best.
CASH--After Neil announces that there's a ""poltergoost"" in the house, the lads realize that things aren't really just disappearing: they are being burned for firewood. The cash just isn't there. After composing (and fortunately burning) a letter to Neil's bank manager, Vyv announces his delicate condition and Neil is selected to become the breadwinner. How? By joining the police department. The episode turns upon itself several times with hilarious effect. This is truly among the best. (NB--An all-star new wave supergroup performed Dylan's ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"", when my wife taped it years ago. However, the scene doesn't appear on this tape! Must've been a copyright issue.)
INTERESTING--Actually, this is truly among the best also. The boys throw a house party, and the cameos abound. Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, and the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie are hysterical party-crashers who run into Santa Claus and a nineteenth century chimney sweep. Oh, and Neil flies passed the Space Shuttle and encounters aliens. Typical party for the lads.
SUMMER HOLIDAY--The weakest of the three, and it's still incredibly funny. This finale to the show features Mr. Balowski evicting the boys, a night spent sleeping in the streets, and a bank robbery that features a bimbo teller who only knows how to say, ""Good morning, how can I help you?"" And Rik finally runs into Cliff Richards, but not in the way he wanted to.
Another terrific trio of comedy.",1086566400,4,1603,5.145593869731801
7864462,4,6304154267,"The Young Ones epitomised the confusion of the generation that came of age in the Thatcher Years. Caught between a right wing government, the residue of punk and left-wing ideas from the 60s and 70s, and the continued disolution of the class system, British youth went through an identity crisis, struggling to find a suitable sub-group to belong to, whether it be punk (Vyv), spiv (Mike), hippy (Neil), or 'right-on' left-wing radical (Rick). Throwing these 4 student-types together in an anarchic, surreal house-share was a stroke of genius.
The main focus is the explosive relationship of the pretentious Rick (Rik Mayall) and the brutally straightforward Vyvian (Adrian Edmonson). These 2 actors later reprised a stripped down version of this relationship in ""Bottom"". Neal the Hippie and Mike the Spiv provided useful ballast and a wider range of plot options preventing this central comedic relationship from imploding.
People who saw the Young Ones the first time round tend to remember it as much funnier than it really is. With repeated viewing the some of the weaknesses in the writing become apparent. Nevertheless there is also a lot of comedic genius and an anarchic spirit that remains eternally refreshing.",1055203200,2,1221,5.2030456852791875

7864464,5,6304154267,"A spectacular trio of episodes from the 80s British comedy series THE YOUNG ONES, starring Rik Mayall, Ade Edmondson, Nigel Planer, Christopher Ryan and Alexi Sayle.  This tape features shows from both the 1982 and 1984 season, primarily notable the last episode of the series, SUMMER HOLIDAY.
CASH - (1984 season) - Neil has to become a pig because the boys don't have any bread and Vyvyn is going to have a baby.  Mike nails his legs to the table.  Rik gets a wacking great splinter up his bottom.  A supergroup including Glenn Tillbrook, Jools Holland and Stewart Copeland sing Dylan's ""Subterranean Homesick Blues.""
INTERESTING - (1982 season) - The boys have a party.  Neil insists he has a friend, if only they can find him.  Giant sandwiches fall from the sky.  Vyvyn invents great new party games.  Mike gets the girl.  Rik is out of control as usual.  Jennifer Saunders makes a guest appearance.  Musical guests are Rip, Rig and Panic, featuring a young Neneh Cherry, singing ""You're My Kind of Climate.""
SUMMER HOLIDAY - (1984 season) - In the series finale, the boys learn that Rik's parents are dead and then they get thrown out of their house.  Will a sudden heist fix their problems?  Guest appearance by Lenny Henry as the fascist mailman.  The musical guest is John Otway singing ""Body Talk.""",1027123200,4,1308,4.7555555555555555
7864465,5,6304154267,"THE YOUNG ONES episodes, CASH, INTERESTING and SUMMER HOLIDAY is the final volume in THE YOUNG ONES episode collection and it is definetly one of the best collections of they're shows, after BAMBI, NASTY, and TIME.  Punk  Vyvian, whiner Rick, hippie Neil and schemer Mike all return for another  batch of manic hilarity.  All of the episodes are side splittingly funny  and are required for anybody who is a fan of Brittish television.  CASH has  the boys burning they're precious possesions in the Winter time for warmth  since they're out of money and then force Neil to get a job when Vyvian  makes a rather important and unusal announcement.  In INTERESTING Mike is  throwing a party which, after the pub closes, turns into a free-for-all  blowout.  The scene where Rick finds a ""present"" in Jennifer  Saunder's purse in this episode by itself is a laugh riot.  Finally in  SUMMER HOLIDAY, the term is over and the boys are bored with nothing to do  but set Rick on fire, ruin Neil's birthday and demolish the living room and  kitchen.  THE YOUNG ONES is quite possibly one of the best shows on  television that was ever made, why aren't shows this good today?",957830400,8,1164,4.696517412935323
7864466,5,6304154267,"""The Young Ones"" was a groundbreaking TV show from Britain in the early '80s.  Created, written, & performed by a group of comedians from England's ""alternative"" comedy scene, it centered around the  misadventures of four ill-matched roomies all attending Scumbag College:  the trendy Leftist (and complete moral coward) Rik Turpin (Rik Mayall); the  violent Punker with the metal-studded forhead, Vyvyan Basterd (Adrian  Edmondson); the lewd, manipulative, scheming pint-sized Cockney hustler  Mike ""the Cool Person"" (Christopher Ryan); and the downtrodden,  morose hippie Neal Pye (Nigel Planer).  They were joined every week by  their zany, Eastern-European landlord, Mr. Balowski (Alexei Sayle, who also  played any number of Mr. Balowski's relatives).  A stream-of-consciousness  sitcom loaded with rude, outrageous slapstick humor, it featured guest  appearances by other great Brit comedians [Jennifer Saunders  (""Absolutely Fabulous""), Dawn French (""French &  Saunders""), Stephen Fry & Hugh Laurie (""A Bit of Fry &  Laurie""), Emma Thompson (""Sense & Sensibility""), Robbie  Coltrane (""Cracker""), and Mel Smith & Griff-Rhys Jones  (""Alas Smith & Jones"")].  It was written by Mayall, Lise  Mayer, and Ben Elton (Elton also having written ""The Black Adder""  series, among others).  Sandwiched into the crazed comedy were musical  spots from well-known pop acts of the eighties (Dexy's Midnight Runners,  Madness, Motorhead, etc.).  Thrown in some puppets, explosions, living  fairy tales, random acts of comic violence, time-space juxtapositions,  commentaries from God, and copious flatulence jokes, and you have the  funniest TV show of all time... one which would never be gotten away with  on American TV.  Screened from time to time of Comedy Central & MTV,  here they all are in the original, uncut (yes, they were censored from time  to time for U. S. viewers) versions!  Buy them all and laugh your bollocks  off!",940377600,19,1925,5.592334494773519
