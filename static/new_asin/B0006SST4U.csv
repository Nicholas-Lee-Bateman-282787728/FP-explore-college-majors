8043145,5,B0006SST4U,"""El Polaquito"" is a powerful film in the tradition of ""Salaam Bombay,"" in it's tale of street kids surviving while living in Buenos Aires Central Station.  Young actor Abel Ayala, who plays the title character, makes the film, with his funny smile and beautiful and natural performance, and Marina Glazer is unforgettable as the sweet but hardened young prostitute that steals the heart of Pola.  A sad and dark tale of brutality, that focuses on the more sinister and corrupt people of society, who use and exploit the innocent for their own personal gain.  But there are many scenes of optimism and of joy, and it is amazing to see how nothing seems to break the spirit of Pola, as he struggles to survive, and to protect his girl from the ruthless pimp that controls both of their fates.  ""El Polaquito"" is wonderfully filmed as well, so it is important to get this Region 2 release, as it preserves the films widescreen ratio, and is a superior picture quality in general.  The region 1 release is ok, but it is pan/scan format, and takes away from the quality somewhat; this explains the difference in price.  The more expensive Region 2 edition is the one to get.",1276560000,3,1169,4.650485436893204
8043146,5,B0006SST4U,"""El Polaquito"" is a heartbreaking story about a 13 year old boy (Abel Ayala) who hustles on the streets and trains of Buenos Aires to earn a few pesos.  Polaquito's particular gig is singing tangos on the trains that run out of the Constitucin railway station.  What he lacks in voice, he makes up for with a 1000 watt smile and a winning personality.  On a good day he earns about 20 pesos. But when Polaquito gets off the train his boss, El Rengo, is there to meet him and take every centavo.  Rengo (Rolly Serrano), is a low level manager in a bigger organization of Mafioso and dirty cops.  His job is to befriend desperate young kids from the slums.  He promises to help them make money, and then sets them up as beggars or prostitutes.  Once he has them, it's almost impossible for the kids to get away.

When Polaquito meets La Pelu (Marina Glezer), a girl only a few years older than himself, he is completely smitten with her.  Since Pelu is also working for Rengo, Polaquito decides it is up to him to protect her and find a way out for both of them.

What makes this film so touching is that, despite being brutalized by almost everyone he meets, Polaquito retains a generally positive outlook.  Even though he is just another of the uneducated, unskilled slum kids hustling to make a peso, he has an inner nobility.  Unfortunately, at 13 there isn't much he can do to fight back.

The cast is very strong, but the stand out is Abel Ayala.  Ayala is incredibly moving in the title role as a sweet kid in very bad circumstances.  About ten minutes into the film I wanted to draw up adoption papers and take him away from that life.

Although well told, this is a dark and depressing film based on a true story.  The film is excellent, but proceed with caution.  This story will stay with you.

The DVD has scene selection, optional English subtitles, and trailers.",1241913600,,1874,4.442815249266862
8043147,4,B0006SST4U,"""El Polaquito,"" which I've seen translated as ""The Little Polish"" & ""The Polish Singer,"" is a gritty film about street kids.  Argentine director Juan Carlos Desanzo has sympathy for his subjects.  Abel Ayala won a Best Actor Award from New York LaCinemaFe for his work in the main role.  He's a sensitive kid that tries to find his way in the rough world where children are viewed as moneymakers by their Mafia boss.  Ayala sings with great bravado on the trains and picks up change from the travelers.  Marina Glezer plays Pelu, a young prostitute who seems to still have a childish sense of fun.  She has appeared in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Motorcycle-Diaries-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B0006Z2LOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Motorcycle Diaries (Full Screen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and won Best Actress awards for this film from the Montreal World Film Festival & the Argentinean Film Critics Association Awards.  As Pelu, she realizes her circumstances in the world & adapts without sentimentality.  Ayala believes that she is carrying his child and sets on an improbable but valiant plan to have them move to Brazil where they can raise their baby.  Ayala's friend Vieja is played by newcomer Fernando Roa who boasts & brags.  Rolly Serrano plays Rengo, the Mafia representative who brutally must keep the children's respect in order to make money from them.  A moving moment in the film is when Ayala tries to protect Pelu from a policeman seeking her services and himself winds up violated by the cop on the train car floor.  This film has no happy endings.  It does show that even in the poorest youths made to grow up quickly, there can still be admirable qualities of hope and courage.

8043148,5,B0006SST4U,"Juan Carlos Desanzo wrote (with Lito Espinosa) and directed this fine film that relates a true story about a 13-year-old kid called El Polaquito (Abel Ayala) who was murdered by the underground in the tawdry, crime-infested backstreets of Buenos Aires.  The miracle of this tough film is in the extraordinary acting by the young lad Abel Ayala who had no previous acting experience, was simply a homeless youth from the streets, but who gives one of the most galvanizing portraits on film.

It is Buenos Aires in the late 1990s and El Polaquito makes his living singing tangos in the style of El Polanco on the commuter trains.  His hand to mouth existence is fostered by 'Limp', the pimp/agent/boss of the Mafia in control of his neighborhood.  El Polaquito, only 13, watches beautiful girls, longing to end his virginity but terrified because of his inexperience and his lack of family to inform him.  He falls in love with La Pelu (Marina Glezer), a 16-year-old prostitute, also working for the Mafia controlling child exploitation in one of Argentina's busiest train stations.

It is this transformation that occurs when El Polaquito and La Pelu become lovers that encourages El Polaquito to defy Limp and the rest of the Mafioso in an attempt to escape to what he thinks is La Pelu's safe haven - Brazil, the land of her loving father. Danger floods the streets and at the point when El Polaquito has enough money to escape to Brazil, La Pelu tells him there is no such haven. El Polaquito meets his end in a manner that is still to this day called a suicide by the police of Argentina.  We are allowed to see the truth and the truth is not an aspect of a review to share.

The camera work and the sound and music are as gritty as the story.  The supporting cast (Fabin Arenillas, Fernando Roa, Rolly Serrano, and Osvaldo Sanders, especially) is consistently strong.  What saves this little film from being just another sad tale of the homeless kids of big cities is the enormously important character created by Abel Ayala, whether optimistically singing tangos on the trains for coins, or for his tender relationship with Marina Glezer, or fighting on the streets - all are done with utter honesty and conviction that the viewer is unable to avoid connecting in the strongest way with his El Polaquito.  Highly recommended.  In Spanish with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, April 05",1112659200,5,2388,4.766990291262136
