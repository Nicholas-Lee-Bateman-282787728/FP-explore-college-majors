8084139,3,B000BB18KO,Got it on time with no problems. I am rating this three stars not because of the seller but because the series itself is lacking a good plot. Despite being a yaoi there is no real romance with the main couple. The anime is so short that it lacks any real development in the relationship with the main couple. While sora and fujimori's relationship does get a little better to the point that they can tolerate each other there is really no real romance till closer to the final few episodes.,1484611200,,490,4.395604395604396
8084140,3,B000BB18KO,"When I first purchased this DVD, the description was ""BRAND NEW. STILL IN ITS WRAPPING"" or something like that. I was so disappointed when I got this DVD. Even though it was still in its wrapping, the disc was NOT brand new. The disc was all scratched up in the middle, and when I played the disc it would skip.",1390953600,,311,4.2
8084141,1,B000BB18KO,DVD comes with no english subtitle.  This seems to be an oversight with vol. 2.  Vol 1 & 3 have no problem. I have bought multiple copies of vol. 2 and none of them have english subtitle. There is no set up menu to turn on subtitle.,1351123200,2,232,3.9148936170212765
8084142,4,B000BB18KO,"This is a great Shounen-ai anime to have, not too short or long. The artwork is pretty, the characters endearing, the Japanese vocal cast excellent and the story sublime though needs a bit of time to get into. There is humour, drama, mystery and of course it is boys' love. I personnally prefer the love between the 2 teachers than between the 2 protagonists. I have watched the whole series in Chinese sub and was taken by surprise by the turning points in the series, which give this whole story a different perspective. I do not wish to give any spoiler away but the story is much more than it first appears. You either like the turn of events or be disappointed. I was pleasantly surprised though could not help feeling a trifle betrayed. The initial direction of the story is much more romantic.",1136592000,3,800,4.5625
