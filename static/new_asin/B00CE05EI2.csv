8580703,5,B00CE05EI2,Thank you MovieEnt for making this Philippine TV series available on Amazon.  We could not follow the series due to our hectic schedule but now we do.  It's fun to watch Maya (Jodi Sta. Maria) and Richard (Richard Yap) in their many escapades.  Highly recommended for family viewing.,1368230400,2,283,4.854166666666667
