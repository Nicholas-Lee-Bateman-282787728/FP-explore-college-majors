6248157,3,B00I3HFB24,"The Stranger is perhaps the most uninteresting movie of the lot. As you progress thru this set though, the 2nd movie (Hunt to Kill) is better than the first, the third movie (The Package) much better than the first two and the final movie (Maximum Conviction) the best of them all. However, the 4th movie in my opinion would more so be classified as a Seagal movie rather than an Austin movie, which is fine.
Picture quality of the first is so/so while the other 3 are very good. Audio is all over the place though. For starters the packaging is wrong as it incorrectly indicates that the whole package is all the same format. One has PCM, the others have Dolby True HD. Except for the lack of low frequency rumble the audio on these is more than sufficient. Is it an Anchor Bay thing to not offer deep bass?",1405728000,7,808,4.357615894039735
6248158,3,B00I3HFB24,"Steve Austin has now turned from pro wrestling to action hero. I enjoyed how he underplays his roles, just the opposite of his over the top wrestling persona.. If you like Austin I believe you will enjoy these action movies. Not great films but since I like the actors I was able to menjoy the films.",1402704000,3,300,4.375
6248159,3,B00I3HFB24,"Maximum Conviction:
Cross (Steven Seagal) & Manning (Steve Austin) are former special forces agents who are assigned to close down a secret high security prison still filled with hostile prisoners while at the same time taking in two new female prisoners for the night named Samantha Mendez (Steph Song) & Charlotte Walker (Aliyah O'Brien) who have a mysterious past. When Cross goes to spends some time with other members of his team at the bar, Manning runs into Max (Teach Grant) who's having some issues with the trash compressor causing them to be delayed overnight while a Marshall Prisoner Transfer Unit lead by Chris Blake (Michael Pare) arrives to take the women only to no avail causing them to become hostile & take Warden Samuels (Ian Robinson) while also invading throughout the prison revealing themselves to be actually mercenaries who want the girls by any means necessary before Cross returns to not only see everything going on causing him to go retrieve the girls, who he doesn't know if he can trust, but also see that the hostile inmates have also been released.

The Package:
Steve Austin plays Tommy Wick, an ex-combat veteran, who's a nightclub bouncer & enforcer for Seattle mob boss Big Doug (Eric Keenleside) who's stuck in this type of life with his wife Darla (Kirstien Kerr) because of the limited employment & financial stability with his military background. Big Doug gives Tommy & his partner Julio (Mike Dopud) an assignment to deliver a package to a man who he's had a past with called ""The German"" (Dolph Lundgren), a violent crime lord himself, with the payoff being that Tommy clear the debt owed to Doug by his jailed brother Eddie (Lochlyn Munro) but runs into problems along with way with a group of mercenaries, lead by Devon (Darren Shahlavi) along with Monique (Monique Ganderton) & Ralph (Peter Bryant), come after him after being hired by Anthony (Michael Daingerfield) to get the package while also sending his men after his rival crime boss ""The German.""

Hunt To Kill:
Steve Austin multi-picture deal with Anchor Bay films has resulted in another direct to DVD feature here in ""Hunt To Kill."" Austin stars as a Jim Rhodes, a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Montana, who has his daughter with him on Winter vacation with them having a strained relationship. She gets caught shoplifting & is being held in the local sheriff's office for him to come pick her up. Meanwhile a band of robbers in Las Vegas were betrayed by one of their own members of the team who takes off with all the loot leading the head villian Banks (Gil Bellows) to the same Sheriff's office where Rhodes & his daughter is. From there, Rhodes is forced to lead the band of criminals throught the wilderness with so many issues being dealt with such as the villians turning on each other, his daughter being held hostage while she's still having issues & conflict with him, and just trying to survive in the wild.

The Stranger:
Steve Austin's third starring role has him as a former F.B.I. agent who had gone rouge & is now hunted by not only the F.B.I. but also the Russian mob due to him being involved with a top-secret investigation that revolved around an internal mole & a hidden amount of money...with him having no clue why due to him having his memory blocked past a few quick unclear flashes of various things like a little girl & a briefcase. The main people looking for him is his psychologist Grace (played by Erica Cerra) who attempts to help figure out what is blocked from his memory & F.B.I. agent Mason Reese (played by Adam Beech) who has a past with both characters & has his own motives for helping restore his memory.

""Maximum Conviction"" was the movie you would expect from these two names with their reputation in that it had all sorts of action from fist fighting to heavy gun play (the DVD cover alone shows that) with everyone playing their part well with Austin still doing his ""dry humor"" from time to time to keep it entertaining as well.  ""The Package"" was probably the most unique movie story wise that Austin has done to date as despite the fact that both men were linked together throughout the whole movie, it was telling two individual stories of Wick & ""The German"" dealing with the hits put out on each guy by the same boss as they didn't cross paths with each other throughout most of the movie with the action was what you expect as you had some fist fighting but mostly based on gun play while Austin did his usual ""dry humor"" with one liners from time to time that did make you laugh.  ""Hunt To Kill"" had most of the action in this movie consist of using weapons (shooting weapons like guns & a crossbow) along with an explosion & some stunts but there are two fights with one being between Rhodes & Banks along with one of two mini reunions from the ""Expendables"" movie with Austin's character fighting Gary Daniels' character of Jensen but as the plot was very basic with some of the characters were too ""cartoonish"" for my taste & none of the action here really got an emotion out me.  ""The Stranger"" was trying to be sold as an action movie but most of the action (which is limited to a few chase scenes) takes a backstage to a heavy amount of dialog & storytelling which is a heavy disappointment as it just didn't balance & it got annoying with the heavy amount of on & off flashbacks throughout the film with the movie just came off more as a 88 minute background story strictly to setup the future sequels which made this movie easily forgettable once I finished watching it to the point where if you notice, I don't even mention the name of Austin's character but I don't remember it.  In then end, I really enjoyed half of the movies on here while the other two were just watchable at best but your getting four for the price of one so it's a collection I recommend for fans of Steve Austin's acting career.",1399852800,3,5874,4.598282442748092

8638633,5,B00I3HFB24,"I bought these to watch with my Dad. We really enjoy these Steve Austin movies. They have a fast pace and lots of action. These are probably direct to Blu-ray releases, or made for television movies. It's not fair to compare them to major studio releases like Braveheart and Gladiator. Additionally, I really like the Steelbook packaging. Each movie is on a separate Blu-ray disk. Each disk has it's own holder in the case.

Someone mentioned poor video and audio quality. The movies look and sound great on my 55"" Samsung television and Onkyo soundbar. Maybe you will notice imperfections if you have an 80"" 4K television and state of the art surround sound system with crazy bass. For the average consumer, the quality should not be an issue.",1438646400,4,744,4.767441860465116
