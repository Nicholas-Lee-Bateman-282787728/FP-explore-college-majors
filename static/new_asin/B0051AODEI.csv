8452493,1,B0051AODEI,"This DVD was very disappointing, if I would have known it was mostly night hunting I would have NOT bought it. Predator hunting DVD's do NOT need to have loud wild music sound tracks playing in the back ground, people want to hear the calling and animal sounds that are taking place. Sorry Fox Pro, I do have one of your callers and it works ok some of the time, but this DVD was so bad I couldn't even finish it.",1329523200,,413,4.111111111111111
