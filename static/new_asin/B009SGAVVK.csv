8544084,5,B009SGAVVK,I am a Rurouni Kenshin fan and I greatly enjoyed this show.  It was a lot of fun to watch.,1365033600,,90,3.5
8544085,5,B009SGAVVK,"But it's a gorgeous movie, and we plan to convert it to digital and add subtitles (these can be found on the web - we don't speak Japanese).

We saw this on a plane and were disappointed we could not really see it because the seat back screens were so small and washed out.  This is not as lush as Hero, but in many ways equally good.  I like the fight scenes better because they seem less stylized.  Obviously, it has a kind of anime feel to the story line and shots, but I didn't immediately catch onto that (not being aware that it was anime first).  The movie stands well on its own and is a joy to watch on a large screen.",1362960000,2,627,4.024193548387097
8544086,5,B009SGAVVK,very much alike to the series but still not the same. Those hardcore fans can tell is not the same. Still is a great job.,1360800000,,121,3.88
8544087,5,B009SGAVVK,Great movie! It really gave justice to the anime version. Fantastic! Had so much fun watching from beginning till end.,1359936000,,118,4.95
8544088,5,B009SGAVVK,"Very well packed and arrived in time and perfect conditions.
Just what I was expecting a great movie totally in japanese, it will be excelent training!",1359331200,,151,4.846153846153846
8544089,5,B009SGAVVK,"As a die hard fan of the anime I thought this was just going to be random fight scenes jumping from one to the next. The story might not be exactly the same as the anime and manga, but the story of this is great and the way the characters are tied together is pretty well executed. I was also scared this was going to try and sum up the whole anime story but it doesn't. Just pretty much the story up through the Jinei arc and little bit of ova / Samurai X. Also you'll probably still love Sanoske :D hopefully English subbed blu ray makes it way here to NA / Amazon soon. I've also heard its a pretty good movie if you have no kenshin background...and also a pretty bad movie if you have no kenshin background.",1357862400,7,711,4.085714285714285
8544090,5,B009SGAVVK,"I saw this movie at the cinema and enjoyed it immensely. As a fan of the anime, it stays reasonably true to the first season of Ruroni Kenshin, however, my wife saw it with me and really enjoyed it as a stand alone movie with slick styling and minimal wire fighting. The sets are stunning and the pace is good with moments of levity that avoid the film becoming just another sword flick.
The only disappointment is that this version does not seem to include English subtitles, so if you're not fluent in Japanese, you'll get nothing out of the film.
I'm sure there'll be an English version soon, wait for it and then do yourself a favour and buy it.",1356566400,28,649,4.371900826446281
