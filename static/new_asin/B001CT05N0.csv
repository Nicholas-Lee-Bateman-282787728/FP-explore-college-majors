who is amos lassen,  and how does he rate items before the dvd is released.
  i have bought several items based on his recommedations.
all of them have been glowing 5 *  reviews, but when you get the
dvd that is released to the public, it seems that at least 20% of the
movie that he describes is not in the on the dvd.
  i won't be buying anything he reviews glowingly until i see a few more
opinons, or i can rent it first
Sad, but somewhere the movies he is seeing and what is released is
just not the same.  NOW on to the movie i received ,++Yes this is sterotypcial, good guys and not so good guys, but remember, the wrong thing about being """"gay""""  is we love MEN,  and that makes it

3517642,4,B001CT05N0,"Writer/Director Rob Williams has a special insight about life, love and relationships that bring the characters and plots of his movies to life with reality. The GuestHouse boys chose the right actors for the parts in ""3-Day Weekend"" making the film even more believable.

3517643,4,B001CT05N0,"Longtime couple Simon and Jason, along with their friend Cooper and his current ""boy"" Ace, decide to spend a ""3 Day Weekend"" (2008) at their luxurious cabin in the mountains, and each invites along a single friend to make it interesting.  There's a former college roommate, a nude yoga instructor and a shy nerd co-worker.  Also a high-paid callboy, who actually knows three of the others through his work.

It's a film about gay male relationships, borrowing a bit of the dynamic from both ""Love! Valour! Compassion"" and ""Boys In The Band,"" and actually does a good job briefly tackling such topics such as ageism, monogamous vs ""open"" relationships, how having come-of-age during the worst of the AIDS epidemic has affected gay baby boomers, self-image and spirituality.  There's the drama of a relationship falling apart, and the joy of another one beginning, right before their eyes. That's a lot to cram into 84 minutes, and, as a result, the plot is somewhat light overall, although the acting is above average, the production values and direction excellent for a low budget gay film.  DVD includes extensive extras, including deleted and extended scenes, bloopers, music video, director commentary and cast interviews. A pleasant diversion, which I give four stars out of five.",1226707200,5,1284,5.095238095238095

Add some lame dramatic twist, lots of talking about one's feelings, some nudity, and shake. Check, check, check, and more stirred than shakened. The pacing and production felt more like a high school play than a movie with everyone taking turns to say their lines. You've been on this trip before.

3517645,4,B001CT05N0,"Just the right guy and just the wrong guy get found as ""3 Day Weekend"" takes a snapshot of men in various states of monogamy, marriage, momentary pleasure, and seperation.

The gorgeous ""Weekend"" gleefully admits that it is a thinly veiled homage to eight-gay-men-sitting-around-a-nice-house genre ""The Boys in the Band"" (1970) and ""Love! Valour! Compassion!"" (1997). But hey, fill a million dollar hunting lodge in SoCal with a 45-year-old muscle bear (Derek Long), a closeted 25-year-old self proclaimed ""geek"" (Chris Carlisle), and six male model types of various ages in between and you've got the makings of a party.

Take two couples -- one intergenerational, the other in an open relationship -- who take an annual weekend in the country and let them mix in their allegedly single friends for a change of pace. The secrets fly fast and furiously thanks to the invitation of Andre, a male hustler (Daniel Rhyder), that at least five of the guests already know. Buddhism translates to both a lust for life and an inability to button a shirt; turnabout becomes the most unfair play for a duo turned trio; the ambition to be paid to break hearts proves tempting; and with the exception of one or two characters who just don't seem to have any material whatsoever, Rob Williams' writing and direction soar. The assembled ensemble rises and shines. -- Thomas Heald, Pridelets.com",1225065600,32,1380,4.995652173913044

3517672,1,B001CT05N0,"Sorry to report that watching this a second time a few years after the first was just as bad. This s a pretty poor movie. It could have been good -- maybe with a good editing and an out-loud read thru. Much of the dialogue, which should have been good, was just stilted--unreal. Most of the actors were anything but, we're talking middle-school level, but most were very attractive and we get to see most of them naked or close to. Daniel Rhyder as the male prostitute was a poor choice. I wouldn't pay him. He's not ugly, but he's skinny and shapeless and why pay someone like that for sex? A far better choice would have been the actor--Joel Harrison--that played Cameron, a gorgeous young hunk with an amazing body (who was also a far better actor). The movie was very very preach-ie. I don't mind a message, but for goodness sake, 100 messages shoved down my throat every other minute in fortune cookie language just got boring. It is a ""talking heads"" movie. I didn't believe these were real people, just puppets to deliver the author's message--and that get's boring instead of meaningful. So much was just totally unbelievable. The characters all speak the same with the same voices, even though they are supposed to be different people. The soundtrack is pretty wretched. It is stuffed with lousy un-funny lines and cliches, like: ""It's a business doing pleasure with you,"" and lots and lots of ""come/cum"" jokes. Oh well, nothing is perfect.

3517673,3,B001CT05N0,"not sure what it says about our culture that the man paid for sex is the least attractive in this movie, kind of reminded me of Robert Redford in Brubaker when he's the cutest one in a prison movie but he doesn't get raped. I think here, the characters seem a little stereotypical but less than in most gay movies and the main characters have a lot to do and many other characters to do it with. I think there might have been more emphasis on back stories as some characters seemed to have a lot and some had none but that added to a sense of mystery and intrigue that spending three days in a house on top of each other might normally lack. I liked the hot tub sequence and how they were checking each other out without checking each other out.

The dialogue is trite, the editing is too slow - there's about half a second too long between every single line of the film, as if the director wanted to give time for the audience to receive the importance of the words.  A round-table conversation where the characters discuss how poorly gay men are represented in film would have to rank as one of the most savagely ironic moments in modern film history.

Really poor acting, totally miscast actors and every negative stereotype (ageism, non-monogamous, gym obsessed and brainless) perpetuated about gay men. The plot was totally boring and you can see that the actors are just trying to get through this disaster and move on with their lives.

3517677,4,B001CT05N0,"I liked this show. In fact, I've watched it twice now which shows that I really do like it (many such movies I only see once). I buy the ones I really like.

Good things about the show: writing is good, acting is rather good, production values are OK (relatively speaking), and the show actually has something to say to a variety of sub-audiences who might see it (meaning there is a wide spectrum of types and interests depicted in the film which adds to its interest value for the sub-types of gay men who might see it).

Bad things about the show: writing could be better (and the story expanded a bit), and more money would have helped polish the show (particularly the music used) and thus made it more than a B-minus film.

I won't recount the story or comment on the amount of ""naked skin"" because other reviewers have done that. I will just say that I rather liked this movie and would recommend that others buy it.",1295481600,3,923,4.385964912280702

3-Day Weekend is defined by painful, lengthy monologues about GBLT issues, a male escort who's supposed to be hot as hell yet resembles Ellen Degeneres in 20 years after a bad crystal meth addiction, and actors who stand awkwardly about waiting for the next guy to say his line.

It's bad. Not even Dante's Cove bad: that, at least, falls into the so-bad-it's-good category. 3-Day Weekend is a frustrating, boring waste of time.

Put eight gay men into one log cabin, and have all the stereotypical gay neurosis emerge. The acting was stoic, at times forced, with almost every character having been ill considered in both concept, casting and dialog. Scenes felt forced, and whilst there were moments of excellent scripting, the actors failed horribly in delivering the content in a manner which I expect the writer had originally envisaged.

The sex and nudity was gratuitous, and served no purpose what so ever to the story. Whilst perversely some of the scenes which required nudity seemed obviously choreographed to avoid such. The script was stretched with moments of grandeur and insight. These however, were brief and momentary causing great frustration. Fleeting breaths of oxygen, whilst helpful for breathing, will result in gradual suffocation. The movie was painful.

There is another young man but he is a plain looking tall skinny guy who falls for an older, short pudgy yoga instructor. They kiss. Some partial nudity but no sex scenes; not even simulated. They do go to bed with one another but you cannot see any action. Since they are predominantly older men who are not particularly great looking, you most likely wouldn't want to see their fully naked bodies anyway. There are no erotic sex scenes. There is a little nudity. Even the 'hustler' is old and ugly! The sound quality is very poor. The only thing that resembles a plot is when a couple splits up because of the hustler. One of the pair takes off. Will they ever get back together? No one will ever know since the movie doesn't bother to answer the question. So much for a plot.",1253404800,2,1122,4.322274881516588
