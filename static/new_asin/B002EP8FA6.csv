8368110,4,B002EP8FA6,"Simon brings his dulcet tones to the well-written and very interesting story of the planets. You will soon know how they got their names, how they were discovered and see all sorts of wonderful images. Unfortunately, this was produced before Pluto was downgraded, so it's still in there. But our son loves this and asks us to play it for him all the time. He's in preschool.",1375833600,3,374,4.597014925373134
8368111,5,B002EP8FA6,"The Eyewitness Series never disappoints.  The narration is well-done and the picture quality is wonderful.
The running time is ideal for young attention spans!",1373414400,,159,5.625

8368113,5,B002EP8FA6,"My kids love this series and the Planets is of exceptional interest to my 7 year old. He could watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it. I can watch it in the background and learn something new all the time. It moves quickly from one point to another without being too complex or difficult to understand. The filming and special effects are spectacular and the short film about the ""Making of"" the movie is a huge hit too.

Would recommend to anyone wanting to learn more about science and the environment. We own 3 eyewitness films already.",1352764800,2,557,4.46078431372549
8368114,4,B002EP8FA6,"This DVD lacks some of the insights of ""Universe"" or the ""Carl Sagan"" items, but is entertaining and informative nonetheless.

It takes the history of our solar system and the formation of the planets into account as it builds its narrative.

Perhaps the best aspect is the way its actually presented.
The DVD starts with the planets closer to the sun and logically, methodically works its way outwards.

There's good theiretical explanations on gas giants, how and why, as well as reasonably in depth coverage on Mars.

As an information piece at the price point, it's not too dated so I'd have to recommend it.",1337299200,2,612,4.8
8368115,1,B002EP8FA6,"I was really surprised at how low the productions values were and how totally uninformative this video was. I expected it to have a popular entertainment format. However, I also expected it to show some of the countless great still and moving images that now exist of the planets and the solar system. But it did not. In fact, the number of actual planet images was quite low, and what we got instead was a lot of cheap looking computer generated filler.",1336176000,4,454,4.548780487804878
8368116,5,B002EP8FA6,"This is the fourth movie out of the ""Eyewitness"" series we have seen. Our 4-year-old loves the series and also this movie about the planets. They recently talked about planets at school and she was excited and proud to recognize some of the material. As in all the other movies of this series, interesting facts are combined with beautiful and clearly understandable pictures. Would always recommend it and it is even fun to see for the parents.",1328659200,2,445,4.792207792207792
