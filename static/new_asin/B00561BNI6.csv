4583259,5,B00561BNI6,"This is an enjoyable, fun romantic comedy. It is a light movie that at times takes a formulaic route, but it is worth watching if you are a fan of this genre.",1321056000,2,158,3.96875
4583260,1,B00561BNI6,I actually like Mandy Moore as an actress. She is much better than all her pop star turned actresses counterparts. I was really disappointed with this film as I was looking forward to watch Mandy Moore on the screen. I barely remember the plot. All I remember was thinking how bad this film was while I was watching it. I can safely say that this is the worst movie I've seen in the last two years and I watch a lot of movies.,1319760000,,426,4.144578313253012
4583261,5,B00561BNI6,"Just watched this movie on Amazon Instant Video, thought it was a good movie, but it skipped a lot, like every 5 seconds or so. Not sure if it was because I was watching it on instant video or what. Have watched movies on instant video before without a problem. But anyway, love Kellan Lutz, Mandy Moore and Jane Seiymore, also the few seconds that Andrew Keegan was in the film. Like him as an actor but don't see him much in movies. It shows that no matter how new or old a marriage is, no matter how big or small the problem(s) that come to the surface, if you stick by those marriage vows, together you can conquer anything! So gold stars to the cast and to the story line :-",1319500800,,679,4.151515151515151
4583262,1,B00561BNI6,This movie was terrible.  Do not rent this from amazon find it for free on the internet...  Need I say more....,1319414400,2,111,4.238095238095238
4583263,1,B00561BNI6,"This movie was seriously disappointing. The movie tries to be comedy, romance, and drama. It just doesn't work. There is no spark between Moore and Lutz. I find both characters whiney and immature. Whoever wrote this has no sense of how a real mature relationship works which should have been the backbone for this comedy nor does the writer have any sense of what a therapist should look like.",1319328000,2,394,4.72463768115942
4583264,4,B00561BNI6,"This isn't the funniest romantic comedy, but it works pretty well as a movie. The movie features the rocky marriages of a divorce councilor and her parents'. The ups and downs in the marriages seem realistic and not overly Hollywoodized - something I appreciate as a married person myself. The plot even had a few original twists and turns. I for one was actually surprised by the ending, something I can't say about another romantic comedy I've ever seen. Overall, not bad.",1318636800,4,474,4.7926829268292686
4583265,3,B00561BNI6,"I bought this movie and watched it hoping for a funny cute romantic story from Mandy Moore.  I love the actors in this and thought they would make a good movie, the actors did their best with what was given to them.  The script was kind of blah. I enjoyed parts of the movie but will probably never watch it again. So I say rent it before you buy it so you know if you really want to own it!!",1318291200,18,392,3.8875
4583266,1,B00561BNI6,The worst movie of the year 2011.  The acting in this film was a joke.  They were basically reading the lines.  So dissapointed in Mandy Moore who is a fine actor.  I can tell she tried really hard.  There were no chemistry between any of the cast.  Awful director and directions.  Even Mandy Moore was just reading lines.  We watched it on Netflix and would like to get our money back :  Yes. It is that bad.  Please do not buy this movie.,1316822400,,440,4.192771084337349
4583267,4,B00561BNI6,"A: I've liked the actor over the years, and I have to say he did a great first job of directing, it had a look to it, that similar to the movies he choose to star in!

B: Actors are amazing, and did what they could with the script.

C: The script is what fails, it was textbook rom-almost-com, something that should of been work shopped on a college level, at least, before ever getting a green light for production. Honestly with Jane in this, I was expecting some good humor like ""Wedding Crashers"". The slightly humorous moments come from the small secondary screen time cast. and that's okay, but the main characters need to have equal funny time, before you start to wonder why are they there? Like for example in the movie ""Knocked Up!""

D: But for me, I would buy this movie instead of ""Something Borrowed"" any day!",1316217600,9,822,4.430463576158941
4583288,3,B00561BNI6,"this movie with Kellan Lutz wasn't a bad movie, but seen him in other movies which were much better. Let you all decide if you want to buy it or not. The main reason I bought is is because of Kellan Lutz. I have other movies with him in them and mainly bought this one to go with my other Kellan Lutz collection.",1461110400,,312,3.9682539682539684
4583289,3,B00561BNI6,Item is used. Original shrink wrapping has been replaced with a cheap looking one that looks like it was done by a 5 yr old. The box is broken. reason for the 3 stars is because the actual disc doesn't have any scratches.,1460678400,,221,4.162790697674419

4583312,4,B00561BNI6,"A sweet Mandy Moore-like love movie mostly about two couples struggling with love and marriage. The plot, while somewhat predictable, has a number of surprises that keep the viewer engaged with the characters.

4583314,5,B00561BNI6,"Mandy Moore is stunning as usual and has proven she can handle far more than the or ""teeny-bopper"" roles of the past.  I enjoyed the entire cast, as well as the story line.  excellent movie",1415059200,,189,4.371428571428571

4583331,3,B00561BNI6,"This is a good movie for a one time watch.  I would have given it two stars, but, it got the extra star for me having predicted the ending wrong.  With these type of movies it is the comedy that sets the movie part and this just did not have the laughs.",1401926400,,253,3.8461538461538463

4583336,5,B00561BNI6,The movie was funny as it played out to be. It wasn't romantic enough for me to blend in and believe in the marriage.,1401062400,,117,3.9166666666666665

4583348,4,B00561BNI6,"I enjoyed the simple theme.  It was real people with real problems.

4583351,1,B00561BNI6,"Mandy Moore's character is obnoxious not endearing. The character is neither intelligent or funny. The plot is thin and the counselor's methods are tired. The lead man and his sister in law are captivating, funny and charming. Together they almost save the film.",1400371200,,262,5.116279069767442

4583356,2,B00561BNI6,"Mediocre movie at best.  Predictable, and not that romantically cute. Mandy Moore is the one highlight. She does semi well in the part.",1399507200,,135,4.869565217391305

4583364,1,B00561BNI6,good looking people and thats about it very boring if your looking to kill sometime watch this movie same old boring story line about love and marriage nothing new has not been done a thousand times already,1397865600,,206,4.594594594594595
4583365,1,B00561BNI6,and 10 mins was too long!  Awful awful romantic comedy starring good people.  Don't waste your time on this one!,1397433600,,112,4.55

4583367,4,B00561BNI6,"Cute movie - nothing deep.  It was a bit predictable, but it was fairly entertaining to me. Shows about generational differences and the fact that we don't know everything in others lives.",1396915200,,188,4.875
4583378,3,B00561BNI6,"Fun movie but a bit heavy at times. A little melodramatic, Mandy is cute and lovable. Jane Seymour and Brolin are classic.",1396656000,,122,4.590909090909091
4583379,3,B00561BNI6,It was really cheesy but nice if you're in the mood for a corny chick flick. Definitely showed how ridiculous therapy is.,1396396800,,121,4.545454545454546
4583380,1,B00561BNI6,"I'm sorry but I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes of this movie. Normally I would give even a crappy movie a chance and watch until the end but I was instantly irritated by all the characters in this movie and couldn't foresee that I'd feel any differently if I watched another 15 minutes longer. I couldn't buy into the Mandy Moore character being a couples therapist; she just seemed too immature and young to take seriously as a therapist and don't get me started on the sister who was a big loser. Even Jane Seymour's character bugged me. For that reason, I give it one star.",1396224000,,584,4.416666666666667

Integrity goes a long way.",1395705600,,325,4.491525423728813
4583383,3,B00561BNI6,Cute comedy that has its moments. I liked it and enjoyed the Mandy Moore's character struggling with the challenges of her new marriage and the troubles her parents marriage is faced with and the balancing act she is struggling with throughout the film. Cute.,1395273600,,259,4.909090909090909

4583505,3,B00561BNI6,"A neat concept, good actors/actresses but poorly executed script.  The movie starts with the wedding of marriage counselor Mandy Moore and Kellan Lutz.  Things almost immediately degenerate in the married couples relationship as Mandy Moore's character psychotically tries to save her parents marriage from falling apart at any cost.  The problem is we don't have any back story outlining the relationships of either the main characters or their parents.  All we see is them NOT getting along.  Shouldn't we get to know them and care about them first?  It is not until the very end that you start to see any chemistry between the characters at all.  So, no character development until it is too late, the story starts off too late (we should have seen their relationships first before it falls apart) and overall poor execution of a great idea.  Plus, there is a reason Shakespeare always starts tragedies with a wedding and ends comedies with a wedding; that bears out here as it is a tragedy this wasn't a better movie.",1379635200,,1021,4.861271676300578

I had no expectations about how funny or dramatic the film might be, and so wasn't disappointed. The film isn't hilarious but does have its humorous moments. It also has some rather unnecessarily silly moments, which is why I could never rate this as a 5-star film. But it is quite touching and tender at times. If you like sentimental movies and can tolerate a little unnecessary silliness, then you might enjoy this movie. If you're a Mandy Moore fan, then don't pass it up.",1374019200,,605,4.559633027522936

She lets her cute but extremely immature and irresponsible little sister be office manager (of her counseling practice). She moves her dad into her newlywed home, six weeks after getting married and without asking her husband first. Their philandering best man is so touched by their wedding that he decides to turn over a new leaf before waking up married to a Polish waitress who doesn't speak English and he's so so so in love. She's devastated to find that her husband has been married before and got an anullment....and this is where I just couldn't take it anymore.

It was because of their 30 year happy marriage that the daughter became a marriage counselor in the first place.
Really? How incredibly inappropriate and unbelievable! I don't know what the rest of the movie was about.

The movie was decent, 3 1/2 stars, but just rent it or watch it while it is prime, not worth spending much money on.",1341446400,,290,4.105263157894737

4583671,2,B00561BNI6,Not very good. The movie has good characters that never take off. I was bored and considered many times turning it off. Disappointing.,1340409600,,134,4.869565217391305

4583673,5,B00561BNI6,"I felt that this movie was a fresh new spin on classic romantic comedies. Yes, with any romantic comedy, you have the cliche' happy couple who inevitably face some sort of problem and a potential break-up, which is most commonly rectified at the end of the movie. However, I thought the particular situation of this movie was very interesting. It attempts to examine how things change from the start of a relationship, through the engagement and wedding planning stage, and eventually to the actual marriage. The movie begins with the happy couple, Kellan Lutz and Mandy Moore, who prove to have incredible onscreen chemistry, getting married. Then come the relationship changes that inevitably come with living with someone, which are only accelerated by Moore's parents' divorce. The storyline has humor and heart.",1340064000,,816,5.1893939393939394
4583674,1,B00561BNI6,tried to hard to b cute and witty and not sure if it was the script or brolin trying to hard to 'act' or moore as a psychologist (about as believable as her being the president of the USA) but gosh it was hard to stay awake. kept fast forwarding till the pain was finally over and the movie also. i'm adding mine with the other 45 atm of 'used' copies to be sold.,1339632000,,363,3.918918918918919
4583675,5,B00561BNI6,"This movie shows the ups and downs of marriage including a very common habit that woman engage in which is getting overly involved in others affairs or meddling. This movie was not a laugh-out-loud movie, but highly interesting non-the-less. Not cliche rom-com as there's actually a lesson we all can learn from this movie, married and single alike. It was not what I expected in a good way. Very entertaining. Fun movie that most people 25 and up will enjoy.",1338595200,,459,4.75
4583676,1,B00561BNI6,"I was pretty disappointed with this. I enjoyed Mandi Moore in another movie in this past, but this movie felt contrived. The acting wasn't that good either. Overall - not worth the time to watch it.",1333065600,,198,4.527777777777778

4583691,3,B00561BNI6,"This movie is not as bad as Entertainment Weekly made it out to be. It was touted as one of the worst movies of the year. I would not say that. I'd say if you are a fan of romantic comedies and glimpses into the lives of how different marriages and people operate, give this a shot. It is no where near perfect, and is definitely one director's vision into a movie like this. The acting isn't great either, and sometimes Mandy can get to be too much. BUT if you can rent it for cheap or catch it on one of the movie channels (Showtime is running it already), go ahead and take a chance and watch it if it's up your alley. It's only 1 1/2 hours, so hey, if you don't like it then you only lost 1 1/2 hours of your time. I just don't like movies that are actually watchable to get such a bad rap.
Take a chance on this one; hey, you may actually love it!",1327622400,,852,3.930635838150289
4583692,1,B00561BNI6,"Did anyone notice the odd color of the husband's hair? Did he dye his hair blonde???? It ruined the movie for me. In addition to the fact that these people could not act. I think both characters had bad hair. Mandy's hair was all dark and weird looking. It was a compilation of pathetic hair, corny lines, and poor actors. It sounded like they were reading from a screen with no feelings. There were so many times I wanted to just yell ""CUT""! The plot needed a little more too. I guess they just did not have much to work with from the beginning. It probably would have presented another level of drama if issues had surfaced right before the daughter was about to be married, or while she was preparing. Either way, the hair really would have ruined it all hands down. It was kind of creepy!",1327017600,2,792,4.358108108108108

4583695,5,B00561BNI6,Fixing somebody's marriage is never meant to be fun at all in real life especially if they are your parents. Much more if your own relationship is in peril.

Mandy Moore was the only bright spot, but her character's choices were so stupid that it was unwatchable. I finally gave up about halfway through and didn't finish. I don't know why Kellan Lutz keeps getting hired; he's not that good looking and he is a truly terrible actor. So unbelievably bad in this one. Jane Seymour was chewing up her scenes like she hadn't eaten in a year, James Brolin was apathetic and much as I love Christopher Lloyd, he should have passed on this one. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Just awful.",1484870400,,625,4.539823008849558
