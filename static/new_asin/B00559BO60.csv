8457677,3,B00559BO60,"In Burnface (or Caracremada), director Llus Galter creates an extreme atmosphere of suspense and tension with silence and deeply contemplative expressions. Close-up shots of the guerilla fighters and surrounding inhabitants reveal discontent and hard living during the era of the Francoist regime. With such economy of dialogue, a kind of intense desperation presides and then soon dominates the entire picture.

Galter provides us with gorgeous cinematography that features the beautiful panoramas near the Catalan Pyrenees, but he seems better suited for photography rather than filmmaking. The film is so replete with still shots and slow pans that it often gives the impression of a story told through slides. His camera shots start becoming indulgently redundant that by the middle of the film, the suspense begins to lose sustenance and sadly, the picture is left stagnating. The somber monotony of too many downcast faces, boots, faces, guns, faces, landscape shots, and faces eventually leads to an exercise in viewer patience. Actors are used like props and remain one-dimensional. Films don't need action or plots to connect with their audience, but when a film like Burnface makes that immediate connection, it's important to keep the viewer connected so he or she won't become ambivalent towards the film and its characters. Burnface is a classic example of style overpowering substance. Unfortunately, the style, or intense photographic suspense, is inadequate because it ultimately loses its impact. Since this happens to be Galter's first full-length feature, it's understandable that he has more to learn about the full power of cinema.",1441584000,,1652,5.47843137254902
