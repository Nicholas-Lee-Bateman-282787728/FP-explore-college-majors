654235,5,6303451527,"Super funny movie, great comic timing, not to mention excellent songs by Gaye DeLorme, immortal composer of ""The Rodeo Song.""",1342656000,,125,5.3
654236,3,6303451527,"Like all their movies, Cheech & Chong's THINGS ARE TOUGH ALL OVER (1982) suffers under the harsh light of sobriety. Their many illegal substance references simply fall flat without the proper ""atmosphere."" Also, Tommy's chewing on a horse doover that he thinks is peyote, or his sulfurous flatulence are simply in bad taste. The 'two uglies in drag' sequence isn't as funny as it seemed a quarter century ago, either.

Their turn as a pair of heavily-accented Arabs, Mr. Slyman and Prince Habib remains this movie's strongest material and if we ignore present world circumstances it's good for a few chuckles. (Examples: ""hairpiece/herpes"" joke and Habib ""killing"" a rental car.) Zany Rip Taylor is another comedic highlight, but George Wallace's cameo as the ""Champ"" who's become a drunken street person is just sad.

SYNOPSIS--
Two Chicago car wash screw-ups are sent to Las Vegas by their Arab employers, unaware that the luxury car they're driving has five million ""dirty"" bucks stashed under a seat. Along the way, the boys barter for fuel with pieces of the car, including that seat. They drop off the disassembled vehicle in Vegas then cut out with a couple of ""French Fifis"" (played by wives Rikki and Shelby), again not knowing these are the bosses' girlfriends.

When they find their cash gone, an enraged Slyman and Habib begin hunting down our heroes, who are meanwhile involved in all kinds of nutty stuff, including some ""in flagrante"" time with the Fifis as part of a clandestinely-shot skin flick, and gettng abandoned by Rip Taylor at a fancy eatery while they're crossdressed. As Tommy freaks out over his missing gonads (blame it on pantyhose), the Arabs are right behind them in the next booth!

654359,4,6303451527,"A classic Cheech and Chong. I saw this movie at least twice in the past, and it was fun to see again.
There are good guys and bad guys in this movie, and Cheech and Chong play both parts. It's another B movie, but it has a cute story line, and they do some outrageous things. They head to Vegas to deliver a car to make a little cash. Only problem is, they leave without any cash for gas along the way, selling off car parts as they go.
After the shell of a car is delivered, the Arabs that own the car go hunting for them, looking to kill them. Has an unexpected ending though. Really one of their better movies.",1238976000,,613,4.032786885245901

654362,5,6303451527,"Saw this when it first came out and remember my date just laughing constantly & loudly in the theater through the whole movie. I laughed alot myself.  Good memory, good movie.  This is the funniest and best Cheech & Chong movie (I think that the 2nd best is ""Cheech and Chong's Next Movie"").  Being a musician and being the age that I am (47), I love the musicians & band scenes/jokes, of which there are many in this film.  I haven't seen the DVD version, and don't think I'll buy it as there doesn't seem to be any extras on it at all.  Are there?",1175472000,,549,4.190476190476191
654363,2,6303451527,"This adventure of Cheech & Chong see's them playing a couple of dudes who work for some Arab dudes who like want them to drive a car from Detroit to Las Vegas but they have no idea why, they just wanna get paid for the job. There's a lot of things happening to them as they drive from one place to the other.

There isn't much of the ""Stoner"" humor in this one compared to other C&C movies. The laughs arnt as strong as the others either, but the humor is still definitely there. I have a feeling Richard ""Cheech"" Marin probably wanted to show he could act as something other then the Cheech character; they play a couple of Arabs in the movie as well, and lean more towards a humor not so pot-headed. I think Cheech was trying to establish himself as a real actor. But least he stayed true to Cheech tho, he didn't kill the character or anything.

I'd say this is the weakest of all the C&C movies. I even think ""Get Out Of My Room"" is funnier then this... but don't count it out tho, it's still got some great bits in it.... my fav is when Cheech needs to go to the bathroom and ends up going a way he didn't expect.

There's no bonus features or anything which is a bummer. Seems the only one to get any attention has been the first movie... if there not going to give these things extra features, then they should have at least made the DVD a double feature with ""Nice Dreams""

We need a new Cheech & Chong movie, this may be the weakest, but it's still better then most of the stoner movies being made these days, that's why we need Tommy and Richard to make a new one to show the kids today how it's done.",1118707200,4,1611,4.1210191082802545
654364,4,6303451527,Ditching their pot smoking image the duo suceeds brilliantly at more conventional humour. Best scene is the sobbing cry sketch the duo have with Rip Torn.,1100304000,3,154,4.961538461538462
654365,4,6303451527,"Cheech and Chong are back as the usual miscreants whose motto is nothing less than sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.  Their present adventure carrying all the same low-brow humor as in their other great comedy films.

Cheech and Chong are now in Detroit working for an Arab sheik and his body guard (also played by Cheech and Chong) who own a car wash named 'The Two Guys From Mecca'.  Being involved in rather shady business, the sheik gives Cheech and Chong a job driving a limousine to Las Vegas as a drive-away with $10,000 stashed in one of the seats.  Broke and having no knowledge of the hidden money, the comic pair soon has to come up with clever ways of paying their way to Sin City.  The audience follows Cheech and Chong in their wild trek to Las Vegas while they're being chased by their two angry employers: how will they get out of this pickle?

Another great adventure with the two miscreants of comedy. This film is just as great as their other films such as 'Up In Smoke' and 'Nice Dreams'.  Don't miss it!",1092355200,4,1021,4.398936170212766

What is really nice is when you click on the ""Aspect Ratio Selection"", you have the choice of widescreen or full screen. Richard ""Cheech"" Marin and Tommy Chong are funny again and this is an easy movie to follow. As usual NOT for children to see. Cheech & Chong are working at a car wash in Chicago. They lose the job (what else is new with these two?) and then go on to form a rock band. Later they head for Las Vegas. What kind of trouble can these two men get in to now? Rip Taylor is a riot in this film. He will have you laughing at both ends. Lots of Las Vegas locations. The next Cheech & Chong film is STILL SMOKIN' (1983).

654460,4,6303451527,"This is probably the least known and the least watched Cheech and Chong movie there is.  I myself was trying to find it for years, but thank God it has been released on DVD.  This movie is the best on DVD and there is no other way to wathc other than on DVD.  The sound is good and for a movie that was made in 1982 the picture looks extremely rich and beautiful.  The only bad thing about the DVD is that it doesn't really have to many special features on it, but that isn't why you should but this.  The movie foucuses on Cheech and Chong living in Chicago and working for two Arab brothers (played by Cheech and Chong).  When a money deal goes wrong for the Arabs they send Cheech and Chong to take the money to Las Vegas.  Overall the movie is very funny, it is probably the second funniest Cheech and Chong movie after Up in Smoke.  You should see this movie, it has many very hilarious scenes and one at the end that is particulary hard to forget!",995155200,5,953,4.141304347826087
654461,5,6303451527,"This is without a doubt the greatest motion picture of all time.  It works on so many levels.  It is such a shame that it is so underrated and not considered Cheech and Chong's best work.  Every single scene in this movie is hilarious. Cheech and Chong play two roles brilliantly and flawlessly, and the supporting cast is great.  The scene with the champ is a film classic.  Many people might say this film is bad because it has little plot and looks like it was made on a low budget, but that is the brilliance of it.  A great movie comes out of nothing.  It is so simple that it is brilliant.  I was surprised to learn that this movie did not rank as one of the 100 best comedies of all time in an American Film Institue poll released last year.  It was beat out by such sorry films as ""Harold and Maude"" and a bunch of Woody Allen movies.  Woody Allen is the most overrated comedian ever and it's time people started to recognize that.  And let's not forget the #1 comedy ""Some like it hot"". Big deal. Marilyn Monroe and a couple of guys dressed as women hiding from the mob.  I saw parts of that movie and I was not amused.  Anyway, ""Things are tough all over"" is truly a great film and forget about all the ""Gone with the wind"" and ""Citizen Kane"" talk, this movie rises far above either of those.  If you want to watch a piece of film history, check it out.  It is defenitely worth your while.  Take care and keep it real.",992304000,2,1428,4.175824175824176
654462,4,6303451527,"Thing's Are Tough All Over is a different approach for Cheech and Chong, and it suprisingly and finitely works to they're advantage.  In this film, there isn't as much weed as there was in past movies, but it has some drug moments in case the always tokers are interested (a very funny joke comes up in the desert dealing with paiotti by the way).
But in this film, they play 2 characters a piece- Cheech as himself and Mr. Slyman and Chong as himself and Prince Habib.  Depending on how much you like the duo's characters depends on if you like the movie, but if you find them funny, as I did, then you have the key.  Especially since the unintended jokes by the two arabs are hilarious (i have hairpiece on my head/you have herpes on your head?).
Anyway, the plot deals with the two guys (themselves) on a mission across America from Chicago to Las Vegas to deliver a car which gets dismantled along the way.  Funny all the way from the beggining Chuck Berry rant to the porno with C & C, with many things to look for along the way.  Definately worth while.",989884800,,1059,4.355329949238579
