7836036,5,6303050190,I searched high and low for this movie. Oh how I love the simplicity of this film. The acting is so believable I get so taken away each time I watch it.,1461024000,,152,3.78125
7836037,2,6303050190,"A hard-living torch singer becomes a mail-order bride on a North Dakota wheat farm. Yeah, right. ""The Purchase Price"" must have looked silly in 1932. Try though they might, Barbara Stanwyck and director William A. Wellman cannot salvage a ludicrous script. Stanwyck never gave a bad performance, but George Brent and Lyle Talbot are miscast. Little pre-Code spark in this hokey Warner Bros. melodrama.",1430784000,,401,5.28125
7836038,3,6303050190,"but this not nearly one of her better movies. Maybe, in my mind, it suffers in comparison to others I saw just before this like Night Nurse, which was much better. But it is good. The dialect? It's not only hick,  it is 1930's hick. No offense it's just a little odd & amusing. She is Joan, a big city showgirl seeking to escape the life & becomes a mail order bride to a destitute farmer in the middle of nowhere. He's seeking a little warmth & they do immediately get married. All he gets is kicked out of his bed as they pursue a platonic marriage. She adjusts very well to the rustic life including a severe North Dakota winter. He is just one step from being kicked off his farm as the mortgage is overdue. All he needs is time to plant the miracle wheat seeds he has developed. She has a big city boyfriend with $$$. So you can surmise what will happen after everybody's pride & honor is satisfied. Oh yeah, they decide they are in love in the last scene. Fade out. That's a brief overview. It is a pre-code movie but still pretty tame.",1197504000,3,1042,4.21
7836039,4,6303050190,"I haven't much to add to previous reviews as far as this film's overall style and content. George Brent manages to inject a bit of sly humor into his ""aw, shucks"" character , and Barbara Stanwyck corners the market on pre-code sassy.  Entertaining stuff.  But let me confess:  the real reason this film has earned its spot on our shelf is one of the classic movie lines of all time,  ""Ya daffy tomato, I'm bugs about ya!"".  Who could resist?",1015977600,14,441,4.4625
7836040,4,6303050190,"That's the title of a song in which Joan Gordon (Stanwyck) sings in THE PURCHASE PRICE. In this one, Stanwyck is a nightclub entertainer who becomes tired of the big city and her bootlegger sweetheart (Lyle Talbot). Barbara decides to become the ""picture bride"" of Jim Gilson (George Brent) a North Dakota wheat farmer! A rough neighbor by the name of Bull McDowell offers to bail Jim out of his heavily mortgaged farm - if Barbara goes with it...........This little flick from 1932 was based upon a novel entitled THE MUD LARK by Arthur Stringer; it starts out snappy enough, but it gets rather silly and implausible during the second half. Brent has to play a very wooden character, but he does so with some stress on comedy. Stanwyck is always interesting to watch, even when she has to scream violently (which she does). This movie was made immediately after Barbara's triumphant performance (which was highly praised by the critics) in SO BIG, based upon the famous Edna Ferber novel. Her performance, in fact was so honest that the NEW YORK TELEGRAPH stated that ""Miss Stanwyck offers a characterization worthy of the cinematic Hall of Fame. Her great talent as an actress never has been demonstrated more brilliantly. A sparkling performance; she is magnificent"". It's ironic that lesser quality old movies can be found on video but SO BIG, for instance, cannot.",1004659200,11,1369,4.905172413793103
7836041,5,6303050190,"The first time I saw the movie, the purchase price, I was unsure of what was going on for I had been watching AMC and turned on the movie when it was near the end. Even seeing the bits and pieces of the film before I had actually seen it as a whole still left me in awe of what an amazing movie it is. This is a classic romantic movie that never lets you leave the room. The story of an attractive show girl running from her unwanted company and ending up with what seems like a loveless farmer may seem strange though turns out to be a fabulous plot. Throughout the movie you yearn for the two characters, Barbara Stanwyck and George Brent, to get together. I would hate to ruin the rest of the story so buy it. It will remain a favorite piece for generations whom appreciate a really great love story.",978998400,8,803,4.153846153846154
