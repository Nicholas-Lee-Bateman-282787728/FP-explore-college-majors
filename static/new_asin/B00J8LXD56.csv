6338340,5,B00J8LXD56,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this movie!  Granted, the bar for movies adapted from a video game franchise is pretty low, but this is easily the best one ive seen.  Even compared to other DC animated films, which are all pretty good movies, i think, this one stands out.  It has a lot more mature content than any others, what with it focusing on villains, the Suicide Squad, as main characters instead of any heroes, and it uses the fact that that it is set in a video game universe instead of the same universe as the movies to kill off notable DC characters.  This creates a sense of danger and suspense that is sometimes lacking in superhero movies. With good action, animation, music, and story, Batman: Assault on Arkham is definitely worth a watch(just be sure mind the PG13 rating if you are a concerned parent)!",1406592000,,827,4.5675675675675675
6338341,5,B00J8LXD56,"Totally blown away by this film! First of all, its very good American animation, second, The writeing is top notch; plot, charicters, action, and everything else. This is easily the best Batman animated film ever--I'm not exaggerating.

The script alone is worthy of a feature film, and I think I see why it is animated; to make a live action film that would live up to this script and do it justice would probably break their budget.

Not for young teens; this is an animation for the folks who love the grittier darker side of the Batman mythology.

A great and dark thrill ride of a film!  This is a 'must see'.  Or in the final one word dialogue of the film; ""Bang!""",1406592000,3,670,4.414634146341464
6338342,1,B00J8LXD56,"I'm a big fan of animated superhero movies, but not this one.  If small things bother you, consider this movie a death by a thousand pin pricks:

+Orchestral music typical of this genre is dropped for DUBSTEP WUBWUBWUBW--KIDS LOVE DUB STEP, RIGHT?
+Plot makes no attempt to make even a modicum of sense.  In fact, there's not a single ten minute interval wanting of some completely unnecessary, logically baffling, or flat-out ridiculous occurrence.  I'd happily give examples, but oh, is that list a long one:  Consider the beginning of the film where the Riddler is smart enough to hack into a government database only to waste time telling riddles (because he's the RIDDLER--get it?  Get it?!) and eventually get caught by having his feed get tracked by government agents.  No explanation is given as to why the Riddler was doing this in the first place, and moreover, shouldn't the government have known exactly where he was in the first place (how many ultra-secret yet minimally protected government server databases with camera feeds are out there?).  Anyway, two minutes later, we have a squad of capable government agents break into... their own facility... and aptly isolate and place the Riddler into custody--only to have Batman appear--AND START FIGHTING THE POLICE, like busting noses, KO'ing guys, and breaking arms in the most gratuitous and wanton way possible.  Why are you fighting the good guys Batman?  Just to to have a ""WHUR IS SHE?!"" moment?  Granted.  In this scene it's a ""WHUR IS IT?!"" moment but at this point I'm so confused about the entire set of surrounding circumstances.  Oh, by the way, Batman eventually let's the Riddler escape while fighting the good guys without so much as bruising the guy.

+There's so many awkward pauses after sight gags that aren't even attempting to be funny.  Consider, for example, an early scene where we  have the self-coined Suicide Squad parachute drop into Gotham (because taking the bus was just too damn stealthy) and then hiking through the sewers to avoid detection from Batman--again, why go through the trouble of parachuting then if you're trying to keep a low profile?  Augh, whatever.  Anyway, the team lands conveniently in some isolated alley (and the metal crates they were locked in evaporated into helium by the looks of it) and the camera cuts to Harley who's upside down and exclaims ""I landed on my head!""  Then there's like a 12 second awkward pause/animation loop where she's just there, kicking her legs, as if there's a laugh track going on that someone forgot to put in or cut out at the last second.  I mean, there's like this weird dead time at the end of every scene--and especially the ones meant to have a comedic impact--that's just *hangs* there as if this whole movie was bereft of a properly seasoned editor.

+""Yahtzee"" is not a catchphrase.  No.  Shame on you.

+Poor use of cursing.  I'm fine for villains and heroes cursing in the animated films, but when it's used stupidly, it just stands out and feels lame.  Having Batman scream profanities when he's fighting for his life in The Dark Knight is one thing, having the Joker walk into a room and scream ""What's up bitches?!"" just feels easy and cheap.

+Also the Joker escapes in the end after being dropped in a helicopter that explodes on impact in a shot that never cuts away... so... you know, how'd he survive?  Eh.  Let's not bother explaining it.  How about more DUBSTEP. WUB WUB WUB WUBWUBWUBWUBWUWB.

+What else?  All the minorities die first.  All the women sub-leads flirt with the nearest alpha/beta males.  Batman is only in this for like 30% of the movie. Reused key frames.  Fight scenes that take place in their own space/time dimension where people heal from knife/gun wounds instantaneously--including helicopter explosions, characters that have superhuman powers but prefer to just spend most of the movie punching grunts in the face, and Captain Boomerang reminding us every line he gets that he's Cockney British (""Roit roit.  We'll do boss, that I will, yeh. Chip chip.  Bucket of crips and that, eh?"")  Just cheap drivel all around.  An embarrassment even on a resume.  Literal poop.

Positive notes:
-Voice acting was stellar.",1406592000,29,4206,4.90084985835694

6338348,5,B00J8LXD56,"I was skeptical at first as I didn't care much for the art on the cover of the movie, but I was pleasantly surprised that like many of the animated shows that the DC Animated Universe (DCAU) has put out so far, it has spectacular animation. And the plot itself is spectacular; I could really get into the story even though I know next to nothing about the Suicide Squad outside of the DC live action movie (which I wasn't as particularly fond of, but I digress). I even managed to get a friend who doesn't like DC all that much to watch and enjoy this movie if that says anything.

It has a lot of great funny moments and is a great lead-up to the Arkham video games.",1518652800,2,667,4.170542635658915

6338388,5,B00J8LXD56,"I often cringe when taking a chance on comic book related movie or animations.  Is it worth the x amount of cash I paid to view this?

For ""Batman: Assault on Arkham"", after viewing it, I sure am glad I took the chance!

The content and story definitely makes this NOT a 'kiddie' show.  Fine by me.  Its always refreshing for me to see an animation that isn't for kids.  The way most of Batman's villains are portrayed here fit my tastes very well.  Real serious attitude, violence, and yet still with enough connection to previous DC animations that my inner child was melting with glee.

Personally, I was sad that Mark Hamill did not voice the Joker in this one.  And yet, Jokers voice in this one was superbly done.  Very, very similar.  Regardless, the overall production was surprisingly good.  The writing was well done.  ALL the voice actors gave their characters personality and depth on a superb level.

I really cant say anything bad about this title or the work.  If I had to absolutely choose any sort of beef with this, well, it would be tiny little environmental things in some of the animation that doesn't really affect the story or presentation.

Finally I am really thankful for titles like this.  Other comic-book related titles and franchise reboots recently done often really disappoint me.  (Especially a lot of the live-action ones.) I am glad that these are around as another option for those like me that cant stand how some live action is done lately.",1490832000,3,1478,4.662790697674419

The violence that is shown or implied is truly gruesome, and the female characters are vulgarly sexualized. The entire story is nothing but a series of double-crosses and gruesome deaths, with blood squirting all over the place and characters' heads exploding. Batman himself is a minor character, which almost amounts to false advertising.

I love all the characters that make appearances even if there for just a little while, my favorite was Poison Ivy, her going crazy on Arkham besides Harley was the best. Wish there was more Poison Ivy interacting with squad, but still this is a great movie!",1472342400,6,553,4.485148514851486
6338466,4,B00J8LXD56,"I'm a longtime fan of the comics, tv series, and animated movies.  Like others have said, Batman is more of a supporting character.  The movie would have been more appropriately titled, ""Assault on Arkham, featuring Task Force X and Batman"".  I rated it a four because there was good action, humor, the characters played off each other really well.  I liked the animation and the voice work  (except Penguin).  I couldn't give it a five because the characters were just dropped on us at the beginning, and there were some plot holes.  I've been around awhile, so for example I knew Capt Boomerang was there because he's a classic member of Suicide Squad.  A new viewer would be like, ""Who in the world is this boomerang guy??  Really??"" I would have rather they cut some of the Arkham escapee scenes (which added ZERO to the plot) and instead added to each Task Force X character's intro scene.  Also, they never explained *why* they picked these particular felons to participate, or why one was singled out later.  And at the end, I felt it was out of character for Batman to not go after a certain character.  I have not read any of DC's New 52 Suicide Squad title that I suspect this is partially based on.  Maybe in that title Deadshot is Leader Guy, but his characterization as that in this movie kinda threw me off.  He was a little too...normal.  Maybe because he's the one guy they transparently really wanted you to root for, hoping you forget that he's a mass murderer.  And this just hit me - Black Spider is a black dude?  Come on DC.  Y'all can do better than that.",1472256000,2,1578,4.496478873239437

6338475,5,B00J8LXD56,"THE FILM: I was, quite honestly, blown away by this. It's only the third DCAU movie I've seen, but I am quickly becoming impressed. The basic plot is that Amanda Waller needs something from the Riddler, so she assembles Task Force X and has them break into Arkham to retrieve it for her. Batman and the Joker also have key supporting roles that round out a fast-paced, action-packed story. So, as you might be able to tell, despite Batman's name being part of the title, this is more of a Suicide Squad movie. And in that respect, this film succeeds in every way that David Ayer's live-action one failed. Little time is wasted setting up backstories, opting instead for short clips to introduce each squad member AFTER the title card. There was also a lot more internal tension as each squad member is forced to work with each other to complete their mission, something that was also lacking in this year's SUICIDE SQUAD. Put simply, what I saw here in terms of character work was amazing. The film was also really funny at times. Everyone had at least a couple moments to shine in that regard. In particular, King Shark and Captain Boomerang were comic relief. As for the animation, it had an anime-like style that was very beautiful and fluid. I was also surprised at how mature this was. While not terribly explicit (this is PG-13 after all, but kind of pushes the edge), Harley Quinn and Killer Frost (the female Squad members) were quite sexy in a way that I didn't exactly remember from the animated series. However, what really put's this among the best DC animated films I seen (so far) is the economy and efficiency of the storytelling, excellent animation, and brilliant voice work. The problems I have with it are rather minor. There was a particular score cue that reminded me of the worst electro-house, and the voice actor doing Gordon sounded a little too young for how he was drawn. That's it. If you saw SUICIDE SQUAD and didn't like it, give this a try. If you didn't, see this anyway. And if you already have, maybe now's the time to watch it again.

THE EXTRAS: There's a decent assortment of bonus features provided that go deeper into the characters and DC lore. Chief among these (although by no means the best) is an 8-10 minute featurette on Harley Quinn, starting with her origin on BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES and continuing with her different runs in comics. There was also a 5-minute look at (what was the next, at the time) the DCAU film JUSTICE LEAGUE: THRONE OF ATLANTIS, centered around Arthur Curry/Aquaman. Rounding out the features common to all releases were four cartoon episodes from JUSTICE LEAGUE, et al, particularly on featuring Task Force X. Exclusive to the Blu-ray is a roughly half-hour documentary on Arkham Asylum. The most interesting part to me was learning where it came from. The name comes from H.P. Lovecraft, while the idea of Arkham Asylum came from a big expose in the 1960's, with itself being introduced in the comics in the 1970's. There was also a general discussion of Arkham as a character, and an existential conflict between dark and light. Pretty cool, if I say so myself. The cherry on top is a feature-length commentary on the main film.

OVERALL: Whatever DC/WB Animation has been doing that makes their films so good, DC and the Snyder-verse should take some notes. BATMAN: ASSAULT ON ARKHAM is a lean, mean storytelling machine that treats the characters and audience with respect, and is certainly one of the best efforts of their direct-to-video animated films. There was also a decent amount of bonus features to round out one's viewing experience. Simply put, this is a must-see for fans of comics and animation.",1471651200,8,3687,4.732503888024883

6338487,5,B00J8LXD56,"I really liked this movie.  Harley Quinn is the standout character and makes this movie.  Heidi Hynden Walch does a fantastic job capturing Harley's maniacal personality.  The rest of the cast do a great job capturing the character they voice as well.  The story plays out almost like the movie Ocean's 11.  Batman is involved, but the Suicide Squad are at the forefront.  I actually ended up purchasing this movie because I could definitely watch it again and enjoy it.  On par with some of DCU's best movies",1470787200,,509,4.715909090909091
6338488,4,B00J8LXD56,"I don't know who exactly this movie is made for. It's really a suicide squad movie but it's marketed as a Batman film. It's also supposed to be about the squad or Batman but becomes really the Joker's movie over time. It's got costumes from the videogames mixed up with the TV shows (all of them cartoons and live action) and comic books giving the characters an off center vibe. I'm not a long time fan or whatever so it didn't bother me. I might other some. The rest of the movie suffers from the same thing. They made a cartoon but it's got Nolan style violence, Snyder style comic book self seriousness, and Alan Moore-esque sexual issues. It's all over the map.

All that said, for what it is, it's not bad. It moves quickly. They do stuff in the film that they can't in the live action TV shows and movies due to expense. So, you get a better sense of them actually being powerful. Killer Frost can create random ice walls and the like. You won't see that any time soon on the TV shows or movies but that's also cause it's the H-lister Killer Frost. I did like that vibe to the show. Lots of goofballs in one place. It eventually just turns into Batman and Joker antics but realistically that's comfort food and nothing wrong with that.

The animation quality is a bit up and down. I know this is cheap. Probably, I'm lucky that it's consistent as it is. They also spent a lot of money on getting back voice actors. It's a bit annoying cause frankly I enjoy changes of pace and I'm not gonna have warm fuzzies off a cartoon show I barely remember but again...it just shows the wierdness of who this is made for. The only people who would get a huge kick out of that are people most likely in their late to early 40s. It might explain all the increased amounts of violence and sexual content too. It could also be that the middle aged animators and film makers didn't want to bore themselves either.

It's not a great film but it's interesting. I got more a kick out of trying to figure out who the demographic audience was for this more than anything else but I was still entertained overall. They're going for something. I'm not sure what but it was something and they could've just bored us to death with something more vanilla than this.",1470700800,,2246,4.355608591885441

I have had mixed experience with the DC comic animations.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Under-the-Red-Hood-Blu-ray/dp/B003ITZBVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: Under the Red Hood [Blu-ray</a>] was excellent both from the point of view of being a true to feeling batman cartoon and having a screenplay that highlighted the moral tensions that exist within batman, but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Gotham-Knight-Blu-ray/dp/B001614FX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: Gotham Knight [Blu-ray</a>] was too artsy and the brevity of the short stories made the production feel disjointed.

The problem with this story from my POV is that it focused more around Harley Quinn and Deadshot than it did batman.  The voice acting was good and the animation was solid.  I enjoyed that the screenplay did not waste time having long moments of ennui of batmans past, and I did enjoy that the suicide squad made up of bad guys continue to be bad guys even screwing over one another, there is not even a hint of redemption with these people which feels real (though is somewhat despairing).  However, I do not like rooting for bad guys, and I did not find myself enjoying action sequences where the suicide squad are murdering cops to accomplish there missions.  I also felt that the introduction of certain elements like the one night stand between Harley Quinn and deadshot were done in such a way that made the cartoon more adult than necessary (parents you don't see anything, but it is done in such a way that is uncomfortable to to put it mildly).  I wish they had included more batman earlier in the movie.

Fans of batman will probably enjoy this movie, but the bad guy heavy story line and the inclusion of some adult themes more than necessary injure its appeal from being as good as red hood or being a movie to enjoy with the whole family.",1459209600,2,1982,5.518151815181518

6338575,4,B00J8LXD56,"Tying into the Batman: Arkham video game franchise, Assault On Arkham takes place in the same universe happening sometime after Arkham Origins, but before Arkham Asylum. This DC Universe Animated movie isn't connected to the current New 52 titles, and is directed by former Justice League animator Jay Oliva with and Avatar: The Last Airbender director Ethan Spaulding. This was done as being a lot more mature than the traditional DC animated films, and is the first movie outing of the Suicide Squad.

The Riddler finds out some secrets from Amanda Waller, the head of a secret government agency, but Batman puts him in Arkham, so in order to get the data back, Waller assembles Task Force X. This is a select group of criminals that Waller forces to do suicide missions, otherwise they get blown up from an explosive inserted in their body. For this trip, Waller gets: Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Killer Frost, King Shark, Black Spider, and Deadshot, although the non-Batman heroes that some of these villains arch are never referred to in the movie, so no cameos by Flash or Firestorm. Waller sends them to break into Arkham and steal a thumb drive Riddler had confiscated in his cane that has restricted info on it. Most of the Suicide Squad take on the appearance of asylum staff, while Deadshot disguised as a guard pretends to be bringing in Harley, but not after having a major tiff with a locked up Joker. The Squad then put on their supervillain threads and storm into the storage room, but discover that there isn't a thumb drive in it. Batman pops in knowing of the Squad's infiltration, and is seemingly taken out by Black Spider. Killer Frost ditches them to secretly kill Riddler for Waller, but he tells her and the others that the real reason they were all sent to kill him was because Riddler knew how to turn off the bombs in their heads. The bad guys go the infirmary to use electro-shock to deactivate the Squad's bombs. Meanwhile, Joker has busted loose, and busts in just at the moment the Squad is getting bomb-removal therapy. Riddler figures out that Black Spider was really Batman in disguise, and all hell busts loose as Batman fights Joker, while Black Spider and King Shark have their heads asplode by Waller. Harley makes off with Joker after loosing a face off with Deadshot, but Harley's old giant mallet she got from the asylum's storage turns out to carry a dirty bomb Joker hid in it. The remaining Squad members get lost among several Arkham escapees, and Boomerang and Frost supposedly buy it. Deadshot makes off in a police helicopter, which he didn't notice has Joker and Harley stowed away. Batman catches up to them, and the adversaries duke it out in the chopper with the bomb about to go off, with Harley crashing it into a skyscraper. Deadshot knocks Joker into the chopper before it falls to the ground while Batman stops the bomb. Deadshot escapes while being reunited with his daughter, and has his sights set on terminating Waller, even though we never find out if he really shoots her in the end.

This made for a great send up of Smoking Aces with several different bad guys aiming for a similar target, but each out for saving their own skins. Batman is more of a guest star in all this, even though it is great to have Kevin Conroy returning as the Dark Knight. There is some intense action scenes in this, and some serious mature situations(like Deadshot and Harley playing bumper cars), which makes the movie really not for your kids. It's not essential for you to have played any of the Arkham games to enjoy this because it does work as a stand-alone feature. Before you see the Suicide Squad live-action movie, give this one a peak first and see which one works for you.",1454284800,,3734,4.673252279635259

6338593,4,B00J8LXD56,"Assault on Arkham can stand alone as a title without the Batman branding getting in before the colon. Bats is hardly in this movie, reduced to a bit-part player in a grander scheme which doesn't really need to involve him. The Suicide Squad never really interested me and I will probably pass on the forthcoming movie (purely because charisma-vacuum Jai Courtney is in it) but damn to they make for a great team here. I almost wished Batman was stay out of it and let their plans unfold as intended.

Shady US Govt. lady Waller (CCH Pounder) recruits Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, Harley Quinn, Black Spider, King Shark, and Killer Frost to break into Arkham Asylum undetected and steal something belonging to the Riddler before finding and defusing a dirty bomb hidden by the Joker. I'm sure Batman (here, properly voiced by Kevin Conroy once more) would have done a much more efficient job without the high body count, but then we wouldn't have a movie. He and Waller don't see eye-to-eye anyways. It's fun watching them execute their plan and infiltrate the deep recesses of the island. It could have been more atmospheric though. A lot of the backgrounds look to clean and polished. It lacks the gothic pathos of the Arkham City games that inspired it. Batman soon shows up anyways and spoils everything, but does it smartly.

Assault on Arkham is a major step away (and in the right direction) from the family orientated animated Batman series and movies from the 90s. With sex, nudity, and graphic death on show for our enjoyment it's not exactly something you can distract your 7-year-old (if you're really prudish, that is). But I believe Batman should be geared more towards adults anyway.

Joker is voiced by Troy Baker but he does a great job of emulating Mark Hamill's style, and the higher rating allows him to be more violent and evil. The writing could be tighter and it could have had more of an atmosphere, but this one still comes highly recommended, even if Batman's presence sort of spoiled it a bit.

The Blu-ray is in great looking 1.78:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA 5.1 sound and a decent bunch of extras.",1449878400,,2120,4.721621621621622

As an added note the movie was rather graphic in similar vein as the Flashpoint paradox, which I love and want more of in future dc movies. The action scenes were great and really had me engaged.

All in all like the title said, and I know I did a poor job in adding more to sell the movie, If you said yes to all three conditions get it and you won't regret it.",1449619200,,640,4.415254237288136

6338620,2,B00J8LXD56,"I love the Batman: Arkham games. I wasn't sure how an animated feature was going to work out, but I thought it'd be interesting to see the Arkhamverse from a different perspective. ""Assault on Arkham"" ended up being a complete let down.

My main problem with the movie is that it really has very little to do with the Arkhamverse. The ""Origins"" game teased Waller recruiting Deathstroke and Bronze Tiger for the Squad, but neither of them appear in the movie. There's almost no reference to events that took place before or after the film's story. KGBeast is a bat-villain that hadn't been utilized in the games, but the film decides to kill him off early in favor of a team composed of characters that have nothing to do with Batman, aside from Deadshot and Harley Quinn. The film does nothing to expand our knowledge of the universe, or to futher anyone's characterization. The only things that connect this film to the video games are the designs of Batman's rogues (Most of whom only show up at the end during a mass break-out, and have no bearing on the plot), the general layout of Arkham and one quick use of Detective Mode.

The film's not impressive on its own merits either. The premise itself is hokey. Arkham Asylum is notorious for being incredibly easy to break out of, so why should Amanda Waller need the Suicide Squad to break into it? There's nothing wrong with having a story focused on bad guys, but none of them are interesting enough to make up for the fact that they aren't sympathetic. Even the ones who show signs of good character potential end up dead before the story's over.

The film definitely suffers from the loss of Wally Wingert as the Riddler. It's interesting to see Matthew Grey Grubber play an evil character, but ultimately, he can't hold a candle to Wingert, who I consider to be the best VA the Riddler's ever had. Many characters have gone through voice actor changes in the video games, but Wingert is one who's irreplaceable.

If you do plan to see this movie, you should do so as a Suicide Squad fan or as a Batman completionist, not as a fan of the Arkham games. And even then, there might not be much for you.",1441929600,2,2157,4.5372750642673525

The bad parts being there is a few contradictions to the plot early on. We only get a glimpse of a few fan favorites. You're left wanting more from a few of the characters and the plot was weird for the first suicide squad movie. Like why not an origin  or atleast the first time for everyone?

6338627,4,B00J8LXD56,I'm a  huge batman animation fan and this is definately one of the better ones.  It's darker then others I've seen which gives this film a better feel.,1440633600,,151,4.357142857142857
6338628,3,B00J8LXD56,"First, this is not a Batman movie. While hes in it, its really just a Suicide Squad movie thats prepped for a follow-up. I can forgive that from another DC title Batman: Year One, which was largely about someone other than Batman (Jim Gordon) because it felt like the characters were so intertwined.  Batman was an afterthought in Assault on Arkham.

Second, the script needs to cook more. I get what they're thinking: DCs audience has grown up and theres been 3 successful Christian Bale movies. So where else could they go? Yet this one feels like something a writer put together that then got tweaked to DCs broader effort.  They cant be tone deaf to whats going on around it in animation or with comic book movies, but I strongly suspect an earlier draft was much clearer and more cogent.

Third: it's darker. Its much more violent, more sex, more boobs, and more pointless kills. Its crude and a little callous, playing closer to the logic in many Jason movies where, the more interesting kill, the better. Theres little conscience here and Im not sure what the story was.  Sure, everyones familiar with cartoons for adults now, but Batman doesnt make the transition smoothly. Plus, although they place a character in the group thats ostensibly the (sort of) good guy, I didn't find anyone to root for here.

Fortunately, its not as bad as the creepy Batman vs. Robin film.

PROS:

The art, design, animation, action sequences, etc. are all top-notch.  The voice actors all did great and kudos to the director who put together something with some real style and flavor as a lot of animated features feel a little too close to their shot list.  Also, when the villain characters have a chance to escape, they turn on each other. It felt honest to the story, to the characters, and Im pleased they didn't give in to the temptation to promote them all to Good Guys to skip past the confusion of everyone splitting up.

Also, unlike other DC titles, the characters are not treated like The Next Potential Awesome Thing and can die.

CONS

There are some very familiar characters here and probably too many.  Theres Killer Croc (a.k.a. shark guy), Two Guys That Do Martial Arts Or Something, Captain Boomerang (seriously), and Mrs Freeze. Oh and Harley.  Give the women big boobs and borderline stripper outfits and cram in a requisite ""Reservoir Dogs"" slow walk of bad guys that doesn't fit with the rest of the movie.  Since its really hard to work with this many characters and lots of ins and outs, the 3rd act ends up blurry and convoluted. For instance, what happened to the files The Riddler was threatening to release? Does anyone care?

Then there's nothing interesting with the setting: every other Batman I've seen has at least tried to give some credit to the Lovecraftian roots, where this movie makes it just a standard prison.  Arkham doesnt feel like a real place, more of a cardboard, stand-up locale where the story happens.  The guards are the sort of paper mach&eacute; bowling pins that get knocked down, taking away the sense that the Squad is an amazing group of specialists, and more just colorful thugs.

Finally and most painfully the Joker -- one of the best villains in comic books (and a few other places) -- is poorly represented here by an unfunny, dull, violent caricature.  I don't envy the writer/director who has to contend with the very high bar set by previous Batman efforts, but we deserve more.

GOOFINESS

While I can handle ignoring how many bullets are in a clip (thats in here) but this one just makes up the rules as it goes along.  For some reason theres a bazooka in the Arkham basement, all the major Batman villains make an appearance and of course have all their neat stuff (no explanation necessary) with Bane loaded with his equipment to get super pumped instantly. Also hes bulletproof.  Then Poison Ivys kiss makes zombies now and she has a bunch of huge flower monsters. The Scare Crow gets a crazy claw thing for some reason.

None of that turns into anything because we only have 75 mins to cram all this stuff in.

SUMMARY

On my Christmas wish list is for DC to put down the energy drinks.  Stop putting a guy on the production team who says nobody cares about the story, we need more explosions!  Didnt the Nolan movies make it clear you could have something a little more cerebral? Instead, I feel like they're following Michael Bays suggestion that every movie should be targeted to 15-20 year old males. While thats a safe bet for making dough, do you really think anyones going to watch those lame Transformer movies in 10 years? By contrast, I just re-watched the Batman the Animated Series movies from back in the 90s and it held up beautifully.

This movie also suffers from it's contrast to stronger fare coming out of the same studio.  More effort put toward projects like Batman: Year One -- an honest, personal, and unique story with flawed characters that I really cared about -- would definitely grab my time and attention.  .  Assault on Arkham needed fewer characters and more story.",1440547200,2,5058,4.677966101694915

Before you think this review is worthless, hear me out-JUST, hear me out.
I am a LONG time Batman fan and of course the title drew me in, however, Batman is not what is amazing about this movie. I've always been more of a hero fan than a villain fan and I properly despise DCU villains as they are, as per the lives they live. This is one movie that had me rooting for the villains more often than I was for batman. That doesn't mean I'm going to go to the darkside here but the story has everything so neatly tied up in a bow I can't NOT like this movie. Action, jokes, plot, this is just written and scripted so well and geared towards the ""bad guys"" point of view you find yourself frequently asking yourself, ""what the crap is batman doing here?"" and ""can we get back to Deadshot and the rest of the gang, please?"". I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the amount of thought and dialogue that went into it. I found myself cheering for Harley and her bubbly nature quite a bit.

Also, as Killer Frost seem more and more likely to appear in the Flash Series soon, this glimpse of a different version gives viewers added insight into the power and potential of this character.

I tend to like them ,but they usually just feel like a completely different experience than the comics. I love DC comics and the action usually feels great in the comics because you are seeing it in panels and piecing it together in your head making it feel more epic. Most of the times you see these movies and the action is underwhelming and the characters just don't feel the same as when you read them on the page. Maybe that's just because my imagination when I'm reading is constantly creating voices and mannerisms for these characters that gives them personality. However, this movie gave me all that I hoped for and more. The characters were funny, the action was bad ass, and the story felt like something straight out of the comics. I love how Batman was in there only when necessary, because it made all the moments with Batman in them so much cooler. And don't even get me started on Troy Baker as the Joker. Mark Hamill will always be the best Joker ,but Troy Baker will always be almost just as good.

6338702,4,B00J8LXD56,"Despite the title, Batman does not play as central of a role in Assault on Arkham.

It should have been renamed ""Suicide Squad: Assault on Arkham feat. Batman"" Nevertheless a predictable, but entertaining story that offers a fresh vantage point (anti-hero/villain's perspective) in DC's suite of animated offerings. The story is not as deep as ""Justice League Flashpoint Paradox"" but offers something new to even to faintest superhero fan.

Like the more recent DC Animated fare, the animation is more anime-esque, violent and sexually suggestive than the '90s TV censor friendly animated series. NOT intended for young children.

Not a bad thing in itself, but Batman plays such a small part in this, it is almost as if he was added as an afterthought to draw in the fans.  For my tastes, though, the story was too racy, too sexy, and too violent.  This is not what I look for in DC universe animated movies.  There was no real heroism displayed in this story; everybody except Batman was pursuing their own agenda, and it was just lucky for Gotham that their goals overlapped with saving the city and stopping the bomb.  What has kept Batman, and Superman, and Flash and Green Lantern and the Justice League around for almost 80 years is that they are heroes.  They do what is right and they help others.  These are the stories I want to see.  My advice:  pass on this one.",1427068800,2,860,4.189024390243903

The ""Anime"" style animation really takes away from any kind aesthetic someone who is into high quality technical animation desires. and 3. It focuses on sex and violence to keep people entertained (like I haven't seen that before)

Highlight: Kevin Conroy as Batman

Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone that I know, and I don't think I would recommend it to people that I don't know who like this kind of thing, because then it might be a reflection on my taste.

DC and Marvel have done a great job scaling it down, but out of the two, DC takes the cake. Assault on Arkham is a great example of that. Bad guys, killers, psychos going into an Asylum, you have to expect hard language, sexuality and violence, and the movie delivers.

The members are Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Black Spider, Frost, and King Shark.

6338759,4,B00J8LXD56,"Once again Bruce Timm's DCU emerges triumphant with one of the most exciting and fun direct to DVD/Blu Ray Releases.

Taking reference for the first time on a video game, we get Batman: Assault on Arkham. Turns out the government is being held ransom by the clever Batman villain The Riddler and it is up to a rag tag team of villains to storm into the most dangerous place on Earth to retrieve their information. While this film has Batman in the title, he really is not much of a role player in this film. Rather you are taken into the minds of serial killers, maniacs and sociopaths thanks to Batman's coveted rogues gallery. The voice cast is a great one featuring Kevin Conroy, CCH Pounder and Jennifer Hale reprising their roles from the TV shows and a few additional well known names such as Neil McDonough, John DiMaggio, Nolan North and Matthew Gray-Gubbler. What really stood out was the fact that some of the voices used in this film are also the actors that have lent their talents to the characters that appear in the actual video game. The two that stood out for me were Troy Baker as The Joker and Hnyden Walsh as Harley Quinn. They took their talents to replicate Arleen Sorkin & Mark Hamill as best as they could and there were points especially when Joker was on screen that I couldn't even notice the difference.

This movie is not the best, but once again nowhere near disappointing. It is unreal to imagine that this is the 20th installment in this library with no stopping in sight. As a Batman fan, especially being the 75th anniversary this is a must see for you. You will see so many tributes to the Dark Knight in this film in all forms. You will be entertained by the action, and of course the great lines which have seemed to be getting more and more adult oriented with each new film. I am very excited to see the line-up for 2015 especially with the fact that we will be getting two original stories from this crew at DC and Warner Bros. There are still many adaptions that I and many others would like to see, but for now I am ready for next year.",1422662400,,2078,4.394805194805195

6338763,5,B00J8LXD56,"Finally, we have a good DC animated film without Bruce Timm.  Although this should not be a surprise, since it is tied to the Batman Arkham video games series, which is also written extremely well. It was the little touches and attention to details that really impressed me and helped relate to the characters.  I loved the moment with the extra spoon; it was completely unnecessary to add that bit of animation, but it really increased the appeal of these villainous characters to the audience.  The animation is not as lazy as some of the other recent DC films.  The super powered fights make sense when they happen, and don't feel gratuitous.  But that doesn't mean this film is wanting for violence.  They took a less is more approach and it really pays off as the moments of conflict are very intense...  with lasting consequences.

This movie is presented from the villains perspective, and Batman is used sparingly, which leads me to my only complaint.  I wish they could have made it with out Batman being in it at all.  Don't get me wrong.  Batman definitely fits in this story, however, it could have been written Batman-free.  I would like to see Warner Bros. have a little more faith in their other character properties to make a film without Bats or Superman.  If Batman would take a break from animated movies, then I could look forward to his next appearance.

Maybe it's a bit of a stretch to dole out the 5-star rating, but the recent DC movies have been so bad without Bruce Timm's influence that I was extremely excited to see something that I really enjoyed.  I would certainly give it a 4+ or perhaps a 4.5, and since the selections are discrete, I'm boosting that little extra up to a 5.  It's not a good Batman movie; it's a great Suicide Squad movie.",1422230400,,1774,4.5664556962025316

This movie has a quick sex scene, bloody moments, and mild profanity--so if your kid is set on it, they're gonna have to have an understanding of this.

I am not a fan of profanity and sex in animation, especially when children will most likely be viewing it. It seems that both Marvel and DC have lost interest in telling stories without the cussing and sex or some other kind of vulgarity. A shame since it is clear to me that great stories can be told without perversions. Nevertheless, I have to be honest and give credit where it is due.

6338776,4,B00J8LXD56,"A straight forward action flick with a bit of ""The Usual Suspects"" flavor in the guise of the Suicide Squad. That special flavor is one of the reasons that makes this film work. We get to have a different type of main character in a superhero film. Most importantly we don't have the creators twisting normal superheroes and try to make them edgy or new by forcing them to be violent angst ridden adults. This team is not a bunch of nice guys so they will act selfish and self-centered and look out for only themselves. The Suicide Squad is made up of hardened criminals, so expect foul language, some skin, violence and a healthy dose of crazy.  The writing is also decently tight and its helped in this way by the story being mission based and therefore straight forward. The acting is good and I found myself laughing at times at Harley Quinn's antics.

Criminals as hero protagonists is nothing new if you are old enough to remember movies like ""The Dirty Dozen"". The weaknesses of this approach is that with a large cast and it being mostly action based the story is not very deep and in this case there is no time for drama. A story like this often relies on a ""twist"" to give it some freshness to the formula and its often about how the protagonists can extricate themselves from their predicament. The Usual Suspects had both drama as they made us care about some of the characters and a twist, which is what made the movie great. Assault on Arkham lacks drama and there's not much cleverness in the situation or how its resolved. This plus the run time makes the film feel like an extra long episode as opposed to a movie. A competent action flick like this would normally get 3 stars from me, but I had alot more fun with it than say Justice League: War or Justice League: Throne of Atlantis and this is why I'm giving it a bump in grade.",1421539200,,1848,4.400584795321637

It was dark, and it was the Batman story I needed with the bonus of Kevin Conroy.  When he gets to really do Batman in these films there is just so much more edge.  The rest of the cast was GREAT.  What I find interesting is that the actors voicing the Suicide Squad all have the credits and looks to play these characters in front of the camera.  I wonder if they were even given a shot.",1421452800,,553,4.150943396226415
6338779,5,B00J8LXD56,"Is there anything the DC animated universe can't do?  We have a great heist movie where Batman, even though his name is the first thing on the box, does not truly headline the story.  This one is about Task force X, the Suicide Squad, a rotating and ever changing band of criminals and super-villains who are so skilled and dangerous they are seen as potentially useful tools to take on what are essentially suicide missions, hence there nickname; Suicide Squad.  This is easily the most sexual of the DC animated movies so far but it's done in a very tasteful way, still parental guidance is recommended with all these DC original movies anyway.  But as stated before DC and there animation hit another home run on this one; Action, Comedy, Mystery, and of course just to top it off Batman, Kevin Conroy's Batman.

The suspension of disbelief that the movie makers expect you to have is ridiculous, with things that are physically impossible and outlandish even in the comic book world. Pass this clunker up and watch ""Under the Red Hood"" again. I can't understand why this movie has so many five-star reviews, unless those who rated it that have very, very, very low expectations.",1420848000,11,508,4.850574712643678
6338787,2,B00J8LXD56,"I felt that the use of extreme violence (three beheadings, numerous other grisly deaths), ""bad"" language and sex (including a couple references to necrophilia) seemed like a 15 year old""s idea of ""mature"" content.  All of these things were mostly used for shock value, though, to be fair, they help advance the plot here and there.  But clearly, the writer or writers of this depressing 'toon really revel in it and expect fanboys to say ""Kewl!""  Worse, the characters are, for the most part, pretty one dimensional - especially the Batman, who I assume is included to sell more copies of the DVD.  If we are meant to identify with any character, it's Deadshot, an amoral assassin.  Because he carries a photo of his young daughter with him, we're supposed to think he's not ALL bad. Thank you Creative Writing 101.  More distressing, we're supposed to believe that Amanda Waller would rub out a big part of Gotham with a dirty (atomic?) bomb just to kill the Riddler.  I'm not buying it.  Oops - should have said ""Spoiler alert!""  Better yet - don't bother!  Grim and gritty - yawn....",1420848000,8,1086,4.698412698412699

6338799,2,B00J8LXD56,"How you feel about this movie will likely be influenced by two key facts: Its set in the same world as the Arkham Asylum video game, and its badly named, since Batman barely appears. This is a Suicide Squad movie, and some will find that very exciting, while others will be near-disgusted.

I fall in the latter category. I liked the original comic series, written by John Ostrander with a sense of morality and an exploration of various dilemmas around such. The series and concept now, though, is just about forcing bad guys to do even badder things under the threat of being decapitated explosively.

Ive never played the video games, so I cant speak to how authentic this is in relation to those, but the tone here feels a lot like the DC New 52 revamp, from the character designs to the relentless grim feeling and violence. (Plus, hints of sex, as Killer Frost is seen topless from the back; like the other movies, this is rated PG-13.) That certainly has its audience, particularly among gamers. Artistically, Batman: Assault on Arkham looks the same as the other recent DC films - workable, but nothing outstanding.

Batman is once again voiced by the incredible Kevin Conroy, and Troy Baker does a good job of being creepily insane as the Joker. Matthew Gray Gubler is the Riddler, while I was pleased to hear CCH Pounder as Amanda Waller. Unfortunately, while I was thrilled to see her (and in her old look) running the team, were given no reason for her being so mean and bloodthirsty. Other than thats how everyone is in this world.

She sends the team into Arkham Asylum to kill the Riddler, while Batman is looking for a dirty bomb that the Joker has hidden. That accounts for his few scenes, where he threatens various criminals to get more information. The rest of the time, the lightly structured plot just gives villains more chances to be bad guys. I don't find wallowing in this fun; clearly, others disagree.

When it comes to the special features, a nine-minute sneak peek at Justice League: Throne of Atlantis is illustrated with comic art, footage from this and previous movies, and very preliminary sketches. Writer Heath Corson (the go-to guy for these things, since he also wrote this movie and Justice League: War), creative director of animation Mike Carlin, and voice director Andrea Romano also comment. The movies commentary is by Carlin, Corson, and executive producer James Tucker.

The Jokers Queen: Harley Quinn featurette (14 minutes) describes her as the funny and sweet bad girl next door. Geoff Boucher, writer for Entertainment Weekly, explains how the character was created, with help from Mike Carlin. This would all have been much more interesting to hear from Bruce Timm himself, but he appears only in photos. Paul Dini participates. Original voice Arleen Sorkin doesnt. Adam Glass, writer of the Suicide Squad comic, does, and he spends a good amount of time justifying his recent take on the character in print, including his thoughts on the Joker/Harley Quinn/Deadshot triangle.

Arkham Analyzed: The Secrets Behind the Asylum spends 27 minutes on the setting. Too bad we didn't get anything about the other characters that are assembled here or the history of the Suicide Squad concept. There are also four cartoon episodes included: Justice League Unlimited: Task Force X; Young Justice: Infiltrator; Batman: The Brave and the Bold: Emperor Joker; and The Batman: Two of a Kind.

I understand that there is adult content in comic books and their films, but I've seen it tastefully done, and then there was this. Over all, I didn't care for it.

This was a vehicle to promote the Suicide Squad instead. While I am a fan of the Suicide Squad this version did not appeal to me.  Now Warner Bros. has announced they are working on a Suicide Squad film in the few years. A coincidence? I think not! lol

If you are getting this for kids, I would warn that there is some language, sexual suggestion, and very violent. They have a few characters get their heads blown off. There is also a scene where Harley Quinn has sex with Deadshot. As an adult viewer, I was not offended, but I will not let my child watch this until he is in his teens.

6338855,4,B00J8LXD56,"If you're looking for a villain-focused, darker/grittier story, then this should work fairly well for you.

Playing on the DC series ""Suicide Squad,"" which previously made an appearance in the Justice League cartoon series (""Task Force X""), this film follows US government executive Amanda Waller's gathering of a bunch of supervillains to break into the infamous Arkham Asylum to steal critical intelligence back from the Riddler. She's gathered together staple characters from the Squad's history (Deadshot and Killer Frost, for starters), but there's a nice spread of new or little-used faces (King Shark, Black Spider, KG Beast, Captain Boomerang) as well as high-profile rogues (Harley Quinn).

Because this is told from the perspective of the bad guys, Batman barely stars in it. That's not to say he's shoved aside, he just isn't the star of the adventure. When he does show up, it is absolutely worth it (you'll never forget the warehouse fight). Also because this is a mature villain's story, it has foul language, blood, exploding heads, implied sex, that sort of thing. It doesn't go overboard, but it isn't ashamed of what it is, either.

The voice acting and story are solid, and the action sequences are very well done. You get to see a variety of styles, skills and powers, ranging from King Shark's raw strength to Killer Frost's ice powers to Deadshot/Captain Boomerang's marksmanship and Black Spider's martial arts. Very little is left in doubt with these guys.

Again, if you're looking for a hero-dominant tale, look elsewhere. If you want serious violence and barely-tolerating-each-other villains, you've come to the right place.",1415923200,,1652,5.1992481203007515

-just plain silly
-they try to FORCE some 'sexy bits' into this film, but they felt really out of place... and random.
-character are pretty shallow.

I know it says PG-13, but this movie in no way Adult Animation. This thing is clearly for little kids, it's shooting for 10 year olds, and it's subjecting them to things that 10 year olds shouldn't be consuming.  Sex, lots of partial nudity, bad language, graphic violence.

The fact is, these DVDs don't sell very well -- I think if they did, more people would be aware DC/Warners was peddling this awful garbage to kids and there'd be a bit of a backlash. But these straight to video DC things are pretty below the radar.

Kids were robbed because an otherwise appropriate film was ruined by a few vulgarities and sex scenes that added nothing of value.

They take an ice thin plot and production which would be forgivable for kids except the ruin it by adding sex scenes and the use of vulgarities like when the Joker says ""I'm back bitches!"".  The rest of the movie seemed like it was trying to be a kids show because there was not much plot depth or story for the viewer to absorb.

I've also watched Jay Olivia directed movie Batman: The Dark Knight Returns which I enjoyed thoroughly. I felt Dark Knight Returns was the ultimate incarnation of an adult batman animated film.  I've watched parts 1 and 2 several times.  This film could have learned something from TDKR parts 1 and 2.

They could learn a lot of things from TDKR part 1 & 2.  Like if you're going to put sex scenes and vulgarities that push this out of the younger audience you also need to make a smarter plot, production, and better acting value to keep the interest and attention of an adult.

Adults expect a plot with some depth, acting, unique interactions.  This was a would-be kids play that someone thought they were smart by putting in the sex and vulgarities.  Instead, that shuns the kid audience and created a boring feature that just drags on and on with no character development, story, or interesting plot development to speak of.",1412380800,7,1546,4.622710622710622

Shark and KGBeast served their purpose well. The interplay between Boomerang and Deadshot I found entertaining. Villains are more fun because they ""do what they feel in the moment"" and are not brooding or overtly moral. Shark sorta freaks you out for a while and this should not be watched by unsupervised under age kids. Not G rated; another good thing.

If future animated films follow Assault on Arkham's lead, improve animation, and write stronger stories, we are going to get a lot of great films.

6338943,4,B00J8LXD56,"I confess, I never expected to see an R-rated DC comics cartoon in my lifetime. Now, I'm sure they don't rate Assault on Arkham ""R"" specifically but instead has a PG-13 one. Which is ridiculous because heads explode plus sex, violence, and swearing. There's a substantial number of bodies dropped during this movie with cannibalism, decapitations, and being impaled in the face with a grappling hook as just some of the way people die.

  PG-13, my Utility Belt!

  Really, about the only reason I can assume this movie was rated PG-13 is because the characters are all animated so watching the severed head of one rolling across the ground counts less. There's also not that much blood despite the fact there's enough. Arguing about something as subjective as the ratings system, though, is pointless. I just want viewers to know this is the mature side of the DC Animated Universe first. Assault on Arkham is an hour-and-a-half-long movie based on the Batman: Arkham Asylum video game franchise. This is kind of misleading since the Arkham franchise isn't all that distinct from the mainstream DC Universe with rare exceptions. Aside from a few character designs, this could be any of the animated movies that takes place in their own ""pocket universes."" That isn't a complaint, however, as it's still a very well done version of these characters.

  Interestingly, this movie isn't based on the adventure of Batman despite being set in the Batman: Arkham Asylum universe. No, instead, this is more a Suicide Squad movie. Which is curious since they didn't exist in the Arkham Asylum universe until fairly recently. What is the Suicide Squad? Well, my dear reader, it is a collection of DC comics supervillains assembled together by the government to go on missions too dangerous to send actual soldiers. Furthermore, if you refuse to cooperate, they detonate a bomb in your head. Both elements are demonstrated repeatedly during this rather ruthless movie as our villain protagonists are killed rather summarily throughout the movie. This is a dark movie and because our protagonists are ""evil"" it doesn't spare a moment of remorse for any of them. I was actually offended a few times because a few of the characters killed were quite likable as well as ones I'd grown up with.

  Oh well, it's just in this continuity.

 The premise is, as stated, the government (represented by Amanda Waller) assembling a task force to eliminate the Riddler after he's acquired a great deal of information he shouldn't. The Riddler has been captured by Batman, however, and is imprisoned in Arkham Asylum. Rather than request a prison transfer through the legal system, she's instead decided to send a black ops team to break into the place. For once, Arkham Asylum isn't treated as the cardboard prison we know it to be and is as guarded as a Super Max for the Super Insane should be.

  The characters assembled for this suicide mission are Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, Harley Quinn, Killer Frost, KGBeast, Black Spider, and King Shark. Quite a few of these characters will not be making it out of this mission alive but all of them get to demonstrate their personalities, skill sets, and abilities with the exception of one (who I won't spoil gets the ax early). The Joker ends up playing an unnecessary role in the story but, really, given it's his home turf and his role in Harley Quinn's life--I shouldn't be surprised he makes an appearance. The standout performances are Neal McDonough's Deadshot, Hynden Walch's Harley Quinn, (of course) Kevin Conroy's Batman, and Jennifer Hale's Killer Frost. Jennifer Hale actually doesn't get that much to do but I find her voice hits all the sweet spots and have since Knights of the Old Republic.

  I like Deadshot's characterization the most here because he's treated as the only sane man in a gang of lunatics as well as an eeriely calm professional. Harley Quinn is a hoot as always with Hynden Walch stepping into Tara Strong's big shoes quite well. While nothing exceptional, Troy Baker does an uncanny impersonation of Mark Hamill's Joker. If I questioned any characterization, it would be Amanda Waller's as she's portrayed as quite a bit more evil in this film than normal.

  In conclusion, I heartily recommend adult DC comics fans check this one out. It's brutal, dark, sexy, and hilarious even if it's nothing exceptional in terms of plot. I wouldn't let the kiddies see it, though.

""Batman - Assault On Arkham"" is a gripping anti-buddy movie where Batman is present, but is off stage for most of the movie, though his presence is constantly felt by the Sucide Squad who has been recruited and tasked with recovering a crucial bit of information the Riddler has stolen from the government. To retrieve the information for the Riddler, Deadshot must lead the Sucide Squad into Arkham where they soon learn that all is not what it appears to be with their mission, and that the Joker, who is currently an inmate there, has hidden a dirty bomb somewhere in the mental health facility.
Be Warned - there is rather graphic rough sex and violence in this movie,
Highly Recommended!

6338953,4,B00J8LXD56,"Batman: Assault on Arkham is another worthy DVD successor in the line of DC Comics animated movies.  The animation is much better than the cover art leads you to believe.  I don't know why the Powers That Be chose that particular cover.  It's not very eye-catching.

The story was decent and shows a plethora of Batman villains, particularly Joker (who isn't given any cover credit), even though the main storyline revolves around the newly formed Suicide Squad.  These are the characters that we know and love from the pre-Flashpoint, pre-New 52 DC Universe, including a fat, angry Amanda Waller (yay!).  I'm glad to see these versions of the characters, but you have to question DC's motives.  They push the New 52 on comic book readers but continue to make movies with the ""classic"" characters.  If the New 52 characters are that great (and they aren't), then why do they keep using classic characters in their animated movies?  Anyway, enough about my feelings on the New 52 Universe.  I'm just glad to see my old favorites somewhere.

As in the original Suicide Squad series, villains comprising Task Force X are sent on assignment by Amanda Waller into Arkham Asylum.  Naturally, she's using them for her own means and (spoiler alert!) some characters actually die.  The team isn't the original Task Force X (or any version of it since), but it does have a lot of characters who were on the team at one time or another.  There's Deadshot (of course; what's Suicide Squad without him?), Harley Quinn, King Shark, Killer Frost, Captain Boomerang, Black Spider, and KGBeast.  Harley Quinn is a lot of fun and really adds to the enjoyment of this movie.  There's even a sex scene involving her, which helps give solidify this movie's PG-13 rating.

While this isn't a movie that I'd watch over and over or feel that it deserves awards, it provided decent entertainment for a once-viewing.  I'm always happy to see lesser-used characters.",1411516800,,1939,4.859756097560975

6338993,4,B00J8LXD56,"The world of the ""Batman: Arkham"" video game is brought to vivid animated life with DC and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment's ""Batman: Assault on Arkham."" The Dark Knight takes a backseat to the bad guys in what is the comic book equivalent of a heist or search and rescue flick much like ""Red,"" ""Ocean's 11,"" ""Escape from New York,"" and others. The movie takes place after the events in ""Batman: Arkham Origins."" It's an exciting and humorous romp that will thrill fans of the game franchise and ""mature"" enthusiasts of super heroes.

Amanda Waller puts together a team of super villains to infiltrate Arkham Asylum and complete an unfinished job. She wants the Riddler assassinated for secret knowledge he possesses. Black Spider, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Killer Frost, KGBeast, and King Shark are all forced to comply to her wishes thanks to an explosive planted in their necks which Waller can detonate if they won't fulfill her demands.

One thing DC animated movie buffs will be happy about is the return of Kevin Conroy in the role of Batman. The rest of the voice cast is fine, but they're overshadowed every time the Dark Knight appears onscreen. Troy Baker does his best Mark Hamill impersonation as the Joker. I really thought it was Hamill until the credits rolled at the end.

""Batman: Assault on Arkham"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1.78:1) and 5.1 Dolby Digital. The picture is clean and highlights the great stylized animation. I always notice that the DC animated movies have this strange haze over them, but I just overlook it and concentrate on what's going on story wise and below it. The surround sound sets viewers right in the thick of the excitement and tension.

A word of caution to parents out there with children who love super heroes. ""Batman: Assault on Arkham"" isn't kid-friendly in any form or fashion. It's rated PG-13 for violence, sexual content, and language. We're not talking your typical comic book violence, either. Several heads are blown off for example. Harley Quinn shows quite a bit of skin and there's a scene of Deadshot and her tumbling around in bed together. The language is on par with what you would get in any action movie released today starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Liam Neeson, or Sylvester Stallone. However, the ""F"" word is never dropped.

The Blu-ray edition of ""Batman: Assault on Arkham"" contains a pleasing amount of bonus material. A featurette entitled ""Arkham Analyzed: The Secrets Behind the Asylum"" and feature commentary are exclusive to the release. Other featurettes include ""The Joker's Queen - Harley Quinn"" and a sneak preview of the upcoming ""Justice League: Throne of Atlantis"" animated movie. It also contains four bonus cartoons from the DC Comics vault.

""Batman: Assault on Arkham"" will thrill fans of the video game franchise it's based on. People unfamiliar with the ""Arkham Asylum,"" ""Arkham City,"" and ""Arkham Origins"" universe need not worry. I don't play the games and had no problem jumping right in.",1410480000,4,3014,4.99402390438247

If DC could make a live action movie with half the creativity, humor, violence and character exploration contained in this tightly-packed animated flick, they'd finally have a shot at rivaling Marvel. What's great is that this one really keeps Batman in the background and lets a team of lesser-known villains take center stage. If the piece has a protagonist, it's really Deadshot, who doesn't stop being the kind of bad guy who'll shoot a law enforcement officer in the head with a grappling hook just because he's the one in the spotlight. It's got a Tarantino heist-flick vibe right from the opening character intros and never lets up from there on out. Great music, solid voice acting (particularly from John ""Bender"" DiMaggio as an utterly hilarious and almost lovable King Shark). And best of all, (SPOILER ALERT) major characters bite the big one with alarming regularity.

6339018,2,B00J8LXD56,"The DC Animation flicks in general are pretty good, but I think as far as Batman-centric movies are concerned, they really hit their stride with Year One and my personal favorite, The Dark Knight Returns. A lot of people are going to be curious about this film for a number of different reasons, chief among them being the fact that it takes place within the continuity of the Arkham games, and you don't need me to tell you how mind-blowing those games are.

Assault on Arkham has a lot going for it on the surface. In addition to taking place after Arkham Origins, it's directed by Jay Olivia (the guy who directed TDKR), features the return of Kevin Conroy as Batman, and focuses a lot of its attention on the Suicide Squad. How can you go wrong with any of the above? In my opinion, this movie falls short on almost every aspect. It has an interesting story, but it doesn't really jive with the storyline of the games. It seems like they just wanted to cash in on association because the movie doesn't quite acknowledge what came before and it doesn't clue the viewer in as to how any of this could be of any consequence to the games that follow.

Secondly, the content is very dark and intense in some places--there's even a sex scene!--but unlike TDKR or The Flashpoint Paradox, there's a layer of silliness laid on top of it, which made for an awkward viewing experience. One minute, you have Batman kicking the crap out of a paramilitary unit, and then there's a 70's-esque recruiting montage set to Skrillex, and some of the lines that come out of these characters mouths are dreadful. I don't know if I'm the only one who thinks so, but Harley Quinn was handled very poorly in this movie. She's always been a manic and sweetly deranged character, but the movie takes those traits way over the top. They basically use her to cram the comic relief down your throat. As for the other characters, they're not developed enough for the average viewer to care about them, and it's kind of odd that the story calls for derivative characters like King Shark and Killer Frost to fill out the Suicide Squad. That last part is a big deal since we don't see a lot of Batman; by all means, focus on the Suicide Squad, but at least use some formidable villains instead of second rate ones.

I think this movie would have been much better if it was written by someone who not only understood the storyline of the games, but kept the mood consistent. It's like the movie tries too hard to be cool and wants to rub the viewer's nose in it instead of exploring the full potential of the storyline, which is a shame because there are some nice action scenes, and the rivalry between Deadshot and Captain Boomerang is pretty cool. All-in-all, this isn't essential viewing, nor is it an important stepping stone to understanding the world of the Arkham games.

In fact, following around the Suicide Squad as much as it did, it felt a lot like a heist movie a la Ocean's Eleven, which meant the bad guys eventually won over my sympathy, which made me feel kind of sorry for them when they inevitably have to wrangle with The Bat. But even with the quirky approach, I still enjoyed this a whole lot more than a lot of these animated DC Universe direct to video movies. It had snappy dialogue, and some of the fight scenes had better staging and ""choreography"" than some live action movies. I know this is supposed to tie into the continuity from the Batman Arkham video games, but I haven't played them, so I can't comment on how well they do or do not serve that purpose.",1409875200,2,808,4.287581699346405

Other then those personal issues I found it entertaining and so did my son. Characters were depicted pretty well but I feel this movie should have been rated NC-17. Even at 13 there is a lot of graphic violence, sexual situations and nudity. I loved the voice cast they made for this movie. CCH Pounder is distinct as Amanda Waller, and my mind instantly thought of The Shield (which I loved). I fully understand Batman is a dark character and I love that, (I am a Punisher fan).

With Marvel smashing out live action movies i like the fact that DC are sticking to their roots and and keeping the movies animated it seems more in line with the comics.

This latest addition goes a long way to bringing the comics to life with a more grown up animation style and feel,  Something that was seriously missing from Superman Vs the Elite  With the increased realistic animation style and a step away from the more cartoon style, you find yourself more interested in what will happen next and what will happen the characters.  Plus with this film you don;t know who is going to make it to the end of the film alive.

Over the past few animated movies DC have released i love the animation style of this and SON of Batman the most with it's almost Manga style portrayal.

6339064,5,B00J8LXD56,"Batman: Assault on Arkham is definitely one of the more original DC animated movies to come out, if not the most original.  The movie focuses on the Suicide Squad, and Batman serving more as a deuteragonist.  The movie deep.  Not in the philosophical sense, but instead of the way the squad operated, the two main plots and how the protagonist (the suicide squad) flow with and against the deuteragonist (Batman) while both character sets have their own antagonist (Joker/Waller).  At times the protagonist and deuteragonist switch antagonist!

Yes, it gets complicated.  For a ""cartoon"" or animated movie, it stays on shallow grounds, but is deep with the interaction between the characters.  You can tell, once the mission is over, these squad members will not be keeping in touch (unless Deadshot has a baby with Harley...).

I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the part Batman played.  I would love that universe more flushed out, if possible.  The stories are very tied to the video game, but it was just fun to see them before we saw them in the game.  I also like that DC is making their films more enjoyable for adults.  The humor, violence, this isn't the old Super Friends cartoons.  No, I'd say this is an evolution of the cartoons from the 90's (the animated Batman cartoon).

I hope there are more movies like this one in the works.  Having a major character play 2nd fiddle to an interesting (and often under developed) set of characters was nice for a change.",1409011200,,1463,4.746031746031746

The other characters in the outfit were displayed very well.  I thought Deadshot was a little much and overbearing for who he is.  I've honestly never seen him portrayed in such a way.  The star of the show was Harley Quinn.  She explores all sides of her craziness and sexuality, which is all portrayed very well.  I think if they would have taken the gloves off completely, they could have taken the Suicide Squad to the absolute next level.

This show is definitely worth a watch for Harley alone, and Batman plays a fairly minor role, but the parts he is in piss me off with his grey pupils, but his actions, fights, voice...everything is flawless.",1409011200,,902,4.478527607361963

6339068,4,B00J8LXD56,"Batman: Assault on Arkham restored my faith in the DC Animated Universe.  After the whining soap-opera disaster of Batman and Son and the who-needs-plot-when- we-can-have-a-battle that was Justice League War, I had decided that if Assault on Arkham sucked I would not buy anymore of the DCAU films.

Luckily, I will remain a loyal DCAU consumer because Assault on Arkham was great!  The biggest disappointment I can see viewers having is the realization that it is not a Batman film.  With the title being Batman: Assault on Arkham the assumption is an easy mistake to make compounded by the creators saying the film is based on the Arkham Asylum video game universe (a Batman video game series).

Assault on Arkham is a Suicide Squad story with Batman (and Joker) playing a wonderful supporting character who steals the scene but remains a supporting character.  Having read the New 52 Suicide Squad comics, I think the movie creators did a fabulous job crafting a Squad and a story that has mainstream appeal.  Let's face it missions the Suicide Squad face in the comics are out there; dark and weird being the nicest way to describe the insanity of characters' actions.

Assault on Arkham is plotted like a classic heist movie except this team doesn't want to do the job.  The only prize at the end of their heist will hopefully be being alive to serve more jail time.  What makes this movie so much fun is that all of the characters are expendable and the mission is never what it appears.

There's a certain amount of character back story that the creators are banking on their audience already knowing prior to viewing the movie.  Thank god because if you had to give a back story to all of the characters in this movie you'd add at least an hour to run-time.  I think the fact that setup and back story isn't needed is why I'm particularly drawn to DC animated movies.  Give me character and story development.  The dialogue, the character interactions, all of the shared references with the Arkham video games makes this movie a treat for fans. The animation style, the production and voice actors work really well in Assault on Arkham.

I don't know that the movie has a clear conclusion but as a viewer I also don't care.  I just want to see these characters on the screen.  There should definitely be another Suicide Squad movie!  These characters are too much fun to not play with.",1408924800,2,2393,4.681818181818182

In stark contrast to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DCU-Son-of-Batman-HD/dp/B00JM03QZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DCU: Son of Batman [HD</a>], this film does not disappoint, except maybe with it's misleading title.

To be clear this focuses on the Suicide Squad, a band of captured criminals offered time off of their sentences by completing black ops and wetwork missions, orchestrated and lead by the imposing Amanda Waller. In this film, Batman is, more than anything a motivational device to move the plot along and to keep the main protagonists on their toes. Yes, this is the first DCAU film to focus on the bad guys. This is also the first to be set in a pre-established universe, based on the world created in the Arkham series of video games. This inspiration shows in the character and environment designs, and, most notably, with the voices that many people have come to identify as their favorite hero and his rogue's gallery of villains.

The film starts with a vague conversation between the Riddler and Amanda Waller as a squad of soldiers attempts to raid what Waller believes is his hideout, finding only a relayed signal. This raid is soon violently interrupted by Batman, who is also following a trail to catch Riddler. Both Batman and Waller come to the conclusion that the item they are searching for, which Riddler has hidden, lies somewhere within the walls of the infamous Arkham Asylum. For this task Waller calls upon not her most trusted group, but the best suited for the job: the Suicide Squad, consisting of Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, Killer Frost, and Black Spider. Together, they are tasked with infiltrating Arkham, recovering the data drive Riddler has hidden, keep Batman unaware, and escape to deliver the data to Waller.

I thoroughly enjoyed this entry. I have kept up with each DCAU release and this one stands out as one of the best. I recently have been tiring of the constant Superman and Batman films being released over and over, with a Justice League film thrown in here and there, ignoring completely the amazingly large selection of other heroes and stories that a rich for this sort of release. When I found out that there were two Batman films being released for this year, I was rather disappointed. How happy I was to find that this film is Batman only in title cannot be described in words. The reasoning for the title decision is understandable but I still would have preferred for it to be called Suicide Squad.

What garnered my love for this film was mainly how well the squad was fleshed out as individuals, and how they're clashing personalities were handled. As far as a team of criminals goes, this is a very hodgepodge group, each with their own flaws and skills and egos, and the creators played these off quite well between them all, and each character does get enough time to really give a sense of who they are and how they operate. While a few are favored, none are completely ignored.

I also loved the designs for each character, brought to life in a fashion that would be believable for the Arkham games, and truthfully, I can see each of them as if they were in the games. It is always nice to see people pay proper homage to the source material. Batman's design is also right out of Arkham, which has lately been a favorite of mine.

The voices. While only Kevin Conroy retained his role as Batman, the voices in this film are no disappointment. Troy Baker, who did a remarkable job with a Hamill-esque Joker in Arkham Origins, continues to impress with his Joker. Hynden Walch brought a unique tone and style to her Harley Quinn, and Neal McDonough played a very believable Deadshot. I won't go naming every actor and who they played, this isn't the credits, but suffice to say that each actor did a great job, never letting their characters seem flat or uninteresting.

The quality of animation in this film is par for the more recent entries in the DCAU, very detailed characters, very smooth and dynamic animation sequences which can be impressive and almost make me believe that this isn't a typical animation (in the sense that many modern animated features and shows still use a very static and old-fashioned style of animation).

The story is by far the least amazing thing about this feature, which is still good and by no means uninteresting, but is spiced up by the players placed within it. And for once, I honestly felt this movie needed a longer run time, so a little more time could have been spent on building and evolving the relationships with the characters, as there were times when their interactions and scenes felt somewhat rushed.

6339088,2,B00J8LXD56,"Not sure what is going on with DC DTV Animation this year: first Justice League: War -- I can't they believe
they could produce a bad Justice League movie, but somehow they managed to do it. Then this monstrosity. All
I can say is thank god Justice League: Throne of Atlantis is scheduled for 2015. That gives it a fighting chance
(actually from the previews it looks tremendous -- the animation is first rate, and we finally get a story about
Aquaman -- but given DC's track record of late there is no guarantee that even this will be any good).

Does ""Assault on Arkham"" have ANYTHING going for it? Sadly, it does: the animation and artwork are first rate
(particularly the character of Killer Frost, who is given a very attractive makeover). I say sadly, because the beautiful animation
and artwork are wasted on a plodding, boring story, and a group of largely uninteresting characters. I'm not sure why the
writers would chose to include ""Captain Boomerang"" in the cast of characters, for example. Not only is he kind of ridiculous (he's
kind of like Green Arrow -- only instead of using a sharp looking longbow and quiver of hi-tech arrows, he uses... boomerangs),
isn't he a traditional Flash villain anwyay? What is he doing in a Batman movie? The other characters I have never even heard of before --
Kingshark? Deadshot? Black Spider? Perhaps it best that I never heard of them, because none of them are very appealing anyway.

6339092,4,B00J8LXD56,"For the sake of honesty, the studios should have called it something other than ""Batman: Assault on Arkham."" It should have been ""Supervillains attack, featuring batman."" because Batman's actual participation here is more or less a series of cameo appearances.

Modern American culture has given the world the strange creature who has grown up reading comic books and never stopped reading them as an adult. If you are one of those, this is the story for you! It is not for your children unless you have a lot of time on your hands and want to spend it explaining Sex and Death. ""Mommy, are assassins bad?"" ""What was that crunchy noise?"" That sort of thing.

Featuring a few of DC comic's more interesting supervillains, Batman: Assault on Arkham, treats you to a complex, character-driven plot where DC supervillains including Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Killer Frost, The Joker and Captain Boomerang (Who?! WTF?) are pressed into doing black operations by the wildly egotistical government agent, Amanda Waller, who will eventually take to referring to herself in the third person. In this case, the operation is to break into Arkham Asylum and steal an item from its storage section and keeping a low profile while Batman runs around Gotham trying to find a nuclear device the Joker has hidden somewhere in the city.

These are the ingredients of a real roll-your-eyes potboiler, or would be, if the writers hadn't worked hard to bury the plot's deficiencies under action and character development that puts a human face on what might otherwise be nothing but a pile of tired action themes. As things are, the personal agendas of the reluctant team-members leads to a lot of ""Bang!"" ""Swish!"" ""Smack!"" and bits of not-at-all-bad snappy banter that actually works. They give good banter.

The Japanimation itself is competent but clich&eacute;d--with ways of handling lights, darks and the human body that will be yawn-inducingly familiar to anyone who has seen Akira, but you can't have everything.

Thinking about this particular offering makes you realize that it's actually good and, in places, really good. You have to think about it to make that happen, but the reasons for it are there.

The dialogue is often rough.  The Batman reveal is super predictable.  I wish that the Harley and Joker voices would have taken a creative direction, instead of parroting their incredible predecessors.  The Riddler performance is so flat.  Man it's just so boring.  The script is clearly reaching for gritty, since it's really a movie about the Suicide Squad, which is fine, but they didn't try very hard.  They mostly just included a bunch of innuendo and profanity, as if that's all it takes to produce something with edge.  The humor is pretty nascent.  There are a few good lines (mostly from Killer Frost), and that's it.  The face-off between Batman and Waller is weak: so weak that it seemed like filler.

This movie was just bad.  It didn't get the Suicide Squad, it didn't get Batman, it didn't get humor or action or suspense.  It's by far my least favorite entry into the DC Entertainment line-up so far.  Definitely pass.",1408492800,18,1102,4.726315789473684

6339104,4,B00J8LXD56,"Vigorous! This is your typical entertaining comic book film, only this
time you're cheering for, and looking from, the bad guys' point of
view. Amanda Waller (C.C.H. Pounder) assembles a team of six criminals,
called The Suicide Squad. Their mission is to break into Arkham and
retrieve The Riddler's (Mathew Gray Gubler) cane. However it does not
go according to plan.

This film is rated PG-13 for violence, sexual content and language and
I admire this film's judgment. Not long ago, I wrote a blog about the
rating system and how leisurely the ratings are letting mature content
into PG-13 films without forewarnings. I can't complain since this film
gives us a clear heads up! I will say, one of the film's characters
towards the end says, ""Mother..."" and then the audio cuts off. I don't
believe that counts for using the ""F"" word.

The characters are dynamic. As much as I love heroes, I adore villains.
A protagonist is nothing without an antagonist and these criminals take
the cake. Batman villains are unlike your regular, ""Want to take over
the world"" bad guys. They are complex criminals that are assassins,
deranged psychologically, destined to kill and maim for fun, and
sometimes all of the above at once. What's even better, these
characters are lesser known villains such as Killer Shark (John
DiMaggio), Captain Boomerang (Greg Ellis) and more - all with their own
vendetta both personal and business. This creates engaging conflict
between the characters.

The artistry in the animation never ceases to amaze me. Batman's
universe is dark and brooding with lots of shadows and dim lights.
Colors like red, green and purple are done in darker shades and tones
instead of normal bright tones. The characters all have costumes and
designs that define them. Joker (Troy Baker)'s bright colored suit
stands out from the rest of the characters while still looking like a
part of the world he lives in.

My favorite Character is Deadshot (Neal McDonugh). Deadshot is the
leader who only wants to be with his daughter. He's cunning, a sharp
shooter and deadly. He even manages to get into Joker's mind and
outsmart him. That's impressive.

My favorite scene is when the squad is up against Batman (Kevin
Conroy). This takes place in a building full of confiscated belongings
from the criminals of Arkham. So if you're a comic book fan, like me,
see how many different Easter Eggs you can spot. Plus this is one of
the rare times you see Batman do what he does best.

I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommended it to 13- through 18-
year-olds. As I mentioned earlier, there is content that is
inappropriate for younger kids.

6339115,4,B00J8LXD56,"Batman: Assault on Arkham is a welcomed addition to the DC comic universe, although the movie was created for a more mature audience. Set in Gotham, the movie focuses on a government endorsed special task force led by Deadshot with Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Black Spider, King Shark, and Killer Forst where they must infiltrate Arkham. The movie has quite a few one-liners, though for the casual fan not enough background information is given on the characters to understand who they really are besides a quick snippet of Deadshot's picture of his girl (shown in the first few minutes). I say the movie is for a mature audience as there is nudity in movie 4 times, with one of those times being a sex scene, along with exploding heads and quite a lot of animated violence. The sex scene is quick and does not show full bodies, though you see enough to be wary of having little children seeing this after they've fallen in love with Batman Begins or another batman title. Troy Baker as the Joker is fantastic, along with the other voice actors such as the one and only Kevin Conroy.

6339134,4,B00J8LXD56,"In July of 2013 at the San Diego Comic Con, the DC Animation Panel announced BATMAN: ASSAULT ON ARKHAM as a fall 2014 release, intended to tie-into Rocksteady Studio's latest ""Batman: Arkham"" game - which at that time was set for an October 2014 release. It sadly reeked of DC/Warner Bros. interdepartmental cross-promotion, and left little for fans to look forward to.

Fortunately, the talent assigned to the film had their own agenda with regard to what type of film they wanted to make. When it was decided the plot would focus on sending the Suicide Squad into Arkham on a mission, everything began clicking. Co-director Jay Oliva, who looks for distinct stylistic approaches for each of his films, saw the opportunity to turn the DC Universe Film into one unlike any other - a Guy Ritchie stylized pic: ""Normally, I direct epic, sweeping animated films, but this one I wanted it to be more like a Guy Ritchie film. If I'd directed like I'd directed an earlier project I'd done in the past, it might not be so good, so I pitched it as a Guy Ritchie film or a Soderbergh film. Like ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"". So that's how we did it. Even the music isn't done in the operatic style, the Hans Zimmer feel. It's more contemporary, and it made it more fresh. It was a challenge."" (www.flickerkingmyth.com, SDCC Interview: Jay Oliva, director of Batman: Assault on Arkham, AUGUST 4, 2014 BY GARY COLLINSON)

Screenwriter Heath Corson wasn't just a fan of utilizing the Suicide Squad in the film, he was in total sync with director Jay Oliva's `Guy Ritchie' heist approach, and had a specific Steven Soderbergh film on the brain as well: ""I said it's sort of like ""Ocean's Eleven "" if, at every step of the way, Brad Pitt is trying to kill George Clooney...They really liked that and they wanted me to go in that direction. ... I realized I had pitched a heist movie and heist movies are super hard, so I had to build it from the ground up...It's not an adaptation (of the video game), so I had a little bit of a freer hand to (pace it) as fast as I could...Also, because we're doing a heist movie, those things are breathless. They gotta move so quickly that you're just keeping up. So that sort of was baked into the concept, that it needed to move as fast as it possible could."" (www.animationmagazine.net, Heist Style, AUGUST 8, 2014 BY THOMAS J. McLEAN)

And move it does.

An action-pact opening involves Batman (legendary Kevin Conroy back in great form) defeating Government Agent Amanda Waller (the great C.C.H. Pounder) and her attempt to capture Edward Nygma (Matthew Gray Gubler). Once directors Jay Oliva & Ethan Spaulding, along with writer Heath Corson, set-up their plot, and the film hits the 32 minute mark, it's an insane, dark, profane, sexualized, hilarious, sick wild ride, right down to the last notes of Robert J Kral's energized end titles, which equal the balance of his greatly varied, highly stylized overall score.

Once you're a half-hour in, BATMAN: ASSAULT ON ARKHAM moves faster and hits harder each minute as it builds upon and exceeds the previous 60 seconds. Like the best work of Guy Ritchie, Steven Soderbergh an Quentin Tarantino, the film hits that stride of outrageous unpredictability. That line-shattering mix of the entire gambit of humor, combined with 'traditionally' inappropriate subject matter that drives America's conservative, senior citizens crazy when they accidentally stumble into it at the cinema.

In this case? A hilarious scene with a couple of exploding heads, and a certain villain who picks one up -post dismemberment from its body - for a casual conversation. An Arkham Guard who is suckered via a VERY partially nude female Suicide Squad member, only to end up facing off with the `Jaws' of a hilarious cannibal, who announces after eating the guy, ""He hates Italian.""

If your tastes include films such as Ritchie's SNATCH, Soderbergh's SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE, and Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS, PULP FICTION, INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and DJANGO UNCHAINED, odds are high while watching BATMAN: ASSAULT ON ARKHAM, you will find yourself unable to restrain your own verbal reactions.

Don't be surprised if the film's countless, unexpected, and character-motivated moments of perfectly mixed hilarity, one-liners, horror, over-the-top violence, sex and vulgarity elicit verbal responses such as: ""Oh no they didn't!""; ""Holy (fill in your favorite expression)!""; ""Now that's how it's done!""; and countless other reactions (from G to NC-17 rated, depending upon your tastes and whomever else is in the room).

Jay Oliva has noted, ""I'm a huge horror fan. I would watch ""R""-rated films that I was way too young to watch, and I think that kind of influenced me a little bit...I love ""The Shining"" and ""The Exorcist"". I've done a film here that is very psychological, and I tried to hearken back to what I loved as a kid. I tried to balance the videogame feel to the heist movie and a little bit of scary elements at the end. It's my nod to Sam Raimi and John Carpenter. I've been asked how I took on my directing style, and my style comes from studying the greats. You learn something from everyone. I've tried to integrate everything."" (www.flickerkingmyth.com, SDCC Interview: Jay Oliva, director of Batman: Assault on Arkham, AUGUST 4, 2014 BY GARY COLLINSON)

With the goal of the Directors and Writer being to make a film in the style of both Guy Ritchie and Steven Soderbergh, it should come as no surprise that BATMAN: ASSAULT ON ARKHAM is the most flat-out violent, sexually graphic, profane, dark, twisted and ADULT DC Universe Animated Original Film ever produced. The film is laced with several moments of partial nudity, exploding heads with blood splattering, corpses taking gunshots, a heated night of sex for 2 characters, violent knife and chain-hook fights with bloody body impaling. BATMAN: ASSAULT ON ARKHAM makes Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT look like Joel Schumacher's BATMAN & ROBIN.

The MPAA must have found Oliva, Spaulding and Corson's first 30 minutes of plot `set-up' so hard to follow, they fell asleep. More than any other DC Universe Animated Original Film, this one EARNED an ""R"" rating. Furthermore, its seems that - in just this one case - Rocksteady Studios and DC Universe Animated Original Films would have WANTED an ""R"" rating on the film. It hits the demographic of the ""Arkham Game"" series, and it would have gotten the film and upcoming 2015 ""Batman: Arkham"" game some real publicity.

This isn't to say the film is perfect. Following the opening action sequence, the plot set-up could have used much more `one-liners,' humor, and tighter editing. A surprise early plot appearance by one of the Gotham's Rogues is a nice touch.

These are minor flaws. What could have been nothing more than a throw-a-way promotional tie-in, Directors Jay Oliva & Ethan Spaulding, along with writer Heath Corson, Casting and Voice Director Andrea Romano, Composer Robert Kral, and the entire cast - especially Kevin Conroy - deserve high praise for delivering one of the best and unique DC Universe Animated Original Movies since the days of Bruce Timm. The praise doesn't get ANY higher for a DC Universe Animated Original Film.",1408233600,8,7221,4.909016393442623

This one is an action packed romp filled with some great twists and turns and featuring the Suicide Squad in all their glory. The cast assembled here is great and they nailed every character.  Harley is amazing and steals every scene... and Deadshot kills it as a seminal badass. The rest of the team is also great in their roles as well.

This also is a great animated entry in to the Arkham world as well. Doing a great job of telling an original story set in that familiar universe. I hope they do more Arkham animated features in the future because this one was amazing. Also... the vibe this one has is similar to a hardboiled 70s heist film... spot on.

Finally... i have to say this one really pushes the PG 13 rating. Language...sexuality... and mature subject matter permeate this feature... but truthfully. .. that's how it should be... the Suicide Squad is a mature themed book so anything less would've been a bad representation.

6339156,2,B00J8LXD56,"This has been a rough few years for us DC fans.  The New 52 was disastrous, The Man of Steel was underwhelming, and the one bright spot - Young Justice - was cancelled after 2 seasons.  And then they nix Batwoman's wedding, leading to charges of homophobia at a time when Marvel is seeing record profits at the box office and opening itself to new swaths of the market.  So, is Batman: Assault on Arkham going to provide a salve for our fresh burns? If you're looking at the number of stars at the top of this review, you probably already know the answer.

Let me begin with the praise: The animation is gorgeous.  Obviously anime inspired, the faces are expressive and some character designs (The Penguin in particular) are genuinely compelling.  The action/fight scenes are fast paced and exciting with the occasional flash of brilliance, such as when Killer Frost rides the back of King Shark to guide him like a tank.  And I am happy to see the old Amanda Waller back after DC decided she needed an 'upgrade' for New 52 - I'm glad one of the most interesting women in comics - not quite a hero, not quite a villain, and able to hold her own with Batman - was rescued from being another attractive action girl. (More on that in a moment.)  Having Kevin Conroy voicing Batman again feels right, like putting back on a pair of well-worn comfortable jeans after breaking in some newer, stiffer models.

Unfortunately, that good doesn't nearly outweigh the bad.

Full disclosure, I'm not the biggest Batman fan.  Some of that is hype backlash.  Some if it is simply that his rogues' gallery has always been the most interesting thing about him.  Let's face it, we see The Dark Knight to see The Joker, not Batman.  BUT I do generally enjoy the DC Batman animated features, and to my mind the best full-length animated superhero feature ever created was Batman: Under the Red Hood. Yet, this really didn't need to be a Batman title.  It's a Suicide Squad title.  If DC should have learned anything form Marvel Studios' success, it's that you don't always need to trot out the biggest players to get a great return.  I mean, two years ago, could anyone have pictured a Guardians of the Galaxy movie smashing box office records?

The result is that what would have otherwise been a fairly good movie about a group of selfish villains working together gets a Batman subplot shoehorned in.  His scenes, ironically, are the least interesting.  Just as the interplay between the band of psychopathic misfits is reaching a crescendo, the film has to stop dead in its tracks to make room for the main character.  This is the first Batman movie that I can unequivocally say would be better without Batman.

More jarring than The Bat, though, is the undercurrent of sexism and objectification that runs through this movie.  At some point in the past few years, DC has come to embrace the same definition of maturity as an adolescent boy.  The female characters are often nearly-nude (as close as their PG-13 rating will allow) for little to no reason than to appeal to the male gaze.  Whatever goodwill was redeemed by Amanda Waller is squandered as the two female members of the Suicide Squad are A) given nearly no characterization besides crazy sexpot and femme fatale, B) have no interaction with one another whatsoever, and C) Harley Quinn, who has the majority of the lines, spends almost the entirety of her dialog pining after The Joker or her new beau, Deadshot.  Harley Quinn in the comics has undergone a LOT of character development since being introduced in Batman: TAS - what happened to all of that?

(Before the accusations fly, no, I'm not a prude.  I have no issue with well-done nudity or even a little titillation - but this was just the worst sort of pandering.)

And while I know they have to up the tension when things start to go awry, there's a real skills disparity when the villains are just showing off and when they are actually in a fight.  Deadshot, in particular, is shown to reach superhuman levels of competence - his pissing contest with Captain Boomerang during a game of darts is the high point of the film.  Yet during combat he misses far more often than he hits.  His admonishment that the group will not get out of Arkham alive without him rings hollow when he's just spent a large number of bullets shooting at the feet of lackey security guards.  Especially when he's giving this speech to Black Spider, a ninja assassin that is clearly shown in the beginning to specialize in infiltration.

And Captain Boomerang . . . oh, Captain Boomerang.  Without giving away too much of the plot, it's a miracle they didn't get kill him at the first opportunity.  I understand the need for comic relief, but it feels as though they didn't stop to consider the characters they were dealing with.  Heroes might have a compelling moral reason to keep the millstone sidekick alive - Villains have no such compunctions.  Nor was it ever indicated that killing one of their squadmates was grounds for being terminated from the program.  Too often I was left scratching my head, wondering why Deadshot hadn't put a bullet in this bumbling jackanape's pupil.  Guess he couldn't get a clear shot.

Overall, some beautiful animation and inspired choreography couldn't save this one from thoughtless character development, an uneven plot, and glaring objectification.  If you're really jonesing for some animated DC, go  get yourself the box set of Justice League and Justice League: Unlimited and remind yourself of a time when DC was on the forefront of animated storytelling, not lagging behind and resorting to gimmick and brand recognition to stay relevant.",1407974400,6,5671,4.732179226069246

Hynden Walch - Harley Quinn
Neal McDonough - Floyd Lawton / Deadshot
Mathew Gray Gubler - Edward Nygma / The Riddler
Kevin Grevioux - King Shark
James Patrick Stuart - George Harkness / Captain Boomerang

Nothing like The Batman with the PROPER voice! This is Justice League/Justice League Unlimited/Young Justice level animation at its best, but this is NOT FOR KIDS!  Very adult with language, adult situations, nudity, etc.

I have to admit that Mr. J and Harley are as awesome as ever and are a major highlight of the movie.  Especially since they are both written just as they should be and so crazy you can't help but love them!

Whenever Batman shows up, it's unexpectedly, and as the Suicide Squad go on with their mission, I was on the edge of my seat knowing that Batman could show up at anytime.

One thing I should mention is the violence. This is probably the most violent animated DC film since TDK Returns. It's not for kids and it should be rated PG-13. Or is it? Not sure. Anyways...I highly recommend this film for the witty dialogue, and most of all, the excellent direction by Jay Oliva. He sure knows how to cut a film! And did I mention the art design and animation?

6339170,5,B00J8LXD56,"Batman: Assault on Arkham is a fresh take on what has felt like a series of rather stale entries into the DC Animated Universe. This movie holds few punches, and will keep you watching throughout the entire 76 minute run time. However, if you've come to this movie expecting a deep, thoughtful plot, you'll probably be a little disappointed. The plot is shallow, but this movie keeps a fast pace to make up for that.

Speaking of the story, we get to see several villains that really haven't been present in much of the animated material relating to Batman. As far as the synopsis goes, these villains essentially band together on a suicide mission in which they have no other choice. Batman: Assault on Arkham follows these villains as they attempt to accomplish the mission that they've been forced to take apart of. Oh, and as an added bonus The Clown Prince of Crime is thrown in for extra measure because it can't be a well rounded Batman film without him. Him and a handful of cameos from other staple villains. It's cliche, cheesy, but just what the doctor ordered.

In terms of animation, it's nothing special, but I found it to more fluid than some other recent entries such as Son of Batman. All in all, the animation is well done and shouldn't disappoint. For the voice acting, I was satisfied with each of the characters. The Joker was the highlight in terms of the voice acting, but Kevin Conroy doesn't fall far behind. Each character sounded unique enough, and they all sounded just right.

If you've bought any of the DC Animated Universe movies in the past few years, you should pretty much know what to expect in terms of packaging. A box with pretty artwork, two discs: Blu-ray and DVD, and a digital download code. In terms of extra features, you'll get the standard offerings: a preview of the next film, behind the scenes stuff, trailers, and a feature on a DC character. The menu music is still the same earth shattering rumble that I've come to love (and my neighbors hate).

DC Entertainment is unfortunately using Batman's name to cash in on subpar material.

However, spend the money and get this, for sure! For me, this is the first time where I am specifically aware of Kevin Conroy and purposely sought to key in on his voice as Batman since I now know what he looks like and have more background with understanding on him. One of the coolest elements of this are the images that clearly come from the Arkham video games so everything ties together very well. The voice acting is done very well, of course, and DC seems to represent the polar opposite of what Marvel provides Maybe it is because of the disney factor, but Marvel is much more lighthearted than DC, as if disney is trying to make EVERYTHING about Marvel family friendly. DC does not portray itself with this concern, and Assault on Arkham reflects this. Knowing this, this film is not for children due to the language and the building towards nudity and sex that are taken as far as possible without actually slipping or stepping into those arenas that would raise the rating for it. A nice chunk of Batman's rogue gallery is shown, even if only temporarily, and that only adds to the appeal since those names are not introduced in the marketing.

Heads up to parents of younger kids, but because this is a Batman movie it isn't for the very young, this movie is Very PG-13 so keep that in mind, and it really is more of a Suicide Squad movie then a Batman movie, and odds are that is one of the reasons I liked it as much as I did.

For those that don't know The Squad is made up of villains that the US government blackmails into doing questionable jobs for it. So this movie features mostly villains how are not inherently nice people.",1407715200,3,733,4.228571428571429

Tho it's not based on the game you'll get to see a few characters with the game design. Action packed beginning to end, full of excitement.

6339182,5,B00J8LXD56,"I've been a fan of DC's animation since JL/JLU.  most of their animated features have been excellent, and this one is no exception.  this one is different in that it's based on the Arkham games, rather than being in-continuity with DC/WB's other features.

it's also based on Suicide Squad.  that's a beyond-top-secret government program that takes a group of supervillains, implants bombs in them, and sends them on impossible missions as expendable agents.

THIS IS NOT A KID'S MOVIE.  brutal violence, nudity, profanity, sex, and more violence.  the protagonists (you can't call them ""heroes"") are unrepentant killers and thieves, motivated only by saving their own skins.  the plot involves searching for Riddler's MacGuffin while avoiding Batman (who is searching for a different MacGuffin), and trying not to die.

it's filled with witty writing, subtle and effective character moments, tense infiltration scenes, and massive fights.  voice acting is perfect, music is FANTASTIC, and the directing and editing both set the heavy tone, and lighten the tone when needed.

oh, and the Joker.  this is possibly my favorite portrayal of the character since Batman: TAS.  when bad guys have nightmares, *this* is the Joker they wake up screaming about.

as noted in just about every other review, this isn't really a ""Batman"" story.  he's in it, but he's a supporting character.  Deadshot, Harley, and Joker steal the show (then they moon the cameras, burn down the set, and hold the audience hostage).

I actually rooted for Deadstroke and the other villains to give Batman a hard time because he never loses fight.  Good to hear Mark Hamill reprise his role as the Joker and Kevin Conroy return as Batman.  I am also liking the fact that these movies are less PG and more PG-13 with the language, violence and even the sexual content bars being raised a few notches.  This is the best DC movie I've seen since the Red Hood movie a few years ago.  Hopefully the next Justice League movie will be on a par with this movie.  Thought that movie was all over the place and the characters were not likeable.  Hopefully, hopefully, DC will give us a Batman Beyond movie updating that universe like the comic book has.

I note that most of the people who didn't like this movie were put off a handful of very mild curse words, implied nudity, and some sexually suggestive dialog.

Awesome!  A new spin on the Joker, Harley Quinn, and other villains.  If you have watched Justice League Unlimited this is a great way to keep it fresh as there is lots of cross-over characters!  Action, fights, and twists we were both happily suprised!

Sort of like a mish mash of other action themes mixed into a super hero movie....without giving it away.  Also strangely you end up rooting for and liking some of the villains!  Lots of great voice actors, and a decent sound track.  Overall very Good writing, and fun.

But so far it's been used only on cartoons and superhero tv shows. I'm glad Kevin Conway is doing the voice of Batman again, I always thought he was the best. This is not a film for kids, it is very violent and it has non graphic sex in it. The best part of the film is the battle between the Joker and Deadshot.

That movie still holds up today well above what they have recently made. I don't know who to blame. This movie just felt rushed, so maybe it was the studios fault Maybe they know we will buy whatever movie they churn out with Bats on the cover, so why take the time to actually make something worth watching. The story was boring and I cared nothing about the characters.

Also all the ""jive"" talk was off putting. I know there has been a trend to spice up the characters by making them call each other douchebags or have Joker say ""What's up Bitches"", or slut up Harley. This trend doesn't give me much excitement for future movies. Refer back to Mask of the phantasm. You don't need to take the characters in that direction. Just make a good story!

And while Batman is in it, it's not all about him. Instead he reminds us that he is the thread that keeps Gotham from getting worse and his moral compass and hope is still his best strength...and having Kevin Conroy voicing is always a good thing.

Some of the characters I am not familiar with and while I welcome new, it made me not really understand what they were about.  Harley Quin has been around so I didn't need her story, but I have never heard of Black Spider before so I was hoping to get an idea of why he exists and they really only slightly hinted in one line.

6339243,5,B00J8LXD56,"After hating on Son of Batman so much, it only felt fair to come back and talk about just how much I loved this movie.

First off, a caveat: this movie is hysterical, and has great combat, but you kind of need a dark sense of humor. Characters get crushed, stabbed, and murdered in brutally different and creative ways, including multiple heads getting blown off. Cops, doctors, innocent civilians, bad guys, they all die. However, there is an absolute glee to all of it. Crazy as it sounds, the people working on this actually seemed to be enjoying themselves having terrible people do terrible things to other terrible people.

To recap the premise in a fairly spoiler free way: Amanda Waller works for the U.S. Government, and when she needs something done that's crazy, illegal, and likely to kill those involved, she recruits a Suicide Squad of convicts. Succeed, less jail time. Fail? Well. That's what the name of the group is for. The movie opens with a new bunch being recruited to storm into Arkham Asylum to retrieve an item held in an evidence room. From there, it becomes a heist movie, with Batman more in the background, as things steadily grow more and more insane, ending with a full-on prison riot at the world's safest and loveliest of insane asylums.

I can't stress enough how funny this movie is (and not because of shocking stupidity and incompetence, like with Son of Batman). The banter between the members of the Suicide Squad is fantastic. The intro is full tongue in cheek as it introduces the various members, and the music is high energy, perfectly suiting the movie. All throughout are nice little touches. Killer Frost is saved during the fall into Gotham by King Shark? Cut to the next scene where she's riding on the big oaf's shoulder like she has a new pet.

In short, it's a heist movie featuring B/C list villains, hilarious banter, and solid action. Oh, and Amanda Waller as how she was always meant to be portrayed (*grumble stupid New 52 reboot mutter*). Despite a few hiccups, such as a rather easy escape for the Joker as well as a blatant ""we'll claim the Joker survived although you know he had a 0% chance of actually surviving that explosion you saw"" at the end, I had a ton of fun start to finish, and I really can't ask for much more than that.",1406764800,5,2293,4.599022004889975

6339245,2,B00J8LXD56,"I Would give it two and a half stars, but apparently amazon won't let me. Now, before i start this review, you must know that I am an avid batman fan who reads the comics, has played the three arkham games and love pretty much anything batman. With this, being pretty much the only exception. The reason it as two starts is because 1.5 stars for the animation and a whole star, ""BECAUSE HE'S BATMAN!"". Now onto why i think it is one of the worse animated batman movies.
1) No Batman
The first thing you'll notice halfway through the movie is that this is not ""Batman Assault On Arkham"", Rather ""Suicide Squad: Assault On arkham"" Batman has maybe 15-20 minutes of screen time out of this 1:20 minute movie. And honestly, even 20 minutes is a great exaggeration of the time the movie actually spent on batman. Now i have nothing against the suicide squad, in fact I really love them but i feel the title was misleading. Not the biggest con, but something that definitely was noticed.
2) No Character Development
Okay so out of all of the suicide squad members (I think there are 7? Don't remember plot was too shi**y) the only real back story-ish thing you get is a picture of deadshots daughter, That's it. Literally. All the other characters have literally NO back story or character development AT ALL! Even deadshot (The main character of this movie surprisingly) DID NOT GET ANY CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AT ALL! It's not even funny how if every single member of the suicide squad was murdered by batman at the end of the movie YOU WOULDN'T GIVE A SH*T!
3) Terrible Plot
Remember ""Spiderman 3""? It's hard to say this but that movie had a better plot than this. The plot is virtually Non-Existent. There is really no end goal to this movie. I'm gonna try and write this trying not to spoil, but seriously due to the lack of character development and back story, there is no plot at all. Basically, the suicide squad gets a mission (a STUPID mission I may add) and they have to finish it. No reason why in the start, and in the end the reason makes you think you wasted your time. Trust me when i say, this movie has one of THE most  under-developed,  unsatisfying and BORING plots in the DC or Marvel animated universe.
4) Did not live up to expectations
Now, i expect mostly people who have played the arkham games to watch this movie, I mean really who doesn't wanna see those games animated into a movie right? Wrong. This movie takes the great arkham games and their story and is thrashing their reputation by how terrible this movie actually is. I could not wait for this movie and after watching I felt honest disappointment by the quality of the movie (Tremendous animation btw ). I (Like many other arkham fans) Thought this would be the movie we were waiting for, but turns out it was just another disappointment.

All in all, this is my LEAST favorite animated superhero movie and feel it could have been much better if some actual thought went into the plot.",1406678400,10,2967,4.511152416356877
6339246,3,B00J8LXD56,"I enjoyed it but there was not much plot to speak of. Whole thing just seemed designed to get the characters in one place to fight. There was some much needed maturity in this with some sexual references and a brief sex scene.
Much of the plot there was made no sense and batman was more like superman when he fought the gang. Way too  powerful. Anyways the animation was good and i liked the gang of criminals for fun.",1406678400,3,419,4.2375
6339247,4,B00J8LXD56,"I really enjoyed this movie, it's a bit short (Hour and 20 mins). Just the same it tells a fun story about the Suicide Squad. Batman is in the story but it doesn't focus on him. It is still very enjoyable and Batman is spliced in throughout the story. In addition it gives some lesser known Batman/DC villains.

All the voice acting is top tier and the animation is fluid and crisp. If you enjoy the majority of the DC Movie catalog, I'm sure this will be up to standards.",1406678400,5,472,4.2444444444444445
6339248,5,B00J8LXD56,"I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Mt one complaint, although I understand the reasoning, is that this is miss-titled. Before you watch it, think of this as a Suicide Squad movie, Batman is not in this too much, and acts as more of a background character, and a plot device. He basically is a convenient way to move things forward. Once again, I'm okay with that. It was great seeing characters that I am less familiar with and allowing them to take a front seat to the action. The humor is spot-on, and there were a number of times I laughed out loud. The voice acting is great, and it was fantastic to have Mr. Conroy back in the cowl, also, Troy Baker is just phenomenal. There were a couple of moments where I wasn't actually sure if it was Baker or Mark Hamill. While the movie itself should be titled Suicide Squad: Assault on Arkham (which is a much cooler sounding title) that doesn't stop it from being great, easily a step up from Son of Batman and possibly even JLA: War, although we'll see if it's still as much fun the second time around.",1406678400,68,1047,4.374358974358974

6339250,5,B00J8LXD56,"Fantastic film. It's centered around the suicide squad with batman mixed in. I don't want to ruin the movie so no spoilers. Fantastic action sequences especially hand to hand combat. The story was great also. If your a fan of DCAU, this is a great action packed film.

What I do notice is that this movie was a little more Rated R vs PG13. There wasn't any explicit nudity but it was close, definitely not suited for young children. Also, there was more violence and blood which has been consistent since Flashpoint Paradox. Awesome violence and blood, not for kids though. To me, this latest release was edgier and more adult oriented vs the DC animation I used to watch as a kid.",1406678400,3,681,4.536585365853658
6339251,5,B00J8LXD56,"This is one of the best Batman movies made worth watching. Loved the style, and most of the dialog was good. This is way better than son of Batman. worth owning. It is PG13 so It is not for children but is is great addition to the DC animated universe.",1406678400,4,252,4.06
6339252,5,B00J8LXD56,"This BATMAN feature is really super cool because, as the audience we get introduced to some new characters which make up
TASK FORCE X,...like,.. CAPTAIN BOOMERANG,...and yes he is Australian!
A rouge government agent has compiled a team of Gothem City's worst convicts,serving life sentences with no hope for release,
EXPENDABLE agents for suicidal missions.
Their mission; ...to defuse a dirty bomb the Joker has stashed in ARKHAM ASYLAM .
The movie is great if you are a BATMAN fan ..It is a great movie no matter if you are a fan or not,...it has a really cool plot and great new characters.
Its edgy and not for young children ,...definitely a young adult comic film !
This version comes with about 50 mins of bonus footage and cost the same as the standard version, so why not have the extra material??...its well worth it !!!
If not the best animated BATMAN movie,.. it is up in the top 3 !!!

I LOVE YOU HARLEY QUINN !!!
!HEY DOLL DROP THE JOKER AND GET WITH A REAL FUNNYMAN!!!

(yes) for you smarta$$es out there (I know its just a cartoon)

LOVED IT***",1406592000,2,1061,4.515625
6339253,5,B00J8LXD56,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this movie!  Granted, the bar for movies adapted from a video game franchise is pretty low, but this is easily the best one ive seen.  Even compared to other DC animated films, which are all pretty good movies, i think, this one stands out.  It has a lot more mature content than any others, what with it focusing on villains, the Suicide Squad, as main characters instead of any heroes, and it uses the fact that that it is set in a video game universe instead of the same universe as the movies to kill off notable DC characters.  This creates a sense of danger and suspense that is sometimes lacking in superhero movies. With good action, animation, music, and story, Batman: Assault on Arkham is definitely worth a watch(just be sure mind the PG13 rating if you are a concerned parent)!",1406592000,9,827,4.5675675675675675
