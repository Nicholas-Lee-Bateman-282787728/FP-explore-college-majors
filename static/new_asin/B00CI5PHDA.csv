5722503,5,B00CI5PHDA,"This really is a nicely done collection of Alicia Keys with both the DVD to view on a TV and the CD for the music. The quality and sound of the DVD is very good.  I like the arrangement on this, and Girl on Fire is especially good.  I can see viewing this over and over for many years.",1374537600,,285,3.8135593220338984
5722504,5,B00CI5PHDA,"If you already like her music, this is right up your alley.  She makes the audience feel like she's a personal friend.  She talks about her motivations for some of her songs.  All in all a winner",1374364800,,195,4.216216216216216
5722505,1,B00CI5PHDA,"I am dissapointed with the sound quality of this disc and AK really doesn't deserve it.
Sound is out of sync with picture and it's very annoying.
AC3 mix is awful. Center is almost silent, everything is comming thru left and right front channels, surrounds are almost silent.
DTS MA is missing - that is unacceptable.

Very bad job.",1373846400,6,332,4.627118644067797

5722526,5,B00CI5PHDA,"I've been a fan of the Unplugged series for a long time and I was happy to see one of my favorite artists, Alicia Keys, was doing the show.

5722532,5,B00CI5PHDA,"I first watched and recorded this fine concert on the ""Story Tellers"" program almost a year ago.  This is a great series that showcases contemporary artists in a small studio setting (similar to HBO's ""Unplugged"" concert series), and they could not have chosen a better performer for this venue than Alicia Keys.  Alicia performs approximately 10 songs, each of which are preceded with pertinent commentary about the background and/or inspiration for the composition.  She performs a diverse collection of her popular songs, some from the most recent album, and several hits from previous recordings, and it all combines to provide a concert-worthy presentation that all of her fans (and any newbies) will thoroughly enjoy.  As such, I was ecstatic when I discovered that this great performance was being issued on DVD so that I can have a copy to play many times in the future.  And, as an added bonus, the DVD includes several songs and that were not included in the television show, which makes this DVD a MUST HAVE for anyone who loves great R&B music !!!",1380240000,,1059,4.893854748603352

5722535,5,B00CI5PHDA,"I love this concert, she sets each song with a story about how her team of musicians came up with the beautiful lyrics, sounds, and soulful power. I highly recommend it to any Alicia Keys fans and everybody searching for inspiring, empowering and beautiful love songs.",1376697600,,268,4.8478260869565215
