Then every once in a while, he'd flash back to early  childhood, and he'd be standing in the middle of a circle of children who  were chanting ""hi ho the derrio, the cheese stands alone...""  Rent it if you think there's more to the movie than I've found, but I  wouldn't reccomend it.",961632000,2,447,4.116279069767442
