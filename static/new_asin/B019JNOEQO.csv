7575897,1,B019JNOEQO,"There is a war for ice/water on the moon. The water on earth has become contaminated and apparently it is easier to find water on the moon than it is to filter an ocean full of it on earth. The battle is between two groups called the Outlaws or Banished and the Unlights with differing religious ideas. A group of the Outlaws (good guys?) are ambushed while in transport and are forced to walk on foot when they make a discovery at the end of the movie in an attempt to justify the bad film we just sat through.

This next paragraph will contain plot spoilers/details....The outlaw group has odd religious affiliations such as ""Gnostic Islam"" and ""Hinbuddhist."" The science fiction lacks science but not fiction. There is an awful lot of noise being made in a vacuum and a lot of fire without oxygen. The one sixth gravity didn't seem to help anybody walk as they moved as if they were on Earth (most likely where they filmed it.) What they find is something that upsets the religious status quo concept of a creator, or ""Almighty Outlaw."" Shades of 2001. Then they talk about it in a dimly lit crater and the film ends. BTW The ""dark side"" of the moon has the same amount of light as any side of the moon. It is simply called that because it always faces away from earth, and we can't see it. You wouldn't get that impression from the movie as the dark side is constantly dark.

7575899,3,B019JNOEQO,"It's ok as a background movie, I enjoyed it while also surfing on my laptop. Most of the action happens in the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes of the movie. We are never really explained who is fighting what and why until towards the very end of the movie, but it does not matter anyway since pretty much nothing happens in between - for the most part, it is soldiers aimlessly wandering in spacesuits and engaging in pointless dialogs. When it all finally starts to make sense and gets somewhat interesting - we are shown the final credits. Video and audio quality is pretty good for it is, and FX does not look too bad either.",1452384000,13,637,4.361344537815126

7575909,2,B019JNOEQO,This could have been better if they had simply used computer generated characters. All the FX and props are just low budget amateur quality. The script leaves you wondering what's going on most of the time and the fact that no member of the cast can actually act makes it that much worse.

7575924,3,B019JNOEQO,"This is a visually dark movie.  Because of that it makes it a little difficult to watch.  But, unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't have a problem with the movie itself.  Considering I'm in the midst of an ice storm which has been preceded by weeks of snow, anything that reasonably offers a lift from the tedium of twiddling my thumbs makes for a bit of a change.

The only other thing that I felt was odd was the ""style"" of spacesuit these soldiers wore.  They looked like rejects from Goodwill store Halloween costumes.  On the scheme of things, there's a lot that could have been worse.",1484784000,,598,4.440366972477064

Okay then there is the female bad arse writing on her bullets but after they crash land from an unknown missile strike she come face to face with a blurry what ever it is and just stands there frozen til another bad arse female comes to her rescue, I think it was the Asian female that is shown crying in a shower minutes before they crash land, not to mention a space suit that looks like they used card board box's.",1481241600,,767,4.019607843137255

But a lot of the other technical stuff seemed ok, like the space ships, satellites, drones,  and weapons.  The actors also seemed to grow into their roles -- as the film progressed, their performances became more authentic.

Even if you don't like this movie, the story of why religion and war are so intermingled is an important one.  We should always be reminded of the real tragedy and sacrifice that is war.",1476316800,,512,4.7727272727272725

Why were 2 groups killing each other. Then the staging was the hokiest I've ever seen starting with the square helmets in which the actors looked like puppets with their faces stuck inside and the ships and crash were unimaginative.

7575953,2,B019JNOEQO,Shockwave Darkside wasn't as good as I had expected.  computer graphics seemed to get int the way of the story.  The picture was too dark to be able to see anything.  The story never really had a sense of direction and you never saw the enemy.  It seemed a little far fetched that the human race was divided between those who had a religion and those that didn't.  The ending had a revelation of whether or not God had created the condition of life on earth by having an asteroid explode near the moon to put it in the right orbit around the earth which helped life to start and develop.  90 minutes of my time that I will never get back.,1473552000,,638,4.188524590163935

First off, the caption pretty much says it all; a squad of soldiers gets shot down on the moon and they must walk back to the base. Not enough air, and hostile forces assail their every step. The ""space suits"" look like painted cardboard, and even though they're supposedly on the moon, they walk and move normally without any apparent effects of low gravity. The actors attempt to cover this enigma by making a big show of making ""adjustments"" to their suits to simulate normal gravity because in doing so, they would conserve air...??? I guess those ""adjustments"" also changed the physics surrounding their whole area; debris, dust, and weapons all fall normally too. It was all just really hokey. Even if this vid had the budget to do some plausible low gravity effects the plot and action (what action there is) was still ninety minutes or so of watching the actors plodding along as they race against low oxygen supplies and a constant barrage of enemy fire; fighting back with weapons that look like they bought the props at Toys are Us.

Where the badguys who wash the scene with indiscriminate laser beam salvos are also utterly allergic to using cover and are somehow content to stop firing and walk right up next to you before trying to shoot you at melee range.
Where, if you triangulate the incoming salvos of blaster fire, the good guys are not only completely surrounded but taking fire through hills, vehicles, each other...
Where good guys don't duck or react when rockets whiz right past their head or energy weapons spang off terrain within arm's reach.
Where the badguys shoot somebody with the slow blade that pierces the shield just to force the harry potter gal to tragically off their squaddie with a mercy round... So of course the baddie mook just walks up to them and shoots, not the gal with the gun, but the poisoned guy... because tactics?
