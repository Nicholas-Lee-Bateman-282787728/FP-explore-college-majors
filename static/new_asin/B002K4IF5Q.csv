8371731,2,B002K4IF5Q,Alcatraz Reunion was an OK documentary. I just wish it was longer & I also wish to have heard from more inmates especially Willie Radkay. John Dekker was funny. I don't know if he was kidding when asked what he would say to his victims if he had the chance. He would tell them he's sorry & rob them all over again (Chilling) It was interesting to hear the ex cons & guards stories & also getting to see them revisit the island. Watching this made me want to visit Alcatraz & see the sights,1432080000,,489,4.157894736842105
8371732,4,B002K4IF5Q,"I also gave this 4 stars out of 1 because of the some ex cons tell you their experiences life behind the 4 by 9 ft. cell homes they had while doing time on Alcatraz Island there new home as known as the (hell) to some of the them. Plus the guards with work/time living their wives and children on the aka (the rock) until it shutdown in June 1963. Long before year I was born in 1985; and a year after the (BIGGEST ESCAPE) done by Morris and the Angling brothers in (Alcatraz History)! How all of their lives changed after leaving the home that they ever knew called the rock. By its actual name is Alcatraz Island San Fransisco. I think, maybe a couple of guards and cons are still alive today.",1371859200,,695,4.1940298507462686
