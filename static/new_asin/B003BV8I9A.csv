8393989,2,B003BV8I9A,"Back when I was a teenager with raging hormones, I thought 2069: A Sex Odyssey was an entertaining and funny film. When I saw that the film was released on DVD, I purchased it for nostalgic purposes. However, I was somewhat disappointed when I discovered that this version was edited. If you want a copy of the original film in its entirety, do not waste your money.",1463529600,,366,4.477611940298507

8393993,2,B003BV8I9A,They are as described but the quality when they turned three 70's B-rated movies into a DVD has a lot lacking there are lots of sparkles video lines running thru out the dvd. I would not recommend this for anyone else to purchase.,1379548800,4,230,4.372093023255814
8393994,3,B003BV8I9A,Typical movies for this genre and era.  Some nudity and lot of schlocky acting make for an entertaining viewing for fans of low budget movies.,1370563200,5,142,4.68
8393995,3,B003BV8I9A,"2069 is entertaining and fun, this set has what I consider a good quality 4/5 print of it, but unfortunately the other 2 films on the disc are really bad quality prints, and pretty bad films to begin with, I can't name the films in this set as my review keeps getting rejected for saying the title of the film, no extras aside from a handful of trailers.",1289865600,6,354,4.220588235294118
