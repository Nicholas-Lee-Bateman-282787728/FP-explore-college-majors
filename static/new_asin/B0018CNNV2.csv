but a real body, who moves into a college sorority as house mother
of Zeta house , the most unpopular house on campus.
Full of empty sex jokes and cliches about boobs and butts, this movie
has very little beside visual gags to go on.
The acting is minimal dumb blond standard and the plot is predictable.
I suppose people will buy it for the giggle and giggle appeal,
but it really turned me off.",1227312000,3,459,4.168539325842697
3415441,4,B0018CNNV2,"When i first saw the trailer for this film it reminded me of Legally Blonde, Sydney White, She's the Man, and others. This movie for me was intersting, for there are real people in society like in the house of Zata. They feel like there in low parts of society, but just to get out of their shell and feel confident for themselves was an amazing thing to observe. Yeah they look sexy, but it took more than just looks. Women shouldn't only be a sexy object for men, they need to help out their fellow sisters and show that all girls in society are equal and beautiful. I hope that this DVD will bring what the guys will want. Us guys should be able to own and love this movie, just like women do. I feel everytime this movie plays I just sit back, enjoy the comedy, and just feel like your sexy. You know what they say about bunnies that multiply.",1227052800,3,847,4.2024539877300615

Even worse, you could see where a really cliche comic opportunity was coming and you thought to yourself,""no, they won't go there, they won't pander like that"", and before you could finish thinking the thought they went there.  Two twelve year olds could have written this screenplay.  I admit, there were parts that were funny .. but you can watch the preview to see those parts.

3415444,4,B0018CNNV2,"When I first heard about this film, I was less than impressed and had no intentions of seeing it.  Once, however, I saw the preview at another film, I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did.

""The House Bunny"" is a charming and funny little film starring Anna Faris as Shelly, a playboy bunny who lives a carefree life in Hugh Hefner's mansion.  After her 27th birthday, she finds herself suddenly evicted from her perfect life, unaware of how she can make a living.  When she stumbles onto a college campus and discovers that sororities slightly resemble her former playful lifestyle, she becomes determined to be the house mother of a failing sorority full of misfits and unpopular girls. Through her determined spirit, willingness to encourage others and using her sexuality in a positive way, Shelley works her magic and helps her girls to become of the belles of sorority row. And in the process, the young women teach Shelly some valuable lessons as well.

Faris gives a good comedic performance, giving the character a sweet, likeable naivety.  I liked that the character wasn't bitchy or a diva, simply a kind girl who lived an exotic life but must now adjust to her new situation and envirnoment.  The supporting cast is funny but the brunt of the film falls on Faris, who delivers and proves she can carry a film.  Notable supporting characters include Rumor Willis (the daugther of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore)former American Idol alum, Kathernine McPhee and Colin Hanks, son of Tom Hanks.

This is a fun date movie and I recommend it as a perfect summer comedy movie.  Worth a trip to the theater!",1223164800,32,1614,4.691489361702128
3415445,2,B0018CNNV2,"""The House Bunny"" is a giddy, girlish daydream that doesn't have two gray cells to rub together within its platinum blonde head. Pretty much as the ads promised. Of course, the fact that it's true to itself doesn't make it worth recommending. If that were all that mattered, I'd be giving out a lot more five-star ratings. There's nothing redeeming about an intentionally bubble-headed movie, especially when it's at pains to tell us (1) that it's a comedy, and (2) that the title character is dumb. We don't need wall-to-wall jokes about a young, sexy blonde not being able to pronounce ""philanthropy"" or thinking that the question, ""Who are you voting for?"" somehow relates to ""American Idol."" And we certainly don't need to see her fail at trying to be smart. It's all so obvious and overplayed that it actually sidesteps being funny and stumbles into a sinkhole of monotony. It's not that this movie is offensive or vulgar--it's just plain boring.

The plot: Shelley Darlingson (Anna Faris) has been living the good life as a Playboy Bunny ever since she was eighteen. Before then, she was an acne-scarred, braced-toothed orphan that no one wanted to adopt. Then she blossomed into a super sexy young woman, and before long, she moved into the Playboy Mansion with dreams of one day being a centerfold model. All that changes the day after her twenty-seventh birthday; apparently, Hugh Hefner sends her a letter, one that tells her to move out. According to the Mansion's resident cocktail mixer, being twenty-seven is fifty-nine in Bunny years. Out in the real world, Shelley happens to come across the sorority houses of a college campus, and lo and behold, the pathetic, unpopular, run-down Zeta house needs a new House Mother. It also needs at least thirty pledges in order to keep operating. Shelley, in all her wide-eyed ignorance, becomes the leader of the Zeta house. She then oversees a complete makeover of both the house and its sisters, turning them into the most popular sorority on campus. Along the way, Shelley learns the value of true friendship and that you don't have to be something you're not in matters of love.

How exactly does one become a Sorority Mother? Is the process really as easy as walking in off the street and announcing yourself as one? Never mind--this movie doesn't bother with such things, anyway. Nor does it care to explain how Shelley and her Zetas manage to pull of some of the most elaborately themed parties, or how they can afford expensive new dresses and hairstyles with no apparent source of money, or how they no one in administration knew she was even there. The best we're given is that she gets by with her feminine assets, and boy, does she have them. We know she has them because every piece of clothing she owns is more than a little revealing. It isn't long before she introduces the sisters to her dress style; the most gung ho is Natalie (Emma Stone), who's desperate to impress the love of her life, a frat boy named Colby (Tyson Ritter of the All-American Rejects). Yes, Shelley makes a significant impact on the girls' lives, and Zeta is certainly a lot more popular than it used to be. But at what cost? Have they somehow become even more superficial than their House Mother?

Why am I even asking these questions? The real focus of ""The House Bunny"" is how dumb Shelley is. I know, that's not the politically correct thing to say, but when you think a brothel is a place where you make soup, I'm afraid I have to call it like I see it. The jokes targeting her lack of knowledge are piled one on top of the other, and it only looks worse when she tries to act smart. Yes, I get that that's the point, but really, couldn't the filmmakers have told a couple of other jokes? Did they all have to be about her knowing everything about looking sexy and nothing about anything else? It gets so tiresome. So does her advice on maintaining relationships. At one point, she tells Natalie that guys don't want to date smart girls. But when Shelley begins dating a gentle young man named Oliver (Colin Hanks), she learns that--surprise--not all male college students are perverted sex hounds. The seemingly only decent guy on campus actually wants to get to know her as a person, which she initially can't understand. Neither can I. Who wants to know someone that uses a demonic Yoda voice to remember people's names?

The saddest thing about ""The House Bunny"" is that it's no better than it wanted to be. The filmmakers, I suspect, knew exactly what they were doing. That's fine, I guess, but don't expect me to accept it on those terms alone. If you want me to laugh, give me something other than a litany of blonde jokes. And for God's sake, don't cast Beverly D'Angelo as a vengeful Sorority Mother from a rival house; she's so much better than this. I have a feeling every one of the actors is better than this, even the beautiful Anna Faris, who's always so sluggish under the weight of her badly-written dialogue. What more can I say about the story, which is really nothing more than a clothesline to hang dumb-person jokes on? This is the kind of movie that makes you say to yourself, ""Someone actually directed this."" But it's worse than that; before a director came on board, someone actually wrote it. Screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith must be very confident people, because goodness knows doubtful writers would have lacked the nerve to shop this script around.",1221696000,6,5448,4.689655172413793
3415446,4,B0018CNNV2,"What a light, funny and surprising treat! Well, I love Anna and am so glad to see her do this (reminds me greatly of a young Goldie Hawn) I was amazed how well Katherine McPhee did for her first time out, she is drop dead gorgeous and a rising star for sure. All the girls were good,we laughed and at one point I nearly laughed so hard I could have tinkled! Well worth the price of addmission and it's a shame it came out alongside Tropic Thunder etc as I am sure it would have done even better in the ratings. Took #2 and held for awhile so that was good! Go see it then buy it! Worth it!",1221264000,2,589,3.957983193277311
3415447,4,B0018CNNV2,"I have a confession to make.  Listen closely because, after this, I will never repeat this sentence, ever again:  I secretly love screenwriters Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah Lutz, the two women who not only wrote this screenplay, but also She's the Man and 10 Things I Hate About You, among others.  These stories aren't by any means the kinds of movies I usually watch, unless I'm dragged to them.  But, for some reason or another, the humor contained within each tugs at my funny bone.

Now, for another not-so-secret mention: I love Anna Faris.  I think she has terrific comedic timing and while she might be a one-trick pony in her character choices, she plays them very, very well.  And she consistently makes me laugh.  I mention this because, when the three women above are placed together, I will surely follow.  And follow I did.

House Bunny is one of those stupidly funny movies that qualifies as being a guilty pleasure.  We've seen this story told a hundred times and it doesn't do anything new or add anything substantial to the formula.  But it is filled with laughs, oddly endearing characters and provides Anna Faris the ability to do what she does best: making dumb characters funny and lovable.

This should be a movie rated far below what I gave it, but I'm sticking to my guns.  I mean, you obviously can't compare it to other great films out there.  And it's definitely not comparable to other movies I've seen this summer that I might give the same rating to.  But in the genre of dumb anti-feminist female brings a sorority house to greatness, it's the tops...

Take that as you will.",1219968000,6,1611,4.636042402826855
3415448,5,B0018CNNV2,"I'm not usually a chick-flick type of guy. I'm more into horror, comedy, and action, but on rare occasions, I'll make an exception! The House Bunny was awesome and very funny! Anna Faris and all the girls did a really good job, and were REALLY HOT! There was one part in the movie where I laughed 'til I cried! Anna plays Shelley, a Playboy Bunny who is thrown out of the mansion because she thinks Hugh Hefner thinks she's too old. Shelley leaves and finds a sorority to become a House Mother. She becomes the H.M. of some nerdy girls at Zeta. Unless they get 30 pledges soon, they will lose their house. Shelley gives the girls confidence and they all become EXTREMELY HOT!

3415449,4,B0018CNNV2,"I just saw an advance screening of the film and trust me, this film is worth your time. I won passes through my local newspaper and since I like Anna Faris, I decided I'd go anyways. I was VERY satisfied with the film. Anna Faris plays Shelly, a Playboy bunny who is considered ""too old"" for Playboy and is booted from the mansion. After a brief stint which results in her in jail, she is released and goes to a college beta house, where she teaches 8 unpopular kids how to be popular among the boys. Overall, the humor was great, it was nice seeing her taking on a more challenging role than the Scary Movie movies. There were a few moments that could be tightened up, but overall, it's a cute movie, there's some great laughs and it is worth a look if you like these kinds of movies.",1219276800,5,785,4.24

I shouldn't like this bad movie as much as I do but it's really pretty hysterical. Anna Faris nails it by not being a caricature, and I will probably hear her say ""CINDERELLA"" in my head until my dying day (and will laugh every time). Don't get me wrong, I already used the word bad and I mean it - there are some extra corny parts, it's another Happy Madison film so you know Adam Sandler has thrown all his buddies cameos, and there are definitely parts that are not only not plausible, they just don't make sense. But still, if you can laugh at stupid jokes as well as highbrow humor and are a little quirky, there's a good chance you'll like this movie.",1487548800,6,879,4.201183431952662

I disagree with the reviewers who think that this movie is about being pretty in order to succeed.  This movie is about being yourself, and the message about rejecting traditional notions of beauty and attention for beauty were clearly conveyed.  (The sorority sisters rejected their makeovers, and the Anna Faris character ultimately rejected her life as a centerfold.)  So I was pleased to see all of the positive messages about being an original and standing up for what you want.  I only gave it three stars because at times the Anna Faris character was just too superficial, and the cinematography was mediocre.

3415772,4,B0018CNNV2,"I am giving this movie four stars, not as a movie amongst all movies, but only within its own genre. I enjoyed this movie and thought the writing overall was smart. I would also say that all the negative remarks about it being sexist and a bad example to girls tells me that the people who wrote these reviews did not watch the movie all the way through, or are super thick. The movie is actually moralistic and has good messages for children, mainly, be who you are, and not who others want you to be, which includes playing gender roles. Kids are smart enough to figure this out, but apparently not all adults can. My only criticism would be that as a comedy, it needed more comedy. The jokes in it were good, but it just needed more comedy, because even though the movie was very good in general, in the end, this is supposed to be comedy and not light drama.",1463529600,,862,4.294478527607362

3416099,3,B0018CNNV2,"The House Bunny (2008) stars Anna Faris as playboy bunny, Shelly, living at Hefners infamous mansion. When shes unexpectedly ousted after her 27th birthday she gets a gig as a house mother at a USC sorority where Shelly encourages a group of geeky girls by giving them make-overs, etc. Beverly D'Angelo, Colin Hanks and Hugh Hefner have side roles.

The plot is similar to 1984s Revenge of the Nerds in that a group of nerdy youths get revenge on their popular crowd persecutors. The difference here, of course, is that the nerds are girls at a sorority rather than guys at a fraternity, not to mention the presence of a playboy bunny as their leader.

I wanted to see this movie the second I saw the trailer because it made it look like an entertaining movie and it is, to a point. Amiable Anna easily carries the movie with her winsome, nave personality while Emma Stone is equally effective as the leader of the geeks. Kat Denning, Katharine McPhee and a couple of the other actresses who play the nerdy girls are also good. It's a well-made, likable dramedy with -- thankfully -- no raunch. The problem is the script and the corresponding flow of the story. It never really engaged me and, as such, the movie never rose above mildly amusing. Another problem is that the filmmakers failed to take advantage of the female resources at their disposal, except for Faris. Dennings is underutilized and McPhee is pregnant the entire movie, which was unnecessary because theres no appreciable payoff to that particular subplot.

If you want to see a really good dramedy about sorority girls check out 2005s Man of the House.

The film runs 97 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, including Playboy Mansion and USC.

She is cute, funny, sexy, and in this underrated movie she shows why she is (in my opinion) the best comic actress in the world. She brings a sweetness to the part, not just a trampy sexy girl but a girl with a heart and a soul.

3416404,4,B0018CNNV2,"One of the other reviewers compared the movie to a combination of Legally Blonde and Revenge of the Nerds.  That is pretty accurate.  Fans of Anna Faris know that she has very good comedy acting chops (from the scary movie franchise and Waiting).  She is definitely not afraid of saying or doing something totally stupid and ridiculous.  She pulls off the ditzy Playboy Bunny, with a kind heart and smarter than she seems quality very well.  There is definitely not a lot of depth to the character she was trying to play, but what depth there was, she played it well.

The movie has mix of stars who have become A list or B list (mainly Emma Stone and Kat Dennings which the movie did an awesome job of making look plain and downright unattractive respectively before the ""makeover"") with reality tv stars, musicians and lots of cameos from celebrities.  Even though it was not meant to be a movie that was going to win the actors any awards, the fact that at least some of the stars had the ability to act made it as good a movie as it is.  It is definitely not a movie designed to make you think, and it is definitely making fun of the whole fraternity/sorority culture.  It did not try to do too much and pretty much stuck to the comedy that it was meant to be.

This is not a movie that will appeal to everyone.  It is for the most part a mindless comedy that is not meant to, or try to make you think very much.  It had a lot of cute girls in skimpy outfits and/or showing lots of cleavage.  If that is not the kind of movie that entertains you, skip it.  Otherwise, it is definitely entertaining enough to occupy an hour and a half of your time and give you some laughs.",1370736000,,1676,4.262658227848101

Then ex-ESPN sports anchor Dan Patrick shows up as a cop (say what?).

Throw in Hef and ""The Girls Next Door"" women, and it's a veritable party of B-list celebs.

Colin Hanks must have got a nice paycheck to show up in this disaster of a flick.

Hey, I love B movies but this has virtually no laughs. It's basically Legally Blonde redone on campus by worse actors and even worse scriptwriters. It does have a lot of scares (Rumer Willis's face for starters).

But there the similarities really end, because the plots are different.

House Bunny is an enjoyable movie if you're amused by a ditzy-acting blonde teaching ""sexy smarts"" to a bunch of university misfits. Revenge of the Nerds broke new ground back in '85 when it made nerdliness cool, but Faris' Shelly and appearances by Hugh Hefner himself define House Bunny as anything but a me-too film.",1292025600,,852,4.875862068965517

3416521,4,B0018CNNV2,"""House Bunny"" is the silly story of a Playboy playmate cast from the Playboy mansion through a misunderstanding. She goes off to become a sorority mouse mother and takes a dozen losers, turning them into beauty queens and making them the envy of college boys and other sorority sisters. The film looks like it's going to have an unhappy ending but it winds up much differently.

That's about all there is to this 2008 film, which by modern standards is a throwback to classic screwball comedies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-Happened-One-Night-Remastered-Black-White/dp/B001GUYAZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It Happened One Night (Remastered Black & White)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Midsummer-Night-s-Dream/dp/6305622876/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Importance-of-Being-Earnest-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00006673M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion Collection</a>. These films, both the originals and remakes, rely on slapstick, farce, situational and romantic comedy to draw in their audiences and keep them involved. They also do not insult the intelligence of their audiences. And so does ""House Bunny.""

The enduring qualities are all on display in here abetted by a magnficent comic peformance from Anna Faris, one of the best comic actresses in Hollywood who was so good in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smiley-Face/dp/B000WCN8QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smiley Face</a>&nbsp;where she played a stoner trying to land a job and instead ending up in hilariously funny situations. For male viewers, there is another extra: Faris's fabulous figure, barely but tantalizingly covered by the skimpy outfits she adorns.

Faris isn't the whole show here. She is helped by good support from Colin Hanks (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orange-County/dp/B000065U36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orange County</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/11-14/dp/B000ALM40I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">11:14</a>) who plays her budding boyfriend, and Emma Stone (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerer-s-Stone-Ultimate-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B002GJT4XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombieland-Blu-ray/dp/B002WY65W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombieland [Blu-ray</a>]), the most astute of the Zeta sorority sisters, who morphs from a turnip to a rose under Faris's tutelage but helps her mentor learn the world or love and relationships.

This is a darling movie with almost no objectionable content or characterisitcs. It is full of scenes of young women in tight dresses and brief outfits, and there are a plethora of scenes of sorority parties but little overt sexuality and no sexual scenes. This is a homespun film about a young woman with a big heart that learns how to make good decisions and passes them onto her mentees, who in turn help her become a better person.

I liked this film a lot; it is much more entertaining than pretentious big budget movies I've seen recently including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inglourious-Basterds-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B002T9H2LA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inglourious Basterds (Single-Disc Edition)</a>.

The House Bunny revolves around Shelly (played with absolutely perfect wide-eyed certainty by Anna Faris), a 27-year-old Playboy bunny who gets kicked out of the mansion and is forced to fend for herself. With precious little skills and intelligence in her repertiore, Shelly decides that her perfect job would be house mother at a sorority. That's how she ends up at the Zeta Alpha Zeta house, where a group of misfit girls must pledge 30 new members or face losing their charter.

Luckily for these oddball coeds, Shelly is a master at makeovers, partying, and giving guys what they want. Before the girls know it, Zeta Alpha Zeta is one of the hottest tickets on campus, and Shelly's found herself a new home.

Of course, there are complications and personal growth (and even a birth) along the way (blah blah blah), but what makes this movie worth watching is Faris' performance. The girl is, quite simply, one of the best young female comedians in Hollywood. The collection of actresses playing the sorority sisters are fun, too, with Emma Stone nailing her portrayal of Natalie, the goofy, bookish president of the Zetas.

Worth seeing. This ain't life-changing, just funny.",1273449600,,1508,4.925196850393701
3416556,2,B0018CNNV2,"--Raunchy or not?--

The movie has a couple of raunchy bits early on:

- The Anna Faris character misunderstands a request from a cop to blow into a breathalyzer as a request to blow him.

- Later, the Anna Faris character walks around the sorority house in the nude and the audience sees her butt.

The rest of the movie could probably be watched by a family together comfortably.

--Be yourself or change?--

The movie also can't decide if girls should try to be like the Anna Faris character or just be themselves.  One of the girls decides she wants to be ""60%"" like the Anna Faris character.

The Anna Faris character builds her vocabulary in the middle-of-the-movie in an effort to impress a guy.

But she gives a speech in the finale about how everyone should just be themselves.

Was she wrong to build her vocabulary?

The movie is a mixture between raunchy and not-raunchy, and a mixture between the messages of change-yourself and be-yourself.

I like the cast and the premise.

But the movie would have been better if the director went more in one direction or the other in terms of raunchiness and the message.",1273449600,2,1123,4.611111111111111
3416557,2,B0018CNNV2,"Let's first look at the life of the film's producer Adam Sandler for a moment please(it will become clear very soon,I promise).We have a man who is clearly unattractive and unathletic but through pandering to the twits who actually like his films he was able to marry a hot model and live happily ever after(at least until he decides to be a schmuck and upgrade).Why the bio?Because 90% of Hollywood films are made by men like Sandler who cling to a fantasy that if they weren't wealthy and famous they would still have gorgeous women at their feet. Only the catch is that the women didn't start off that way. They were nerdy girls who stayed home on Friday nights memorizing pi and playing D&D,but they were secret babes just waiting for their geeky dreamboat to come along, take their hair out of their ponytails and their glasses off and turn them into instant sexy Cinderellas.
  This is why when a film is made about geeky guys becoming cool and popular(a la ""Revenge of the Nerds"")they achieve their goal by staying true to themselves and actually create a new form of cool which is superior to what the sterotypical popular kids have to offer. Contrast this when the same situation is applied to the ladies:the only way they can become cool and popular is by conforming to society's standards,in short they must abandon a large part of themselves. The ""Nerds"" did not become popular by having Arnold show up,get the boys pumped and groomed;they made being a nerd popular. Why can't we have a film like that for women?
 If you've seen the trailor,you've basically seen the film(along with the only funny jokes):Playboy hangeron Shelly gets kicked out of the mansion on her 27th birthday (""That's 59 in bunny years"").She finds herself in search of a job and a place to live for the first time in her life(this does raise the question about all of Hef's discards who haven't managed to get knocked up by an athlete or B list actor. Is there a bunny retirement fund?),and follows whispers of a party to the local college campus. There she is rejected by the snotty sorority,but finds her place with a group of misfits,most of whom are obviously hot chicks who just dull down their looks with glasses,bad hair,and no makeup:redhead hottie,pierced hottie(Kat Denning is so gorgeous that even when they try to make her unattractive she still blows away 90% of Playmates and models out there),pregnant girl(at least a few months ago she was popular),lumberjack like manly girl,dwarf girl,mute foreign chick,and brace wearing girl(which brings me to my next point:this film wins the Tori Spelling award for nepotism for having not one but two actors who were hired for no other reason but their famous parents:Colin,son of Tom,Hanks and Rumour,daughter of Bruce and Demi,Willis. They are average at best in terms of talent).The girls decide to accept Shelly as their housemum because they need pledges and feel that the only way to get them is to make boys interested in them(huh?I might be clueless,but why?Can't you sell your house as the smart,nonsnotty sorority to girls who,imagine this,came to college to study and not party?Are there no pre-med or advanced science majors looking to join a sorority?).Shelly of course gives the girls ""Glamourshots""makeovers,throws wild parties(how did they pay for the Aztec party,I wonder?That had to be at least a couple grand),and teaches the girls that by acting like braindead tarts their lives will be complete. Along the way Shelly falls for Colin ""not quite Tom""Hanks and learns that there is life beyond the Playboy lifestyle.
I know people who liked this film are going to get on me for taking it seriously,but I am sick to death of this genre. The scene where the girls are supposedly reclaiming themselves is very telling: ""Let's keep 60% Shelly"".What this says is that even when she is trying to be herself,she should only allow 40% of herself to come through to the outside world and 60% should be walking Barbie. And how about using girls with actual physical issues,not ones who only require 10 min. of makeup and hair?How about making an overweight girl or one with severe acne feel beautiful and sexy?That would take some guts to say that beauty comes in all forms, and let's face it,Hollywood doesn't have any. To say this film was moronic is to insult morons. I gave it one extra star for the Marilyn Monroe parody and the bunny age line(both of which are the funniest moments in the films and were in the trailor as was mentioned),but really,save yourself the waste of 90 min of your life and don't add any more money to Sandler's bloated wallet.

As it was, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is smart, funny, and a little deeper than its title might suggest. The blu-ray image was superb - as good as any I have seen. The premise of the film revolves around a Playboy bunny leaving the mansion and becoming the House Mother to a small group of apparently helpless and unpopular girls. If they don't get more pledges to their house soon, then their house is history. Enter the House Bunny, who gives them a makeover. So far, so predictable. However, this is where the film turns into something more interesting, as the house girls turn increasingly bitchy and our heroine is summoned back to the mansion to fulfil her dream of being a Playmate. Will she leave her house to follow her own dreams and, if she does, will they get the pledges they need? Watch it and find out. Oh, and my wife would never forgive me if I didn't mention the love story that is also integral to the film - the will she or won't she routine. The film left me with the intended feel good factor and a deeper appreciation of all things Playboy - Heff is a lucky guy - but this is a chick flick so I probably can't say that.",1268006400,,1304,4.240963855421687

I'm amazed how I watched till the end.

Anna Faris had a superb body in this movie.  She did a great job in playing her character.  She gave it a 100% in being as goofy as she could be.  I just wish the others like the director, the writer etc would have done well too in planning the story.  It's way overdone in past movies already.

3416584,3,B0018CNNV2,"3 of 5 stars for the comedy movie House Bunny. A cute story about a girl living at the Playboy Mansion in LA hoping for her big break in the magazine. Another girl tricks her into leaving the Mansion by sending a forged letter from Hef. Ultimately she finds her way to a college and a sorority of the down-and-out girls on campus. With alot of remakes, our Bunny turns the sorority into the cool-place-to-be. Of course a rival sorority attempts to compete. Eventually, Hef figures out what happened and invites her to return. Of course, her heart is now with the sorority.

So, why three stars for this comedy. Two stars for the movie and one extra star for the short, sexy outfits and hot girls. Oh, should mention that American Idol near-winner Katharine McPhee has a part in the movie as a very pregnant college girl. OK, it is easy on the brain, great for the eyes and is generally entertaining. Yes, watch it.",1258243200,,914,4.506024096385542
3416585,3,B0018CNNV2,"Though largely formulaic and predictable, ""The House Bunny"" remains a pretty enjoyable watch, thanks to the star (and co-executive producer) Anna Faris, best known for her turns in the ""Scary Movie"" franchise. Watch the film for her performance and maybe, just maybe you will not be disappointed.

In ""The House Bunny"" Anna Faris plays a 27-year-old Playboy bunny named Shelley Darlington, whose dream is to be a centerfold of the magazine. Actually, Shelley is an ex-Playboy bunny now because she got recently kicked out of Hugh Hefner's mansion on the day she turned 27 because, she thinks, that is like 59 in bunny years.

Shelley finds her new home in the sorority house Zeta Alpha Zeta. She also learns that Zeta will get the charter revoked unless they get 30 new pledges. As house mother Shelley first teaches the ""misfit"" girls there how to change their outward appearances. Well, as you expect, it works. Maybe not as smart as the heroine of ""Legally Blonde,"" Shelley remains confident, optimistic, and most importantly, likable.

It is Anna Faris and her undeniable talent as comedienne that makes ""The House Bunny"" barely watchable. Colin Hanks appears as Oliver, a good-natured student working as volunteer staff at senior citizen's home, but his role as Shelley's love interest is rather unmemorable. Two veterans Christopher McDonald and Beverly D'Angelo are wasted.

As I said before, watch ""The House Bunny"" for the leading lady's brilliant performance. I know she deserves a better script, and she will be terrific in much more ""serious"" movies, but that is another story.",1256947200,,1589,5.1

I thought this was a light hearted piece of fluff but nothing that exactly broke any records or was of too serious. It was a cute film, the acting was okay, and some of the transformations the girls went through were unexpected. The glorification of playboy manor as a Barbie doll house of fun was a bit disingenuous but might allow for positive discussions with young people about the impact of porn and beauty standards on the lives of women.",1253145600,,579,4.523809523809524
3416587,3,B0018CNNV2,"Anna Faris, who proved her incredible comedy talents as the star of the ""Scary Movie"" franchise, once again shines in the affable teen comedy, THE HOUSE BUNNY.

When sweet Playboy model Shelley Darlingson (Anna Faris) is booted out of the Mansion for committing the cardinal sin of turning twenty-seven (""that's 59 in Bunny Years!""), she must find a way to reinvent her life.  But what's a girl to do when she only has a killer rack and a sunny personality?  Of course...become the house mother to a struggling college sorority of misfit teen girls whose social skills could do with a bedazzling makeover!

It doesn't offer anything new to the teen comedy genre, but THE HOUSE BUNNY is likeable enough to please those who approach it in the right spirit.  Anna Faris is charming and delightful as Shelley, providing a sweet performance undeserving of the limited material.  Colin Hanks, Beverly d'Angelo, Christopher McDonald and the girls of Alpha Zeta (in particular Emma Stone, Kat Dennings, Rumer Willis and Kiely Williams) are all solid in their support.  Hugh Hefner's cameo with the real Playboy gals adds an extra touch of authenticity to Shelley's life at the Mansion.

3416588,3,B0018CNNV2,"Basically, this is a barely-updated re-telling of 'Revenge of the Nerds'. And if you liked that one, then you'll probably enjoy this movie as well. Same recycled characters as 20 years ago. The ""loser"" sorority sisters who are actually hotties-in-waiting? Check! The preppy/nasty/stuck-up competing sorority? Check! The clueless college administrators? Check!

Despite all this, I actually found myself very entertained. It had the same innocence and good nature as its predecessor. And a good part of the credit goes to Anna Farris as the homeless Playboy Bunny (kicked out of the Mansion for being too old at 27). She just throws herself so fully into the role, with no self-conciousness at all, that I totally bought into it. She was just too fresh and earnest to hate. And let's face it, it doesn't hurt that she looks so good in the little schoolgirl outfit.

I'm not so sure I need to own this on Blu-Ray or anything, it's probably not the kind of comedy you'd watch over and over again. But if you're looking for something that you can just sit back and relax with for 100 minutes, this would do just fine.",1251158400,,1113,4.761658031088083

The story was absurd, the acting was atrocious, and Anna Faris has absolutely zero appeal as an actress, character, or even as a sex symbol. The only thing the film makers got right was that Faris is the embodiment of what Playboy women have become in recent years; plastic from head to toe, and dumb as a bag o' hammers. In short, life is way too short to waist an hour and a half on crap like this. This makes ""Showgirls"" appear Oscar worthy.",1248048000,5,608,4.587155963302752

The main actress is attractive but it takes far more than that to make a move watchable (maybe guys would view it differently but my husband and son thought it was stupid as well).  The whole plot about why she got kicked out of the mansion in the first place was stupid.  She admits in the movie that people only started loving her when she grew up into a beautiful girl, as a child no one wanted her.  Her charges at the sorority were very cliche, not funny and not likable.  None of them had any talent with boys however one still managed to be pregnant.  The worst part of the movie had to be her habit of repeating names in a ""exorcist"" type voice to remember them.  I have no idea what the point behind that was and why it was considered funny.

As far as goofy comedies go, the writing was good.  The plot was cute.  The situations were were well-thought out and hilarious.

Shelley (Faris) I plays a wanna-be Playboy bunny who is cast from the Playboy Mansion after her 28th birthday.  To put a roof over her head she takes a group of social outcast sorority sisters in need of a house mother under her wing and shows them the ropes of presenting themselves and talking to men.  In turn the sisters teach her to an intellectual man (played by Colin Hanks).

Not to be overlooked is Emma Stone as the wallflower president of the sorority that Shelley becomes housemother to.  I was expecting a cliched girl nerd turn but Stone imbues Natalie with warmth and complexity.  It was also pretty cool that Hugh Hefner is on hand to take a self-deprecating portrayal of his image.

One day, Shelley received a letter asking her to leave the bunny house. Shelley was very sad, but was determined to find her own way in the big world.  She wandered and wondered, until she came across a big house full of ugly ducklings.

Now Shelley was a blonde bunny, and after thinking really hard for a few seconds, she decided to live with the ducklings and help them grow into foxes.  She really, really tried her best, and even though she could not stop all the clich&eacute;s from taking over the rest of the story, they lived relatively happily ever after.

The end.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Anna Faris plays the part of Shelley, a Playboy bunny evicted from the mansion after her 27th birthday party.
2. Hugh Hefner appears as himself
3. Shelley finds herself at the sad, sad sorority house of Zeta Alpha Zeta, inhabited by the likes of Katharine (Idol runner-up) McPhee, Emma (Superbad) Stone and Rumer (Why in the world did I have to inherit my father's chin?) Willis.
4. They need urgent help, and also to get new pledges to save their house
5. Help = Bunny + Makeovers + New wardrobes + Parties
6. Colin (Why aren't I more like my dad?) Hanks is a bland actor playing a bland role, and needs no further mention here.
7. Shelley has to make a big career decision

This is a comedy in the vein of a dumber ""Legally Blonde"" that's funny most (but not all of) of the time. Faris is a competent comedic lead actress (though she probably shouldn't venture very far from the comedy tree), and carries the movie, despite the fact that she's no Reese Witherspoon.

If you're in the mood for funny but formulaic, then this one's for you.

Shelley: Yes, I think I'll have the mahi-mahi, but can I get it with just one mahi?

Why does it seem that Sony has dropped the ball on this one? Sex and The City has TWO CDs of music, soooooo...... this masterpiece doesn't deserve one????

3416696,4,B0018CNNV2,"The House bunny is a very good movie. It's a funny movie but I thought it would be funnier. Anna Faris is hilarious as normal and it has a great cast. I wish their was a little more comedy in this movie so that is why I gave it 4 stars but overall I think it is a really good movie.

Short Summary: Anna Faris gets kicked out of the bunny mansion so with no place to go she goes to a soriety house full of nerds to become their den mother. Can Anna Faris turns the soriety around to make the nerds become popular? Watch the movie to find out.

This movie is full of mishaps and comedy. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good comedy or to anyone who is a fan of Anna Faris.",1233273600,2,683,3.8714285714285714

I highly recommend it! Enjoy.",1232928000,,373,4.753846153846154
3416698,5,B0018CNNV2,"This is a great funny movie, Anna Faris Is brilliant and hopefully this movie will make her a bigger star. Although this is a typical happy madison story line, Faris and a great supporting cast make this film a winner",1231977600,2,217,4.45
3416699,4,B0018CNNV2,"There are comedies that are subtle. There are comedies that are memorable. There are comedies that inspire. And then there are comedies that are just downright stupid and yet hilarious at the same time. THE HOUSE BUNNY falls into that category.

Now don't misunderstand, I don't mean this as an insult. Rather it is one of those movies that you watch and think ""this is goofy"" and at the same time find yourself rooting for the heroine and laughing all the way.

THE HOUSE BUNNY is a cross between LEGALLY BLONDE and REVENGE OF THE NERDS. Odd combination, eh? The story follows Shelley Darlingson (Anna Faris), one of Hugh Hefner's favorite bunnies at the mansion. Although not a girlfriend yet or even a centerfold, her dream, Shelley is well loved by all. With the exception of the new girl.

Shelley has her 27th birthday and the next morning wakes to find herself ejected from the mansion. It seems that 27 is like 59 in bunny years. Homeless, clueless and destitute, Shelley accidentally finds herself in a rare position. Coming across a college campus and top flight sorority house, she thinks it looks just like the mansion.

When she meets the house mothers gathered together, she is rebuffed by all but one who directs her to the Zeta house. The girls there are stereotypical nerds of all sorts. We have a smart girl, a rebellious goth girl, girl in body brace, shy girl, etc. The problem is that the girls are about to lose their charter and their house to the snob girls Shelley already met. But not if Shelley can turn things around.

Things get off to a rough start but it doesn't take long for Shelley to finally find a way to get the girls to change. Their appearance is the first step and they change from slob like nerds into model type hotties. As each one has to confront their own personal problems, Shelley in her own weird way helps them.

Problems rise when the girls begin to find the shoe on the other foot. Having become popular, they begin to look down on the possible pledges they need to save the house.  A disagreement with Shelley leaves her on the street once more, but fortunately the truth about her banning from the mansion is found out and she returns but still misses the girls.

A dirty deal by the head of the snob sorority leaves them with no new pledges, a requirement to stay open. The only person who can help them turn things around is Shelley. Will she do it? Of course she will!

Through all of this we have a secondary story of Shelley becoming attracted to a young man on campus (Colin Hanks). This is her first attempt at true love and she blows it. Using the seductive tricks she's learned at the mansion doesn't work. Trying to act smart doesn't work. She doesn't seem to understand that just being herself might be the best way to land Hanks.

The movie works on the premise that all college comedy movies seem to. Get rude, crude and have fun. It makes you wonder where anyone finds the chance to study! Guys are Neanderthals seeing only the surface of a girl and yet seem to attract them all the same. Girls are forced to be superficial to win the guy but their inner beauty shows in the end.

Its funny to watch the semi-crude jokes (but mostly tame in comparison to earlier college films) played out through female leads instead of the usual males. And each actress here (Emma Stone, Kat Dennings, Rumour Willis, Kielley Williams, Katharine McPhee, Dana Goodman, Kimberley Makkouk) does a great job of showing the change from slob to vixen only to learn the truth of beauty.

The movie not only turns a twist on the college sorority/fraternity film, it offers more laughs than most. Sure it's a no brainer but that doesn't matter. It's all fun. And in that fun we find plenty of laughs. Anna Faris shows that she has what it takes to carry a film as a comedic actress. Not only that, the dorky looking girl from the SCARY MOVIE films has blossomed into a real beauty. Looks and talent, something Faris has plenty of and something that is seen in this film that is guaranteed to make you laugh.",1231804800,,4049,4.516393442622951
3416700,5,B0018CNNV2,"My friend and I saw this in theaters and I was hoping they didn't show all the funny parts in the trailer. And they didn't! It was so funny! Happy Madison did it again! Anna Faris is perfect for the part of Shelley. Carrie Mae was my favorite character though. Non stop laughs! It's not just a girlie movie either. When I got in the mail, my husband watched it with me and he loves it too!",1231718400,,389,4.064935064935065
3416701,5,B0018CNNV2,I would give this movie 100 stars.  It's funny and refreshing.  A movie to be watched over and over.,1231200000,2,100,4.2105263157894735
3416702,4,B0018CNNV2,"Well, I'm embarrassed to admit that I really enjoyed this silly movie.  I hadn't intended to see it, but got pushed into watching it with my family.  And I liked it better than they did!  It was actually very sweet.

The plot, of course, is a cliche.  Nerdy sorority is made cool by an ex-bunny.  Not original.  But it isn't meant to be.  This whole thing is just a wonderful frame for the comedic talents of the people involved.  We particularly enjoyed the scene where Shelley tries to act like Marilyn Monroe over the steam vent, and gets her knees badly steamed.  That is just so silly that you have to laugh.

Also, at my house, we just find it so strange that the series ""the girls next door,"" whose performers are in this film (the Faris role, Shelley, is supposed to be living at the Playboy Mansion as the movie opens), is one of the sweetest shows on TV.  We expected trash, and were confounded by pleasant people that we genuinely like.  So that predisposed us to like this film, too.  There is a certain innocence to the whole thing.

So, I find myself in the position of recommending this film to anyone who enjoys silly comedy.",1230681600,10,1141,4.418269230769231
3416703,2,B0018CNNV2,"look I like bad movies,i.e. The Marine.  I picked up this movie with the hopes it would be a guilty plesure type of bad.  I was disappointed.  First this rips off SNYDEY WHITE and REVENGE OF THE NERDS in plot.  It tries to have a lesson or moral to the story and it does.  However,the script is not smooth.  Things seem to move in a jerky manner.  The movie never really decides on what it wants to be, either raunchy or sweet.  The lead actress is quite good, but she is let down by the script.  the other girls in Zeta house are not all developed and are short changed in screen time,i.e. the short girl.  The villians aren't that bad and the big climax at the meeting is not exciting.  The love relationship between the bunny and the man is not... well no chemistry at all.  This movie sounds cute when you read the back cover of the DVD case but it never lives up to hope of a great ""bad movie.""  I know this sounds rather disjoined but that is the way the movie is.",1230681600,3,970,4.122994652406417
3416734,5,B0018CNNV2,"I think that this is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen if not the funniest. I don't think anyone would have ever thought of Anna Farris as a playboy bunny but she played the part very well (and looked very good I might add). This is definitely classic Anna if you liked her other films. She is a comedic genius. This is one movie that you can watch over and over and never get tired of it. It is just as funny over and over again. This is Anna's project since she came up with the story, produced, and starred in it. I cannot wait to see more from her.",1230508800,,567,3.982456140350877
3416735,3,B0018CNNV2,"What happens when you turn twenty-seven and you're a Playboy Bunny?  Hef kicks you out of his mansion.  I know, harsh, but those are the bitter realities of taking your clothes off for a living.  Poor misinformed Shelly Darlingson learns the hard way what aging will get you when she is thrown from the mansion and left homeless at the beginning of `The House Bunny'.  She goes from living it up to living in her car, but you can't keep a good girl down.  Through a series of preposterous events Shelly finds herself the house mother of a fraternity about to lose its house thanks to a lack of support and members.  What these misfits need is a good makeover, and Shelly is just the right person for the job.

Hehe, like seriously, this movie is not good, but it's funny if you're into this kind of humor, and it will serve as a decent escape from the realities of everyday life.

The film is beyond ridiculous, and it is predictable beyond belief, but it is fun and sometimes that is all that matters.  Anna Faris is hysterical to me.  I truly adore her.  She is the only reason to watch any of the `Scary Movie' sequels, and she continues to hone her comedic timing in fare like `Just Friends' and smarter films like `Lost in Translation'.  This is not her smartest work, but it is one of her most effective performances.  She finds the right balance between Shelley's ditzyness and her earnestness.  The rest of the cast do a fine job of keeping up, especially Kat Dennings and Emma Stone (ugh, love her).

This is your typical story of ugly unpopular girls get prettified and become popular all to the snobby popular girls disproval and wind up saving face and becoming the girls they always wanted to be.  It's `Sorority Girls' only funnier and less offensive.

Plus, it has the girl's next-door in it!

So, here's my official take.  It's a decent movie that delivers the laughs.  Sure, some of the humor is pretty lowbrow and you may have to enjoy making fun of others abnormalities to enjoy some of the humor, but if you turn off your brain and soak in the film then you will find yourself enjoying just about every minute.  Anna Farris is a laugh riot and deserves to be recognized for that.  Give this girl more work, maybe something smarter, and watch her soak it all up.  She has talent enough to become a huge comedic actress.",1230508800,,2338,4.475177304964539
3416736,4,B0018CNNV2,"It was a cute film.
I figured that when you hear the name and find out about it  being about a playboy bunny you think 'T&A' and nudeity but thankfully it wasnt.
Some scenes were funny and some weren't even when they were intended to be funny *Guy+cat+nipples= me yawn*
I found it cute how a bunch of frompy girls are able to realize the true beauty of themselves. Plus they had tones of cute guys*eyecandy.*
Its a okay film and I find few happy gilmore movies soso and some that just kick the bucket.

Some of the acting was a little akward. But it was still funny...with major help from Anna Faris and Kat Dennings. It gets to be a little slow closer to the end though. More comedians should aspire to be as great and do as good as Anna Faris does. (But not Chelsea Handler! She's awesome!) It has a very ""fluffy"" feel to it.

3416738,3,B0018CNNV2,"Ever notice that when you're in the mood for a good college underdog fraternity movie like Animal House or Revenge Of The Nerds that your wife or girlfriend quickly leaves the room? Now there's the female equivalent with a dab of good old-fashion male appeal in mainstay Playboy Magazine called The House Bunny.

Scary Movie's Anna Faris (looking amazingly fit and believable) plays Shelley, a past Playboy model who dreams of one day making centerfold. She's spent most of her adult life living at the Playboy Mansion, but after her 27th birthday party there, she receives a note from Hef (actually appearing in the film) saying it's time to hit the bricks and move out (don't worry, Hef's not that bad of a guy and I don't want to give it all away...). Eventually after unsuccessfully trying to find a new place to call home, she stumbles upon a sorority house filled with the most oddball and socially challenged girls this side of Venus. So she moves on in to help the girls reach their much needed 30 pledges by becoming their house mother and personal beautifier & let the girl-power begin!

Face it, if it wasn't for the Playboy aspect buried in this film, guys might as well be watching Steel Magnolias:The Teenage Years, but actually there's a couple of good laughs here and there for both sexes. Faris does her wacky blonde bit by the book, but the supporting cast is interesting too. Head girl Emma Stone does an amazing impersonation of one-time Superbad co-star Jonah Hill all throughout her ""geeky"" period, and the child of Bruce and Demi, Rumer, follows through with her overdue back-brace and homage to Forrest Gump. And don't get me started on main love interest Colin Hanks, who to me is becoming his Dad Tom more and more with each passing year (I'd say he's currently in ""Money Pit"" mode). Add in a couple of other odd-ball girls that give you the remembrance of classic characters like Booger, Meat, and Stork and you have all the makings of a passable hi-jink College movie for the Pussycat-Doll generation.

While the behind-the-scenes, deleted footage, and music videos merit a decent amount of extras, I can't suggest buying this one blindly before a good rental. Maybe a commentary with all the girls together might have been the icing on the cake, but for now this somewhat typical Revenge Of The Grrrls flix will help pass a night or two while you convince your girlfriend that you respect Playboy Bunnies' minds as well as their bodies. Yeah, right.

Pros:
*Anna Faris' backside. Wow, that wasn't a stand-in, she's really
that fine. DAMN, TURN AROUND!!!
*Now your girlfriend has something to watch while you see
Animal House for the one-hundredth time.
*A couple of these odd-ball female secondary characters really take ""outcast"" to a whole new meaning.

Cons:
*Could have been alot more raunchy and Playboy seems like Maxim here.
*Rumer Willis. I really hate to say this, but Demi's eyes and Bruce's chin does not make the greatest of combinations.
*You know how this is gonna turn out five seconds into it.
Sorry, I meant three seconds....

3416739,3,B0018CNNV2,"When a playboy bunny named Shelley (Anna Faris) gets kicked out of the Playboy mansion, she has nowhere to go, until she meets the sorority girls from Zeta Alpha Zeta.  These girls are classified as the losers on campus, the social misfits led by Natalie (Emma Stone) and are on the verge of losing their house due to a lack of pledges.  Shelley then assumes the role of house mother and mentors the misfit chicks and vows to help them keep their house.

""The House Bunny"" is in a ways a bit like ""Van Wilder"", but a female version.  The plot structures are similar; simply replace Van trying to graduate college with a sorority trying to keep their house, and switch Tara Reid with Colin Hanks to play the love interest for the main character.  ""Bunny"" is chock full of bimbo ideology, strange metaphors, and Shelley's odd method of remembering names, which sounds like Regan from ""The Exorcist"" when under demonic possession.

Despite the silliness of ""The House Bunny,"" the movie ends with a serious undertone; stop pretending and be yourself.  Oddly enough this comes from a main character who switches from being an utter ditz to being very intelligent, and doesn't seem to understand how to be herself.  However, Faris' portrayal of said character was dead on, and she was pretty funny.  All in all, ""The House Bunny"" is worthy of a few pics in Playboy, but it's not good enough for the centerfold.  In other words, got rent it.",1229644800,,1434,4.677290836653387

3416741,4,B0018CNNV2,"Anna Faris is one of the popular comedic actresses with her roles in ""Scary Movie"" films but also showed us how versatile of an actress that she is through roles in films such as ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"".

But this time, Faris has dual roles as executive producer and actress for ""THE HOUSE BUNNY"", a comedy film written by the creators of ""Legally Blonde"" and produced by Happy Madison Productions.  And with that being said, if you are a fan of Happy Madison style of films such as ""50 First Dates"", ""Deuce Bigalow"" or more recently with films such as ""Bedtime Stories"", you know that you're getting a fun film that will generate a lot of laughs.  But also films that are not meant to be taken seriously.  Just sit back and enjoy.

""THE HOUSE BUNNY"" features Shelley (Anna Faris), a young orphan who becomes a beautiful model for Playboy and lives in the Playboy mansion.  Her dream is to become a Playmate and Miss November.  But after celebrating an extravagant 27th birthday at the Playboy mansion highlighted by cameos by professional athletes such as Shaquille O'Neal and Matt Leinart, Shelley receives a letter that she must vacate the Playboy mansion.

Shelley becomes homeless and has some rough luck until she overhears a sorority talking about fashion and she follows them to their home.  Not knowing what a sorority house is, she meets the house mothers who pretty much tells her to get lost while one feels sorry for her and tells her to visit another sorority, Zeta Alpha Zeta.

The Zeta Alpha Zeta sorority are a few women who are somewhat nerds, outcasts and are in danger of losing their house because they don't have 30 members.  Fortunately for them, Shelley takes up a job to become their house mother and using her sexy body brings the attention to the sorority and hopefully help them get the 30 members that they need but also helping the women discover their inner beauty and to hopefully give them the courage to get a makeover and also meet guys.

Anna Faris really makes this film work.  Faris really worked out for the role to make Shelley's part work.  Having to wear short shorts and showing off her toned abs and body, it's definitely not a part that I would have imagined her playing but she executes her role convincingly.

Shelley is much more ditsier than Witherspoone's ""Legally Blonde"" character and because she is quite naive and only exposed to what goes on at the Playboy Mansion, she has an interesting way of viewing life and again, Faris does a great bringing life into her character.

Joining Farris are the Zeta Alpha Zeta sorority girls:

Natalie (played by ""Superbad"" actress Emma Stone), the leader of Zeta Alpha Zeta who is pretty much the brainiac.

Mona (played by the ""40-Year Old Virgin"" and ""Nick and Norah's Infinity Playlist"" Kat Denning), the punk girl who is anti-popular and has piercings all over her face.

Harmony (played by ""American Idol"" finalist Katharine McPhee), the pregnant sorority member.

Joanne (played by ""From Within"" actress Rumer Willis), the sorority member who wears a body brace.

Lilly (played by Cheetah Girls member Kiely Williams), the sorority member who is afraid to talk to people.

Carrie Mae (played by Deuce Bigalow: The European Gigalow"" actress Dana Goodman), as a scary sorority member who walks with a hunchback.

Tanya (played by Kimberly Makkouk), as the very small member of the group.

And also starring Colin Hanks as Oliver, a normal guy who works at a convalescent home. Shelley happens to be attracted to him but her Playboy way of attracting men by flaunting her body, doesn't seem to work on him, thus with the help of the Zeta Alpha Zeta girls, they teach her how to be smart.

The film also features a pretty strong soundtrack as a lot of the songs are well-known such as ""When I Grow Up"" by the Pussycat Dolls and ""Shut Up and Let Me Go"" by the Ting Tings.

VIDEO:

The video is featured in 1080p high definition and aspect ratio is 2:40:1.  Picture quality was quite vibrant during the outdoor scenes and during dark scenes, I really don't recall seeing much noise during the blacks.

AUDIO:

The film is featured in TrueHD 5.1.  Although the film is primarily a dialogue film, where the film really gets pumped up audio-wise is during the moments that feature a lot of music.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The Blu-ray edition of ""The House Bunny"" definitely has a good number of featurettes included.

  * House Bunny Style: Make-up/hair/wardrobe documentary on making over the Zeta girls into ""Bunnies""
  * The Girls of Zeta: A look into the actresses who make up the sorority girls of Zeta and how they bonded on-set
  * Calendar Girls: A fun look into the photo shoot for the calendar
  * Anna Faris: House Mom: A look at Anna Faris and her character of ""Shelley"", her infectious smile, fun personality and interactions with others
  * Colin Hanks: Mr. Nice Guy
  * From Song to Set: Katherine McPhee: A look at the on-set experiences of first-time actress Katharine McPhee
  * From Tour Bus to Trailer: Tyson Ritter: A look at the on-set experiences of first-time actor Tyson Ritter
  * Look Who Dropped By: Checkout the stars who showed up on-set!
  * The Girls Upstairs: Behind the scenes with the real ""Girls Next Door""
  * Zetas Transformed
  * Getting Ready for a Party
  * House Bunny Memories
  * I Know What Boys Like Music Video by Katharine McPhee
  * INTRODUCTION TO ""I KNOW WHAT BOYS LIKE""
  * Deleted Scenes

For me, the featurette with Anna Faris was interesting to watch.  Especially to get her take on having to do the dual roles as an executive producer and being the lead actress.  Also, learning how she had to really workout for the role and her thoughts of wearing the skimpy outfits.  Really good insight into the actual film.

Also, it was great to see the camaraderie of the ladies in the film and how much fun they had shooting the film.  There literally are a good number of featurettes that last around five minutes or more on this Blu-ray.

In ""Looked Who Dropped By"", you get to see the number of talent who had cameos in the film from Shaq, Matt Leinart, former ESPN analyst Sean Sallisbury, sportscaster Dan Patrick and many more.  ""The Girls Upstairs"" features Hugh Heffner and the three Playmates from ""Girls Next Door"" on set.

As for the deleted scenes, no commentary but there were quite a number of deleted scenes which I agree with the director for cutting out those scenes.

I wish there was a commentary segment featuring Faris but unfortunately there wasn't one.  But overall, you do get a good number of special features on the Blu-ray disc and it is BD-Live enabled.

Typically, when I watch a ""Happy Madison"" produced film, I expect to watch a comedy and just sit back and see how crazy and at times, how moronic some films can be.  But with ""THE HOUSE BUNNY"", I have to admit that I was amazed to see Anna Faris in this role and how she brought this character to life.

Personally, I don't think I can picture any actress making this role happen and so I was very pleased with her performance.  As for the overall film, I would call it ""Legally Blonde"" meets ""The Revenge of the Nerds"" and to see how the women literally transform themselves to the women no one wants to be around, to the women than the frat boys want to party with.

But with that being said, that scenario can be seen quite negatively to people who do not believe a woman should have to go through a makeover, wear slinky outfits to make things happen for them in college.

For me, many Happy Gilmore produced films are never meant to be taken seriously and for those who approach these comedy films with a lot of seriousness, are probably going to get disappointed.  You need to really sit back and just enjoy how far the characters can make you laugh or make you feel embarrassed.  It's all fun!

Again, Anna Faris does a great job on this film and really demonstrating her versatility as an actress.  Without her, I really don't think this film could have worked.  She brought life into the character of Shelley and watching the featurette, she definitely made it fun for the other actresses and they fed off that enthusiasm,  The chemistry with Faris and the other actresses worked quite well.

Overall, ""THE HOUSE BUNNY"" is a fun and enjoyable comedy that is sure to make you laugh and also looks great on Blu-ray.",1229126400,14,8360,4.647098976109215
3416742,5,B0018CNNV2,"Anna Faris proves herself to be the ""Marilyn Monroe"" of this generation in a cute, heart-warming comedy about a Playboy bunny, who is ejected from Hugh Hefner's mansion the day after she turns twenty-seven, because she's too old.  Actually, this wasn't Hef's doing, however we don't learn that until halfway through the picture.

Anna is a sweet girl, but definitely not the brightest bulb in the chandelier.  Her only goal in life is to become a Playboy centerfold.

On the first day on her own, she finds herself homeless and, because of a misunderstanding, spends a night in jail.

Her life changes when she stumbles onto UCLA's sorority row and becomes the house mother of the sorriest sorority on the block.  She teaches the girls how to attract guys, and they teach her how to win a guy...hopefully, for keeps.
