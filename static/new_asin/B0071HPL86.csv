5047390,2,B0071HPL86,"It seems that horror films today have picked the top boogey man of the heap. With TWILIGHT we've decided not to fear vampires for a while and with the box office failure of THE WOLF MAN we've decided to use the stand by creature we love to fear: the zombie. So many zombie movies are out there as well as the successful book THE ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE making the best seller list that it only seems natural that film makers would make this the creature de jour of our time. Far too much so.

THE TERROR EXPERIMENT may not use our typical zombie but that's how things are going at present. We use variations of the zombie rather than stick with the stand by regular living dead. In this film a secret lab has a problem when a formula being worked on is released throughout the building. Except that it doesn't hit all floors. But the ones it does find its way to infects those working there and turns them into mind blowing violent zombies.

Okay maybe not quite zombies like we're used to. Remember I said they'd changed a little? These zombies are prone to violence and move as fast as humans do. It still takes a head shot to put them down and wounds just tend to piss them off. Naturally there are a few survivors and their goal is to get out. One survivor's daughter was in day care below so he's concerned about her and rather than just find an escape looks for her as well. The rest are the stereotypical mish mash.

While all of this is going on the building has been put into quarantine.  The fire chief is doing his best to control the situation until the CDC arrives to take over. When they do, it becomes a question of trying to help the survivors or simply destroy the building with all left inside to prevent the contagion spreading.

This sounds like a decent idea for a movie and on the whole it's not bad. But it lacks something, that extra oomph that would make it either a more horrifying movie or a more sympathetic one. The acting is basic and no one, including the star names attached over exceeds the expectations of a B movie. It could be that the story is becoming par for the course or it could just be that the film lacks that spark that makes it move to over the top status. As it is this DVD is just the usual without any real reason to make it that one you must see. If, however, the store shelves are bare or the Redbox is low, it might make a decent film to watch.",1336953600,,2394,4.241228070175438
5047391,3,B0071HPL86,"This is a bit cheesy. I guess they didn't have much for a budget maybe? It's like a bunch of bad movies combined together. anyways you could say its a rip off 28 days/weeks, a bit like quarantine without the camera sickness, and maybe some others that I can't think of. I'd recommend you skip it unless your that bored and curious.",1336176000,3,331,4.354838709677419
5047392,4,B0071HPL86,"I've decided to not attack all the prior reviews, those are their opinions, therefore, here's mine.
From the synopsis, I could tell it'd be yet another independent zombie flick in the veins of 28 Days/Weeks Later (albeit in a confined space), so I knew not to expect perfection. Still, for what I watched, it really wasn't that bad.
Story was simple, a terrorist with an extremist patriot complex believes he sees political hypocrisy in his own nation and wishes to see something like a ""reset"" (as I'd call it) by exposing deadly secrets in a government building. Those secrets being a deadly virus that changes the mindset of a person, making them highly paranoid and overtly aggressive. Yes, it's basically a total rip-off of 28D/WL, but it didn't stop me from enjoying. In fact, before all the action really starts, you get to see all the little things in normal lives, including that of a divorced couple (along with a small touch of humor before total insanity breaks loose), play out.
There weren't that many jump moments, but what there was was pretty decent since it went very well with the story. Some pretty crazy death scenes, a few twists here and there, and one particular crazed zombie that seems like a dimwit rip-off of a zombie from Land of the Dead (remember the one that figured out how to use a machine gun? Watch this and you'll see which one's the rip-off).
Acting, like that of any low-budget indie, isn't perfect by any standard, but it's still better than some I've seen (2012: Doomsday always comes to mind as the worst indie film I've ever seen in ever single aspect), so there's a plus. Some people, sadly, do die off (in which I mean I wish they hadn't, but that wouldn't be good for the death quota in making a film like this, would it?), but nonetheless, the main character, who's been in search of one particular person in a quarantined building, does have reason, in the end, to hope. And the reason for that hope may end up giving bad nostalgia for those in Oklahoma City, 'nuff said.
All in all, especially for an obviously low-budgeted indie zombie film, I pretty well enjoyed this. Nowhere near perfect, but I could at least handle it for what it was worth.",1335398400,7,2195,4.616368286445013
5047393,1,B0071HPL86,"The zombie fad has gained some serious leg room in our culture these days, and not quite content leaving it be, B-list Hollywood has to get their dirty fingers in the mix and pump out generic, relatively uninspired `zombie'-like cash in flicks. I won't miss the cool of the zombie fad once John Q tires of it and deems it clich because I ACTUALLY LIKE zombie films, and not these cookie cutter wannabes but the Romero classics, even the Return of the Living Dead series are worthy staples in the genre that I grew up with. But, until that day I'll keep being herded to watch pale amateurs that I know will be of poor quality, poor intellectual design, and provide me with nothing I haven't seen before. The Terror Experiment is just the punishment I needed.

I picked this one up (Zombie appreciation aside) while browsing Blockbuster because I saw not 1, not 2, not 3 nor 4, but 5 solid horror movie actors or has been faces I've enjoyed all my life: Judd Nelson, C. Thomas Howell, Robert Carradine, Lochlyn Munro, and Jason London. I figured that with such positive, capable players there must be some redeeming qualities to the film? And this is where we have the constant tone of The Terror Experiment. You have capable and very talented actors working with the most mundane dialogue you could muster. And there's only such you can do to polish a turd before you realize it's crap and Turtle Wax. C. Thomas Howell gives a great performance and makes the worst, genre standard dialogue more than it is. Robert Carradine is a breeze, he plays it smooth and cool. Very professional. Judd Nelson is silent, and condescending when he speaks, and anyone who has seen The Breakfast Club knows he can nail that with ease. It's so sad seeing the actors truly put effort into something that simply doesn't deserve it.

The folly of poor writing aside, what really nags is the ever poor production. Saying it is a B movie may be over congratulating. When guns fire they don't really fire. Instead we are treated to a close up of the gun and overdubbed sounds effects likely taken from a toy machine gun I had as a kid. The handful of times they do show a gun discharge it is clearly computerized muzzle flashes.

The `zombies' (which aren't really zombies but think 28 Days Later) are really only a minor part of the story, they pose no real threat in hindsight and they are there about 12 minutes into the film and by the end of the first hour we've forgotten about them. And there are no herds of the undead swarming our heroes but 1 lone `zombie' who causes infinite distress to our characters; why bother?

The Terror Experiment is more accurately a redundancy experiment. Nothing shocking happens, it is certainly not scary, the filler scenes of Government officials bickering about jurisdiction and conspiracy cover ups is insulting to anyone who graduated High School, but hey, at the very least the cover most certainly rocks. My advice? Nothing to see here, folks.",1335225600,3,2966,4.643809523809524
5047394,3,B0071HPL86,"It's hard to take any zombie movies seriously these days besides ones made by George Romero or featuring the words ""28 Days"" in the title. There are at least two or three new ones coming out every month either straight to DVD or in limited theatrical runs. Honestly, I wouldn't watch any of them if they weren't sent to me for review.

That's why I'm thankful that sometimes I'm made to watch movies I wouldn't necessarily give a chance. That's how I felt about ""The Terror Experiment"" when the end credits rolled.

""The Terror Experiment"" isn't anything new. It's not really trying to break any new ground that I can tell. It's merely providing more entertainment for fans of movies like ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""28 Days Later,"" and ""The Crazies.""
The combination of Jason London (""Dazed and Confused""), Judd Nelson (""The Breakfast Club""), C. Thomas Howell (""The Outsiders""), and Robert Carradine (""Revenge of the Nerds"") in the cast is almost like an attempt at stunt-casting a reunion of 1980s/1990s teen stars. It just adds to the fun atmosphere this film provides. The only downside for consumers is the lack of bonus material on the Blu-ray version.",1334707200,3,1159,4.848484848484849

This movie had a passable list of talented-enough B-list actors, including Judd Nelson, who I happen to think is underrated.  There is no excuse for not putting one iota of care, thought, or originality into the script or directing, or being satisfied with this low level of execution from everyone involved.  The people who worked on this movie were privileged to be WORKING ON A MOVIE...something a lot of people wish they could do.  People with far fewer resources have made much better films.  This thing is an insult.  This is not a review--it's a consumer report.  Avoid like the plague.

5047396,1,B0071HPL86,"The storyline is about a terrorist (patriot from his point of view) who wants to make a statement by releasing the toxin that a research lab is working on thus turning it's effects upon the people associated with it. The toxin makes people a bit more aggressive than usual resulting in a lot of angry trapped workers killing one another. Some escape to the top floors and await rescue but of course the government has other plans - just blow up the building. Usual allusions to Area 51 and psychotropic drugs and, of course, only a few unaffected survive.

What are you paying for in watching this movie? The usual shaky hand held camera; dumb dialogue from Hollywood script writers that try to sound like someone that they have no clue about; a setting of a few hallways, rooms and stairwells all in one building; annoying sound effects (humans growling in this case); cheap props like guns that sound like toys with really cheap CGI gunfire flashes added in post editing; a noncreative copying of a storyline that's been done so often you might as well watch just the first and last minutes and be assured you missed nothing.",1334188800,7,1127,4.663316582914573

I can't even say that the virus in this movie resembles that of 28 days later, because it is EXACTLY the same thing. It makes you extremely angry. Sadly, they can't pull it off nearly as well. I was bored throughout this whole film and the acting was dull and flat. Its movies like this that make me think any idiot can make a movie these days.  Save your money on this and just watch 28 weeks later again. It was way better than the first one, and it was actually scary.",1334188800,5,562,4.109090909090909

After a disgruntled veteran unleashes a virus in an office building in order to expose a government secret things don't go as planned. A group of uninfected survivors try to escape the quarantined building and get to safety before it's too late. I had no idea what to expect from this movie at all. I have been watching almost everything before watching the preview to help me have a clean slate when I start. I saw the cast and thought this may be OK. I wish I would have seen the preview first. I am not sure if they were going for a serious movie or a over-the-top cheesy comedy movie. I hope to God it was the latter because if they tried to make this a serious movie they failed. If they went for a comedy type movie they did a little better but this is a few steps above the Sci-Fy channel movies (because of the cast). I really thought this was going to be a zombie movie but it turned out to be a comedy (?) version of ""Quarantine"". Overall, not my kind of movie but some people will like it. I give it a C-.",1332288000,5,1066,4.1298076923076925
5047400,2,B0071HPL86,"Several of America's federal buildings have fallen under attack by embittered war veterans, who unleash a deadly toxin that turns normal people into psychotic killers. THE TERROR EXPERIMENT is a muddles mess of a film that can never decide if it wants to be a disaster movie or a zombie shocker. It throws out references to everything from Area 51 to the attacks on 9/11 to the military's experimental drug use in Vietnam in a vain attempt at social significance that is undermined by the overall unintelligence of the script. The extra money that was used to sign Jason London and C. Thomas Howell would have been better spent coming up with a more inventive plot, but instead we are left with a typically bland revision of George Romero's THE CRAZIES as set in a federal office building. The real test becomes trying to make it to the end of this dreadful experiment.

5047402,2,B0071HPL86,"Terror Experiment is what you would expect for most low-budget Redbox thrillers. Once I realized that the featured actors were C. Thomas Howell, Judd Nelson, and Robert Carradine (Revenge of the Nerds), I knew this would be a typical B-Movie, but still decided to give it a shot.

The problem with Terror Experiment is that there's really nothing memorable about it. Most of the cast offer ""I'm just here for the check"" performances. The writing isn't anything special, and the story isn't terribly original. For the most part, it's a ripoff of ""28 Days Later"" with hints of ""Jacob's Ladder"" thrown in.

There are also plenty of plot holes. The biggest of which is that there's a building jam-packed with federal employees on Christmas Eve. Several times during the start of the movie, it's revealed that the date is December 24th. Apparently, not even the guy who carts mail around the office gets the day off.

The film was shot well, and the color correction was fine. It looks better than most straight-to-DVD movies, but unoriginal story lines and generic acting performances make it obvious why Terror Experiment was never in theaters. As a diehard fan of low-budget horror flicks and thrillers, I actually don't regret renting this movie.
