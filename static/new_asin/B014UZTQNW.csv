I don't know how I came across this series, but I don't regret finding it.  I has English subtitles so if you don't have a machine that plays these, beware.  This series is so fascinating.  Martin is very somber but an excellent actor and detective.  At times I wanted to cry for ""poor Marin"", but after Volume 1 and 2, of course I ordered volume 3.  I'll probably collect all of them the are so good.  Some surprises throughout the whole series.  You're gonna love Beck.",1506038400,,590,4.37962962962963
