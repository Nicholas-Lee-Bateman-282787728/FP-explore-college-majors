512831,5,630279756X,"FIVE STARS.  One of my favorite Horror/SciFi movies. A sensational low budget movie that begins with a farming problem facing an indian reservation that quickly becomes the basis for a great, unpretentious horror movie, without all of the CGI and 'wire-kung fu' nonsense that predominates most SciFi. It stays on target with no diversions. The plot really hangs together well and the story is similar to ""Alien"" where the characters are so excellently drawn by the script and the actors, that the dangerous circumstances really mean something to the audience when the characters are threatened. With terrific performances by Nick Mancuso as Deputy Youngman Duran, Kathryn Harrold as the love interest, Strother Martin in a hoot of a role, Stephen Macht, portraying Walker Chee, as good as he's ever been, and David Warner in a totally arresting and surprising role, director Arthur Hiller gets a ton of mileage from the cast. When nature, science, love, greed, and Native American folklore and religion collide things really get out of hand fast, with Duran in the middle of things. George Clutesi deserves special mention for his portrayal of Abner, a central character who is Mancuso's native American spiritual guide. The sound track has mesmerized me since 1979 when the movie came out: totally nailed by Henry Mancini (and sitting on my 'best of the best' cassette tape). The opening sequence is beautifully photographed especially if you love the desert southwest as I do.

If you haven't read the other reviews yet, stop now and see the movie. Hopefully, you haven't read the spoilers. Let the movie take you on the journey. I think you'll enjoy it, if horror and SciFi are your main interest. Pop some popcorn, grab some sodas and enjoy this delightful romp!!  I watch the tape often and have ordered the DVD for a permanent keeper. Five Stars.",1133136000,9,1852,4.9870550161812295
512832,3,630279756X,"The meaning of the title of this 1979 film becomes clear when we learn that an Indian reservation in New Mexico has been invaded by vampire bats.  This situation is complicated by the fact that, in the best tradition of rampant stereotypes, there is oil underneath the tribe's sacred burial grounds and a soulless oil company is out to get it no matter what.  The oil is actually in a cave, which is how we work the bats into the story, because companies drilling for oil rarely hit bats.  Standing in the way of progress, besides all those bat puppets, is Youngman Duran (Nick Mancuso), a reservation cop, who is basically the only person in the film with both brains and ethics.  David Warner is Phillip Payne, the bat expert who shows up to provide the characters and the audience with any and all necessary exposition until the climax, when he comes up with a plan for saving the day because these might be vampire bats, but instead of sucking blood they are spreading Bubonic plague.
Based on the novel by Martin Cruz Smith, the script by Steve Shagan and Bud Shrake is fairly faithful to the original story and wants to evince political consciousness, but resorts to stand Hollywood conceptions about what life is like on the reservation, which is most painful when it portrays the debate between those who want to preserve tradition and those who want to build modern things like hospitals.  I remember when ""Nightwing"" was being filmed in New Mexico, mostly up around Laguna Pueblo and the Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe.  Flavio Martinez, a kid I went to high school with, and who played the part in a forgettable Disney movie that has never been released on video, had a bit part in this film as Isla Laloma.  Directed by Arthur Hiller, ""Nightwing"" also features Kathryn Harrold as the pretty woman who has to be rescued from the bats, Staphen Macht as the Indian who argues for progress, and Strother Martin as a crazy old coot.  However, overall the locations are a lot better than the acting or the special effects.
One of the ways ""Nightwing"" harkens back to the good old days of horror movies, besides the rubber bats, is the way they promoted this film.  Consider all the taglines this film had: ""In the dead of night they come - Swift - Silent - Savage,"" ""The day belongs to man.  The night is theirs,"" and ""What do you fear most - the dark - or something that waits in the dark,"" all have this inherent ambiguity that could be referring to the Indians as well as the bats.  But then ""The bats of hell let loose upon the earth"" pretty much gives the game away.  But it always a bad sign when the taglines are better than the movie.  I was going to say that somebody somebody was going to use computers to make a really good horde of monster bats movie, but Louis Morneau tried to do that in the 1999 film ""Bats"" and it is on the AFI's list of ""Bottom 100"" movies.  ""Nightwing"" is slightly better, due almost entirely to Warner's performance, which remains the film's only redeeming quality beyond Kathryn Harrold's looks.",1053216000,7,3041,4.555963302752294
512833,5,630279756X,"Nightwing has to be the best Horror/Adventure film I have ever seen.  The main star is an Indian reservation law enforcement officer, Deputy Duran.  His job and life around the desert reservation was always boring and uneventfull until people start dying from a particular cause in the form of both bites and plague.  The old man, Abner, who was kind of like a godfather to Duran, has babbled about an ancient Indian curse that was to end the world.  When he is killed by the very thing that he told about and many others keep dying, Duran has to spring in to action with the assistance of a strange British scientist who has dedicated his life to the extermination of the problem, Vampire Bats!  This is an extremely exciting movie which also carries valuable information about the nature of beliefs and customs of the desert indian tribes.

512937,5,630279756X,"The nature-revenge films of the 70s had begun to die down. As it gasped its last breathe in 1979 four films were released, John Frankenheimer's underrated classic-Prophecy, Roger Corman's Up from the Depths, Sergio Martino's The Great Alligator, and of course-Arthur Hiller's Nightwing. Upon its release the film was met with harsh criticism and unfavorable reviews. The film began playing on Cable during the 80s, where it developed a small cult following.

PLOT: Nightwing tells the story of Deputy Duran who begins investigating cattle mutilations on a New Mexico Hopi Indian reservation. Duran was raised by his uncle-Abner, a medicine man who wants to rid the world of human corruption by casting a spell to end it. Eventually Abner dies but his spirit lives on and influences the ""end of days"". A tribal council chairman finds oil shales in a sacred canyon. More attacks occur and Phillip Payne-a bat expert comes forward and explains that a colony of bats living in the area contain the bubonic plague. Naturally the chairman tries to keep things under wraps meanwhile Duran & Phillip set out to stop the bats. However they're driven by Abner & a higher supernatural force which forces Duran to reevaluate his own faith.

The film stars the terrific David Warner (Waxwork, The Omen), Nick Mancuso (Black Christmas, Death Ship), George Clutesi (Prophecy), Charles Hallahan (The Thing), Donald Hotton (The Hearse), and Ben Piazza (Mask). It was  based on a novel by Martin Cruz Smith, who also wrote the screenplay. The effects were done by Carlo Rambaldi who worked on the 1976 remake of King Kong and 1977's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The phenomenal score was composed by Henry Manchini.

My Thoughts: Featuring some goofy bat puppets which are at times fairly well crafted and sometimes poorly animated, Carlo's effects work on Nightwing is a mixed bag. The score on the other hand is absolutely amazing and effective. The film is heavily character driven and at times a tad dull, however small bat attacks and interesting characters amplified by strong performances make the film hold strong. However the story is fairly muddled with an indecisive approach toward the spiritual angle. This supernatural angle sets Nightwing apart from the other nature-gone wrong films of the era. One draw back is the chairman character as he's derivative of the mayor from Jaws which became a character staple in similar films like 1976's Dogs. The direction is solid as are the written elements. The fantastic landscapes of New Mexico are beautifully filmed. The minimal bat attacks are staged quite well regardless of the iffy special effects. In fact the film musters up some atmosphere and even suspense. All in all it's a pretty solid horror-thriller. When compared to other films of its ilk, Nightwing is one of the better efforts. I'd even say it's underrated like 1976's Dogs or 1978's Long Weekend.

Nightwing was released on VHS and as a DVD-R. While the DVD-R is satisfactory it's over priced. Which is why I recommend an official DVD release from Mill Creek. It's included with 3 other low grade films-Kaw, Fatal Contact, and Bats human harvest. Amazon has it marked as When Animals Attack-4-movie set but its actually titled, Animal Apocalypse 4 movie set. It includes no special features but it's remastered with no grain or blemishes. The other films included aren't really good even for b-movie standards except for Kaw. Kaw is a decently made b-movie, the other 2 not so much. It's actually really cheap too, about only 6-8 bucks. Also it's not a DVD-R.

My Rating: While it's plagued with slight absurdity and some weak moments, overall Nightwing is a strong-decent effort, worthy of 4/5 stars.",1435881600,,3715,5.012965964343598

512988,2,630279756X,"I was surprised to find Nightwing available on DVD--but shocked to see the many rave reviews.  I re-watched Nightwing to see if it was better than I remembered but I could barely stay awake all the way through to the end.  It's basically an attempt to do The Birds with vampire bats with a little native American mysticism thrown in.  Unfortunately journeyman director Arthur Hiller is no Alfred Hitchcock--he's not even a Brian De Palma.  Hiller delivers a movie that is slow and dull, has terrible special effects (which Hiller complained about at the time) and which doesn't boast even one exciting sequence.  If you want to watch a bat horror movie the 1999 Lou Diamond Phillips cheapie Bats is a lot more fun.

Nightwing was attacked by the scientific community for its many inaccuracies regarding vampire bats.  In the movie vampire bats swarm and attack cows and people even as they try to escape.  In real life vampire bats normally feed on animals that are asleep.  In the movie vampire bats leave victims that are completely drained of blood--in real life a feeding vampire bat only drinks 1 ounce of blood--to put that in perspective humans have around 160 ounces of blood in their bodies and cows have roughly 1,082 ounces.  In the movie vampire bats leave terrifyingly deep wounds that reach down to bone--in real life vampire bat teeth are so sharp and precise that a sleeping person who is bitten wouldn't even realize it after he woke up--which is a big problem if you get bitten by one that carries rabies.  One other scientific inaccuracy that isn't specifically bat related--in the movie David Warner's bat expert provides a homemade treatment for bubonic plague since there is no medical cure or treatment--in real life bubonic plague is treated successfully with antibiotics.

The movie could have probably used the Native American spiritualism element to explain away the abnormal behavior of the bats--if not for the fact that David Warner's vampire bat expert presents all of that unnatural behavior as being completely normal.  In Nightwing vampire bats aren't animals--they are the demonic flying embodiment of pure evil.  While that obviously isn't fair to vampire bats it was also unnecessary--The Birds got along just fine without turning its attacking creatures into actual monsters.

I can't honestly explain the many good reviews on Amazon but it certainly appears that Nighwing works as a thriller for some people--I can't agree but allowing for the many contrary opinions potential viewers probably need to judge this one for themselves.",1419465600,,2571,5.03066037735849
512989,4,630279756X,"This is less a horror movie about bats than it is a film about greed and the willingness to do anything to anyone in order to gain untold wealth (in this case oil).  The main players are few, some more interesting than others.  The villain of the piece is Walker Chee (Stephen Macht) who abuses his power as a tribal council chairman egregiously (never getting his just deserts).  His plan is to drill for oil on sacred land.  The only person standing in his way is Deputy Youngman Duran (Nick Mancuso).  The deputy has trouble enough of his own to worry about though, dead animals are being discovered low on blood, with unusual bite marks, and the prevailing odor of ammonia in the air.  Before you can say vampire bats, bat expert Phillip Payne (David Warner) shows up ranting about the necessary extinction of the devilish creatures.  As if that wasn't enough, the poor deputy also has to contend with a girlfriend (Kathryn Harrold) who's just announced she's leaving town, and he has angry medicine man Abner (George Clutesi) to deal with (the old man has just confessed he's cast a spell that will end the world.......and then he dies).

The unfortunately problem with this movie is that the elements of `horror' don't arrive until quite late in the feature.  We see evidence of the bat attacks but not the bats until a night sequence, when a small group of missionaries is singing around the campfire.  It's a scene worth waiting for but far too little, far too late, and soon enough the movie goes back to dealing with more mundane matters.  The bats are not the featured players in this storyline; they come off as an afterthought.  Still, there are wonderful performances by Strother Martin and David Warner to enjoy.  And the ending belatedly helped to bring the focus back to the bats, even if only for a few minutes.

It's an interesting movie but by no means could you ever consider it a horror movie.",1408147200,,1915,4.643916913946588

512992,2,630279756X,"Upon watching Nightwing, I asked myself:  Did I watch the same movie as these other reviewers giving it five stars?  I don't see how it's possible.  ""Nightwing"" is one of my favorite Martin Cruz Smith books.  I've read it multiple times, and it's terrifying.  Not so this movie.  It could have been so good, too.  And for someone who didn't even know a movie was ever even made, you can imagine my anticipation upon reading the glowing five-star reviews from others.  My disappointment upon finally seeing it was profound.

Terror?  Horror?  The sheer gross-out of people and animals chewed to pieces and ex-sanguinated by 40,000 voracious vampire bats feeding on unsuspecting victims at night at a remote indian reservation in the desert of Arizona?  Where were those elements?  It's supposed to be a horror story!  Why make the film without an adequate special-effects budget? And the rubber bats?  I can imagine more horror created by an attack of Cabbage Patch Dolls at a poorly attended Halloween party.

Made-for-TV cinematography, if you can call it that.  The whole movie appears to have been filmed at noon, with the exception of two scenes.  No atmosphere at all.  Wooden acting.  Cardboard characters.  And the lighting?  No different than ""The Rockford Files"" or ""Marcus Welby, MD.""  Okay, it's a ""B"" movie, but really more of a ""D.""

So, why two stars?  Two reasons:  Actress Kathryn Harrold, and the truncated musical score by Henry Mancini.  What a disappointment.  Save your money.  Want to be scared?  Read Stephen King's list of good horror films in the latest edition of his essay on horror, ""Danse Macabre.""  That's what I did.",1396915200,,1647,4.923076923076923

513036,3,630279756X,"This film was a problematic endeavor based on the far superior book.  For whatever reason - perhaps because of the misguided criticism (it was a work of fiction after all) the author was taking from some academics - the Hopis and Navajos of Martin Cruz Smith's book were changed to fictional Nation names for the film.  This somewhat undermines the audience's connection between the movie's characters and their Southwest surroundings right from the start.  Worse, however, was the decision to cast actors of European/American descent to play several roles that could have gone to American Indian actors.  For some reason this is still occasionally done with indigenous characters, and it remains a bizarre mistake.  While Stephen Macht and Nick Mancuso turned in fine performances, actual indigenous actors would have been much more appropriate. . .even casting unknowns.  David Warner also did ok, but some of his dialogue was amped up too much for the film and created a character that is occasionally over the top.  The early meeting with Youngman in the Hogan seemed particularly poorly executed and needlessly changed from the dialogue of the book.  Many scenes also feel rushed.

The bat effects in the film are well known and not for their strengths.  Carlo Rambaldi had a solid reputation at the time he was chosen to helm the effects for this film, but for whatever reason he dropped the ball entirely in this picture.  The effects range from mediocre to bad, even for the time.  The film came out when critics were chomping at the bit to tear up anything reminiscent of ""Jaws"" - so the weak effects provided additional fodder.  On the bright side, Henry Mancini's soundtrack is quite good and atmospheric.  Arthur Hiller's direction, while unlikely to win any awards for the film, was not as bad as some critics claimed.  George Clutesi brought a desperately needed indigenous presence to the film and executed his limited character with talent.  While disappointing, this was still much better than the unrelated, horrendous film ""Bats"" that came out twenty years later.  The ""manufactured on demand"" DVD-R from Amazon is a nice print of Nightwing.  Visually the film looks great on the disc.  My three stars are based on both the visual quality of the DVD-R version and the strong points of the film itself.

Very few bad films deserve a second chance, but if you are familiar with the book Nightwing, you are probably aware of that story's untapped potential.  I would like to see this film remade, with an even closer adherence to the storyline while still set in the time it was written, with more indigenous actors in the key roles.  Improved special effects certainly wouldn't hurt.  It isn't likely to happen, but it could prove a lot more interesting than much of the nonsense coming out nowadays.",1346025600,5,2817,4.934182590233545

513071,5,630279756X,"Growing up in the late seventies I was a huge fan of many of the thrillers that were modeled in a sense after the classic ""Jaws"".  Out of the many I saw (Orca:  The Killer Whale"", ""Alligator"" among others.) ""Nightwing"" was my favorite.  I enjoyed it so much that it's flaws do not take away from it's enjoyment and overall appeal.  I was happy to hear the movie was finally available on DVD through Amazon.

The DVD is a very simple one.  There is no chapter selection (Though you will be able to skip to chapters as the movie plays.) and the only special feature is the movie trailer.  It would have been nice to have a commentary from the cast and/or director, but the DVD is of very good quality regardless.

Youngman Duran is a Maskai indian who lives on the tribe's reservation and works as a police officer.  The man who has raised him since the death of his parents is a tribal priest named Abner.  Duran greatly admires Abner but worries about Abner's sanity.  One day on a visit to him, Abner tells Duran that he will call upon the indian god Yehwah to ""end the world.""  The next day Duran finds Abner dead under mysterious circumstances.  Shortly thereafter the reservation is plagued by a huge swarm of vampire bats who launch devestating attacks at night.

A great reason for the movie's appeal is it's cast.  Despite instances of cornball dialogue, the main actors actually do well in their respective roles.  They did not deserve to win Oscars, but on the other hand they did not deserve to win Razzies either.  The standout is David Warner as scientist Phillip Payne.  Warner has had a long distinguished carrer in movies (""Tron"", ""Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country"", ""Titanic"") and television (""Star Trek:  The Next Genaration"" ""A Christmas Carol"") and has never given a bad performance in anything I have seen.  His performance in ""Nightwing"" as a man on a mission to hunt down and destroy vampire bats is no exception.  Warner's over the top speech to Duran as to why he is so passionate about killing vampire bats is a little too much but still enjoyable.  Seeing Payne at work as he searches for the bats works well also.  Another strong point is Nick Mancuso as Youngman Duran.  Despite being Italian he is very believable in his role as a Maskai indian.  There are times when his dialogue is a bit silly, but those moments are few and far between.  Kathryn Harrold stars as Duran's love interest.  She is the weakest character in the film but she gives as good a performance as the script will allow.

The scene where the bats make their first appearance in the movie actually works quite well despite the fact that the special effects are not quite first rate.  I have seen the movie a number of times and the movie still scares from time to time.  The final showdown with the bats is not perfect but still is quite thrilling and gives the movie a satisfying conclusion.

""Nightwing"" does have it's problems but is still very good entertainment and, I believe at least, has stood the test of time.",1334880000,,3026,4.566914498141264
513072,3,630279756X,I saw this movie back in the 80's and it left a lasting impression.  I love the soundtrack (Henry Mancini). The storyline is decent.  Definitely a classic.,1333497600,,155,4.703703703703703
513073,4,630279756X,I believe this is one of the best modern Sci-fi films available. Story and plot good and believable. Story moves along at a good speed with very good action. Photography is well done with great scereny from South-West.,1330992000,,218,4.7631578947368425

513075,4,630279756X,"There is no menu or chapter selection option on this DVD...only the movie.  But this is the only DVD printing of this movie, so beggars can't be choosers.

While it's an older movie, it's theme is
surprisingly current. Both with the oil
issues and the ending of the fourth
world.
And somehow those cheesy old special
effects are scarier than the over done-
""missing a story"" computer graphics we
use today.
Nice coiff Nick! Tee hee:)!!",1320192000,,319,5.037735849056604

513078,4,630279756X,"So how much more cheesy can a flick get?  Watch this one and you will truly see what it is that Cheese fans love about this movie.  A fave of ours from our childhood, this one was a must have for our library.  If you like your special effects just shy of seeing the fishing wire, the actors cut from the same mold as a hundred other B range hammers, then this movie is for you.  Theres plague, nature as purposefully evil and filthy dirty greedy land grabbers.  Grab a bowl of popcorn, the hunny of your choice and a cold glass of sugary goodness, this is a great ride and a keeper for any dvd collection.",1308528000,,605,4.136752136752137
513079,4,630279756X,"This is a dvd-on-demand from Sony, and they did a good job on the transfer. The widescreen image is colorful and clear (no 'washout'),looking better than it probably ever will (I noticed very little if any dirt or scratches), especially during the evening and morning shots out in the desert (e.g. Canyon de Chelly). Since this is a bare-bones release, there isn't even a scene selection option, though there is a good trailer (not the 1979 teaser but a lengthier trailer). The sound is a good balance of the melancholy Henry Mancini score, voices and some shrill sound effects in all your TV speakers during the bat attack scenes. It is a shame that they didn't get the running commentary by star Nick Mancuso and producer Martin Ransahoff (which is available for listening on the Internet), but I'm thankful to Sony/Columbia Pictures for finally making this available, and it's probably not going to get any better than this unless it happens to find its way to Blu-Ray. If you're a fan of this film, then get it while you can.",1306108800,17,1029,4.722222222222222
