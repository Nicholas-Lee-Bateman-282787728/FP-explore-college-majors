8689633,5,B00PX7SPIE,"This is one of the best films to ever come out of Hollywood. Randolph Scott, Irene Dunne, Elizabeth Patterson, Dorothy Lamour, Alan Hale -- all these famous golden age actors shine under the direction of one of the true golden age masters, Mamoulian, who had already made the classic films ""Applause,"" ""City Streets,"" ""Love Me Tonight,"" the best version of ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" with Frederic March and would go on to make what remains the best Zorro film with Tyrone Power and Basil Rathbone: ""Mark of Zorro."" What's really great about this film is the balance it maintains between humor, drama, romance AND giving the audience a little bit of a history lesson on both American entrepreneurship and dirty ""business practices"" in the 19th century. Too bad the DVD is  ""bare bones"" with only an average transfer of the film --- but for any true film fan, this is a testament to what was once possible in Hollywool when great art and jolly entertainment would cross-over and overlap each others' realms far more often than they do now.",1477526400,3,1035,4.75
8689634,5,B00PX7SPIE,"After James Whale's 1936 SHOW BOAT, this is one of the liveliest and most idiomatic Kern musicals on film--the modern and period songs are perfectly integrated into the antebellum oil-boom scenario--from the same year as his progressive SWING TIME, and with an even richer score than Kern's related period-Americana celebrations SWEET ADELINE, CENTENNIAL SUMMER and CAN'T HELP SINGING (but not richer than ROBERTA, whose stars Dunne and Scott are ideally recast here). Adeline, Roberta and SHOW BOAT were adapted from legendarily successful Broadway runs, while HIGH, WIDE AND HANDSOME was mounted directly for the screen with an original story by lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II and screenplay by George O'Neil. Best of all the innovative Broadway and Hollywood director Rouben Mamoulian gave the project its stylish meld of broad storyline with sublime keeper songs. It's a monochrome film, shot by Victor Milner and Theodor Sparkuhl, but Mamoulian keeps the cameras moving and his alert direction of diverse talents (including circus elephants) is in the sinewy and bravura mode of King Vidor in OUR DAILY BREAD or AN AMERICAN ROMANCE.

Hammerstein and Kern recapitulated successful elements of SHOW BOAT here (as they'd shamelessly done in SWEET ADELINE), with shantyboat entertainers, snake-oil salesmen and the P.T. Barnum circus typifying the 1859 Alleghenies performance circuit. Beyond the oil-boom theme (nicely elaborated in struggles over rail vs. pipeline carriage), fire is a constant visual motif, as in Dunne's glamourously staged Barnum gig, so too the apple blossoms of rural Pennsylvania. These are the backdrops for six Kern songs: the title number, ""Can I forget you?"" and ""Folks who live on the hill"" sung by Dunne, ""Will you marry me tomorrow, Maria?"" sung by William Frawley and two very intriguing solos for Dorothy Lamour, ""Things I want"" and ""Allegheny Al,"" both now neglected in the Kern catalogue. Dunne's ballads immediately became permanent Kern standards, contain some of his finest music and are Hammerstein at his most poetic and least sanctimonious or saccharine. These song orchestrations were made by the great Broadway arranger Robert Russell Bennett.

The period costumes are by Travis Banton in his highest Paramount style, and Dunne, Scott and Lamour have wonderful ensemble support from Elizabeth Patterson (who croaks some strains from the title song), Raymond Walburn, Charles Bickford, Akim Tamiroff, Ben Blue, Frawley and Alan Hale. It's a larger-scale (high, wide and very handsome) visual cavalcade covering an interesting chapter in American history, antebellum showbiz styles filtered through the sophisticated Broadway sensibilities of its creators, and essential viewing for Kern and Dunne completists--vividly colorful in its own way even without the enhancement of Kalmus Technicolor. (Irene Dunne introduced or perfected more Kern standards than any other singer, including Fred Astaire, and her five Kern films made sequentially 1934-38 are SWEET ADELINE, ROBERTA, SHOW BOAT, HIGH WIDE AND HANDSOME and JOY OF LIVING, with this film having musical values on par with its two immediate predecessors.)",1475884800,,3153,5.539419087136929
8689635,4,B00PX7SPIE,"Nice to watch these old classics.  How refreshing to see a movie without every other word being the ""F"" word (Do today's families REALLY use the ""F"" word every other word in all of their conversations even those with their children???), bare T&A and humping.  Too bad the morals of this country have hit the gutter.  We used to be a respected country but now we are a laughable one.  Don't believe it?  Just take a trip Overseas.  It will be an eyeopener.",1457049600,,455,4.421686746987952

8689640,4,B00PX7SPIE,"In trying to figure out how to describe this, I like the reviewer who called it ""Epic storytelling with music"". It's not really a musical, since only Irene Dunne and Dorothy Lamour sing, and Dotty only does a quivering duet with Irene that harks back to SHOWBOAT. Apart from that, it's also an historical epic, a romance and a comedy, with a jaw-droppingly wonderful finale. Hammerstein always was drawn to American history as source material, and this one deals with the Pennsylvania oil boom, and the Railroad Barons who tried to keep it to themselves. I'm dropping one star only because the music, with the exception of ""The Folks Who Live on the Hill"" isn't all that memorable. Still, it's a little known gem, and a must-have for musical fans.",1431129600,3,747,4.753846153846154
