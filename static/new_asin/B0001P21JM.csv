8015912,5,B0001P21JM,"A beautiful, but dangerous 21st Centry Russian gypsy ensares an emotional and naive lover. The film provides a post-USSR rendition of a classic love-lust story with a tragic ending.  It is a disturbing  update of the 19th century story used as the basis for Bizet's well-known opera.  In my view this film is artistically conceived and executed.  It is satisfying intellectually and emotionally challenging.

Of special interst to people who appreciate serious pop music is the use of a Nochnie Sniperi (Nighttime Snipers) song, Tolka Ti (Only You), as part of the soundtrack.  The disc has an interesting bonus interview with one of the Nochnie Sniperi founders as well as two song videos by Nochnie Sniperi.  This group was much loved in Russia and other countries that were part of the former USSR, but unfortunately they are vitually unknown in the USA.",1194048000,,857,4.992957746478873
