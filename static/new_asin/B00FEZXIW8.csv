5985963,5,B00FEZXIW8,"Most of my family are big LOTR fans, so when we checked this out.

We've watched this movie now 6 times and it's one that my kids (11, 4 and 2) have asked for now on multiple occasions. It's got some really heartfelt moments and some great comedy as well.

What I really appreciate is the fact that there's so many LOTR'ish moments throughout. Loved that.

I highly recommend this movie! No foul language and great for all of the fellow Hobbits out there. :-)",1381363200,6,459,4.376470588235295
5985964,5,B00FEZXIW8,"There are indie movies that wish they were amazing, then there are indie movies that ARE amazing. This film is certainly of the latter camp!

""Rise of the Fellowship"" is not only a love letter to the famous Lord of the Rings franchise, but also a cleverly-charismatic buddy movie. The film follows four lovable gaming geeks on their quest to a Lord of the Rings Online competition, chronicling their adventures from ""borrowing"" the military academy's car to playing paintball in a hippie compound, all the while paralleling the scenes we remember and love from the Peter Jackson trilogy!

The film's writing is carefully crafted in a positive way, and makes ""Rise of the Fellowship"" a movie the whole family can enjoy. The performances by the cast are genuine and organic, a characteristic rarely seen in independent film. Another element in which many independent films tend to fail, and this one doesn't, is in the realm of effects; ""Rise of the Fellowship"" does not make the mistake of trying to be bigger than it is - instead, it showcases good costuming and makeup but does not try to overdo itself in the effects department. Lead composer Dale Clay conceives a score worthy of the film's A-list counterparts, taking after the style of Howard Shore without mimicking the cues from the Jackson movies.

All in all, this film is not 100% perfect, but it's as close to complete perfection than most independent films come. Ron Newcomb and Scott Matthias have a gem for a first film, and I look forward to the many films to come from Opening Act in the future!",1381276800,25,1561,4.774074074074074
5985965,4,B00FEZXIW8,"The synopsis of this movie doesn't do it justice at all. This isn't just a ripoff Fellowship of the Ring movie, it's a heartfelt, comedic tale of a bunch of regular nerds who go on a modern day journey akin to the hobbits in the Lord of the Rings. Movie and book references galore, as well as some actual Lord of the Rings online game play scenes. Give it a watch, it's not bad!",1381276800,35,378,4.121621621621622
5985966,4,B00FEZXIW8,"If you love Lord of the Rings you will definitely love this adventure story! A group of friends who love video games want to enter a local competition. Instead, they find themselves marginalized by the owner of the local game store, but matters are made worse when our hero is framed for a crime he didn't commit, getting him expelled from school.

The team of friends embark on an epic adventure to an annual competition in Florida to reclaim glory and prove our heroes innocence.

The adventure takes this unlikely fellowship across the country, meeting many wonderful people and proves that even the most unlikely person can stand up and fight.

Great performances, a gripping story and many Lord of the Rings references makes this an excellent film and one I would recommend with my whole heart!",1381104000,3,799,4.817518248175182

Sure, cliches exist but these are intentional cliches from LOTR. Somtimes, move is more than a spoof but a love letter to LOTR fans and video game fans.",1494115200,,306,4.293103448275862

5985969,1,B00FEZXIW8,"The worst movie I have ever watched on Amazon. The whole movie you feel like you do when someone is making a fool out of themselves and you can't get away, you are forced to watch it. I kept expecting it to turn and be like Best in Show, or Waiting for Guffman  when they were intentionally making fun of a group of people. ( gaming nerds) ......but evidently it was written by gaming nerds and no one really told them what a horrible piece of dung this thing was before they were allowed to release it. Everyone involved in this dumpster fire needs to have their SAG card revoked. ...... and maybe I'm a little over the top here....but I think there should be at least some discussion about prison terms.  my suggestions

Mostly, I think it's all a matter of whether or not you get the references and have familiarity with the subculture. Tons of chuckles from me. A great random pick for my night. If you've ever played an MMORPG, if you've seen the LOTR films, you should watch this for sure. If not, well, maybe play some catch-up first. I definitely enjoyed this film.

5985998,5,B00FEZXIW8,"Rise of the Fellowship is an Indy spoof of gamers and the Fellowship of the Ring, produced and directed by Ron Newcomb.  With Lord of the Rings gags sprinkled throughout, the film is consistently entertaining from the opening monologue (a spoof of the introduction to the Fellowship of the Ring movie) through to the credit crawl (yep, a spoof of the LOTR credits).  Unlike most Indy films, it maintains very high production values and surprisingly good acting quality as well as well-paced action, never bogging down in boring filler or exposition.

The writers (Christopher Bunn, Scott Mathias, and Ron Newcomb) show remarkable understanding of and sensitivity toward the characters' personalities and social situations, all delivered with flair for cerebral comedy far better than anything coming out of Hollywood these days.

If you're not at least familiar with The Lord of the Rings in book or movie form, a lot of the gags will sail right over your head.  The game they play is The Lord of the Rings Online, which is not generally a player-vs-player game, but is presented as one in this film.  It is possible to play a monster in LOTRO, as do the jerks in the movie.",1475625600,7,1174,4.845

A solid three and one-half stars rounded up to four to balance out some of the unfavorable reviews it's been recently receiving thus encouraging people to take a peek. Personally, I liked the adaptation of the fellowship theme but can probably relate better to the first-generation gamer drop-out turned ""hippie"" better than most people. Nothing intellectually stimulating, thought provoking, especially artistic, or morally redeeming about this flick -- just good basic entertainment for some like me.

5986025,4,B00FEZXIW8,"This movie grabbed me near the beginning when the teacher said that she expected their essays by Friday and to include the relevance of minorities, sexism, feminism, the ethical treatment of animals, classism, organism, pluralism, wiccanism, environmentalism, western imperialism, etc. The list delivered in a true Ben Stein monotone straight out of Ferris Buller's Day Off.  Nothing says education like a boring pinhead telling her students what to think.

It almost lost me when the audience was supposed to feel sympathy for the kid caught with marijuana in his locker.  After all, it's just marijuana.  Just harmless fun.  For kids.  But then we learn that the drugs were planted by the school bully and our hero doesn't even take aspirin.  So now we feel sympathy for the kid because he is a victim, not a pot head.

The movie bounces around from the clever to the mundane to the simply boring.  A mixed bag.  Some of the humor will be lost on those unfamiliar with the Lord of the Rings.  Despite complaints by other reviewers, I thought the actors were fine.  All in all if you are a LOTR fan, you may find this movie amusing.  At least watch it until you get to see the boring teacher.

August 12, 2016.  I had to revisit this review.  Hillary Clinton, in referring to Trump supporters said, The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic  you name it.  For real humor find a recording of the ""basket of deplorables"" part of Clinton's speech and compare it to the teacher in this movie.  Amazing.  How can parody beat real life for humor in today's world?

I chose to watch this because I thought it was going to be a corny rip off of Lord of the Rings but instead the movie is actually some kind of tribute to it, its director, and the ""gaming community"" (ie losers).  I will say the movie had a coherent plot, (which is a lot more than what I can say about most other free movies on amazon prime) but this movie is intended for a particularly narrow audience (that being persons of the gaming community between the ages of 6 - 13).

There are plenty of LOTR references and some direct homage even, but the real story is about four friends on a quest for justice. The acting is entirely adequate to the scope of the film. The script is a little forced in places but still enjoyable for the most part and not as predictable as I predicted.

(I still can't wrap my head around the premise that the hero's mom didn't seem able to fight to get him un-expelled....) Anyway... not that it's a big deal, but it's difficult to tell that it takes place between 2010 and 2013 because no one has an iPhone and the USB drive looks really clunky and old. Also, most of the high school actors do look older than high school. (And, they were okay. No major flubs in lines or in the scenes.) The value-driven message about being a good sport and not cheating is very clear and there is a mild anti-drug message.

It's a fresh, fun movie with fresh, young kids.  They all did a wonderful job, those kids.  And Babba, what a fun character!

I gave this five stars because I more than liked it, but also because I'm a die hard trilogy going (this September in Columbus, OH baby!) LotR fangirl and this was a respectful homage, made me laugh, and the main kid's acting was quite good plus it was a unique original and just plan good.

The good-guy crew is a little silly, but I have to admit they have their own charm. The inclusion of a cool ""gamer-chick,"" and the idea of being able to have a part-time job at an actual RPG store (not comics and Magic the Gathering with 10 random 5th Ed.

Luring in unsuspecting viewers with a wry, witty ADVERTISEMENT surrounding the legendary Tolkien, I just could not believe the obvious pandering, the wanna-be-PYTHON's of yore.  Nothing even close. This stuff is on a par with comic books, except I think the books are much more superior, plus a possible source of disposable income. However, I am not discussing comic books OR income, disposable or not. I am trying, in a serious vein, to positively think of some area where I was given something worth reviewing at all.  I just couldn't. There is simply nothing here worth thinking, writing, dreaming, obsessing or idolizing about.  Nothing. Bland as creme of cream soup. That would HAVE to be bland.

 From a simple acting standing point this is generally a 2 star attempt.  Which the viewer has to suffer through.  But this is rewarded as the viewer comes upon many well done scenes involving cinematography and witty dialogue and 4 star moments of comedy and timing
.  Overall it's like a series of  SNL skits about teenagers caught up in their passion for LOTR and gaming.
For myself, I ended up giving it four stars for the overall effort that the viewer goes through as well.  A journey.  You'll suffer through inept amateurish tedium in the movie only to be rewarded periodically with what you were hoping for - The cast pulls it off in delightful ways.
It's worth it",1389657600,2,955,4.630952380952381
5986283,3,B00FEZXIW8,"Realizing that ""fellows-hip"" actually presents itself as a B-grade/indie movie (satirical), I'd give it four stars on the level of communicating with the committed L-O-T-R (Lord of the Rings) fan, such as myself.  I was once a teen-age Dungeons and Dragons player, and it's a plot addressing exactly that level of hubris.  If you don't know Tolkien's story lines, then most of the satirical puns will be wasted on you.  Sound effects and video shorts of the characters imaginations are INTENDED to convey delusional self esteem of the role PLAYERS.  It's all part of the fun of RPG's (role playing games) to act out the persona of a game character with abilities you or I would never actually possess.

What's more surprising are the unfolding revelations about who the villains and the allies really turn out to be.  There are elements of the story that remind me a lot of the video&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-Stories/dp/B0081XZCP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War Stories</a>.  There's a missing dad, a mystery, some teen-age friends attempting to sort things out for themselves.  A degree of situational humor is achieved through injecting stupendous luck into the proceedings to deliver what would otherwise be, most implausible.  When it comes to blatant stereotyping, there's no sacred cows here.  Some authorities come across as utter block-heads, others are helpful.  Some hippies are subtly aggrandized, others are selfish and vindictive.

I didn't have the technology they have.  But I've been to conventions and gaming marathons with these fellows.  Disrespect their creativity at your expense.",1389484800,3,1655,5.594377510040161

The fact that the heroes in this quest are engaging young people makes this movie a must-see for ages 10 to 17 (all ages really!)

Each of the lead actors does a very good job, especially Justin Moe and Jayme Bell. Wolf Sherrill as Baba Melvin is a delight. The sly humor of the script drew me in. Its well paced.

Disclosure: I only watched this because a friend is married to one of the writers. But as I watched, I moved from curiosity to pride. Who cares about 4 teen gamers? You will when you watch this well told tale.",1388448000,5,655,4.360655737704918

5986293,5,B00FEZXIW8,"Short version: this movie rocks.

I'm a Lord of the Rings fan--both Tolkien's literary masterwork and Peter Jackson's cinematic adaptation (which I rambled on about just a few posts ago)--as well as a fan of fantasy and sci-fi in general and an independent filmmaker myself....but generally not a fan of parodies or spoof-style movies, so I had some initial hesitation about what to expect from this film. However, I was delighted to find that Rise of the Fellowship is something distinct and entirely its own, which, truly, is its biggest strength.  While it *does* pay very respectable homage to Tolkien (with, for example, the inclusion of the Tom Bombadil-esque character Baba Melvin) and, too, to Jackson's cinematic style, the story is solid and accessible to moviegoers outside the fan bases onto whom the film would otherwise seem to be focused.  It's a real thrill to any audience member; one who is a part of the fantasy and/or gaming communities or not.  That is, at least to me, one of the biggest difficulties in any adaptive-film project and this film absolutely succeeds with it.  As an audience member, it made my experience of the film more enjoyable than I could have predicted.

My other personal favorite aspects of the film are the pacing and tone; the comedy and seriousness are perfectly balanced and the nerd-factor is never overdone.  These gamers, as the film's heroes and main characters, aren't exaggeratedly dorky or comedic, but neither are they excessively solemn or glorified.  It's inspirational, but light.  It's serious, but also fun.  The cast is excellent, the cinematography and production design are gorgeous and the musical score is beautiful.

So, to sum up: I'll recommend this film to anyone who'll listen.  Check it out!",1388188800,13,1764,5.044827586206897

5986295,3,B00FEZXIW8,"This is a cute flick for the family, it's like Scoobie-Doo LARPing An Unexpected Journey for Nickelodeon (sans-budget) and pretty well done, comic-style- nice use of funds. Cameo of circa 80s Fabio as hipster tree-hugger (nice blue eyes). The gang from Dynasty High are set-up (illegal substance planted in locker) at the moment of a major gaming competition, though, the hero has proof of the treachery thus leads the LARPing journey barefoot to the big competition, ""There's a little bit of Geek & Hero in all of us"" sums it up.

5986302,4,B00FEZXIW8,"Rise of the Fellowship is a glorious love letter to both the Lord of the Rings and the world of gaming, with just a touch of John Hughes for seasoning.
We are introduced to a quartet of dedicated young geeks who go to school and play Lord of the Rings Online together while trying to avoid the typically abusive jock squad.  This and other tropes such as our hero Randall being hopelessly In love with the lead cheerleader will be very  familiar to anyone who grew up watching movies in the 1980s.
Things take an interesting turn though when a Lord of the Rings Online competition is announced and the jocks attempt to beat the geeks at their own game.  They seem to do so but only through the use of trickery and in order to right this wrong, Randall, Stacy, Squirelly and Nate set out on an epic quest for truth, justice and the gamer way.
Astute fans of the Lord of the Rings trilogy will notice that Rise of the Fellowship plays homage to many elements from those movies and even crafts its own storyline to roughly follow that of the trilogy.  Since this is only one movie and not three, that mechanism leads to certain things getting a bit muddled and hurried at some points but overall, it works.
The acting is surprisingly good, especially considering that it is a small independent film, with the standout being the films director who plays Randalls older brother Stan.  The character development is also handled well, with one possible exception.  But as that is tied to a significant plot twist others may find it justified.
Finally, the film also gets high marks for its sound track and topnotch production values.  All of these elements combine to make a film that will be appreciated by many for the light-hearted homage and geek rallying cry that it is.  Definitely give it a look!",1386979200,4,1796,4.573208722741433

Like other reviewers have mentioned, this is NOT just some sort of parody of the Lord of the Rings movies--it stands on its own, and though a knowledge of the Lord of the Rings movies would help you appreciate its cleverness, I wouldn't say it's absolutely essential. I would recommend it to anyone, really; it's easy to empathize with the plot's motifs (journey, good overcoming evil, young love, etcplus the struggles of high school) and become emotionally invested in the characters. Plus there's enough action to keep things interesting.  You don't have to be a huge Lord of the Rings fan (or even a gamer) to appreciate its clever (and--dare I say-- relatable) plot.",1386547200,5,719,4.845528455284553

5986307,4,B00FEZXIW8,"The story centers around a group of school-age gamers on a quest to a Lord of the Rings (LotR) Online competition. And since it's a quest your can guess what story their journey parallels -- including a stand-in for the One Ring.

This is clearly an indie film with an indie budget, so you won't see hordes of rampaging orcs or even excessive SyFy Channel CGI. What you do get is a charming homage to LotR amid a fun look at gamers. There's plenty of details to appreciate from the sound design of their version of the Nazgul to security guards and other minor villains who think (and are therefore far more of a threat).

Also, having seen way too many indie films that loudly proclaim they were ""shot on the RED camera"" that appeared gray and dull, it was nice to see these filmmakers using it to get some beautiful shots of their non-Middle Earth.

Odds are if you're not a fan of Lord of the Rings and aren't at least a bit of a gamer, you won't enjoy the film as much. In addition, if you need profanity and nihilistic violence, this is not the indie for you. It's reasonably family-friendly.

If you're up for a well-made indie affair about some gamer geeks going on the hero's journey, you'll probably enjoy it.",1384646400,3,1218,4.424107142857143

Randall and his friends are gaming geeks who practically live in the digital wilds of Middle Earth in the MMO Lord of the Rings Online, and they are the best at what they play.  When the National Competition in Florida is announced, Randall and his team, The Radigast Raiders, face off against The Shire Sherriffs, led by Joe, a jock who constantly bullies Randall and his friends.  On the day of the qualifying match, the Raiders are a man down after Randall had been expelled from school and barred from entering the competition.  The Sherriffs win and head to the Nationals, but Randall and his friends suspect something more insidious is at work.  When their suspicions are confirmed, the ""precious"" information is saved to a golden flash drive (The One Ring), and the digital fellowship comes to life as Randall and his friends venture to Florida to present the evidence to the gaming commissioner.  Along the way, things become more perilous when their car breaks down, and find a mysterious black rider pursuing them.  Braving the wilds of Virginia, the group finds help in an unlikely place, and Randall learns the true meaning of loyalty, love and family.

Inspired by the literary works of J.R.R. Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings films of Peter Jackson, Rise of the Gamers is an encouraging adventure the whole family will enjoy.",1384214400,3,1488,4.853754940711463
