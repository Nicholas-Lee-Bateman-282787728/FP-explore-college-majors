8635944,5,B00HUL8IQK,"PAPA LONGUES JAMBES [Daddy Long Legs] [1955] [Blu-ray] [French Import] Fred Astaire is Daddy Long Legs!

`Daddy Long Legs' is a Hollywood musical comedy film set in France, New York City, and the fictional college town of ""Walston"" in Massachusetts. The film was directed by Jean Negulesco, and stars Fred Astaire, Leslie Caron, Terry Moore, Fred Clark, and Thelma Ritter, with music and lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The screenplay was written by Phoebe Ephron and Henry Ephron, loosely based on the 1912 novel ""Daddy-Long-Legs"" by Jean Webster.

Wealthy American Jervis Pendleton III [Fred Astaire] has a chance encounter at a French orphanage with a cheerful 18-year-old resident, Julie Andre [Leslie Caron]. He anonymously pays for her education at a New England college. She writes letters to her mysterious benefactor regularly, but he never writes back. Her nickname for him, `Daddy Long Legs,' is taken from the description of him given to Julie Andre by some of her fellow orphans who see his shadow as he leaves their building.

FILM FACT: Awards and Nominations: Academy Awards: Nominated: Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color for Lyle R. Wheeler, John DeCuir, Walter M. Scott, Paul S. Fox. Nominated: Best Music, Original Song for Johnny Mercer, for the song ""Something's Gotta Give."" Nominated: Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture for Alfred Newman. Writers Guild of America Award: Nominated: Best Written American Musical for Phoebe Ephron and Henry Ephron. `Daddy Long Legs' was Fred Astaire's first and only film musical at 20th Century Fox. It was also the first and only time he co-starred with Leslie Caron, who at the time, was still under contract to M-G-M, but was also loaned out to 20th Century Fox for this production. The film was one of Fred Astaire's personal favourites, largely due to the script which, for once, directly addresses the complications inherent in a love affair between a young woman and a man thirty years her senior.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Fred Astaire made his only appearance in a 20th Century-Fox picture in `Daddy Long Legs' [1955], the much-filmed story of a millionaire who anonymously sponsors, then falls in love with a young orphan [Leslie Caron]. Although some critics complained that the two stars were too far apart in age to make a suitable romantic couple, once they started dancing, in their only film together, all thoughts of age differences were banished. And it helped that they had a sprightly hit from Johnny Mercer, ""Something's Gotta Give,"" that accounted for one of the film's three OSCAR nominations, the others were for Best Art Direction and Best Scoring of a Musical.

As Fred Astaire grew older, he lost none of his grace as a dancer, but his leading ladies were getting progressively younger. The 1912 novel by Jean Webster, the grandniece of Mark Twain, had been filmed three times previously. The story is of an orphan given a college education by an older unseen benefactor who woos her. When the studio contacted Fred Astaire about playing the lead he was happy to do a film that treated his age as a plot element. 20th Century Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck had envisioned `Daddy Long Legs' as a vehicle for contract musical star Mitzi Gaynor, but Fred Astaire insisted the role go to Leslie Caron, whose work he had admired since Gene Kelly had cast her in `An American in Paris' [1951]. As a result, the script was re-written to have Fred Astaire discover her during a visit to France.

Fred Astaire's friend Johnny Mercer provided most of the songs, creating both words and music, though he was primarily known as a lyricist. The hit of the film was ""Something's Gotta Give,"" which was recorded by The Maguire Sisters. `Daddy Long Leg's also revived Johnny Mercer's 1945 hit ""Dream."" During the ""Daydream Sequence"" in which Fred Astaire imagines Leslie Caron's fantasies of him as a Texas cowboy, an international playboy and her guardian angel and his cowboy voice was dubbed by Thurl Ravenscroft, the voice of Tony the Tiger and the singer who introduced ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch."" That was the only time Fred Astaire's voice was ever dubbed.

This was Fred Astaire's first film in CinemaScope, and he planned the choreography to take advantage of what was then a new shape for the film image. In particular, he used the screen format to create distance between himself and Leslie Caron in their dance to ""Something's Gotta Give"" and to fill the screen with activity in the ""Daydream Sequence."" Fred Astaire also incorporated ballet elements into the choreography to showcase Leslie Caron, whose background was in classical dance. She executed a variety of dance steps at the climax of the ""Daydream Sequence"" as he danced around her, and he used pirouettes and other twirling steps in their dance to ""Dream."" The number also includes a rarity in his choreography, a kiss. Unfortunately, Fred Astaire had no connection to the ""Nightmare Ballet,"" a 12-minute sequence staged by Leslie Caron's first mentor, Roland Petit.

The CinemaScope screen also gave ample opportunities to the art department, which gave `Daddy Long Legs' a lavish look befitting its international setting and Fred Astaire's character. They redressed the Los Angeles International Airport to fill in for LaGuardia and shot exteriors for Fred Astaire's New York home at Andrew Carnegie's Fifth Avenue mansion. Portraits of Fred Astaire, his father and grandfather were painted in the styles of Picasso, John Singer Sargent and James Abbott McNeill Whistler, respectively, with director Jean Negulesco supplying Fred Astaire's portrait. He also painted posters for the ""Nightmare Ballet"" and used his artistic connections to borrow paintings by Picasso, Matisse, Braque and Claudette Colbert to fill out Fred Astaire's gallery.

20th Century Fox also gave the film a solid supporting cast to help carry the comedy in Phoebe Ephron and Henry Ephron's adaptation.  Thelma Ritter stole every scene she was in as Fred Astaire's secretary, while Terry Moore was suitably pretty and sympathetic as Leslie Caron's college roommate. One of Fred Astaire's dancing partners in the ""Daydream Sequence"" was the young Barrie Chase, who would team up with him memorably in a pair of 1960s television specials. `Daddy Long Legs' is also the only film to feature both actors who played Bea Benaderet's husband, Harry Morton, on The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, plus Fred Clark and Larry Keating.

Sharp-eyed spotters should look among the many actresses billed as ""College Student"" to find Barrie Chase in Cape Fear [1962]; Diane Jergens in The FBI Story [1959]; Lisa Montell in World Without End [1956]; Leslie Parrish in The Manchurian Candidate [1962] and Pat Sheehan in Space Cowboys [2000].

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox offers us a top quality encoded 1080p image, virtually devoid of any defects or scratches. Regarding the definition, the Blu-ray offers a very nice result if we note that certain images show an average definition, these are rare and the rest of the film remains a good level. Of course, the depth of field is not impressive, but the detail is rich and corresponds exactly to what we can expect from such a film on Blu-ray. The colour is stable, offering a beautiful array of bright colours but not excessively. Encoding generates no obvious flaws, but film lovers of grain may regret smoothing a bit forced. Overall, this Blu-ray therefore has a very nice image and to rediscover the film Jean Negulesco in conditions never reached before. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The two soundtracks are French 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio and English 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio and of course you have to manually select what language you want view it in. The original English version is very good and convincing spatial dynamism; this is not the case of the French version. This rather strident runway is closed with sharp dialogues that crush the rest of the sound spectrum. Besides the contrast can be seen very quickly during voice original musical numbers. One more reason to see this film in its original English language version!

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Jazz Fred Astaire [45:00] Divided into two parts, this documentary is a radio TSF Jazz illustrated with a series of photos looping. It is unfortunate that this doc is not accompanied by pictures or videos staged so as to enrich the comments of stakeholders. That said, the show is interesting: many experts come to talk about Fred Astaire and his report to the Jazz. Among these, we find Philippe Labro, NT Bihn, Yves Boisset and dance specialists, jazz etc. Comments are interspersed with songs and the whole is mixed with elegance. French Language and no English Subtitles.

Special Feature: Daddy Long Legs by Leslie Caron [3:00] Always in the same format as the previous documentary, this extract can listen the actress back on his meeting and his work with Fred Astaire. But unfortunately it is all in French and you only get one black and white image still from the film. French Language and no English Subtitles.

Original Theatrical Trailer [1955] [2:34] This is an unrestored film trailer allows us to appreciate the work done for Blu-ray. It is a shame they could not of cleaned this up, as you get lots of white speckles throughout the trailer.

Finally, all in all then, `Daddy Long Legs' is a brilliant diversion for Fred Astaire's tenure as the greatest dancer on film. It's neither terribly disappointing, nor up to the standards of previous or subsequent endeavours in his body of work. The anamorphic Blu-ray transfer from 20th Century Fox is remarkable in both its clarity, detail and colour fidelity. Rich, vibrant hues and deep saturation make for a stunning visual presentation augmented no doubt by Leon Shamroy's elegant direction of photography. Fine details are present throughout. Age related artefacts are practically non-existent. The audio is typically garish stereophonic 1950s full channel and robust, hearty and loud whenever possible and quite brassy in Johnny Mercer's scoring. The Gallic charm of the film gives it a lovely layer of charm and the sheer innocence of the performances give it a really adorable romantic feel. If you are a Fred Astaire fan or you just love classic films then this one is well worth purchasing this excellent Blu-ray disc. The only disappointment with the Extras, which is a shame they could not have added English Subtitles, as I am sure they know people outside France will want to purchase this brilliant Blu-ray disc. Despite this slight criticism, it is still worth getting as it is such a beautiful Hollywood Classic film and will give you endless hours of pleasure and now it has been added to another of my Fred Astaire Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!
