8129768,5,B000GAKJK0,"Even though the Cosby Show is around 20 years old, it's still one of the best sit-coms ever. Bill Cosby is hilarious - a comic genius. His reactions to events are so spontaneous and creative. I haven't seen another comic quite like him. Best of all, the show's plots are both family-friendly and funny. Unlike modern sit-coms, the characters don't curse and talk about sex every other scene. Rather the episodes are centered around family dramas that are realistic but always resolved well. The cast includes everybody from Phylicia Rashad as the tough and very intelligent Mrs. Huxtable, to the young and adorable Rudy. This makes the show accessible to a wide range of audiences. I am glad these finally came out on DVD. I hope one day to share this treasure with my children.",1263168000,,778,4.770370370370371
