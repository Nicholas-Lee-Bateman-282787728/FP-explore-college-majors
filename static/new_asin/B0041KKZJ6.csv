Fast Forward 4 months - Now it will be available as a stand alone DVD or Blu-ray format.

But to show the true appreciation to those who supported Bruce and bought the original box set when it came out, they've seen fit to include additional material NOT included in Box set.

In order to get these additional features, I'm expected to buy the stand alone release as well. I can't help but feel like I'm being taken for a ride.",1299801600,51,1156,6.74496644295302
4243971,4,B0041KKZJ6,"I don't usually like documentaries - I prefer to listen to the music than hear a lot of waffle by artists who, despite their musical talent, rarely have much to say for themselves. This documentary, however, was a fascinating insight into the nuances, frustration and complexities of attempting to capture ideas, moods, feelings as expressed through music, but more particularly with Bruce Springsteen's almost Mozartian obsession with his music to the exclusion of everything else. His genius as a composer is clearly seen here, with words, ideas and music flowing from him with amazing fluidity.
While some disagreements arose between Bruce, the band, the engineer, the producer (and anyone else who cared to come by) throughout their long year in the studio, I'm just amazed that there wasn't a total walkout - or fist-fights! Over 70 songs were written, recorded and mixed, and most of them were then discarded and forgotten (until 2010, with the release of ""The Promise""). Some of the songs were recorded with many different arrangements and/or alternative lyrics; Bruce got hung up for hours or even days about the drum sound, the lyrics, the vibe, the mood; those around him were left with the difficult task of interpreting his concerns. When discussing how a particular song should be mixed, he offered this explanation: ""imagine two lovers, then a dead body drops down beside them; that's what this song should be, the dead body on the album.""
The resulting album, of course,(and his later work) suggest that his modus operandi works.",1296345600,,1544,5.082677165354331
4243972,4,B0041KKZJ6,"Well, you don't really have to watch this little history lesson to understand what to expect.  It's a history of the time period in which Bruce's classic Darkness on the Edge of Town was recorded.

About half of it focuses on recent interviews with the members of the E. Street Band, and the other half shows the events (in black and white) that took place back in the mid to late 70's when this album was recorded, which means you will mostly be treated to witnessing Bruce and the rest of his band in the recording studio laying down lyrics, going over arrangements several times, Bruce fine tuning his guitar, constant disputes between the band members, etc.

There's nothing really unordinary or especially noteworthy about this documentary, and it pretty much explains everything you've already known if you're well familiar with the Darkness album, but it's nice watching a documentary like this to possibly appreciate this great album even more than you already do.

Then again, if you dislike the Darkness album or Springsteen himself, don't expect to be blown away by anything here either.  The best it would be able to accomplish at this point would be to allow you to *maybe* appreciate Darkness on the Edge of Town and give it another shot.

However, this is the kind of history mostly intended for those who are big fans of the album.  Enjoy it (the album and the documentary).  It's good.",1286841600,2,1402,4.764462809917355
4243973,1,B0041KKZJ6,I too forked out the $100 + bucks for the lavish box set when it came out.  Now Bruce / Columbia gonna try and squeeze another $15-$20 out of me so I can get 5 songs not in the original box?  Come on BRUCE ... WTH ...,1308441600,9,217,3.595744680851064
4243974,5,B0041KKZJ6,"I was actually emotional during my viewing of this great film.  To be able to witness the philosophy expressed  and the working process exhibited by Springsteen and the E Street Band was just wonderful....I think it showed Springsteen to be far more than just the lead guitar player, singer, and writer from a Jersey Shore Bar Band.......he is a true poet in his genre approaching that of another poet of his generation, Bob Dylan.......

Get this movie....watch it from start to finish and see if you don't agree.....",1307404800,5,518,4.863636363636363
4243975,3,B0041KKZJ6,"I thought these ""making of the album"" television specials belonged on the V.H. 1 channel.  I also thought they were reserved for a watershed title, for example, John Lennon's JOHN LENNON/PLASTIC ONO BAND.  Yet it is H.B.O., television's premiere network, that gives us THE PROMISE: THE MAKING OF DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, documenting the 1979 Bruce Springsteen album DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN.  That's right, this film is not about BORN TO RUN or BORN IN THE U.S.A., the jewels of Springsteen's career.  It's about DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, perhaps not even the third or fourth biggest L.P. in the singer-songwriter's catalog!  THE RIVER and TUNNEL OF LOVE were more successful, weren't they?

Maybe that's the point of THE PROMISE: THE MAKING OF DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN.  Despite it being an era when recording artists released an album a year, for ethical reasons Bruce Springsteen postpones following up on his 1975 breakthrough BORN TO RUN for more than three years, the overdue work being DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN.  But starting with that un-catchy title, the DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN album proves more a watershed career moment for Bruce Springsteen than a bubblegum smash that gets teenyboppers dancing at the sock hop, THE PROMISE shows us.  DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN is what Springsteen the artist has to make, a result of his past success and a stepping stone to the greatest commercial achievements he would have in the 1980s with THE RIVER, BORN IN THE U.S.A., and TUNNEL OF LOVE.

If it sounds as though I'm knocking the DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN album please know if it is possible to rate art, DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN is my favorite of the ten or so Bruce Springsteen titles I own.

4243976,5,B0041KKZJ6,"Like the bulk of music fans from my generation, my first impression of Bruce Springsteen was established when I was young, back when Bruce was doing the Born in the USA thing. He'd stick his underbite way out, wear skin tight jeans and headbands, stomp around on stage riffing like he was in a hair band, ride those cheesy synthlines, etc. Needless to say, I wrote the guy off before I was in high school and even figured him for some sort of idiot savant. By the time I was 20 or so I was a fan of his music, surely; but not until I saw director Thom Zimny's The Promise: The Making of the Darkness on the Edge of Town did I realize that, in his day, Bruce was as cool as anyone, and an all-around brilliant man of deep artistry.

The bulk of Zimny's film is comprised of archival footage of Bruce and The E Street Band following the worldwide success of their previous album, Born to Run. Overnight, it seemed, Bruce had become a household name. His working class background forever lingering, Bruce saw the opportunity to make something that was not just better than Born to Run, but different. Next came the notebooks, then the songs, then the rehearsals, then the recording. Then more recording. Then more writing. Eventually Bruce and his band had 70+ new songs to choose from, 10 of which ended up on his now-classic Darkness record. Thanks for Zimny's film, we get to see the whole process, mixed up with recent footage of the band reflecting on the Darkness era.

The Promise is one of the 10 best music docs I've ever seen, telling a great story that focuses on a great - and brilliant - leading man. The movie reminds me quite a bit of Sam Jones' film about Wilco, I Am Trying to Break Your Heart, but with a much cooler focus and much cheesier production. Had the producers and director done a better job of mixing the old footage with the new (and not used every cliche doc trick in the book), this would've been a near-perfect movie. Still, though, it's a must-see for fans of rock n' roll, pop culture, songwriting or film in general.

The movie is an amazing document of a brilliant writer, music mind, band leader and thinker who was working in his artistic prime. I still can't say much for the pop star 80s version of Bruce, but damn if the struggling back alley artist of the 70s wasn't as good as they came. This film will stand as the one of the essential pieces to the Art of Bruce.

4243977,2,B0041KKZJ6,"had Bruce released all 11 of the songs from the show instead of just 5, this would have been a more worthy re-release.",1304553600,12,118,4.173913043478261
4243978,5,B0041KKZJ6,"The Promise: The Making Of Darkness On The Edge Of Town was originally included as part of the Darkness On The Edge Of Town deluxe edition that was released in November '10.  If you bought that set, then there is no need to pick up this dvd.  But if you didn't plunk down the $100. for that superb set or don't have HBO (where this film also aired), then this dvd is a nice alternative.  The film itself is first rate.  It takes you right into the recording studio and you get a real feel and of how the Darkness album was made.  It shows the all the frustration and pressure the band felt trying to follow-up the Born To Run album.  Mr. Springsteen expresses his concerns about being a one-hit wonder at the time and trying to produce an album with substance and grit. There is also some rehearsal footage showing a shirtless Mr. Springsteen with a mountain of hair that is quite striking compared to his other public personas.  This film does everything it should, show you the creative process of making an album, talk to all the key participants (band members, engineer Jimmy Iovine, etc.) and give you insight into the artists thoughts and moods.",1304467200,24,1151,4.5048076923076925
4243979,1,B0041KKZJ6,"I too pre-ordered the box set last fall and can't believe that this extra material is on this disc but not the original.  Given what we paid, IT JUST AIN""T RIGHT.  I watched Bound for Glory, the Woodie Guthrie movie last week.  Wonder what Woodie would be saying to Bruce about this.",1303862400,14,283,4.403846153846154
4243980,4,B0041KKZJ6,"This release is not for the die-hard fans, rather it is for those who couldn't afford or didn't see the need for a full-blown Darkness experience.  Those who are calling it a ""double-dip"" are not seeing this for what it is: a solo release of the documentary.

As for the content itself, the documentary is excellent and very much worth repeated viewings.  It is so much more than just a documentary on the creation of the album.  Rather it is about an artist who is trying to find his voice and staying true to his vision while dealing with enormous outside pressures.  Both the audio/video of the footage (new and archival) is beautifully presented in a very new and creative way.  I have to give my hats off to Thom Zimny for this excellent work, a worthy documentary on one of the most important albums in the Springsteen catalogue.

The extra ""performance"" videos are okay, but  not a ""must have"" by any stretch of the word.  The band offers some good performances, but nothing coming close to ""you gotta see this!"" status.  As for the ""Talking To Fans"" video, it is nothing more than a 23 minute commercial for the documentary.  Bruce answers a few questions, but they are short and interspersed with long stretches of video from the documentary.  I saw it once, and that was more than enough; nothing that I would spend my money on to have a permanent copy.  Had they included the unedited talk with the fans, I might have considered this a likely purchase, but I don't see the need to own a commercial of a product I already own.

While it would have been nice to have another '78 concert or (even better!) the Darkness album as uncompressed audio files, any addition of that nature would have created a huge ""What the...?"" from the fans who would have complained bitterly that they were not included in the box set.  Again, this release is about the documentary with some ""filler"", not an extension of the Darkness Box Set.

So, I would also give this release a pass unless you (a) don't have the documentary or (b) are a frantic collector.",1303776000,9,2048,4.554644808743169
4243981,1,B0041KKZJ6,"Once again Bruce Inc see fit to rip off fans. Why could they have not released the complete Carousel show and maybe another '78 show and then added the Darkness doc as a 'bonus'. No, instead they release the doc again with a few extra tiny morsels and expect fans to buy it.  Sorry, but this fan is fed up with having to buy these rip off releases and will be sticking with the bootleg(s).",1303171200,21,389,4.1866666666666665

8412908,5,B0041KKZJ6,"Full of rare footage I've never seen before, like Bruce & Steven V. going at Sherry Darling almost like a joke... Steven and him are just goofing around, he's seriously just trying the song out on a bed mattress, in the song's infancy the two of them just playing like a couple of kids... Unbelievable footage, so glad to own this. I have the making of Born To Run, another must have.... I honestly didn't think there would be another indispensable Bruce documentary quite like that one, ever, but there is, and THIS is it! The reason is that it showcases the lull & and emotional turmoil between '75's release of Born to Run, during the legal situation between Bruce & Mike Appel, .. And how that, in & of itself, inspired Bruce for all the songs in the Darkness album.... It also gives a deeper insight into just how many would-be pop hits Bruce could have had IF he would have sold out to less then his genius abilities.... And how all his ""throw out"" songs during the time of the making of this album were actually pure genius works, that other artists were able to capitalize on (ie Patti Smith, Because The Night)... He gave that song up because he didn't feel he wasn't personally in that particular spot in his life, despite it's amazing artistic integrity.... Further showcasing how personal his music is to him and that everything you hear from him is truly from his heart and autobiographical. Especially proud to be a Bruce fan after seeing this!",1389398400,,1458,4.568702290076335
8412909,5,B0041KKZJ6,"Given the fact that there are hours, weeks, of raw footage of Bruce and the E. Street Band in 1978 at the height of their sonic powers, recording outtakes and demos and alt versions of songs that later fought it out to be the Last Men Standing in the Darkness on the Edge of Town LP, I just wanted the sometimes grainy but always atmospheric and rousing and full-sounding rehearsal tapes to just play and play and play.  Instead, a few intriguing bars of a rare song get cut to a talking gray-head (sorry) enthusing about how great they were back-when, or a loose studio moment of catty bickering gets squelched in favor of another old-head reassuring us, ""We survived.""  No duh.  But couldn't we have gotten to savor that precious rock n roll edge a bit more fully?  After all, as fans, we know the band survived and then some.  What would have been cooler was to hear and see that survival meaning business, taking shape, if nothing else for the revelation which was easy to miss at the time but which became clearer with The River and Nebraska, that the Boss was not just a caricature of heartland blue collar blues, but something like the next great U.S. short story writer since Ray Carver.  That was Bruce's great genius - to come off like he's rewriting Rodgers and Hammerstein with his own fair share of bombast kept intact, but doing it the way Carver might have.",1388016000,2,1372,4.512096774193548
8412910,5,B0041KKZJ6,Utterly compelling video of Bruce trying to finish recording Darkness at the End of Town.  You don't have to look too closely to see exactly why Elvis and Michael Jackson ended up the way they did.  Everyone around Bruce is there to serve his music and that is understandable but the truly dark side of this is that the people around him need to maintain their place in his life to maintain their place in rock and roll so they allow him the freedom to self-destruct. There is at least one scene in which Bruce displays textbook mania. Springsteen is right to be glad he's still alive. I'm glad too!,1367539200,,599,4.4363636363636365
8412911,5,B0041KKZJ6,Very well done documentary of a fascinating and creative period for Springsteen. Great interviews and old footage to help tell the story.,1354838400,,137,5.2727272727272725
8412912,1,B0041KKZJ6,"Like many others here, I purchased the box set, now I find out there is a (really extraordinary) performance of some of the songs from ""The Promise"" included on the standalone disc that ARE NOT included with the box set. So, after we spend 100 bucks on the box set, we have to ALSO buy the standalone? This is complete BS, and unfortunately, Bruce (or his label or whoever) has pulled this previously as well (you buy Wrecking Ball on vinyl, you don't get bonus tracks, you buy ""Seeger Sessions,"" then a few months later another version comes out with a DVD and bonus tracks). This just ain't the right way to treat the fans.",1354406400,4,625,4.443478260869565
8412913,1,B0041KKZJ6,"Having had the ""Darkness Sessions"" for many years, I looked forward to the releases but have been disappointed.

Some of the songs have been ""updated"", sadly losing the freshness and rawness that was felt in the originals, but it is the DVD that is difficult to watch.

It is fascinating to see young Springsteen, heavy jersey-accent devil-may-care, making the finest music of the day, but flash-foward to the older, southern-twang philosopher is painful to watch.

Each emotion expressed by him is analyzed by him, as if the universe turned on his every whim.  He does self-analysis, sometimes acting like a therapist to a therapist, in a blatant narcissistic display on camera.

One interesting moment is when the older Springsteen is speaking about his former manager, Mike Appel, when suddenly, he drops his southern drawl and anger flashes his eyes, and the pace of speech picks up, Jersey accent and all, unable to conceal the anger.  It was an honest moment caught among too many dishonest ones.

Older fans; that is, those who were in their teens in the late 70's, will understand.  1978 wasn't a great year for music and Springsteen stood head and shoulders above the rest.  New Jerseans were proud of him, and not embarrassed by his regional accent.  The older, political egomaniac who appears to have so lost touch with reality, tries in vain to be Bob Dylan trying to be Woody Guthrie, when we were happy with him being Bruce Springsteen.  We didn't need political sermons back then, and the music, as it was then, was perfect.  Listening to the modern additions, including new guitar and vocals, reminds me of how much more valuable the originals are.

Interviews with E Street Band members is interesting, but the close ups of modern Springsteen are painful to watch, especially in his self-analytical moments which dominate the DVD.  Pass on the DVD and find the Darkness Outtakes as a representative of some really great music.",1317254400,10,1943,4.920245398773006
8412914,4,B0041KKZJ6,"Well, the actual film with the old footage of the making of the record and Bruce's interview was 5 stars. It was an intriguing and amazing look into this moment in time of a deeply insightful poet and songwriter's spiritual journey. But I took off a star for the ""bonus feature"", which was profoundly disappointing. This DVD would have been perfect if they had included the concert from 1978 or '79. They they only show brief clips of it, and I would have much rather watched that than a new concert in Asbury Park. The youthful energy of the history of the record is lost in the new concert they recorded for this DVD, which feels manufactured and insincere. Apparently you have to pay almost $100 for the whole concert. I will eventually buy it used, but after watching something all about the artistic integrity that went into making this record, it really seems an outrageous price.",1315008000,,886,4.649681528662421
8412915,5,B0041KKZJ6,"This documentary is brilliant on so many levels.  It doucments an artist who is trying to re-invent himself, under enormous pressure, while creating something new and meaningful in the process.  You can see what Bruce was up against after the success of Born to Run in 1975 and the agony of the ensuing lawsuit with a former manager over the control of his music.  Bruce is clearly a ""control freak"" and a perfectionist in the studio, but he is also obsessive and relentless when he is creating the sound that he hears in his head.  The E Street Band members are loyal to their boss in spite of the new direction he is taking them in an attempt to not repeat himself.  Darkness On the Edge of Town is my favorite album by Bruce, and the 1978 tour is one of the greatest in the history of rock music.  The ""fly on the wall"" perspective of seeing Bruce in the studio gives you a whole new appreciation for his creative process, his craft, and his incedible work ethic.  While many of Bruce's peers were making disco records or snorting cocaine in 1977 and 1978, Bruce was following his muse with integrity and a rock and roll passion that cannot be faked.  If you are not a fan of Bruce's music or concerts, and there must be something wrong with you if this is the case, then you can discover through this documentary what the rest of us see and hear in the man.
