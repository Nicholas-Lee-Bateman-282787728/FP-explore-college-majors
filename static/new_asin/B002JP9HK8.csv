8371562,5,B002JP9HK8,I really loved this performance and recital repertoire. Mr Hampson is a very intelligent singer and in this performance led us to a trance like existence in the world of Schumann that makes musical experiences such as this so beautiful and spiritual. Mr. Wolfram Rieger was the consummate companion for this journey with his sensitive and stirring accompaniment.  I am grateful for having experienced this performance. As the voice shouted out at the end - BRAVO! This is recital at its best.,1419811200,,492,5.0
8371563,2,B002JP9HK8,"I found this to be a bit odd, and frankly I believe Schumann knew what he was doing when he published the final version of this, his greatest song cycle. Why dredge up what he discarded?",1386547200,,186,4.194444444444445
8371564,5,B002JP9HK8,"I can't say that I found the academic ""discoveries"" (the earlier versions of the Dichterliebe songs) such a revelation.  Indeed, the earlier drafts of the Dichterliebe seem sometimes melodically slightly less rich than the later one (repeated notes rather than some of the little jumps that accompanied the emotional highs and lows of the more developed, published songs).  But this is an excellent recital that features superb rapport between singer and pianist.  Even a moment of apparent partner disorientation in the last song feels a product of the trancelike intensity both musicians achieve-- and thus it almost enhances the experience.

This is transcendent music and should be part of everyone's library.",1339113600,2,713,5.396396396396397
8371565,1,B002JP9HK8,"Thomas Hampson is about 10 times better then what this DVD demonstrats. It is a cold, one man show in a very stiff setting. Thomas Hampson shows very little emotion or personality in the DVD which is indeed what the man has when he is ""let loose"" to put his soul and emotion into his beautiful voice. Skip this one unless you are into bordom. Sorry Tom.",1302998400,,353,4.2835820895522385
8371566,5,B002JP9HK8,"Absolute beauty as interpretation, delicacy and technic. Strongly recommended to who love the great interpretations of Romantic Lieders but still are limited to consider that genius is gravitating on Franz Schubert masterpieces only.
Fritz Wunderlich and Dietrisch-Fischer Dieskau recorded worderful performances of Schuman Lieders, but Thomas Hampson is also magnificent in this performance greatly accompanied by excellent pianist Wolfram Rieger.

8371567,5,B002JP9HK8,"This DVD is drawn from performances taped in the Prinzregentheater in December of 2007 and is valuable in that the edition of the Dichterliebe which hasn't been recorded before and is based on Hampson's own research. There are four songs that were dropped ostensibly by Schumann; although they have been sung elsewhere they have not been included in any of the many recordings of the great cycle. All of this would be academic if the performances were ordinary which is hardly possible with this artist who is at his peak vocally and artistically. Indeed it is extraordinary that Hampson has been singing a number of roles (Doktor Faust, Mandryka, Simon Boccanegra and Macbeth) that lyric baritones ordinarily don't sing. Like Fischer Dieskau he is able to surmount the difficulties inherent in these more dramatic roles without any damage to the voice. His utter control over the dynamics, the smooth emmision of tone, the legato are peerless and at the service of these lieder.

The Kerner lieder are less well known although there have been a number of recordings over the years; the notes accompanying the DVD indicate that the poetry of Justinius Kerner is mediocre. I make no pretentions to being a scholar and am not knowledgable in the German language. Even so, many of the songs are quite beautiful and reward the listener who is willing to indulge in repeated listenings/viewings.

Highly recommended to lieder lovers and those who enjoy great singing.

Medici Arts is probably not the only company which has released lieder recitals, but they have gone into the archives and rewarded us with performances which probably haven't been seen since they were shown on TV in Europe. More surely exists and one can only hope that sales of this kind of product will encourage them to continue this endeavor.",1259712000,5,1810,4.966996699669967
8371568,5,B002JP9HK8,"When in Berlin Thomas Hampson thought he would look in the Staatsbibliothek at the manuscript for Schumann's Dichterliebe, a song-cycle he'd been singing for years, he discovered that there is no manuscript of the cycle as we've come to know it. Indeed, what he found was the composer's original version (called, in the manuscript, 'Zwanzig Lieder und Gesnge aus dem ""Lyrischen Intermezzo"" im ""Buch der Lieder"" [Heinrich Heine]') which, it turns out, is very different from the published, familiar version. First, there are twenty songs in the original, not sixteen, and there are some significant differences in some of the sixteen that have come down to us. Thus, when Hampson came to sing a recital in Munich in 2007 he decided to sing the original version. This is its first recording.

The four additional songs are 'Dein Angesicht' ('Your face') and 'Lehn deine Wang' ' ('Lean your face') which are placed between songs 4 & 5 ('Wenn ich in deine Augen seh' & 'Ich will meine Seele tauchen'), and 'Es leuchtet meine Liebe' ('My love shines') and 'Mein Wagen rollet langsam' ('My wagon rolls slowly') placed between songs 12 & 13 ('Am leuchtenden Sommermorgen' and 'Ich hab' im Traum geweinet'). It is not known why they were not included in the published version. They are certainly of a piece both poetically and musically with the rest of the cycle.  They have been recorded separately by such singers a Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, but not as part of the Dichterliebe cycle.

The rest of the DVD, which is taken from two performances at Munich's Prinzregententheater on December 18 & 20, 2007, includes Schumann's 'Zwlf Gedichte' ('Twelve Poems'), texts by Justinus Kerner. Hampson, who is surely one of our very best lieder singers, is in marvelous voice and, of course, his diction and expression are all one could ask. His sensitive accompanist is the distinguished pianist Wolfram Rieger.

Both video and audio are superb. The camera mostly remains on the singer, with very little zooming around as is sometimes the case when directors want to make the picture 'more interesting.' Audio is clear and lifelike with singer and piano in optimum balance. No texts are provided.

For admirers of Thomas Hampson this is a no-brainer. And for those who are interested to hear the original version of 'Dichterliebe' the same holds true.

A strong recommendation.
