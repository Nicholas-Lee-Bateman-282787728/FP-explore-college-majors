1397663,4,B000056HT0,"This is truly one of Jimmy Wang's best performance using weaponery.  Definately a classical ending to be remembered.  I too was torn on a 3 or 4 star, it was the ending which really impressed me.",1147305600,,195,4.388888888888889
1397664,3,B000056HT0,"The main gimmick is that the main character uses a silver spear; to stab, poke and slash with great aplomb.

Most of the grainy film is pretty boring and it has been directly transferred to DVD with no clean up, BUT there are some good fight scenes to be found here. Fast forward to the last 20 minutes of the film, lots of bloody action.",1129852800,,338,4.2
1397665,4,B000056HT0,"I was torn between a 3 and 4 star on this film (It is worth noting that I have the Platinum version rather than this version- so I will not speak of DVD quality).  Ultimately the ending convinced me of the need for a 4 star review.  The final 20 minutes are the sort of stand off you expect from a classic picture. Unfortunately, the build up could've used a bit of comic relief and/or more character development of the general.  Well now I am getting technical for an otherwise entertaining movie.  No one can strike a pose like Wang Yu!  See more great selections at ""Kung Fu for the Sole"" Listmania.",1123459200,4,602,4.339285714285714
1397666,3,B000056HT0,"A MAN NAMED THE WHITE DRAGON MUST FIGHT TO SAVE HIS COUNTRY FROM TYRANNICAL RULE. GOOD FIGHTS BUT THIN STORY. IT'S A GOOD MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE OVERALL. YOU SHOULD ENJOY IT. THAT DUBBING IS HILLARIOUS, THOUGH.",1104710400,2,206,4.75
1397667,5,B000056HT0,"This movie offers a great sense of character and storyline realism in the way it was filmed.  Everything: the casting, the fight scenes, the plot, the original musical score--even the dubbing--comes together quite well in this movie.

Wang Yu portrays a lone fighter, ""the White Dragon,"" who expertly wields a silver spear and gives allegience to no one.  However, his fateful involvement with a young boy and pretty inn keeper place him on a true hero's path of interior change and even transcendence, through the situations he finds himself in while helping these two.

In addition to the merits of the film itself, for the price,... it is easily one of the best bargains among the many martial arts films I have purchased.  The video transfer on my Platinum Video version of the DVD is a bit soft, but still acceptable.  The video transfer on the Diamond Entertainment Release is superior, but the audio inferior, to the Platinum disc.

Top shelf all the way!  Blood of the Dragon rightfully deserves to be on the ""top ten"" list of many a serious subscriber to this movie genre.",1043971200,7,1081,4.774193548387097
1397668,3,B000056HT0,"I must've been about seven years old when I first saw this chinese cult film. Starring Wang Yu as a spaghetti westernesque Clint Eastwood in the role of the ""White Dragon"", this film is sure to please as far as entertainment goes!
A young boy named Nichu stumbles upon a dying man who is a true patriot. The man asks, as a dying wish, that the boy give a bamboo tube (containing a list of names) to the young prince of the palace. When Nichu returns to the inn with the bamboo tube, he explains to Miss Yen, his guardian, that he must deliver the tube to the prince. But before he gets a chance, two guards enter from the Mongolians who demand the tube be given over. The White Dragon intervenes and saves Nichu from the guards' violent wrath. After Nichu explains his entrusted promise from the dying man to White Dragon, they both go on forward to deliver the tube. Unfortunately so, a man only known as the ""Red Dragon"" is leading his men of the Mongolians to find the list...and destroy all who oppose their oppression.
Quite a great film for it's small budget, including an awesome ending clash of blood and swords! I would recommend this great cult classic to those with a taste of old style chinese sword fighting. Truly a cool experience! 3 & 1/2 stars!",1043366400,4,1261,4.439655172413793
1397669,5,B000056HT0,"This is a great movie. With an easy story line to follow. Great martial arts action. (Wang Yu)is truly the master of the silver spear. The fighting scenes are unbelievable, you too will enjoy this movie. The only disappointing thing to me about this DVD. Not in (WIDESCREEN)...",1025654400,3,277,4.791666666666667
1397670,4,B000056HT0,"I am an avid fan of martial arts films, and trust me I've seen some bad ones, so I was saddend to come across such a bad review for such a good film. Yes the sound effects are bit hammy but that adds to the film. Unlike a lot of old martial arts films the story line makes sense, the fight seens are good and the magic weapons are fantastic. The characters are played excelently, and I have to say that the boy in the film is instramentle to one of the best ending fight seens ever, that alone deserves more than one star. I suggest if the matrix is what you call a good kung fu movie or your searching for a crouching tiger... then don't look here.  If you loved 'the killer meteor' get this film and remeber... ""Ma Chin, the spell of your magic sword has been broken -- by me!""",996105600,,779,4.058441558441558
1397671,5,B000056HT0,"This movie rates among the ten best kung fu movies of all time.  The movie starts with a duel and from there, it is a continues action all the way to the end.  The movie ends with the white dragon taking on an army all by himself.  It is one of the most dynamic ending that I have ever seen.  I will recomend this movie to anyone who is a martial arts fan.  It would be worth purchasing this movie though the quality is very poor it will make up with the reasonable price",986342400,8,471,3.9680851063829787

1397676,4,B000056HT0,"While most will list names like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan or Jet Li as their favorite martial arts film star, I'd have to go a little further back in time and throw my name in the Jimmy Wang Yu basket. A controversial figure in Hong Kong, Yu managed to amass an impressive filmography before his star waned under the pressure of his larger than life personal dramas and other young, more accomplished stars eating up the box-office slots.

Nevertheless, Yu remains my favorite thanks to early viewings of ""Master of the Flying Guillotine"", which many consider his masterpiece. Yu became a well-regarded as an actor, produced and director thanks to that film, and I hazard to say anything tops it. ""Blood of the Dragon"" is an admirable credit on his resume, though.

The story features Yu as White Dragon who ends up fighting a horde of mercenaries in a tavern in hopes that a scroll inscribed with the names of a rebellion will successfully stay out of the hands of an tyrannical emperor. It may not be high art, but this movie succeeds on a simple premise that effectively sets up every character, gives them a proper motivation, and allows for numerous extravagant fight scenes. Yu was the original king of the 1 vs. 100 battle royal, and the climatic--seemingly futile--battle here is awesome to behold! There are also several little touches that make the first act great; Yu can knock teeth out by spitting walnuts, for instance, and a young lord has a sword with slight mystical powers.

This isn't my favorite kung fu movie, yet it holds up well to repeated viewings unlike many of the Shaw brothers films or even a number of Chan films. I will give a caveat that this disc by platinum isn't good at all; the film is grainy, muffled and washed out as well as shown in the wrong aspect ratio. That being said, if you are a hardened fan of this sort of film, this DVD is much better than a Beverly Wilshire or Alpha Video disc.",1412467200,2,1928,4.566473988439307

7932071,5,B000056HT0,"I've seen many of Wang Yu's films, and I think that ""Blood of the Dragon"" (aka ""The Desperate Chase"") released in 1971 just might be his finest moment. It's certainly one of the only independent films he made that can hold its own against Chang Cheh-directed epics like ""The Magnificent Trio"" and ""The Assassin"" in terms of excitement and tragic scope. The fights (very little empty-hand action, but plenty of spears, swords and more exotic weapons) are well-choreographed, the tone of the movie is appropriately grim, and Wang's character Lung Tai is a hero you actually care about and root for. The dubbing is slightly better than what I've heard in most Hong Kong and Taiwanese martial arts flicks, and the hard-rocking American soundtrack--recorded by Flood--enhances the action. ""One man, one weapon, one hell of a movie""...that's what ""Blood of the Dragon"" promises, and it delivers! (Especially in the no-holds-barred climax.)",1525651200,,933,5.185430463576159
