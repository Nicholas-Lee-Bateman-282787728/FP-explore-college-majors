8726385,5,B012OTHHM8,Arrived on time an din good condition.  Grandchildren enjoyed this movie very much.  Great story and wonderful scenery and animation.  Would highly recommend this movie for young ones and adults.,1476144000,,195,5.433333333333334
8726386,5,B012OTHHM8,with the possible exception of the last episode on the DVD  you will find all the stories of this DVD revolving around Tinkerbell if her image on the cover was not already a clue on that.  I really like the lost kids characters in this series and how the mermaids are darker and more dangerous that in other versions of Peter Pan.  remind me a little of the mermaids from the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean movie in my opinion.  I also like how in one episode has Wendy talking to grandma Wendy  on her lap top and the references to her knowledge of Peter and Neverland made in the episode.  Makes one wonder if Wendy mother knows more about what her kids have been up to than she lets on.,1460073600,,690,4.229007633587786
8726387,5,B012OTHHM8,"This a modern version. You will see things like a laptop,digital camera, Windy using a social network. I excused it for being with the times.",1456704000,,141,4.68
8726388,3,B012OTHHM8,"Gotta say, this wasn't at all what I was expecting, a modern day Wendy, Micheal and John venturing off to Neverland daily, it's worth a watch, but I'd think on purchasing this series.",1447200000,2,183,4.575757575757576
8726389,4,B012OTHHM8,"I had never even heard of DQ Entertainment before coming across a trailer for this TV series on line along with some show clips.  While I was disappointed that neither any mermaid lagoon episodes or the episode from the on line clips showing Peter and Tinkerbell meeting the 21st century Wendy John and Micheal was not on the DVD the series itself is well worth checking out.  Every night after the moon comes up Tinkerbell and Peter shows up at Wendy's house to take her and her brothers to Neverland without her mother  ever being aware of their comings or goings.  To add to the new 21st century feel  instead of Lost boys we have the lost kids.  Both boys and girls who join Peter against Captain Hook's crew  in adventures such as John's stolen treasure, visit to a golden pyramid and much more.",1446768000,3,800,4.513888888888889
