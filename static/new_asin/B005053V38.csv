8450681,4,B005053V38,"I really love the ""15 Minute Results"" yoga DVD but the ""Cardio Burn"" DVD leaves some room for improvement. The instructor talks too much and the pace and flow of the workout is hard to get into, so that you end up checking the TV when you should be going through the workout motions in some kind of rhythm. But the workout is alright, despite it's nonsensical process, and the 15 Minute Results DVD is great.",1385683200,,408,4.381578947368421
