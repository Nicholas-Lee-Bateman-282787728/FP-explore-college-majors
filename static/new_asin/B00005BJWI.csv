7937940,2,B00005BJWI,"These are a collection of the handful of WC Fields shorts, all of which are actually public domain at this points, so rather than buying, you should go to the archive.org and stream/download.

You should really just save some cash and buy the collections.  Sure, they're 40 bucks, but you get almost every WC Fields movie.",1292457600,6,322,4.732142857142857
7937941,3,B00005BJWI,"This is a bargain basement edition version of W.C. Fields' shorts. The production is cheap and the extras are non-existent. If you're on a budget and want to see where W.C. Fields was before such classics as ""Its A Gift"" and ""The Bank Dick,"" then this is a reasonable investment. But the film quality isn't good, and some of the prints cut off Fields head in ""The Golf Specialist""(I""m guessing that those shots didn't mean to cut off his head, but I could be wrong).

I bought this not expecting much, and that's what I got. If you want W.C. Fields' humor it's here, but don't expect a quality transfer or any extras with the shorts.",1252108800,3,633,4.456896551724138
7937942,2,B00005BJWI,Was disappointed by the quality of this item. In fact the worst I've ever bought. Oh well...,1220140800,10,92,4.470588235294118
7937943,1,B00005BJWI,"This DVD, ""The Best of W.C. Fields"" is an insult to the man and his fans alike.  There is no excuse for the awful sound and poor picture quality.  The intrusive loud hum on the soundtrack makes it impossible to enjoy these classic Fields shorts.  The company that released this DVD is called ""Platinum"".  ""Lead"" would be more appropriate.  The fancy packaging notwithstanding, this DVD has the hallmarks of a bootleg product.  Buyers beware of knock-off products that take advantage of your love of the classics.  Do your research and, by all means, read reviews at Amazon.",1220054400,23,573,4.845360824742268
7937944,1,B00005BJWI,"First the big if:  on my disc The best of W.C.Field including golf specialist, dentist and fatal glass of beer is not from PLATINUM  collection but from DIGITAL GOLD COLLECTION. May be all the same.

On the cover states in three big banners: Digitally remastered, digital 5.1. surround soundtrack dolby digital sound.

All you hear is some far away voices and an irritating low fuzz all the time. The quality of the movietransfer is as poor.

As we say in Holland: Buying Cheap is buying expensive!",1151625600,40,498,4.744186046511628
