He was destined to greatness and martyrdom for the cause of independence in India. Yet we know so little about this Punjabi youth leader who quickly became a national leader. The movie was inspirational and well acted. It brought tears to the eyes as you watched their devotion to the cause of freeing India from colonialism and it made one think of the conditions that still persist there.
This is a must watch movie.",1498262400,,542,4.776595744680851

It's hard to find a single flaw throughout the film as the whole cast and crew join hands to give a stunning presentation of the events that took place in 1928 British-India. Ajay Devgan is absolutely brilliant, he gives a performance of a lifetime! Devgan effortlessly gets in the shoes of the legendary patriotic hero and takes us on a ride through history. An excellent performance from almost the whole cast and above all Sushant Singh who gives his very best as 'Sukhdev'. Top notch performances along with a beautiful score is not all you will get, there is much more here that makes the film much more than just a biographical epic.

In the list of top Biography epics like 'Joan of Arc - The Messenger', 'Queen Margot' and many more, 'The Legend of Bhagat Singh' definitely hits the list as well. It's a true masterpiece.",1327363200,,988,4.710982658959537

Background/Synopsis: Bhagat Singh was an ardent follower of Gandhi in his youth but as he grew and witnessed the continued harsh treatment of his people at the hands of the occupying British he turned his back on the philosophy of passive resistance. This film tells the story of his transformation from his early pro Gandhi years to his defiance of British rule by meeting violence with more violence. His popularity eventually rivaled that of Gandhi and many would make the argument that if not for Bhagat Singh the British may never have embraced Gandhi's demands for fear of the alternative embodied in Bhagat Singh.

Critique: Some movies entertain, some inform. If one film succeeds in doing both than it is unquestionably a very good film. Sometimes a film rises to even greater heights by fusing the medium and the message in such a way as to give birth to an even higher art form. What is that special something I speak of? It's inspiration.

The 2002 release `The Legend of Bhagat Singh' starring Ajay Devjan as the revolutionary Indian freedom fighter and martyr is truly an inspirational work bringing to life tumultuous times in the history of India and providing the audience with an iconic, unforgettable portrait of a man of great conviction and courage. The film excels on every level; excellent production values, superb acting, well conceived story development and memorable soundtrack. However even with all the excellence one finds in this film there is still one thing that outshines everything else, the performance of Ajay Devjan. Ajay was born to play Bhagat Singh, exuding all the emotions and interior motivatiions that defined the man and his movement; idealism, hope, love of country, determination, defiance, self sacrifice and yes, hatred of the British. I would consider this to be his signature performance, absolutely mesmerizing.

Please watch this film and after you do ask yourself one question. Why are we all familiar with the name Mahatma Gandhi but we have never heard of Bhagat Singh?",1305072000,3,2088,5.043478260869565
8442706,4,B004V2D6QS,"The Legend of Bhagat Singh is a wonderful representation of India, in the middle of its struggle to throw the British out. As with any with movie with a historical basis, I was a nervous that Bollywood would use artistic license to cheapen the story. In fact, the director, Santoshi shows in details how Bhagat came to develop his views of the British with very little outside distraction.

Ajay Devgan is excellent as a the title character, bringing the necessary passion that only he can provide with his steel-y stare. Of particular note is the scene showing the freedom fighters telling Gandhi to stop working within the British framework. Westerners can see the parallel between Gandhi's nonviolent methods and the more revolutionary Bhagat Singh with Martin Luther King's methods vs Malcolm X ""by any means necessary"" credo.

As the last reviewer mentioned, it's a great reference for those interested in India's independence struggle and it truly reinvigorated my interest in Indian history.

See this movie if you enjoy eastern history, but won't go for the traditional Bollywood flick.",1304467200,,1094,5.134831460674158
8442707,5,B004V2D6QS,"This is clearly one of my absolutely favourite films ever! It is extremely well-made and Santoshi isn't afraid of portraying history as he sees it. The film is very informative as well as exciting.

I cannot think of a single thing to say negatively about this film. It is just awesome!",1134604800,5,286,4.607843137254902
