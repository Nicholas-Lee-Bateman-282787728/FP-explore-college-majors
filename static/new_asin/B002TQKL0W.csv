3985727,5,B002TQKL0W,"I'm not too big into stand up but Aziz is one of the few comedians who can make me fall out of my seat laughing. When I first heard this DVD I was in tears, I watched it a couple more times of course and now I'm quoting it. People are starting to pick up what I'm quoting, but it takes them a second. I ramble about Harris watches Burn Notice! Such a hilarious DVD, I highly suggest you pick it up/check it out!",1263513600,,411,3.9047619047619047
3985728,4,B002TQKL0W,"I went to the taping for this show.

I'm not much of a fan of Aziz' acting, but his standup is great.

The Randy encore was my favorite part of the show.  Really over the top.",1263081600,2,175,3.8055555555555554

3985739,5,B002TQKL0W,"I thought this was hilarious.  I'm surprised by some of the lukewarm reviews.  There is a slightly nerdy element to his humor, perhaps that is why, but he is hilarious, and it is so fun to watch this fresh and unpretentious stand-up.",1426377600,,233,4.523809523809524

If you are not into stand-up you will really dislike this show. Aziz has a particular style and perhaps the funniest part is when he discusses his family. Occasional he has long skits that drag, such as one about R.Kelly and the way he sings.",1414972800,,387,4.173333333333333

3985761,5,B002TQKL0W,Aziz Ansari is so funny and this Dvd had me constantly cracking up. I will definitely buy any other standup Dvds he has. His delivery of comedy is hysterical.,1365033600,,158,4.482758620689655
3985762,5,B002TQKL0W,My boyfriend had this DVD written in a note book of wants when we first started dating that he didn't know I had seen. He was really surprised to get this. We both sat down and loved it. He showed it like every friend that steps foot in our door way ever since he got it!!,1364256000,,272,3.875
3985763,4,B002TQKL0W,"This hour long stand up special is absolutely hilarious. It's also incredibly offensive... I repeat, INCREDIBLY offensive! Therefore, if you are at all squeamish, or sensitive about particular subjects, this one is best left untouched. It also bears mentioning that you should never, EVER attempt to watch Aziz go to work while in the company of your children, or you will be thoroughly, permanently, irredeemably embarrassed. There are moments in here that simply can't be undone, once digested.

However, if you enjoy Aziz's antics and hard-R comedy, this is the gig for you. There is nobody quite like Aziz in the world of stand up. Everything about him is unique- his appearance, his material, and his delivery. He's just a delightfully weird funny man, and it's easy to see why he has become an integral part of ""Parks and Recreation"".",1360627200,3,840,5.0
3985764,1,B002TQKL0W,"I enjoy this guy on Parks and Recreation, but as a stand-up comic he is astonishingly bad.  His is the most uninspired routine I've ever seen.  Almost embarrassing.",1357689600,,164,4.821428571428571

3985766,2,B002TQKL0W,"I purchased this dvd based on the reviews but I am dissapointed with the content.  There were a few laughs but generally the jokes are about bjs and sex.  The Randy bit at the end is highly obnoxious and not at all funny.  I agree with another commenter that said Aziz comes off as nervous and not very confident.  Some of the jokes go on for too long.  Aziz substitutes profanity in places where he could have delivered an intelligent, well thought out joke.  He needs more practice and writers with a broader vocabulary.",1356480000,,522,4.5
3985767,5,B002TQKL0W,i found this pretty funny i love it my brother and i laughed at it too bad he doesnt have more,1355270400,,94,3.5238095238095237
3985788,4,B002TQKL0W,"I love this comedian! He's witty, brilliant, adorably self-depreciating, easy on the eyes, and great at giving you a laugh over the stupid (and sometimes trivial) things people do. I enjoyed this clear up until the end with the slapstick ""Randy"" bit. (I guess ""Randy"" is a character from a movie he did called ""Funny People,"" which I never saw. With the singular exception of ""Little Nicky"" Adam Sandler movies just don't appeal to me!) Other than that, and his tendency to name drop, there are a lot of laughs to be had here. His other special, the one you can only buy from his website, is better IMnsHO, but this one is definitely worth watching too. He's young so hopefully he'll grow out of the name dropping phase soon!",1343347200,,725,4.584615384615384
3985789,5,B002TQKL0W,One of the top 5 stand-up specials in the last few years.  The DVD includes several bits that are not included on the televised special.  Definitely worth including in your home collection.,1330646400,,189,4.875
3985790,5,B002TQKL0W,"Aziz Ansari is one hilarious Mo' Fo'.  I can't remember the last time I had such hard, consistent laughs throughout a stand-up comedy show.  The guy is an absolute comedy genius.  This DVD is relatively short at only 55 minutes, but it's some of the funniest stuff you'll ever see.  The guy has one of the best comedic deliveries I've seen in a decade or more.  He's starting to get a lot of popularity now and a lot of movie offers, so I don't know if he'll continue doing much stand-up, but this DVD is absolute gold.  I highly suggest it to anyone who wants a good laugh!",1330128000,2,574,4.268518518518518

3985792,4,B002TQKL0W,"I loved the bits of Aziz's stand-up I had seen on YouTube, so I thought I might go ahead and purchase the whole  DVD. I wasn't disappointed. I personally could have done without the ""Randy"" bit at the end, but that is just my opinion. Otherwise, I loved it! Definitely a great DVD to pop in when friends are over, and you want something on in the background to inspire some good stories and a lot of laughs.",1314489600,,407,4.217948717948718
3985793,5,B002TQKL0W,"Had no idea about this comedy special until I saw a clip on youtube related to one of Aziz Ansari's scenes in a film.  Netflix didn't have this on instant video, so I bought this for $10 on amazon.  I'm so happy - this special is hilarious.  If you like any of his work, you will love this special.  If you are unsure about this, do yourself a favor and give it a try.",1309046400,,368,3.9324324324324325
3985794,4,B002TQKL0W,"Funny stuff but at times his phrasing and style is so reminiscent of Mitch Hedberg that it's distracting.
Aziz Ansari's dvd special has solid material and he has a good stage presence - just wish he'd drop the Hedberg act. He doesn't need it.",1298592000,,242,4.5227272727272725

3985888,5,B002TQKL0W,This DVD is hysterical.  I saw the premier of the special on Comedy Central and loved it so much that I bought the DVD from Amazon.  The bonus feature is every bit as funny as the special on the DVD.  I highly recommend it!,1277769600,,223,4.0227272727272725
3985889,5,B002TQKL0W,"I watch a lot of standup, and this is definitely among the funniest. My boyfriend and I are CONSTANTLY quoting Aziz, and it's so easy to!

3985892,3,B002TQKL0W,"INTIMATE MOMENTS FOR A SENSUAL EVENING is a standup comedy set by Aziz Ansari filmed in July 2009 and released on DVD six months later. I knew Aziz Ansari from the great sketch comedy programme Human Giant, and I was looking forward to seeing him perform solo in a theatre. Much of this set is funny, with Ansari tapping the comedic potential of contemporary technology like Craigslist and Facebook, mocking certain celebrities who take themselves too seriously, and reporting his experiences of living in South Carolina and New York.

Unfortunately, the set is seriously undermined by Ansari's decision to perform a 10-minute encore as his character ""Randy"" from the Judd Apatow film FUNNY PEOPLE. Randy is a standup comedian whose humour is exceedingly coarse, consisting only of sexual and scatological references. No doubt Ansari finds this character a way to unwind and do something different from his traditional standup style, but after nearly an hour of fine, imaginative comedy, the Randy character is just odious.

Though I enjoyed most of this, it's hard to recommend purchasing the DVD, even for established fans of Aziz Ansari, as the comedy is solid but in no way legendary.",1270598400,12,1188,5.087179487179487

3985894,5,B002TQKL0W,"Aziz's comedy is fast paced, original and universally (across ethnicities, not age demographics) funny. The content and the delivery is sure to make people laugh out loud. I watched the show over and over again a few times and the jokes are still funny. His natural talent is comparable to Dave Chappelle...",1268438400,,307,4.923076923076923
3985895,5,B002TQKL0W,"Funniest stand-up performance ever offered by Comedy Central period.  One of the funniest stand up performances of this era.  Aziz is the only aspect of the movie Funny People that was actually funny.  His character ""Randy"" is priceless.  This stand-up performance gives you an Aziz/Randy performance (without the DJ).  He is a true talent, and I have never laughed at an Indian...ever.  THIS GUY IS A FUNNY INDIAN!

""Intimate Moments"" is a video you can watch over and over like ""The Godfather"" or for me ""Mommy Dearest"". Monica",1266883200,,258,4.395833333333333
3985919,4,B002TQKL0W,"If you like stand up comedians like Dave Chappelle, Eddie Muprhy, Arj Barker and Russell Peters then this is perfect for you. Aziz is an up and comer and in his debut DVD he hits the mark.

Aziz found fame from appearing in Adam Sandlers film Funny People and appearing on TV shows Scrubs and Parks and Recreation but stand up is were he really shines. He is a new gen stand up comedian, he talks about stuff like Facebook and burning CD's. But he is really in his element talking about his night out with Kanye West and going to a R Kelly concert. Aziz delivers his lines with energy and charisma in such a likable way. And for all you RAAAAAAANDY fans don't worry he makes an appearance too.

If you love a good laugh and are into the comedians I mentioned earlier then don't hesistate in buying this. The main stand up goes for about 60 mins but there is also an additional 30 mins in the special features. So all in all its 90 mins of a good ol laugh.

3985921,3,B002TQKL0W,"Aziz is clever but his delivery comes off as rehearsed and nervous. He needs to relax on stage because his timing is a little off, this is the difference between having a conversation with the audience and throwing jokes as hard as you can hoping they will stick. The content is all there, he just needs more experience or confidence.",1264723200,4,334,4.583333333333333
3985922,5,B002TQKL0W,"I remember Aziz from FOtC and like many others, Funny People. Anyways this DVD is absolutely hilarious. And because I'm very picky about my comedy, that means I find Aziz hilarious. I remember getting the DVD as soon as it came out, watching it right away and laughing till I cried. Definitely recommend purchasing this, or the CD. Also, to all the RAAAAAAAANDY lovers, I've heard rumors that there will be a Randy movie or TV show. So keep a lookout :D",1264636800,3,453,4.536585365853658

3985925,4,B002TQKL0W,"Aziz Ansari has had a spectacular year in 2009 with a new television series ""Parks and Recreation"" and kicking off the year on ""Scrubs"".  Ansari has also appeared on films ""I Love You, Man"" and ""Funny People"".

Known for playing with characters for their witty humor, Ansari's comedic ties began while he was attending college at New York University where he performed stand up comedy in NYC especially at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater.  His comedy attracted a lot of people in the area and sure enough Rolling Stone Magazine added him on their hot list for ""Hot Standup"" and won the Jury Award for ""Best Standup"" for HBO's 2006 U.S. Comedy Arts Festival.  Ansari later toured with the Comedians of Comedy and the Flight of the Concords and in 2008, went on his own comedy tour titled ""Glow in the Dark"".

Now Ansari's special titled ""Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening"" is set for air on Comedy Central and his own Comedy Central DVD will be released and the first comedy DVD from the cable network to kick off 2010.

Ansari's comedy is quite different from other Comedy Central comedians in which we see the style of comedy shown from his characters are similar what you see on stage.  What I mean by that is, Ansari is cool.  He has this street like humor mixed in with this Gen Y style of comedy in which Ansari will joke about Craigslist, Facebook, gay rights, Cold Stone Creamery and his associate with friends such as Kanye West and R. Kelly.

Ansari talks about going on his young cousin Harris's Facebook page and messing around with comments and screwing with him on his message board, to interviewers who ask him questions about his feeling towards ""Slumdog Millionaire"", especially when he's born in South Carolina.  Ansari manages to keep things consistent throughout the whole performance but definitely saves the best for last as he talks about jokes about hanging out with Kanye West and watching R. Kelly live.  And for those who enjoyed Ansari's performance as Randy from the film ""Funny People"", Ansari has an encore performance as the character ""RAAAAAAAANDY"" included on the DVD.

Here is the following track list for ""Aziz Ansari: Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening"" and what you can expect from the DVD:

  1. Gay Rights
  2. Sheets
  3. CVS/Getting the Sniffles on a Flgiht
  4. Craigslist Ad
  5. My Ransom Roommate/Getting Recognized in New York
  6. Waking with Dinosaurs
  7. Simpleman Cruise
  8. My Cousin Harris
  9. Harassing Harris on Facebook
  10. Are White People Psyched All the Time?
  11. MTV's Next
  12. The J-1 Waiver/Using my BlackBerry While Driving
  13. Bonnaroo
  14. Cold Stone Creamery/Something Cool to Say to M.I.A.

  17. R. Kely: The Pied Pier of R and B
  18. RAAAAAAAANDY

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Aziz Ansari: Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening"" is presented in widescreen.  Picture quality is very good.  Solid blues and purple background, no busy background, pretty much the focus is on Aziz Ansari with several camera angles including a close up, full body, behind the audience and a camera focusing on the audience.  Editing is not dizzying as the camera follows Ansari and doesn't change too much.  No 3 to 5-second cuts, cuts are around 10-20 seconds and easy for the eyes.

Audio is presented in Dolby Digital and the comedy is front and center channel driven.  Ansari's vocals are clear and you can also hear the audience laughing.  For those who own a modern home theater receiver and a 5.1, 7.2 or higher speaker setup, some may want to select audio on all channels for a more immersive soundscape.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Aziz Ansari: Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening"" comes with the following special feature:

  * UCB Comedy Death Ray Performance - (30:35) Aziz Ansari's ""Comedy Death Ray Performance"" at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Los Angeles recorded on November 3, 2009.  The cool thing about this performance is that it's not a rehash of what he did on his Comedy Central performance, newer jokes and also crowd interaction as well.  From he and a friend wanting to go on a cross country trip to why he's getting a lot of hits from Tommy Talorico's (the video game TV host and video game music composer) website and how Ansari went on the site's forum to ask for love advice to googling his name.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Ansari's comedy for ""Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening"" was a fun comedy DVD and his presentation for his comedy is very different than other comedians.  In a way, his jokes are story-based and not fast-qipped style of jokes made for shock value but fast quipped-jokes that use things that people familiar with pop culture to online social media and more.  Ansari has a pretty smooth flow with his comedy and is not easily distracted and his delivery is pretty entertaining and just fun.

Again, his comedy routine is quite different from other comedians that have had Comedy Central DVD releases but in the end, I laughed and really enjoyed his stand-up comedy.  His comedy routine was pretty relaxed and you can tell he and the audience were having a fun time. It was great for Ansari to include the Death Ray comedy segment on the special features but it would be cool have more special features.  Maybe some jokes on the day in the life of Aziz Ansari or something really crazy sketch comedy routines or something.

Last, there are not too many Indian American comedians that you see on television and on film in mainstream America, so it's very cool to see Aziz Ansari get his own Comedy Central DVD and to see his comedy and his career flourishing is pretty awesome.

Overall, if you enjoyed Ansari's comedy on ""Parks and Recreation"", ""Funny People"", ""Scrubs"", etc. what you see onscreen, Ansari's style of comedy is captured in ""Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening"".  The DVD is pretty solid and  definitely a comedy DVD worth purchasing and also a reason to help Ansari have enough income to make a down payment on an nice country home.",1264464000,9,6028,4.751690821256038
3985926,5,B002TQKL0W,"I had never heard or seen any of Aziz's stand-up until this DVD, and I found it hilarious! I can't wait see more from him. My favorite part had to have been the part where he imitates R. Kelly.",1264464000,,193,3.9743589743589745
3985927,5,B002TQKL0W,Thought this DVD was great. His style of comedy is contagious and his storytelling is amazing. Aziz seems to find himself in the strangest of situations and lets the audience in on how hilariously awkward he felt! amazing!,1264377600,,222,4.868421052631579
3985928,5,B002TQKL0W,"There were two back-to-back tapings for this. I was at the second. I suspect they used segments from both. I saw myself in the crowd at the end so I know they at leats used part of the taping I saw.

Aziz has some really funny bits. I like the facebook and craigslist bits.

He has a unique style and his material is fresh.",1264377600,,323,4.03125
3985929,5,B002TQKL0W,"I saw his stand up special on Comedy Central Presents a couple weeks ago and I thought it was excellent! I don't think we hear or see enough of Aziz yet, a couple TV appearances here and Parks and Recreation there but I think this comedy special is really gonna put Aziz on the list of people to watch for 2010! His comedy is awesome and he just seems like a cool, down to Earth guy with great jokes! Def. a must have for comedy fans!",1264204800,,434,4.058139534883721
3985930,5,B002TQKL0W,This cd and dvd are both hilarious. One of my favorite comedy specials in a while.,1264118400,,82,4.1875
3985931,3,B002TQKL0W,"I suppose I'm the first to break the ranks. If you're a seasoned comedian fan, I don't think you can seriously compare Aziz to any of your top 10 or even top 20 comedians. Yes, I even have some newer comedians on that list. For some reason Aziz doesn't quite cut it. His material is fine. To some extent, I always felt that if a good comedian picked up Aziz's material, he could somehow make it funny. He sets up the jokes perfectly but never quite delivers the actual joke. His timing is also skewed. He seems to lack spontaneity, getting the feel of the audience and playing around with them.

In addition, he didn't take any big risks. He tries to be lewd, but still comes off clean.

In the end, I felt I like I was listening to a presentation just begging that his next bit would be funny. The funny only came here and there. Even the funny bits themselves seemed underdeveloped.

However, I understand he's just getting into comedy. If he hones his craft, I'm certainly hoping for future DVDs. There's nothing better than a comedian who keeps getting funnier with each special. All the best!",1264032000,5,1097,4.475
3985932,5,B002TQKL0W,"I have never before felt compelled to purchase a DVD of a stand up performance, but as soon as I was done watching this on Comedy Central, I was on Amazon looking it up to buy it.  I laughed out loud several times while watching this, and called more than one friend to tell them to turn to Comedy Central and watch this.  The humor is very current, and I love the excited, worked up way in which Aziz tells a story.  My favorite part is when he talks about harassing his cousin on facebook.  HILARIOUS!!",1264032000,3,504,4.21875
3985933,5,B002TQKL0W,"I predict that in a short while Aziz Ansari will be synonymous with the best in comedy.  He has chiseled a name for himself the old fashioned way by destroying crowds on the comedy circuit and slowly inching his way into film and television (Funny People, Human Giant, Parks and Recreation.)  What really set him apart for me is that unlike 95% of all non-Caucasian comedians, he isn't making race jokes for the majority of his set and his stuff is fresh and the topics have broad range.  For the movie Funny People he created a brash, loud-mouthed alter ego called 'Raaaaaaaandy' who is featured at the end of this DVD.  It's great that he's continued to use him occasionally as it allows him to completely change his style instantly, yet seamlessly so that it totally works on stage with the audience.  I highly suggest watching this DVD or listening to the CD - really good stuff.  And if you should be so fortunate as to have him doing some stand-up in your town go see him live! Absolutely brilliant stuff this guy is doing.",1263859200,,1029,4.535135135135135

3985936,5,B002TQKL0W,"Aziz Ansari is the best comedian in the game today. The man is total class. His comedy is like the divine words of deities. It is a wonder where he puts his halo, because this man is the patron saint of funny. Buy this. Buy two of these, because you are going to laugh so hard that you will get mad and try and destroy the thing you love the most, but it's ok because you still have that other copy you bought.",1263772800,2,410,3.9518072289156625

I actually came on Amazon.com to see if it's up for sale, and it is, so I will be buying this no doubt.  The Cold Stone and Kanye West parts were my favorite so far...definitely check this out!",1263772800,3,298,3.95

Aziz goes the extra mile in his routine as he incoprates music, singing, and ofcourse, impersonations. His material feels fresh and his stage presence felt natural. Though i don't think all his jokes will reach every audience in the way of big names like Kevon Hart or Gabriel Iglesias.",1496707200,,503,4.6
