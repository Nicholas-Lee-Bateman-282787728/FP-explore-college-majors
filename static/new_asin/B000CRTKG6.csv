8101693,2,B000CRTKG6,"The first secion of this video is just beyond basic and worthless to anyone but true beginners.

I own dozens of videos, and this one is the most worthless waste of time that I own.

To the others that rate it highly, I can only assume they are new to the BB coaching game and don't have anything to compare it to.

Gannon Bakers video absolutely blows this away.  There is just no comparison.  Watch it, then go back and watch this video and you'll see what I mean.",1217376000,,466,4.191011235955056
8101694,5,B000CRTKG6,"I bought this DVD for an 11 year girl, she said it was interesting and usefull for her to watch and learn. She practicies with a caoch at school and this DVD helped her improve the game and understand it better.
I haven't seen the DVD myself.. but I had the feeling she liked it as a birthday present.",1203465600,,301,4.11864406779661

8101696,5,B000CRTKG6,"This is hands down the best DVD I've seen for youth basketball coaches seeking teaching techniques and offensive and defensive strategies.  Disk one teaches every aspect of individual mechanics.

Disk two takes the coach through practice organization with drills designed for four areas (1) offense to defense, (2) defense, (3) defense to offense, and (4) offense.  The defense sections teaches both man and zone strategies, while the offense section teaches both man and zone offensive schemes.

The practice and team organization disk is taught primarily by a 9 time national champion youth AAU coach.  This is particularly good for the youth coach because the instructor distinguishes between those drills and strategies designed for older players and those designed for the 8-10 yr old player.

This is a great resource that I expect to use for years to come and the quality of the DVD matches what one would expect from a two-time MVP.",1169424000,10,940,5.111111111111111
8101697,5,B000CRTKG6,This summer I decided to run a girl's basketball drills and skills program through my local city sports league.  This DVD caught my eye and I decided make the purchase.

You'll have my summer basketball camp running much more smoothly.  Thanks!,1150675200,,382,4.641791044776119
8101698,5,B000CRTKG6,"This DVD is the best basketball instructional DVD on the market. Disc one covers the most basic fundamentals from ball handling, shooting, passing, and defense. This DVD has improved my game dramatically.

It has help me with my shot, especially my release, he offers secret ways to help perfect that soft touch shooting release that hs made him so successful.

He shares his very own ball handling practice drills consisting from crossovers, spins, behind the back dribble, and between the legs. I am 6ft6 and handle almost like a point guard because of this DVD.

While Steve primarily works with kids, aging from 8 to 13 years old, this DVD will help anyone's game. The DVD is very professional with use of certain camera angles while drill routines are being performed.

Disc two is more focused on team play and practice organization, Steve, along with a fellow coach, demonstrate drills of fast breaks, defensive stops, offense, and much more. This could be helpful for any young aspiring coach.

You can insert this disc into your PC DVD-ROM drive and download the entire team play and practice organization guide.

Overall I would recommend this DVD to any aspiring basketball player.
