2865710,5,B000RFO0Q8,"This baroque pastiche opera, premiered at the Met last New Year's Eve, is a delightful treat for any opera lover, and would serve as a great introduction to opera, since it's in English and features a top-notch cast and design!
The opera takes the plots of Shakespeare's Tempest and the lovers of A Midsummer Night's Dream and conflates them into a rollicking story of shipwreck, mistaken identities, revenge, longing, and finally reconciliation and love. DiDonato's Sycorax is a tour de force, ripping off revenge arias and playing them to the hilt, but with impeccable musciality.  If you're a fan of DiDonato, this is a must have. Danielle Di Niesse was a discovery for me in the role of Ariel--her beautiful soprano fills the stage with electricity, and she plays both the serious and comic sides of the magical sprite perfectly. Placido Domingo plays Neptune, the sea God, in a great small role. The rest of the cast is pitch-perfect and strongly cast. It IS a bit long, but with a cast this great, that hardly registers. The role of Prospero is also sung by a countertenor, which is a rarity (since Baroque operas, which use them the most, are rarely seen), but last year's Met season gave us two big countertenor showpieces (here and in Rodelinda, with Renee Fleming, also on DVD).
This is a magical production that is definitely worth its space on your Opera Shelf. I didn't notice any problems with picture or sound with it being on DVD; it was very clear in both respects. (I guess, OK, Blu-Ray would have made it EVEN BETTER...but I really wanted to have this. And I have patience problems. :) )",1355356800,26,1606,4.715302491103203
2865711,1,B000RFO0Q8,"This performance was simulcast in HD, so HD source material exists. There is no excuse for not producing it in Blu-ray. I loved the music and the presentation, and saw both the original simulcast and the encore showing in a local theater. I also listened to five different live performances simulcast on SiriusXM.

Without a Blu-ray version, I'll just retain the for-personal-use off-the-air copies I made when it was broadcast on SiriusXM and later shown on PBS. Why would I waste my money on something that is not substantially better than the low-bit-rate material that was broadcast, and that is appreciably worse than what was shown in the theaters? What's the point of owning a large screen if the available source material is not HD?",1355270400,6,740,4.92
2865712,5,B000RFO0Q8,I have not listened to the DVD yet.. I watched the broadcast expecting to be mildly interested because I really prefer the later styles of opera: the romantics and the Russian.

I should add that I was at the New Year's Eve prima of this pastiche, and it was the most magical evening I'd ever experienced at the Met. I desperately want to have this, but I'm thinking SURELY they will release it on Blu-ray, so I will delay my purchase for now.",1353628800,12,530,4.353535353535354
2865714,1,B000RFO0Q8,"I whole-heartedly agree with Bob North that there is no excuse for issuing non-blu-ray discs of new operatic productions.  The difference in quality between regular HD and Blu-ray is astounding.  In fact, the studios/publishers who release new operatic discs, in this case Virgin Classics, should know that I often do NOT buy new HD operatic discs because I assume that eventually they will be released on blu-ray.  And if they aren't, I simply end up not buying them.  This performance of ""The Enchanted Island"" has received rave reviews from my operatic friends who saw the original broadcast, and I would love to buy it.  But I will wait until the blu-ray appears, if ever!",1353628800,21,676,4.894736842105263
2865715,5,B000RFO0Q8,"I loved the program as broadcast on PBS in High Definition. It is a wonderful show. Why on earth is it not blu-ray? Is a blu-ray coming? I think the show is great for opera evangelism. Opera fans: why would you not insist on blu-ray? Blu-ray is perfect venue for opera. Seriously, DVD should be over except for old material that will never make it to blu-ray in your lifetime. Blu-ray is like cleaning the butter off of your glasses. It is cheap and easy.",1351555200,10,455,4.364705882352941
2865716,5,B000RFO0Q8,"Vanishing Florida

With a vanishing landscape all around Florida it's great to see some backwoods Florida presented in a thoughtful, meaningful motion picture.

Julius Harris

Actor Julius Harris plays Booker a man who knows the way of the world(s) the here and now and a special portal where extraordinary life comes from another place. Booker plays his character slow, deliberate, back woods like. Enjoyable to see a characterization exuding country, deep woods Florida country.

Love Interest

Will Sennett plays Royce with a love interest Twyla played by Casey Blanton. These two work well portraying ethereal 5th dimension type people comfortable with each other, willing to forgo selfish got-to-know or no relationship sentimentality.

Director Carter Lord

I wanted to see Director Lord on screen but he did not portray a roll in THE ENCHANTED; yet he was seen on every frame speaking with his down home presentational style. See Director Lord in on screen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lithium-Springs/dp/B000RFDE10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lithium Springs</a>.

Art On The Wall

Director Lord presented a very complex story through Twyla's paintings. She painted this complex story in a room in Royce's Florida cracker house previously occupied by Royse's aunt who left a good vibe in the room enabling Twyla to put on the wall her complex feelings.

Florida Has Magical Stories

Carter Lord presents a Magical Florida story with THE ENCHANTED. A soft, delicate look at mystical shape shifting in a down home Florida cracker ranch land.

2865717,5,B000RFO0Q8,"The Enchanted is surreal and hauntingly beautiful. Reminiscent of the old Deep South, it some of the most stunning cinematography I have seen, with a curious and unexpected twist in the story line. I highly recommend it.",1250294400,,220,4.972972972972973
2865718,5,B000RFO0Q8,"As I just finished an Amazon review for Carter Lord's recent 'Lithium Springs', I feel it's incumbent upon me to critique the 'original' Lord offering, 'The Enchanted'. It is a film which showed up, out of the blue, on CBS's 'Movie of the Week' back in 1986... I've been trying to track it down ever since, sporadically (in recent years) hitting the various search engines to no avail.  But now it has arrived on DVD, and those of us who saw it in the dim distant past and were thoroughly Enchanted in the first place, and who have waited with bated breath for it to resurface, are finally reaping our reward. Like 'Lithium Springs', 'The Enchanted' involves the wilds of Florida, specifically a locale called 'Hole in the Wall', a dividing line between what passes for 'normal' life, and that of a world apart peopled by sweet-tempered shape-shifters. These careful creatures mix uneasily with their neighbors as their blended lives evolve, while a few, less gentle outside events create satisfying dramatic tension. 'The Enchanted' is a mesmerizing film ~ visually stunning (shot in 35mm)throughout, with a perfectly melded musical score. It is not an obvious movie; the viewer must focus and collect the clues as life in 'Hole in the Wall' unfolds in all its richness. 'The Enchanted' is a fair allegory in the guise of a fantasy.  See it.",1249430400,2,1342,4.8304347826086955

2865723,5,B000RFO0Q8,"I was fascinated when I first saw this new production on the big screen of our local movie house as a ""Live from the Met"" offering.
It was thrilling to see the live (revised) production at the Met this year. The lyrics are so cleverly integrated into the old Handel arias and the baroque musical style is faithfully followed.  It is a joy to watch the star-studded cast act out this clever pastiche.",1413417600,,399,4.465753424657534

It's a delightful reworking of Baroque music, with new libretto and story by Jeremy Sams, come to life through Baroque master singers David Daniels, Danielle de Niese, and Joyce DiDonato, but the entire cast is wonderful. The performances have me smiling, the music singing in my head. I need to see if there's a CD too, so I can play the music over and over!",1408924800,,475,4.534883720930233
2865727,5,B000RFO0Q8,"This movie is unique, and is probably one of the best unheralded movies of the 1980's in its genre (which I would call independent, low-budget horror/fantasy).  The cinematography is wonderful and it offers a glimpse of Florida most people never see, which is the rural, inland part -- not the beaches and the theme parks and the big cities.  The story is fascinating, and I'm sure will reward more than one viewing.  Without giving away too much, a young man (ably played by Will Sennett) comes home and meets up with an old friend of the family, Booker T (played by the amazing Julius Harris, in a very different role from his usual kingpin/bad guy kind of role in the seventies) and starts a cattle farm.  Then he meets a strange family who help him out, and he falls for one of their daughters, despite the dire warnings of Booker T to not to get ""too close"" to the Purdeys.  Meanwhile Royce's herd begins to be attacked at night by something like a wolf, but of course things are not at all what they seem.

The DVD is nice, but I wish they were able to throw in some kind of extra, even a director's commentary, but there is just so much more you want to know after you watch it.  Also, I caught most of the dialogue, being a southerner, but some of it I couldn't understand, and subtitles would help.  These are minor quibbles.  If you are a fan of older movies from the eighties, this is one that is a must.  Along the way it is educational if one wants to visit the true Florida or the true South for that matter, for here we have people interacting in a different, gentler manner than the stereotypes, glimpses of the near tropical forest and the diversity of wildlife, and even a look at the cowboys of the South in passing.  Truly a great film.",1407283200,,1756,4.355828220858895
2865728,5,B000RFO0Q8,"I purchased this right from the director as a gift for a friend that had been looking for it forever. Carter Lord, the director was nice enough to send me some personal emails to find out how I heard about and what I thought about the film. He also sent me a copy of his other film Lithium Springs.

Both films are very enjoyable. Buy them if you can find them.",1407196800,,361,4.084507042253521
2865729,3,B000RFO0Q8,"It was an interesting idea to create an opera pastiche in the old style, but the singing
just doesn't live up to the standards the music upholds. Few of the performers
burst forth either as characters or sheer vocalists the way they do in the best
Handel or Rossini DVDs. Or the way, say, Marilyn Horne gets into ""Iris, Hence
Away"" on CD, not to mention Joan Sutherland's old music. We've heard virtuosos
in this kind of opera, and it's silly to backtrack with careful, plodding singers at this
point. Their diction is terrible, too.",1403308800,,533,4.621052631578947

As soon as she received it she and her husband viewed it--and then she called and nearly leapt through the phone to regale me with its highlights!

2865732,5,B000RFO0Q8,"How many times in the last fifty years or so has the MET offered a production with even one countertenor, much less two? And three female leads in outstanding form; Danielle de Niese, Joyce DiDonato and Lisette Oropesa. Plus the MET stalwart Placido Domingo is also a participant. This Baroque pastiche is a musical delight and a visual pleasure with its staging and fantastic costumes. Audience response during the closing curtain calls is indicative of the quality of the production. The look on the youthful face of Anthony Roth Constanzo responding to the audience accolades when he takes his solo bow is priceless. But, the loudest cheers deservedly go to David Daniels whose countertenor performance was mesmerizing.",1397520000,,722,5.17948717948718
2865733,1,B000RFO0Q8,"The venality and contempt for its customers that Virgin Classics and Met Opera reveal by issuing this opera first on DVD is scandalous. This new opera was recorded on high-definition digital equipment (so it could be projected in HD in theaters), so there is no excuse in not releasing this first in Blu-ray. Releasing it first in DVD and later in Blu-ray is a marketing ploy that is only designed to increase profits by encouraging music lovers to buy two versions of the same performance. This behavior is so shameful.

I will not buy this DVD recording of The Enchanted Island despite how much I enjoyed seeing it in HD and listening to it again on Sirius. I love Baroque music and I thought this pastiche was well-conceived and produced. The music, singing, and acting are all first-rate and a Blu-ray version would be a 5-star item. I plan to buy the Blu-ray version if it ever becomes available. I have no problem purchasing old videos on DVD that were recorded before HD digital recordings existed or cannot be converted to Blu-ray from film for economics of potential sales reasons (although that should be possible in every case; just look at Criterion). But I refuse to buy a DVD when the original recent performance was recorded on HD equipment that could be directly sold as a Blu-ray. Virgin Classics had to actually take the effort to REDUCE the digital resolution and sound to manufacture their DVDs! It would have been easier to just produce Blu-ray disks in the first place.

One commenter wrote, ""But he (and you) are not taking into account the many people out there who cannot afford (or do not choose to invest in) Blu-ray technology."" This is just nonsense. Today Blu-ray equipment and recordings are no, or very slightly, more expensive than DVD equipment and recordings, and the video improvement is much, much better. There is no technical or financial reason not to release a Blu-ray version only or simultaneously with a DVD version IF the interests of the consumer are given priority--not the profit margin of the manufacturers.

Another commenter, DSanderson, wrote, ""Well, that's Virgin Classics for you. They have yet to release any opera productions on Blu-ray in the U.S., and I believe the same is true for EMI (although the Kaufmann Tosca on Blu-ray is available from Canada and elsewhere, but not in the US). It truly sucks. I hope Virgin/EMI are not granted rights to any future Met productions, and that the Met will instead stick with DGG and Decca."" I wholeheartedly agree with this comment.

2865737,4,B000RFO0Q8,"As is the case with many others, I am using my home-burned DVD of the PBS broadcast until a blu-ray disk comes out.  I second anything positive said in these reviews.  The production is just delightful.  I first heard The Enchanted Island on radio and immediately began searching for a recording.  I've watched it several times and played the music in the background on even more occasions.

There's only one problem: Placido Domingo.  Yes, I know he's a God and all of that, and I suppose his ""star"" quality was thought to add to the general delight of the production.  But his poor command of the rhythms of the English language damage the performance.  It's not the thick accent or the voice; Domingo's arias are just clumsy and distracting.  Caliban managed to get it right - do we have to forgive Neptune?

Sorry, I fully realize that I am unworthy to offer such criticism, but I don't enjoy being shocked out of deep immersion in fantasy.  This doesn't mean I won't buy the blu-ray.  Until then, I'll just change to my really nice costume, pick up my lunchbox, and wander off.

(They bear no relation to the original lyrics of the arias, and it is sung in English with excellent English subtitles. Truly a gem, a masterpiece that is ""loosely"" based on the plot of The Tempest and one other Shakespeare play. Costuming is superb. Better singing you will not hear today for Baroque music. Pure fun and delight. Note: The first act is longer than the second-- it should have ended after Neptune's (Domingo) scene. But that's something you can correct when you watch the DVD.

I was lucky enough to catch this 'Live At The Met in HD' showing, early in 2012, and it was one of the highlights of that season for me, so i was delighted when a fellow reviewer alerted me to the release of the DVD.

And I'm pretty well as delighted as I was, on seeing it 'live' last year. It is a brilliantly showy, inventive production, using works from Handel, Vivaldi, Rameau, Purcell, and other less-well known composers, and an outrageously playful mash-up libretto from Jeremy Sams. The story combines Prospero, Miranda, Ferdinand, Caliban, Ariel and the island from The Tempest together with the four lovers from Midsummer Night's Dream. And then some - enter a missing character - Neptune, given the imaginative buildup of a stage full of flying mermaids, the only accompaniment possible really, given the casting of Placido Domingo as Neptune

Full of wonderful comedy and oozily saccharine Broadway moments the lovers from Midsummer Night's dream enact all the delicious comedy brought in by Ariel-as-Puck getting it wrong with who falls in love with whom, but there is also room for deep pain, transformation, betrayal, and true forgiveness. And the various musical pieces accommodate all this.

There are also lots of nods to a couple of Mozart operas - the 4 lovers of course from The Dream, recast into Cosi Fan Tutte, but more obviously, Prospero and Sycorax, Caliban's mother, given some wonderfully showy arias, bring elements of Sarastro and Queen of The Night to mind.

Stand out, for me, is David Daniels, the countertenor voice giving Prospero a real power and strangeness, and Joyce Di Donato, as Sycorax singing her heart out, with music ranging from the firework cracking spectacle to deeply tender and intimate. Indeed, the most tear jerking aria was the quiet 'Hearts that love will all be broken' which Sycorax sings to her son - a heartbreaking performance by Luca Pisaroni, who almost steals the scene without uttering a sound, through his piteous body language and expression.

The production team of Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch absolutely guarantee inventiveness, magic, theatricality. And they deliver. What more could anyone want? There is even a lasciviously rude goatish goblin ballet, Helena as a slightly dippy hippy botanist, and a plethora of visual delights, sumptious costumes - and of course, the music, the music, the music

The short extras on the second disc involve interviews with the stars, conductor, librettist, producer and designer.

I heartily recommend this - keeping fingers crossed you get the 60% discs that work, not the 40% that don't.",1365292800,11,3031,4.917808219178082

2865758,5,B000RFO0Q8,"We so thoroughly enjoyed ""The Enchanted Island"" when it was presented as part of the MetOpera ""Live in HD"" series in movie theatres worldwide, we ""had"" to have a copy for our own DVD library. The singing is top-notch, the sets/scenery, costumes, EVERYTHING, is first-class. The story is loosely drawn from two of Shakespeare's plays and then set to music by various Baroque period composers. ""Island"" is at times mysterious, poignant, funny, moving; it grabs all your senses and emotions. This DVD even includes much of the intermission features from the HD broadcast that include interviews with the principal singers, director, writer, conductor, etc. The HD broadcast intermission interviews and features are, in my opinion, one of the compelling components of the theatre series that make the opera productions so enjoyable; you're getting an ""insider's look"" at the production and its principal players, directors, etc.
To my awareness, this MetOpera production of ""The Enchanted Island"" is a one-of-a-kind production and well worth having on DVD for your on-going enjoyment.

The DVD almost fully captures the experience of being there. The video framing is first-rate. For those who have not seen this wonderful ""pastiche"", be ready for a treat. The singing is superb, the conducting by the great baroque specialist, William Christie, is spot-on. The old-style, cut-out sets, enhanced by lighting make a far, far better impact than the recent Met Ring. The choice of music is excellent.

I purchased the Met's Onegin with Fleming and Hvorstovsky because a Blu-Ray wasn't available and I didn't want the item to go out of print before I had a copy of that incredible performance! Then lo and behold they released a Blu-Ray. I was so aggravated that I held off for months on replacing my DVD with the Blu-Ray, but the difference in quality is (as one previous reviewer put it) like scraping butter off your glasses. I think that this might be some kind of stupid marketing ploy (stupid being the operative word).  I don't understand why the entire catalog of HD performances wouldn't be automatcially released on Blu-Ray.  There isn't any issue of cleaning up source material.  I remember purchasing the Sutherland Lucia when the Met finally released it on DVD (my VCR tape was in truly bad shape) and they did NOTHING to clean up the quality, just a straigt transfer!  Really quite ridiculous.  I wish the Met would get their act together and do simul release of DVD with Blu-Ray. They have a huge catalog of performances that should be cleaned up and reissued, all stuff they have previously made their money back on, so the next round would be nearly straight profit!

8200364,4,B000RFO0Q8,"I had regretfully missed the cinematic transmission of the Metropolitan Opera's new pasticcio, ""The Enchanted Island,"" the story after William Shakespeare and the music cobbled together from seven (!) baroque composers.  I viewed it via PBS.

I felt it an exercise in futility: Why not simply mount one of the many operas of that period that the Met has yet to present? Like the creation of castrati, the practice of operatic pasticcio is perhaps best buried in the past.

That said, it was an excuse for fine singing. The large cast was mostly delightful, starring Joyce DiDonato, David Daniels, Plcido Domingo, Danielle de Niese, Luca Pisaroni, Lisette Oropesa, and Anthony Roth Costanzo, well conducted by William Christie. The production, by Phelim McDermott, was childish; the baroque calling for grace and stylisation, McDermott delivering the dryly mundane.

DiDonato's singing was lovely, as was expected, although her limited abilities as an actress did not encompass the flamboyant sorceress Sycorax; Domingo was astonishing as the god Neptune, thrilling us as he has done for generations; de Niese was brilliant as Ariel, giving a vocal and theatrical tour-de-force; the handsome Pisaroni was marvelous as Caliban, gaining sympathy even through his thick make-up; Oropesa was an incomparable Miranda; and Costanzo was excellent, as well.

The only complete disappointment was Daniels as Prospero, lacking in thrust and intensity in both voice and acting. It is a mystery why his career has prospered far beyond any of the great counter-tenors of our day, most obviously Derek Lee Ragin.
