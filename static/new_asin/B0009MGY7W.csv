8063204,5,B0009MGY7W,"This video is far more than train ride experience in China. It takes you to in-depth tour of several North China cities such as Beijing, Xi'an, and Datong, as well as a section of Great Wall outside Beijing City proper. A lot is covered about Chinese people's daily life, tradition and cuisines. I would have wished it cover South China but it does not. It's also kinda dated being produced in 1995 which is 20 years ago. Considering its reasonable price and enduring charm and quality, I give it 5 stars.",1448496000,,505,4.56043956043956

8063207,4,B0009MGY7W,"Comfortable train ride through Scotland/Wales, showing villages, breath-taking landscapes, castles and gardens.  You glimpse the Scottish pomp -- bagpipes and kilt uniforms.  The trains are old, some steam engines and one a pulley (fanicula).  Conveyances are explained in some detail.  I enjoyed and recommend this video.",1202342400,2,322,5.934782608695652
