Now, so many years later, I just plunked down $40 for a copy and think it was well worth it.  Yes, it's historically inaccurate but, of all the books and films about the Hatfields and McCoys, I like this because it's the way it SHOULD have been.  (Perfect world and all of that.)",1392249600,,400,4.089743589743589
7857903,5,6303922201,"This was a gift for my Mother. She remembered watching it when she was young and wanted to see it. When I went to reseach it, I was surprised it could even be purchased as it was made in 1949. She was so thrilled to see it again. I'm sure it brought back lots of memories.",1385510400,,272,3.875
7857904,3,6303922201,"I saw this movie in the theater years and years ago.  I remember liking it, but mainly I still remember that song Rosanna.  My mom came from somewhere near those parts and I asked her about it.  I don't know if she ever met any of them.  Her parents had a general store somewhere near the area.  But she had heard of them, and maybe she told me she had seen them, but I don't remember. Anyway, I'd like to see that film again on DVD.  But it probably won't show up on DVD.  Too bad.",1317686400,,482,3.9583333333333335
7857905,4,6303922201,"It was an enjoyable film. I'd read The Coffin Quilt and a book or two on the subject, so I was intrigued in seeing this movie for a while. It's been mind-bogglingly a pain in the rear to get, but luckily, someone was selling it on Ebay for ten dollars, so I bought it and was ready to see how Hollywood might handle the feud. Full of historical inaccuracies, the movie didn't really stick to the facts at all. First of all, the actress to portray the heroine was only fifteen, when in real life, Roseanna McCoy was twenty-one when she met Johnse Hatfield (who was a few years her junior in real life). Also, where were the other ten children sired by Randolph McCoy and the children had by Devil Anse? They weren't in the movie either, nor was the election day fight (okay, okay, there was a fight, but it didn't lead to the demise of the three McCoy boys), or even the house burning incident.

Despite these little nitpicks, I did enjoy watching the movie. There were a few times when I found myself chortling, though they probably could have picked someone a little older to portray the heroine of the tale. And I couldn't take my eyes off handsome Marshall Thompson, who portrayed Roseanna's older brother. I do think they should rerelease this so other people can watch it, being that it's so hard to obtain (unless you want to pay the $50+ for it). Other than the few nitpicks, I had fun watching it and realizing the inaccuracies. Supposedly, another Hatfield-McCoy movie is to be made in the future and Brad Pitt might be in it...I guess it's tentative, though...",1134000000,4,1570,4.508771929824562
