8541680,1,B009HUGVGQ,"Terrible inside of the dvd.  Comes with 4 disc's and the disc holder (plastic in center)  was literally in pieces inside the dvd box with the dvd's loose and rolling around.  There is no way to keep the disc's in the middle.  Nothing left for it to hold on to.  I want another box,  I am going to try to return this item.  Never did this before from amazon.",1358899200,5,357,4.086956521739131
