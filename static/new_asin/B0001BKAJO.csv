1986451,4,B0001BKAJO,"As a Howard Stern,fan how could you not like the ""Brat Pack"".Matter of fact one of the actor's/actress I personally knew. From Cleveland,Ohio the girl in the rage throwing lamp's and such. May she R.I.P. A good D-list movie.",1352160000,2,224,4.769230769230769
1986452,1,B0001BKAJO,"This has to be the worst DVD i have ever bought. Not only is this extremely tame and not in the least bit offensive,its not even the remotest bit funny to compensate. Beetle uncensored doesnt even come close to REAL 'shock documentries' like Steve-O,CKY and Jackass. The very few pranks that u see are repeated over and over again and are neither crude,shocking or funny...at least 1 out of 3 would be OK,but not in this case...Basically put,if u enjoy flushing your hard earned dollars down the toilet,then this is a must see.",1092873600,4,527,4.67741935483871
8009757,5,B0001BKAJO,"I'd say only 10-20% of this has made it to YouTube.  This is Beet during his hottest, happiest time with Shawn, Jamie and others.  Pumping gas completely nude for strangers, uh yeah.",1505088000,,182,4.65625
8009758,5,B0001BKAJO,Hilarious. If you love beetlejuice def order this. I just wish it included some of howard sterns interviews or some of his live shows although it is interesting to just see him on the road jackass style.,1480464000,,203,4.513513513513513
8009759,5,B0001BKAJO,I watched this movie like 50 times two times. I watched this movie like 300 times. I watched this movie because il like ten feet tall three hundred pounds. Classic Beet!!,1470528000,,170,4.516129032258065

8009764,2,B0001BKAJO,"This rating is based off of no high expectations of this product.  By me knowing the character
Beetlejuice, this was pretty much what I expected.
I dislike the quality of the dvd, but again, its a Beetlejuice produced product.  I liked the behind the
scenes footage.  I would only recommend this product to those that are truly Beetlejuice fans.  If
you do not follow him, you will not understand him or his crazy antics.",1396828800,,421,4.648648648648648
