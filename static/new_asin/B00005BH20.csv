The closest I got was the intro playing in the menu window. What I ended up getting was the ""Villains:Ultimate Doom"" disc, despite it being labeled as ""Heroes:Rebirth""  This may (or may not) explain why this title is mysteriously out of stock only scant days before coming out. I was more than a little disappointed, given Rhino's track record of doing really *good* jobs with their old 80s cartoons.  Not recommended until the kinks are worked out for well and good.

It is also the entire version of Season 4 of The American Transformers cartoon series and the three part series finale. It introduces a great bunch of intresting characters such as the Autobot Headmasters Cerebros, Chromedome,Brainstorm, Hardhead,Highbrow, and Fortress Maximus. the Autobot Tagetmasters also make an apperance, Pointblank,Sureshot and Crosshairs. These Autobots crash land on an alien planet known as Nebulos. The Decepticons follow. There, the Autobots meet the Nebulans, the alien inhabitants and the slaves of the evil slavemasters known as the Hive. The Nebulans binary bound with the Autobots as their heads and weapons!

1423124,3,B00005BH20,"By 1986, the Transformers were still very popular, but fans had grown tired of the show, especially since its 3rd season changed its tone very drastically.  It was more of a ""space bonanza"" kind of show and it no longer featured our hero, Optimus Prime.  After the show's producers responded to the demands of the fans wanting Optimus Prime back, they ended Season 3 with his much-welcomed resurrection.  They geared up for a 4th season, but by now, the popularity had waned, and thus the series ended with one last three-parter that was initially intended to launch the would-be 4th season.  ""Rebirth"" introduced many new Transformers into the mix, most of them being the Headmasters (robots that transformed from the robots' heads) and the Targetmasters (robots that transformed from weapons).
Our story is about a planet called Nebulos, in which the society is fighting back against their evil rulers, ""The Hive.""  The Hive control all the machinery and basically do their dirtywork.  Several autobots crash-land on the planet after being pursued by the decepticons.  The autobots had the ""key to the plasma energy chamber"" which was what the Transformers were forged from (or maybe it was just the autobots?).  Once the decepticons find them on the planet, both robotic factions take sides and engage in combat.  Optimus Prime discovers this because of Alpha Trion (who merged with Vector Sigma, recall), who says that Vector Sigma allowed Galvatron to know of the key.  New battles are fought, new Transformers are introduced, and the decepticons are shot halfway across the galaxy while Cybertron hits another Golden Age.
Plotwise, it's ok, but most of the episodes spend time introducing the new characters and this planet that they're on.  It seems like it could've been a decent direction for the show had it lasted longer, but instead, everything seems crammed together.  The ""love"" relationship between autobot Arcee and human Daniel is rather disturbing to say the least.  After all, wasn't Arcee supposed to hook up with Hot Rod or Springer anyways?  Speaking of which, Hot Rod was also disappointing in this episode.  He has returned to the ""young-in"" that was portrayed in the movie, but seriously, after leading the autobots for almost a friggen year you think he could've matured a little.  It's like the third season never happened.
Overall, while it's certainly not a terrible episode, I find myself wishing the Transformers series had ended on a better note.  ""The Return of the Optimus Prime"" seemed like a near-perfect ending to me, with Prime gaining Galvatron's respect and all.  Maybe I'm just thinking this way because it's the Transformers last hoorah and being a fan of this show, I never wanted it to end.  A must for Transformers fans; others needn't bother.",1076284800,10,2788,5.034858387799564
1423125,5,B00005BH20,"Pt. 1
Autobot City is being attacked by Decepticons, the Decep Clones stole the key to the Plasma Energy Chamber leaving Punch badly damaged. The Decepticons retreated to Cybertron to open the Plasma Energy Chamber,and destroy some Autobots along with it. Few of the Autobots took the key back from Scourge and was launched to another planet called Nebulos. A little while after the Decepticons followed the Autobots, where they found them captured by the natives of Nebulos. So, the Decepticons captured half of the Autobots to find out the whereabouts of the key.
Pt. 2
In order for the Autobots to save their comrades, they have to partner up with Nebulans to become Headmasters and Targetmasters. While all that is going on, Optimus Prime managed to go to Vector Sigma and found out the Autobots whereabouts also the deadly secret of plasma energy. So, Optimus used another shuttle to get key and his Autobots. By the time he got to Nebulos, the Autobots have already lost the key to the Decep Head & Targetmasters. Prime and the Auto Head & Targetmasters went to retrieve the key from them again, but finds a big surprise waiting to surface and show its ugly head ""Scorponok"".
Pt. 3
Scorponok and the Decepticons fled Nebulos and went back to Cybertron. Optimus and the Autobots followed them back, but Spike insisted that him and Cerebros should stay. The Decepticons made it with the key and deactivated every Autobot on Cybertron, Prime and the others had got there too late. So they tried to find the Galvatron and stop but that plan failed. Galvatron has already activated the Plasma Energy Chamber, but he also failed when Spike and Cerebros arrived with ""Fortress Maximus"" and saved the entire universe from being destroyed.

1423126,5,B00005BH20,"THE classic 80s cartoon series
PICTURE QUALITY (5/5 STARS)
Picture is far better than the VILLAINS DVD, one reason is the newer source material (1987 instead of 1984). Though overall sharpness could be better, it is sufficient for a cartoon series and leaves nothing open.
SOUND QUALITY (4/5 STARS)
Original stereo soundtrack - unchanged - no flaws but a bit flat naturally.
EXTRAS (1/5 STARS)
Nothing, absolutly nothing. Check out the season boxsets instead!
SPECIAL/UNIQUE ON THIS DVD RELEASE:
- original visual content - not remastered
- original stereo soundtrack - not remastered
COMMENT:
This 3-part story called ""Rebirth"" is the only episode of season 4. Directly placed after the season 3 two-parter ""Return of Optimus Prime"" it introduces the new Headmasters and Targetmasters. In Japan the series went on with the ""Transformers: Headmasters"" spin-off series and many more. ""Rebirth"" will be included in Rhino's Season 3 Part 2 boxset. There is no and will never be a season 4 boxset - only this DVD and the Season 3 Part 2 boxset.

1423127,3,B00005BH20,"This is the 3-part series finale of the original Transformers. Most people will say that the two-part ""The Return of Optimus Prime"" would have made a much better finale. I completely agree. ""Rebirth"" was more of a three-episode toy commercial than an ending for one of the best cartoons ever. Actually, in terms of depth, it's probably one of the lesser episodes. Still, it does have its merits. The friendship between Arcee and Daniel is more closely developed than in previous episodes, the pacifistic Cerebros adds a bit of balance and morality to the situation, and Cybertron is finally restored.
Now, I'm not too sure what this whole ""Heroes"" thing is about. I'm also not sure why another 3-part episode, ""The Ultimate Doom,"" was released with a similar ""Villains"" theme. It doesn't really make sense. It's not really harmful tot he disc's material, though, so I'll let it slide.
To be honest, ""The Ultimate Doom"" (the ""Villains"" disc) is a lot better than this one. ""Rebirth"" is really more for the core Transformers fans who must have all the episodes; if you're a more casual fan looking for something a bit more mainstream, pick up ""The Ultimate Doom"" or the complete first season boxed set instead. If you already have those, then pick up this one as well, because it's worth it.",1027123200,2,1289,4.8108108108108105

Targetmasters, Headmasters, Optimus Prime, Hot Rod, ummmm..... bumble..I mean, goldbug?.... nah, he [is smelly] and all TRUE Trans Formers fans know he sould have died at the hands of Megatron.  I don't understand how a useless Autobot like him ever made it to 2005 (nevermind survive the great war, and live to tell).

I thought actually that it was the episodes where optimus comes back to life, the one where he ends up flying a shuttle through an asteroid field and you think he is going to die again but he ends up saving the day.  I was saddened that it wasn't this episode and I hope that rhino will release that multipart series because it was a great series and a great follow up to the movie but this episope series is OK.  It introduces a ton of new autobots and decepticons and also ushers in the golden age of cybertron.  It is kinda neat to see all the tranformers that they roll out that some of you like me might have bought as a kid.  They could have done more, and they could have put more episodes on it, but above all I wish that it was the episodes that I thought that they were and I hope that by this review other fans will demand that the episodes where optimus is brought back to life will be released, it would be good for fans and good for rhinos buisness.",1018396800,,1113,4.054794520547945
1423130,2,B00005BH20,"After viewing this 3 episode DVD, I was saddened to see the apparent decline of what was once a great series. I grew up in the 80s and was a rabid Transformers fan (and still am) but these three installments were terrible. The story was much too convenient and the characters used were perhaps the weakest of both factions. While to be a true fan, you must take the good with the bad. this compilation was truly the worst.

Somwhere at Rhino there is a horrible horrible error. I do not blame Amazon. This is a distribution problem. Be careful on what you are getting and make sure it is the right DVD.

Not that it's bad, but the voices are totally overpowered by whatever music or sounds are going on in the background throughout all three episodes.  It's almost impossible at times to figure out just what they're saying.  That aside, if you want a great three part set of Transformers eps, this is the place to be.

I had already watched the Transformers  THe Movie DVD , which turned out to be a great flick. My expectations were high.  As the first episode played out  , my jaw dropped ! What was this garbage? The animation was sub-par , and the voice-acting hideous. The only familiar voice was  the Optimus Prime VA , who sounded a little worse for wear.  If you're used to the first season of Transformers , you'll hate these episodes. I mean , the older episodes had way better plot ,storyline and animation.  C'mon , ""NEW HEADMASTERS , NEW TARGERMASTERS!"" . That is the worst promo i've ever heard.  Anyway , I'll quote the main villian to wrap this review  up "" Remove your heads!""

1423153,5,B00005BH20,"This DVD contains the last of the USA Transformers shows, the 3 part 'The Rebirth'. The series ends on a high note, with the Autobots reclaiming Cybertron to it's golden age and many new characters being introduced. But come to think of it, you're most likely a Transformer fan and know that already. You know you want this (even if only for the sake that it's the final episodes). As for this DVD, the menu screen is a bit bland and there are no extras, but there is one thing to crow about.  The episode previews and recaps are included with the 3 episodes! This way you see the shows as they originally aired. I enjoyed this so much as I figured they'd drop them since all three parts are shown back to back. Also each episode is broken into 6 chapters for easy access to your favorite scens within them. The only thing I miss are the intro and outros to commercials, but it probably would've been weird to include them when there are no commercials. Now before rushing off to buy this DVD, remember that Rhino is planning on releasing the entire first season of Transformers in a box set early next year. If it sells well (I'm sure it will), the other seasons will most likely follow. Can you wait for the final series box set to be released? Didn't think so. So pick up this 'Heroes' DVD and enjoy. You won't regret it.",998697600,21,1324,4.3603238866396765
1423154,5,B00005BH20,"I went to Best Buy, my neighborhood Mecca, and saw this in the DVD section and my jaw dropped 20 ft. ""No way!!!"" I have this taped from when I was in 5th grade back in '87, and yes, I still can quote 'em line by line. The Rebirth trilogy was my favorite episodes from the post-movie seasons. This DVD took me back to my childhood. I was in awe, just seeing the Transformers intro again. Man. But anyways...let's move on... =)
This was just a way cool story arc, albeit overly-saturated as  Hasbro was bringing out the new line of Transformer toys and needed a vehicle to advertise all of them. Yes, soo many new characters were introduced and only had about one line each, but hey, you can't blame em. And Headmasters and Targetmasters? How does it all work? How come Arcee's head turns into Daniel's huge white exosuit? And since when did Spike get so dang smart to make all these technical modifications?! Hehe, just kiddin, enough nitpicking here for nitpicking's sake... =)
Now for the good part, tell Swoop good part. Well this 3 part story arc was a good way of ending the series' run in America, it does restore Cybertron to the Golden Age again. And Optimus Prime is back which rocks. The story was definitely more complex than the older episodes. I thought that the writers did a good job with what they had, to integrate all the new characters. The plasma energy was an interesting plot idea, teaching us more about the past of Cybertron, and Vector Sigma. There is a lot of action, which the scenes were well done. The music fit perfectly in all the scenes with a new soundtrack for this miniseries instead of the usual sets of tracks that the shows recycle over and over again. I could watch it over and over again. And Headmasters and Targetmasters? Pretty darn cool. Action. Yes. Very nice.
The DVD itself only includes the feature 3 episodes. But the audio and video quality is very good. I watched it on my big screen and sound system, and it rocked! A must buy for any Transformers fan!!!",996451200,11,2005,4.493150684931507

Complete with scenes from the past episodes of the episode Rebirth and the future episodes of Rebirth from the cool narrator, this DVD is a must.  This is the final episode ever shown in the United States of this classic show.  One comment I would like to make.  I do not like the choice of pictures that Rhino uses for this DVD or the Villians DVD.  On the villians cover it shows Cyclonus, well he was never in the episode The Ultimate Doom except as his prior form ((Skywarp) I have a good theory about why Cyclonus is Skywarp due to Transformers the Movie's vague error that has haunted Transformer fans for years).  The hero's DVD version has Optimus Prime but he is not the main focus of this episode.  Other than that the Rebirth is digitalized and the three part episode looks better than ever.
