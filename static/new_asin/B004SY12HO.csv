Kim Nam Gil is just wonderful in this.  Hope he makes more soon.  Just had to have this, so got it here on Amazon.",1339632000,2,255,3.581818181818182
8440304,4,B004SY12HO,"I like the twist of the story and the male lead character.  I can deeply feel how about his emotions through his facial expressions especially his eyes.  But the ending is ""crazy.""  What was that?  No clear vision of what happened, bad people like the mother and the youngest daughter made their ways?  The title must be ""Bad Luck"" not ""Bad Boy!""",1336953600,3,346,4.516129032258065
8440305,3,B004SY12HO,"I had previously watched MY PRINCESS (another Korean Drama) and I just loved it.  I was disappointed with this Korean Drama, but honestly kept watching it because I just wanted to see who would end up with whom.

I'm not going to give the ending away, but UGH!  Terrible ending!

The acting IS suberb, but it was just too dark a series for me.",1315180800,2,343,4.3125
8440306,5,B004SY12HO,"I'm only a few episodes in, but the acting, plot, sub-plots, cinematography, music -- everything is outstanding.

Where's the Blu-ray version (with English subtitles)?",1313798400,3,167,5.958333333333333
8440307,5,B004SY12HO,"I watched this serial on hulu and the acting of Kim Nam Gil is superb. The production was rushed because he had to go to the military and the ending was lacking. However! It is still one of the best Korean dramas I watched so far.

Lead actresses are brilliant as well. The music and the use of the camera to show false and real, the setting, the interplay of emotions, everything is moving and haunting.",1312588800,4,404,4.315789473684211
