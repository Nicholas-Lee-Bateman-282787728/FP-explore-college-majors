3529180,5,B001DF67ZS,"This movie is APPROPRIATE for these times and for today's generation. No disrespect to anyone, but people can become so TRADITIONAL and/or RELIGIOUS that they overlook that God reaches people at their level. Most importantly, He chooses who he wants to PREACH, TEACH, ET CETERA.

Lastly, just a few questions to leave in response to Angelika Castellaw's  review:

Should the movie lose its authenticity because there were ""secular"" actors in it???

How do you know God was not dealing with the actors on their soul salvation, while speaking to the audience???

You know that life is comprised events planned and unplanned, so can you say for sure you know how you would respond to a person/situation at all times???",1228867200,2,715,4.974789915966387
3529181,5,B001DF67ZS,Pay no mind to the other review that is negative. Preaching God's word has a price and their are trials you go through. Real Preachers are made up of broken down losers that the world spits at.,1227225600,3,193,4.243243243243243

3529189,4,B001DF67ZS,"I'm a HUGE Ving Rhames fan! I've seen him play a drag queen, thug, ruthless boxer and many more characters. He is a true actor because he is not afraid to take his career to the next level by taking on a multitude of characters.

Saving God, Mr. Armstrong Cane just released from a 15 year bid upstate. Life has changed for him drastically, from the streets to the pulpit. His true goal is bringing people to God from all walks of life. He thinks his first assignment is to restore his fathers church and bring in the people. However, God gave him another assignment, to help Norris a small time street thug regain his life. Very good story!

If you are looking for another drama of this sort check out Cuba Gooding Jr in Life as a King, it's based on a true story.",1420675200,,765,4.268965517241379

3529191,5,B001DF67ZS,"I bought this movie because Ving Rhames starred. Ving plays a Pastor. Pastor done something in his pass but was saved and born again. He goes back to his old neighborhood, where drugs are being sold by his late father's Church. Pastor meets this older teenager boy and wants to help him get out of his drug selling job but his boss (Dealer King) has something to say about it. Good story, some action, intense scenes, a twist at the end.",1416096000,2,437,4.407407407407407

3529193,5,B001DF67ZS,"Excellent faith moving film!  I agree - ignore the negative commentary.  My husband and I pastor a church and we only watch Christian films and programming.  Ving Rhames performance was truly convincing to the point that if I didn't know that he was acting, I wouldn't know.  In addition, I truly appreciate Mr. Rhames's frame of mind and the commentary he gave concerning making the film and his humbleness of heart and spirit.  Mr. Rhames, if you read this, please act in more Christian films and God bless the entire group of actors/actresses, producers and everyone that was involved in the creation of this project including the script writer.  The Lord Jesus Christ meant for this film to be made.  Who has an opportunity to present a script to a veteran actor at an airport who takes it seriously?",1411862400,,804,4.741007194244604

3529197,5,B001DF67ZS,"I was familiar with only a single name in the cast or crew, but I
thought they did an excellent job. It's hard for citizens of Pleasant
Valley to understand the hood and the mentality of the hoods who dwell
there. This movie brought that environment to life. Was it totally
accurate in its portrayal? I can't say for sure, but I'm willing to go
out on a limb and state that it is not totally inaccurate. The powerful
raw emotion of a man of God wanting to fight evil with evil and backing
off just before crossing the line was gripping. This is one of the best
Christian films I've seen for a while. Kudos to Cloud Ten Pictures and Andre Van Heerden for producing this gem.",1378339200,,673,4.265625

3529201,1,B001DF67ZS,"predicable is the kindest thing that can be said about this movie. I can see why Christians will line up to see this movie and all power to them but cinematically the bad guys are unbelievable and the good guys are cardboard cut outs of real people. As far as a story of redemption goes this has more in common with Hansel and Gretal than real life. This film is sanctimoneous in it delivery, presumptive in it's attitude and arrogant toward real hardship. You will likely need God's strength to get through 102 minutes of this religious propoganda.",1366761600,,549,4.612244897959184

3529207,4,B001DF67ZS,"I was initially reluctant to watch this - because often movies of this genre miss the mark in terms of true balance between pure scripture and real life.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I found the dialogue interesting and the varied character representations realistic.  The characters were all inter-connected in a way such that no one's life was truly only their own - proving that no man is an island.  It is a story of love, forgiveness and hope that all who desire to live anew in Christ can.  I knew at the end that Blaze would die and John James would live.",1339200000,,563,4.480392156862745
3529208,4,B001DF67ZS,"Wonderfully inspirational. Ving Rhames is most powerful. A man's man and a woman""s protector. Great story of redemption and survival. He is truly God's everyday hero! Great for teens and all adults. Youth leaders would love this movie. It really ministers and helps redirect a person's future.",1331596800,,293,5.25531914893617
3529209,5,B001DF67ZS,"My husband and I both enjoyed this movie. Number One reason is CONTENT. Number 2 is no cursing. This moving had both action and emotion tied in. It
is worth taking time out of your busy schedule to see this. It is very
encouraging to see how God can change a person. I really don't know if it would be a useful tool for salvation but I think that even those who are not christians will enjoy this. It is not ""in your face preaching. It is just watching one man who did something bad in the past -how he and God changed his life--how God used him to change someone else's life.
As a christian -it was VERY ENCOURAGING.
I do think that it is for children under 12 maybe 13 --just depends on how mature they are.
This movie is something like you could see happen in today's times.
I love the part where Pastor Cane questions the other pastor about ""knowing"" the parishners--about is he just up there preaching for the money and what he can get and selling God or is he really trying to make a difference in the people--is he available when someone in his church is hurting and needs comfort or prayer or just to talk. I think this movie hits on a lot of little things that goes on and needs to be ""brought out into the open.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie!!
It is extremly nice to see a christian movie that has good acting and believable people",1331424000,,1341,4.221789883268483

3529221,5,B001DF67ZS,"If you wanted to see a movie that had every aspect of Christianity, then this is the movie.  You get a chance to see true forgiveness, prosperity preaching, sheparding, conversion, commitment, how choices you make have an effect on you, and the working of God revealed all over it.  Indeed the writer of this movie had the Holy Spirit sit right next to him when He wrote this movie. It is every day life as we know it.

If you want a feel good ending this may not be the movie for you.  However, if you understnd your relationship with God and want it to be validated, this movie not only does that but continues to challenge your inner soul.

I have seen the movie six times and have shown it in ministry groups at church.  Everyone who has seen this movie has rated it A+. Each time I watched it I picked up something that I had missed before.  It cuts right through to your soul.  The Harvest is plenitful but the laborers are few.

One of the best Christian reality movies and totally relevant for today.",1262476800,,1008,4.319148936170213

3529247,5,B001DF67ZS,"We recently purchased this movie. ""Saving God"" is well worth watching. It sends an excellent message of God's forgiveness - even for the most horrific sins - provided we are sincere in our repentance. It shows how God can use a redeemed person to change the lives of others for good and how God can turn something meant for bad into something good - just as His Word says. The acting was superb and the characters very believable. The message this movie sent was right on target; I would recommend it for anyone ages teen to adult due to some scary moments that would be too much for younger viewers.

My only complaint about the movie was that it ended too abruptly. I wanted to see more and how God had fully changed the lives of those in the movie. Other than that, I would highly recommend this movie. Good job Cloud Ten Pictures!",1250467200,,834,4.415584415584416
3529248,2,B001DF67ZS,"This movie had some good points and good acting.  They did show how God can turn anyone's life around.  No one is beyond God's Grace.  Yet, where the movie fell flat was the ""Christian couple"" that was friends with Norris and his girlfriend.  They preached it, yet they didn't quite live it.  They weren't married and they were having sex...yet the movie made it seem like it was all right because they were ""faithful"" to each other.  Come on...that's not Biblical.  It could have been a very good movie...but this one point really blew it for me.",1250294400,26,547,4.577319587628866

3529251,4,B001DF67ZS,This movie was very inspirational and promoted hope.  Ving Rhames was excellent in this movie.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs to be encouraged and inspired spiritually.,1237593600,2,179,5.137931034482759
3529252,5,B001DF67ZS,"Saving God is a RARE movie in that it not only has a good story with a great message but the acting is great!  I'm one of those Christians who watches Christian movies with the feeling that I'm being dragged across nails to stand the low budget and poor acting.  Even some of the best ones were difficult in the acting department.

Saving God is a BIG step up from the others.  The story is not a typical little feel good story like many.  It is a story of struggles and not only struggles with non believers but struggles with believers as well.  It doesn't paint a false picture of perfection of those who are saved.  It simply shows the truth which is that we are born sinners who still have struggles and only thrive in the fact that we are made clean by the blood of Christ.

Not only is the story good but the acting is superb.  I couldn't believe I was watching a Christian movie.  Rhames was outstanding to say the least.  No, the other actors aren't up to his level but unlike other Christian films, they are not only tolerable but enjoyable.

In the end there are many messages in Saving God.  I've already used a scene or two for my teaching.  I think there are 10 or so scenes that one could use to show great examples of different views into what is going on in the world today (real life!) and how we should deal with them.

Compared to all movies this would still get a 4 out of 5 stars but as a cheap Christian film it easily gets 5 stars.  I just wonder why there wasn't more advertising on this one.  They really missed their chance to let people know how much they are missing if they don't watch this movie.",1236902400,23,1627,4.213592233009709
3529253,5,B001DF67ZS,"Saving God is an EXCELLENT Christian movie! Please pay attention to the majority of positive reviews and not the narrow-minded reviewer who gave this movie 1 star. Ving Rhames takes a different direction from his typical secular roles and plays an pastor who is also an ex-con working to reach people for Christ in his drug and crime-ridden neighborhood. Your family will enjoy this movie! Our church is showing this movie to our teen audience next week. You will not be disappointed!!

Read my response to the 1-star reviewer:

Wow - I don't think I'd call this review 'old-fashioned', however NAIVE may be a better word? In today's world, ""Saving God"" is more relevant and realistic than ever. In this reviewers world, if a ""Christian"" turns up pregant and unmarried, we all of a sudden have a right to judge her character. As Christians we go through phases in our walk with the Lord and just because we are saved, does not mean that we will never sin again. Thank God that Christians are NOT as perfect as this reviewer. Otherwise, we'd never learn anything. The only thing that stinks is this review. Obviously, this person did not hear Ving Rhames' interview at the end where he had a part in changing the title of the movie from ""Selling God"" to ""Saving God"". The movie, was AWESOME! Too bad, this reviewer missed the entire message.",1236211200,2,1340,4.697872340425532
3529254,5,B001DF67ZS,"I was pleasantly surprised by this moving, realistic movie that has a message that is timely and relevant.  I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that it doesn't matter if a movie has ""secular"" actors.  The term secular has become such a dirty word among so-called Christians.  I am a born again, Bible-Believing Christian myself, but it really saddens me to hear my fellow Brothers & Sisters in the Lord be so narrow and bigoted.

This film is so touching and well made and extremely well acted.  Ving Rhames was also executive producer, so this may be a clue to where is heart really is these days.

Whether you are a believer or not, please give this wonderful film a try!
