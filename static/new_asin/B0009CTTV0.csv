8059111,5,B0009CTTV0,"This was my first piano concert.

My Grandfather was a friend of Cliburn's and we got tickets.

I enjoyed every minute of this, but I must say - when Lazar Berman played ""Moment Musiceaux No. 4"" - it changed the course of my life.

I was not an aficionado of the piano at that time, but Berman's performance that night burned into my mind a passion that I have never experienced before and through my life, since... have used that 'moment' as anchor for my motivation to play.

Today, I'd rather hear Berman play and miss a note or two - than a piece played technically perfect by someone who is... well... not Lazar Berman.",1509235200,,624,4.4

8059115,5,B0009CTTV0,"This is a really nice historic video to have for any lover of piano music since it features some of the world's greatest contemporary pianists live on stage at Carnegie Hall. Each pianist only plays one brief piece, most likely a hand-picked favorite of the artist. The compliation is a fascinating study of different playing styles and various interpretative approaches representing many composers. I wore out my VHS copy from repeated showings to piano literature classes, so am very glad to have the DVD version. Definitely recommended.",1306713600,2,539,5.206896551724138
8059116,5,B0009CTTV0,"This is a great dvd.  NOT a Steinway advertisement.  Now this is obviously a classical piano dvd, so do not expect jazz or pop music (one glance at the dvd cover will tell you this). So many great pianists of a generation right after the ""golden age."" Greats like Rudolf Serkin (the last of the Golden Age), Murray Perahia, Jose Fegahli, Alfred Brendel, and Lazar Berman make this a very exciting performance of piano music.  And the variety of music is a very wide range, Schubert, Liszt, Stravinski, Rachmaninoff, Villa-Lobos, McDowell, etc.  If you don't like classical piano, you probably should not purchase this item! If you do, this is a great purchase for you.",1252972800,3,668,4.782608695652174

8059118,5,B0009CTTV0,"Excellent and interesting DVD. Fascinating to watch the playing styles of so many different, but famous pianists. Should be seen by all piano students!",1189382400,3,151,5.333333333333333
8059119,1,B0009CTTV0,This is just an advertisement for Steinway.  Fifteen different people playing the same music.  Don't waste your time or money on this product.  I wish someone had warned me before I bought this for my father's Christmas present.  The title of this is so misleading.,1166572800,11,265,4.822222222222222
8059120,5,B0009CTTV0,"As in every DVD review, one can spend some time talking about obvious omissions: i.e. who should have played at this event, but didn't.  Van Cliburn hosts, but does not play.  Missing are Martha Argerich, Vladimir Ashkenazy, and many other pianists greater than most pianists who make it onto this DVD.  Who was great?  Surely Josef Hoffman's student, Shura Churassky (spelling?) steals the show.  One can see Maestro S.C. playing in supberb body position using the European weight method against the keys.  His hands appear to massage the keyboards with such beautiful musicianship and technical mastery. Just to view Maestro S.C. playing twice is worth the full price of the DVD.  And add to that the piano play of Murray Perrahia and Alfred Brendl, and one feels happy about the performances, except for the fact that Perahia and Brendl do not play live on stage like Maestro S.C., but from Steinway's basement (M.P.) or Europe (A.B.).  One wonders if M.P.'s and A.B.'s performances are take 4 or 14 of a series of taped takes, but no matter. Both are wonderful to watch.  Incidentaly, I watched A.B. in Chicago this year, and he was wonderful live! I enjoyed watching some of the other minor performers on the DVD (and suffered through others). One had the feeling many of the pianists on stage were there because of good connections with Van Cliburn or other famous or wealthy mentors, instead of their virtuosity and musicianship. Missing were a Martha Argerich, Alicia De LaRoccha, etc.  And why wasn't someone of the caliber of Constance Keene (Chasins) not invited to perform? She's an ignored piano legend and should have been recorded as a tribute to her contributions as a pianist and piano pedagogue in America.  Most annoying was the Brazlian pianists with a Liberace/Lang Lang histrionic performance and a maniacal smile.  But let me apologize to Van Cliburn after initiating controversial teasing comments regarding his choices that evening. Without question Maestro Van Cliburn is a spectacular host with the most beautiful voice imaginable.  And one assumes he excuses himself from performance due to modesty rather than arrogance.  Long billed as an American ambassador of the international musical treasure called ""The Piano,"" Maestrom Van Cliburn orchestrates a wonderful night out.  I enjoyed the histrionic Korean pianist who played MacDowell's Hexentanz.  Not only did she play well, but she was also fun to look at: a kind of Hexen-(witch)-like overweight bombshell in a firecracker red dress (the kind of woman a guy can get into trouble with, suffer miserably, but still remember fondly).  So there's a little bit of everything in this DVD for everyone.  Buy it without hesitation! I own the videotape version and just ordered the DVD today.",1127779200,27,2768,5.072847682119205
