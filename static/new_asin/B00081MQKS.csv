We still have terrible films on the cheap some even worse than this one!.  However, there is one thing that this film did do right--it introduced me to the music of Alexander Borodin and that music has haunted me for all my life.

2256857,4,B00081MQKS,"I have seen a number of reviews of this documentary by ""critics"" who entirely miss the obvious point that this is an historical film, made just as it happened, in 1956. It is not a low-budget dramatic ""science fiction"" film, but an authentic slice of authenticity. After all, aren't we all just ""Strangers in Paradise?"" People who trash this movie do not understand how difficult, and expensive, it was to shoot a multiple-camera documentary on 35 mm film on the 13th moon of Jupiter in 1956 (filmed the year nefore its release), even in black and white. Do you have any appreciation whatsoever for just the cost of shuttling cans of film back and forth from Jupiter's 13th moon to the lab on earth for processing? The fact that you see so little of the film equipment is testimony enough to how polished this cinematic study truly is. Have the courage to hippity hop off your elevated high horses and accept bravura cinema verite in its teething infancy. Certainly this film is also art, but also please have the courtesy to also acknowledge it is also reality also. Would you also put Nanook on ice also?",1271808000,27,1106,4.6479591836734695
2256858,1,B00081MQKS,"There are bad movies and then there are bad movies and then there is ""Fire Maidens"". Wow. This is one of those old sci fi movies that can be fun to watch because it's so bad. There is only about 20 minutes worth of story here but it gets stretched out to 80 minutes. You can imagine how good those extra 60 minutes are.

The plot, such as it is: The 13th moon of Jupiter has been discovered and a group of oily, randy astronauts takes off to explore it. What they find are the remnants of the lost civilization of Atlantis which consists of one very old man and a dozen or so scantily clad young women. What happens the rest of the way is anyone's guess as it gets pretty incoherent and eventually you get to the scene that the movie was made for in the first place: the barely clothed young women dancing around for what seems like days. This movie, while fun if you like bad sci fi, is poorly written, directed and acted, is sexist and mysoginistic and is filled with unlikable male characters and one of the least scary ""monsters"" you will ever see.",1130889600,15,1052,4.26

I have one that is a transfer from a film print, nice but I still wanted to upgrade and maybe get the original trailer too - - but the DVD my friend ordered had part of the picture cut off! - they released this on DVD in Widescreen when it was made in full screen! - The result is cutting the top & bottom of the picture to give the fake effect of 'widescreen'.  After seeing mine, my buddy asked me for a copy of mine!  - Companies that do this don't think the fans will see the difference.  - One reason some old films are released in 'letterbox' when they are really not is because many are 'public domain' and by changing something like screen size, or colorization - - the company can copyright the altered version as a 'new work' and own that version.

The movie is in a wider than 133:1 aspect ratio, but is NOT in color, as the jacket blurb announces; which is no surprise since the film wasn't shot in color. The movie itself is terrible, but still fun to watch. The best way to describe it is to imagine a late fifites ""sex film"" (a movie with a terrible plot, bad acting, and one or two nude scenes thrown in that do not advance the plot) that has had the nude scens removed for a general audience release. That is NOT the history of this film, but if you imagine a world in which this did happen, then this is what the movie would look like. Best remembered for the classic score of Stranger in Paradise being used in it  to it to try to give it class.

2256877,5,B00081MQKS,"Let's start with The Bad:  this is a bad movie.  About as bad as you can imagine.  Cheap budget, bad acting, goofball story, absurdly bad special effects, the works.  It doesn't get much worse than this.

Now, The Good:  actually, it does get worse than this, in that this movie is one of those classics that is so bad, it cycles back around to become wonderful.  I'm a fan of bad movies -- not an indiscriminate fan, but when a bad movie has all the right elements, I can swoon big-time -- and man, I regard this movie as the best of the worst.  Literally, ""Fire Maidens of Outer Space"" is my all-time favorite bad movie.  This is the movie that got me into bad movies, in fact.  I vividly remember that night, back in 1987, watching ""Fire Maidens of Outer Space"" on late-night TV as a teenager, alone in the dark and laughing myself completely silly.  I regard myself as a minor scholar of this movie (what can I say, I'm attracted to obscurities), and I like this movie so much, I not only own an original half-sheet (22x28"") poster for it, but given that this movie hasn't had a proper home-video release in 30 years or more (with the last being a crap-o-vision transfer on VHS), I had even seriously considered investing some personal time and money into starting up a concern with the sole mission of obtaining the rights and an original print, and creating and marketing a proper home-video release.  So Olive Films saved me the effort.  And this is a great transfer, all things considered.  A truly proper home-video release.  Clear, crisp -- a few scratches and pops here and there, but the prints for this film are almost 60 years old, and of all the sources that have crossed my path, I've never seen ""Fire Maidens"" look half as good as this.  Bravo.

And finally, The Ugly (and I say this reluctantly):  this DVD/BD release is in anamorphic 1.66:1, which is narrower than the standard 16:9 widescreen TV aspect ratio.  To accommodate this, there are vertical black bars on the sides, filling in the horizontal gaps.  So far, not a big deal.  I'm a fan of preserving movies' original aspect ratios, so this is great news thus far.  But according to most common sources (including IMDB), this movie was originally shot in academy ratio, which is 4:3, the same aspect ratio as non-widescreen TVs.  Which means, if true, then some of this movie's frame was cropped from the top and/or bottom in order to obtain this 1.66:1 aspect ratio.

I did some video archaeology, seeing that I have two ""public domain"" (i.e., bootleg from broadcast video sources) copies of this movie on DVD -- where I compared stills between this official release and the bootlegs -- and sad to say, on the bootleg broadcast sources, there is slightly more footage on either the top or the bottom of the screen, depending on the scene.  So it appears that in the process of this transfer, some of the vertical image has been cropped.

But you know, while I normally get apoplectic about these types of details, I'm only mentioning it for the sake of being a completist.  In fact, I might even be splitting hairs.  Sometimes films were shot in academy ratio but then matted for projection in a wider aspect ratio, and then the extraneous portion of the frame was retained in video transfers.  Comparing the two, side by side on my computer, there really isn't that much lost, maybe 10% total off the top and/or bottom.  (And to muddle the issue, there is some extra image content in this Olive Films DVD/BD, on the left and/or right edges.  Which means that while we've lost a bit of the top and bottom, we've gained some additional material on the left and right.  This situation could be due entirely to the overscan settings on my TV, for all that I know.)  I have to say, I'm just far too happy, finally being in possession of a good transfer of this movie in a high-quality home-video format that I can call mine, to let such a small issue ruin the fun.

So there you go.  If you like cheesy old sci-fi, or enjoyably bad movies, or Cinema Obscurit, then this high-quality transfer of ""Fire Maidens of Outer Space"" is a find and a half.  Invite over your best-natured friends, have a few drinks, and fire up a late-night viewing.  You can't go wrong.  And if you're caught up in the debate of ""DVD vs Blu-Ray?"" note that there aren't any truly palpable differences between the two versions.  Both have the same dearth of extras, and roughly the same picture and sound quality.  I.e., this is not a movie that takes advantage of the BD format, except for the fact that the BD case takes up fractionally less shelf space, at the cost of fractionally more money.  So what to do?  If you're truly conflicted, I suppose you can always do what I did:  get both.",1394582400,33,4739,4.532391048292109

2256879,3,B00081MQKS,"1956 was the height of the Sci-Fi boom as mutants, flying saucers, giant beings/animals etc. were bombarding movie theatres at a constant clip.  Director Cy Roth's 'FIRE MAIDENS OF OUTER SPACE'-1956 (a British/US co-production) belongs to the lost civilization genre and resembles Director Arthur Hilton's 'CAT WOMEN OF THE MOON'-1953 which would be remade by Director Richard Cunha as 'MISSLE TO THE MOON'-1958.  At least those pot boilers had a bit of logical science in them (a very small bit considering they utilized office furniture in their rocket interior just as these guys do), this film has our heroes romping around the 13th moon of Jupiter without space helmets or suits, they look like they're on vacation in the British country side. They also whip out cigarettes and smoke on board ship and in the atmosphere of the planet giving second hand smoke to the fire maidens.  The less said about the acting, the better.  Director Roth seems to have directed a few war features and television episodes but faded away in the sixties. After this, I can see why.  The film is notable(?) in having most of its music score comprised of Borodin's dances from his opera 'PRINCE IGOR' to allow the fire maidens multiple dance times amidst the screams but emerges as a low grade howl fest as our heroes encounter the remnants of the populace of Atlantis who are at the mercy of a loud annoying monster who resembles something out of the sixties television series 'THE OUTER LIMITS' sporting a small ponytail no less.  If you take the film as it is, it makes a great party film preferably viewed after midnight with lots of alcohol of choice.  Director Edward Bernds would have the last say in the genre with his camp classic 'QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE'-1958.  I viewed the DVD transfer and its the best the film has looked since its release in a 1.85 ratio with crisp black and white images and supposedly has extra footage added (could not figure out what) to bring the running time back to its original 80 minute length making the Blu-Ray transfer solely for nitpicking viewers.  Having last viewed the film in the sixties on a small rabbit eared television, it was refreshing to see Olive Films resurrection of it, unfortunately, its still a sows ear.

Also on the 13th moon of Jupiter is one old codger. Do what the astronauts do, and ignore him.

I love it, even many of the so-called ""bad"" movies that end up as fodder for that bizarre cult know as Misery Science Theater 3000.  And I actually had already purchased this film in a public domain copy distributed by Sinister Cinema.  So I knew what to expect as far the film itself: Ultra-cheap effects, stock footage of rockets, scantily-clad ""alien"" women, a dumb monster, etc.  I love how NO attempt was made to simulate the environment of a alien world (in this case, the 13th moon of Jupiter).  Witness a largely inept crew of spacemen running around with no suits or helmets, a ""monster"" that is just a man in makeup and a black jumpsuit who somehow invokes terror even though his average footspeed for pursuit is on par with that of the mummy.  All these things really don't seem out of place when you stop and realize you're watching a movie called ""Fire Maidens of Outer Space.""

So, you either like this sort of thing, you don't, or you like to make fun of it.  But whatever your reasons, if the film appeals to you, you'll be glad to know that Olive Films has done a fine job of bringing it home.  I haven't done a back-to-back comparison with my Sinister copy, but this release claims to be the ""uncut, 80 minute"" version.  If anyone knows what's different about it, I'd appreciate you letting me know in the comments section.  After all, no one should be expected to watch this turkey two times in a row :-)

Also typical of Olive Films, this DVD is a bare-bones release.  All you get are chapter stops.

Now we have a new problem when a dog chases a car, it has no idea what to do if it catches the car. What do you do with a Fire Maiden? Worse yet, what do the fire maidens have in mind for the naive astronauts? Will there be a hot time on New Atlantis tonight?

Between cat women of the moon and missle to the moon stock rocket footage, lame dialogue, goofy monster and even the fire maidens are just simply below par.

Certainly, this film fits the bill, and probably is somewhere near the top of that category.  I watched it with my friend and enjoyed seeing her enthralled by the bad acting, terrible effects (can't really be referred to as 'special') and amateurish script.  The highlights of this film are found in the artwork of the DVD cover, for that is as good as it gets.  However, if you're like my friend and are a true devotee of schlock, then this film will not disappoint.",1520380800,,581,4.401869158878505

8055260,4,B00081MQKS,"This hilarious ""film"" breaks the laws of Physics to bring you a monster costume so bad it is only shown behind shrubbery or in silhouette, the most awkward kissing ever and pointy brassieres on a moon of Jupiter.  There is too much to describe, so watch the film to see a spaceship interior which looks like an unfinished basement, the worst special effects ever (watch for popcorn and bean bags), and baffling line deliveries!

I do recommend doing something else while watching because the film is quite slow.  I folded laundry and made dinner during, pausing often to laugh.

The best moment (arguably)?  Each member of Mission Command breaking out the cigarettes to celebrate a successful launch!",1518307200,,700,4.948717948717949

8055263,1,B00081MQKS,"There is very little to recommend this film.  Its about on par with Plan 9 From Outer Space, with extremely poor dialogue, crummy transfer quality, and a story that any comic book can improve on.  How did Atlantis get to Jupters Moon?  Where did the indestructible creature come from?  Did I mention the special effects were bad?  The so called fire maidens are a bunch of hot broads left over from Atlantis, that speak English, of course.

The plot: a group of men are launched on a mission to Jupiters 13th moon that has the same atmosphere as earth.  The space vehicle is a German V-2, the same rocket shown in many early science fiction films.  Strangely, the inside of the rocket is spacious, with office chairs to enhance comfort.  After arriving on Jupiters moon the travelers stumble over the civilization of Atlantis,where there are numerous beautiful women and only one old man to look after them.  Wow!  Theres a never before seen story twist.  The tension is supplied by an indestructible monster who is trying to bust down the Atlantian walls and kill off those inside.  The monster appears to be a rather thin fellow smeared with mud.  And there is the obligatory battle between the women over who should lead the gaggle of giggling girls.

Not worth the time.  Avoid at all cost.

Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours. We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between sixteen and nineteen and a half, cut off in this castle with no one to protect us! Oh, it is a lonely life -- bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear.... We are just not used to handsome spacemen.  (with apologies to Monty Python)

If you've ever watched the ""Creature Double Feature"" on UHF TV or appreciate MST3K&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Science-Theater-3000-Volume-1/dp/B00YT9IT2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Science Theater 3000: Volume 1</a>, you'll enjoy just how APPALLINGLY BAD this film is.  Low budget was the rule in this production, as can be seen by the initial set-up about how ""earth like"" the 13th moon of Jupiter is, the use of office equipment for the launch control room, and the high tech pair of levers in the ship control room that have more capabilities than a single control panel on the Starship Enterprise.  All of these endearing special effects, as well as the dime novel plot and Wolf-man Jack 'cameo' as the monster make this cringe-worthy enough for at least one go around.

Mars needed women, New Atlantis needs men.  Volunteers?  Don't forget to bring your Longines Space Watch!",1516060800,,1402,5.4036697247706424

The encounter a rather whacked out king and his 20 daughters. This is not a good movie by any stretch. The script is mediocre, which is actually better than the wooden acting. Mostly, the guys saunter around with no real purpose, the women dance to a speeded up version of Strangers In Paradise (I kid you not), and some kind of creature meanders around for no real purpose except there needs to be one. Normally I'm a big fan of horrible grade Z science fiction, but this one just doesn't cut it on any level",1515715200,2,637,4.361344537815126
