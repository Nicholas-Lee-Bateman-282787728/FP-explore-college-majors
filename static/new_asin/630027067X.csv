This flick ain't one of them.

What's the opposite of timeless? Probably dated or forgettable. Either aptly describes this early 70's dreck. I hate saying that because I'm a huge fan of Alan Arkin; quite literally my favorite actor. And knocking this production is made even more difficult given how incredible he was during this period in his career - '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freebie-and-the-Bean/dp/B002AO004A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freebie and the Bean</a>', '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Seven-Per-Cent-Solution/dp/B005ETAMHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Seven-Per-Cent Solution</a>' and '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-In-Laws/dp/B00008MTY5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The In-Laws</a>' - the man was, and still is, talent defined.

Only a complete misuse of that talent could prevent him from delivering.

So add that adjective to describe this flick - misuse. Of talent, and we, the audience.

Tells the story of a downtrodden and desperately lonely DMV driving course tester, Gunny Rafferty, who bumps into a pair of wandering nomads while taking a lunch break from the monotony of his life. Crude and emotionally damaged runaway Frisbee and older but simple-minded Mac, on the road to help Frisbee (who changes her name every week) finish her novel.

Good natured Rafferty agrees to drive them to the bus station, but the pair take advantage of his generosity by gunpoint - he's going to take them on their total journey whether he wants to or not. And despite escaping the 'twins', he's intrigued by their carefree spontaneous lifestyle and so chooses to rejoin the pair. The trio's final destination - New Orleans by way via a circuitous route including Las Vegas and various backwater towns; and a plot filled with one stumbling contrived predictable event after another.

The sole saving grace, despite the incompetence of Director Dick Richards, the group of actors somehow persevere and find some way of bonding, of forming an irregular on-screen family unit of sorts. The same way soldiers from different backgrounds join together to get through a terrible experience. There's a sense of survival from the trio - not as their characters, but as performers who recognize the crap they find themselves in.

Disappointingly flat and plodding road picture. The only reason I even finished the film was to extract the full value of the rental fee.",1344902400,,2819,5.8585365853658535
7807981,4,630027067X,"On a back shelf in a hippie style book store i came accross this film. Reading the back of the box sparked my curiousity. Yes, this movie has some very funny moments, but i believe there to be some strong messages in this film about being alone, and how vulnerable we are to be needed in the world. All three main characters are alone in life, and they meet many bizarre characters on their road trip that are as alone and troubled as they are. I won't spoil anything, but there is a nerdy small town teenager who shows up in the film who has a horribley funny line about 'Grape Fruits'. This is a rare film, and probably will never get the recognition it deserves.",1073520000,11,665,4.285714285714286
