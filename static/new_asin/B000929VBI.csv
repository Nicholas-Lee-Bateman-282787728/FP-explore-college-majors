8056704,5,B000929VBI,"I also contacted A.D. Vision and they confirm they don't have permissions, but may try to get some in the future. Not all hope is lost after all. Their exect mesage:

""We do not have permissions for additional episodes for Saint

Seiya.  Hopefully we can obtain more in the future.""",1129680000,2,282,4.6
8056705,5,B000929VBI,"Okay ADV told me that indeed they do not have permission to release any more saint seiya episodes, but, fans can help out by contacting ""Toei"". Toei is the one that grants permission to release saint seiya dvd's. So please everyone email them, they have a website you can log on (I am not sure of the URL but you can google it). please people probably all of you spent lots of money gettign the 12 volumes of an UNFINISHED saga. and if this works out who knows we might even get the Hades saga and even better we might get the Zeus saga. please email them PLEASE not just for you but for everyone who is a true fan of saint seiya.

8056706,5,B000929VBI,"I have contacted ADV films, and they told me that within the next couple months they will have information as far as whether the rest of Saint Seiya will be released.

It is really great to have the complete collection(Totally 127 episodes, also 4 movies and two vols of gold saints legends before and after the Hades chapter)

This anime is worth collecting!!!!!!",1126742400,6,364,4.761904761904762
8056707,5,B000929VBI,"according to ADV they do plan to release a volume 13 in the future. However, they are still unsure of how much longer we must wait for future chapters of saint seiya. I can only hope they realease them fast, at least the whole sanctuary series.",1125792000,4,244,4.326086956521739
8056708,5,B000929VBI,"How is it possible that ADV does not plan to realease anymore episodes of this amazing series?! I still can't believe when I heard that this might be the last volume produced by ADV. I have been buying these volumes believing that in the end I would have my complete collection of Saint Seiya, but after what I've heard, I am so mad at ADV. How can they just stop at episode 60? If ADV doesn't produce any more Saint Seiya volumes, than all they've done is not just waste my money, but every other Saint Seiya fan's money as well . ADV has really sunk itself low by not producing anymore of these volumes. What a dissapointment!!",1123027200,6,629,4.338983050847458
8056709,5,B000929VBI,"In volume 12 we finally arrive at the house of Virgo. In this house we see one of the most memorable battles of the entire Sanctuary saga. The series just keeps getting more and more intense the closer we get to the final fight.

  With 5 episodes on each disc, a great dub and no editing I have been very impressed with ADV's handling of this classic series. However, it now seems that this might be the final volume. How can they lead us on for 12 volumes and then ditch us a few episodes before any sort of closure.

  I'd recommend this series to just about anyone, especially due to the low price and the overall great treatment, however if they don't finish off the series then I'd say just get the japanese or HK dvds because there's nothing worse than being ditched a few episodes before the end. So e mail ADV and let them know.",1122076800,8,837,4.265822784810126
8056710,5,B000929VBI,"After no word on vol. 13 after almost 3 months, I've recently discovered on various fan sites that ADV only apparently planned on releasing 12 volumes??? Only through episode 60?? C'MON! There are only 14 episodes left for the Sanctuary Saga (either 3 more volumes, or 2 DVDs w/ 7 eps each). At least they could finish that, if they can't go on to do the Asgard & Poseidon sagas, (26 eps & 15 eps resp.) which would take up another 8 volumes. SO contact ADV if you want more Seiya, ESPECIALLY the last 14 episodes of Sanctuary.

I've been SO happy with this version, I can't see it just end like this. The voices and translations are GREAT, as opposed to the blasphemous butcher-job that was ""Knights of the Zodiac"".

After taking almost 20 years to find its way to America's shores in a translated version, Seiya (and its fans) DESERVE the respect of at LEAST ONE complete saga.",1121472000,5,879,4.4875
8056711,5,B000929VBI,"I love this series, especially the battle in the house of virgo, it just shows you how powerful the gold saints are, especially the saint closest to the gods, Shaka, in this volume you see the bronze saints struggle even ikki himself, and in the end of the battle against virgo it will surprise you if you haven't seen the series, besides the whole ambient and mythical cosmos of virgo is greatly shown in his attacks, besides when they briefly get to the house of libra it's one of those slow episodes, but hey is what makes the series soo great!",1117584000,,547,4.425742574257426
