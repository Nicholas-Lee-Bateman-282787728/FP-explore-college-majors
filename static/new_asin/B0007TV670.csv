If you are a fan, you have to get it...I was born in 1960, so I have never seen these episodes or even knew they existed ever. I wish my parents were still alive so we could watch them together, because I know they would have enjoyed them.",1176163200,,325,3.9393939393939394
2244072,4,B0007TV670,"I started watching Johnny Carson  with my parents when I was 5, and as a kid rarely missed it.  I loved it as well as an adult. When I heard about these found tapes, I knew I had to see them. They are great fun to watch. You really do see in his early skits the traits that later made him such a master of comedy.  You also get a feel for the culture at the time. There very little political comment, which was probably wise considering the McCarthy era.  The skits and jokes were tame by our standards now, but watching this was still great fun.",1175990400,,546,4.074766355140187
2244073,5,B0007TV670,"This is a fascinating slice of TV history and a chance to see the great Johnny Carson in his early days.  I'm glad this material survived and was released on DVD with such care, five decades later.  Thanks, Shout! Factory.",1172448000,6,222,4.525
2244074,1,B0007TV670,"As a serious collector of old-time radio programs, I have literally hundreds of programs dating as far back as the early 30's.  99.9% plus of the programs in my collection are complete and intact, virtually all with original commercials.  I thought when ordering these ""ten episodes"" of the ""Johnny Carson Show"" from the 1955-56 season I would be getting a genuine piece of classic television history.  Instead, I received a patchwork of skits pieced together by some inane editor who decided to pick and choose  among skits meeting his own personal criteria, rather than presenting us with the total, genuine, virgin article.  In no way can these be described as complete ""episodes.""  As far as being a useful piece of television history, this collection is essentially worthless.  I have vowed never again to be duped by the company that gave us this product and will never order anything produced by them in the future.",1172275200,27,922,4.9480519480519485
2244075,1,B0007TV670,"There is another dvd titled ""Here Is The Johnny Carson Show"". That's the one you need to buy, NOT THIS ONE! This disc contains only 2 episodes of ""The Johnny Carson Show"". The other disc contains these episodes PLUS an episode of ""Who Do You Trust"" and ""The Jack Benny Program"" (guest starring Johnny), and 2 Budweiser promo films that Johnny and the gang made in 1972 on the Tonight Show set. What's more the other disc is cheaper. BTW, the audio and video quality is very good on the other disc, too. If you liked Johnny or early live television, then BUY IT!! I really enjoyed it.",1116201600,44,583,4.407407407407407

8051700,4,B0007TV670,"A great look back at the King of Late Night's career.  This is a very young, slim, and funny Johnny.  However, most will enjoy him more in The Tonight Show setting, and I think the Ultimate Collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Johnny-Carson-Collection-His-Favorite-Moments-from-The-Tonight-Show-Vols-1-3-1962-1992/dp/B000068WS7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Johnny Carson Collection - His Favorite Moments from The Tonight Show (Vols. 1-3) (1962-1992)</a>is the best of the many great sets available.

8051701,4,B0007TV670,"I have followed the career of Johnny Carson from ""Who do you Trust"" to his last appearance on David Letterman. I was not aware of the show he did called ""The Johnny Carson Show."" The Golden Age of Television was the place where millions of viewers became exposed to great talent. Non greater than Johnny Carson. I live in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, the place where Johnny, Ed and the Tonight Show team came to develop the Tonight Show. I have listened to many stories of the time they were here and wondered where many of the shows elements came from. I now know. Johnny's work on the DVD's I've just seen is the foundation of over thirty years of the greatest programs ever broadcast. His wisdom of keeping these tapes was pure genius. Thank you Mrs. Carson for sharing this adventure with us.",1180656000,,792,4.545454545454546
8051702,5,B0007TV670,"I guess I didn't realize it would not be the Tonight show but the first shows he did.

They are a little on the boring side.  But interesting to see how he 'evolved' in the entertainment part.",1179187200,,192,4.162162162162162
