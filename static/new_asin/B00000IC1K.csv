7910220,5,B00000IC1K,"Speaking on behalf of the entire series, and not just the Volume One, let me say that AIC produced a real gem here.

At first glance it might be hard to imagine how enthralling an anime about sports could be. The revealing sportswear the characters wear (Legs clearly visible from top to bottom) might give you the impression that the studio intended on using eye candy as a substitute for an engaging narrative. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is a general consensus in the reviews you read here that one of Battle Athletes' most positive features is its Character Development. There is plenty to be had.

The first volume begins by establishing who the characters are, their relationship to each other, and what their ultimate goals are. It is relatively light hearted. A lot of the English voice actors will probably be familiar to you; VA Cameos from Cowboy Bebop and Outlaw Star most notably. So I was fairly impressed by the voice casting and how they handled the characters. So if you haven't watched the Japanese version, you'll probably be satisfied. Akari might take a bit to adjust to though ;)

The language can involve some mild swearing but it's sparse (Read: Not Overused) and in 2012 where things are often subject to censorship or substituted stilted language like ""Darn it,"" I found it relatively refreshing.

Once we roll into Volume 2 we start to see where the emotional part of the journey begins. The conflict between Friendship and Self Interest is played out skillfully. And it snowballs from there. You'll be surprised what happens to the characters, how they deal with the challenges that lay ahead of them, and how easy it is to feel concerned for them (Or at least I hope you will, ^__^)

Oh, and a great bonus to these DVD's is that once you ""Play all,"" it plays the Opening credits once and you won't see the ending credits until it's played through every single episode. How cool is that? No pause in the action for a silly 3 minute opening/ending cutscene. And the previews don't start until after the ending credits. This was a great idea and I've not seen anything similar to it.

CONS...?

If I had to level some criticisms against it... I would say that towards the end there is a poorly handled romance that feels a bit contrived for comedy but ultimately looks like it'll create some trouble.

Volume 7 contains what would have been an okay way to end the series but for better or worse we get a subplot that was briefly hinted at earlier in the series. It does have the benefit of bringing together some characters for an interesting spectacle.

IN CONCLUSION:

If you're looking for a very delightful anime to add to your collection and you can find this for a good price, I strongly recommend you give Battle Athletes Victory a shot. Hope my review wasn't too vague, but going into something with as few expectations as possible can make your experience that much better. =)",1348444800,,2930,4.660852713178294
7910221,5,B00000IC1K,"The slapstick violence, the ridiculous back story, and the development of the characters bring entertainment to the sports anime genre that can be too serious at times.  This series concentrates on the virtue of the fun of competition and not on just winning all the time.  This theme plays out time and again in this series where all competitors who try to win at any cost and by any means are defeated.  At first glance this may seem like a sports anime, but it actually is more about having fun and enjoying friendship.",1331078400,,522,4.591397849462366
7910222,4,B00000IC1K,"I didn't know exactly what to expect when I picked up this title. I've heard bits and pieces about it from various sources but I didn't have a clear picture of what it would be like. I'm happy to say this is one of the most entertaining series I've had the pleasure to watch in a while. It has a good mix of action and comedy which had me chuckling out loud quite often. The only thing I didn't like was the opening song which was too cheesy for me, but after that it was all great. The animation is decent and the background music for the action scenes were good enough. It's only the beginning but I'm definitely looking forward to what will happen next!",1129680000,,656,4.214285714285714
7910223,5,B00000IC1K,"I wasn't expecting much out of this series.  It looks like a show for little girls, but some of the cursing means I wouldn't let an 8 year old watch it.  There is a lot of depth in this series, especially in later discs.  I was actually quite impressed with the subjects the series raised and how the series dealt with these issues.  Also, its very funny and the pacing is excellent.  I never felt like I was slogging through any sections, even though Akari can get a little annoying in these early episodes.
This series is so underrated and definitely a steal for the DVD price.",1004400000,2,579,4.373831775700935
7910224,5,B00000IC1K,"The first 10 episodes (or 3 DVDs) of this anime tv series take place before the original Battle Athletes OAV (original animated video). These episodes set up the whole premise of going to the University Satellite, and the struggle to get there. Long story short it is very good. Worthy of watching, if for nothing else to see the sports drama. There is a slight lesbian sexual undertone, but that does not detract from the main story. One of the best things about this DVD is the dubbed version of the show. Sure they add profanity to a script that had little to no profanity before, but the diversity of the voices that is used is outstanding. The only draw-back that the DVD has is that the production company grouped all the episodes together taking out the Opening and Closing sequence/theme and the previews for the next episode. This series should be a must for any collector, and at the low price of only $16 a disc, what is stopping you from buying it.",987033600,3,960,4.522988505747127
7910225,3,B00000IC1K,"This show is great, don't get me wrong, but there were some things that caught me.  One was the whole lesbian undertones.  Now I read something  that says that there is no romance, boy were they wrong.  While nothing  happens some girls get hit on by other girls.  Also the language is  actually worse in the dub than the sub!  Usually it is the other way  around, but this time the girls are swearing in english!
The show is  cute, but alot of things hold it back from being a child or pre-teen safe  show.  I mean there are some great things on friendship, but they can get  over looked because some character starts yelling ""S#!T"".  I  would recommend it, but it really doesn't get it's target audience with the  swearing and other content.",967161600,4,743,4.432835820895522
7910226,5,B00000IC1K,"i LOVED this show!  it was a million times better then i expected. i loved the humor and the characters (my fave was definitely the chinese girl, ling-pha, she is soo funny!) also i agree with the other reviews that this  is deeper then it looks! it really says something about competetition in  our society. i think that, along with ""lain"", this is the best  anime dvd release this year!  go get it; you won't regret a minute!  <g>",945216000,6,432,4.405063291139241
7910227,5,B00000IC1K,"""Battle Athletes Victory"", or Daiundokai, is truly an amazing series in disguise.  Although the character lineup and artwork point to another ""see it for the Half Naked Girls"" type series, the story  is actually quite deep and the character developement is one of the best  I've seen.  Laugh, cry, and cheer these very human stars as they develope  their own personalities and traits.  The characters are readily  identifiable from each other, though the humor may be slightly a bit too  politically incorrect.  The only flaw with the English Dubbed version  involves inadequate voice casting.  The english dubbers miss cues,  improvise, Over Americanize and even use profanity (there is none in the  original script).  If you want the best experience the script has to offer,  watch the subtitles only, and leave the voices in Japanese, this makes it  slightly inconvenient but a much better experience.",938476800,9,904,5.173611111111111
7910228,5,B00000IC1K,"Even though the box art and the character design may lead you to believe that this may be one of those ""cute girls being happy and giggly then its over"" kind of anime that we have seen gazillion times.  Well, it  is.  At least in first volume that is.  But trust me, if you continue to  watch the series and get to know the characters better, then this series  will grow on you.  In fact, between all those silly comedies, there are  powerfully emontional scenes that may actually move the audience.  I did,  and I am not the type who normally get moved by anime, or any type of  films.  Character development has been seriously lacking in anime these  days, but Battle Atheletes is one of few exceptions.  Anyway, if you like  anime series, by any means go check it out.  It is my favorite since  Revolutionary Girl Utena.  P.S. I want to mention that this series contains  lesbian subtext (it gets more deliberate by the fourth volume).  Nothing  explicit, but this might bother someone (or interest someone).",933552000,11,1011,4.567415730337078
