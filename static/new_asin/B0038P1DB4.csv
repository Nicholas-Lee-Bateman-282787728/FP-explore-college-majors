8581255,3,B0038P1DB4,"Written and Directed by: Thunder Levin.

Really enjoyable fright flick with some laughs,Very much like ZOMBIELAND.

Feels like a Blaxploitation rift by a Tarantino or Fred Williamson.

Enjoyed the Urban feel when seems most typres of these films take place in a small town or remote,These sets ARE NOT out of the way,'You are Knee Deep In URBAN DECAY !'

More than adequate cast including -C. Thomas Howell ( Asylum Studios alum nowadays) and GregAlan Williams ( From BAYWATCH tv) and Johanna Watts ( Soon to be be seen in AMERICAN BATTLESHIP) brings a realness into a Mutant,Vampire& Zombie environ.

Sound track was pretty good with VITAL,Doing most of the soundtrack justice.

Some nice lines of dialogue  and some borrowed to great effect.",1327449600,,743,4.991869918699187
8581256,4,B0038P1DB4,"Occasionally I'll watch a zombie movie these days, but with eight billion zombie films both from Hollywood and independent studios, most are crap.  You know the genre is in trouble when George Romero can't even save it with his recent films.  In fact, I think there should be a Hollywood law put into effect that no zombie films can be produced for at least a decade.  Money talks though.
Oddly enough you get one that ends up being quite entertaining.  I guess that's not so surprising considering the number of films, a few have to be watchable.  Mutant Vampire Zombies From The Hood, based on it's title alone would indicate that you're dealing with something on the level of Zombie Nation.  But try watching this movie and you'll see it seems like Romero's finest hour compared to that film.
This movie really offers nothing new that hasn't been touched upon in any other zombie film, yet(for me anyway) it was extremely watchable.  Basically you have a group of bitter enemies(cops and rival Black and Asian gangs) who have to put a halt on their vendettas when the big zombie plague hits(this time because of a solar flare).  They band together and make a trek to the home of a scientist and his daughter who have an escape plan under way.
What can I say, I liked it!  Yeah, it's unoriginal and has a home movie look to it, as well as that horrendous CGI gore at times, but I never found myself looking at the clock.  Maybe it was the characters and the unlikely alliance of gang members and a cop that did it for me, I'm not sure.  Maybe it's coz I like C. Thomas Howell and was wondering how the hell he ended up in a film with this title.  Speaking of the title, as campy sounding as it is, the movie doesn't play itself out as a comedy.  Sure it has some chuckles, but it's tone is a bit more serious than expected.  The odd title also refers to the fact that throughout the course of the movie, the monsters are referred to as ""vampires"" at first, then ""zombies"" and ""mutants"" later.  And of course they are in the 'hood.
A pleasant surprise.",1317427200,,2053,4.422872340425532
8581257,1,B0038P1DB4,"I must admit, When I saw the cover and who was in this movie I thought it would be better. I was a little dissapionted on the quality of the movie it looked like it was shot on a home video camera and the acting was horrible. A lot of times through out the film they barely showed the zombies faces.",1282608000,2,299,3.918032786885246
8581258,5,B0038P1DB4,thank you amazon for this movie my son love them zombie movies and me too they are funny thank you again amazon elizabeth,1281916800,,121,4.304347826086956
8581259,5,B0038P1DB4,This movie is definitely worth watching I thought it wouldn't be that good but I would watch it again. I would recommend this movie to a friend.,1267747200,4,144,4.37037037037037
8581260,5,B0038P1DB4,This is actually a very funny movie for an independant film. The make up and effects where high quality it wasn't cheesy or unprofessional. This isn't a regualr zombie movie the zombies had a big twist I've never seen in any other zombie movie. This might also be one of the only scary movies where the black guy doesn't die. I give it two thumbs up.,1267056000,5,350,4.318181818181818
