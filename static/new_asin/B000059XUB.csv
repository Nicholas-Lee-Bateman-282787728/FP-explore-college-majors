1409568,4,B000059XUB,"John Liu and Wang Tao team up again as the southern fist and norther leg connection.  The two heroes meet as enemies first until they realize they both have the same agenda, the evil ching lord played by the amazing Han Ying and his deadly mantis style.  After some minor battles with the ching warriors and also each other.  Finally the two men join forces and attempt to take down Han Ying before it's too late.  Amazing choreography, and Liu and Tao are again a great team.  Han Ying is a masterful villian, and the final confrontation is worth it.  A must see.",988502400,2,564,4.427184466019417
1409569,4,B000059XUB,"Some good footworks that will leave you dumbfounded. Wang Tao(southern fists) and John Liu(northern kicks) were spectacular. Although there were times that they looked for the lamest excuse to fight, the movie in general is the bum!!. A must see for traditional martial arts afficionados.",985219200,,288,5.4222222222222225
1409570,4,B000059XUB,"This is the best film with Wang Tao and John Liu together. It has some good fighting scenes. Very good footwork by John Liu. I always liked this film when I was a kid, and have seen it dubbed in three different languages. The bad guy (Han Yin) was superb. Great music too, taken from the Clint Eastwood Western ""Hang 'em High"".I don't know about the DVD quality, but I would recommend this film to anyone. Also check out ""Secret Rivals"" with this duo.",981590400,3,451,4.380952380952381

1409587,1,B000059XUB,"I watched 10 minutes of it & could not continue. This film was dubbed in English, but the sound & speech quality was so bad I could not hear half of what is being said. It appears a few of the actors  have really sound kung-fu foundation, however none of them are known actors or pleasant to watch.",1457222400,,298,4.137931034482759

1409620,5,B000059XUB,"whooo...i never expected the flick was going to be great....the storyline is about the ching dynasty tyring to go to taiwan to kill general cheng from the ming dynasty.  However the plan was cut short when the prince of the ching dynasty was assasinated by one of the mings guards(wong)....the general assigned eagle (white haired guy) on taking charge with the military and to go after wong.
On the other hand, Liu is a wanderer who take his skills to the test against wong.  At first he does not have any side to anyone until he found the secret of the necklace worn by a beautiful japanese lady who looks after wong.  There is a good twist on the story during this part.

Ok the action is off the chain...liu is a really good kicker.  He shows combination of side, front, and round flying kicks.  He also does a great high flying power kick.  His a versatile fighter because his great at both arm and leg combat and it is the same case for the villain eagle.  Both of them really shines and delivers a raw martial art battle with no wire but pure martial arts creative demonstration.  As far as for wong, his fighting skills are limited to the arm.  Wong barely uses his legs making him vulnerable from the high front downward kick by eagle.  However, wong does manage to do a high flying kick but only a few time.  The final fight scene is just outstanding for a good classic kung fu film....very creatively done.

I also want to mention about the great coountryside of which this movie takes place, showing great view of mountains and rivers during fights.

The sound is great and the picture is alright which comes in full screen.  If u interested on great classic kung fu film then u should definetely give this movie a shot, im glad i did thats why i give this movie a grade of 4.5/5  enjoy!",1171497600,,1799,4.422492401215806
1409621,1,B000059XUB,"First of all, it's english dubbing. Not japanese language. Subtitle is not available.

The worst is bad transformation from (whatever format) to DVD. Just bad DVD.. i wish never purchased this DVD. Bad Bad Bad Bad DVD...",1150675200,,220,4.945945945945946
1409622,4,B000059XUB,"The fighting scenes awesome.  I'm talking about the guy with the tremendous kicking and splitting abilities.  If you want to see a guy wax the behind of his enemies while being doubled and trippled teamed by splitting and kicking - well this is the flick for you.  In my opinion this guy is the real star of this flick.  He brings the real energy here.  I'm telling you his kicks are devestating! No swords, no knives, no partners - NO PROBLEM!

The other guy ((Lo Lieh), he was a little lame throughout but in the end when he teamed up with the leg fighter to beat up the classic white haired villan he seemed to come alive.  The plot is there - at least it has one!  This is a must see classic for all old school Kung Fu fans.

The last fighting scene was totally awesome as well as a bit funny to me.  There's nothing like a flying punch in your face unawares!  I'm glad they brought this one to DVD!",1125014400,,903,4.161849710982659

1409624,5,B000059XUB,"This is  one action packed movie filled with great fighting the perfomance of john liu is of the hook he can kick and stretch like crazy. Also tao tao ling and the main villian is awesome, the ending fight scene goes on forever something like twenty and some minutes. The end is worth the price of the dvd alone so if you want a action packed movie with not that much of a plot get this movie right now or you will be kicking yourself later on when you get it.",1000944000,2,460,4.054945054945055

7934253,5,B000059XUB,"There are run of the mill kung fu flicks that's just trying to keep up & there's the ones that stand out above the rest. This is the latter & not the former. Wong Tao is awesome as the Southern patriot doing his part to restore the Mings. John Liu is on top of his game, especially with his boot work. Eagle Han Ying is a very formidable opponent as the Manchu warrior To Ku Lun. Also in this film is Charlie Chan as the captain of the guard Ka Yee Kee. There's a Japanese con woman who is much more than that as you can easily figure out. All & all, the action is top notch with all the major players displaying great skill. An absolute must see for those who love & appreciate the genre.

WARNING: there's some nudity just in case you're watching with the kids...",1491350400,,765,4.134228187919463
