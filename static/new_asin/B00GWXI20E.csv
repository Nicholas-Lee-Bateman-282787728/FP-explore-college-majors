6120986,5,B00GWXI20E,"I agree with all the other reviewers. This is great tv!  It is set in Melbourne ,Australia which makes it a bit different. I also greatly appreciate the supporting cast who are all charming and play their parts well as supporting players. I love how this show is styled -I have never seen Phyrnee in anything that isn't gorgeous!! The storylines are all fun and there is a sense a humor to each . Please Australian Broadcasting Company make many,many seasons!!!!!",1391990400,5,463,4.716049382716049

6120988,5,B00GWXI20E,Absolutely adore this show. It would be a crying shame if it doesn't get renewed for a third season. Cannot wait until this is released on DVD. Come on season 3!!!,1389484800,29,163,4.290322580645161
6120989,5,B00GWXI20E,"Swear to god, if the Australian Broadcasting System doesn't renew this show for a third season, I'm gonna take a hostage.",1388793600,127,121,4.809523809523809
6120990,5,B00GWXI20E,I saw this on New Years Eve and Day - and was so impressed that I searched until I found it on NetFlix - I watched the first series and now want more! I find that the second series is not yet available in the US. This is refreshing and really entertaining.,1388620800,43,256,3.9423076923076925
6120991,5,B00GWXI20E,I love these mysteries.  They are intriguing and have some really good humor inserted in the stories.  They are  great English mysteries.,1388620800,10,137,5.136363636363637
6120992,5,B00GWXI20E,A lady sleuth in the tradition of good British TV drama but with more style and pizazz.  Aussies did this one right.  Can't wait for the release of season 2.  Season 3 in doubt but you can sign a petition at change.org.,1388188800,74,219,4.166666666666667
6120993,5,B00GWXI20E,"A stellar Season 1; Season 2 is as Deco-delicious as the first.
Self-indulgent flapper Miss Fisher and her world are Hotsy-Totsy. Nifty! Kerry Greenwood, who's novels are adapted, calls this TV series ""Perfect"". Sets -locations- costumes -props, all the Bees Knees. Worth more than 5-stars, like Poirot, Downton Abbey, and Midsomer Murders. Ritzy 1920s Jazz included.
Flapper Period Bliss! I'm hoping for a ten-season run.

Phryne Fisher was a dame, brisk, but also innately kind, wealthy but hasn't lost the memory of her past poverty. She was heartwarming, sexy, funny, gutsy, intelligent, and late 29s modern-lady perfection. This arrogant, brash, flirt carried a .38, a diaphragm, and was a kleptomaniac with crime scene evidence items. Phryne (pronounced Fry-nee) was spiffily played by Essie Davis (Girl with a Pearl Earring). A PI, always a step ahead of the local cops, not unlike Poirot, Miss Marple, and Sherlock. Cops DI Jack (Nathan Page) and Constable Hugh (Hugo Johnstone-Burt -`Cloudstreet'); both deserved ""Hugo"" accolades. The last of the every episode cast was Dot (Ashleigh Cummings) a darling maid. All Aussies, like the production, but it was NOT Outback stereotyped.

SDH SUBTITLES FOR 13 new episodes as well as nearly an episode-length of bonus.
1 Murder Most Scandalous -PI Phrynbe's undercover fan dances while the Dep. Comm. is investigated for floozy murder.
2 Death Comes Knocking -A seance is 1st clue to 2 WWI murders but Phryne asks vets for 1916 battlefield accounts.
3 Dead Man's Chest - Burglary case turns to triple homicide and secrets beyond 'who-dun-it.'
4 Deadweight -Fight throwing and illegal bets is sure to lead to a murder. See it ringside.
5 Murder a la Mode -More to it than just murder via hairpin at a high fashion salon. Like ""House of Elliot"" a must own series.
6 Marked for Murder -Is football captain hanging death suicide or foul play?
7 Blood at the Wheel -When a female dies in a race car, Phryne gets behind the wheel.
8 The Blood of Juana the Mad -A professor joins his anatomy class as the cadaver
9 Framed for Murder -Silent movie leading man's death on-set in Phryne's own film investment. Can she direct too?
10 Death on the Vine -Local town objects to Phryne's look into a pair of vineyard deaths.
11 Dead Air -Another 3JH Radio Station incident--choked to death--but this time Jack's undercover.
12 Unnatural Habits -What's happening at the convent that gets a wayward girl bound & drowned?
13 Murder Under the Mistletoe -July Christmas in a chalet, but Father Christmas turns into the Grim Reaper; and a partridge in a pear tree.

6121145,3,B00GWXI20E,"Season One was 1080i, 25fps, as it was meant to be seen. If you are looking at Miss Fisher on Blu-ray, sadly, the first season was the only one released with the correct timing. Season Two and Season Three are both slowed down, way down, pitch lowered and timing completely ruined, in order to convert to 1080p. I highly recommend a purchase of Season One but if you want to see Two and Three, go for a 576i DVD from overseas and a region free player, or you can chance it and suffer through the slowed down version that puts me to sleep. Plus side, 24fps conversions like this work as well as Melatonin. Good luck making your selections.",1475884800,4,638,4.369747899159663

Eureka, I found them. The ""Roaring Twenty's"" theme with the old cars, architecture, clothing and some ""Tongue-in-Cheek"" humor is wonderful. The interaction between characters, especially between the main character and the police inspector, is priceless.

6121343,5,B00GWXI20E,"Thankfully, in this season, Miss Fisher's libertine ways are toned down just a bit.  It makes the series a more refreshing one to watch.  As they definitely have her pushing the envelope with each taboo affair that she has. The mysteries are a bit simpler than in series 1, but they are still very interesting.  And they touch upon social issues such as human trafficking.  The Inspector is ever more noble in his handsome and rugged way and the series does a clever job of figuring out ways to keep him and Miss Fisher's from getting together.  There is a sweet engagement in this series, but I do not want to spoil the plot by saying with whom.  The styles of dress on the part of Miss Fisher are as enchanting as ever, although, often of an Asiatic origin it seems.  But, the series is an entertaining one.  And the Inspector wins every viewer's heart.",1454889600,,855,4.470967741935484

The acting, the sumptuous and breath-taking costumes, the plots, the characters, etc. However, one does have to suspend disbelief because surely no one woman can do everything!  Be a great shot with her little gold pistol, be a pilot, a Houdini-like performer in a water tank, a race car driver, a singer, a fashion model--on top of being a beautiful and rich detective.

6121582,5,B00GWXI20E,"This is a fantastic continuation of the first season. Phryne Fisher is a intelligent woman, with a wit and charm about her that opens more than a few locked doors, and keeps more than a couple young gentlemen under her spell. Her continuation in this part of the series is after resolving her own deeply rooted mystery in the last season. Have no fear, however, there's no chance of this series getting boring anytime soon. During this season Jack and Phryne's relationship deepens, getting each other into new troubles and creating all new problems the closer they get to each other. There's also the sweet romance of Dorothy and Hugh that continues on gloriously. It's an incredibly well-written series, with a brilliant and strong female lead, a tough and daringly intelligent male love interest, and plenty of mystery, trouble-making, and downright crazy fun all mixed in.",1439164800,,876,5.006849315068493

If you have ever liked any Agatha Christie movies or TV adaptations, any Masterpiece Mystery series, and the like - this series is for you! I would not have picked Australia in the 1920s as a must-see setting for an amateur lady detective...how shortsighted of me! Try one episode and you'll be hooked. I bought the BluRay set for Seasons 1 and 2 - both for the high-quality video on my Plasma and for the fun Extras. (That is my main peeve with streaming/downloadable video - we no longer get all the background and commentary. Of course, that's no great loss for some types of show!

The dialog is smart and crisp, with plenty of both drama and humor.  Some of it will go over the children's heads, but they aren't the intended audience.  We find that this series is something we pull of the shelf to watch again from time to time just because it is so well done.",1428364800,,413,4.324675324675325
6121877,1,B00GWXI20E,"This series has excellent acting, outstanding production values and very interesting plots. My wife and I enjoyed both sets and are looking forward to season 3, which is now in production. So why am I giving it only one star? The reason is partially to draw attention to something about this series which, because it's not mentioned in the description, may result in some people being offended by certain scenes and inferences in the series, particularly the second set.

There is a lot of sexual hypocrisy in this series. Phryne Fisher repeatedly has casual, one-night sexual encounters with men who many times aren't even given the dignity of a name. They are simply the sexual toy of the moment. If a man had been playing the lead, these actions would have him branded as an immature, shallow womanizer. But because the series is about a woman she's portrayed as a mature, modern heroine.

In the second series, there are several scenes of partial male nudity that may offend some viewers. It didn't me but it did my wife. What we also noticed is that there were no corresponding scenes of equivalent female nudity. Again, this reflects an almost anti-male sentiment. If the gender roles had been reversed, there would be people protesting it as being sexist against women.

Finally, there is one scene in the second set where Miss Fisher is in bed and shown fondling a man's naked rear end. Had it been a man fondling a woman in the same way, the scene would have forced an ""X"" rating on the series as having pornographic content. But, because it's a woman doing the fondling, it's considered ""artistic.""

By all means, watch this series. It is superior in so many ways that it is well worth the purchase price. But, if your sexual mores are offended by partial male nudity, men being used as faceless sex objects and at least one scene bordering on pornography, be warned that some scenes in this series may make you feel uncomfortable.

The biggest shame is that the series is so good on so many levels that these sorts of visual gimmicks aren't necessary to hold viewer's attention. We've all seen grade ""B"" movies where profanity or nudity is added to bolster an otherwise unwatchable product. This series isn't such a case. The acting, characters and plots are more than good enough all by themselves. In such an excellent show, such scenes become distractions, not enhancements.",1428105600,4,2388,4.772397094430993

6121916,5,B00GWXI20E,"Stick with this series beyond the initial episodes, which are heavy on having an Agenda--that feminism means casual sex of infinite variety, disdain for the buffonery that is religion,  legal advocacy of access to abortion, wink-wink at the joys of drug use, coquettish manipulation of dumb males--all of which are heavy hitting elements of the Kerry Greenwood novels. BUT in the television adaptations of the books, watch what happens when Detective Inspector Jack Robinson enters the scene, with his drop dead debonair looks, his sense of integrity, and his still-waters-run-deep persona.  Out goes the Agenda, and in comes---the tantalizing possibility of ROMANCE!  Perhaps the writers of the series responded to feedback from viewers, who are far more interested in the will they or won't they relationship of Phryne and Jack than they are in politics.  This series increases in humanity as it moves along. Phryne, after all, is kind to the non-traditional family she has surrounded herself with, tolerating their differences and encouraging their growth.  The characters become less stereotypical as the series progresses, and oh, that wardrobe of Phryne's!! Wonderful.",1426896000,,1174,5.464088397790055

6121919,5,B00GWXI20E,"The 2014 Christmas Special is one of the best television mysteries I've viewed the past year!

It's July 1919 and Phryne takes Aunt Prudence, Dot and Mac on a Christmas in July trip to Alexandra Mountain. Actually, Phryne has turned the trip into a vacation. Its real purpose is to take Aunt Prudence to the mountains for business. Her late husband, Edward Stanley, was senior partner in the Stanley Mine. The mine has been closed for a decade, since the Christmas Eve cave-in that took the lives a many miners. Aunt Prudence was there at the time, and it sends shivers up her spine as she remembers ghostly voices singing after the cave-in. She and the junior partner, Nicholas Mortimer, are meeting to sign the papers to sell the mine.

What our heroes don't know until they arrive is that someone is killing the people in the drafty mansion situated next to the mine. The first death looks like an accident,  and after Dot calls Constable Collins to say they've arrived at the mountain. Collins tells Inspector Jack, ""Miss Fisher's gone on holiday again, Sir.""
Jack: ""Anyone dead yet?""
Collins: ""Only one so far, Sir.""

Jack and Hugh make it up the mountain right away. It soon becomes clear that people are being picked off one by one. If only they could leave! But a blizzard has closed the roads and shut down the phone lines.

You'll probably recognize this plot from Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"" (aka ""Ten Little Indians""). Instead of being bored with repetition, however, I found this mystery immensely fun to watch with great plotting.

I enjoyed the other episodes of Series 2, also, but the Christmas Special is excellent. For those of you, like me, who hadn't heard of Christmas in July, this is a Southern hemisphere excuse for vacations and festivals in the snow. Their winter, of course, takes place while we are having summer in the U.S. Sometimes it's called Midwinter Christmas.

For Series 2 you get 4 DVD discs or 3 BluRay discs. The 14 episodes total 727 minutes of light-hearted and atmospheric mysteries with lots of comic touches. English subtitles are available. The episodes are presented in 16:9 widescreen and stereo.

The last disc has 44 minutes of Bonus Features. No one feature is more than 5 minutes, but altogether they are a fun addition to your Phyrne Fisher enjoyment.
(Individual feature times are rounded.) Commentators include Fiona Eagger (executive producer), Kerry Greenwood (author of the Phyrne Fisher mysteries), Deb Cox (executive producer), Robert Perkins (production designer), Essie Davis (plays Phyrne), Hugo Johnston-Burt (plays Hugh Collins), Nathan Page (plays Detective Inspector Jack Robinson), Rachael Maza (guest plays Cora Derrimut), Mark Cole Smith (guest plays Tom Derrimut), Sibylla Budd (guest plays Renee Fleuri), Heather Mitchell (guest plays Simone Fleuri), Mariam Boyce (costume designer), Anna Karpinski (hair and makeup designer), Genevieve Picot (guest plays Velma Brightwell), Justin Johnston (Polly Woodside Education Facilitator), Warwick Sadler (stunt performer) and Daniel Fredrickson (guest plays Fletcher).
1.  ""Welcome to Season Two"" (3 minutes) Perkins says that Series 2 ""is definitely more cinematic than the first series. We've gone wider.""
2.  ""Phyrne Promo"" for series 2 (1 minute)
3.  ""Dot Promo"" (1 minute)
4.  ""Jack Promo"" (1 minute)
5.  ""Queenscliff"" (5 minutes) In the episode ""Dead Man's Chest"" (based on the book by the same name), Phryne heads to Queenscliff by the sea, and, of course, finds murder. Johnston-Burt has this to say about the man's 1920's bathing suit, ""I don't know how they swam in them constantly because, I don't want to get too graphic, but I think talcum powder would have been widely used.""
6.  ""Boxing"" (2 minutes) Boxers were celebrities in this era, and people like Phryne would have dressed up to see a match.
7.  ""Murder a la Mode"" (2 minutes) Deb Cox says, ""It's really about who women dress for.... For Phryne, it represents going from a lief of a poverty to a life where you can have the sensual pleasure of beautiful clothes.""
8.  ""House of Phyrne"" (4 minutes) Boyce shows us how she puts together Phryne's outfits for Series 2, including all those wonderful hats, of course. The problem with modern poly blends is that they don't have the drape or the luster.
9.  ""Football Message From Jack"" (1 minute)
10. ""How to Become Doctor Mac"" (1 minute) It involves sitting in a chair for over an hour while they arrange your bright red marcelled wig.
11. ""The Cars"" (3 minutes) The ""Blood at the Wheel"" episode involves auto racing. A few vintage car owners who have rented their vehicles for this episode tell us about their antiques.
12. ""Winery"" (2 minutes) The ""Death on the Vine"" episode was filmed at the Tahbilk Estate, a winery established in 1860. It's original cellars are still in use.
13. ""Essie Davis"" (3 minutes) As Eagger says, ""Essie just OWNS the screen."" I couldn't agree more. What a presence.
14. ""Polly Woodside"" (3 minutes) The episode ""Unnatural Habits"" has scenes on a boat. These were filmed on the Polly Woodside, an 1895 ship that has been a museum, permanently docked in Melbourne, since 1978.
15. ""Stunts"" (2 minutes)
16. ""Guest Cast"" (4 minutes) Deb Cox, ""Now... actors know what the series is, and I think it has this kind of popularity - they want to come play [in the series] the way UK actors want to come play a 'Poirot'.""
17. ""Christmas"" (2 minutes) The Christmas special ""Murder Under the Mistletoe"" was not shot on location. So snow was manufactured, from copped tissue paper, foam, styrene pellets and soap flakes.
18. ""Aunt Prudence's Christmas Message"" (1 minute)
19. ""Season's Greetings From Phyrne"" (1 minute)
20. Photo Gallery (2 minutes)

Between the first two series we've had 26 episodes of ""Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries"". A series 3 has been commissioned, and I look forward to it.

If you missed Series 1, you are missing a treat (though I think Series 2 is even better):

6122094,5,B00GWXI20E,"The family stumbled over this on Netflix.  And we binged through, and then did it again.

Miss Prynne Fisher is a 30 something Australian beauty who grew up as a strugglingly lower middle class home, went off to serve as a nurse in WW One, had many adventures, then inherited a British title and fortune.  So armed, she returned to her Native Australia in 1928 to tend to the unfinished childhood business of finding out what happened to her sister, who was kidnapped at the age of 10.  And in the process, becomes a detective.

The series is very well done.  Essie Davis is an incredible beauty who captures the sense of the period well, and is captivating in the portrayal of a ""modern"" girl of the period.  As helpers she has Bert and Cecil, two cab drivers who add color, a personal assistant named Dot who has charm and innocence, the local chief inspector as a love interest and combative comrade, and her very uppercrust aunt to provide almost pure comic relief.

The episodes are engaging, with variety and imagination.  And it is a different take on the police procedural.

We are really looking forward to Season 3.

Update 2015.  Season 3 was a disappointment.  The writing and dialogue suffered drastically, cast chemistry (strong in Seasons 1 and 2) was weak, and Jack seemed to be phoning it in.  The sound was tinny and the theme song lacked the luster it had.  Only Phryne seemed to be trying to make it work.

(I know, I realize that mentioning reality TV and Miss Fisher in the same sentence is likely a capital crime - but give me a moment)

Both seasons of this series are a joy to watch. It's more tongue-in-cheek than hard-boiled detective fare, but that's what makes it so much fun.  Essie Davis is perfect in the lead role, and the supporting cast almost feels like family.",1421971200,,535,4.670212765957447

It's lots of fun and not too gory at all.

I like how the friendship between Phryne and Jack, and Hugh and Dot are developing. Phrynes mischievous, but lovable antics are endearing. And, the writing is great. The period is reproduced beautifully, and the costumes are simply elegant to look at. (I desire Phryne's wardrobe with every episode that I watch!)

I would definitely recommend this series to any fans of period drama or crime drama, especially if you like a dash of playfulness added to your viewing!

You don't have to know a thing about Australia to follow the plots, but if you're curious about the country between the World Wars, each episode subtly explores a social issue that confronted the country in those interwar years.

6122328,4,B00GWXI20E,"The Acorn DVD sets for this show have one ridiculous flaw, one for which Acorn should receive no end of hate mail:  There is no episode list for either DVD set.  Each disc is labeled with the episodes contained on that disc, but no other information is provided.  Why do they do this?  Early ""Northern Exposure"" disc sets had the same shortcoming.  There is no excuse for such an oversight.

""Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries"" takes up where season 1 left off, more or less.  The story arc has already been established with nothing much being added in season two:  If you've watched Season 1 then you know how Dot and the girls came to live with Miss Fisher;  how Bert and Cec, and Mr. Butler came into her orbit and the trajectory of the romances between Miss Fisher and Jack;  Dot and Collins.  No new cast members are added, and early in season two the romance betwixt Phryne and Jack seems to have been squelched---this is fixed by the end of the series.  All in all the tone is what seems to have changed most.  Some of the later shows in season 2 seem a bit more dark than any in season 1.

The quality over all has improved, or evolved for the better, perhaps.

Each show is based on a book in what turns out to be a rather extravagant series of small books (thin, no more than a half inch each) from a very prolific writer, Kerry Greenwood.  Some books haven't made the transition and some parts of books that have, have found themselves on the cutting room floor.  Ms. Greenwood doesn't flinch when she seeks sources for her criminal minds, and if it involves unseemly activities with children, those crooks are just as much fodder for a book as an anarchist or murderer.  ABC (Australian, not American) doesn't quite share her egalitarian view of the criminal mind and often chooses not to carry certain plot lines, or to omit entire books.  Ah well.

The show of course is also different from the books in other ways;  Phryne is older than in the book.  She has no Aunt.  The lady doctor isn't nearly as developed as a character and doesn't show up after the first book or so.  There's a Mrs. Butler.

But hey, the show is so good that I really have no complaints.  I'm reading the books and enjoying them just as much.

What I don't like is the difficulty in finding this show to stream.  The Competition is streaming the first season, and Acorn (who produced these DVDs) is streaming 9 of 13 episodes of Season 2 (or at least they were), including the Christmas special.  So, I knuckled down and bought both seasons on DVD.

6122403,5,B00GWXI20E,"Season 2 of MISS FISHERS MURDER MYSTERIES, set in 1928 Melbourne, Australia continues the series. Essie Davis portrays the lead character the Honorable Phryne Fisher (pronounced Fry-nee). She is an intelligent, charming, feisty, and thoroughly modern woman operating in the post-war, still predominantly male dominated world. After inheriting a title and wealth due to the unfortunate deaths of all the heirs preceding her, in the Great War, Phryne has resettled in Melbourne, from an extended stay in Paris and London, to set up as a lady detective.

Phryne continues to sticks her pretty nose into places most people wish she wouldnt. Her intuition, deductions, and wit combined with a hand gun and a dagger make her a force to be reckoned with on both sides of the law. The tension between her and Detective Inspector Jack Robinson (Nathan Page) takes an unexpected turn.

Meanwhile, all of the lovable characters from the first season return  Constable Hugh Collins (Hugo Johnstone-Burt), Dot Williams (Ashleigh Cummings), Bert (Travis McMahon) and Cec (Anthony Sharpe), Mr. Butler (Richard Bligh), Aunt Prudence (Miriam Margolyes) and Dr. Mac (Tammy Macintosh)  each features in an episode which will delight fans.",1410393600,,1219,5.333333333333333

Miss Fisher is a glamorous, lady detective who happens to bump into a murder regularly.  She assists the dashing Detective Inspector Jack Robinson in solving cases.

6122630,5,B00GWXI20E,"For maximum enjoyment of either format, I wouldnt read any reviews until I had either watched the show or read a few of the books.

I guess this a review of Book #20 in the Phryne Fisher series, but I came to the books after binge watching Seasons 1 & 2 of the Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC)s  Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries (MFMM).  My burning question after watching the tv show was what was going on in the books between Jack & Phryne, did the books offer a clue of where the show would go.

Netflix put MFMM in my you-might-be-interested-in queue sometime during the Spring of 2014.  I finally started watching the show one Friday night in mid-July 2014 after a long week at work and ended up streaming all of Season One Friday night and Saturday and then then buying Season Two from Best Buy on Saturday afternoon to keep the binge going through Sunday.  I watched all 26 available episodes with great pleasure.  The beginning of season 2 was a little slow going compared to the others but season 2 picked up just fine.

The big tease in the tv show is the developing friendship, possible relationship between Phryne (rhymes with Briny) Fisher and Detective Inspector Jack Robinson.

As discussed by other reviewers, Phryne Fisher is unencumbered by shame about being a woman.  (Id like to know how she pulled that off, because shame associated with femaleness is built into western culture.  Id love to be as comfortable with my self, my gender, my sexuality, my right to sit at the Big Table as Phryne Fisher.  This probably says more about author Kerry Greenwood than Phryne Fisher, but I digress.)

Phyrne has her own code.  She isn't amoral but her comfort with her self is very male.

Detective Inspector Jack Robinson is also a man of honor.

So Phryne & Jack are very strong, very interesting characters in their own right.

Their counterpoints and stand ins for the rest of us ordinary mortals are Phrynes maid/companion, Dot  a good girl  and Constable Hugh Collings, a nice boy next type.  Dot & Hugh respond/react to the world the way I do.
At the close of Season 2-Episdoe 13, Jack and Phryne are still circling each other but not involved.
So Sunday night after episode 13 ended, I downloaded Book # 1 of the Phryne Series, Cocaine Blues, and started reading.
There are enough similarities between the Pilot Episode, also Cocaine Blues, that the book was fun to read to recognize things, but enough differences to see that the tv show was going to follow its own arc.  And I liked the arc that Season 1 created for itself.  Season 2 didn't really have an over-arching storyline.  The episodes were more stand alones.

I was consumed with curiosity about where Jack & Phryne's relationship--as depicted in the show--was going so I turned to the books for possible clues.  I read Book #1 and then jumped ahead to Book #20, the most recent entry at this time (July 2014.)

But heres the point of this review for others who may never read the books but only see the shows:  what I learned about Jack & Phyrne, that makes perfect sense, and should help me keep everything in perspective while Im re-watching Seasons 1 & 2 while waiting for the greenlit Season 3, is that Jack and Phyrne are good friends, respect each other, like each other and are colleagues.  If they flirt, they didn't do much/any of it in Book #20 but they clearly like each other.  Theyre respect each other.  They enjoy each others company.  No wonder they work well together solving mysteries.  Phryne being Phryne, Jack is clearly aware of her comfort with her physicality but the tension of not succumbing to each others attractions isn't an issue for the two of them.  This appears to be a really good choice for the books based on the two that I read.  Also, its pretty clear in the books that Phryne is the major characters and Jack is a supporting character.

For those of us who like us who like BBC's Sherlock, theres a sub-plot in Book #20 between two characters that is an homage to Sherlock Holmes and John Watson  and the homage appears to be to the characters as created for the current BBC version not the Conan Doyle canonical version.  Greenwood has a really nice explanatory note on her familiarity with all the version in book & film and now tv thats fun to read.  Dont miss the note which follows after the story closes.  Its like a book version of DVD bonus material.  For Sherlock fan's, Book #20 might be a nice place to start.",1405555200,,4443,4.581749049429658

Not only is Essie Davis incredible as Miss Fisher, just like I imagined she would be from the first book I read, but you get to know the characters and their back stories even if you didn't start out with Series 1 (however, I suggest that you get that series, too, if you haven't already). This is just a delightful group of mysteries, murders that are supposed to be solved by Detective Jack Robinson. However, you soon realize that, despite the fact that she's a pain in his proverbial you-know-what, he knows that without the insight she brings and her, shall we say, determination to get to the bottom of it all even if she has to put herself in danger to do so, it would be much more difficult to catch the bad guys. Dot, Phryne's aide and companion, is delightful, and I just love the character of the butler, aptly named Mr. Butler - he's always full of surprises. If you're a fan of murder mysteries, plot twists, the unexpected, and aren't a fan of blood and gore to get the point across, I highly recommend this series, series 1 and, if there are any others forthcoming, I intend to buy them, too.",1402272000,2,1325,4.390243902439025

The problem is that Amazon Instant Video and the other streaming website are slow to acquire the streaming rights. Take for example two British shows I've watched: One is missing the last season which was over five years ago and the other is missing seasons starting from about two years ago.

 Like the first series this is more of the same. Considering the small dedicated cast and the obviously limited budget in this made-for-TV series, they do a very good job. The picture and sound are excellent, there are good English subtitles and the discs are all-region despite it saying B on the insert. There is a lot of variety in the plots and the four main leads are excellent. This is very much aimed at middle Australia but any English speaking viewer with an interest in Australia will find them rewarding. The accents are quite light so you do not have to be Australian born to follow the dialogue. The price in Australia is much lower than the US and I regard both sets as good value.",1400976000,,802,4.418918918918919
6122836,5,B00GWXI20E,"The charm of this delightful series can be summed up by the following dialogue:

""There's been a murder, Mr. Butler.""
""Does that mean there'll be one less for dinner?""

or how about:

(referring to Phryne [that's FRY-nee] on the telephone)
""It's Miss Fisher.  She's on holiday again.""
""Any murders yet?""
""Just one, sir.""

I love it.

The first series of MISS FISHER'S MURDER MYSTERIES was an absolute delight. The Greta Garbo/Jean Harlow hybrid that IS the ineffable Essie Davis as Miss Phryne Fisher is back and in this reviewer's opinion, Series 2 is even better!

This outstanding Australian series is a breath of fresh air in the Detective/Mystery genre for a number of reasons: the acting, the scripting, the wit and taste in every aspect of production. If I had to single out one element that is perhaps the defining feature of this program, it would be the absolute perfection of the costuming, particularly the endless display of style and elegance that comprise Essie Davis' wardrobe. This might seem like an unusual emphasis when discussing a mystery series but it is apt in this case. Clothes define the character and the period (remember, this series is set gloriously in the 1920s). It also helps that the wonderful Ms Davis is a natural clothes horse, with the perfect figure for '20s fashion, matching her sexy, fine china-like beauty.

Of course there is plenty of action, too, with Phryne's reliable colleagues on the police force, namely Detective Inspector Jack Robinson and Constable Hugh Collins, both providing plenty of testosterone when needed (as do Phryne's two reliable ""gofers"", Bert and Cec--a great pair). As well, Series Two has a great variety of settings and backgrounds to the inevitable murders which helps to keep things interesting. One episode features a small town built around a winery and has background music that calls to mind an Ennio Morricone Spaghetti Western score (the music throughout the series is truly outstanding). Another features a race with beautiful vintage 1920's cars. Another a boxing match where Constable Collins demonstrates his pugilistic prowess. Another features a film set where Phryne's investment in an early Australian motion picture provides a real change of pace when she has to take over as the film's director! Another is set in a small radio station. Another in a house of high fashion. The list goes on.

And of course the relationships grow. Miss Fisher is a progressive, modern woman who, although elevated to the upper class through the acquisition of vast sums of money explained in Series One, maintains a ""family"" about her rather than a collection of servants. She is an advocate for equality. For example, her trusty sidekick Dot, (technically her maid) continues to charm and assist with even more blossoming confidence than before. But will Dot's inevitable engagement to Constable Collins threaten her commitment to Miss Fisher? Will Detective Inspector Robinson succumb to his growing attraction to Phryne? It's all absolutely delicious.

The series is expensive to produce, with Series One being budgeted at a million dollars per episode. Series Two looks to have had the same investment. The producers insist on the money being visible on screen, in other words no expense is spared to provide all the authentic trappings of the period: the cars, the steam trains, the ships, and of course the aforementioned clothes.

It is this attention to period detail that is one of the show's strongest features.

At the time of this writing, it is apparently up in the air whether there will be a Series Three of MISS FISHER'S MURDER MYSTERIES. The ratings are there, but there is a plethora of good mysteries coming out of Australia at the moment and period dramas, especially this one, as referenced, are very expensive to produce. It would be a crying shame if MISS FISHER was ""murdered"" because of cost-cutting cupidity.

So enjoy it while you can, folks. And hope that the wonderful team behind MISS FISHER gets to do it again. This show has legs (and I don't just mean Ms Davis!)",1400803200,71,4067,4.9985207100591715

It was the ""Miss Fisher"" character that that bothered me, although I like the rest of the cast. Of course most first episodes of any series are mostly setting up the characters, so I knew it was only fair to watch more.  And heck, I bought it.  I was darn sure gonna try to like it !  It only took a couple more episodes to change my mind.  When ""Miss Fisher"" started showing a kinder, softer side it won me over.

Now that Ive encouraged you to start with Series One, Ill turn my attention to this product  The Blue Ray of Series Two. There are a few reasons to get the BD versus the standard DVD and watching it on Amazon Instant or one of the streaming services. The BD has great images and youll probably hear the great 20s jazzy score better via BD. But, if you need to settle for the DVD, thats fine too. I know a lot of folks stream, but in this case you will miss nearly an hour of bonus material on the DISC version.  More about that in a minute.

As for the murders in the 13 episodes this season, they really take a back seat to the relationships of the main characters. Each episode starts by showing a murder. Then comes the opening credits and then its time for Phryne Fisher to get involved. And is every case the screen writers have had Phryne be connected to the victim or their family. This year there are murders in fancy dress salons, at a race course, at a vineyard and- my favorite  a radio station. (I don't consider the previous sentence a spoiler.

This Australian Broadcasting Company series takes a few more liberties than US broadcast TV so there are some pretty violent murder scenes (but they are quick) and, there is no nudity shown , there were a few scenes with Phryne and some men where he double-entendres put her on top, so to speak. (Youll understand when you watch the series).

The bonuses include 21 short (most are 3 minutes or less) featurettes on the production techniques (vintage cars, sets and costumes) and some clever promo spots for the series with the lead actors in character. A lot of fun.
If you loved, Season One, youll love season 2. If you haven't seen Season One, (as I said) go back and start there.

6122844,5,B00GWXI20E,"I will not go through each episode as that is what you are purchasing the series for. Each episode has an introductory write-up. Then of course it is formula (hopefully the kind of formula you will like). We get introduced to the characters and a standard mystery with a couple of read herrings tossed in. It cannot get too complicated because it the mystery has to be displayed investigated and wrapped up in one short episode. So do not feel cheated if you guest ahead of time as it comes from watching all the other murder mysteries first.

The actors are competent. However it is interesting to see our prime mystery gall can be so acrobatic at times. You may recognize her as Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd (2006 TV movie).

Now I have to read the books. I here as usual they are better than the TV presentation, however we will see.

For those with DVD interests there is a Blu-ray version but I watch the standard DVD that was just fine on the big screen. We got the obligatory advertisement for all the other Acorn series.

Might go 15-20.00 for each full series just to check it, but it a missed opportunity by the producers.",1392595200,8,260,4.416666666666667
6122871,5,B00GWXI20E,"I will be getting series 2 of Miss Fishers Mysteries. I just received my first series. How wonderful Miss Phrynee  is. Essie Davis is a superb actress, so very adorable as Phrynee. The acting from all characters is mesmerizing. The mysteries are uniquely written, the plots are the product of great writers and the costumes are classic perfection. Thank you for giving us something worth while to enjoy. I have always enjoyed Agatha Christi, Poirot, other mysteries, but none are as captivating as Essie Davis in Miss Fishers Mysteries. If there were 6 stars, Miss Fishers Mysteries would get all 6 from me.  Cookielady903@mail.com",1392508800,28,631,5.0576923076923075
