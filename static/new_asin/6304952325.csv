7880894,5,6304952325,"While it is true that ""Viva Little Man"" is not a documentary in the usual sense, it does provide a lot of historical documentation on central aspects of Reich's work and the legal case against him which are of scholarly interest to those who already know something about him, and who want to go into more details than the usual FDA-skeptic attacks, or the mystical distortions of some of Reich's ""supporters"".

"" Wilhelm Reich: Viva Little Man - DVD An intimate time-capsule of people and places recalling the controversial natural scientist, Wilhelm Reich, M.D., his trial, imprisonment and the court-ordered burning of his books in America.
Viva Little Man includes interviews with many of Dr. Wilhelm Reich's former associates, friends, family members and scholars who have personally investigated the facts surrounding his life and work, to include: Dr. Richard Blasband, Willy Brandt (former German Chancellor), Prof. Bernard Grad, Prof. Jerome Greenfield (author of Wilhelm Reich Versus the USA), Mary Higgins (Trustee of the Wilhelm Reich Museum), Grete Hoff, Jo Jenks, Heiko Lassek, Elsa Lindenberg, Thomas Mangravite, Renate Moise (Reich's granddaughter), Ilse Ollendorff (Reich's wife), Dr. Eva Reich (daughter and co-worker), Tom Ross, Prof. Bernd Senf, and Dr. Myron Sharaf (author of Fury on Earth: A Biography of Wilhelm Reich).
With visits to the Freud Museum in Vienna, to the Wilhelm Reich Museum and town of Rangeley, Maine, to Food and Drug Administration Headquarters near Washington, DC where the plot was hatched to ""get Reich"", to the courtroom in Portland, Maine where Reich was tried, to Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary where he was imprisoned and died, to the New York City incinerators where his books were burned, and briefly, a search for Dobrenicza, Bukovina, Ukraine, where Reich grew up. With side-trips to Princeton, New York, Montreal, Berlin and Vienna.
Plus a small collection of Reich-detractors in mainstream psychoanalysis and the FDA, including prosecuting attorney Peter Mills and FDA ""historian"" Wallace Jansen (who coldly defends US government bookburning). """,1273449600,,2162,5.4375
7880895,5,6304952325,"This is the new DVD release of a fascinating documentary made by a German filmmaker during the 1980's. It consists of interviews with people who either knew Wilhelm Reich and/or followed in his footsteps, both in Europe and in the United States. It is therefore mainly of interest to people who are already familiar with Reich's life and work. To all newcomers: the film is NOT an introduction to Reich's life and work (as an earlier DVD release made by another publisher with an added-on misleading subtitle might suggest). For that, I recommend to get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Orgone-Accumulator-Handbook-Construction-Plans-Experimental-Use-and-Protection-Against-Toxic-Energy/dp/0962185507/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Orgone Accumulator Handbook: Construction Plans Experimental Use and Protection Against Toxic Energy</a>, and of course Reich's own books, also available here on Amazon.",1272758400,,947,6.8347107438016526
7880896,3,6304952325,"The subtitle ""The tragic story..."" for this particular DVD release of the film is misleading. As other reviewers have pointed out, this documentary is mainly of interest to people who are already familiar with Reich's life and work. As such, it is very fascinating, and an important historical document, but it does not serve as an introduction/education for everyone who is new to the subject. Also, there is a newer edition of this film available here on Amazon, with better picture quality, a different cover design, and without that subtitle which was apparently not part of the original title anyway:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wilhelm-Reich-Viva-Little-Man/dp/B0026X19M2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wilhelm Reich: Viva Little Man</a>&nbsp;To all fellow Reich enthusiasts, I therefore recommend to get the new release.",1272758400,,870,6.319327731092437
7880897,4,6304952325,"This has great historical value. I thought it was of great interest, but it's not any kind of overview for someone not already familiar with the basics of Reich's life and research. Personally I find Reich a fascinating figure, though I still don't know enough to be sure how much of his research is valid, and this documentary doesn't help explain all that much about the research -- how could it really, I guess. Vut there are anecdotes from all sorts of supporters and detractors that knew Reich, so it adds to the mystery, if anything. Also it continues to be very perplexing the extent to which he was persecuted -- books burned in the US, thrown in jail, etc. -- and even given the anti-communist paranoia of the FBI, that just doesn't seem to explain the extent of what they did to him. For instance banning the distribution of his orgone accumulators (these are just boxes made of sheet metal, wood and steel wool), which is what they threw him in jail for. And the destruction of his cloudbusters. What were they so afraid of?",1248566400,,1035,4.56989247311828
7880898,2,6304952325,"""Viva Little Man"" is unfortunately one of the only documentaries available on Wilhelm Reich, the pioneering psychotherapist, and founder of the Western current of body psychotherapy. I too, like the prior reviewer was looking for a ""Biography"" channel style documentary and thought i had found it when i came across this one. I was dissapointed, this video only partly satisfies the requirements of a documentary (interviews with persons in the life of the subject & visits to significant locations), there is virtually no overview of Reich's life in the standard chronological sense, no attempt to present a comprehensive overview of the subject's life. It is all pieced together from recollections and interviews and the remaining physical evidence, documents, etc. The German filmmaker also doesn't attempt to force a/her view on us. She interviews friend and foe alike, family members, collegues, skeptics, intelligent members of the political, scientific, and psychotherapeutic community in Germany and America, even Reich's grocer! Anyone's who's either heard about or met, or had a relationship with the subject. The effect of this approach is that one is left with only impressions, that one accepts or rejects based on one's already pre-existing disposition. Rather than coming away with a feeling that one understands the subject better after the experience of watching this film, one is instead left feeling that one has only scratched the surface, that the suject has been somehow lost and mystified amongst all these impressions and reminisces.",1178841600,2,1557,5.43801652892562

7880900,3,6304952325,"As a researcher with a strong interest in bioenergies / subtle energy research (chi, prana, orgone) and interest in consciousness studies and human potential, Reich is naturally a person I wanted to check out in more depth as he is an amazing person for many reasons.  I wanted to know more about him, and more importantly his work and research.  I was excited when I found a documentrary and thought I would take a risk and get it even though I saw no reviews.

This dvd documentary however (if you can even call it a documentary) was not good.  Not only did it look like it was shot with a shoestring budget on a home video camcorder, but it doesn't flow at all, present a chronological timeline for Reich's life, and is filled with several interviews that are poorly shot, poorly edited and at times hard to understand.  There is no narration which combined with other elements, leaves one a bit lost throughout the film.  This is only worth watching for die hard fans or those conducting deeper research.

Although it may be something a die hard Reich fan or biographer might want in his or her library, I would recommend to the general public and interested researchers alike - stay clear of this one and save your money.  It seems we'll have to wait for a better one to come along...",1155340800,15,1289,4.525862068965517
