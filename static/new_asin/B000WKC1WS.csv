2982801,3,B000WKC1WS,"We owe all the volumes of the first series and my daughters and I LOVE them. I was so excited to see there were three new DVD's available. However, I was a little disappointed. A lot of the signs have already been covered in previous volumes and there are not as many songs. They use the same song throughout the DVD. I also don't like the alphabet/math segments. If I want my kids to learn math and their ABC's, I will get them DVD's that teach that. I want my kids to learn more signs...

I am still a big fan of Signing Time; it has done wonders for my kids, but the second series could have been better...",1194134400,14,609,4.117647058823529
2982802,5,B000WKC1WS,"Signing Time continues to WOW!  Volume 2 editions: Move and Groove, Nice to Meet You, and Happy Birthday To You provide excellent progression for new vocabulary words, fantastic songs, and simple conversations. I love the learning concept of `ABC Time' that teaches pre-reading skills and `Counting Time' that teaches early math skills. As always, Signing Time emphasizes American Sign Language (ASL) in an entertaining and educational series.  Keep them coming, we love Signing Time!",1193616000,,484,5.527027027027027

8223578,5,B000WKC1WS,"We LOVE signing times! They are fun to watch for both me and my kids. We learn the signs so fast and easy. My kids ask to watch them over and over. With the help of the signing times dvd's my oldest son knew over 50 signs by 18 months old! it made that age so much easier becuse he could tell me what he needed or wanted so much faster then me playing the guessing game. Now at age 6 he is in first grade and able to put the skills to use with a another kid in his class who is Deaf he really likes that he can still ""talk"" to this other boy.",1425254400,,542,3.6810344827586206
8223579,5,B000WKC1WS,It's funny and very well done. I'm using to teach signing language  to my grand daughter and she had learn a lot. Very fast.,1305072000,,124,4.166666666666667
8223580,5,B000WKC1WS,"This entire series works well with our 4 year old. We started with him before he was one and never experienced the ""terrible twos"" because he was not being frustrated by not being able to communicate",1301875200,,199,4.555555555555555
8223581,5,B000WKC1WS,I got Signing Time for my 4 year old who has sensory proccessing disorder. Watching the videos has opened up a whole new worl of opporitunity for him and the whole family. For the first time we are able to communicate with him free from tantrums and it has also been an incredible way to help increase my son's use of verbal language as well and in the future I plan to increase our Signing time library and also utilize flash cards.,1300752000,,433,4.2926829268292686
8223582,4,B000WKC1WS,"We own most of the Season 1 DVDs and my 22 month old daughter loves watching them (she has been watching the DVDs since she was 16 months old).

These DVDs (Season 2: Vols 1 to 3) are nice but repeat many of the signs from the first season DVDs. Also, the songs in the first season set of DVDs sound more catchy and original and my daughter keeps going back to them. She can pick out the DVD she wants to watch and though she does occassionally ask for these, the Season One set remains her favorite.

Of course, it could well be that she starts to find it more interesting as she gets a bit older.

There was a good deal available from one of the sellers ($37 for all 3 DVDs before shipping - as compared to Amazon's offer of $54 for the same thing), which also made the purchase interesting.",1297296000,,793,4.136363636363637
8223583,5,B000WKC1WS,"Great videos. Our two year old loves watching them.
He tells us which ones he wants by title and color.
While he does not have the finger dexterity to do all the signs, he knows most of them and what we love is that we have used the entire set to introduce him to new concepts like school etc.
This worked wonders before we enrolled him in preschool.
He loves the songs too and will hum or sing some of them.  Plus since we have the music CD, it's a great way to calm him down in the car when he gets upset over something.  The songs never fail to soothe him.
We never leave home on trips without the music or DVDs.  On a couple of long haul flights the DVDs saved our sanity with him watching them on a portable player using volume adjusted head phones for children.
Buy them, you won't regret it.",1284595200,,798,4.102564102564102
8223584,5,B000WKC1WS,"Though I initially bought this for my 18 month old, (recommended by a sister-in-law to skip the baby sign one because when she bought them, here baby liked the normal ones better than the baby ones), but it turns out that my older boys love it as well.  It is a great product and a great way to help little ones communicate.  Musical instructional songs keep the attention well.",1267401600,,378,4.463768115942029
8223585,5,B000WKC1WS,these are the best videos for kids. educational and entertaining. my daughter picks up signs from this series every time she watches.,1265846400,,133,5.090909090909091
8223586,4,B000WKC1WS,"These three DVD's really positively enforce learning the alphabet and counting but you don't really learn many new signs (you do learn a few new one's on Nice to Meet You but pretty much nothing new on the Groove one) So, if you have not seen Season 1 then these will be great but even if you haven't they are still nice.",1222128000,,321,4.193548387096774
8223587,3,B000WKC1WS,"We are a huge Signing Time fan and my 3 year old daughter watches Series 1 over and over.  I was very excited to see that there was a Series 2.  However, we have been disappointed in the second series overall.  The DVD's don't seem to hold my daughters attention the way that Series 1 does.  There are MANY duplicate signs from the first series - which was very disappointing since we want her to learn ASL as a second language not just for baby signs. And there aren't nearly as many songs.",1215216000,4,491,4.247311827956989
