8229105,5,B000XPZSB8,"Jan. 28, 2018: I've seen other films and documentaries about the sex trafficking of children after a friend went to Cambodia to help in rescuing these children but nothing touched me as profoundly as this movie did.  It's a short film but while watching it you see at first a confused little child and then, little by little, you watch as she realizes what is going to happen to her - rape and sodomy and torture - and her innocent childhood is being lost forever, never to be regained even as she and another child try to hold on to some semblance of youth...it will break your heart and hopefully spur you to action...some kind of action for this scourge of child sex trafficking is spreading throughout the planet even in the United States.  If you cannot act then pray for these children who have lost everything and live in darkness and pain and fear until they are no longer of use to their brutal captors and then...some are just killed off or thrown away.  Think of your own child and act...and pray! Above all - pray!",1517011200,,1026,4.475935828877005
8229106,5,B000XPZSB8,This wasn't really a film I was expecting a twist in. I took it as it came and solely expected it to be a depressing glimpse into something we all know about. The ending took that depression to a whole new low.,1451692800,,210,4.023809523809524
8229107,5,B000XPZSB8,"I have seen many films related to the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Being involved in the rescue of children around the world for many years, I can without hesitation, this film has captured the essence of what is happening to the most abused children on earth since the dawn of creation. While absolutely heartbreaking, this film will open your eyes to the truth. The young girl who portrays Mudan is riveting. She doesn't speak more than 10 words in the film, but has captured the emotions of what happens to these girls with her expressions. To the students at Florida State University - excellent job.",1383523200,2,619,4.849056603773585
8229108,5,B000XPZSB8,"The subject matter makes this a difficult film to watch. While it is fiction, it presents a story that is all too true in today's world. It is short but very effectively portrays the taking of innocence for profit.",1284422400,3,214,4.512820512820513
8229109,5,B000XPZSB8,"This film short from an FSU film student is a quiet film on the child sex slave industry. The performances are very good, especially 8-yr-old Nicole Nishimoto who must convey her feelings and awareness through her facial expressions as she has very little dialogue. On first viewing I  took in the whole story (subtitled) and found a compelling story with a real punch. But my second viewing afforded me the opportnity to pay attention to the camera angles, lighting and editing and I was impressed by the work of those both in front of and behind the cameras. This film would be appropriate for classes studying/discussing child slavery/sex slavery as it never shows any sexual acts yet conveys quite well the physical and emotional and spiritual degredation caused by human trafficking.",1279152000,4,788,5.015267175572519
8229110,5,B000XPZSB8,great work! that movie will make u stand and fight for justice! hard to watch but u have to know what is happening in our backyards!,1257033600,2,132,4.115384615384615
8229111,5,B000XPZSB8,"It is 23 min long, but oh so powerful!!
I long to do something about sex trafficking/sex slavery! This movie is an easy movie to show to people and give some awareness especially because it is not long.

It is not a true story as far as I know but it is based on the fact that this is really happening!!!",1246838400,2,304,3.9836065573770494
