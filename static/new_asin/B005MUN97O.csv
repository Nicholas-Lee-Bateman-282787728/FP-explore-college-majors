8479819,5,B005MUN97O,"What a marvelous, marvelous film -- a real ""then and now"" classic, with the same excellent woman (Ms Tilda!) touring Berlin & environs before & since The Wall's removal. Visually stunning, and chock full of intentional and unintentional observations and statements!",1418428800,,265,5.487804878048781
8479820,5,B005MUN97O,"First you should know:

You see two movies - not documentaries. Tilda Swinton acts as a person, who cicled in 1988 along the Berlin Wall and (maybe) tries to find her own traces 20 years later.

Both are about Berlin Wall - hidden places and poetic views, including poetry and silence.

Very helpful for people, who want to see different ways of getting closer to an unbelievable construction...",1388880000,,395,4.779411764705882
8479821,2,B005MUN97O,"I imagine deep meaning in this movie. I can't see it, really, but can kind of imagine it. The inherent drama of the Berlin Wall (my brother patrolled that border during the Cold War), the contrast of Wall vs. No-Wall - these things changed lives, and families, and generations of families. Then there's the personal element of Swinton navigating all that physically, by bicycle, with her majestic physique.

But, somehow, it never touched me. I have no personal experience of the city (before or after Wall), or the wall (before or after Wall). All I see is a woman on a bike. A fascinating woman, admitted, but many fascinate. She's extraordinary, but this strikes my sensibilities as less than ordinary.

8479822,5,B005MUN97O,"Two films by Cynthia Beatt set in Berlin where East meets West and two chances to discover the great secret of femininity from the Oscar winning star Tilda Swinton. This is Tilda at her best - poetry in motion.

In ""Cycling The Frame"" she is the incredible and very delectable essence of femininity itself juxtaposed against the Berlin wall, the arch symbol of masculine paranoia and totalitarianism. History records that in 1989, just a year after this film was made the wall came tumbling down and when the dust settled the final score turned out to be Tilda Swinton 1 - Erich Honecker 0.

In ""The Invisible Frame"" (2009) she's back this time as the divine Ariadne leading us through a labyrinth of chthonic imagery to discover the panacea for our troubled times. Watch out for the pied piper, the lost child of Hamelin, a rune carved into the earth and Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man - a riddle worthy of the sphinx.

Both these films by Cynthia Beatt are a sensitive and moving treatment of a painful episode in German history and the German psyche but neither film wallows, instead they soar and provide a great deal of inspiration. Everyone will have their favourite scene, there are so many to choose from, my favourite was the musical thistle. The DVD wraps things up nicely with a short parallel screening, still shots and a peak behind the scenes at the recording studio.

Oh ! and that secret of femininity.......its openness - I urge you to buy the DVD and see for yourself.",1281916800,,1489,4.67175572519084
