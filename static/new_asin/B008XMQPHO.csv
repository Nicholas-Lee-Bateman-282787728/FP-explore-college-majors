5189617,2,B008XMQPHO,"This movie seemed to have been conceived as an idea from one of the reality shows in which one is given a choice of partners to choose from. I think the idea as it applies to reality is unreal and as it applies to the unreal it has bad actors, bad writing and a bad plot. Besides that, it had subplots running at the same time. I could not finish it I wad getting a head ache. Two stars because it was gay theme.",1373328000,3,412,3.9166666666666665

5189620,3,B008XMQPHO,"((  THIS IS ACTUALLY A 2.5 STAR RATING  //  POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD  ))

Just as in any (heterosexual) fairytale, this film introduces us to an ""inheritance quandary"" confronting a young Prince of a Man (notice I didn't say Handsome) who is faced with choosing---from a selection of desirable women---that person who will become his wife.

OH, WAIT...WAIT...WAIT! ....Did I get this all wrong? Oh, dear me. Perhaps I misunderstood (though the storyline in this film, and the behaviors of its 4 male main characters, certainly make that easy to do). So, please..won't you let me start over again?

Possibly...just possibly...this story was, INSTEAD, about a Gay (or is he) young Prince of a Man, who is faced with choosing a spouse from a field of two handsome lads + one older man (and, whoa...an ex-wife). ....But, TRULY, it was difficult for me to conclude that any of these characters were Gay (altho there was one supporting character who....ahem..ahem). Most importantly, such was the case for me because I saw no Gay romantic behavior taking place between our Prince and any of his three choices. Though I suppose, relievedly for the 4 males actors involved, their script called for no lips to touch any other lips in this entire spouse selection process. In other words, none of these actor's acquaintances could ever wonder if they might, in real life, be Gay.

Lastly, much of the dialog, particularly for the supporting characters, is flip...silly...and nonsensical (at least for we non-Brits out here).  While there are many of the right platitudes spoken along the way, they usually come at the wrong points in the film.

So, if any of you out there are looking for a Gay romantic film to take home, this is NOT the one which would likely do it for you. Oh, yes...production values are pretty high (only because in its genre, it is not a cheaply-American-made production). And, admittedly, there are some funny bits.

This DVD will not be making it into my Library of Gay Keepers.",1344988800,13,1992,4.863905325443787

5189624,1,B008XMQPHO,"Whilst I love a good rom-com (straight or gay themed) this film clearly has the oddest of storyline and writing. Overall the actors did their best with the limited and predictable storyline but the main character Danny is not believable, nor are the other suitors in their respective roles. The characters are not well developed or explained during the film. If this was a love story - unrealistically there was barely any PDA between the characters! (Is this because the actors are straight in real life and there is a no kissing or tongue Clause??) overall it's like watching a predictable slow-mo car crash... You keep hoping it won't happen by some miracle but ultimately nothing can change the course. But most of all - after all the hard won battles to gain a degree of equality in some countries - this film totally destroyed the whole notion of the sanctity of a ""marriage"" or commitment - which is at best criminal in the writing. Perhaps maybe the writer believed with gay marriage legalized in UK - a gay theme movie can be made to equal the trashiest of Hollywood ""straight"" rom-com?",1431388800,3,1095,4.708333333333333

I am disappointed that it wasn't.  To my surprise, in the credits to discover that the person portaying the postman (Trevor Garlick), was the author, director and producer of this film.  In the opening scene, I saw a special twinkle in Trevor's eyes, when he looked into Chris Finch's eyes.
It is true that the script would have been better, with a better script editor.
That point being made, Some actors did very well, as others did the best they could with what little material was given them to work with.  I like the show, and will watch it again.",1412726400,,655,4.487394957983193

5189636,1,B008XMQPHO,"The story was odd, which is actually a positive, but when not presented in a way that rooted the story either in something more realistic or more heightened and fantastic, it all felt rather incoherent.  There are some unpleasant moments of mildly racist stereotyping that made watching some scenes uncomfortable.  While the lead actor and a few others do what they can with the script, some actors were truly horrible to watch.  But, the real killer of the film was the direction and the editing.  Something was off and no cohesive tone emerged.  Save your time and watch something else.",1400457600,2,588,4.84

5189643,5,B008XMQPHO,"This film is a classic representation of a British melodrama, with a bend toward the modern scenerio of gay proportions.

Looking at this film with those criteria will provide the audience with the necessary entertainment, for the love, the anxiety, and finally the modus oprendi--true love!

5189644,1,B008XMQPHO,"The premise offered a 21st century twist on the ol' ""wedding condition inheritance"" tale.  Sadly the entire thing is an unrelenting, crashing bore.  Clocking in at less than 90 minutes it still felt longer than War and Peace.  I'm not kidding.  The lead actor is short, not particularly attractive, so he must be a nice, yes?  Nope.  Instead we're presented with a selfish, egotistical to the point of narcissism, cruel and petty little man who keeps getting referred to in attractive terms and who literally dozens of men want to gay marry.

What little story there is, for the first quarter of the film, mostly tossed aside in favor of endless bad pop tunes accompanying Danny (our hero) in his selection process, followed by more bad pop and a parade of family members, friends, hangers-on and other irritating guests arriving at a fancy country inn for the wedding.  A bit more dialogue, then more music, pointless plot twists (one involving an drunk uncle trying to connive Danny out of his inheritance) and then at least two false starts to the main event itself.

Dreadful stuff.  A comedy with as much lift as a lead balloon.",1376265600,2,1133,4.764102564102564

The acting is fair and passable but the lack for any continuity ruins what ever good qualities the film might have had.,1375574400,,331,4.672413793103448
5189646,2,B008XMQPHO,"This movie was supposed to be a comedy but it was not funny. Two of the actors were horrible clichs and the rest were just bad actors. The movie was not unbearable so I did watch it all and in the end it (like the last ten minutes) it was getting better but then it was over. Had interesting possibilities with the story line that were not explored, weak plot development and no good actors what-so-ever. Even the lead male part was supposed to be a hottie, which his body was, but his face was not which seemed to be a theme in the movie. Weak all around.",1375488000,2,556,4.157407407407407

5189649,1,B008XMQPHO,"Wow. This film was so bad. I kept expecting it to get better and it only got worse. They hinted that his lifelong best friend was his true love (he refused to attend the guy's first wedding, he ""wept"" before this one etc etc.) That led nowhere. Several sympathetic characters were set-up -- all so they could get their hearts broken by a guy who wasn't so great to begin with. And he wore the ugliest bathrobe. Supposedly, they all had big dicks. There was just no point to any of it! The screenplay was atrocious. I'm annoyed that it was listed as 3 stars.

It seemed like they were making this up, dialog and all, as it was being filmed. Acting? There are no actors here. Eye candy? Thank goodness I knew better than to believe that in the first place.  Stupid, stupid, stupid, all the way through. I give it 1 star because it was 1 of the first gay brit films I could actually understand the words although, they were just plain stupid too. I hope my 1 star rating gets the current 3 star average rating put down to at least 2 and a half so people who don't watch anything below 3 stars are at least saved from this gawd-awful mess.",1373673600,9,742,4.152777777777778

Spoiler: Did they really have to pick the creepy guy in the end? For the first half of the movie, Raj was looming over him/getting way up in his personal space. The night before the wedding was also strange with Raj bringing him into his bed and repeatedly saying ""let's take it slow."" At this point the story would have been better off trying to redeem the rent boy into a heart-of-gold type.",1518998400,,450,4.232558139534884

Out of this idea there could be good achievements, but this wasn't the case. The film is so boring, maybe because of the script, maybe because of the main actor, maybe because of the direction, maybe because of all this and something more. The fact is youll have difficulty in getting linked to this movie. There are some scenes that are actually funny, but there isn't much more than it.
As a whole, this isn't the kind of entertainment I would recommend for someone looking for a good gay rom-com. It can only be a passing time for someone that already have seen all good things in stock, and isn't willing to re-watch some of them.",1479859200,,738,4.355072463768116
