8295595,2,B001DZOCN2,"This is an awesome program and lots of good information which includes surviving pilots and family members. This is the second copy that I've bought and the audio is still the same. The audio keeps ""cutting out"" numerous timeswhile people are talking. This is the only complaint I have about this program. I work a lot of hours during the week and can't get to the post office to return it......",1463788800,,395,4.577464788732394

8295597,5,B001DZOCN2,"This shows the story of the kamakize and it talks to survivors on both sides.  There is a lot of good footage here and great interviews. You will learn that many of the young men were forced basically to do this.  It's a failure in leadership that lead to this situation in Japan as they kept going when all was clearly lost. Fanaticism also is a factor in this .  But the story is worth seeing and learning about his terrible part of history.  I saw this on tv , so I can't comment on the quality of the dvd.  But the story is a  must see.  ""day of the kamakize'  is worth your time.",1402185600,2,584,4.017391304347826
