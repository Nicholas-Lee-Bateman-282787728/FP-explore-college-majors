3110378,5,B0013GS3WW,"This is a great series.  In some ways, John Barrowman's character is more fun and more mysterious than the unknowable ""Doctor Who.""

The second series answers many questions about Torchwood and Captain Jack, and poses many more.

These are great episodes - all thirteen. [...]",1216512000,7,276,5.088888888888889
3110379,4,B0013GS3WW,"Season 2 of Torchwood was a definite step-up from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-season/dp/B000VWE5OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first season</a>. The show is better written and organized. The first season was a bit too messy in terms of ending and putting together the episodes. The episodes and stories of this season 2 make more sense and a clear and consistent mythology has emerged. Many questions have been answered and even more have come about. The show also makes more tie-ins with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B000E41MS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>.

The first season was all over the place, stretching and sending each character into a million and one places. They were testing the waters and finding out who each character was and how far he or she would go. Now, the show has found its soul (corny I know...). Each episode of this season was darker and edgier as each explored an aspect of each of the characters and the interactions between them. Each character is more consitently written and the show itself shows more consistency.

We learn more about the creation of Torchwood and how Jack came to be where he is now. We also get Freema Agyeman reprising her role of Martha Jones for a 3-episode arch. She is such a good character!

The show is definitely better, definitely worth watching.",1215734400,40,1436,5.764150943396227
3110380,5,B0013GS3WW,"I reluctantly started watching Doctor Who a couple years ago and was instantly hooked. Then I met Captain Jack. I was in love! When I found out he was having his own series, I just HAD to watch. I was not disappointed! Season one was amazing as an introduction to the group. But season 2 was almost a coming of age season for every cast member. I laughed and cried and came back for more! I cant wait to get season 2!",1212364800,5,417,4.097560975609756
3110381,5,B0013GS3WW,"This season of Torchwood was epic.  All the episodes were awesome and I cant wait untill it comes out on DVD.  This season was comparable to the first season, you learn alot more about the cast in this season, and the finale leaves us on the edge wondering what they are going to do for the third season =)",1208908800,5,306,4.169491525423729
3110382,5,B0013GS3WW,Season Two has to be by far the best of the two seasons. It has action and everything else you would expect from Torchwood. Apart from some very sad moments (will not list the spoilers) this season was great.,1208736000,3,208,4.358974358974359
3110383,5,B0013GS3WW,"I had been such a fan of the X-Files that, when my girlfriend told me this BBC series was a sort of British Scully-and-Mulder, I was a bit miffed. I got her the first season, became completely hooked, and now eagerly await the show on Saturday nights.

While I can't possibly match the detail of the first reviewer, I'll just note that I thought the ""Adam"" episode was truly creepy and one of their best; the whole concept of substitute memories was extremely well handled. Really, though, I have enjoyed all of them.

If you like sci-fi or the paranormal, you owe it to yourself to at least check it out.",1206576000,11,605,4.441441441441442
3110384,5,B0013GS3WW,"Honestly, the only reason I started watching the show was because I thought John Barrowman was hot lol. Even though I heard negative reviews about it, I decided to watch it and judge for myself. I was pleasantly surprised with the show. Granted season 1 wasn't perfect but it had a lot of great moments. It had a lot of hits and misses but it was highly entertaining for the most part.

Now season 2 is absolutely fantastic! Much better than season 1. The show's dynamic has changed noticeably and the characters have become much more likable and fun. The story lines are more mature and interesting. Everything has been taken to a new level and the result has been great!
I can't wait to get my hands on the Season 2 DVD. The first season DVD was loaded with special features and I'm hoping this one would be the same. Every episode had commentaries, it's own behind the scenes look and miniature interviews with the cast and crew. It also included many deleted scenes and bloopers. But honestly, I would buy the DVD even if it didn't come with any extra material because the episodes this season have been really good.",1205971200,33,1120,4.544554455445544

3110386,5,B0013GS3WW,"If you like ""Doctor Who"" and are not offended by sex & violence, you will like this Who spinoff series.  Captain Jack is a real sweet guy, and I love John Barrowman as an actor.  Season Two fills in some of Jack's back story, and explores the consequences of what happened to him at the end of ""Doctor Who Series 1.""",1493337600,,316,4.163934426229508

3110407,4,B0013GS3WW,"Loved the first tow seasons - fun storylines, witty writing, and good chemistry in the cast!

Found the last two seasons DEEPLY disappointing - it feels like the writers totally lost track of the Dr Who universe *and* stopped writing well for the characters... didn't even bother to finish watching the last season, it felt like they tried to stretch a double-episode with a kind of lame premise into a whole season.",1484697600,,416,4.777777777777778

3110420,4,B0013GS3WW,Torchwood is definitely a more adult oriented series. It is full of action as the team deals with more alien incursions through the rift.  You also get to learn a bit more about Captain John Harkness past as a fellow time cop comes back with an agenda that is not clear.  All in all it is very enjoyable.,1482624000,,304,4.224137931034483

3110493,2,B0013GS3WW,Uneven at best - the whole idea of Owen Harper not being able to die was badly handled and just got silly.,1470700800,,106,3.8636363636363638

3110503,4,B0013GS3WW,I love the Brits and there shows! I started watching this series because of how good Dr Who was and I haven't been disappointed. I like the characters and the storyline keeps me interested. They intertwine the episodes so that you don't lose interest. The one little downer is they try to sneak in a little bit of sexual situations where they don't fit but other than that it's a pretty good season 2.,1469836800,,401,4.4324324324324325

3110517,2,B0013GS3WW,"I loved Cpt Jack Harkness on Dr Who. Here, not so much. I don't think the actor and director are on he same page with the character. Too many guns. Owen stays reincarnated too long and I didn't buy the premise of his animation. Tosh doesn't seem all that smart, not that she isn't but she doesn't seem to have smart issues. The whole time I'm watching I'm being distracted by who is attracted to whom and why. Gwen is in love with her boyfriend? No chemistry there and the chemistry between Gwen and Jack is over the top. I can't remember the plot for the season but I have visuals I can't get rid of everybody's partner. Owen: didn't like actor or character.",1468627200,,659,4.32258064516129

3110529,4,B0013GS3WW,"I really like the Torchwood Series Season 2. It is kind of silly but that is part of the charm. Just a cool fantasy show that makes for a great distraction from everyday life. In my opinion Torchwood is kind of a cross between Warehouse 13, the X-Files, and all those CSI shows. I have watched this entire series several times and I wish it would not have been as short lived as it was. I was able to watch Torchwood for FREE as part of my Amazon Prime membership. I had never even heard of it before it showed up on a suggestion list from Amazon. I am so glad I did find it.

So if you remotely liked Warehouse 13 or the X-Files you will more then likely enjoy this show.

Series 2 shares one of the most important elements of Series 1-- real relationships between people who are inherently easy to care about which is why we care about what happens to them.

3110682,5,B0013GS3WW,"Season 2 Includes 13 Episodes on 4 discs and a surprising Disc 5 called 'Torchwood Declassified'  As we have come to expect there were no jumps or skips in either the sound or the video.  Another quality production.

Episode List:
DISC 1;
1 ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang""
A conflicted Torchwood team is surprised to see Captain Jack suddenly return to their lives, and though he tries to come back as if nothing happened Jack soon finds that some things have changed since his disappearance. There's little time for explanations, though, as a mysterious stranger from Jack's past steps through the rift, and he's on a mission that only the Torchwood team can help him finish. But it becomes quickly clear that Captain John Hart is not all he claims to be, and as usual, Captain Jack Harkness has some secrets of his own.

2 ""Sleeper""
When a burglary turns into a slaughter, Torchwood suspect alien involvement. Who is Beth, and can she be as innocent as she seems? However, when the investigation escalates into a city-wide assault, Captain Jack realises that the whole planet is in danger.

3 ""To the Last Man""
Every year since 1918, the team wakes Tommy from cryogenic sleep, because one day they will need his help. But they don't know which year, or for what. All indications are sealed in a box that will only open at the right moment.

DISC2;
4 ""Meat""
Conflicts abound when a truck owned by Rhys's trucking company is investigated by Torchwood... and Rhys is there to see it. The meat it carries is tainted, or is it even meat at all? Rhys does a little investigating of his own, and might have something to contribute to the team this time around. But he's no longer sure who he can trust anymore. And can Gwen and the team trust him?

5 ""Adam""
Adam, an alien in the guise of a personable young man, is a 'memory manipulator' who implants false memories into the Torchwood team, leading them to believe he is an old friend. Gwen is induced to forget Rhys and Jack recalls painful memories of his brother before he exposes Adam. The team take tablets to restore their memories, in the process 'killing' Adam, who fades away.

6 ""Reset""
Jack persuades Martha Jones to go undercover at the Pharm, a sinister research facility, which is experimenting in the drug 'Reset', releasing alien parasites into the body to 'reset' it and cure disease. She is exposed by the Pharm's head, Dr. Copley and injected with Reset before the Torchwood team ride to her rescue.

7 ""Dead Man Walking""
Jack acquires the other Resurrection Glove to bring Owen momentarily back from the dead. However, Owen does not become fully dead again - even though his body is physically dead, some unknown force keeps him reanimated. And he's becoming less human...

DISC 3;
8 ""A Day in the Death""
Owen's been dead for three days and finds it unbearable. He meets a woman contemplating jumping off a roof and reveals that there is nothing after death. He then tells the woman how he ended up coming to the roof.

9 ""Something Borrowed""
Friday night: Gwen's late for her own hen party. This is because she's been chasing a man-eating shape-shifter, which bites her before Jack shoots it. Saturday morning: Wedding day. Gwen wakes up heavily pregnant.

10 ""From Out of the Rain""
An old movie theatre, The Electro, has been restored and is opening as a museum. Ianto used to go there as a child and invites Owen and Gwen to the opening. Jack hears faint music, like pipe organ, at Torchwood. Then the movie projector somehow plays a different film than the one on the reel. Ianto sees Jack in the movie, in a traveling show. Then the projector stops. Two characters from the movie disappear into the night...

DISC 4;
11 ""Adrift""
When a local teenager disappears Gwen is drawn into an investigation that reveals a darker side of Torchwood. Hundreds of people have disappeared without trace, but why is Jack obstructing attempts to find them? The answer seems to lie in the rift, and as Gwen follows the trail she makes a shocking discovery.

12 ""Fragments""
As the team is trapped in the rubble of a building, their paths to joining Torchwood are revealed.

13 ""Exit Wounds""
When the villainous Captain John Hart returns to abduct Captain Jack Harkness whilst unleashing a wave of destruction and terror upon an unsuspecting Cardiff, it's up to Gwen, Ianto, Owen and Tosh to save the day. Meanwhile, Captain Jack Harkness is forced to face some demons from his past.

3110692,5,B0013GS3WW,"I love Torchwood for so many different reasons. The main one being that the writers aren't afraid to push the envelope. My first exposure to Torchwood was with Children of Earth. I think I watched the entire series in one sitting. It was definitely one of these series where I found myself saying to myself ""no, they won't do that"", and then they do. While Children of Earth and the following series Miracle Day all follow one storyline, Season 1 and 2 are more individual stores each episode with character development built up during the series.

Season 2 focuses heavily on each character, their past as well as their future. Season 1 is left on with Jack missing and Season 2 starts with his return and the consequences as well as a returning time agent who becomes the antagonist of the season. While the first episode of Season 1 reveals how Gwen became part of Torchwood, Season 2 shows the stories of how Tosh, Ianto and Owen were recruited. Martha Jones makes a guest appearance in several episodes and there are heartbreaking changes in the Torchwood team.",1456444800,5,1066,4.7005347593582885

I like that their protagonist isn't always the same (like in Dr. Who) so it keeps the story fresh, and often times surprising - so good writers (kudos). Torchwood also addresses social issues very naturally - like you never know who Jack is going to find attractive - a male or female. Or who he might kiss - usually male (and not some pansy kiss - but a real passionate male/male french kiss), but makes it all very natural as part of the story as if a man and woman were kissing naturally as part of the story. There are other social themes like this, that are woven in as part of the story, so it all feels natural and very lifelike. I love the actors, their characters, the storyline. I'm not much of a TV watcher - I see it on Netflix or Amazon Prime - and watch when I'm back from international travel and need a few days to veg and rest.

3110746,2,B0013GS3WW,"Honestly... it's getting worse.  I am SO ANNOYED at programs who fail to provide continuity.  There are so many holes in the entire series that it has become a running joke to search them all out but now each and every show is riddled with mistakes.  The most recent one (just for me anyhow) was an episode where aliens were inhabiting ""human"" bodies and that the needles and syringes kept breaking on the person's skin yet... a bullet and car crash killed them.  COME ON!!!!  Please make up your minds on what's going on.  Plus as a watcher of Dr. Who I know background on Captain Jack and his story is totally off.  He spoke of being a child on Earth and now he had flashbacks of an alien plant in the future.  Yes, it may have been a false memory but it's still just lame.  And the constant nasty sex that everyone seems to have with absolutely no feelings of jealousy are ridiculous.  What are they?  Barn animals who just happen to co-mingle with everything in their path?  Real human beings cannot just bop each other with no subsequent feelings.  And their insistence on shoving their political views down the throats of their audience is pathetic.  They can't even keep that straight.  Either there is no Heaven or Hell or there is a Hell with something in the darkness lurking over you (like they have now said in multiple episodes).  Pick one and stick with it.

Of course watching Barrowman flirt and kiss is my favorite part of the series. In this season you finally find out about the other members and how they came to Torchwood.

3110787,4,B0013GS3WW,"Season 2 is Torchwood hitting its stride in terms of as much flow to the storyline as you get.with this show.  They changed the line from them needing t be ready for the big event hitting in the 21st century to being prepared.  Interesting given they never said what it was.  Now with Captain Jack hitting everyone on the show or at least wanting to we get introduced to some of his past and the person he stole his identity from who ironically has the hots for him.

With Season 2 we at least have science fiction and some better alignment of the story and the baseline for the story.  The show is a bit more consistent and the stories tie together better.  This is the season where the show earns it the 4 star rating as while there are still many deviations, it is science fiction and should have surprises in the technology or it would lose that portion of the show that drew science fiction fans to watch in the first place.

I personally dislike the inclusion of our captain's promiscuity with the men and woman as it distracts from the story and doesn't add to the character.  It is fine to include the personal life aspects of the characters in a series, but these are purposeless tangents in the story to add sex to the show at a level that feels forced.  They are already a group of isolated ""nerds"" who just so happen to be exceptionally good looking at the same time (just like real life?), could write consistently to include these details or not but instead it is sporadic and pointless to the stories.

The show continues to be an oddball show that given its writing flaws continues to provide the entertainment so lacking in most shows and thus keeps fans interested.  Just have to be ready to have things turn on a dime at any moment in any show which is part of the interest but also part of the lack of any real pace to the show and sense that there is a progression of a story line being told.  It continues to just be radical shifts in the story and revelations that don't reconcile to anything that has been building, just more information to add to the stockpile of wherever this show is heading.

I continue to enjoy watching in spite of the lack of sense of a story being told because there is enough energy and interesting developments that it is entertaining, even if not assembled into anything that resembles an ongoing story being told.  The change in the tone and cadence is just part of makes Torchwood unique.  I'll reserve whether that is good or bad until I get to the end.  For now it is just different and taking getting used to.  I have more negative to say than positive, but it does continue to be entertaining so I keep watching and liking it even when I find it frustrating and left with a sense that it could turn into something I don't like at any time within 2 shows.  So far it hasn't though, so I watch and am still enjoying what I see for the most part.",1404000000,,2901,4.340740740740741

Torchwood's job is to keep Alien (not just outerspace aliens) and alien tech in check. The reason this show doesn't get 5 stars is because it is sexually charged. My 13 year old watches with me and he giggles though most of it because we never know what is going to happen with the personal lives of the team. It isn't pornographic like many TV-MA shows just very sexually charged. Also,a warning, we call the main character, Jack, an equal opportunity Lover.

If you like Dr Who I think you'd like this series.
I watched out of order as the first one I learned of was the mini series Torchwood Children of Earth. When I found the series it helped put everything into perspective for me. Although if you watched Dr Who you know how Jack came to be immortal.",1396828800,,527,4.12621359223301

However, if you can handle feeling those emotions and more, this is a fantastic series. The acting is incredible, the plots are interesting and the relationships between the characters are complex and intense. The reason I started watching this series was because I had seen John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness on Dr Who, and was instantly drawn in because he is eye candy of the highest degree. The reason I kept watching, however, was that the show drew me in, made me feel as if I was actually there, in the midst of the action, created real, strong emotions in me.

Now that the stage has been set, Torchwood Cardiff shows off their goods.  The varied plots and good writing allow the actors the ability to interact as though they were not only friends and working together but truly friends in all senses of the word.

I'm not an expert on acting or plot building, but it just felt very washed out/dry and I only watched it because I wanted to check out all the instant videos I get.  Sometimes I felt like they were trying to go somewhere with the characters but then whatever the idea was just got dropped/reimagined.  It got a bit interesting end of 2nd season and seasons 3 + 4 were pretty good.
I'd say if you want to get the achievement for watching everything you can without additional costs (atop amazon prime cost), you can watch it in the background while you also have other stuff to do.  The first season was even worse so you can survive this if you survived that season.

3110908,4,B0013GS3WW,Loved all the Torchwoods. Not many spinoffs from other shows are worth watching but the Dr Who spinoff doesn't feel like a spinoff and made it its own.,1389916800,,151,4.428571428571429
3110909,5,B0013GS3WW,"I saw Miracle Day on Starz when it came out and watched it over and over and I've been wanting to see the original British TV series for a long time.  The best part about Amazon Prime is that I have been able to watch it for free.

This show has action, comedy, and truly makes you sit on the edge of your seat.  Sometimes it's a little corny, but that is balanced by some great writing, good acting, and suspenseful stories.  You will never be bored watching this show.",1389916800,,470,4.188888888888889

3110911,5,B0013GS3WW,"If you enjoy oddball science fiction and all things Torchwood, then this is a good series. O.K., some of the plots are a bit lame, and there are elements that cannot be explained. The logic is not always sound. But, there is always the good-looking and talented cast to keep you coming back for more. The pace of the shows is good, and the ideas are creative. I don't look for a whole lot of logic in a show built around the idea of a rift in time and space centered in Cardiff (or anywhere else, for that matter). Good entertainment.",1389830400,,534,4.297029702970297

3110916,4,B0013GS3WW,"This is a great take off from Doctor Who.  I've enjoyed watching most of the episodes, but I would like to see a bit less of the homosexualality that's shown in this series compared to others.  That slight issue however, is enough to cause me to take away one star.  Almost as good as Doctor Who, but every episode takes place here on Earth while Doctor Who gets to travel to different worlds and different times.",1389398400,2,413,4.407894736842105

3110930,4,B0013GS3WW,My wife and I Iove good sci-fi movies and TV series.  I was not sold after watching only the pilot.  It took another couple of episodes and we both got hooked. All five series did not take long to watch and we want more.,1389225600,,220,3.977272727272727
3110931,4,B0013GS3WW,I love the series just not all the language (cursing) and sex scenes.  Being a Dr Who spin off it should have stuck to the same family friendliness.,1389225600,,148,4.285714285714286

3110936,4,B0013GS3WW,"Even if the premise is a little far fetched this series kept my attention from the first episode to the last in series one. The acting is better than average and the actors are really great eye candy. For those who have a problem with Gay sex this is not for you although they are few and far between. Set in the future this is what COULD happen if disease was totally eradicated and population exploded,  Series two I switched off 30 minutes into the first episode, very violent an trashy.",1389139200,,490,4.384615384615385
3110937,5,B0013GS3WW,"What sets this series apart from many others is the writing. The plots are not developed nor concluded simply. The characters have faults that can realistically get in the way of solving problems. Also, the resolution of some of the plot lines are more realistic than The Hero Saves The Day.  Not all solutions are 100% happy endings.  However, anyone who is offended by the occasional character interaction that is adult orientated, would be better sticking to Battleship Galactica or Star Trek.",1389052800,,496,5.036585365853658

3110941,5,B0013GS3WW,but not quite as much as the first season. Still it's worth watching if you liked season 1 and enjoy shows like Fringe.,1388793600,,119,4.217391304347826

3110946,4,B0013GS3WW,Still good but lack a little from the killing off of two of the main characters in the series. But if you watch BBC you will find them on another Steven Moffat or Jeffrey Davies written show.,1388275200,,191,4.1891891891891895

3110953,5,B0013GS3WW,Love this show! Gwen and Captain Jack are the modern day Mulder and Scully. Gwen is a great but reluctant heroine. Jack is the lovable but unpredictable hero. The Torchwood Team with Owen and Tosh are very enjoyable. Seasons 1 thru 3 are the best.,1384732800,,247,4.511111111111111
3110954,5,B0013GS3WW,"I watched through all of Torchwood within a month so my perspective is a bit different from people who watched it as it aired. The season starts with the return of Captain Jack who has just survived the end of the world (again) unbeknownst to his team. We're introduced to a possible new adversary and throughout the season we learn more about the members of the Torchwood team. Maybe I simply didn't notice it in Season 1 but suddenly Ianto was funny this season, providing some of my favorite moments in the entire series. He unexpectedly becomes my favorite character. Still filled with special features, this is another wonderful box set. Season 2 is a bit better than season 1, less explicit language (not that it bothered me), plenty of twists and turns, and learning more about the characters was great. Despite knowing the fate of certain people, the end of the season was upsetting so beware of that. The end of season 2 works as a series finale much better than the end of Miracle Day which is the actual last installment. It's probably just as good of an ending as Children Of Earth provided, but maybe not as depressing.",1384473600,5,1132,4.63681592039801

3110964,5,B0013GS3WW,I had forgotten how wonderful the original series was before it went off the rails in its later incarnations. This is Torchwood at its best. Sad to remember how pithy the stories were and played brilliantly by a great ensemble. Wish Captain Jack and crew could use the rift to find their way back. Never will understand how they could ruin such a fun show by over producing and over stuffing.,1381708800,,392,4.535211267605634

3110971,4,B0013GS3WW,The next step in the story several characters history's and motivations evolve with some parts of their back story seemingly disappearing (though admittedly they could just be not talking about things that embarrass them).

I highly recommend starting at season #1 and don't miss an episode...you won't regret it!!",1379030400,,149,4.769230769230769
3110979,5,B0013GS3WW,Torchwood is a great series - series 2 did NOT disappoint! It was better in some ways because the characters have been fleshed out.  Still -the unexpected always occurs. My kids watch Doctor Who but this is NOT for children with some language and adult situations. This is great fun and feels like a roller coaster ride full of dips and surprise turns.. Gwen and Jack are the NEW dynamic duo - I highly recommend this series.,1379030400,,425,4.51948051948052
3110980,5,B0013GS3WW,"More adventures, more history, more intense, well worth watching. Everyone seems to revolve around Captain Jack. Still wondering whether he's there to help or just for a lark. If you search the Dr. Who series you learn more about him.",1378944000,,234,4.875
3110981,4,B0013GS3WW,I found this show and watched all the episodes I could. I really wish there were more. Now I have to be satisfied with reruns.,1378512000,,126,4.08

3110983,5,B0013GS3WW,Amazing! Great show. Even better than the first series! Takes the great characters from Torchwood and gives them even more depth!,1378425600,,129,5.190476190476191
3110984,4,B0013GS3WW,"Season 1 is hit and miss with some highs and unfortunately quite a bit of mehs and lows. It seems like the series is trying to find its footing and that the writers are still grappling with the voice of the characters.

Season 2, on the other hand, has mostly highs. The team dynamics is natural and a good grasp of the voice of the characters, resulting in more consistent characterization. The ""revamp"" of one particular character and his developing relationship with another sealed it for me.",1378252800,,495,4.689655172413793

3110988,4,B0013GS3WW,"Torchwood Series 2 was a definite improvement from Series 1 (not that Series 1 was bad).  Series 3 is even better.  It went off the rails in Series 4 (Miracle Day).  I'd love to see Torchwood come back, but in back in Cardiff not America.  It would be great if they could pretend like Miracle Day never happened.",1378166400,,312,4.327586206896552
3110989,3,B0013GS3WW,"Great price, quick shipping.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the condition in which the item was received. It was sent in a simple envelope, not padded in any way, and the cover was ripped and the case crushed. Luckily all the DVDs were still playable.

3110992,3,B0013GS3WW,"For a doctor who spin off it is very adult, and can be gory. It really pushes the gay agenda. Some episodes are amusing but it only so so in holding my interest.",1377561600,,161,3.909090909090909

3110994,3,B0013GS3WW,"Wow this was a MASSIVELY disappointing season of Torchwood. I thought they made a lot of mistakes like trying to squeeze in Jack's Brother Gray as a villain without probably setting up his story. You never really connect with him. After you watch episode 2 ""Sleepers"", of this season which was amazing, it will leave you wondering why weren't these aliens the main villain instead of washed up James Masters and his annoying little brother Gray. Torchwood is still better than most stuff on tv, but boy this can't even compare to Season 1, 3, and 4.

Highlights;
Sleeper(One of the Best Torchwood Episodes)
Meat
Adrift(Another Gem for Torchwood, excellent character insight to Gwen and Captain Jack)

Best Character;
Captain Jack(First Season I thought Gwen Cooper was better, but now the real Jack Harkness starts to come out and we see how different from his counter part Dr. Who he really his when it comes to his own sense of morality)",1377302400,,939,4.826086956521739
3110995,3,B0013GS3WW,"Overall, I would say I enjoyed this series. I mean I finished watching it. The zombie Owen, was intriguing, but was also just a long drawn out inevitable death, sad to say he was more interesting dead than alive. But mostly, I got sick of the many Cap'n Jack deaths, ugh! Honestly, being buried alive for 100 years....ick. The fact that the character is still sane is a bit of a stretch.",1377216000,,387,4.388888888888889
3110996,4,B0013GS3WW,"As with Series 1 ... Initial interest was in it's tie in to Dr. Who. Nicely done, entertaining and fun to watch. Can't say I loved it but it was entertaining.

Seems like they were quick to throw in the same sex kissing a lot. Not directly related to the story line so seemed a bit over done.",1377216000,,292,4.0344827586206895
3110997,1,B0013GS3WW,This series is not worth wasting your TV viewing time on. I would highly recommend that you move on to something good. This television series sucks.,1377129600,,148,4.730769230769231

3110999,5,B0013GS3WW,"This episode did not have aliens, monsters, or some nemesis for Cpatain Jack to fight; it was a time travel episode with an English infantryman put into suspended animation by Torchwood in 1918 and ""defrosted"" once a year since then.  The central theme of the story is that at some unknown time he is to have a critical role in sealing a time rift that if allowed to remain open will destroy...well, everything.  There is an emotional tug for Tosh but as always, things work out in the end. A great episode.",1377043200,,507,4.5
3111000,4,B0013GS3WW,"I bought season four of this show at a garage sale and once watched we were hooked.  Watched all other seasons on Amazon Instant Video and LOVED all seasons.  The only drawback is Jack-the main character is gay and they show lots of scenes of him with other men.  That was a little weird and disquieting, but that's my bigotry showing.  Original plots and great casting.  Jack, I hate to say, was not a very good actor, but nice to look at.  The supporting cast were all excellent actors.  It's kind of like a British version of 'The X-Files'.  Check it out.  I highly recommend it.",1377043200,,582,4.415094339622642
3111001,3,B0013GS3WW,"Torchwood is a decent series that is a spin-off of Doctor Who. It has very adult themes and sexual chemistry. However, it never quite hits the mark on drawing the viewer in. Character development is lacking, except for Jack Harkness. If you want to know more about Jack then watch this series. If you're looking for a Doctor Who type show, then look elsewhere.",1376956800,,360,4.640625

Jack's hello's were usually stopped with a ""Don't start!"" from the Doctor, and Jack is a sexy man!  He likes sex and makes no secret of it... and he pretty much exudes sex.

That being said... his time with and love for the Doctor changed him.  He genuinely wants to save the world instead of stealing from it, and Gwen helps keep him to keep being that man.  As does Ianto, who we see more of his relationship with in season two.

I really don't understand why more people don't like this series.  It's got to be one of my favorites.",1372723200,,694,4.212121212121212

Instead of 007 you get capt jack harckness who is hired by the British prime minister and queen to head up an organization called Torchwood! And they control unauthorized alien visitors who some just want to party and have a good time and others want to destroy the earth.
Either way Torchwood has to deal with them and Torchwood has the highest authority in the land! Also earth is centered on a riff, so we get all alien travelers. Did I mention Torchwood was established in the 1880s
Fun,quirky,gross, and if you get though all the shows just wait!
Anerican movie channel Cinemax did a season last year!
Lots of Torchwood fun but in America!!!",1370908800,,657,4.672413793103448

Human drama, science fiction themes, every day sort of stuff and yet it's all tied together by storylines that are extremely well written. BBC knows how to pick shows I guess. Watch them all, every episode and the Specials too. You won't regret it. Mature audiences,  should think.",1368835200,,402,4.569444444444445

When season 2 came out, I didn't think it was as good as season 1, but going back and watching it again, I have to say it was brilliant! I cannot understand how the BBC could not find the money to keep putting out Torchwood.  If you haven't seen Series 1 & 2 of Torchwood, I'd strongly recommend watching these shows.

3111052,5,B0013GS3WW,"As with many spin offs, it is in the second season that Torchwood proves its more than a spin off despite the many references to occurrences from Doctor Who episodes &  a story arc with Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) .  The past of the main characters are explored including how each became a member of Torchwood,  As with season one, the stories are very adult & deal with darker themes.  The main theme of this season deals with losses- family, love & life & how past actions shape & play a major part of who a person becomes.  It is too bad that this is the last full season of the series.  Why BBC only did a mini series for the third season makes no sense to me.

It has humor, drama, action, excellent special effects and clever banter - all I can ask for in my entertainment. The plot twists are for the most part surprising.

The emotions Torchwood evoked; the ability to incorporate human strengths, weaknesses; the ability of mankind to institutionalize the human conditions of greed, power, and manipulation of the populous into the fiber of government makes one realize that we all have a battle in front of us to fight for the right things in our society.  The Apostle Paul said it the best, "" I do not understand what I do.  For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do."" (Romans 7:15)",1357344000,,587,4.36697247706422

Sort of a new age Capt. Kirk. He spent a season traveling with the 9th. & 10th. Dr. Who. Got a feeling we will see him again with the 11th. Doctor. Well unlike most series Torchwood hit the ground running with a solid season one. Season two is even better. And Capt. Jack is now an icon on this side of the ocean.

Torchwoods attempt do make themselves a bit more adult than the Dr. Who stories, and wind up a little sophomoric in the attempt, most of the time. The second season develops the team more.  It is more about the Torchwood team, quirky as they are, than being just the Captain Jack Harkness Show.

The writing and acting totally carry this series way beyond what us American audiences are used to. (I do wish they would either stop killing off the principle characters, or let them stay dead when they do pass on!)

I doubt if the franchise will last as long as Dr. Who, but I think they have a few more great stories to tell.

She loves him too, she's even refused to shut him out of her crazy life and include him in the secrets of Torchwood, and now she's making the right choice in marrying him. Calm down, this isn't telling some dark secret about the female psyche, it's just entertaining you. It's just her character, it's just a show. It's okay, really.

All right, now that all the children are gone, I'll say that if you don't mind a well-written, well-acted, occassionally depressing science fiction series, then this second series of Torchwood is well worth watching.  Yes, it's intended for adults, so it's got a little gore, a little violence, and some swear words you don't normally hear on American TV.  Sex?  What sex?  You see Jack kissing a couple guys (in seperate episodes), and Tosh in bed with one man after sex and another man before (in seperate episodes).  No nudity.",1338336000,,582,4.818181818181818
3111094,2,B0013GS3WW,"This episode set about telling a guarded secret, which if told, would rupture the fabric of the family structure. The secret is that the woman you are married to is only married to you because you are safe and controllable. she has a 'true' love in her mind, but it is a man who is not controllable and who makes her give 100% to him. This is unacceptable to women and therefore they only marry someone whom they don't care about. Men don't want to know this. They don't want to know that, should she hear that you have had and accident, the first thought that goes through her mind is 'where is the insurance policy'. If she married you, you are the donkey used to carry the load. If she married you, you are only a fleeting thought in between the memories of her true love. If she married you, you don't matter; you are disposable. That gives her a feeling of control and allows her to save her emotions for the one who is truly important to her. It is dangerous for men to know this truth. both society and the species depends on men continuing to think that they are loved by their families even though that is the greatest female lie.",1337990400,,1139,4.3023255813953485
3111095,4,B0013GS3WW,"Torchwood Season 2 continues in the same vein as Season 1 - predictably unpredictable, a wild variety of story styles, with sex, death, aliens, and so on.  There are bold ideas and events that are somewhat subtle in their presentation; you have to think about what is being said to get the full impact.  It is quirky and quite different from most TV shows, and a nice change from the usual USA shows.  There are a few writers for the show, and they make no attempt to make the show seem like it has one writer, judging by the variety of styles - even from the same writer.

James Marsters makes an important appearance in the series, being part of the overarching story line for the entire season, which mainly affects the beginning and the end.  I really enjoyed him in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, as Spike.  And again as Spike in Angel, a Buffy spin-off.  In this series, his name is John, but he mostly plays it like Spike anyway, and I wondered at first if he could be anyone else.  But we see new sides to his character eventually, and in Caprica 1.0 and 1.5, he shows up yet again, looking a little older and chubbier, but much darker, and without all the smirky stuff.  As it happens, we have been watching Caprica, Torchwood 2 and the final season of Angel during the same months, and it really seemed like he was always going to be present.

In Season 1 episode 1, we are introduced to the Torchwood team, though not their background, with the exception of Gwen, who at that time is a police officer.  We learn how it is that she comes to be part of the team, and see how she changes.  Near the end of Season 2, there is an episode that does a nice job introducing three other characters, how Jack met them, and how they changed on joining the team.  Jack remains a bit of an enigma, though there are enough bits tossed out to get the general idea of his unusual background.  The storyline involving James Masters gives us more important information.

We often watch the show with English subtitles.  Part of it is the rather thick Welsh-English accent employed by some characters, part of it is to study the interesting turns of phrase in their local vernacular.

It's hard to discuss this series much more without getting into spoilers.  I'll just comment that I like it when shows are willing to portray events that force the show to change dramatically, and this one does that: it sets the scene for change in Children of Earth, a.k.a. Season 3.  I'm looking forward to it!

Why four stars?  This is a very good and entertaining show, but I reserve five stars for my all-time favorites, and there are better shows than this out there.  Four stars means ""I like it"" and from me that is a very positive review.",1329955200,2,2719,4.428571428571429

I suppose I could put my first comment in a review of Kindle Fire, but this show made me REALLY wish I had a fast forward.  From the repeated intro for every episope, even into season two, at the beginning then an actual intro a few min. in.
So many of the plot lines were so rife with holes that there seemed little work was put into writting as the cgi budget and sexual agenda were the real priorities.
Then, as the others talk mildly about, there is the graphic and less than even casual depiction of sex, for everyone, not just Jack.  Being fan of the Doctor,  I wanted to keep up with the universe.  However, you must be prepared for people with such little regard for anything that they sleep with everything, and I do mean everything.  Such little respect for real relationships does little to change stereotypes of sexual proclivities outside monogamous heterosexual couples.  I am not narrowminded enough to say everyone has even the remotest similar motivation for choosing other lifestyles, but this certainly feeds my belief that most of us humans make choices that are based on selfish, ""I feel good "" reasoning, not biological or what is best for humanity or even oneself.  For being a spin-off of a show that has made us think for so long, I wish I had an amnesia pill from Jack so I could forget Torchwood.  You may dismiss me as a prude American, and that's fine, but as I near 40,  I realize that the third of my life spent in Europe did not add to my satisfaction as a complete person as much as my beliefs.
To sum it up,  if you like cutting edge tv that makes having any sexual values seem so yesterday,  then this is the show for you.  If you define cutting edge as thin sci-fi plots chopped full of nudity and random encounters in the sack with any passersby, male female or alien,  this is for you, not me.",1328140800,7,1984,4.7492711370262395

What we get instead is a poorly sketched episode with clunky special effects more at home in low budget Bollywood horror movies, and a couple of thrusts at extending the story arc of Torchwood, which seems to be casting for direction mid-way through the second season.

A spin-off of the hugely successful Doctor Who series, Torchwood follows the adventures of Captain Jack Harkness (played by the wonderfully gifted actor John Barrowman); Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), a former constable who is recruited by Jack; Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori), Torchwood Cardiff's computer genius; Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), the Torchwood medical examiner; and Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd), Torchwood's resident guard, coffeemaker, and Captain Jack's closest friend within Torchwood.

One of the things I like most about this second season is that it does not disappoint when it comes to the action and suspense: there is plenty of that to go around!  There are more aliens and bigger explosions, but creator Russell T. Davies manages to weave in a very fascinating story around these elements as well.  As the Doctor would say, ""Brilliant!""

3111109,5,B0013GS3WW,"Wonderfully entertaining British TV series. Torchwood's main character, Captain Jack Harkness, got his start on an episode of Dr. Who, and the new series took off from there. If you ever wished that Dr. Who was grittier and sexier, this is the place to be.

Yes, Jack is bisexual, so if that disturbs you, then Torchwood is probably not the best viewing choice. The handling of sexuality in the series is matter-of-fact, and certainly a lot less graphic than, say, True Blood. Given some of the language and the dark tone of the stories, I wouldn't recommend this show to very young viewers; they would enjoy Dr. Who more anyway. I DO recommend the show to anyone looking for adult science fiction. Why is it that British television can handle this type of show so well compared to us?",1299369600,24,785,4.64748201438849

I love the Torchwood series.  I just hate the blatant tones of homosexuality in a view episodes.  Otherwise, I would give the show five stars.",1299283200,7,405,4.181818181818182

3111112,5,B0013GS3WW,"I've only been a fan of ""Doctor Who"" for a couple of years, but I became hooked almost immediately.  When I learned that it had generated two spin-off series, I was interested.  ""Torchwood"" centers around Captain Jack Harkness, one of the Doctor's fromer companions, and his team at the Torchwood Institute, introduced during Sesaon Two of ""Doctor Who.""  They are charged with defending the Earth in the Doctor's absence.  This series has a darker tone than ""Doctor Who,"" but it's still very thrilling.",1289865600,,502,5.0120481927710845
3111113,4,B0013GS3WW,"In my review for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-season-of-Torchwood/dp/B000VWE5OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first season of Torchwood</a>&nbsp;I concluded that the show had plenty of potential in regards to its setup, actors and production values, but which was obviously struggling to find its feet. A reliance on shock value, some sloppy scripts, and the inclusion of several unlikable main characters weakened the final product, though not so much that I wasn't intrigued by the possibility of these mistakes being rectified in the following season.

And for the most part, they are. Season two is aware of its past faults and makes an effort to fix them. The stories are less predictable and manage to be more fun and more serious at the same time. Characters are better developed, and the annoying qualities of Gwen and Owen have been toned down (though not eradicated). And rather than relying on singular episodes there is more of an overarching plot at work that allows for more depth in the storytelling.

A spin-off of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B000E41MS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>&nbsp;that purports to be more ""adult"", Torchwood is the name of a not-so-secret organization that deals with the aliens, time-travelers and other anomalies that emerge through the Rift in space and time that it situated right over the city of Cardiff, Wales. The team is lead by the charming, enigmatic and impossible-to-kill Captain Jack Harkness, and made up of policewoman Gwen Cooper, computer-technician Toshiko Sato, medical doctor Owen Harper and faithful butler Ianto Jones. Making a pseudo-family of sorts, the colleges deal with the strange occurrences that threaten the city and its inhabitants.

And of strange occurrences there are many, including a familiar face from Jack's past out to cause trouble, alien sleepers planning an invasion, a cryogenically frozen soldier from the first world war, an alien that can seamlessly integrate himself into memories, a stranded alien whale, shape-shifters, creepy side-show performers that emerge from old film reels, and a range of civilian disappearances.  For the most part the stories are well written and convincingly acted, and although some are certainly better than others, none of them are unwatchable.

But it's the human element that makes the second season an improvement on its predecessor. Every character is given more depth and background, and the actors seem a lot more settled in their roles. Gwen is far more useful and her much-vaunted empathy is actually shown rather than just harped on. Owen is still abrasive and arrogant, but at least his repugnant qualities have been significantly lessoned. The writers choose to deal with Owen and Gwen's affair by completely ignoring it (a little strange, but neither characters' finest moment, and so probably for the best). Tosh and Ianto are given more screen-time, and stories of their own.

Most of all, we learn more about the mysterious Captain Jack, first introduced in Doctor Who as a con-artist from the 51st century. There are plenty of insights into his life, including his childhood in the distant future, the loss of his little brother Grey, his time-traveling back into the Victorian era and his initial recruitment into Torchwood at the hands of some rather sassy 19th century ladies. The more we know, the more intriguing he becomes. In an extended flashback episode, we also learn how the three original members of Jack's team were brought together as a team, whether it was frightening, tragic or humorous. Midway through the series, one of the team-members goes through a (literally) life-changing experience, which changes our entire preconceptions of this character and how he operates within the group - and in fact, life itself.

There's also a plethora of guest stars that add color and interest to the usual routine. Fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer/dp/B000AQ68RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>&nbsp;will instantly recognize James Marsters as Captain John Hart, a fellow time agent and a foil to our Jack, whose true feelings and motivations are left slightly murky throughout his appearances. Martha Jones from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B000UVV2GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>&nbsp;stops by, significantly more grown-up and professional as a UNIT member and qualified doctor who lends her services to the team for a three-episode arc. And I have a soft-spot for Rhys, Gwen's befuddled fianc who finally finds out the truth about his partner's job and reacts in quite a touching way. In many ways Rhys exemplifies the ""everyman"" far more than Gwen does, and when he steps up to the plate (with a chainsaw, no less), it's worth a round of applause.

Altogether, I definitely enjoyed this season more than the last, though it continues to irritate me that the Torchwood team always seems to come across as a group of very smart people doing very stupid things. Despite Jack's opening narrative: ""Torchwood is ready,"" nothing could be further from the truth. This is not a team of professionals, but a few individuals recruited as much for their dysfunctional natures as their skills. Whether this makes them all the more endearing or just plain irritating usually depends on the context of the story they're in and the quality of the episode. As always, the DVD is packed full of supplementary material, including outtakes, deleted scenes, a featurette on Jack, and an in-depth look at all the episodes.

3111121,4,B0013GS3WW,"""Torchwood"" is a British science fiction series and a spin off to the unnaturally popular ""Doctor Who"". Indeed, the name Torchwood is actually an anagram of Doctor Who.

""Doctor Who"" is a very quaint series, often bordering the intentionally ridiculous, and although styled as a family show, it's probably best suited for kids around 13 years of age. The main character, the Doctor, is a immortal, shape shifting space alien who battles evil robots and mad scientists, while roaming the universe in a time machine disguised as a phone boot (!).

""Torchwood"", by contrast, was marketed as a more adult series. It does contain more sex, violence and general mayhem, and the characters all seem to suffer from constant neuroses. To all intents and purposes, however, it's really a kind of ""Doctor Who for adults"". The evil aliens may be more violent, but they are just as comical (or involuntarily comical) as the aliens in ""Doctor Who"". Don't miss the fat lady dressed in green who turns out to be a monster with strange breeding habits. Or the monster insects from outer space who can cure AIDS. Or the Weevils, a bunch of bizarre aliens who for reasons unknown live in the...wait for it...sewers of Cardiff. Why not move to a public housing estate?

The human characters, with their strange depressions, also come across as a bunch of funny weirdos. I mean, one of them runs around half of season two in mint zombie condition. The leader of the Torchwood team, Captain Jack, is an immortal bisexual. His gay boyfriend has the usual penchant for fashionwear. And then there's Tosh, a Japanese computer geek madly and sadly in love with the zombie.

Well, at least they have diversity on this show!

The first time a saw ""Torchwood"", I considered it really bad. I guess I didn't see the comic potential. If you take this show with a large grain of salt, you may actually enjoy some of the episodes.

Then, you don't have to torch Torchwood.

If you don't know, BBC-A severely edited the episodes, both to make them ""fit the timeslot"" and for content.  I was *NOT* impressed that Amazon didn't state that the set was the edited versions.  But it turns out they're not!  Despite what the cover says, these are the full, original, unedited versions of the Torchwood Series 2 episodes.  Season 2 starts with the team (minus Jack, still MIA)chasing some crazy looking fish-headed alien through the streets of Cardiff and doesn't ever slow down.

And why on Earth does BBC have to put the theme song and clip of the cast walking along in front of every episode?  Very annoying.  If there is a third season I will not buy it.",1263168000,16,498,4.384615384615385
3111126,3,B0013GS3WW,"The first season was brilliant with clever plots, good acting and really interesting characters. The problems lies with the unfortunate ubiquitous ""humanizing"" of heroes - a common problem for all SF/fantasy/horros TV series. The writers start introducing more emotions, more love lines, more siblings problems and suffering and move from ""the city and the monsters"" show (which is interesting) into the ""sex, city and a bit of monsters - when we have time for them"". The overly rich emotional life of the heroes just bores to death. As much as I loved the first season, I am not sure even if I want to watch the ""children of earth"" - if it continues in the same direction. If anyone knows a good urban SF show that does not slide into the countless close ups of faces ""ravaged by tears of grief"", please give a hint. What happened to the authors sense of humor?",1263081600,,862,4.640522875816994
3111127,4,B0013GS3WW,"When one takes into account what Russell T. Davies has done with his iteration of the Whoniverse, it becomes apparent that he has created--to this point--a triangle between ""Doctor Who"", ""The Sarah Jane Adventures"", and ""Torchwood"" with The Doctor being the apex/midpoint between the other two.  ""Sarah Jane""--because its home is BBC Kids--seems a little more buoyant, obviously aiming for its younger audience.  ""Torchwood"" is the punch in the mouth--it isn't pretty, it isn't nice, and sometimes the good guys don't get total victories.
  This is part of the theme of Series 2--and if one gets antsy with ""unclean wins"", so be it.  As I said about Series 1, Torchwood is a dark, somewhat cracked reflection of Doctor Who.  It isn't hard to see John Barrowman's Jack Harkness as what The Doctor would be if all his flaws were brought to the fore and his desires laid public.  Nor is it hard to not see that Eve Myles' Gwen Cooper as a Companion with a few more skills...and complications to her life and to Captain Jack's.  The ways that Burn Gorman, Nakano Mori and Gareth Lloyd-Davies fill out the team compliment the lead taken by Barrowman and Myles, as well as the flaws they exhibit.  Barrowman has a pulse on the nature of Jack--who is far more of a serious sort than when he was introduced--and Myles brings a wonderful energy and depth to Gwen, attempting to balance her life with Torchwood Three with her impending nuptials with Rhys Williams; to say nothing of what happens when Rhys (Wonderfully played with the element of Archie Bunker as a jealous lover by Kai Owen) finds out what Gwen has been doing with her nights.
  Still, this season is a complicated story, and the story starts when James Marsters shows up in the opening episode, ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"".  There seems to be an unspoken rule with science fiction on both sides of the Atlantic--if you need a slightly over-the-top, trash-talking gray area character then find The Artist Formerly Known as Spike.  Marsters wonderfully embodies Captain John Hart, Jack's former partner (and lover) in the Time Agency; and his appearance sets in motion much of the twists and turns of the season.  So does Freema Agyeman's three-episode visit in the middle of this set as Martha Jones, during which the first severe turn occurs within Torchwood Three with Owen Harper's murder and regeneration, how the team adjusts to an already grumpy medical specialist who suddenly cannot enjoy eating, sleeping, or boinking.  I always felt that they never gave enough time in the series to Mori, who brought a considerable warmth and longing to Toshiko Sato, ultimately not fulfilled.  Her turn in ""To The Last Man"" was a wonderful and sad performance, and really came to embody the heartache in Tosh's life.  There is really not much done with Ianto through the second series--save the explanation of how he came to Torchwood Three in ""Fragments""--but it seems as if much of who he is is saved for ""Children Of Earth""...and the one scene with Barrowman and Myles that left me more than a little squeamish...
  Still, through the drama and pain--""To The Last Man"" and ""Adam"" embody much of the angst that goes unspoken between the members--to the action and slightly humorous moments of ""Something Borrowed""...the sense of something going horribly wrong is there, and gets fulfilled in ""Fragments"" and ""Exit Wounds"".  These two episodes, combined with the ""Children Of Earth"" miniseries, led many to suspect that Torchwood wouldn't be returning in 2010 when Series 5 of Doctor Who started...but that doesn't seem to be the case.
  This set is a tough, hard series of episodes; a crime drama that is more visceral and gritty than the series it was born from.  It's supposed to be that way.  It can be a little over-the-top--but so, very much so, is the series that it was drawn from.  And taken as what it is--the dark side of The Doctor's Universe--it fits the bill.  I consider this set to be highly enjoyable, and I recommend it because Torchwood--as an anthology--is a very good work in progress, with room to get better.",1261526400,2,4079,4.833093525179856
3111128,2,B0013GS3WW,"I bought seasons 1 & 2 of the show because I like Dr. Who. But I was up for a disappointment. The episodes' stories, in and of themselves, are very poor. Furthermore, the basic idea of the show: the superagency protecting us from the dangers of the Universe, is faltering at every step. The team members are often reduced to simple registrars of unfolding events over which they have little or no control. The agents are incompetent and easy to break their professional duty.

On top of it, as if it is not bad enough, the show becomes a kind of ""a relationship movie"", creating a strong flavor of a soap opera. Everyone sleeps with everyone else, regardless of sex, and, at later times, some parties are upset about that. As the show progresses, the scenes become more explicit, with strong emphasis on homosexuality. This is quite unexpected and rhyme poorly with the overall context of the show.

Did some people object I wonder?  It used to be,  ""Torchwood.  Outside the government, beyond the police. Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future. The 21st century is when everything changes. And you got to be ready.""

This season Russell Davies and Co have gotten rid of the arming humans part.  A gesture towards pacifism?  ""Torchwood.  Outside the government, beyond the police. Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race. The 21st century is when everything changes. And Torchwood is ready.""  See, they've even changed the last few words.  When before it was ""You've got to be ready,"" now we find out that we needn't bother taking arms against the alien invaders, since Torchwood has it covered.

And yet, as other reviewers have noticed, Torchwood ain't ready for nothin!  If I was a drinking man, I would play my own game, every time Captain Jack's eyes well up with close-up tears, I'd have a shot of some Welsh liquor, and I'd still be drunk.  Everyone's emotional, which is cool I guess, but sometimes it all gets a bit much, especially given that all five leads are grieving for a love that's lost to them now by death or other malfeasance, so their energies seem often lost in the past, like the heroes of Marcel Proust, so that aliens slip by them like nuns past the blind man.  In this season Gwen and Rhys finally get married, and even better Rhys is let into the secrets of Torchwood, and that is fortunate, sicne the Famous 5 start to get out of their self-absorbed melancholia and start seeing things as Rhys sees them--how preposterous they are.

In a way, I liked the shock ending, but in another way, it makes me feel like the next season probably won't be that good.  But I've been wrong before and I hope that ""Children of Earth"" proves me wrong.  By the way, does any other TW fan feel that Jack's little brother, Gray, is possibly the worst actor ever given a apeaking part in the history of TV?  Maybe in Wales his acting is acclaimed, but here I feel my IKEA nightstand could act rings around Gray, though he's cute, sort of.",1244937600,2,2251,4.554726368159204
3111146,1,B0013GS3WW,"I loved ""Who"" and have watched both spin-offs; this and Sarah Jane Adventures.

At first Torchwood was original, intriguing with a good group of actors. That would be this Season. But don't let yourself get hooked! Season two takes a horrible turn for the worse.

In season 2 it seams the writers are trying to make sure every character ""bats for both teams"" and everyone sleeps with just about everyone.

I'm not a homo-phobe: there are questions about my dad who still rooms with the same guy he left my mom for. My husband has a cousin everyone wishes would come out. It is part of our world today.

But this show makes it seem like it is natural for everyone to change their minds. Take the butler like guy. In the first season he is pining over his girlfriend that he's hidden in the basement. She's half robot.

Season II:

He and the Captain become lovers.

It was my understanding that either you are or you aren't. You don't just wake up one day and decide to swap teams.

Add to this that the main character, the girl - I'm really bad with names - who is shacking up with her boyfriend. She decides to have a romance with one of the guys in Torchwood. It seems every other episode is about who's doing who.

Although on the other hand having Jack and Gwen solving mysteries on their own like Doctor Who would be a very copycat thing to do.

John Barrowman who plays Captain Jack is magnetic.  Talk about charisma!  No wonder the others follow him even though they know very little about him.  For me Torchwood first and second seasons have been about knowing more about Captain Jack.
Dr. Who has never interested me that much.  Sometimes I watch some of the new Dr. Who on PBS.  I can take Dr. Who or leave it though the new Dr. Who is an interesting character too.
I am mesmerized by Captain Jack though.  He is the man all men want to be with -- straight or gay.

3111170,5,B0013GS3WW,"I'm a science fiction fan -- been afflicted since I read my first Robert Heinlein book at the age of 8 (and that's a scary number of years ago).  When BBC-America began running Torchwood about 2 years ago, I was hooked after the first episode.

Of course, it didn't hurt that I was already familiar with the central character, Capt. Jack Harkness, from his appearances on Dr. Who, another BBC series that had wormed its way into my heart.  And it didn't hurt that John Barrowman, scores a 9-1/2 on the handsome scale, or that his character is able to hold his sense of humor in the fact of death and destruction.  However, the most important part of the first episode is that all of the characters were fully formed and ready to interact with themselves and their world.

The characters are fascinating; Gwen is the heart of the cast, an ex?-police officer with a sensitivity to both humans and monsters that they meat, whereas Owen, the doctor, is the opposite rude, callous, and unable to form a lasting relationship with anyone.  Toshiko (""Tosh"") is a shy genius with an amazing touch with computers, hacking in wherever she needs to find what she needs.  Finally, there's Ianto, with, as Jack once says, his ""beautiful Welsh vowels,"" another shy man who started off as the ""receptionist"" and liaison with the outside world.  Finally, there's Cardiff, a city with a personality like no one has ever seen before -- Strongly Welsh with a modern overlay.

Watch a couple episodes.  You'll find yourself as intrigued as I have become, and, no matter what your sexual orientation, probably in love with one or more of the characters, as well as the city and the delightful, scary, sad, funny, and brilliant monsters that you'll come across in each episode.",1223769600,4,1754,4.740131578947368

3111175,4,B0013GS3WW,"It's yet another season of ""Torchwood"", a ""Doctor Who"" for adults.  Now in its 2nd season, we meet a team of professionals who battle aliens and try to protect us from all sorts of cosmic anomalies.  Based in Cardiff - centrally located on a rift in time and space - ""Torchwood"" stands ready to do the job.  With plenty of foul language and sexual...um...stuff, you never forget the seriousness of the situation, or the fact that the end of the world never means having to forego a good ""snog"".

""Torchwood"" remains a pretty controversial show.  Everything that made the 1st season both fun and frustrating are ramped up in S2.

But first, the ep.s themselves.
""Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang""  (I wonder how many British shows have come and gone wishing to use that title.)  Remember how S1 built up the anticipation to that same sex kiss in ""Captain Jack Harkness""?  Well, subtlety goes out the window in the first few minutes of the season opener, returning Jack from his adventure in the ""Doctor Who"" season 2 finale.  Here, Jack introduces the team to his thrill-kill former colleague and not-so-former lover, Time-Agent Captain Jon Hart.  What is Hart's agenda?  And how much lip-lock will the team be forced to watch before Jack takes any action?

""Sleeper"", an obvious idea nevertheless not given the treatment until now.  The team must confront deep-cover terrorist insurgents from another planet.  They look like ordinary people - husbands, wives, lovers, parents - but when the signal starts, they become indestructible agents of mass destruction.

""To the Last Man"", a pretty good episode in which the team finds a breakdown in time barriers between the present and WWI era threaten the space-time continuum.  Only an inhabitant of that period, sent back to his time from our own, can save the universe.  Luckily, Torchwood has kept a WWI soldier on ice since 1918 for just such an occasion.  TV shows (especially cop shows) are typically weak because they marginalize guest stars, but this ep. shows how Torchwood excels in integrating guest characters into its larger mythos.

""Meat"".  An episode that gives the vegans a chance (among many) to laugh at us carnivores.  The team investigates a meatpacking operation profiting on the flesh of apparently alien source.  The story itself is pretty thin, but as with many eps. the saving grace is the character interaction - chiefly involving Rhys, Gwen's annoying fiance.

""Adam"".  Who's Adam?  Nobody seems to think that Adam has been anything but a longtime and loyal teammate, so nobody seems to realize that he just insinuated himself into the group and their memories.  At first helpful, the script reveals how darkly dangerous a man with memory-altering powers can be.  A great episode that reveals more background on Capt. Jack and also informs how much they care about each other.

""Reset"" what would sci-fi be without a dig at the medical establishment?  This was actually a weak story punctuated by a great appearance from Alan Dale (known in the US for ""Lost"" and ""Ugly Betty""), the debut in Torchwood of ""Doctor Who"" vet Martha Jones (which provides for much cheerily licentious dialog) and a thoroughly heartbreaking ending.

""Dead Man Walking"" picks up where ""Reset"" left off.  The facts of the story substantially nullifies the tragedy that ended ""Reset"" without damaging the other episode's dramatic payoff.  (Can't say anything else w/o a substantial spoiler.)  The episode is the midway to the conclusive ""A Day in the Death"".  Again, spoilfree review guidelines prevent more specific description.  Suffice it to say that this ep. is ""Random Shoes"" of the season, only better than that ep.

""Something Borrowed"" has Gwen and Rhys finally tying the knot.  Only, a late night duel-to-the-death with a shape-shifting alien carnivore leaves Gwen in a compromising position that threatens to ruin the wedding.  Funny, scary and still very adult, this is easily one of the show's more entertaining eps.

""From Out of the Rain"" has Cardiff menaced by ""Night Travelers"", performers of a ghostly circus that steals the breath of ordinary human beings.  A decidedly creepy ep. with a disappointing payoff.

""Adrift"" a horrible story.  Gwen follows up on a large volume of missing-person cases possibly tied to The Rift.  In bonding to many civilians in search of missing loved ones, Gwen's makes some pretty obvious and painful errors in judgment.  Anybody who thought last season's episodes ""Small Worlds"" and ""Out of Time"" were pointless will probably feel the same way about ""Adrift"".

""Fragments"" a great episode in which a crisis situation forces each of our heroes to separately delve into their past and recall how they joined Torchwood.  Best part of the episode: Jack meets Torchwood's saucy Victorian era operatives.  This ep. sets the stage for the season finale -""Exit Wounds"".  It's very difficult to discuss the finale w/o spoilers.  Let's just say that it involves Captain Jon and Jack's lost brother, Gray, and basically ends with final heartbreak for the team.  Unfortunately, it also follows too closely the 3rd season finale of Doctor Who, with the emotional confrontation between hero and villain.

WHAT'S WRONG W/TORCHWOOD?
Torchwood never fully becomes the adult version of Doctor Who.  Too many ideas are developed without a payoff (the ""Night Travellers"" being an obvious example; the show eerily introduces them, then quickly discards them); also, the show falls into the trap of so quickly assuming its maturity based on sexual content & bad language, that it sometimes leaves fatally obvious signs of its lineage to ""that other show"", itself originally a kid's show.  It takes more than a profusion of potty language and a healthy diet of ""snogging"", to elevate ""Torchwood"" to maturity - think of kids playing ""dress-up"" and you get the idea.  The other flaw is in the premise, but it's a somewhat complicated flaw.  Watching the show, it's hard to get past the idea that ""Torchwood"" is often more in need of help than capable of providing.  Their position often makes them vulnerable to otherworldly threats - despite Captain Jack's weekly refrain, ""Torchwood"" is NOT ready.

WHAT IS IRRESISTIBLE
But that premise actually the show's saving grace - the vulnerability of Jack, Ianto, Owen, Tosh and (especially) Gwen is the biggest reason for the show's appeal.  The script works in well just how close these guys get to getting offed on a weekly basis, trading witty and well-timed banter even as half the cosmos wants them dead.

I did not come to it via Dr Who (which I've never really liked all that much except as some campy fun in small does... sorry Dr Who fans).  Season 1 of Torchwood was great, if uneven in places, although the various character story arcs meant that even in the sub-par episodes there was still good meat for the character development of the team.

In season two, the main stories and the character development became much more cohesive and exciting.  Like all good sci-fi shows, Torchwood made us care about the characters while all the supernatural weirdness was happening around them.  Everyone got their own story trajectory that developed nicely over the season.  This was useful because by the time you get to the last episode, you will have a strong emotional response to how the series ends (sorry, no spoilers... but bring kleenex).

I would recommend watching the first season first, however, as the longstanding story arcs are best understood as developed from season 1.

Season 2 hangs together very well, and some of the episodes are incredibly exciting and touching.  It is really fun sci-fi, with some very interesting innovative takes on the whole 'secret society fighting aliens' genre.

The show also makes more tie-ins with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B000E41MS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>.

The first season was all over the place, stretching and sending each character into a million and one places. They were testing the waters and finding out who each character was and how far he or she would go. Now, the show has found its soul (corny I know...). Each episode of this season was darker and edgier as each explored an aspect of each of the characters and the interactions between them. Each character is more consitently written and the show itself shows more consistency.

We learn more about the creation of Torchwood and how Jack came to be where he is now. We also get Freema Agyeman reprising her role of Martha Jones for a 3-episode arch. She is such a good character!

The show is definitely better, definitely worth watching.",1215734400,40,1436,5.764150943396227
3344877,5,B0013GS3WW,"I reluctantly started watching Doctor Who a couple years ago and was instantly hooked. Then I met Captain Jack. I was in love! When I found out he was having his own series, I just HAD to watch. I was not disappointed! Season one was amazing as an introduction to the group. But season 2 was almost a coming of age season for every cast member. I laughed and cried and came back for more! I cant wait to get season 2!",1212364800,5,417,4.097560975609756
3344878,5,B0013GS3WW,"This season of Torchwood was epic.  All the episodes were awesome and I cant wait untill it comes out on DVD.  This season was comparable to the first season, you learn alot more about the cast in this season, and the finale leaves us on the edge wondering what they are going to do for the third season =)",1208908800,5,306,4.169491525423729
3344879,5,B0013GS3WW,Season Two has to be by far the best of the two seasons. It has action and everything else you would expect from Torchwood. Apart from some very sad moments (will not list the spoilers) this season was great.,1208736000,3,208,4.358974358974359
3344880,5,B0013GS3WW,"I had been such a fan of the X-Files that, when my girlfriend told me this BBC series was a sort of British Scully-and-Mulder, I was a bit miffed. I got her the first season, became completely hooked, and now eagerly await the show on Saturday nights.

While I can't possibly match the detail of the first reviewer, I'll just note that I thought the ""Adam"" episode was truly creepy and one of their best; the whole concept of substitute memories was extremely well handled. Really, though, I have enjoyed all of them.

If you like sci-fi or the paranormal, you owe it to yourself to at least check it out.",1206576000,11,605,4.441441441441442
3344881,5,B0013GS3WW,"Honestly, the only reason I started watching the show was because I thought John Barrowman was hot lol. Even though I heard negative reviews about it, I decided to watch it and judge for myself. I was pleasantly surprised with the show. Granted season 1 wasn't perfect but it had a lot of great moments. It had a lot of hits and misses but it was highly entertaining for the most part.

Now season 2 is absolutely fantastic! Much better than season 1. The show's dynamic has changed noticeably and the characters have become much more likable and fun. The story lines are more mature and interesting. Everything has been taken to a new level and the result has been great!
I can't wait to get my hands on the Season 2 DVD. The first season DVD was loaded with special features and I'm hoping this one would be the same. Every episode had commentaries, it's own behind the scenes look and miniature interviews with the cast and crew. It also included many deleted scenes and bloopers. But honestly, I would buy the DVD even if it didn't come with any extra material because the episodes this season have been really good.",1205971200,33,1120,4.544554455445544

3345000,4,B0013GS3WW,I love the Brits and there shows! I started watching this series because of how good Dr Who was and I haven't been disappointed. I like the characters and the storyline keeps me interested. They intertwine the episodes so that you don't lose interest. The one little downer is they try to sneak in a little bit of sexual situations where they don't fit but other than that it's a pretty good season 2.,1469836800,,401,4.4324324324324325

Owen stays reincarnated too long and I didn't buy the premise of his animation. Tosh doesn't seem all that smart, not that she isn't but she doesn't seem to have smart issues. The whole time I'm watching I'm being distracted by who is attracted to whom and why. Gwen is in love with her boyfriend? No chemistry there and the chemistry between Gwen and Jack is over the top. I can't remember the plot for the season but I have visuals I can't get rid of everybody's partner. Owen: didn't like actor or character.",1468627200,,659,4.32258064516129

3345026,4,B0013GS3WW,"I really like the Torchwood Series Season 2. It is kind of silly but that is part of the charm. Just a cool fantasy show that makes for a great distraction from everyday life. In my opinion Torchwood is kind of a cross between Warehouse 13, the X-Files, and all those CSI shows. I have watched this entire series several times and I wish it would not have been as short lived as it was. I was able to watch Torchwood for FREE as part of my Amazon Prime membership. I had never even heard of it before it showed up on a suggestion list from Amazon. I am so glad I did find it.

So if you remotely liked Warehouse 13 or the X-Files you will more then likely enjoy this show.

3345179,5,B0013GS3WW,"Season 2 Includes 13 Episodes on 4 discs and a surprising Disc 5 called 'Torchwood Declassified'  As we have come to expect there were no jumps or skips in either the sound or the video.  Another quality production.

Episode List:
DISC 1;
1 ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang""
A conflicted Torchwood team is surprised to see Captain Jack suddenly return to their lives, and though he tries to come back as if nothing happened Jack soon finds that some things have changed since his disappearance. There's little time for explanations, though, as a mysterious stranger from Jack's past steps through the rift, and he's on a mission that only the Torchwood team can help him finish. But it becomes quickly clear that Captain John Hart is not all he claims to be, and as usual, Captain Jack Harkness has some secrets of his own.

2 ""Sleeper""
When a burglary turns into a slaughter, Torchwood suspect alien involvement. Who is Beth, and can she be as innocent as she seems? However, when the investigation escalates into a city-wide assault, Captain Jack realises that the whole planet is in danger.

3 ""To the Last Man""
Every year since 1918, the team wakes Tommy from cryogenic sleep, because one day they will need his help. But they don't know which year, or for what. All indications are sealed in a box that will only open at the right moment.

DISC2;
4 ""Meat""
Conflicts abound when a truck owned by Rhys's trucking company is investigated by Torchwood... and Rhys is there to see it. The meat it carries is tainted, or is it even meat at all? Rhys does a little investigating of his own, and might have something to contribute to the team this time around. But he's no longer sure who he can trust anymore. And can Gwen and the team trust him?

5 ""Adam""
Adam, an alien in the guise of a personable young man, is a 'memory manipulator' who implants false memories into the Torchwood team, leading them to believe he is an old friend. Gwen is induced to forget Rhys and Jack recalls painful memories of his brother before he exposes Adam. The team take tablets to restore their memories, in the process 'killing' Adam, who fades away.

6 ""Reset""
Jack persuades Martha Jones to go undercover at the Pharm, a sinister research facility, which is experimenting in the drug 'Reset', releasing alien parasites into the body to 'reset' it and cure disease. She is exposed by the Pharm's head, Dr. Copley and injected with Reset before the Torchwood team ride to her rescue.

7 ""Dead Man Walking""
Jack acquires the other Resurrection Glove to bring Owen momentarily back from the dead. However, Owen does not become fully dead again - even though his body is physically dead, some unknown force keeps him reanimated. And he's becoming less human...

DISC 3;
8 ""A Day in the Death""
Owen's been dead for three days and finds it unbearable. He meets a woman contemplating jumping off a roof and reveals that there is nothing after death. He then tells the woman how he ended up coming to the roof.

9 ""Something Borrowed""
Friday night: Gwen's late for her own hen party. This is because she's been chasing a man-eating shape-shifter, which bites her before Jack shoots it. Saturday morning: Wedding day. Gwen wakes up heavily pregnant.

10 ""From Out of the Rain""
An old movie theatre, The Electro, has been restored and is opening as a museum. Ianto used to go there as a child and invites Owen and Gwen to the opening. Jack hears faint music, like pipe organ, at Torchwood. Then the movie projector somehow plays a different film than the one on the reel. Ianto sees Jack in the movie, in a traveling show. Then the projector stops. Two characters from the movie disappear into the night...

DISC 4;
11 ""Adrift""
When a local teenager disappears Gwen is drawn into an investigation that reveals a darker side of Torchwood. Hundreds of people have disappeared without trace, but why is Jack obstructing attempts to find them? The answer seems to lie in the rift, and as Gwen follows the trail she makes a shocking discovery.

12 ""Fragments""
As the team is trapped in the rubble of a building, their paths to joining Torchwood are revealed.

13 ""Exit Wounds""
When the villainous Captain John Hart returns to abduct Captain Jack Harkness whilst unleashing a wave of destruction and terror upon an unsuspecting Cardiff, it's up to Gwen, Ianto, Owen and Tosh to save the day. Meanwhile, Captain Jack Harkness is forced to face some demons from his past.

3345189,5,B0013GS3WW,"I love Torchwood for so many different reasons. The main one being that the writers aren't afraid to push the envelope. My first exposure to Torchwood was with Children of Earth. I think I watched the entire series in one sitting. It was definitely one of these series where I found myself saying to myself ""no, they won't do that"", and then they do. While Children of Earth and the following series Miracle Day all follow one storyline, Season 1 and 2 are more individual stores each episode with character development built up during the series.

Season 2 focuses heavily on each character, their past as well as their future. Season 1 is left on with Jack missing and Season 2 starts with his return and the consequences as well as a returning time agent who becomes the antagonist of the season. While the first episode of Season 1 reveals how Gwen became part of Torchwood, Season 2 shows the stories of how Tosh, Ianto and Owen were recruited. Martha Jones makes a guest appearance in several episodes and there are heartbreaking changes in the Torchwood team.",1456444800,5,1066,4.7005347593582885

Also, some of the acting is weak, especially by the lead female.  The homosexual lead character, Captain Jack, is handsome and if there is going to be sex and romance, it is too bad he is not a lady's man.  So there.",1417824000,,439,4.329268292682927
3345221,5,B0013GS3WW,"I like sci/fy so Torchwood fits the bill. I like that their protagonist isn't always the same (like in Dr. Who) so it keeps the story fresh, and often times surprising - so good writers (kudos). Torchwood also addresses social issues very naturally - like you never know who Jack is going to find attractive - a male or female. Or who he might kiss - usually male (and not some pansy kiss - but a real passionate male/male french kiss), but makes it all very natural as part of the story as if a man and woman were kissing naturally as part of the story. There are other social themes like this, that are woven in as part of the story, so it all feels natural and very lifelike. I love the actors, their characters, the storyline. I'm not much of a TV watcher - I see it on Netflix or Amazon Prime - and watch when I'm back from international travel and need a few days to veg and rest.

Captain Jack was a better character in Dr. Who than he is in Torchwood. He and his team seem to have only two emotions: anger and sex. The plot lines are truncated in most episodes.

3345243,2,B0013GS3WW,"Honestly... it's getting worse.  I am SO ANNOYED at programs who fail to provide continuity.  There are so many holes in the entire series that it has become a running joke to search them all out but now each and every show is riddled with mistakes.  The most recent one (just for me anyhow) was an episode where aliens were inhabiting ""human"" bodies and that the needles and syringes kept breaking on the person's skin yet... a bullet and car crash killed them.  COME ON!!!!  Please make up your minds on what's going on.  Plus as a watcher of Dr. Who I know background on Captain Jack and his story is totally off.  He spoke of being a child on Earth and now he had flashbacks of an alien plant in the future.  Yes, it may have been a false memory but it's still just lame.  And the constant nasty sex that everyone seems to have with absolutely no feelings of jealousy are ridiculous.  What are they?  Barn animals who just happen to co-mingle with everything in their path?  Real human beings cannot just bop each other with no subsequent feelings.  And their insistence on shoving their political views down the throats of their audience is pathetic.  They can't even keep that straight.  Either there is no Heaven or Hell or there is a Hell with something in the darkness lurking over you (like they have now said in multiple episodes).  Pick one and stick with it.

Of course watching Barrowman flirt and kiss is my favorite part of the series. In this season you finally find out about the other members and how they came to Torchwood.

3345284,4,B0013GS3WW,"Season 2 is Torchwood hitting its stride in terms of as much flow to the storyline as you get.with this show.  They changed the line from them needing t be ready for the big event hitting in the 21st century to being prepared.  Interesting given they never said what it was.  Now with Captain Jack hitting everyone on the show or at least wanting to we get introduced to some of his past and the person he stole his identity from who ironically has the hots for him.

With Season 2 we at least have science fiction and some better alignment of the story and the baseline for the story.  The show is a bit more consistent and the stories tie together better.  This is the season where the show earns it the 4 star rating as while there are still many deviations, it is science fiction and should have surprises in the technology or it would lose that portion of the show that drew science fiction fans to watch in the first place.

I personally dislike the inclusion of our captain's promiscuity with the men and woman as it distracts from the story and doesn't add to the character.  It is fine to include the personal life aspects of the characters in a series, but these are purposeless tangents in the story to add sex to the show at a level that feels forced.  They are already a group of isolated ""nerds"" who just so happen to be exceptionally good looking at the same time (just like real life?), could write consistently to include these details or not but instead it is sporadic and pointless to the stories.

The show continues to be an oddball show that given its writing flaws continues to provide the entertainment so lacking in most shows and thus keeps fans interested.  Just have to be ready to have things turn on a dime at any moment in any show which is part of the interest but also part of the lack of any real pace to the show and sense that there is a progression of a story line being told.  It continues to just be radical shifts in the story and revelations that don't reconcile to anything that has been building, just more information to add to the stockpile of wherever this show is heading.

I continue to enjoy watching in spite of the lack of sense of a story being told because there is enough energy and interesting developments that it is entertaining, even if not assembled into anything that resembles an ongoing story being told.  The change in the tone and cadence is just part of makes Torchwood unique.  I'll reserve whether that is good or bad until I get to the end.  For now it is just different and taking getting used to.  I have more negative to say than positive, but it does continue to be entertaining so I keep watching and liking it even when I find it frustrating and left with a sense that it could turn into something I don't like at any time within 2 shows.  So far it hasn't though, so I watch and am still enjoying what I see for the most part.",1404000000,,2901,4.340740740740741

Torchwood's job is to keep Alien (not just outerspace aliens) and alien tech in check. The reason this show doesn't get 5 stars is because it is sexually charged. My 13 year old watches with me and he giggles though most of it because we never know what is going to happen with the personal lives of the team. It isn't pornographic like many TV-MA shows just very sexually charged. Also,a warning, we call the main character, Jack, an equal opportunity Lover.

3345301,5,B0013GS3WW,Very exciting and engaging; each character is unique and his/her inner/outer life probed in some depth. Relationships between the characters are complex and interesting.  Some of the situations and solutions are improbable and inconsistent - even by fantasy sci-fi standards - but the acting and story-lines are generally quite good.,1400112000,,333,5.66

If you like Dr Who I think you'd like this series.
I watched out of order as the first one I learned of was the mini series Torchwood Children of Earth. When I found the series it helped put everything into perspective for me. Although if you watched Dr Who you know how Jack came to be immortal.",1396828800,,527,4.12621359223301

However, if you can handle feeling those emotions and more, this is a fantastic series. The acting is incredible, the plots are interesting and the relationships between the characters are complex and intense. The reason I started watching this series was because I had seen John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness on Dr Who, and was instantly drawn in because he is eye candy of the highest degree. The reason I kept watching, however, was that the show drew me in, made me feel as if I was actually there, in the midst of the action, created real, strong emotions in me.

Now that the stage has been set, Torchwood Cardiff shows off their goods.  The varied plots and good writing allow the actors the ability to interact as though they were not only friends and working together but truly friends in all senses of the word.

I'm not an expert on acting or plot building, but it just felt very washed out/dry and I only watched it because I wanted to check out all the instant videos I get.  Sometimes I felt like they were trying to go somewhere with the characters but then whatever the idea was just got dropped/reimagined.  It got a bit interesting end of 2nd season and seasons 3 + 4 were pretty good.
I'd say if you want to get the achievement for watching everything you can without additional costs (atop amazon prime cost), you can watch it in the background while you also have other stuff to do.  The first season was even worse so you can survive this if you survived that season.

O.K., some of the plots are a bit lame, and there are elements that cannot be explained. The logic is not always sound. But, there is always the good-looking and talented cast to keep you coming back for more. The pace of the shows is good, and the ideas are creative. I don't look for a whole lot of logic in a show built around the idea of a rift in time and space centered in Cardiff (or anywhere else, for that matter).

I've enjoyed watching most of the episodes, but I would like to see a bit less of the homosexualality that's shown in this series compared to others.  That slight issue however, is enough to cause me to take away one star.  Almost as good as Doctor Who, but every episode takes place here on Earth while Doctor Who gets to travel to different worlds and different times.",1389398400,2,413,4.407894736842105

3345428,4,B0013GS3WW,I love the series just not all the language (cursing) and sex scenes.  Being a Dr Who spin off it should have stuck to the same family friendliness.,1389225600,,148,4.285714285714286

3345433,4,B0013GS3WW,"Even if the premise is a little far fetched this series kept my attention from the first episode to the last in series one. The acting is better than average and the actors are really great eye candy. For those who have a problem with Gay sex this is not for you although they are few and far between. Set in the future this is what COULD happen if disease was totally eradicated and population exploded,  Series two I switched off 30 minutes into the first episode, very violent an trashy.",1389139200,,490,4.384615384615385
3345434,5,B0013GS3WW,"What sets this series apart from many others is the writing. The plots are not developed nor concluded simply. The characters have faults that can realistically get in the way of solving problems. Also, the resolution of some of the plot lines are more realistic than The Hero Saves The Day.  Not all solutions are 100% happy endings.  However, anyone who is offended by the occasional character interaction that is adult orientated, would be better sticking to Battleship Galactica or Star Trek.",1389052800,,496,5.036585365853658

3345443,4,B0013GS3WW,Still good but lack a little from the killing off of two of the main characters in the series. But if you watch BBC you will find them on another Steven Moffat or Jeffrey Davies written show.,1388275200,,191,4.1891891891891895

3345450,5,B0013GS3WW,Love this show! Gwen and Captain Jack are the modern day Mulder and Scully. Gwen is a great but reluctant heroine. Jack is the lovable but unpredictable hero. The Torchwood Team with Owen and Tosh are very enjoyable. Seasons 1 thru 3 are the best.,1384732800,,247,4.511111111111111
3345451,5,B0013GS3WW,"I watched through all of Torchwood within a month so my perspective is a bit different from people who watched it as it aired. The season starts with the return of Captain Jack who has just survived the end of the world (again) unbeknownst to his team. We're introduced to a possible new adversary and throughout the season we learn more about the members of the Torchwood team. Maybe I simply didn't notice it in Season 1 but suddenly Ianto was funny this season, providing some of my favorite moments in the entire series. He unexpectedly becomes my favorite character. Still filled with special features, this is another wonderful box set. Season 2 is a bit better than season 1, less explicit language (not that it bothered me), plenty of twists and turns, and learning more about the characters was great. Despite knowing the fate of certain people, the end of the season was upsetting so beware of that. The end of season 2 works as a series finale much better than the end of Miracle Day which is the actual last installment. It's probably just as good of an ending as Children Of Earth provided, but maybe not as depressing.",1384473600,5,1132,4.63681592039801

Sad to remember how pithy the stories were and played brilliantly by a great ensemble. Wish Captain Jack and crew could use the rift to find their way back. Never will understand how they could ruin such a fun show by over producing and over stuffing.,1381708800,,392,4.535211267605634

3345468,4,B0013GS3WW,The next step in the story several characters history's and motivations evolve with some parts of their back story seemingly disappearing (though admittedly they could just be not talking about things that embarrass them).

My kids watch Doctor Who but this is NOT for children with some language and adult situations. This is great fun and feels like a roller coaster ride full of dips and surprise turns.. Gwen and Jack are the NEW dynamic duo - I highly recommend this series.,1379030400,,425,4.51948051948052

3345481,4,B0013GS3WW,"Season 1 is hit and miss with some highs and unfortunately quite a bit of mehs and lows. It seems like the series is trying to find its footing and that the writers are still grappling with the voice of the characters.

Season 2, on the other hand, has mostly highs. The team dynamics is natural and a good grasp of the voice of the characters, resulting in more consistent characterization. The ""revamp"" of one particular character and his developing relationship with another sealed it for me.",1378252800,,495,4.689655172413793

3345483,5,B0013GS3WW,I love it . Other may disagree but great spin off from Dr Who. Exciting scifi mix with comedy. Not boring at all,1378252800,,112,3.9130434782608696

3345485,4,B0013GS3WW,"Torchwood Series 2 was a definite improvement from Series 1 (not that Series 1 was bad).  Series 3 is even better.  It went off the rails in Series 4 (Miracle Day).  I'd love to see Torchwood come back, but in back in Cardiff not America.  It would be great if they could pretend like Miracle Day never happened.",1378166400,,312,4.327586206896552
3345486,3,B0013GS3WW,"Great price, quick shipping.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the condition in which the item was received. It was sent in a simple envelope, not padded in any way, and the cover was ripped and the case crushed. Luckily all the DVDs were still playable.

3345491,3,B0013GS3WW,"Wow this was a MASSIVELY disappointing season of Torchwood. I thought they made a lot of mistakes like trying to squeeze in Jack's Brother Gray as a villain without probably setting up his story. You never really connect with him. After you watch episode 2 ""Sleepers"", of this season which was amazing, it will leave you wondering why weren't these aliens the main villain instead of washed up James Masters and his annoying little brother Gray. Torchwood is still better than most stuff on tv, but boy this can't even compare to Season 1, 3, and 4.

Highlights;
Sleeper(One of the Best Torchwood Episodes)
Meat
Adrift(Another Gem for Torchwood, excellent character insight to Gwen and Captain Jack)

Best Character;
Captain Jack(First Season I thought Gwen Cooper was better, but now the real Jack Harkness starts to come out and we see how different from his counter part Dr. Who he really his when it comes to his own sense of morality)",1377302400,,939,4.826086956521739
3345492,3,B0013GS3WW,"Overall, I would say I enjoyed this series. I mean I finished watching it. The zombie Owen, was intriguing, but was also just a long drawn out inevitable death, sad to say he was more interesting dead than alive. But mostly, I got sick of the many Cap'n Jack deaths, ugh! Honestly, being buried alive for 100 years....ick. The fact that the character is still sane is a bit of a stretch.",1377216000,,387,4.388888888888889
3345493,4,B0013GS3WW,"As with Series 1 ... Initial interest was in it's tie in to Dr. Who. Nicely done, entertaining and fun to watch. Can't say I loved it but it was entertaining.

Seems like they were quick to throw in the same sex kissing a lot. Not directly related to the story line so seemed a bit over done.",1377216000,,292,4.0344827586206895

3345496,5,B0013GS3WW,"This episode did not have aliens, monsters, or some nemesis for Cpatain Jack to fight; it was a time travel episode with an English infantryman put into suspended animation by Torchwood in 1918 and ""defrosted"" once a year since then.  The central theme of the story is that at some unknown time he is to have a critical role in sealing a time rift that if allowed to remain open will destroy...well, everything.  There is an emotional tug for Tosh but as always, things work out in the end. A great episode.",1377043200,,507,4.5
3345497,4,B0013GS3WW,"I bought season four of this show at a garage sale and once watched we were hooked.  Watched all other seasons on Amazon Instant Video and LOVED all seasons.  The only drawback is Jack-the main character is gay and they show lots of scenes of him with other men.  That was a little weird and disquieting, but that's my bigotry showing.  Original plots and great casting.  Jack, I hate to say, was not a very good actor, but nice to look at.  The supporting cast were all excellent actors.  It's kind of like a British version of 'The X-Files'.  Check it out.  I highly recommend it.",1377043200,,582,4.415094339622642
3345498,3,B0013GS3WW,"Torchwood is a decent series that is a spin-off of Doctor Who. It has very adult themes and sexual chemistry. However, it never quite hits the mark on drawing the viewer in. Character development is lacking, except for Jack Harkness. If you want to know more about Jack then watch this series. If you're looking for a Doctor Who type show, then look elsewhere.",1376956800,,360,4.640625

Jack's hello's were usually stopped with a ""Don't start!"" from the Doctor, and Jack is a sexy man!  He likes sex and makes no secret of it... and he pretty much exudes sex.

That being said... his time with and love for the Doctor changed him.  He genuinely wants to save the world instead of stealing from it, and Gwen helps keep him to keep being that man.  As does Ianto, who we see more of his relationship with in season two.

I really don't understand why more people don't like this series.  It's got to be one of my favorites.",1372723200,,694,4.212121212121212

Instead of 007 you get capt jack harckness who is hired by the British prime minister and queen to head up an organization called Torchwood! And they control unauthorized alien visitors who some just want to party and have a good time and others want to destroy the earth.
Either way Torchwood has to deal with them and Torchwood has the highest authority in the land! Also earth is centered on a riff, so we get all alien travelers. Did I mention Torchwood was established in the 1880s
Fun,quirky,gross, and if you get though all the shows just wait!
Anerican movie channel Cinemax did a season last year!
Lots of Torchwood fun but in America!!!",1370908800,,657,4.672413793103448

Human drama, science fiction themes, every day sort of stuff and yet it's all tied together by storylines that are extremely well written. BBC knows how to pick shows I guess. Watch them all, every episode and the Specials too. You won't regret it. Mature audiences,  should think.",1368835200,,402,4.569444444444445

When season 2 came out, I didn't think it was as good as season 1, but going back and watching it again, I have to say it was brilliant!

The past of the main characters are explored including how each became a member of Torchwood,  As with season one, the stories are very adult & deal with darker themes.  The main theme of this season deals with losses- family, love & life & how past actions shape & play a major part of who a person becomes.  It is too bad that this is the last full season of the series.  Why BBC only did a mini series for the third season makes no sense to me.

Torchwoods attempt do make themselves a bit more adult than the Dr. Who stories, and wind up a little sophomoric in the attempt, most of the time. The second season develops the team more.  It is more about the Torchwood team, quirky as they are, than being just the Captain Jack Harkness Show.

The writing and acting totally carry this series way beyond what us American audiences are used to. (I do wish they would either stop killing off the principle characters, or let them stay dead when they do pass on!)

I doubt if the franchise will last as long as Dr. Who, but I think they have a few more great stories to tell.

All right, now that all the children are gone, I'll say that if you don't mind a well-written, well-acted, occassionally depressing science fiction series, then this second series of Torchwood is well worth watching.  Yes, it's intended for adults, so it's got a little gore, a little violence, and some swear words you don't normally hear on American TV.  Sex?  What sex?  You see Jack kissing a couple guys (in seperate episodes), and Tosh in bed with one man after sex and another man before (in seperate episodes).  No nudity.",1338336000,,582,4.818181818181818

The secret is that the woman you are married to is only married to you because you are safe and controllable. she has a 'true' love in her mind, but it is a man who is not controllable and who makes her give 100% to him. This is unacceptable to women and therefore they only marry someone whom they don't care about. Men don't want to know this. They don't want to know that, should she hear that you have had and accident, the first thought that goes through her mind is 'where is the insurance policy'. If she married you, you are the donkey used to carry the load. If she married you, you are only a fleeting thought in between the memories of her true love. If she married you, you don't matter; you are disposable. That gives her a feeling of control and allows her to save her emotions for the one who is truly important to her. It is dangerous for men to know this truth. both society and the species depends on men continuing to think that they are loved by their families even though that is the greatest female lie.",1337990400,,1139,4.3023255813953485
3345592,4,B0013GS3WW,"Torchwood Season 2 continues in the same vein as Season 1 - predictably unpredictable, a wild variety of story styles, with sex, death, aliens, and so on.  There are bold ideas and events that are somewhat subtle in their presentation; you have to think about what is being said to get the full impact.  It is quirky and quite different from most TV shows, and a nice change from the usual USA shows.  There are a few writers for the show, and they make no attempt to make the show seem like it has one writer, judging by the variety of styles - even from the same writer.

James Marsters makes an important appearance in the series, being part of the overarching story line for the entire season, which mainly affects the beginning and the end.  I really enjoyed him in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, as Spike.  And again as Spike in Angel, a Buffy spin-off.  In this series, his name is John, but he mostly plays it like Spike anyway, and I wondered at first if he could be anyone else.  But we see new sides to his character eventually, and in Caprica 1.0 and 1.5, he shows up yet again, looking a little older and chubbier, but much darker, and without all the smirky stuff.  As it happens, we have been watching Caprica, Torchwood 2 and the final season of Angel during the same months, and it really seemed like he was always going to be present.

In Season 1 episode 1, we are introduced to the Torchwood team, though not their background, with the exception of Gwen, who at that time is a police officer.  We learn how it is that she comes to be part of the team, and see how she changes.  Near the end of Season 2, there is an episode that does a nice job introducing three other characters, how Jack met them, and how they changed on joining the team.  Jack remains a bit of an enigma, though there are enough bits tossed out to get the general idea of his unusual background.  The storyline involving James Masters gives us more important information.

We often watch the show with English subtitles.  Part of it is the rather thick Welsh-English accent employed by some characters, part of it is to study the interesting turns of phrase in their local vernacular.

It's hard to discuss this series much more without getting into spoilers.  I'll just comment that I like it when shows are willing to portray events that force the show to change dramatically, and this one does that: it sets the scene for change in Children of Earth, a.k.a. Season 3.  I'm looking forward to it!

Why four stars?  This is a very good and entertaining show, but I reserve five stars for my all-time favorites, and there are better shows than this out there.  Four stars means ""I like it"" and from me that is a very positive review.",1329955200,2,2719,4.428571428571429

I suppose I could put my first comment in a review of Kindle Fire, but this show made me REALLY wish I had a fast forward.  From the repeated intro for every episope, even into season two, at the beginning then an actual intro a few min. in.
So many of the plot lines were so rife with holes that there seemed little work was put into writting as the cgi budget and sexual agenda were the real priorities.
Then, as the others talk mildly about, there is the graphic and less than even casual depiction of sex, for everyone, not just Jack.  Being fan of the Doctor,  I wanted to keep up with the universe.  However, you must be prepared for people with such little regard for anything that they sleep with everything, and I do mean everything.  Such little respect for real relationships does little to change stereotypes of sexual proclivities outside monogamous heterosexual couples.  I am not narrowminded enough to say everyone has even the remotest similar motivation for choosing other lifestyles, but this certainly feeds my belief that most of us humans make choices that are based on selfish, ""I feel good "" reasoning, not biological or what is best for humanity or even oneself.  For being a spin-off of a show that has made us think for so long, I wish I had an amnesia pill from Jack so I could forget Torchwood.  You may dismiss me as a prude American, and that's fine, but as I near 40,  I realize that the third of my life spent in Europe did not add to my satisfaction as a complete person as much as my beliefs.
To sum it up,  if you like cutting edge tv that makes having any sexual values seem so yesterday,  then this is the show for you.  If you define cutting edge as thin sci-fi plots chopped full of nudity and random encounters in the sack with any passersby, male female or alien,  this is for you, not me.",1328140800,7,1984,4.7492711370262395

What we get instead is a poorly sketched episode with clunky special effects more at home in low budget Bollywood horror movies, and a couple of thrusts at extending the story arc of Torchwood, which seems to be casting for direction mid-way through the second season.

A spin-off of the hugely successful Doctor Who series, Torchwood follows the adventures of Captain Jack Harkness (played by the wonderfully gifted actor John Barrowman); Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), a former constable who is recruited by Jack; Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori), Torchwood Cardiff's computer genius; Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), the Torchwood medical examiner; and Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd), Torchwood's resident guard, coffeemaker, and Captain Jack's closest friend within Torchwood.

One of the things I like most about this second season is that it does not disappoint when it comes to the action and suspense: there is plenty of that to go around!  There are more aliens and bigger explosions, but creator Russell T. Davies manages to weave in a very fascinating story around these elements as well.  As the Doctor would say, ""Brilliant!""

Yes, Jack is bisexual, so if that disturbs you, then Torchwood is probably not the best viewing choice. The handling of sexuality in the series is matter-of-fact, and certainly a lot less graphic than, say, True Blood. Given some of the language and the dark tone of the stories, I wouldn't recommend this show to very young viewers; they would enjoy Dr. Who more anyway.

3345609,5,B0013GS3WW,"I've only been a fan of ""Doctor Who"" for a couple of years, but I became hooked almost immediately.  When I learned that it had generated two spin-off series, I was interested.  ""Torchwood"" centers around Captain Jack Harkness, one of the Doctor's fromer companions, and his team at the Torchwood Institute, introduced during Sesaon Two of ""Doctor Who.""  They are charged with defending the Earth in the Doctor's absence.  This series has a darker tone than ""Doctor Who,"" but it's still very thrilling.",1289865600,,502,5.0120481927710845
3345610,4,B0013GS3WW,"In my review for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-season-of-Torchwood/dp/B000VWE5OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first season of Torchwood</a>&nbsp;I concluded that the show had plenty of potential in regards to its setup, actors and production values, but which was obviously struggling to find its feet. A reliance on shock value, some sloppy scripts, and the inclusion of several unlikable main characters weakened the final product, though not so much that I wasn't intrigued by the possibility of these mistakes being rectified in the following season.

And for the most part, they are. Season two is aware of its past faults and makes an effort to fix them. The stories are less predictable and manage to be more fun and more serious at the same time. Characters are better developed, and the annoying qualities of Gwen and Owen have been toned down (though not eradicated). And rather than relying on singular episodes there is more of an overarching plot at work that allows for more depth in the storytelling.

A spin-off of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B000E41MS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>&nbsp;that purports to be more ""adult"", Torchwood is the name of a not-so-secret organization that deals with the aliens, time-travelers and other anomalies that emerge through the Rift in space and time that it situated right over the city of Cardiff, Wales. The team is lead by the charming, enigmatic and impossible-to-kill Captain Jack Harkness, and made up of policewoman Gwen Cooper, computer-technician Toshiko Sato, medical doctor Owen Harper and faithful butler Ianto Jones. Making a pseudo-family of sorts, the colleges deal with the strange occurrences that threaten the city and its inhabitants.

And of strange occurrences there are many, including a familiar face from Jack's past out to cause trouble, alien sleepers planning an invasion, a cryogenically frozen soldier from the first world war, an alien that can seamlessly integrate himself into memories, a stranded alien whale, shape-shifters, creepy side-show performers that emerge from old film reels, and a range of civilian disappearances.  For the most part the stories are well written and convincingly acted, and although some are certainly better than others, none of them are unwatchable.

But it's the human element that makes the second season an improvement on its predecessor. Every character is given more depth and background, and the actors seem a lot more settled in their roles. Gwen is far more useful and her much-vaunted empathy is actually shown rather than just harped on. Owen is still abrasive and arrogant, but at least his repugnant qualities have been significantly lessoned. The writers choose to deal with Owen and Gwen's affair by completely ignoring it (a little strange, but neither characters' finest moment, and so probably for the best). Tosh and Ianto are given more screen-time, and stories of their own.

Most of all, we learn more about the mysterious Captain Jack, first introduced in Doctor Who as a con-artist from the 51st century. There are plenty of insights into his life, including his childhood in the distant future, the loss of his little brother Grey, his time-traveling back into the Victorian era and his initial recruitment into Torchwood at the hands of some rather sassy 19th century ladies. The more we know, the more intriguing he becomes. In an extended flashback episode, we also learn how the three original members of Jack's team were brought together as a team, whether it was frightening, tragic or humorous. Midway through the series, one of the team-members goes through a (literally) life-changing experience, which changes our entire preconceptions of this character and how he operates within the group - and in fact, life itself.

There's also a plethora of guest stars that add color and interest to the usual routine. Fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer/dp/B000AQ68RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>&nbsp;will instantly recognize James Marsters as Captain John Hart, a fellow time agent and a foil to our Jack, whose true feelings and motivations are left slightly murky throughout his appearances. Martha Jones from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B000UVV2GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>&nbsp;stops by, significantly more grown-up and professional as a UNIT member and qualified doctor who lends her services to the team for a three-episode arc. And I have a soft-spot for Rhys, Gwen's befuddled fianc who finally finds out the truth about his partner's job and reacts in quite a touching way. In many ways Rhys exemplifies the ""everyman"" far more than Gwen does, and when he steps up to the plate (with a chainsaw, no less), it's worth a round of applause.

Altogether, I definitely enjoyed this season more than the last, though it continues to irritate me that the Torchwood team always seems to come across as a group of very smart people doing very stupid things. Despite Jack's opening narrative: ""Torchwood is ready,"" nothing could be further from the truth. This is not a team of professionals, but a few individuals recruited as much for their dysfunctional natures as their skills. Whether this makes them all the more endearing or just plain irritating usually depends on the context of the story they're in and the quality of the episode. As always, the DVD is packed full of supplementary material, including outtakes, deleted scenes, a featurette on Jack, and an in-depth look at all the episodes.

3345618,4,B0013GS3WW,"""Torchwood"" is a British science fiction series and a spin off to the unnaturally popular ""Doctor Who"". Indeed, the name Torchwood is actually an anagram of Doctor Who.

""Doctor Who"" is a very quaint series, often bordering the intentionally ridiculous, and although styled as a family show, it's probably best suited for kids around 13 years of age. The main character, the Doctor, is a immortal, shape shifting space alien who battles evil robots and mad scientists, while roaming the universe in a time machine disguised as a phone boot (!).

""Torchwood"", by contrast, was marketed as a more adult series. It does contain more sex, violence and general mayhem, and the characters all seem to suffer from constant neuroses. To all intents and purposes, however, it's really a kind of ""Doctor Who for adults"". The evil aliens may be more violent, but they are just as comical (or involuntarily comical) as the aliens in ""Doctor Who"". Don't miss the fat lady dressed in green who turns out to be a monster with strange breeding habits. Or the monster insects from outer space who can cure AIDS. Or the Weevils, a bunch of bizarre aliens who for reasons unknown live in the...wait for it...sewers of Cardiff. Why not move to a public housing estate?

The human characters, with their strange depressions, also come across as a bunch of funny weirdos. I mean, one of them runs around half of season two in mint zombie condition. The leader of the Torchwood team, Captain Jack, is an immortal bisexual. His gay boyfriend has the usual penchant for fashionwear. And then there's Tosh, a Japanese computer geek madly and sadly in love with the zombie.

Well, at least they have diversity on this show!

The first time a saw ""Torchwood"", I considered it really bad. I guess I didn't see the comic potential. If you take this show with a large grain of salt, you may actually enjoy some of the episodes.

Then, you don't have to torch Torchwood.

If you don't know, BBC-A severely edited the episodes, both to make them ""fit the timeslot"" and for content.  I was *NOT* impressed that Amazon didn't state that the set was the edited versions.  But it turns out they're not!  Despite what the cover says, these are the full, original, unedited versions of the Torchwood Series 2 episodes.  Season 2 starts with the team (minus Jack, still MIA)chasing some crazy looking fish-headed alien through the streets of Cardiff and doesn't ever slow down.

And why on Earth does BBC have to put the theme song and clip of the cast walking along in front of every episode?  Very annoying.  If there is a third season I will not buy it.",1263168000,16,498,4.384615384615385
3345623,3,B0013GS3WW,"The first season was brilliant with clever plots, good acting and really interesting characters. The problems lies with the unfortunate ubiquitous ""humanizing"" of heroes - a common problem for all SF/fantasy/horros TV series. The writers start introducing more emotions, more love lines, more siblings problems and suffering and move from ""the city and the monsters"" show (which is interesting) into the ""sex, city and a bit of monsters - when we have time for them"". The overly rich emotional life of the heroes just bores to death. As much as I loved the first season, I am not sure even if I want to watch the ""children of earth"" - if it continues in the same direction. If anyone knows a good urban SF show that does not slide into the countless close ups of faces ""ravaged by tears of grief"", please give a hint. What happened to the authors sense of humor?",1263081600,,862,4.640522875816994
3345624,4,B0013GS3WW,"When one takes into account what Russell T. Davies has done with his iteration of the Whoniverse, it becomes apparent that he has created--to this point--a triangle between ""Doctor Who"", ""The Sarah Jane Adventures"", and ""Torchwood"" with The Doctor being the apex/midpoint between the other two.  ""Sarah Jane""--because its home is BBC Kids--seems a little more buoyant, obviously aiming for its younger audience.  ""Torchwood"" is the punch in the mouth--it isn't pretty, it isn't nice, and sometimes the good guys don't get total victories.
  This is part of the theme of Series 2--and if one gets antsy with ""unclean wins"", so be it.  As I said about Series 1, Torchwood is a dark, somewhat cracked reflection of Doctor Who.  It isn't hard to see John Barrowman's Jack Harkness as what The Doctor would be if all his flaws were brought to the fore and his desires laid public.  Nor is it hard to not see that Eve Myles' Gwen Cooper as a Companion with a few more skills...and complications to her life and to Captain Jack's.  The ways that Burn Gorman, Nakano Mori and Gareth Lloyd-Davies fill out the team compliment the lead taken by Barrowman and Myles, as well as the flaws they exhibit.  Barrowman has a pulse on the nature of Jack--who is far more of a serious sort than when he was introduced--and Myles brings a wonderful energy and depth to Gwen, attempting to balance her life with Torchwood Three with her impending nuptials with Rhys Williams; to say nothing of what happens when Rhys (Wonderfully played with the element of Archie Bunker as a jealous lover by Kai Owen) finds out what Gwen has been doing with her nights.
  Still, this season is a complicated story, and the story starts when James Marsters shows up in the opening episode, ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"".  There seems to be an unspoken rule with science fiction on both sides of the Atlantic--if you need a slightly over-the-top, trash-talking gray area character then find The Artist Formerly Known as Spike.  Marsters wonderfully embodies Captain John Hart, Jack's former partner (and lover) in the Time Agency; and his appearance sets in motion much of the twists and turns of the season.  So does Freema Agyeman's three-episode visit in the middle of this set as Martha Jones, during which the first severe turn occurs within Torchwood Three with Owen Harper's murder and regeneration, how the team adjusts to an already grumpy medical specialist who suddenly cannot enjoy eating, sleeping, or boinking.  I always felt that they never gave enough time in the series to Mori, who brought a considerable warmth and longing to Toshiko Sato, ultimately not fulfilled.  Her turn in ""To The Last Man"" was a wonderful and sad performance, and really came to embody the heartache in Tosh's life.  There is really not much done with Ianto through the second series--save the explanation of how he came to Torchwood Three in ""Fragments""--but it seems as if much of who he is is saved for ""Children Of Earth""...and the one scene with Barrowman and Myles that left me more than a little squeamish...
  Still, through the drama and pain--""To The Last Man"" and ""Adam"" embody much of the angst that goes unspoken between the members--to the action and slightly humorous moments of ""Something Borrowed""...the sense of something going horribly wrong is there, and gets fulfilled in ""Fragments"" and ""Exit Wounds"".  These two episodes, combined with the ""Children Of Earth"" miniseries, led many to suspect that Torchwood wouldn't be returning in 2010 when Series 5 of Doctor Who started...but that doesn't seem to be the case.
  This set is a tough, hard series of episodes; a crime drama that is more visceral and gritty than the series it was born from.  It's supposed to be that way.  It can be a little over-the-top--but so, very much so, is the series that it was drawn from.  And taken as what it is--the dark side of The Doctor's Universe--it fits the bill.  I consider this set to be highly enjoyable, and I recommend it because Torchwood--as an anthology--is a very good work in progress, with room to get better.",1261526400,2,4079,4.833093525179856
3345625,2,B0013GS3WW,"I bought seasons 1 & 2 of the show because I like Dr. Who. But I was up for a disappointment. The episodes' stories, in and of themselves, are very poor. Furthermore, the basic idea of the show: the superagency protecting us from the dangers of the Universe, is faltering at every step. The team members are often reduced to simple registrars of unfolding events over which they have little or no control. The agents are incompetent and easy to break their professional duty.

On top of it, as if it is not bad enough, the show becomes a kind of ""a relationship movie"", creating a strong flavor of a soap opera. Everyone sleeps with everyone else, regardless of sex, and, at later times, some parties are upset about that. As the show progresses, the scenes become more explicit, with strong emphasis on homosexuality. This is quite unexpected and rhyme poorly with the overall context of the show. Most certainly, a lot of ""mature"" content cannot make up for boring storylines of Torchwood.",1259798400,10,991,4.728323699421965

3345642,4,B0013GS3WW,"Season Two if far different than season one.  you know that right away, from the opening narration, which has been coldly changed from the first year.  Did some people object I wonder?  It used to be,  ""Torchwood.  Outside the government, beyond the police. Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future. The 21st century is when everything changes. And you got to be ready.""

This season Russell Davies and Co have gotten rid of the arming humans part.  A gesture towards pacifism?  ""Torchwood.  Outside the government, beyond the police. Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race. The 21st century is when everything changes. And Torchwood is ready.""  See, they've even changed the last few words.  When before it was ""You've got to be ready,"" now we find out that we needn't bother taking arms against the alien invaders, since Torchwood has it covered.

And yet, as other reviewers have noticed, Torchwood ain't ready for nothin!  If I was a drinking man, I would play my own game, every time Captain Jack's eyes well up with close-up tears, I'd have a shot of some Welsh liquor, and I'd still be drunk.  Everyone's emotional, which is cool I guess, but sometimes it all gets a bit much, especially given that all five leads are grieving for a love that's lost to them now by death or other malfeasance, so their energies seem often lost in the past, like the heroes of Marcel Proust, so that aliens slip by them like nuns past the blind man.  In this season Gwen and Rhys finally get married, and even better Rhys is let into the secrets of Torchwood, and that is fortunate, sicne the Famous 5 start to get out of their self-absorbed melancholia and start seeing things as Rhys sees them--how preposterous they are.

In a way, I liked the shock ending, but in another way, it makes me feel like the next season probably won't be that good.

3345643,1,B0013GS3WW,"I loved ""Who"" and have watched both spin-offs; this and Sarah Jane Adventures.

At first Torchwood was original, intriguing with a good group of actors. That would be this Season. But don't let yourself get hooked! Season two takes a horrible turn for the worse.

In season 2 it seams the writers are trying to make sure every character ""bats for both teams"" and everyone sleeps with just about everyone.

I'm not a homo-phobe: there are questions about my dad who still rooms with the same guy he left my mom for. My husband has a cousin everyone wishes would come out. It is part of our world today.

But this show makes it seem like it is natural for everyone to change their minds. Take the butler like guy. In the first season he is pining over his girlfriend that he's hidden in the basement. She's half robot.

Season II:

He and the Captain become lovers.

It was my understanding that either you are or you aren't. You don't just wake up one day and decide to swap teams.

Add to this that the main character, the girl - I'm really bad with names - who is shacking up with her boyfriend. She decides to have a romance with one of the guys in Torchwood. It seems every other episode is about who's doing who.

Although on the other hand having Jack and Gwen solving mysteries on their own like Doctor Who would be a very copycat thing to do.

John Barrowman who plays Captain Jack is magnetic.  Talk about charisma!  No wonder the others follow him even though they know very little about him.  For me Torchwood first and second seasons have been about knowing more about Captain Jack.
Dr. Who has never interested me that much.  Sometimes I watch some of the new Dr. Who on PBS.  I can take Dr. Who or leave it though the new Dr. Who is an interesting character too.
I am mesmerized by Captain Jack though.  He is the man all men want to be with -- straight or gay.

3345667,5,B0013GS3WW,"I'm a science fiction fan -- been afflicted since I read my first Robert Heinlein book at the age of 8 (and that's a scary number of years ago).  When BBC-America began running Torchwood about 2 years ago, I was hooked after the first episode.

Of course, it didn't hurt that I was already familiar with the central character, Capt. Jack Harkness, from his appearances on Dr. Who, another BBC series that had wormed its way into my heart.  And it didn't hurt that John Barrowman, scores a 9-1/2 on the handsome scale, or that his character is able to hold his sense of humor in the fact of death and destruction.  However, the most important part of the first episode is that all of the characters were fully formed and ready to interact with themselves and their world.

The characters are fascinating; Gwen is the heart of the cast, an ex?-police officer with a sensitivity to both humans and monsters that they meat, whereas Owen, the doctor, is the opposite rude, callous, and unable to form a lasting relationship with anyone.  Toshiko (""Tosh"") is a shy genius with an amazing touch with computers, hacking in wherever she needs to find what she needs.  Finally, there's Ianto, with, as Jack once says, his ""beautiful Welsh vowels,"" another shy man who started off as the ""receptionist"" and liaison with the outside world.  Finally, there's Cardiff, a city with a personality like no one has ever seen before -- Strongly Welsh with a modern overlay.

Watch a couple episodes.  You'll find yourself as intrigued as I have become, and, no matter what your sexual orientation, probably in love with one or more of the characters, as well as the city and the delightful, scary, sad, funny, and brilliant monsters that you'll come across in each episode.",1223769600,4,1754,4.740131578947368

3345672,4,B0013GS3WW,"It's yet another season of ""Torchwood"", a ""Doctor Who"" for adults.  Now in its 2nd season, we meet a team of professionals who battle aliens and try to protect us from all sorts of cosmic anomalies.  Based in Cardiff - centrally located on a rift in time and space - ""Torchwood"" stands ready to do the job.  With plenty of foul language and sexual...um...stuff, you never forget the seriousness of the situation, or the fact that the end of the world never means having to forego a good ""snog"".

""Torchwood"" remains a pretty controversial show.  Everything that made the 1st season both fun and frustrating are ramped up in S2.

But first, the ep.s themselves.
""Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang""  (I wonder how many British shows have come and gone wishing to use that title.)  Remember how S1 built up the anticipation to that same sex kiss in ""Captain Jack Harkness""?  Well, subtlety goes out the window in the first few minutes of the season opener, returning Jack from his adventure in the ""Doctor Who"" season 2 finale.  Here, Jack introduces the team to his thrill-kill former colleague and not-so-former lover, Time-Agent Captain Jon Hart.  What is Hart's agenda?  And how much lip-lock will the team be forced to watch before Jack takes any action?

""Sleeper"", an obvious idea nevertheless not given the treatment until now.  The team must confront deep-cover terrorist insurgents from another planet.  They look like ordinary people - husbands, wives, lovers, parents - but when the signal starts, they become indestructible agents of mass destruction.

""To the Last Man"", a pretty good episode in which the team finds a breakdown in time barriers between the present and WWI era threaten the space-time continuum.  Only an inhabitant of that period, sent back to his time from our own, can save the universe.  Luckily, Torchwood has kept a WWI soldier on ice since 1918 for just such an occasion.  TV shows (especially cop shows) are typically weak because they marginalize guest stars, but this ep. shows how Torchwood excels in integrating guest characters into its larger mythos.

""Meat"".  An episode that gives the vegans a chance (among many) to laugh at us carnivores.  The team investigates a meatpacking operation profiting on the flesh of apparently alien source.  The story itself is pretty thin, but as with many eps. the saving grace is the character interaction - chiefly involving Rhys, Gwen's annoying fiance.

""Adam"".  Who's Adam?  Nobody seems to think that Adam has been anything but a longtime and loyal teammate, so nobody seems to realize that he just insinuated himself into the group and their memories.  At first helpful, the script reveals how darkly dangerous a man with memory-altering powers can be.  A great episode that reveals more background on Capt. Jack and also informs how much they care about each other.

""Reset"" what would sci-fi be without a dig at the medical establishment?  This was actually a weak story punctuated by a great appearance from Alan Dale (known in the US for ""Lost"" and ""Ugly Betty""), the debut in Torchwood of ""Doctor Who"" vet Martha Jones (which provides for much cheerily licentious dialog) and a thoroughly heartbreaking ending.

""Dead Man Walking"" picks up where ""Reset"" left off.  The facts of the story substantially nullifies the tragedy that ended ""Reset"" without damaging the other episode's dramatic payoff.  (Can't say anything else w/o a substantial spoiler.)  The episode is the midway to the conclusive ""A Day in the Death"".  Again, spoilfree review guidelines prevent more specific description.  Suffice it to say that this ep. is ""Random Shoes"" of the season, only better than that ep.

""Something Borrowed"" has Gwen and Rhys finally tying the knot.  Only, a late night duel-to-the-death with a shape-shifting alien carnivore leaves Gwen in a compromising position that threatens to ruin the wedding.  Funny, scary and still very adult, this is easily one of the show's more entertaining eps.

""From Out of the Rain"" has Cardiff menaced by ""Night Travelers"", performers of a ghostly circus that steals the breath of ordinary human beings.  A decidedly creepy ep. with a disappointing payoff.

""Adrift"" a horrible story.  Gwen follows up on a large volume of missing-person cases possibly tied to The Rift.  In bonding to many civilians in search of missing loved ones, Gwen's makes some pretty obvious and painful errors in judgment.  Anybody who thought last season's episodes ""Small Worlds"" and ""Out of Time"" were pointless will probably feel the same way about ""Adrift"".

""Fragments"" a great episode in which a crisis situation forces each of our heroes to separately delve into their past and recall how they joined Torchwood.  Best part of the episode: Jack meets Torchwood's saucy Victorian era operatives.  This ep. sets the stage for the season finale -""Exit Wounds"".  It's very difficult to discuss the finale w/o spoilers.  Let's just say that it involves Captain Jon and Jack's lost brother, Gray, and basically ends with final heartbreak for the team.  Unfortunately, it also follows too closely the 3rd season finale of Doctor Who, with the emotional confrontation between hero and villain.

WHAT'S WRONG W/TORCHWOOD?
Torchwood never fully becomes the adult version of Doctor Who.  Too many ideas are developed without a payoff (the ""Night Travellers"" being an obvious example; the show eerily introduces them, then quickly discards them); also, the show falls into the trap of so quickly assuming its maturity based on sexual content & bad language, that it sometimes leaves fatally obvious signs of its lineage to ""that other show"", itself originally a kid's show.  It takes more than a profusion of potty language and a healthy diet of ""snogging"", to elevate ""Torchwood"" to maturity - think of kids playing ""dress-up"" and you get the idea.  The other flaw is in the premise, but it's a somewhat complicated flaw.  Watching the show, it's hard to get past the idea that ""Torchwood"" is often more in need of help than capable of providing.  Their position often makes them vulnerable to otherworldly threats - despite Captain Jack's weekly refrain, ""Torchwood"" is NOT ready.

WHAT IS IRRESISTIBLE
But that premise actually the show's saving grace - the vulnerability of Jack, Ianto, Owen, Tosh and (especially) Gwen is the biggest reason for the show's appeal.  The script works in well just how close these guys get to getting offed on a weekly basis, trading witty and well-timed banter even as half the cosmos wants them dead.

I did not come to it via Dr Who (which I've never really liked all that much except as some campy fun in small does... sorry Dr Who fans).  Season 1 of Torchwood was great, if uneven in places, although the various character story arcs meant that even in the sub-par episodes there was still good meat for the character development of the team.

In season two, the main stories and the character development became much more cohesive and exciting.  Like all good sci-fi shows, Torchwood made us care about the characters while all the supernatural weirdness was happening around them.  Everyone got their own story trajectory that developed nicely over the season.  This was useful because by the time you get to the last episode, you will have a strong emotional response to how the series ends (sorry, no spoilers... but bring kleenex).

I would recommend watching the first season first, however, as the longstanding story arcs are best understood as developed from season 1.

Season 2 hangs together very well, and some of the episodes are incredibly exciting and touching.  It is really fun sci-fi, with some very interesting innovative takes on the whole 'secret society fighting aliens' genre.

8250915,3,B0013GS3WW,"Only recently did I return to Doctor Who viewing, backing up to 2009 because Amazon Prime has it. I was pleased with modern Doctor Who. Sarah Jane Adventures which was also a companion was great because it had a pleasant tone that seemed to work well as a stand alone or companion series. Then I moved on to Torchwood and was disappointed.

To be fair, Torchwood is a functional show and expectant cast. The show is quite adequate. It just does not live up to the other series it is meant to co-exist around. I keep watching because it slightly fun but not as engaging.",1507680000,,569,4.419047619047619
