879557,5,6304458975,"Roger Ebert gave it 3 1/2 Stars Out of 4 in 1997.  Eastwood stars as Luther Whitney, a burglar who breaks into a mansion in the dead of night and penetrates a hidden room filled with diamonds and cash. He's interrupted in the middle of his work by visitors. Hiding behind a two-way mirror, he sees a man and woman having sex. The play turns rough, the man beats her, the woman stabs him, and two men burst in and shoot her dead.
 Clint Eastwood  as Luther Whitney,  Gene Hackman as President Richmond,  Ed Harris as Seth Frank,  Laura Linney as Kate Whitney,
 Scott Glenn as Bill Burton,  Dennis Haysbert as Tim Collin,  E.G. Marshall  as Walter Sullivan, Richard Jenkins as Michael McCarty, AN ALL STAR CAST.  Judy Davis as Gloria Russel,  the ONLY DUD in the Cast.

879562,1,6304458975,"The plot the logic the whole scenario is
Ridiculous unbelievable and insufferable!
Contradictive logic and stupid unimaginative script.  This is a weak
Concept in spite of its potential! Not
One iota of common sense was input
Into this! One horrible example is when
Eastwoods daughter who is an attorney sets him up and in doing so he is attempted to be assassinated by the police and lol lol lol his brain dead daughter overlooks the fact and dates the detective that tried to hit her dad lol
I mean this director is s complete idiot
The fraud of intellect is insurmountable
Enormous laughable and its impossible
To actually engage the plot whatsoever",1517011200,,652,4.821428571428571

I've never heard of it so that night later on i want on Amazon and checked it out, i told him a couple days later at school that i found the dvd he wanted and it would cost him $15 new. I had to make a little profits from it for going out of my way and buying the exact dvd version of the film he wanted that was longer then the VHS copy. Those were the days and i decided to get jt for myself to see what this movie was about and what he was talk about....in my personal oppion it wasn't a bad movie, i liked some of the scenes but as for the parts that would strength and seem like a long time i got bord of it quick quite a few times or more.

It's interesting that Gene Hackman plays a very similar role in No Way Out. One of my all time favorite movies. It's also interesting that Clint Eastwood carries his own personality and same idiosyncrasies in every film he's in. I still am reminded of his role in Play Misty For Me.

880489,5,6304458975,"Had just started the audiobook version and was entertained by Mr. Baldacci's introduction to it, especially his criticisms by ""fans"".  They said <paraphrasing>, ""liked the book but it's implausible in this day and age"".  A couple years later after the Monica Lewinsky scandal they chastised him, ""you shouldn't take advantage of a scandal like that"".  How funny!

At any rate, Mr Eastwood would have to trip and fall to make a bad movie and this one's a dandy.  It had me from start to finish.  Clint is always good IMO and Ed Harris is too.  One of the great actors of our day, Gene Hackman, portrays the president and despite his far too limited acclaim as an actor he turns in a perfect performance.  Was surprised to see only one Academy nomination as, IMO Hackman deserved one... but I always think that about his roles.

Movie barely broke even, hard to believe.  Guess you just have to animate actors and blow stuff up in our attention span challenged audience these days.",1469750400,,979,4.6725146198830405

881592,5,6304458975,"Clint Eastwood & Gene Hackman have been to of my actors since ""UNFORGIVEN"". Both very strong characters in both movies.
Movie reviews I have said are very personal to me. Everyone has different tastes,  especially movies.
Hackman is president of united states, Eastwood is a very experienced thief. Eastwood finds himself in an awkward position, a bedroom closet where he sees Hackman & his female companion through a one way mirror. Things get physical between Hackman and his female. Hackman kills the female, secret service does a not so great job covering it up. Eastwood gets away, then must figure out just what to do if anything at all.
Action, Drama & yeah suspense is a given. A very good drama,""definitely a pause it to get a snack, drink or potty break kind of movie"".
Some film lovers dig these types of movies, others don't. I like any movie that has drama, suspense & the occasional ""what "" no way "" ""oh s**t"" while watching it.

881675,3,6304458975,"You've heard it said many times:  ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely"" (actually said by historian Lord Acton, 18341902, as ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely"").  Whatever, that's the premise of this 1997 adaptation of David Baldacci's best-selling thriller.  Producer, director, and star Clint Eastwood makes what he can of a nifty, though implausible, what-if idea, creating a mystery and a frustration for the viewer.  No, not all of it works.  Still, enough of it goes sufficiently well to pass a reasonably diverting two hours.

So, what if an aging jewel thief during the course of a robbery accidentally witnessed the attempted rape and the killing of a young woman in a house he was burglarizing?  Moreover, what if the man he witnessed commit the attempted rape turned out to be a drunken President of the United States and the people who did the killing were the President's secret service bodyguards!  (OK, I told you this was going to be implausible.)  Would the thief already be so morally and ethically compromised that he would neither care nor say anything about the incident?  Or if he did feel compelled to do something, what would it be?  Would authorities take the word of a known thief over that of the President?  Could a lone man do anything against the weight and authority of the most-powerful man in the country even he wanted to do something?  It's a tricky business, and if you can buy into all of the story line's silly hyperbole, the movie turns into a tension-filled cat-and-mouse story.

Eastwood plays the thief, Luther Whitney, in a performance more casual and laid-back than we usually see even from this taciturn actor.  Whitney is a master criminal who did time thirty years earlier and has been free ever since.  Imagine his surprise when after breaking into a rich man's house, he finds himself looking through a one-way glass mirror at events unfolding wholly unanticipated by him.  But Whitney's cool prevails, and he flees the scene, albeit not unnoticed.  The President's secret service agents recognize that someone else was there, watching things, and the President and his chief of staff determine not only to cover up the killing but to find the unknown observer and eliminate him.

It's not just the President's agents who are after Whitney, though; so is an assassin hired by the man whose wife the agents killed.  You'd think Whitney would skip the country at this point, since no one knows exactly who he is, but, no, this is Eastwood and this is a thriller.  He sticks around partly because of his pride but mostly because of his daughter.  When the secret service determine that Whitney was present at the scene of the crime but can't get to him directly, they decide to draw him out by going after his daughter.  You can mess with Eastwood in a movie, but you don't mess with his daughter.

The plot unfolds slowly yet with a steady forward momentum.  Eastwood generates a fairly high degree of suspense starting with Whitney's first heist, some ominous music helping considerably.  (The rest of the score, composed by Lennie Niehaus, sounds typically understated and jazz-inflected, as we have come to expect from an Eastwood film.)  In addition, a load of first-rate stars in the supporting cast doesn't hurt, either.

Gene Hackman plays the President, Allen Richard, as a squirrelly, smirking, smarmy snake in the grass.  Judy Davis plays his Harpy Chief of Staff, Gloria Russell, a cartoonish character even more unscrupulous and conniving than the President.  They agree to hush up the incident and liquidate the unknown observer when they find him.  Their accomplices are the President's two personal secret service bodyguards, played by Scott Glenn (as a good man gone bad) and Dennis Haysbert (""You're in good hands"").  Ed Harris plays Lt. Seth Frank, the officer investigating the case and the man who first senses that Whitney might have had something to do with at least the burglary end of it.  Laura Linney plays Kate Whitney, Luther's estranged daughter, a prosecuting attorney who wants nothing to do with her criminal dad.  E.G. Marshall plays Walter Sullivan, the victim's husband, an old billionaire who helped put the President in office, who determines to find out who killed his wife, and who engages an assassin to murder culprit.  Finally, Richard Jenkins in an undernourished role plays the hired assassin in deadly, calculated fashion.

That's quite a cast, even if not all of them have much to do.  And since I've always thought Ed Harris and Scott Glenn were the same actor, it's nice to see them in the same film together again.

Understand, ""Absolute Power"" is not really an action flick.  It's not even much of a thriller.  It's more of a character study above all, with the Eastwood-Linney, father-daughter relationship at its heart.  Unfortunately, things get undone in the film with too many coincidences and too pat an ending.  It almost seems as though the script should have gone on another half an hour, but the filmmakers needed to end the movie, so they did.  Abruptly.

Too bad, because parts of the story play pretty well, with more than enough tension in any number of scenes.  It's just hard to suspend one's disbelief long enough to accept much of it.  It's passable, but barely.

Video:
The Warner video engineers do a pretty good job transferring the film to Blu-ray disc, using a dual-layer BD50 and a VC-1 codec to ensure that at least most of the movie shows up the way it should in its original 2.40:1 aspect ratio.

Colors are quite rich, with beautiful greens and reds, especially, and deep black levels to set them off.  However, the colors are often quite dark, too, and perhaps too intense for ultimate realism.  Definition is fine, with our being able to see every line and wrinkle in Eastwood's, Glenn's, and Hackman's faces.  The picture shows up brightly enough, even though some indoor shots get a tad murky, and a bit of natural film grain gives the whole image a well-textured quality.

Audio:
The lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack is very subtle and subdued, with little that stands out that isn't there for a constructive purpose.  You'll hear a wide front-channel stereo spread, a solid bass, a well-balanced midrange, and suitable dynamics.  You won't hear a lot of activity in the surrounds, however, but what there is--traffic and crowd noises, wind, leaves, musical bloom--imparts an appropriate atmosphere to the story.

Extras:
For reasons I cannot fathom, Warners provide no significant extras on the disc, not even a theatrical trailer.  It couldn't have been for lack of space, their using a dual-layer, fifty-gig disc.  It's possible they couldn't find anything to include (their previous DVD release at least had a few production notes), or maybe they just didn't think it was worth the trouble; I don't know.  All we get are thirty-four scene selections; English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian spoken languages; French, German, Italian, Spanish, Danish, Norwegian, Portuguese, and other subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
Because of the number of fluke chances and contrived plot devices in the story, ""Absolute Power"" isn't quite the riveting thriller it might have been.  But that's probably more the fault of the usually reliable screenwriter, William Goldman (""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" ""All the President's Men,"" ""Marathon Man,"" ""Heat,"" ""The Princess Bride,"" ""Misery,"" ""Chaplin""), and the novel he had to adapt.  Although Eastwood does his best, as director and star, to liven things up, it's a little too much to do even for his accomplished hand.  Still, the movie's got enough twists and turns going for it, and enough humor and suspense, to keep one occupied.  Basically, it's a so-so effort from Eastwood on all fronts.",1432857600,,7859,4.988479262672811

881769,4,6304458975,"Absolute Power is a political thriller produced, directed by, and starring Clint Eastwood as a thief who witnesses a murder. The film also stars Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Judy Davis, Laura Linney, Dennis Haysbert and Scott Glenn. It was also the last screen appearance of E.G. Marshall. The screenplay by William Goldman is based on the 1996 novel of the same name written by David Baldacci.

In this thriller, an aging cat burglar becomes a crusader embroiled in a deadly cat-and-mouse game involving murder and a government cover-up. The trouble begins when ex-con Luther Whitney decides to pull off one last heist before retiring. Just as he finishes looting the vault of a well-fortified mansion, a drunken couple enters the adjoining bedroom apparently eager to start making love. But something goes awry and a violent tussle ensues that abruptly ends when gun-wielding men bust in and shoot down the woman. During the ensuing chaos, Luther slips out. Only later does the audience learn that the would-be lovers were U.S.- President Alan Richmond and Christy Sullivan, the young wife of the President's biggest supporter Walter Sullivan. As the investigation and cover-up begins, Luther, who has already been contacted by hard-boiled and suspicious detective Seth Frank begins to fear that he will be blamed for the killing and prepares to leave the country. He tries to see his daughter Kate to make peace with her for having been absent in prison during most of her life, but she rejects him. Luther goes to the airport, but just before he flies, he sees a press conference in which President Richmond, without so much as a twitch, goes on a tirade concerning his stand against violence. Something inside him snaps and he abruptly decides to stay and fight for justice.

Adapted from a novel by David Baldacci and featuring a powerful all-star cast, the story works at different levels, not only as a straight- forward thriller but also as an insightful look at the love between the old thief and his estranged daughter, a highly successful prosecuting attorney. It had an immense potential to be a classic consider the talent of the cast involved in the movie. Unfortunately,the movie ended rather abruptly as it minimized the film to a thriller that lacks suspense and tension. Aside from that,there was a seemingly lack of effort in making a good film. What saves the film is the talent of the cast and the great potential the material had despite of its poor ending and contrived and formulaic events as the movie ends.",1428710400,,2529,4.934272300469484

He plays a jewel thief who, in the act of the crime, catches the President, played by Gene Hackman having sex and roughing up the woman in her bedroom. His security detail rushes into the room as she rights him off and shoot her dead after she stabs him with a letter opener. Eastwood's character retrieves it and just gets away as the Secret Service agents give chase. The movie then becomes a roller coaster ride as he now must fight for his life. His daughter is involved in the mess and is nearly killed by a rouge agent and the hunted now becomes the hunter as he get revenge on the rouge agents and finally brings down the president in the end.

Without spoiling anything for someone else viewing it, I can say that the film, of itself, is a very good version of the original story, considering the limited time elements the screen requires.  Reading a Baldacci novel is the perfect experience, however, because of the expanded descriptions one can imagine.  As with many film versions of novels, sometimes the basic plot is destroyed.  This wasn't the case for the story's main plot; but a few of the subplot scenes in the film were so condensed that the viewer could easily be confused as to what was taking place since there was no lead into them.",1401580800,,693,4.702479338842975

883150,2,6304458975,"***Seriously, several plot spoilers are below.

Even if the plot is rather fantastic, its premise has an allure -- what would you do if you were an eyewitness to a felonious act committed by the President, and everyone else who was there was committed to covering it up??

That said, there were moments in the film that defied sense even in the movie's own terms. For example, Gloria Russel notices that the letter opener was left upstairs and sends the SS (Secret Service) back to fetch it. But why did they approach the room of the crime warily and with guns drawn? They had no expectation that anyone else was there (except the corpse). Eastwood, the director, was using an ordinary trick to make it ""suspenseful"", even though the trick made no sense.

Speaking of suspense, why do would-be snipers (and their directors) have to laboriously snick and click their long-range rifles as they assemble them? This device is old, hoary and irritating (as are the directors who have to over-amplify the sound). But again, an easy trick to build suspense. Except we viewers have to view it twice, once for each sniper.

(warning - spoiler) I get why the first sniper was spooked by the reflecting glass. But why was the second? I suppose the second was startled by the first's gun shot. But wait, both are consummate professionals, used to taking tough shots under stressful situations. We saw the second at the target range put 5-6 rounds in a 3 inch circle at 100 hundred yards, standing up! And he was, we suppose, out of practice (why else would he have been at the target range?). But then, both snipers were pros, with years of tough experience. Neither would have been spooked!! In ""the real"" reality. That's what their training is about. And don't get me started with the first sniper's sticking the barrel of the rifle wayyyy out the window. How's that for inviting detection!!! Nor would he do something as none-productive as firing dry rounds at various persons before Luther comes. But, of course, director Eastwood needs some (cheesy) way to amp up the suspense.

And say, why were there only two Secret Service men around? Where was their commander?? I mean, they are in a serious ""situation"" here, and in the other reality, namely, real life, they would have gone to their commander for direction and support. (Since the white SS guy was especially conflicted by the situation.)

Finally, (definite spoiler alert), the movie's ending. Character Walter Sullivan looked rather frail in the movie, walking with a cane. The audience is supposed to believe that he overpowered Mr. XXX in a knife fight??!! And since we viewers are all trained criminologists (having graduated from 300 hours of watching Law and Order), we all know about entry wounds, angle of attack, and likely traces of blood on WS after his fight. And we know how CAREFULLY(!!!!) the death of XXX would have been reconstructed. Yet the White House staff conveniently accepts the verdict of suicide by knife (rather a demanding way to do it, unless you are samurai, and from a president who appears otherwise rather chipper, happy, content).

Altogether, this movie had a nice premise, but for me was rather spoiled by a ham-fisted director playing to the cheap seats.",1375574400,,3242,4.830630630630631

883325,5,6304458975,"In the midst of the White House Trilogy of scandals for 2013, this movie just seemed to fit the bill. As L. Shirley said in the headline of her review for this, it's ""Clint vs. The White House...Who Will Win?...Well, You Know!""

This is your typical Clint Eastwood character--not someone especially filled with virtue--especially the virtue we'd expect to find in a hero. He is his usual rough, cantankerous, ""do not bother me"" and ""do not bother with me"" loner that he is so good at portraying. Falling back on his skill as one of the top six known thieves, in the midst of a huge heist he finds himself face-to-face with being a witness to murder by the US President and two of his Secret Service agents. Although his initial instinct is to run and skip the country, his sense of justice for the victim and the criminal, that he has always portrayed in his own peculiar way, keeps him set as he unravels the ""how to"" bring the President and his staff to justice. He makes progress in a way that Washington never could or would with such an issue, as we are witnessing! It's all filled with suspense--something he does so well, especially as Director. It seems a good morale-booster also at this time.

His somewhat heartless attitude towards life, family, etc. gets overcome in the process of this whole affair. What could be seen as cynical and selfish, with obvious shortage of affection in the sparse interactions that have made up his relationship with his daughter over decades, kind of explodes into the deep moving love for her that has remained hidden, but now has the opportunity to move to the surface. Yeah! The same kind of smokescreen we've seen before, but when cleared away reveals his true character, and what his ultimate priorities and values are.

It's a great movie. It's a thriller! I put it up there with some of his best.

I have always loved Clint Eastwood's acting. I now love his directing.

883450,3,6304458975,"Sorry no summaries of the plot, opinions on acting or whether I liked the movie or not.  If I didn't like it I wouldn't have bought it.  My reviews focus only on the quality of the transfer to blu ray itself.

When I first inserted the disc and saw the menu my expectations went into the toilet as the menu was a still photo image with only 'language', ""play, and 'scene selection'.  There are no extras whatsoever.  However, the transfer shows a Mbps average rate of between mid teens and lower 30s so there has to be an improvement over the standard def version somewhere.

Video...From the dark opening scenes and throughout the rest of the film  you are presented with a video transfer marked by excessively crushed blacks, far more than I remember the initial release as being.  There really aren't many details in the darker/shadow areas even when the scene is in brighter daylight.  That said, the crushed blacks that appear to go below 0 IRE may have been by design.  The color resolutions are somewhat muted and slightly bleach bypassed but the contrast levels are really quite decent.  There is film grain but no grain that seems intrusive or distracting.  I saw no artifacting at all.  However, and this is a first for me ever seeing this...at 35 minutes into the film, Clint's character runs into his daughter jogging in the park.  There ensues a conversation between them and  the camera is shooting a medium closeup back and forth between both.  If you look at their shoulders and neck you actually see a green haloed outline.  This made me think that perhaps this scene was done in front of a blue or green screen that was poorly chroma keyed.  As an editor, I recognized the green outline and the only time I have ever seen this is when someone does not do a chroma keying job properly.  At no point in any other part of the film did I see this.  I was surprised to see some fisheye lens used in certain scenes that I had never noticed in previous watchings.  The transfer to Blu Ray is not bad, it is just not the best I have seen before.

The audio defaults to its DTSMA 5.1 lossless sound and it is the star of the BR.  There was surprisingly good panning across the front stage and discreet channeling as well.  Not much here done to incorporate the rear stage but there were a couple of discreet channels back there as well, just a few.  The audio levels seemed to me to be properly set though you initially might need to adjust your volume level a touch higher than normal. Once set you should not have to go back and forth with your remote's volume control.

Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, and that I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

We tried adjusting the audio level to a point where we could always understand the dialog which made some of the sound effects a little louder than optimum.

883672,4,6304458975,"Clint Eastwood's 1997 movie ""Absolute Power"" has a rather novel premise, in which the bad guy is the President of the United States, the good guy is an elusive master thief, and the Secret Service and police get caught in-between.  A strong cast, including Gene Hackman, E.G. Marshall, Ed Harris, Scott Glen, Dennis Haysbert, and Laura Linney, carries the movie.

As the story opens, master thief Luther Whitney (Eastwood) inadvertantly witnesses the shooting death by the Secret Service of a politically-connected young woman, after her tryst with a sadistic president (Hackman) goes badly.  Whitney escapes, to be targeted by the Secret Service.  The leading DC detective on the case (Harris) and Prosecutor (Linney) develop their doubts about the ""official"" version of the crime, only to discover the Secret Secret is dogging their footsteps with a different agenda.  Linney's prosecutor finds her situation compromised by her status as Luther's estranged daughter.  Luther Whitney will have to find a way to stay alive and free long enough to implicate the real killer, while minimizing the collateral damage.

""Absolute Power"" creates its suspense through a clever if rather implausible plot and nuanced performances by the cast.  Ed Harris is superb as the detective trying to find a killer, while Gene Hackman is convincing as a cynical and bombastic politician dodging disaster.  ""Absolute Power"" is recommended to Eastwood fans.",1334707200,,1437,5.351111111111111

883678,5,6304458975,"Right now I'm kicking myself for spending so many years ignoring a huge pile of classic Clint Eastwood films... and I'm not even sure whether Absolute Power qualifies as a classic. With just under 80 reviews here on amazon, I imagine not. Oh well, I thoroughly enjoyed it and that's the only thing that really matters.

It's about Clint Eastwood playing the character of a professional jewelry thief who breaks into a museum/mansion one night and carefully plots through all the clever devices designed to protect the expensive jewels. However, once he arrives to an upstairs bedroom, he hears someone coming through the door...

It's actually two people- a man (the president of the United States) and a woman. Well you can pretty much guess why they're breaking into a bedroom- to showcase a little late night action! Meanwhile Clint's hiding in a closet nearby watching the entire scene take place. Unfortunately for the woman, the man has a vicious and abusive side that soon reveals itself much to the chagrin of the woman.

What happens next is honestly *extremely* shocking and I don't want to spill the storyline beans so to speak- just realize that the entire 30 minutes in the beginning is quite entertaining for action fans. In fact, this film is mostly about action and suspense, and little of the plotline has to do with politics. It's a ""How will Clint find a clever way out of THIS mess?"" kind of storyline. Once his daughter enters the picture, the plot thickens. It's awesome.

By the way, a couple actors and actresses from that hit TV show 24 make an appearance here.  I'm referring to the guy who portrays the president (Dennis Haysbert, better known as David Palmer) and his wife (who appeared in the earlier years of the shows existence) are both major characters in Absolute Power, and it makes me wonder if the writers of 24 hired them specifically because of their excellent performance in this movie.

Everything about this film is just spectacular. Clint Eastwood has the same old facial expressions that we've come to love, he of course narrowly (and miraculously) escapes a few life or death situations, he takes advantage of his jewelry-stealing skills to send the cops running off in another direction, and the movie is just fantastic the entire way through so I highly recommend it.",1320537600,,2314,4.845569620253165

883742,5,6304458975,"There is a rule in Hollywood: when a Democrat is in office, movies about the President of the United States should portray decent and honorable men, like Air Force One and The American President. But when a Republican in office, the President should be addle brained and/or evil, like the senile old man who launches a war in Clear and Present Danger.

Unfortunately, Absolute Power was released when Bill Clinton was President, so the critics were predisposed to damn it. And that is unfortunate, because it is one of Eastwood's best. If Bob Dole had been elected in 1996, this would have been regarded by The New York Times and The Washington Post's critics as the classic that it is.

The plot might be a bit far-fetched, but it is a great parable about the corruption of power and a reminder that truth isn't always on the side of the most powerful. No wonder The New York Times hated it! William Goldman's script is spot on.

The cast is A-1. Laura Linney is an attractive woman, but she does not have movie star looks, which makes her perfect as the daughter who discovers she really hadn't been abandoned by her jewel thief father. Judy Davis is terrific as the President's Chief of Staff slowly going crazy. A scene where she is dancing with the President while she discovers that the necklace she is wearing was worn by the murdered woman is a classic.

The action scenes are wonderful. A scene where Eastwood
manages to evade two separate assassins and the Washington police is a great set piece.

Of all the excellent aspects of the movie, its humor, its thrilling plot, the very best is the endearing father and daughter relationship between Eastwood and Linney.

The film is good at showing how things could be hushed up in the USA, and in fact cannot. They always try but they mostly and most often fail, because there is a fink or a mole somewhere. Luckily for us. Though they are quite better at hushing up a crime that has to do with something more serious than a sexual offense, even accompanied with murder. For example the lying and the forging of evidence, necessarily false then, like with a certain George W Bush. Or deciding not to count millions of votes that would give the victory to the one they don't want like with Al Gore. The weakness of the film is also the key to its ending. The use of the husband of the girl who is killed, a quite old man indeed, and the main supporter of the President. This reveals the completely mentally deranged psychology of this President, of his main supporter and of the system they are living in. The suicide of the President is not an act of justice, but only an act to escape justice. No one, not even the President, has the right to evade justice and make his own justice, even on himself. The role of the police, when they know, which is the case here, is not to close their eyes on that kind of en ending, or to cover up another more radical ending for the unwanted witness of the crime, but to arrest the murderer and prevent him from escaping normal justice, which is the justice of the people, for the people and by the people and not justice for only individual, to quote the Gettysburg address.

The film begins in a museum. Artists are sketching. Luther enters a bar, then returns home. What will he do at night? How does he know about that secret room? But he hears a slight noise and hides. An older man and a young woman walk into the room. Later there is a struggle. Two guards end the fight. ""What the hell is that?"" ""Nothing we haven't heard before."" They clean up the mess. They will blame a burglar. The burglar escapes the house but not detection; he is able to outrun younger men in top shape. Did they get the plate number? The blood spatter tells about the crime. Strangle then shoot her at a distance from behind? Walter Sullivan tells about his relationship with his young wife. Later we see President Alan Richmond. ""Tennis elbow.""

Luther gets new passports for his departure. The police continue the investigation. Two different bullets? Sullivan hires a private detective. The police list the top burglars in the country, only one is in Washington. Police detective Seth Frank questions Luther about the crime. Sullivan was a backer of the president. Miss Kate Whitney is a Prosecutor but knows little about Luther. Can she help bring him in? Will Luther believe her? The trap is set. Are there snipers waiting? Will the plan fail? Luther planned ahead. He tells his daughter what happened. What will he do? ""Its dangerous outside."" Miss Russell gets a gift. Will the Secret Service guard Kate Whitney? Will there be a car chase to provide action? Is the hospital room safe? ""That was unacceptable."" Will Luther confess to Walter Sullivan? What will he do? [The ending is ambiguous.] The news media report the tragedy in the White House. ""I'm still here."" Will they be just fine?

This, like some other Eastwood movies, seems to run on too long. Would a president go on a Top Secret Mission with only two guards? Would the Secret Service cover up a major felony by the president? No, this is the flaw in the story. A talented and moral burglar who returns millions in loot? Could a Federal Prosecutor have a father who was a career criminal? This is a fantasy that has a hidden agenda. I'm not buying it.",1272844800,,2154,4.648293963254593

He is planning what is suppose to be his last job, and everything is going smoothly until some come in before he can leave. He hides in a secret room and from behind a one-way mirror sees that it's the wife of the owner of the house he is robbing and another man. They are fooling around when the guy decides to liven things up by striking her, she get away but he corners her, she then grabs a letter opener and is about to stab him when he cries out for help when two men come in and shoot her dead. It seems that the man is Alan Richmond, the President of the United States and the two men are the secret service agents assigned to him. Later, a woman, Gloria Russell, who is his Chief of Staff enters and upon learning of what has happened, decides to cover it up and make it appear that she was killed by a burglar. After sanitizing the room, they are about to leave but they forget the letter opener, Whitney comes out of the room and takes it and makes his getaway but when they returned for the letter opener they discover Whitney and chase him but he gets away. The police investigate the murder and there are so many inconsistencies, which makes the investigator, Seth Frank suspect that something is going on. Frank then discovers that Whitney is a possible suspect but the only thing is that he doesn't believe that Whitney is a killer. Whitney tries to leave town but when he learns just how corrupt and amoral Richmond is he decides to play mind games with him and the others. Richmond, at the same time, tells them that Whitney must be silenced permanently. Eastwood's direction is simply outstanding. The opening sequence where he explores the neatly kept mansion for his robbery is the best moment in the entire movie, you will be literally on the edge of your seat.

The now aging Luther, having done his time and paid his debt to society, wants nothing more than to reconnect with his only child, a very successful attorney. She, on the other hand, disdains his overtures, knowing a tiger cannot change his stripes. The detective on the murder case convinces her to contact Luther; but, not surprisingly, the bad guys have tapped her phone.

I bought this movie without even watching it once, I saw the actors list and read the plot on the back of the dvd and thought to myself ""This got to be the hell of a movie"".
After finishing I didn't think the same. I mean, it has great actors and the story is great but it has something missing for my opinion, things get smooth really easy at the end.
However I haven't regreted the fact of buying it, is a good movie, not just as good as you could imagine.
The caracter played by Eastwood is, opposite to what you may think a great father, and he would do anything to protect his daughter.
Ed Hackman's caracter is a coward hidding behind secret services... I love him when he loses (like in Runaway Jury for example).

883934,5,6304458975,"This film is one of my all time Clint Eastwood favorites.  He plays the kind of semi bad guy that you root for.  You almost hope he pulls off the big heist and gets away with it and lives happily ever after because he is Clint.  If you can accept the fact that this plot borders on total fantasy, could never happen and defies logic time and time again, you will enjoy the scenario.  Lennie Niehaus' film score is perfect in creating the eery and sinister mood throughout the film and Clint's own playing of the piano theme is beautiful and haunting.  Gene Hackman as the president is truly the screen's best on screen bad guy and Ed Harris is his usual natural and believable self as the ""live alone"" head detective.  With that being said you must ask yourself: Why and how were the president's trysts unaccounted for by his staff and the media?  When E.G. Marshall's wife was murdered there was apparently no investigation even though he was very prominent.  When Clint met his daughter at the outside cafe the whole area was surrounded by police but apparently Clint didn't see any of them.  When the secret service man was killed in the hospital apparently no questions were asked and no investigation took place and Clint was never a suspect.  When the president presumably committed suicide E.G. Marshall was never suspected even though he was the only witness and no questions were asked why the president fatally stabbed himself at that specific time.  Minor details, right?

The basis of the book was built around him defending Luther and finding out the truth. In the book the daughter hates Luther, in this she just vaguely dislikes him.

883939,5,6304458975,"Absolute Power is not among Clint Eastwood greatest films, but it's much better than is usually given credit for. A dark thriller, directed as professionally and bleakly as only Eastwood can do it, Absolute Power centers around Luther Whitney, a professional burglar (Eastwood himself, in one of his best performances in the last decade), who finds himself in a classic wrong place, wrong time situation - while robbing a luxurious mansion, he accidentally witnesses a sexual assault and a murder, and the subsequent cover-up, that involves the President of the United States and the White House staff. That scene at the very beginning of the movie is probably the strongest one in it, Eastwood making brilliant use of cinematography, music (and especially the lack of) and his trademark heavy contrasted lighting, and with almost no dialogue at all, it's a remarkably effective scene that overshadows much of the rest of the film.

Still, as the film turns into a more standard conspiracy-thriller, it holds its own quite well, mainly due to William Goldman's wonderful script (as his always are, this is the genius who wrote 'The Princess Bride', 'Marathon Man', 'Misery' and 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', among others) and most of all thanks to the absolutely fantastic all-star cast; other than Clint himself, who is ideal as the charming, ruthless but honest criminal, fantastic performances are also given by Gene Hackman as the President and by Ed Harris as the detective on the case. The rest of the excellent cast includes Laura Linney ('Primal Fear') as Luther's daughter; the fantastic Judy Davis ('Naked Lunch', 'Barton Fink') as the President's sneaky assistant; Scott Glenn ('Buffalo Soldiers'); Dennis Haysbert ('Far From Heaven'); E.G. Marshall ('Tora! Tora! Tora!'); Penny Johnson ('24'); and Richard Jenkins ('Six Feet Under'). As is usually the case with Clint Eastwood's films, all the actors seem to have been hand-picked by him directly, rather than participated in an audition, because each character seems to have been designed specifically for the actor portraying them. Because of that cast and the brilliant directing and dialogue, Absolute Power is an entirely gripping watch, even if the story is at times less than entirely convincing and just a little fragmented.

Absolute Power tries to make its mark on three levels - the thriller level is the only one where it completely succeeds, and it manages to be constantly exciting, gripping and enticing. It works slightly less well on the human level, because the inter-character relationships are rather poorly developed. Laura Linney's character in particular is underdeveloped, and so the father-daughter relationship element hardly carries any weight in the story, and neither does her relationship with Ed Harris's character. As there is no interaction between Eastwood's character and Hackman's, the only relationships that are worth mentioning are the ones between Eastwood and Harris, which is strictly superficial and based on mutual respect, and the one between Hackman and Marshall, who plays the old billionaire who funded Hackman's rise to the presidency. The third level on which the film works is as political commentary; there it achieves partial success, as the story often seems contrived (although, one might note, not as contrived as we may imagine). Still, it can give you a general idea of how absolute power corrupts, and of the kind of horrors that the intricate systems of democracy might hide; but it's not to be taken too literally. The strongest elements of the story are the mystery, and Clint Eastwood's character, clearly the strongest in the film; as such it's a solid and enticing thriller with lots of atmosphere and wonderful acting, that will keep you glued to your seat.",1130112000,,3793,5.216393442622951
884034,1,6304458975,"Warning: this review reveals many things about the book but nothing about the movie. I don't know how they could say that this movie is based on the book. The only thing that is really the same is the burglary in the beginning. I know how movies based on books how to cut out many parts to make it fit until the right amount of time but i never thought that they could take out the main charactor and hero. Jack Graham was the best part of the book and Clint Eastwood cut him out to make himself the main charactor. Also they made the billionare Walter Sulivan seem like a complete idiot because Luther had to tell him who killed his wife. Sulivan was a very smart man and figured it out by himself. This movie cut out many important factors of the book that made it more suspenseful. Deaths like: Walter Sulivan, Luther Whitney, Sandy Lord, Sandy Lord's mistress, and Bill Burton. I am suprised that they even killed Christy Sulivan in the first place. Also they left out many key elements of the book such as: Jack for a big one, Russell and Collin's affair, the knife being destroyed, everyones death that I mentioned before, and Kate's relationship with her father.

  This movie pissed me off very much becuase it left out all of the suspence that Baldacci put in. I mean when Luther kills Collin it sounds like something straight out of Dirty Hairy ""Mercy,"" said Collin ""I fresh out,"" replied Luther. I mean come it's cool for an action movie with no plot but this book is one of my favorites and the movie ruined my mental image of it.

884035,4,6304458975,"Absolute Power may not be an overly special film but it was the first movie I saw in the cinema after leaving high school. I was certainly not the target audience but it had my attention from the first scene and maintained the suspense for the during of the running time, even if it doesn't build to much.

Clint Eastwood plays Luther Whitney, an expert thief who targets billionaire industrialist Walter Sullivan (grouchy old EG Marshall, in his last theatrical movie) while he is off on vacation. While in the midst of cleaning out the vault the President of the United States (Gene Hackman) enters the room with Sullivan's wife. Whitney hides in the vault, which has a two-way mirror, and witnesses the President get a little too rough with the woman, which ends in her fighting him off and being murdered by the secret service. The Chief of Staff concocts a plan to cover up the murder not knowing that Whitney is watching the whole thing. As the group leave he escapes, taking a crucial piece of evidence with him.

Initially unsure what to do, Whitney decides to taunt the President, though it's not clear what his complete plan is or even if he's just free-forming. If one should fault Absolute Power for any reason it's that it establishes a lot of plot and potential but never really does anything with it and ends with an anti-climactic cop-out.

Where it succeeds is with the small cast of characters who really make the dialogue and relationships work. Ed Harris as the confused but dedicated cop investigating the case, Laura Linney as Whitney's resentful daughter, and the austere Scott Glenn as the self-doubting agent make every scene effortless even when there's not much happening.

Adapted from (and streamlined and improved in the process) the bloated novel by David Baldacci (I call them 'Airport novels' - those 600-page bricks with generic covers featuring nothing but the title and author in giant gold letters in a tacky font) the screenplay makes many changes but they are all for the better.  Eastwood's direction is slow and steady - or 'mature'. The pace and framing is the antidote for anyone bored to tears with the nauseating aesthetic of today's comic-book movies and CGI nightmares.

A curious thing about the beginning of the movie is that Clint Eastwood only has 2 lines of dialogue for the entire 35 minutes. I don't understand why he didn't cut them out and remain silent, which would give the film a peculiar edge.

The Blu-ray features a fine 2.40 1080p transfer with an active, spatial DTS HD-MA soundtrack. There are zero features.",1120780800,,2573,4.8076923076923075

It perfectly fits the three star grade but that doesnt mean its a bad movie. It's just that it's probably one of the best three start movies you will see.

Ed Harris acts really well in this film and there's this certain level of professionalism I notice in Sir Clint Eastwood which is what I appreciate about him.

It is simply captivating to watch stalwarts exchange fairly taut dialogue.

 The denouement comes a bit hot-footed and wraps up loose ends a bit too neatly, making you think ""Why didn't they just do that earlier?"" and leaving you with an after-taste that the film lacked consistence or even any real depth. E.g., couldn't we have done without the subplot involving the daughter? Why not use Ed Harris a bit more? etc.

884043,5,6304458975,"With MYSTIC RIVER being the most recent example, director Clint Eastwood shows why his movies are so powerful:  the casting and the expert, effective direction.  Eastwood the director is much better than Eastwood the actor, and there are times I wish he'd cast others in the roles he takes.  But that aside, this political thriller soars because of the wonderful actors and the way Clint works with them to bring out the best, even in smaller, seemingly insignificant scenes.  Let's look at some of these performances:
GENE HACKMAN - an outstanding actor who always gives a hundred percent doesn't get a lot of screen time in this one, but of course his scenes are pivotal and his ability to create such a devious and self-centered liar are brilliant.
LAURA LINNEY - one of our most consistently good actresses, Laura takes the cliche role of abandoned daughter, but fills it with the hurt that comes from that; the love that still wants to get out, and her devotion to the man she feels abandoned her.  Her scene with Ed Harris in which she goes to her father's apartment and sees all the pictures is wonderful.
ED HARRIS - he plays a smart cop and an attractive, lonely one at that.  His falling for Linney is understandable, and Harris controls his performance brilliantly.
SCOTT GLENN & DENNIS HAYSBERT as the secret service men are very different and the contrast works well.  Glenn is remorseful over his actions; Haysbert is obviously a man who likes to kill and feel power.  Their supporting contribution is essential to the movie.
E.G. MARSHALL - this late great actor has never been better.  An 80 year old billionaire with a young wife who he really loves faces her tragic death and seeks revenge.  And yet, he had a room built where he could watch this young wife screw around with younger and more virile men just to prove he loved her.  Marshall's scene in the limo with Clint is also very moving.
JUDY DAVIS - this talented actress at times reminded me of Cruella Deville with her flashy arm movements and histrionics, but as her character develops, one can see the motivation behind these gestures, and the deep passion she feels for Hackman.
A very well done and enthralling movie.",1075852800,,2198,4.712793733681462
884101,4,6304458975,"At the start of ""Absolute Power"" Luther Whitne (Clint Eastwood), cat burglar par excellence, finds himself in a very strange situation.  While robbing a rich man's safe in a large bedroom closet, he is interrupted by the appearance of a man and woman who head straight for the bed.  While hiding in the closet, where he sees what is going on through a two-way mirror, he watches while the sex play gets rough: the man hits her, she stabs him with a letter opener, and then two men come into the room and shoot her.  Luther gets out of there, but while his presence was undetected it does not go undiscovered.  The problem is that the man he was watching happens to be the President of the United States (Gene Hackman).
Now, I have to stop at this point and tell you that one of my cinematic pet peeves is the idea that the United States Secret Service will let the president do anything, no matter how stupid or reckless, without batting an eye.  Indeed, in ""Absolute Power"" there are two such agents, who help to cover up the murder and then try to track down Luther and kill him.  However, the actors playing those two agents happen to be Scott Glenn and Dennis Haysbert, which is an important fact because a lot of the faults in this film area absolved by the casting, the credit for which goes to the film's director: Clint Eastwood.
The hook for this thriller is the idea that the president, his Chief of Staff (Judy Davis), and the Secret Service are out to get Luther, whose stated intention is to get out of town and get lost as quick as possible.  But the key to this film ends up being a rather odd romantic triangle that exists between Luther, his estranged daughter, Kate (Laura Linney), and the D.C. homicide cop, Seth Frank (Ed Harris), who is assigned to the murder.  Frank interviews Luther, not because he thinks the old con is a murderer, but because he is one of the few that could have pulled off the heist.  He then moves on to Kate, hoping to get her to persuade her father to turn himself in before the wrath of the rich man (E.G. Marshall) whose wife is dead comes crashing down on him.  Frank clearly likes Kate and is rather impressed by Luther, which is good because I like smart cops.  For his part, Luther clearly has some admiration for the detective and also likes his taste in women.
My favorite scene in this movie is when Frank takes Kate to her father's house, where she has never been, and (knowing where Luther hides the key), takes her inside.  In one room she finds a gallery of photographs, of all of the key moments in her life after her father left.  ""She was at none of these,"" she insists to Frank, although clearly that was never the case and we can see in an instant that she is rethinking her entire relationship with her father.  As much as it is fun to watch Luther outsmart the cops, the Secret Service, and the hitman sent by old man Sullivan, the heart of this film is between Luther and Kate.  Even when she sets him up, believing it to be the only way of helping keep her father alive, he surprises her by showing up.  His reasoning?  He did not want her to believe he was a murderer.  Besides, his daughter wanted to see him.
I understand the script by William Goldman is quite different from David Balducci's novel, but that simply has to do with Eastwood playing Luther (if you read the novel you will understand why this would matter in terms of the significant changes).  Eastwood's direction is competent as always, and, as I mentioned above, he gets the credit for being able to bring together such a solid cast for one of his projects (who would turn down a Clint Eastwood movie?).  Final Note: the White House Tour Guide is played by the director's daughter, Kimber Eastwood.",1074643200,,3738,4.429197080291971
884102,5,6304458975,All of Eastwood's directorial efforts are strong but this is one of his best.  This film is like a great pulp story elevated to classic status by Eastwood's skillful direction of actors and his sense of pacing.  My personal favorites of the films Eastwood has directed are in this order: 1. Play Misty For Me 2. Unforgiven 3. Mystic River 4. High Plains Drifter 5. Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil 6. Absolute Power 7. A Perfect World.  All of his films are good that he has directed so check them out.  Hackman and Haysbert are ruthless in this.  Great acting!,1071014400,,568,4.475728155339806

884105,5,6304458975,"I enjoyed this movie very much. I didn't mind that there were plot holes here and there-I just didn't care. It was entertaining and gripping and I loved every minute of it. I especially loved that I didn't know *anything* about the plot of the movie as I watched it. There were a few extra surprises for me along the way, which enhanced my enjoyment of the movie.
I loved Clint Eastwood's character. He's such a wiley and resourceful fellow, definitely able and capable. But he's not above playing the ""age card"", and making mentions of his AARP membership, and trying to pass himself off as someone who is too old to do anything interesting anymore. The twinkle in his eye as he starts in with the age thing is very amusing indeed.
The rest of the cast in this film is also very good-special cudos for E.G. Marshall, in one of his last roles. His performance is articulate and strong and spot-on. Ed Harris has that friendly, open face, and he's very likeable in this movie. He's also able to show a sweet sense of humor. (The line, ""I live alone"" will have a special significance after you see this movie!) Gene Hackman is great as a wimpy yet simultaniously slimy character. Judy Davis is absolutely wonderful too-as an evil ice queen hiding behind the mask of an attractive woman. Dennis Haysbert (now playing Palmer in ""24"") and character actor Scott Glenn are good in their roles as well.
The best part in this film, in my opinion, are the scenes between Eastwood and his estranged daughter, played by Laura Linney. Their relationship is what makes this movie stand out. Eastwood's character has been seemingly so distant from his daughter for so many years; yet she's  still his ""little girl"" and we see how deeply he loves her as the film progresses.
This is a worthwhile film, and very entertaining. Recommended.",1040342400,,1821,4.65527950310559

Eastwood Again takes the Directors chair, and for good measure, he Produces and Stars as well.
The Performances are Definitely the films Strong Suit. Apart from Eastwood and Hackman's Top-Billed Triumphs, we get Ed Harris as the Brilliant Detective on the case, Seth Frank. Harris downplays his role and makes it all look Totally Natural. Scott Glenn also makes an Impression in a Smaller role as a Disgruntled Secret Service Agent.
The Biggest Problem I have with the film is its Poorly Written Female element. Laura Linney plays Luther's Daughter and Judy Davis plays a Presidential Advisor. Their Dialogue is Annoying and it makes their Performances Annoying, they are both Talented Actresses who Deserve Better.

He's almost caught and then witnesses a sleazy sex liaison and murder performed by the President of the United States (Gene Hackman -who mercilessly chews the scenery in this one).  Unfortunately what follows becomes more and more unbelievable and the film disintegrates as unrealistic characters appear in the film and it becomes another dumb wanna-be-Hollywood blockbuster kind of film.

Not just any murder but one which happens to involved the president of the United States (Gene Hackman, always a good villain). He cannot very well report what he has seen since it will implicate him in his thievery. Ed Harris is the detective who is trying to lure Eastwood into admitting the robbery. Harris also develops a crush on Eastwood's estranged daughter (Laura Linney). Eventually the president and his aides who cover up the murder become aware of Eastwood's cognizance of the murder and aim to harm him... or what is close to him (they go after his daughter).

884175,3,6304458975,"Given its pedigree, and the talent on offer in every department, ""Absolute Power"" ought to be Absolutely Stunning. However, except for two sequences, it is merely competant entertainment.
The first great moment is a conversation in the Museum between Ed Harris (a cop investigating a robbery and murder) and Clint Eastwood (a known jewel thief). Harris suspects Eastwood, and is hoping to trick him into an admission by asking for ""advice"" on how the crime might have been committed. Eastwood did in fact commit the break-in and witnessed the murder, neither of which facts he wants to reveal. The conversation is a delightful cat-and-mouse game, acknowledged as such by both characters while they continue playing. It ends with Eastwood remarking that he must leave to go and have his pace-maker checked: Harris counters that he will be back tomorrow: ""Tomorrow is promised to no-one,"" comes the rejoinder.
The second is a consumately filmed conversation between Gene Hackman and Judy Davis (respectively the U.S President and his Chief of Staff) while they give an exhibition-dance at a formal White House function. As they waltz, the President reveals to Davis that she is unknowingly wearing a necklace belonging to the murder-victim; in turn, Davis tells him that incriminating evidence is in the hands of Eastwood, who may use it to expose them both. As they trade this ghastly information back and forth in front of the assembled dignitaries, they have to pretend to be having a light-hearted, joking conversation.

Absolute Power has reasonably good acting, Clint Eastwood is  impressive as usual, but Gene Hackman seems somewhat miscast. The script is  clever and mostly intriguing, but not faultless. In places, Absolute Power  is far too slow, and the fairly long running time makes you get a bit  squeamish.

7871550,4,6304458975,"Clint Eastwood excellently leads political intrigue in Absolute Power.

Absolute Power is one of Clint Eastwood's best movies. It is a highly relevant crime thriller about a thief, played by Eastwood, who witnesses a crime. He struggles with moral boundaries that implicate people in high places. It is a highly entertaining role for Eastwood who displays a lot of charisma.

The supporting cast really performances well with Gene Hackman playing a corrupt political figure that will remind you of his Lex Luthor back in Superman. Hackman is devilishly rotten and so very engaging. Ed Harris is the resolute police detective that must solve the case and he plays it cool as ever. Laura Linney is really relatable and grounds Eastwood's character nicely as his daughter. Scott Glenn has a particularly intriguing Secret Service character that feels like a great foil to Hackman. Absolute Power revels in its brilliant cast and their delightful acting.

The costumes are accurate and pretty neatly arranged in Absolute Power. The music goes from tense to unnerving in the background. It is quickly edited and leads to a fast paced thriller atmosphere. The cinematography is quite clever, often making you feel like you are there with Eastwood.

Overall, Clint Eastwood directs Absolute Power with a great deal of care and clever camera angles. The performances are all quite good and standouts in their respective careers. While Absolute Power is mostly forgotten to time, it is well worth revisiting for the political relevance, mystery, intrigue, and acting. It is better than other reviews are saying by far.",1525651200,,1609,5.176923076923077
