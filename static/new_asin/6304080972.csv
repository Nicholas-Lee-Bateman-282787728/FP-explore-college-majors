774903,5,6304080972,i don't care what other people say ed was an awesome and heartwarming story so i gave it a five. I recomend this movie  :),1260057600,,122,3.88
774904,2,6304080972,"This movie is not so great.  However, Matt LeBlanc is comes off as his usual likable, adorable self and so you're not cringing the whole way through.",1210032000,,149,4.518518518518518
774905,1,6304080972,"First of all, I have to wonder what Courtney Cox, David Schwimmer and the rest of the ""Friends"" cast said to Matt LeBlanc when this stinker hit the big screen. This puppy came out right in the middle of the whole Must-See-TV heyday. If any of them gave praise to this film, and were believable....then they all deserved Emmys! There is truly nothing enjoyable about ""Ed"". I love a good goofy ""monkey"" movie. I grew up watching ""Tarzan"" flicks, just so I could see Cheetah make some goofy faces every now and again. Today, my kids and I chuckle at stuff like ""MVP: Most Valuable Primate"" or ""Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp"". I guess the key ingredient is that most successful monkey movies, actually feature a real monkey..not some person in a monkey suit. And not a monkey who somehow is over 5 feet tall in some shots. Monkeys are fun and funny to watch....people in monkey costumes are just embarassing! Now this may sound like I'm slamming the movie, but I actually recommend you see this stink-fest. There should be college courses dedicated to ""Ed"" in film school detailing just HOW NOT TO MAKE A MOVIE. You will be amazed at just how awful this film is. You have to truly see it to appreciate it's awfulness. I can now sit through ""Battlefield Earth"", ""Ishtar"", ""Waterworld"" and any other bad movie you wanna throw my way because I've now seen the worst Hollywood has to offer...I've seen ""Ed"".",1208217600,5,1397,4.637096774193548
774906,3,6304080972,Ed was a welcome edition to this film. The role was filled well and did not dissapoint. Matt LeBlanc could do no wrong at this point of his career. Sequel.?,1186790400,,156,4.233333333333333
774907,1,6304080972,"""Ed"" is beyond bad: it is well into the realm of legend. You might not have expected that a well-funded Hollywood production could be so wretched,but you will become convinced once you have seen it. LeBlanc plays ""Deuce,"" a country bumpkin turned minor league baseball player. The back story is well established with LeBlanc on his farm milking cows and refusing to eat ham that came from his favorite pig. He wears a John Deere cap (I honestly hope John Deere didn't actually pay for this ill-conceived product placement) to further establish the character. The cap makes LeBlanc look as much like a farmer as a tutu would make Marlon Brando look like a ballerina.

Deuce gets signed by a minor league club, the Rockets, and is quickly assigned to live with the new mascot and third baseman, Ed Sullivan, a chimpanzee. Needless to say, Ed is hilarious (in theory) and gets into all sorts of wacky situations. Most of the situations are at the comedic level of the Three Stooges (if they had lobotomies) and feature such antics as forced toupee removal, making Deuce eat dog food, and lots and lots of flatus. Not only is the humor of gluteal crepitation repeatedly highlighted, but other bathroom-related issues regularly emerge. Thank goodness Ed knows how to use deodorizer spray!

Ed initially is a mascot, but longs to play ball. After an official rules that ""there's no rule requiring a player to be a Homo sapiens"" Ed becomes the third baseman. Needless to say, this can't go without plot thickening, and after Ed is traded by the idiot toupee-wearing owner's son, there are multiple monkeynappings and chimp electrocutions. Along the way, there's a dreadful romance subplot, as Ed and an annoying child actress teach Deuce about love and life. Also be sure not to miss a special guest appearance by Tommy Lasorda, and a tearjerker of a hospital scene after Ed nearly freezes to death in a banana truck. (Don't ask.) Fortunately for the cast, all ends well, though viewers may be emotionally scarred for life. Actually viewers are unlikely to recall much about the film inasmuch as the desire to sleep is nearly overpowering after the first ten minutes or so.

The film did leave me with a couple of questions, aside from the obvious one, ""Who thought this was a good enough idea to fund?"" The single question I am most curious about is why is Matt LeBlanc orange? I mean really, really orange. It's like he only ate carrots for a month before making the film, or perhaps used some kind of beta carotene face paint. Why would the director or makeup artists want him to look that way?

The film features the much more talented Zach Ward (billed as ""Zacharias Ward"" and of ""Titus"" fame) as a supporting player. There were a few other genuinely talented actors present in the credits, although I'm sure they have grave retrospective reservations about their roles in this mess.

The DVD also comes with a dreadful black and white short titled ""Perfect Control,"" which features Babe Ruth teaching school kids how to play baseball, and an unseemly appearance by the algebra teacher. You'll have to watch it to see how bad it is: better yet, don't watch it, or, for that matter, ""Ed"" either.

This is a film with the power to make a sports fan hate baseball for life. I recommend staying far away from this cinematic travesty at all costs.",1176076800,10,3340,4.740103270223752
774908,1,6304080972,"O.K., our P.E. teacher made us sit through this hour-and-fifteen minute load of junk one day during class one day. Let me say I only enjoyed the movie slightly because it beat being fried in the boiling heat outside. First of all, the plot has so many holes in it I seriously think that someone held the script up to the wall and shot twenty rounds at it. Secondly, I believe I watched an episode of Teletubbies once and laughed more then than I did during this movie. Finally, the movie is more bland than a block of tofu. No action, no drama, not the slightest trace of good humor.",1123286400,5,583,4.3090909090909095
774909,1,6304080972,"Jack ""Deuce"" Cooper (Matt LeBlanc) is a minor league baseball pitcher who's got the goods, but no self-confidence. Instead of looking up Dr. Phil, the team manager decides that a simian teammate is just what strike-out Deuce needs for a boost. Enter Ed, a chimp who's got more talent in his elongated little finger than the whole team put together. Ed's antics, including scarfing down chocolate-covered bananas and pulling toupees off of bald heads, were all ""aped"" by men in monkey suits and animatronics. Unfunny slapstick makes this DVD a real strike-out.

774910,5,6304080972,"Oh my god this has to be the best film i have EVER seen in my life. First things first, how did they train that monkey, he is as clever as einstein. My pal Mickso said its just a guy in a suit but that son of a gun isn't fooling me clap! clap! clap! well done mr monkey! Anyways i'd highly recommend this film.....and joining a stamp collecting club, they've both changed my life forever, in fact i hope to grow up to be a stamp collecting monkey actor....... with as many casio watches as i can eat.

775080,2,6304080972,"This COULD have been a very funny movie but it fell well short of the mark. Having a person dressed up as a monkey (a child, very short man???) with a very weird face instead of something cute, is not a good start. I don't know why they didn't use a real monkey and perhaps some computer simulations for stunts to make this a whole lot better.

This really IS a stinker, I couldn't even stay awake to see the last 30 minutes.",1410566400,,425,4.120481927710843

7860814,1,6304080972,"Nobody in the family (Mom, Dad, 11 yr boy, 9 yr boy) was too impressed. My youngest boy was mildly amused at times. But laughs were pretty rare and the movie relatively slow. Lots of unrealistic stuff with the chimpanzee. There is a scene where a group of teammates is in a bar doing shots, drinking beer and getting drunk. The next morning they are hung over. Were it not for that scene, it would probably be a perfect under 7 movie.",1520553600,,434,4.304878048780488
