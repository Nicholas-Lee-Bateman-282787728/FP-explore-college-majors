8490256,2,B0060ANZTW,"I've spent a long time looking for a copy of this movie at an affordable price, and was surprised when I found it in a double pack. The package descibes it as digitally remasterd, it's not. And the worst part is the movie cuts off during the final fight scene, maybe 90 seconds left in the movie and it jumps back to the menu screen.",1359331200,,333,4.138461538461539
