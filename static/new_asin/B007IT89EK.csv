8517823,5,B007IT89EK,"It's a bummer Shout! Factory opted not to finish out this series but I love this show so much I'm thrilled I can at least get PAL editions. Yes, you'll see bad feedback because people don't read before buying, but get a region-free DVD player (inexpensive) and you're in like Flint.

The picture looks great for a 25+ year old show and the packaging is sturdy. Highly recommended.  :)",1464220800,,384,4.550724637681159
8517824,4,B007IT89EK,Video and audio quality are excellent!  Be advised this DVD WILL NOT play on most players sold in North America since it is region 2.  It does play fine on my computer DVD drive however.,1461542400,3,186,4.285714285714286
