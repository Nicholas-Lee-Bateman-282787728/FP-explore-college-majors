May be worth 45 minutes of someone's time, for the scenery if nothing else.  3 / 5",1525996800,,250,4.790697674418604

8659806,3,B00KLMC6BS,"I'm half Norwegian, and I'm interested in documentaries about the country, but this was a snooze fest. For all its framing of ""a search for what home means,"" this was a series of banal interviews with ordinary people doing ordinary things and scenes of daily life.

By the way, Hammarfest is not the world's northernmost city, as the film claims. It's only the northernmost city with a population over 10,000. Longyearbyen, on the island of Svalbard, is much farther north.",1484265600,7,473,4.9125
