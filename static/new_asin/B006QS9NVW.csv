5013565,5,B006QS9NVW,"Nine Things about the Movie ""General Orders No. 9""

1. This mysterious, beautiful film is literally unlike anything I've ever seen before.

2. Full of ambiguous, almost archetypal images, it seems to have about as many interpretations as viewers. This guarantees that some people will find the movie boring.

3. It starts out like an experimental documentary about Georgia. But it's not.

4. Then it seems like one of those ""people are bad, nature is good"" statements. But it's not.

5. It's a poem about change.

6. It's a meditation on the order of things.

7. It's a prayer of a broken person.

8. It's a bitter acknowledgment of loss.

9. It's a surrender.",1390435200,3,660,4.719298245614035
5013566,4,B006QS9NVW,"This movie was made over many years as a labor of love and is an examination of the way that people have changed the environment and the way that we look at it; this doesn't necesarrily mean its for ""tree-huggers"", just that it literally examines the way that we look at our home(s).  This has a very slow burn pace that you have to surrender to (there are almost no shots with people at all) and just soak it in, I've watched it three times now and each time I notice something more.  People that are fans of the Qatsi Trilogy and specifically 'Koyaanisqatsi' will feel right at home with this film.",1360022400,5,600,4.348214285714286
5013567,1,B006QS9NVW,Please save your time and do not watch this movie! The director uses the same images over and over again without any specific plot. It is an artistic movie to some degree... The director is trying too hard and does not succeed in captivating any sort of audience.,1356048000,,263,4.5
5013568,4,B006QS9NVW,"Another reviewer referred to this movie as the ""worst I have ever seen."" It is easy to understand where such a sentiment could come from, because this film is an cinematographic and artistic trip down a very strange rabbit hole. I spent much of the movie wondering exactly what the creator of this film was trying to say. It seems to be an artistic menagerie of odd images and almost subliminally delivered images or impressions, about the evolution and de-evolution of the state of Georgia and by extension modern society as well. If the message is dark and foreboding, it is so at the subconscious level. I read once that when Charlton Heston came out of the theater after watching the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey he said to his friends ""Can anybody tell me what the hell I just watched and what it means?"" Probably most people will have a similar reaction to this film, but if you go into the movie for the experience rather than for the specifics, it is a film well worth watching.",1350518400,3,985,4.53932584269663

5013570,1,B006QS9NVW,Kept watching just to see if it ever got better.....it didn't. Worst waste of an hour and a half I've ever used.,1348358400,,112,4.136363636363637
5013571,2,B006QS9NVW,"First of all, despite what many descriptions of this film have stated, this is not a documentary. It might be more accurately described as art on film, and I mean that not as a value judgement but as a statement about it's form. The best that I can say for it is that it's very well shot, with plenty of beautiful, haunting imagery that occasionally merges well with the prose spoken intermittently throughout. That said, this film just didn't work for me at all.

Initially, the meditative pacing was intriguing but it soon became apparent that any development or message was going to be entirely subjective. Sparse poetry weaves in and out of a sequence of scenes of Georgian wilderness. Many lines and images are repeated multiple times, much to the detriment of an already torpid progression. I am not averse to plodding films, indeed many of my favorites are very slow burners but ten minutes of this felt like half an hour. The only audience I can imagine being engaged by it would be heavily narcotized film students. Whether you appreciate, worship, ignore or despise the film's kind of naturalism is a personal inclination but I can't imagine anyone feeling that the film challenged their preconceptions.

Just as I had assumed we were stuck in an infinite loop, the film finally switches gears. We move from the tranquil images of wooded Georgia to the darker side of modernity. The poetry becomes dismal and repulsed while we watch montages of vacant concrete lots, traffic clogged interstates and other scenes of urban decay. Any actual people inhabiting these post apocalyptic looking scenes are never shown, making them appear even more eerie and forlorn. Now we're in familiar territory, but the problem is that despite certain features being a bit too obvious, the message still feels very much obscured. Often deliberately so, as opportunity after opportunity to specify or elaborate is passed by for more vague contrasts between the vibrant pre-industrial south and the despicable ruin of urban society.

The most maddening thing was that, interspersed with the countless forestry scenes were odd, subtle little details that suggested that the film maker actually did have more to say, though perhaps just nothing he was comfortable making explicit. The title ""General Orders No. 9"" refers to Robert E. Lee's order of surrender at the end of the Civil War, to which there are other vague references throughout the film. The shots of rusty CW memorabilia are nearly the only man made artifacts shown in the nature worship portion of the film( as if these artifacts don't represent the same trajectory toward industrialization that the film disparages). If not for the title I might have thought those shots were just rustic imagery, but the decision of the title causes me to reconsider. Exactly what is being suggested by choosing a title based on the order surrendering the south, in the context of a film about the desecration of the natural south by society in the modern period? What connection does the film maker see between these things? I'd be very interested to know, but the film maker, Robert Persons, is as vague in interviews about the film as he is in the film. He says he wanted the title to be something largely unknown but he's never clear on why the specific choice was made, other than that he ""liked the way it looked typographically"".

The disappointing thing is that the project had such potential, in it's delineated presentation and knack for creating ambiance.  It's just that all of this ambiguity just feels like a cop out to me. Not because uncertainty wouldn't be an understandable response to modern industrial society, but because it's feigned ambiguity.  After watching it I don't believe for a second that the film maker doesn't have an opinion.  He either couldn't figure out how to express it successfully in the film or he was too afraid to.  The only thing willingly made clear was that the older and more natural is preferable to the modern and more artificial, a notion you'll have been bludgeoned with by the time the film ends at a wholly unnecessary 72 minutes.  While I certainly have sympathy for that perspective, real life is more complicated and this film avoids dealing with that complexity at every turn.",1343347200,2,4271,4.904432132963989
5013572,5,B006QS9NVW,"This film is a beautifully shot film on the changing of the South - the change from deer trail, to indian trail, to county road (in the words of the film) and how the interstate has changed our connection to the land. The film played at many excellent film festivals in the US and did a brief theatrical run. I can't wait to buy the Blu-Ray, which is a must as the film won many cinematography awards. It was rated in the top 5 docs of the year by Paste Magazine and many art/indie film centric blogs and publications.",1325635200,9,518,4.242424242424242
8503171,1,B006QS9NVW,"I can't believe I watched it through. I was hoping it would get better, but the video kept showing the same clips throughout. The voicing is unprofessional, too, and it easyly gives away this amateurish and tasteless ""art""",1501459200,,222,4.868421052631579

This documentary makes our state look like a depressing post-apocalyptic nightmare.

8503173,5,B006QS9NVW,This is a poetic film of great depth and intensity of vision. Definitely not for the rabble.,1480204800,3,92,4.470588235294118
8503174,3,B006QS9NVW,I felt like I was being brainwashed in some of the sequences and overall it was like watching my grandfathers old slideshows. I thought some of the photos were interesting but there was little explanation to go along with the individual shots.,1475884800,3,243,4.809523809523809

8503179,5,B006QS9NVW,"This is a strange and visually beautiful film with a real message thats only remotely connected to the one it seems to be relaying on the surface. At first glance it appears to be just another complaint about civilization or urbanization, or even some kind of nostalgic homage to the imaginary ol South  or the fantasy early Americana of the yeoman farmer. If that were the case, you could write it off as a clich, but based on the weirdness of this project, I doubt thats likely. This is something else. This seems to be about the human obsession with imposing order on chaos  a very primitive geometrical obsession below the level of aesthetics that has something to do with fear of death (note the frequent scenes of old cemeteries) - an obsession that never QUITE succeeds, perhaps because of the impermanence of life. Check out how in this film the attempt to assign something as the center of things (the weathervane) becomes undermined by the wider grid created by the interstate, which is itself a kind of geometry. While this has been compared to the Qatsi series and by one professional critic to the Terrence Mallick film Tree of Life, there are some strange echoes of the Cremaster cycle (yep, I do believe so) and Shane Carruths Upstream Color.",1402963200,6,1257,4.709090909090909
