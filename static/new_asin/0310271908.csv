1868,1,0310271908,"I really had to hunt to get all these, but I am seriously disappointed for 2 reasons. First, the presenter. Oh dear. OH DEAR. I am sure he's a great guy and all, but a presenter fit for filming he simply is not. His attempts to appear spontaneous and unscripted make him look VERY silly. VERY SILLY. You can see straight through it as clear as day. This ties in with the cinematography. Each presenter is teaching an invisible person. The camera angles follow the person if they are walking, or still, slightly to the side of the person. But where is the person the presenter is talking to? Oh my gosh. EYE CONTACT. They never eyeball the camera. It makes you feel very weird. I have never seen anything filmed like this. So the whole entire time you're watching you just want to see who the HECK are you talking to? but you never see, because there isn't anyone, and it is insanely frustrating. So it's like the presenters are talking to you, but they NEVER look at you. Argh. It's an exercise in patience as it just makes you want to slap the guy and say, ""HEY, I'm over HERE, LOOK at me"". The way I am expressing it, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but watch it and you'll find out. Imagine watching Katie Kuric on the evening news, but she's looking to the diagonal all the time, never at you, you'd want to slap the TV.

Another problem is the continual stop-start nature of the teachings. Every few minutes you need to hit play to keep going.

My second serious gripe is the way they have encoded the DVD. Clearly the DVD producer didn't know how to create scripts in the project because every chapter has been saved as a title. This means ripping the DVD to watch on your AppleTV or iPod, computer etc is impossible. To some this will not matter, but for me it's a big issue.

I am sure the teaching is great, if only I could stand to watch it, which I just can't. I have tried several times over the last few months and it's just frustrating. Overall it's an incredibly amateurish project totally out of character for something with Zondervan's name on it. This is why it simply must have a 1 star rating.",1191369600,3,2115,4.335858585858586

1870,4,0310271908,Great interesting teaching but it's to get past the camera work.  I used it in midweek services and got complaints every single week.,1406246400,,133,4.782608695652174
1871,4,0310271908,"First of all, there is the historical background (filmed from the Holy Land) informing the viewer of why Jesus would use a particular Parable and what it would have meant to His audience.  Then, each session has a different, respectable authority describing what the meaning of  Jesus' parable could have.
For our small group who has a myriad of Bible Studies between us, this has proven informative and interesting.  While a bit awkward at first with all the stops and starts, once everyone became used to the format, all went smoothly.
A good recommendation from us for anyone who either is just beginning to study the Word or anyone who is well versed in it.",1394409600,3,661,4.730434782608696

1876,5,0310271908,"This is an exceptional series.  Kudos to Zondervan and Matt Williams.

We selected this series for our new small group.  My wife and I have been involved in multiple small groups for the past thirty years.  I have often found small group material shallow and unchallenging.  Everyone in our group finds this series exceptional on multiple levels.  First, the quality of the material is superb because each lesson is taught by seminary professor who is speaking in his area of expertise.  Second, the format of splitting each video lesson into three parts is very effective.  I was weary of this before we started, wondering how it would logistically work in the group, and how the whole thing would flow.  However, we have found that it works very well, allowing you to discuss the points of each sub-teaching before going on to the next section that builds upon the prior one: Historical context, deeper dive into the meaning, and application.  You just have to be disciplined to keep on schedule.  Third, the personal application (focus of the third video section) and the attending questions are focused, deep, and easily personalized.  Fourth, I have found powerful little nuggets of truth in text boxes inserted in the study guide of each lesson.

We relocated to South Carolina in May 2012 and we're new to the church we're attending.  I have to say, this new small group is the deepest, most mature small group we have ever been a part of as a couple.  Although our group is very mature, I don't at all think this material is only suitable for more mature, deeply committed followers of Jesus.  Its value is not that it is intellectually deep and challenging, but rather that its deep insights are so well developed, well presented, and easily understood.  I think this material will be equally beneficial to anyone willing to sit and participate - from questioning seekers to mature followers of Jesus.

To A.I. who tossed out the entire series based on dislike for the directors decision to have the speakers not look into the camera as they presented: an epic tossing of the baby with the bath water.

Our group has decided to continue with the Deeper Connection series after this one.",1362268800,3,2195,4.8053333333333335
1877,2,0310271908,Information was good but had trouble when none of the speakers ever looked at the cameras.  The outlines were a little hard to follow. The work book follows the video well but just to much to follow at times.,1359504000,2,208,4.333333333333333
1878,4,0310271908,"Used this DVD as a supplement to class I led using William Barclay's excellent book ""The Parables of Jesus"".  Class thought the presentations were interesting and added to our understanding of the parables.",1354665600,,206,5.242424242424242
1879,5,0310271908,"I haven't watched this DVD but have been checking them out for potential purchase. The Zondervan website shows several DVDs in the series: The Parables of Jesus; The Life of Jesus; The Miracles of Jesus; The Prayers of Jesus; The Forgiveness of Jesus; The Last Days of Jesus. Also, I cant find in any of the reviews the length of time in minutes of the videos; the Zondervan website says: three hours of teaching per DVD by Bible professors who know how to communicate the world of the biblical text to today's world. I hope this helps someone.",1348272000,,544,4.561224489795919
1880,5,0310271908,These books arrived in 24 hours and were in perfect conditions.  I couldn't ask for anything else.  We purchased these books for a study group so researched the content in advance.  Amazon provided the best price and service.,1347667200,,225,4.868421052631579
1881,5,0310271908,"I purchased the whole ""Deeper Connection"" series DVD and supporting books for a small non-denominational church's bible-study.  We have only one bible study for all ages.  We viewed the DVD lessons and then I used the book to facilitate discussions.  I found many of the insights presented in the series deepening my faith and I could see it benefiting the others in this group.  This is excellent in the way it presents information, the quality of the information, and for the most part it does not contradict any particular denomination's faith.  It stays with the fundamental truths that are the Christian truths.

I highly recommend all the DVDs in this series for group and even individual study.  I would buy more if Matt Williams would continue to make more in this series.",1347580800,,780,4.863636363636363

1884,5,0310271908,This has been excellent material for a small group Bible Study. Prep is drop-dead simple. The quality of the video content is outstanding. I plan to use other DVD's in this series in the future.,1278979200,,194,4.571428571428571
1885,4,0310271908,"I just concluded my church small group using this video/book and both my class members and myself thought this was very well done.  I advised my group of the quirkiness based on other Amazon reviews, but that didn't dampen my group's response to the videos.  Each of us thought they were well done and very infomrative.  We all agreed some were better presented than others, videos number 2 and 6 stand out as being quite exceptional, but overall every one of the segments had merit.

The viewer must get used to the format.  Each videos starts out with the host appearing soewhere in the holy land.  Then they transition to a biblical scholar based somewhere in the US.  The host only appears for a couple of minutes at the start of each lesson then plasy no further role.  Once we break away from the host, theme music runs again as if we're beginning something new.  After the second set of theme music the video will cite the Biblical reference then transition to the presenter.  While this all seems a bit odd, it really doesn't detract from the overall presentation.

I recommend this for any Bible study class.  My church offered this as an adult education opportunity but now I've learned it is considering other uses.  I do believe this has many options for general church education.  Once my class ended, people were left wanting more.  Since there are many more parables to consider, perhaps a volume two will be forthcoming.",1260403200,3,1436,4.688
1886,5,0310271908,"I have gone through this study twice with two different groups. It's a wonderful study that truly brings Jesus words to life! Each session is full of indepth details regarding the culture and expectations of Jewish life in Jesus' day. Not only do the professors provide valuable insight into the specific parables, but they provide necessary application for our daily walk with God. This study is definitely enlightening and well worth your time.",1227657600,4,446,5.123287671232877
1887,5,0310271908,"The three-volume Deeper Connections series produced by Zondervan is unique. Unlike any other Bible study available, this visually stunning DVD series is taught and written by biblical experts - six professors with specialized areas of knowledge. The three volumes in this study series are :

1.  The Parables of Jesus
2.  The Prayers of Jesus
3.  Miracles of Jesus

The Teachers featured on the series are : Dr. Gary Burge, Wheaton College; Dr. David Garland, Truett Theological Seminary; Dr. Mark Strauss, Bethel Seminary; Dr. Michael Wilkins, Talbot School of Theology; Dr. Matt Williams, Biola University; Dr. Ben Witherington III, Asbury Theological Seminary.

Hosted by Jarrett Stevens and filmed in locations as diverse as Gloucester harbor, the Holy Land, Boston's Old North Church, and Chicago's lakefront, each volume consists of six fascinating sessions. Each session is taught by a different instructor and consists of three components:

1. Historical and cultural background
2. An engaging, close look at the biblical text and its meaning
3. Accurate, encouraging, and challenging applications of the Bible's message to life today

Each volume is accompanied by a Participant Guide which is available separately allowing participants to make deeper connections with a knowledge of historical background of the Bible, biblical text, and real life applications.

'The Parables of Jesus: Six In-depth Studies Connecting the Bible to Life' is one of the volumes of the Deeper Connections series focusing on parables of Jesus. Jesus communicated deep spiritual truths through simple, vivid, and engaging stories. Woven from the stuff of everyday life, the parables of Jesus made the kingdom of God understandable and accessible to his listeners. The study helps you gain new insights into his parables and their meanings that will help you to appreciate more fully their relevance for your own life.

Six Sessions included on this DVD are:

The Coming of the Kingdom
The Grace of the Kingdom
The God of the Kingdom
The Demand of the Kingdom
The Mission of the Kingdom
The Fulfillment of the Kingdom

Highly recommended for all students of the bible!",1214352000,12,2156,5.3088235294117645
1888,5,0310271908,"I am glad I happened to come across IA's review shortly after it was posted.  IA's review is not only unacceptable but incomplete.  If you're looking for one opinion about the dvd format and production, he/she may be of help.  However, he/she even states ""I am sure the teaching is great, if only I could stand to watch it"" which implies that the review has nothing to do with the (outstanding) teaching but his/her opinions of camera angles and eye contact.  Allow me to briefly introduce you to the actual content - the main reason why people buy Bible studies like Deeper Connections.

Unlike IA's experience, my small group and I thoroughly enjoyed and benefited from this Bible study.  The guide (or presenter) is actually over in Israel as he introduces each teaching, thus helping bring the text and teachings to life.  Simply getting a glimpse of where Jesus walked, taught, etc. helped me to connect to the text in new ways.  Moreover, his presentations were not cheesy, but informative and natural.

IA may not like the lack of eye contact, but we personally thought it was insightful (plus, why give a 1/5 stars for something like that?). It felt more like the teacher was part of the small group instead of having someone talk 'at' me.  The difference with eye contact was noticeable at first, but my small group quickly and easily adjusted and it never became a problem.  Please do not write-off this Bible study series based on a poor review.  You will be missing out on quality teaching from these six professors who have a pastoral heart and a gift to communicate God's Word to His people.  Zondervan has done an excellent job (also, the Participant Guide is excellent as well).",1191456000,33,1694,4.72108843537415

Powerful, captivating, well-researched and informative, thorough and concise!  These interesting and unique materials are a great learning tool for those seeking understanding of the Scriptures.  Absolutely loved them!  Receives my highest recommendation.
Mary PetersonCounselor to Pastor of Community of Christ in Cedar Park, TX

Our adult study group (Community of Christ in Cedar Park, TX) recently finished the study of The Parables of Jesus, with Dr. Matt Williams as the general Editor.  Because of the positive response to this course of study, we wanted to continue with other books in the series.  However, efforts to find these materials were fruitless.  I contacted Dr. Matt Williams and was informed that Rose Publishing was soon to release the republication of The Miracles of Jesus, and other books in the series would soon follow.  Words cannot express our gratitude, joy and relief upon hearing this news, because we plan to study every book in the series.
The Participants Guides are well researched, historically and culturally accurate, informative and interesting.  We loved the ah ha moments when some cultural fact was presented that we weren't aware of.  The questions in the participants guides are engaging and thought provoking, leading to deeper consideration as to relevancy and applicability to this day and age.
The DVDs are Wonderful!  The scenic backgrounds help to connect visually to the times and places when Jesus walked this earth.  And the historical information that accompanies the visuals makes the experience complete.
The academic credentials and expertise of each presenter added to the fullness of our understanding and ensured an enjoyable and spiritually enlightening experience.  Our heartfelt thanks to Rose Publishing for making these powerful materials available.
