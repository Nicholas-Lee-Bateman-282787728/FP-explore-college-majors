5731854,1,B00CP4Y5PU,"Interesting subject matter, but this documentary leans on salacious clearly unsubstantiated notions about Loreta Velasquez. I'm guessing that not much is known about Velasquez, so the film-makers took the liberty of just saying ""well, maybe she did this...we don't know that she didn't."" It's cliched and insulting.",1449187200,7,315,5.723404255319149

5731861,5,B00CP4Y5PU,"This is a fascinating and very impacting documentary about the life of Loreta Janeta Velazquez, a Cuban lady who disguised herself as a man and fought for the Confederacy during the War Between The States.  She eventually wrote a memoir about her experiences that was controversial because she actually revealed what the horrors of camp life and war life were like. The documentary is so well done that it almost has a feature film effect to it, as one actually feels the suffering along with Loreta when her family is hit by tragedy.  The documentary dwells some on the Latino versus White experience quite a bit.  Although,  it seems almost like it wasn't really an issue with Loreta.  However, it is interesting, that when she disguised herself and later became a spy, she used very anglicized names in both contexts.  I feel inspired to read Loreta's memoir after seeing this documentary, it is that well made.",1420416000,2,914,4.826923076923077

5731867,4,B00CP4Y5PU,"I love the way this documentary was done/filmed. It's not just historians nattering away about what they read/know, with a few old photos shown here and there. It's a mixture of a woman's narrative, narrating parts from Loretta's autobiography, The Woman in  Battle, and reenactments of Loretta's life from childhood to marriage to motherhood to war.
With, of course, the occasional historian and photo appropriate to the time period. There's only one known photograph of Loretta herself and even that is in doubt.

Don't know who I'm talking about? I'll tell ya the gist of it. Loretta Janeta Velazquez was born into a wealthy Cuban family and sent to the States to become a proper lady. Instead of becoming a proper lady, Loretta married a man her family didn't approve of (her best friend's boyfriend), and upon being widowed and losing her two daughters (a third stillborn), she cut off all her hair, donned her dead husband's uniform, and fought for the Confederacy, as a man.

What's strange to me, however, and sadly not explained in this documentary--it's said the reasons for her actions were not made clear--is why was a Cuban woman who wasn't even really accepted as a Southern lady, fighting to enslave others?

Though the well-to-do white Cubans did their share of slave owning, not unlike Puerto Rico. And much ado was made about how ""white"" or how ""colored"" a person of Latin descent was. Ladies in society even went so far as to pay a lot of money to prove their ancestry was ""untouched"" by those of darker complexions.

And the documentary does state that the city of New Orleans, where she spent her growing-up years sided with the South even though they weren't slave owners.

Even crazier, in order to be accepted by the white slave owners she was fighting alongside, Loretta bought a slave of her own--Bob. She had to enslave another, in order to explore her own freedom.

There are a lot of things about Loretta that seem contradictory. She's a hard one to figure out. But one thing is for certain: she's a fascinating woman in history who did some brave things, from fighting in the battle of Bull Run to publishing her memoirs at the risk of being publicly declared a fraud to helping with the Cuban Revolution. Did I mention she defected to the North? That put her back in my good graces. LOL

She was even wounded four times, hiding the wounds and averting treatment, in order to hide her sex. She did this until caught in 1863, when she was forced to go from soldier to spy and then became a double agent, having had her eyes open to war and what was really going on behind the battle lines.

A great documentary about an interesting woman. I do wish it had been longer. It's a mere hour, though an intriguing one.",1400889600,3,2741,4.646694214876033
5731868,5,B00CP4Y5PU,"I had to research movies for our One Book One Community program hosted by the Friends of the Library.  I came across ""Rebel"" while tooling around on the Net, and found it to be a well put together documentary about Loreta Janeta Velazquez.  She was a wife, a mother, a Civil War soldier, and a spy.  She was not just a female soldier, she was a soldier, period.  She went through all the hardships of any soldier in the Civil War. Personally, I think she popped her cork, but hers is a very compelling story.",1400198400,3,508,4.315789473684211
5731869,5,B00CP4Y5PU,"I was looking for a film which depicted a strong Latina in a positive leadership role based on real life. This film was the first one I found, and it was intriguing. I wish it would have been a bit longer.",1399075200,,205,4.024390243902439
5731870,5,B00CP4Y5PU,"I saw this documentary on PBS one night and thought it was amazing. I read about women serving as soldiers in the Civil War, however to see and hear their story in excellent. I will purchase the books as soon as I can. Great documentary and highly recommended. These women and their families went through so much during the war. Just as they do today.",1396828800,,351,4.415384615384616
5731871,5,B00CP4Y5PU,This movie is a must see for those interested in women in history and the Latina experience. The movie is both a reenactment of Loretta's life in Cuba and New Orleans (along with locations in the Civil War) and also has experts providing their opinions of historic facts of her life as well as the times. It's an appropriate film for people of all ages.,1381104000,6,353,4.446153846153846
5731872,5,B00CP4Y5PU,"ReBel is a fascinating and provocative feature documentary about Loreta Janeta Velazquez, Civil War soldier and spy.  She cross-dressed and fought for the Confederacy.

8584313,5,B00CP4Y5PU,"Great historic documentary about woman's roles in the American Civil War and one woman's account about the horrible pain and destruction that was inflicted on Americans in both the North and South as well as the destruction to the land and  its people's. Loreta Velazquez tells the story about how some profited from the war while many people suffered incredible pain and loss. She discredits the idea of a romantic heroic war and instead tells about the horrors that she witnessed and encountered while fighting as a disguised male for the Confederate side as well as a female spy. Lortea, as well as about 1000 other woman, went into battle to fight for their beliefs disguised as men. These woman saw first hand the horrors of war and felt a great commitment to their efforts like their fellow male soldiers. Great PBS presentation.",1528070400,,835,4.839160839160839

8584315,5,B00CP4Y5PU,"A story of a courageous woman during an important time in history. It is upsetting that the general called her book a hoax, but that's what the establishment always does when people try to get the truth out to the world. Any time, you hear the word ""hoax"" or ""conspiracy theory"" it's very likely they are trying to cover up the truth.",1526342400,,334,4.403225806451613

8584317,4,B00CP4Y5PU,"Lots on Civil War female spies in the Smithsonian, great to be able to spend time in just one of their stories.  The south was full of nationals from ""south of the border"" and the Caribbean at that time, some with European Spanish blood, many of whom had lived on what is now American soil for many generations.  Very interesting story which takes into account that while not all of it can be proven (much is from the book she wrote), much of it can be corroborated from public record.  Thanks, PBS!",1519689600,2,499,4.4021739130434785

8584320,1,B00CP4Y5PU,"It is a crying shame that liberals can completely ruin what of would of been a GREAT story line. People, if you want to tell a story, then tell the story and stop being so condescending with the narrative. Besides, maybe the South you speak about is not the real South! Have you ever thought about that, or did your education made you prejudice?!
