8594620,4,B00DMYD486,"I know the lead actress, Kechun Li, who rewrote the script for the director while in Prague.  She is beautiful and talented -- which is obvious if you watch the movie.  Those of us who travel around the world bring our own personal histories and expectation from our experiences within our own culture with us -- including problems finding interesting and prospective romantic partners from our country of origin or another country.  Prague is a beautiful location for a dramatic examination of Chinese living in a Western society.

The movie does not define a Chinese romance, but illustrates universal problems with credibility/sincerity, inadequate employment and income, romantic fraud, etc.  Does not come with subtitles, if I remember correctly.

Kechun Li's performance is worth the price of the DVD.  She received two nominations for China's Academy Awards (not for this picture though) and other popular and professional recognition throughout her career.  There should be more of her movies available on DVD.",1378684800,,1018,5.31875
