8469716,5,B005F96UOG,"The Kirkwood colony is in Nerval's literal clutches. The students of Surre Academy are trapped in their classrooms. Akiha and her friends are stuck on Earth. And Nami, aided and abetted by Aleida, has completely given in to her own darkness.
  Yes, in the third volume of ""Sorakake,"" the tone is becoming more serious than ever. Even the opening and closing songs reflect this--instead of the playful invitations to fun and adventure, we now hear encouragements to persevere and be strong (opening) and a rather sad sigh of loneliness and estrangement (closing).
  But there is plenty of courage as well.  The students of Surre's Level Free (whom I'd always considered snobbish) risk their lives to escape the colony and get to the Kirkwood refugees to warn them of Nerval's activities, while Akiha and the others end up in orbit around Jupiter, where Sakura's wavy scarf and hat turn out to have been a sleeping alien who leads them to an important discovery.  And as for humor...well, watch what happens when Itsuki re-tells her back story to Boo and Min, and listen to Ul berating his home-guard militia when they run away from their first battle!
  All in all, this vid is a great continuation of the story, and also the one with the most harrowing cliffhanger; so if you're buying this one, you may want to go ahead and get Volume 4 as well.  Enjoy!",1368576000,,1354,4.727659574468085
