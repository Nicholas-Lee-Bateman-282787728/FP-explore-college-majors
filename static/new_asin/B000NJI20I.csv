2769353,5,B000NJI20I,"worth to watch and re-watch
video editing is poor - looks like high school kid was playing with video effects, but the content is superb, skim over the talking about personalities and watch the riding and comments on riding - you will enjoy it  5+",1210291200,3,247,4.488888888888889
2769354,2,B000NJI20I,I'm tolerant with someone tooting their horn for a few minutes -- but not for half the video.  There are some skills to learn between sponsor moments and the yak yak yak about Shane -- but no switch-back riding skill which I was most hoping to improve.  This video is worth something less than half the price.  The best and surprising feature about the video is the quality of the production -- it isn't like amateur video riding found on YouTube.,1206489600,,447,4.493827160493828
8178167,5,B000NJI20I,"Shane's vids are so full of info that you have to watch them several times and repeat. To a real beginner much of the instruction will go in one ear and out the other. It really is in depth if you are able to extract all the info and actually put it into action. Sounds like the folks that are complaining about the ads and ego don't have a real appreciation or understanding of real off-road riding or the techniques and practice it takes. I've been watching these vids for the past couple of years off and on and every time I pick up or actually understand something new. I've also been to two of his off road riding schools and I'm a much better rider having watch and rode with watts. That's all folk, from here in Oregon!",1452988800,,726,4.23021582733813
8178168,2,B000NJI20I,Looking for help as a beginning rider! Go ride with experienced friend willing to help teach. Shane Watts is a great rider and you get to hear all about!,1422835200,,153,4.310344827586207
8178169,5,B000NJI20I,very good,1413417600,,9,4.0
8178170,3,B000NJI20I,"too much yip yap and not enough actual instructions.  i've heard the other DVD's in the series are better, maybe i should have bought volume 1 instead.",1383609600,,151,4.592592592592593
8178171,3,B000NJI20I,"There are some good tips but not enough detail for me personally.  Also, as others mentioned, it's a Wattsy/KTM advert/promo, which I don't mind, but it overpowers the learning portion.  I believe that a better ""how to"" video is out there, somewhere.",1375660800,,250,4.928571428571429
8178172,3,B000NJI20I,thiugh I like hearing about Shane*s wins the presentation was putting me to slip. I was expecting to see more riding and less talking - less boring interviews.,1373414400,,159,4.714285714285714
8178173,5,B000NJI20I,Shane shows you some of the basic techniques and some great practice exercised. All 3 videos are very good. I cant wait until Volumes #3 and #4 are released!,1328572800,,157,4.448275862068965
8178174,3,B000NJI20I,"A bit salesy and egocentric, but if you can get by that, I enjoyed his riding tips.  I'm a novice woods rider just looking for tips on how to handle the woods more efficiently.  Not sure if this DVD would help a woods racer.  For $25 it's worth the look.",1291161600,2,254,4.04
8178175,5,B000NJI20I,"This is an excellent video for all off road riders, especially beginners wanting to know the finer points of bike control. I continue to watch it and work on each point, ""bike control and posture"". A great investment for those wanting to know how to handle their bike.",1222560000,5,268,4.604166666666667
8178176,3,B000NJI20I,"Well ... it's no secret that Shane is a hell of a rider but the video seems to feel that maybe the public could use more reminders. While there is a lot of good tips in there the majority of the conversation is about Shane Watts (Watsy!). It's kind of confusing at times as to the nature of the DVD - Shane Watts for president or Shane Watts teaches you Enduro tips.

But ... all of that aside ... when you get to the tips they are concrete. Shane is a great rider and the DVD does try to pass along some good notes on his particular strategies and practices. A lot in there but also some good points left out.

The DVD production is a bit amateurish, but I can live with that.

Not completely disappointed with it but would only recommend with a warning on the self promotion aspect.",1220832000,,784,4.178807947019868
