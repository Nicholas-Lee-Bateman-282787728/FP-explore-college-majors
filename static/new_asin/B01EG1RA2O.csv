7734642,5,B01EG1RA2O,Can't believe these magnificent animals have returned to the wild! It's a must watch...super cool shots of the mountains too.,1465257600,,125,5.3
8758446,4,B01EG1RA2O,"Wow, what a great documentary! We learned so much and to see these majestic animals roaming wild and free was spectacular. Great job!",1531526400,,133,4.826086956521739
8758447,5,B01EG1RA2O,It was a birthday gift for my husband. He really likes it. It came in good time and was well packaged. Thank you.,1493510400,,113,3.9565217391304346
8758448,1,B01EG1RA2O,"hilarious. these two tool bags never hike but the same, marked crummy trail on a baby mountain living out a childish fantasy of a poser bowhunter/filmmaker . the lack of knowledge of backpacking, hunting and film making is comical. absolute rubbish. ""4 thousand feet of elevation""  ""the elements""  ""trained in the gym for 2 months""",1491350400,,331,5.0
8758449,4,B01EG1RA2O,"Interesting study of the descendants of Spanish fighting bulls establishing themselves in the mountains of northern Mexico. Off the beaten track, for sure. Eddie Brochin is a hunting and fishing guide and game management consultant--but no animals are harmed in the making of this film! What starts as a bow-hunt becomes a study of habitat and adaptation.",1484524800,,355,5.245614035087719
8758450,5,B01EG1RA2O,"It's no wonder that Spirit of the Bull won so many awards. The whole family enjoyed this documentary film, we couldn't stop watching it. It took us to another place and time.  It is full of priceless interviews and images. The filming, and the music were wonderful, very well done. In this world of instant , easy everything, and fast moving empty entertainment this was very refreshing and inspiring! Much thanks to the makers for sharing their passion.",1482969600,2,454,4.82051282051282

8758452,1,B01EG1RA2O,Some sadistic bow and arrow hunter chasing down harmless bulls. Crap!,1475539200,,69,5.363636363636363
8758453,1,B01EG1RA2O,"While the idea of the majestic fighting bulls having become wild and a few of the shots were amazing, the writing, narration and ""performances"" we're dull and somewhat irritating. I found myself fast forwarding a lot. There were also sound quality issues for several interviews where I had to turn the captioning on.",1471132800,,316,4.981132075471698
8758454,5,B01EG1RA2O,Muy interesante!!!,1466899200,,18,8.5
8758455,5,B01EG1RA2O,"Many men hunt for legends, they may spend their lives looking to prove that they exist. In this movie master outdoorsman Eddie Brochin finds his in short order. Great show, I really enjoyed it. Great job Eddie maybe you should head out after Bigfoot next !!!",1465430400,,258,4.630434782608695
