3067384,2,B0011N19HI,"I'm being generous in giving this dvd a 2 star.  I loved the first 4 seasons and found myself truly laughing.  To my GREAT disappointment Rhoda is not in this season.  She was the glue that held Mary's sugary character, Phylis's flighty character, and Georgette's incredibly simple character together.  In all that mush there had to be somebody with backbone and a clear head.  Rhoda was so enjoyable to watch and was the perfect backdrop for Mary's otherwise spineless character.  I know millions love MTM, and in my own way I do to; but sadly she cannot hold this show alone.  Trying to replace Rhoda as her close friend with Georgette and Phylis is at once nauseating and painful to watch.  I loved all these characters in their lesser roles but shoving them to the glaring front to fill the gaping hole left by Rhoda gags me.  On top of that, Mary looks older, is more boring and what you kind of affectionately loved at thirty doesn't wear as well when reaching middle age.  I would expect a 40 year old to show a little more strength.  Plus she seems bored and unenthusiastic wih her role.  To make up for the lacking the writers thought it necessary to load the scripts with sexual inuendos----a sure sign they're struggling to write quality stuff.  The first 4 seasons stood on their own.  As Red Skelton once said, ""If the actors and writing have any talent they don't need to resort to sex.""  As I sat without so much as a smile wading through the first disc, I found myself constantly missing Rhoda----hoping  and hoping she'd make even a quick appearance.  What a shame.  I have 3 more of these dvd's coming and will probably ship them right back if this season 5 doesn't get better.  I'll try the Rhoda set.....she can carry her own show alone.",1422662400,,1757,4.538216560509555

I like the slip cased packaging the first four had, because it contained a very helpful booklet, and a very nice way to have all the shows grouped, by having a snap case for S1-Episode 1-8, in one case, and so on.
The shows are priceless, the quality of full screen does not excite me, but still, the content is pure fun. Worth the price of admission.",1397433600,,572,4.256880733944954

3067461,3,B0011N19HI,"'The Mary Tyler Moore Show,' which ran for seven seasons between 1970 and 1977, was, with 'All in the Family' (1971-1979), 'The Bob Newhart Show'  (1972-1978), 'Maude'  (1972-1978), and 'M*A*S*H' (1972-1983), one of the premier American television comedies of its era. The program also had one of the most talented casts ever gathered for a television comedy, the very model of ensemble comedic acting.

As the 1970s dawned, seemingly overnight, the mannered and fanciful comedies of the 1960s, like 'The Beverly Hillbillies' (1962-1971), 'Bewitched' (1964-1972) and 'Mayberry R.F.D.' (1968-1971) were gone. 'Supernatural,' 'rural,' sentimental, and 'Middle Class WASP' comedies were, thanks largely to Norman Lear, suddenly considered pass&eacute;, and were replaced by comedies of 'social realism,' and, in fact, 'realism' of all kinds: early episodes of 'Maude' had a guest asking to borrow a feminine sanitary napkin and Maude herself having an abortion, while Archie Bunker, on 'All in the Family,' routinely flushed American television's first audible, but visually offscreen, toilet.

'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' also offered its viewing audience its share of social precedents: without pushing the envelope too aggressively, the show recognized gay, Jewish, and Black minorities, and suggested the new 'informed' approach the American public should take to then-controversial issues like feminism, premarital sex, sex education for children, anti-Semitism, and even the then-unlikely situation comedy theme of addiction to prescription drugs.

'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' also courted sympathy from audiences by giving Moore's initially perky, charming, and kind-hearted character, unmarried associate television producer Mary Richards, her share of life's miseries, including bad dates, failed parties, exploitive acquaintances, untimely bouts of influenza, and, famously, an inexplicable 'hair bump.'

The problem with Season Five is that the lovable, warm, and generous Mary Richards of the first four seasons is almost nowhere in evidence; the show's producers may have always planned for Mary to evolve beyond the ingenue of the initial seasons, but by Season Five, Richards is inexplicably portrayed as continuously sour, peevish, strident, and markedly less tolerant of others and their behavior.

In fact, in Season Five, the Richards character often comes across as almost unlikable; whether this was the producer's decision or at least partially Moore's choice, via her interpretation of the role, is unknown. Perhaps Moore developed personal problems which spilled over into her performance, or there were overt creative problems with the production itself. Regardless, the Mary Richards of Season Five barely resembles the bubbly, optimistic woman with the long dark hair of the first two seasons.

What, if anything, did this hardened depiction of Mary Richards say about the 'New Woman,' the single 'career woman' of the era?

Since the Mary Richards character is promoted from associate producer to producer of the evening WJM news about the same that her personality conspicuously changes, one logical interpretation of Season Five is that ""for a woman, professional success is no substitute for a happy marriage and a family of one's own,"" the same social model and hard-pressed message offered in 'The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet' (1952-1966), 'Father Knows Best' (1954-1960), and 'Leave It to Beaver' (1957-1963). It's impossible to believe, however, that this is the message the producers consciously intended to promote.

The producers had wedged themselves into a tough, if not impossible, corner: if the romantically-desirable Mary Richards finally met a suitable man and married, then the entire 'fictional unmarried career woman who has made it possible for real women to stay home alone on a Saturday night' angle would collapse, but having Mary remain single throughout her thirties despite the attentions of dozens of handsome, eligible men seemed to suggest that the 'New Woman' could not find personal and mature romantic happiness whether single or married. Mary Richards started to appear--and to act---more like an oddball than a figure to be emulated and admired.

Who the 'revised' Mary Richards does resemble is Beth Jarrett, the repressed, 'unfeeling' and emotionally clipped mother in Robert Redford's 'Ordinary People' (1980), a role also essayed by Moore in a performance which earned her an Oscar nomination.

Worse still, the show ended in 1977 with Mary Richards being fired along with almost all of the rest of the newsroom staff by the new owners of WJM, leaving Mary without a career and without a significant relationship. Thus, the character's journey through the 1970s, while conceivably 'realistic,' seems to have ended in all-around failure.

However, the entire tenor of 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' has changed for the worst in Season Five, and for other reasons beyond the interpretation of Mary Richards: hilarious multi-prismed upstairs neighbor Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) is gone, and forward-thinking, melodramatic, and obnoxious downstairs neighbor Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachmann, who, interestingly, also played Donna Stone's best friend Iris on 'The Donna Reed Show,' one of the premier American television comedies of the 1950s and 1960s) appears in only a handful of episodes.

The producers valiantly attempted to balance these losses by adding Georgia Engle to the cast as the perpetually naive Georgette Franklin, introducing the mercurial, sexually-aggressive cooking show host Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White, who had her own 1950s television comedy series, 'Life With Elizabeth,' which ran from 1952 to 1955), and, somewhat disastrously, by pushing childlike, vain, and stupid anchorman Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) forward so that he becomes a primary, rather than a secondary, character. It's simply too much Ted Baxter, and the character's overexposure dilutes Knight's former great effectiveness in the role. It's simply not believable that Ted and girlfriend Georgette turn up on Mary's doorstep almost nightly, the way Rhoda, who used to live in a converted attic above Mary's apartment, typically did.

Though Georgia Engel was a genuine find as a performer and the character of Georgette charmingly written, neither could fill, as they were expected to, the colossal shoes left behind by Rhoda Morgenstern and Valerie Harper. In the same vein, it's difficult to believe that Mary would cultivate a close friendship with predatory, treacherous Sue Ann, who publicly insults Mary to her face in one episode after another. Why would a successful 1970s 'New Woman' tolerate, even court, open hostility from a 1950s-style matron?

The evidence offered by Season Five suggests that the producers realized that the show's best days were behind them. The writing no longer had its finger on the zeitgeist the way it had in earlier seasons (with key writers like Treva Silverman no longer with the show), and while the program had initially felt organic, 'realistic,' and effortless, after Season Four, signs of strain, toil, and artifice where everywhere.

An episode in Season Six ('Mary Moves Out') was tellingly dedicated to the ""rut"" Mary finds herself in, with Rhoda married and living again in New York City, and Phyllis now living in San Francisco. The producer's answer? Have Mary Richards move from her modest but iconic rental apartment to a much larger one in tony high-rise, a decision that probably wasn't too popular with fans at the time.

When 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' went off the air in 1977, Moore has said that, as 'M*A*S*H' (1972-1983) would do later, the producers decided to end the show while it was still in relatively good form. Whether there should have been a sixth and seventh season is arguable, but 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' started to show major signs of fatigue and 'message failure' here.",1349308800,4,7909,5.452984464431725
3067462,5,B0011N19HI,"I think I've always wanted to be Mary.  I wanted to work at WJM, live in her apartment and look like her.  But there are no substitutes; Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Richards is an original.  She should be bronzed or, better yet, dipped in gold.  Besides, there's no way to follow an act who has worked her way up to producer of the news and, yet, still has enough whimsy to ask her boss to go ice-skating at lunch; someone who is fond of telling stories about being a pom-pom girl but has the wherewithal to go to jail for not revealing her source.  This is Mary, and this is how clever the character development and writing was in season five of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show.""

The 1974/75 season is smart and hilarious, but the writers weren't afraid to add little moments of wistfulness as Mary is shown missing her best friend; Valerie Harper was starring in her own MTM production, ""Rhoda.""  The moments were few, but it's palpable.  When Mary has a problem with a guy, Georgette (Georgia Engel) asks her if she misses talking to Rhoda.  Another time we see Mary, Murray (Gavin MacLeod) and Georgette returning from a shopping trip for Rhoda's wedding.  We all miss the two of them together, but our own wistfulness quickly turns to laughter as the show managed with flying colors.

In fact, they turned out some spectacular episodes this season.  Topping the list is ""Ted Baxter's Famous Broadcasters' School.""  Ted (Ted Knight) gets hooked into sponsoring said school.  When it falls apart, the outcome is one of the best scenes in sitcom history.  Guest star Leonard Frey is hilarious as the school's student.  The reactions to him from Lou (Ed Asner), Mary & Murray should be studied by actors.  Another favorite is ""The Shame of the Cities,"" where WJM does a positive documentary and the response to it leaves Mary tipsy.  She is the best at playing drunk.  ""Not a Christmas Story"" is also a favorite.  Sue Ann (Betty White) is taping her Happy Homemaker Christmas show & has Mary and the gang, who are all fighting, come to the studio for a hysterical holiday meal.  ""What Are Friends For"" has Mary and Sue Ann on a business trip together.  ""You Try to Be a Nice Guy"" features Mary helping a hooker she was in jail with.  The dress Mary wears at the end is insanely funny, but she looked fantastic.

Another great thing about this season is there seems to be more references to the time period.  There are plenty of remarks about the economy and inflation, particularly in ""Phyllis Whips Inflation,"" where Phyllis (Cloris Leachman) has to look for a job.  Super Bowl 1975 is featured in ""The System.""  The most significant is a joke about President Nixon's impeachment; this season began right after Nixon resigned in August 1974.

There are 24 great episodes with good disc quality.  No extras.  As mentioned by others, the packaging isn't the best.  I wish they had listed the episodes, but they're on the discs.

Enjoy season five.  They're so good, you'll laugh and be Mary!  Well... maybe you won't be Mary, but you'll be...merry...do you know what I mean, Mr. Grant?  Hmm...Maybe I'm a little like Mary, after all.",1333152000,,3126,4.632058287795993

3067466,3,B0011N19HI,"""THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW"" is funny.  ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" is well-written.  ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" is full of good acting, and wonderful production values.

Why then did I, (and do I still), nickname this show, ""The Mary Tyler Moore HORROR Show""?  Because Mary is a woman seemingly totally alone.  Yes, she has friends -- but where is her family?  She is dependant on the whims, likes and dislikes of her irrascible boss, ""Mr. Grant"", (Ed Asner).  Her neighbours are very weird -- especially at first.

Oh, she ""turns the world on with her smile"", all right.  She has gumtion and fortitude.  But not everyone does.  Every time I watched this show, I wished with all my heart that ""Mary Richards"" could go back to being ""Laura Petrie"" -- married, loved, and with stability in her life.  I suppose another nickname for this show could be, ""The Perils of Mary"".  And then there was the stereotype of her neighbour, the Jewish Rhoda Morganstern.  The show TRIED to be kind to Rhoda, but stereotypes she exhibited overshadowed any good points in her character.  Being Jewish myself, I literally SQUIRMED inside everytime these stereotypes showed up.  (MY idols are the young and etherea YVETTE MIMEUX, the young and ethereal CAROL LYNLEY.....QUEEN ELIZABETH II -- as a lovely young woman, and as an extremely good-looking older woman, (oh, how I'd love to know those youth-reserving royal beauty secrets!),  MIRA SORVINO, (famous for combining beauty AND brains), lovely Judy Bowker, just about every super-model that ever lived, especially at the beginning of their careers, (esoially JEAN SHRIMPTON, SUZY PARKER and CINCY CRAWFORD), and the young, smart and quite beautiful KATE
MIDDLETON!  I realize these are NOT the stereotypical idols of Jewish ladies.  But then, ALL stereotypes are stupid.  Everyone is an individual.....)

There is a rumour that a high-placed person in the George Bush II administration has ALWAYS been for ""women's lib""....but NOT because it would make more money for women.  Nope.  He was always for it so it would break up families!

It's been a long time since I saw ""The Mary Tyler Moore"" show, so I don't remember if her family was ever shown.  She just seemed in SO vulnerable a position to me.
Rhoda's stereotype also turned me off.  However funny and bright ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was, I felt a chill go up my spine, every time I watched it.

Give me, instead, ""The Waltons"", ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", ""The Donna Reed Show"",
or even ""The Trouble With Father"".  Families are important.  Even if Mary Richards was an orphan, didn't she know her family history -- even that of her adoptive or foster parents?",1304899200,,2654,4.848552338530067

Watching this show is like sharing an evening with an old friend AND reliving part of my childhood at the same time. I was born in 61 and, after watching mostly westerns in the 60's, I fell in love with Mary, Rhoda, Phyllis and the gang. I really thought life as a single gal was like that! I discovered later on that MY single gal experiences were more along the lines of Rhoda's life, but I digress! :D
I'm happy to be able to complete this series, something that I'm apparently not going to be able to do with The Bob Newhart Show or The Big Valley (thanks a LOT Fox!). But, as others have ALSO said, I have a bone to pick about the packaging. When Fox begins something, why can't they complete it?!!? You don't switch packagaing in mid stream.

If you're a collector and want all of the seasons on DVD, then this review won't make much difference, but if you're an average fan who maybe just wants a season or two to have as a keepsake of the show, I'd recommend getting a season other than this one.  It's good, but not one of the absolute best.

Also, I have to echo what several others have said about the packaging of this season.  It really is bad.  The case was damaged when it arrived.  There is no episode list.  I mean, forget about a synopsis and air date of each episode, they couldn't even supply a simple list of the episode titles.  Then the menus on the DVDs are pathetic.  Instead of the titles being listed straight down, they're all bunched up at the bottom of the screen in such tiny print that you can't begin to read them from across a room.  And only a teeny little bullet point lights up next to each one when it's selected so it's really hard to tell which episode you're about to launch.  I really hope they'll put more thought and love into the packaging of seasons 6 and 7.  Mary deserves it.

My 3-star rating takes both the packaging and the fact that it's not the best season from the show into consideration.  It's good entertainment, but it's not the best of Mary.",1265068800,5,1330,4.289156626506024

It also brings back memories of that era of clothing and decor. I was a single w/f about this character's age and an administrative assitant when it came out and I identified with her a lot.  It still brings back those memories of being single, having my own place, dating--good and bad--and when life was good, tv comedies were true comedies and clean jokes got more laughs than the dirty, tasteless ones on sitcoms today.

Instead of the nice format that they used for the majority of the previous sets, this one is just the bare-bones. There are no episode titles or descriptions, just a movie-style package with the three discs inside.

Even more unfortunate is the fact that nobody seemed to care about updating the cast listing on the back of the package. Valerie Harper is still credited as a star, when in fact she doesn't appear in a single episode this season! Betty White has now become a predominate cast member, yet she isn't mentioned.

I guess he just can't be satisfied with Georgette, who also figures much more into the fifth season.  Murray takes some odd turns as well, including his flirtation with anther woman in Barbara Barrie. What holds the season together is the ever strengthening relationship between Lou and Mary, which ultimately leads to her being named Producer of the news show, even if Lou promotes himself to Executive Producer.

I have been enjoying the first four seasons but was sure hungry for more. I finally got my hands on this fifth season and I devoured it within a week! It was great! It was very interesting and cool to see how Mary's personality has developed, from a somewhat intimidated, nonassertive person who always takes care of others, to a more outspoken person who most people respected for her strong opinions, and still is well liked. There is a lot of balance in the episodes, as in not too much focus on one character or another. There are a few that do focus on one character or their story, but most of the time, all the characters are in all the episodes, and this is what makes the show so well rounded to me. I enjoy the full spectrum of what all the colorful characters bring to the show.

When I finished the season, I had that little feeling of sadness, even though I know I can watch it again, or get the whole series, but I couldn't afford that yet. They are like friends to me, and sappily enough, I find myself talking like Mary sometimes. I am not sure anyone knows it, but I do...using words like ""crummy"" , ""lousy"" or other seventies derived words.

I'm on my second replacement set, and Disc 2 of the set has arrived damaged twice. It's maddening, especially since I've been anticipating this release for so long.

As for the show, it's one of the very few TV shows in history that actually got better over time. Most shows get stale or jump the shark after a few seasons, or change direction so that they barely resemble themselves. MTM stayed the course with its simple premise, and managed to get funnier and funnier with each new season. These days, that's unheard of. This is why the idea of holding back the release of the later seasons had so many people screaming -- they really are the best ones.

I can't wait for seasons 6 & 7, and I hope and pray that they are packaged with a little more care than season 5 was. Oh, and would a card insert with the episode listing really have driven costs up prohibitively? Or at least printing the list on the back cover? It's truly shocking how blatantly bare-bones this classic show is being handled.",1256515200,3,1194,4.467889908256881
3067543,4,B0011N19HI,"OK, MTM fans,season 5 is finally, FINALLY here.  I agree with others who think the packaging is cheap (it is) and the lack of an episode guide is cheap (it is).  Even Mary's photo on the cover dates back to the first seasons.  But, let's face it ... if seasons 1-4 of MTM sold like crazy, there wouldn't have been any wait for season 5.  The MTM fans just can't compete with the fans of, say, Friends.  And considering how many newer TV shows with a strong following (Pickett Fences, American Dreams, etc.) have had season 1 released in the past few years without much hope of other seasons on the horizon, I guess we're lucky.

So, I will happily take what I can get.  Each episode of season 5 is uncut and the picture quality is chrisp and clean.  The important ""play all"" feature is available on the main menu of each disk.  I hope for special features when season 7 is released, such as outtakes and/or bloopers if they exist, cast commentary and cast interviews.  Until then, buy this and support one of our favorite shows!!",1256515200,3,1029,4.425531914893617
3067544,5,B0011N19HI,"Actually, ""Chuckles Bites the Dust"" is sixth season, but the release of the 5th season in a separate package indicates that Fox is finally getting it right and the 6th season is possibly on the way.
Meantime, we can enjoy such fine episodes as ""Will Mary Go to Jail?"", ""Not a Christmas Story"" and of course, ""Ted Baxter's Famous Broadcaster's School"".",1255996800,,351,4.770491803278689
3067545,5,B0011N19HI,"Getting this season on dvd has been like pulling teeth - something that seemed like it would never happen.  The first four seasons of this classic series were released in great box sets with slimline cases and episode descriptions.  They sold very well.  Then fans of THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW waited years and years and years to hear anything of the release of season five let alone a guarantee on the full remaining seasons.  Then we were told the remaining seasons would only be released in a full series set which would include the earlier seasons people already had.  I know I am reiterating what all these reviews say but I must add my frustration as well.

Over the years many lesser known and less popular series were being released on dvd and we continued to hear nothing about MTM.  Then months ago we heard word - season five would be released.  Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Finally!!!!!!!!!  This was not only a tribute to fans and their persistent request for the release as well as tribute to the series which needs to be on dvd.  And what does Fox do.  Instead of going ""Here you go fans - Sorry for the wait but enjoy"" - they issue the most basic boxed set they can.  It is a simple plastic case with the discs simply placed inside.  No word on the # of episodes or any sort of episode guide.  This is the tackiest thing and an insult to MTM and fans.

Of course the show itself cannot be faltered in any way.  This is one of the best series of all times and each season it grew in prominence, artistry and timeliness.  The characters came and went.  This was the first season without Rhoda but due to the quality of the show it carried on flawlessly.  Every episode here is a highlight and the dvd set is a must have.  Just please give us the rest as well.  Season 6 has the infamous CHUCKLES episode and season 7 has the one of the most heartfelt series finales in television history.

Fans rejoice and be happy we have these glorious episodes.  If only there was a way to gewt back at Fox for their totally unprofessional handling of this situation and the release of such a subpar set.  Yes, we fans can print out episode guides ourselves but Fox should be ashamed.  This will sell well as the other seasons did and hopefully we will not have to wait for the remaining two seasons.",1255996800,,2293,4.3871733966745845
3067546,5,B0011N19HI,"The Mary Tyler Moore Show is one of my favorite tv series of all time. I just received season 5, and I love it, but...Seasons 1-4 were packaged in great sturdy slipcovers with good plastic holders inside. And episode listings included. Season 5 is in a cheap plastic cover with flimsy hinged tabs holding the discs inside of it. And Fox didn't bother to include a list of the episodes. I can copy that off the internet, but THEY should have included it. So I give MTM five stars for the wonderful show. But I give Fox no stars for the lousy packaging. What a bunch of cheap Scrooges they are.",1255824000,,592,4.342342342342342
3067557,5,B0011N19HI,"I have to agree with everything that has been said about the packaging on Season Five.

The show is timeless and terrific but I think 20th Century Fox released this in such poor packaging to set us up to buy the complete series when it is released.

The Season Five packaging I received is a plastic case that is wider than seasons 1-4.  This is because the case will hold 8 discs!  What???  Why would 20th Century Fox package 3 discs in a box that can hold 8?  I had to double check and make sure I wasn't shorted discs 4-8.  And because the box is so oversized, the wraparound box art doesn't fit and looks crappy.

I realize these are cosmetic issues that do not diminish the episodes themselves, but I find it annoying that the  Season 5 box doesn't match Seasons 1-4.

Very shoddy all the way around.  Shame on you 20th Century Fox for treating your customers in this manner...",1255651200,,882,4.3496932515337425
3067558,4,B0011N19HI,"It's always with a little sadness that I approach season 5 of this great show.  One of the things I love about the early seasons of the show is the great friendship between Mary and Rhoda.  And with Rhoda gone, I feel the show is missing a little something.  Fortunately, the other cast members step it up and that feeling doesn't last for more than an episode or two.

The joy of a good ensemble comedy is the fact that you do have good strong characters to build upon.  Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) is still living in her one room apartment next to neighbor Phyllis (Cloris Leachman, who only has four episodes this season).  Her work life seems to overtake more of her personal life.  For example, boss Lou Grant (Ed Asner) moves into Rhoda's old apartment at one point.  Ted's (Ted Knight) girlfriend Georgette (Georgia Engel) stops by to visit on a more regular basis.  Heck, even happy homemaker Sue Ann (Betty White) shows up quite a bit more.  And good ole Murray (Gavin MacLeod) is by Mary's side every day at work.

As with the previous seasons, this show features some classic episodes.  My favorite is ""Not a Christmas Story,"" which finds the gang snowed in and mad at each other.  Absolutely hilarious stuff.  Lou turns into a softy after he throws Ted through a door.  Murray struggles with his feelings about only having daughters.  Mary gets a promotion to producer and tries to go it alone with the news.  Sue Ann almost gets replaced by a much younger fan.  Phyllis tries to find a job after a bad economy destroys the family budget.  And in another favorite, Ted finally asks Georgette to marry him, in the middle of the 6 o'clock news.

Even when this show gets serious, like the season opener with finds Mary facing jail time for not revealing a source, it never forgets it is a comedy.  There are plenty of laughs.

Of course, the writing and the acting are all top notch here.  You couldn't ask for a better cast, and they truly bring these characters to life.

As other have noted, the big drawback to the set is the packaging itself.  The shows are on 3 discs.  They could look a little better, but I don't think they are any worse than the other seasons have been.  We get no extras, but we didn't for the last two seasons.  What is unforgivable is no episode guide.  How can I find my favorite episode without it?  True, I can look it up on line, but that's annoying.  Additionally, they cut out the disclaimer voice over from ""The System,"" one of my favorite bits from that episode.

So the set itself loses a star.  But the episodes are still timeless and funny.  Since this is probably the best we will ever get, if you are a fan, get this set.  You will certainly enjoy the core content.",1255564800,9,2722,4.441295546558704
3067559,4,B0011N19HI,"The episodes themselves get 5 stars: the writing, directing, acting, timing, etc. all top-notch and laff-out-loud funny. The picture clarity gets another 5 stars and so does the audio and the price! But let's face it, we know why the price is reasonable: 20th Century Fox seems to have released this with the attitude, ""LET'S JUST RELEASE THIS AND GET IT OUT TO SHUT THESE PEOPLE UP!"" Therefore, it's totally bare-bones...no episode listing, no show info, no promos, no trailers, no commentaries, not even ad inserts! No nuttin' except the episodes. It's a friggin' shame, because the episodes in this season make me laff out loud...Ted Knight really lets his Baxter-isms fly and Mary is at her total babe-ness. So even though it didn't get the proper respect & release treatment, you will still totally enjoy these shows and try to forget the packaging flaws.",1255564800,6,860,4.937931034482759

I suggest to fans that they wait for the entire series release, and rent this instead of buying.",1255478400,7,420,4.2625

This clearly was a case of Fox saying ""Let's get SOMETHING out on the streets so those MTM fans will shut up already.""  Well, until seasons 6 and 7 are released (and -- we hope -- with more love & care) -- we won't!

On a brighter note: The episodes themselves are hilarious, and each runs the full original 26 minutes.  Prepare to laugh!",1255392000,3,526,4.542553191489362

The Mary Tyler Moore Show in my opinion was/is (along with The Odd Couple) the funniest show on television. And time has not diminished that. It is still as fresh and original today. It contains what all sitcoms today lack. Great acting, writing, and most of all heart. I was so happy when I finally heard that Season 5(along with 6 and 7 coming later on) was being released. I got my dvd copy the first day. I however was very shocked when I saw that the same care in the packaging was not continued. No information of any kind. Wrong cast listing. And just very cheaply made. Not to mention any bonus material. I am glad that the shows are at full length, with no editing. However I feel so much more care should have been put into this. This show deserves all the care and respect that it earned during it's original run and still deserves today. Apparently Fox didn't think so. I also feel that the quality of the transfers are TERRIBLE. So much grain that I couldn't believe it. There has been no restoration or remastering of any kind. The transfers are clean, but it is so fuzzy and grainy that it can be a little distracting at times. In short a great show with a terrible presentation. Hope Fox will improve their act for seasons 6 and 7.",1255305600,15,1359,4.354330708661418

3067565,4,B0011N19HI,"What can I say?  I was excited my season 5 arrived 5 days earlier than Amazon had stated. But it was a mixed blessing in a couple ways. First off, the flat thin mailer Amazon used suffered a hit and a tore opening.  When I pulled the case out, it was clear that 20th Century Fox has produced this season 5 title in a FAR cheaper manner. The case is a thin plastic and is devoid of of any ino., episode guide/synopsis, etc. There is NO extras listed.
I then discovered the case was severly damaged in several ways. The top and bottom edges were badly cracked and split.  The inner spine as well as the flip-tray spindle top notch that holds it was completely broken off. Thus, the case was rendered useless to house the discs in any reasonable fashion.
Not sure if the transit or that coupled with the fragile design added to it's ultimate demise.
Very disappointing Fox didn't continue it's superior former  case slip cover, tray design as seen in season's 1-4.
But a stroke of sheer luck, I had an extra case that was sent from paramount a while back on another title w/ the same case issues, had first sent me the wrong case prior to sending the correct one. And by more luck, was also a 3 disc design and the same type as the MTM case!  Fox clearly in it's effort to after MONTHS of fan demand for season 5-7, took VERY little effort to release this season in the same exceptioonal quality.  I'm just now watching the first episode and the picture quality at least is great.  Why The Rhoda series 1st season released was in such bad video shape, when both these series were produced at the same time and same studio!?",1255132800,5,1620,4.344370860927152

There is no list of episodes anywhere on the package! That saves Fox $1 for every 10,000 copies they make. you'll have to make your own list. I challenge anyone to find any other TV series packaged in this way.

whoever is responsible at FOX video for these sets could take some lessons from other great shows that have been released on DVD in a more timely and attractive manner - i.e. ""the golden girls"" and ""that girl"" to name just a couple.",1254960000,8,558,4.205607476635514

I'd like to say I'm putting my foot down and not buying the last 2 seasons but who am I kidding.

3067583,1,B0011N19HI,"I just watched Epsiode 17 of the fifth season, The System.  It aired on January 11, 1975, the night before Super Bowl IX.  Most every MTM fan knows that the writers had to declare a winner before the actual game was played.  They also wrote a tongue-in-cheek apology that Ms. Moore read over the closing credits.  It is not to be heard on this DVD set.

Other consumers are writing about how nice it is that we finally have Season 5.  I disagree; I think it is a travesty.  Like others, I waited three years for this.  It arrived in a package so poorly designed that no self-respecting Graphics Designer would claim credit for. Everything about the cover has that fuzzy quality of a bootleg DVD sold on a street corner.  The episodes that I have watched so far look ok, but no better than what I have seen airing on Nick at Nite or TV Land.  As a consumer, I won't accept something so shoddy.  As a fan of the show, I will not watch this.  The real irony here is that I am not returning it.  I already had a copy of Season 5, but I am giving it to a friend.  Yes, it was one of ""those"" copies.  I was not going to wait for FOX to release the series.  If I did, I'd be as old as everyone in the newsroom was in the ""Lou's Daydream"" scene of Mary's Three Husbands.

And where is Ms. Moore in all this?  Not to mention Grant Tinker, James L. Brooks, Allan Burns, Jay Sandrich, the cast, the writers and just about everyone else connected with MTM.  Every person who worked on MTM and had the opportunity to be interviewed about it mentions how special this show was.  They state how the experience of making it had touched their lives.  Did something happen recently that your fans don't know about?  Is it any less special today?  I sincerely hope not.

Maybe Ms. Moore and Mr. Tinker made an error by selling MTM Enterprises.  I compare it to that other family-owned television production company.  What was it called?  Oh yes, Desilu.  I doubt that Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr. would allow anything related to I Love Lucy to be released to the public in a manner like MTM is.

Apropos of Ms. Moore's Animal Rights advocacy, I have an analogy to sum up how I feel about this DVD set.  The FOX took a bite out of Mimsie the Cat.  Mimsie leapt, and in the process ""jumped the shark"", taking the show with her.  What a shame.",1254873600,13,2324,4.247139588100686
3067584,5,B0011N19HI,"I just got MTM season 5 today in the mail from Amazon.  Like everyone else, I waited for years for Fox to decide to release this bare-bones set.  I'd given up on having them bring back Ed Asner's son to bring extras to the sets, as he did for season 1 and 2, after seeing nothing extra in seasons 3 and 4.  And I've followed for years all of the complaining that fans of this treasured series have been making about the release pattern.

But now it's here -- and I haven't looked at any of the material on the discs yet, because I'm still in shock at the packaging.  It's in a very tiny, very slim, very plastic case.  It looks ridiculous on the shelf next to seasons 1 thru 4.  And cover art?  The front is fine -- in keeping with the other season's versions of an MTM photo around her ""M"" -- I'm not sure it's from the 5th season, as her hair looks a bit too long -- but on the back cover?  Two pictures -- a group picture of the correct cast for this season, but then a small picture of a first or second season long haired Mary with Ted.  And the cast list?  Although Georgia Engel and Betty White are pictured, Valerie Harper and Cloris Leachman are listed as in the cast (who were not in the regular season cast), with not a written mention of Georgia and Betty.  Does Fox have absolutely no one employed there who could even check the accuracy of the picture selection and cast list?

#2 these season sets are being produced by a major company FOX and they throw out this beloved show out onto the streets looking like a $1 bin package.
I don't mind at all that these discs are in a nice compact case. it's just the poor design of the cover and no insert or booklet with an episode guide. The back of the box lists all the stars of the show eccept Betty White, who is a major player on the show by this season. The disc menus are ugly, though not as ugly as season 4. FOX really should be ashamed on how they come accross looking when you put them next to smaller companys as MPI and Shout, because at least they put their package together with the fans in mind instead of ""lets save 2 cents and gain $20"". FOX just keeps insulting us the fans by making us wait and to how they throw up their packaging at us like doggie scraps.

Also, I am also thankful that forums like Amazon.com exist so that we can express our opinion freely and know that we are not alone in our disgust for Fox's action.

I won't copy the entire article, but here are some relevant quotes:

FANS of one of the greatest sitcoms in history, you finally have cause to rejoice: Chuckles the Clown is, once again, going to bite the dust, and this time he's doing it on DVD.

What knocked the series off the fast track, according to Steven Feldstein, senior vice president for corporate and marketing communications at 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, was a glutted marketplace. ""We looked at the landscape of the TV-to-DVD business and stepped back,"" he said. ""The other studios were dumping stuff that nobody wanted onto DVD. I mean, `What you talkin' 'bout, Willis?' Come on. People were dumping everything.""

This May [Oprah Winfrey] devoted an hour of her show to a reunion of the entire surviving original cast, complete with a replica of the WJM set. During the show Ms. Winfrey wept with joy.

Fox got the message and has now committed to releasing all three remaining seasons, covering episodes from the fall of 1974 to the spring of 1977.",1220832000,91,1100,4.978142076502732

3067634,5,B0011N19HI,"The ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" is nothing short of brilliant, all seven years of it.  This show was ground-breaking, innovative, full of Emmy Awards, hilarious, and honestly just sheer genius. It boggles my mind how Fox could make seasons 1-4 and then just HALT the rest of the DVD's from production?  I heard Fox claimed that the first four seasons were not very good sellers so they just decided to stop, period.  It's outrageous. I see the most bizarre, forgotten, pitiful series that have come to DVD and yet this masterpiece of a comedy show that set the gold standard for comedy is not even finished? I mean, for God's sake, finish what you started, Fox!  If you want to finish the series and charge a high price, we true MTM fans will pay the price?  It's basic economics with things like this.  You produce less at a higher price.  Give this show the dignity it deserves.  I'm no Oprah Winfrey fan by any measure but even Oprah had a show dedicated to the MTM Show and she had all the cast on.  She had a recreation of the original MTM set and the whole episode interviewed and reminisced about what wonderful memories this show brought.  At the end she said, ""The mary tyler moore show is available on dvd for seasons 1-4."" How sad! If Oprah could get Barak Obama elected, maybe she can get Mary back for us! I can't believe I'm saying this, but, ""Go Oprah!""",1211155200,8,1364,4.4417670682730925
3067635,5,B0011N19HI,"Thank you, Jett Rink, for the head's-up about the Oprah reunion-- I'm taping Oprah this afternoon so I can see it.  I understand from reading a few posts on the Yahoo Rhoda and Mary group that there was no announcement about the release of seasons 5-8, which amazes me and disappoints me no end.  Perhaps Oprah can use her influence on Fox to get these seasons released-- or at least have Fox release the rights to someplace like Shout Factory so *they* can release them!

I'm especially impatient for Season 5, as it has one of my very favorite episodes: ""Not a Christmas Story.""  The very memory of Lou ""singing"" ""Three French hens"" still makes me laugh-- and it's been YEARS since I've see it!

Do the right thing, Fox-- release the remaining seasons or pass them on to somebody who will!",1211155200,6,791,4.542253521126761
3067636,5,B0011N19HI,"I think the reason they hold them back is that they have done some marketing research that shows how far apart to space the season releases in order to generate sufficient excitement for people to buy.

I know it's frustrating and quite frankly, insulting to the consumer, but the marketing guys at FOX must have some formula that determines release timing.

So what's the answer?  I am guessing it is to boycott buying individual seasons of any shows in the future.  But reading these postings on Amazon makes it clear to those guys that the people screaming for release NOW are still going to buy the DVDs whenever they DO come out, and their goal is to get as many people on the fence to buy as possible.  If people stop buying individual seasons (ie decrease demand for the product) and wait for the entire boxed set to come out, they'll get a better price and won't have to go through this.  I suspect though, that consumers who love this show aren't going to be patient enough to do that.",1210377600,4,994,4.4944444444444445

Seasons 5, 6 & 7 won the EMMY Award for Best COMEDY Series. It also gave us more Betty White (in what is her best role to date). The person who is putting this on hold needs to be released of his/her duty at Fox  and replaced by a more qualified person who will listen to the tv audience of yesteryear. We are not kids who buy current trash that is offered to us. We want and deserve quality shows. I, for one refuse to buy any of FOX's other tv series because they will NOT be released. FOX has proven to us that they are not to be trusted in completing any series releases.

3067642,5,B0011N19HI,"It was 1974 and I had just worked one full year.  I had a vacation coming and I flew to California (first vacation/ first time in a plane) because I wanted to watch them tape THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW.  I was told this might not be possible but . . .

On the evening of Friday, August 16th, I was sitting in the studio audience when they taped the episode where, with the excuse of buying a piano, Murray contemplated having an affair with Barbara Barrie.  I saw it all - the apartment, Mr. Grant's office, etc.  Even now (30 + years later), I will never forget that night.  So PLEASE RUSH OUT THAT DVD (and the subsequent years).  Many years later, Mary Tyler Moore appeared at Borders here in NYC to autograph copies of her book, AFTER ALL.  I waited in line and just as I got to her, her pen ran out of ink and I got a few moments to speak to her.  I told her how I had been listening to the radio that morning where the DJ's were kidding her about seeing her for the first time on TV LAND and NICK AT NIGHT.  I told her how I had gone all the way to California to see her tape an episode of the show.  ""Really?"" she smiled (Oh, THAT SMILE).  ""You must be a real fan.""  I told her I kept the ticket (framed) and told her the date and what the episode was about.  She really laughed and said, ""Boy.  You are even a bigger fan than Rosie O'Donnell!""  My shining moment.

How many shows or personalities can have this effect on so many people?  Well, this show has and as I've almost worn out the DVD's from the first four seasons, I can not wait until I get my hands on this one.  Hey.  Amazon.  Can we pre-order?",1207526400,9,1614,4.028391167192429

I took a break from my school-work to watch the series finale with my mother (my father was out of the country and had to miss it, and he was VERY disappointed!!)....anyway, whenever that final episode is shown in repeats on network or cable TV, the footage where the cast breaks out of character is never shown; it's clipped to have the end be where Mary turns out the lights at WJM and walks out the door.

3067650,5,B0011N19HI,"Fox releasing the classic Mary Tyler Moore Show season by season was a mistake. I wish I would have known beforehand that they were only to release the first four seasons and forget the last three, then I wouldn't have purchased the first four the day they were released.

If a publishing company released the first four chapters of a book and ignored the remaining three because they weren't pleased with the sales, they wouldn't be in business for long. Failing to complete the entire series is akin to publishing an unfinished novel. The characters in the Mary Tyler Moore series have lots of great stories remaining; the final three seasons contain some of the best. (Chuckles Bites the Dust, Mary in Jail, etc.)

Fox historically has had a peculiar business model in dealing with their home DVD division. Apparently the bean counters matter more than loyal customers. If Fox ever realizes that when (and if) they decide to complete the MTM series, it will be available for many years to purchase and they will profit from it. Currently all they are doing is angering customers. It may be in Fox's best interest to abandon their DVD Home Entertainment division since they apparently don't know what they're doing.

Fox, here's a tip.....release the three remaining seasons individually, then about a year later release the entire series as a one box set with extras you didn't offer in the individual years such as Interviews with the cast, the first episode of the Rhoda and Phyllis shows, behind the scenes features, and the like; you get the picture. That way us Maryphiles will not only buy the remaining individual seasons but then we will have to buy the entire box set also. You'll double your profits and regain the warm fuzzies from Mary's fans that you have squandered.

The Mary Tyler Moore Show won 29 Emmy awards and three Golden Globe Awards.
The Mary Tyler Moore Show is #11 on TV Guide's list of 50 Greatest Shows of all Time.
The Mary Tyler Moore Show is #1 on Entertainment Weekly 100 Greatest Shows of all Time.
The Mary Tyler Moore Show's opening (Mary tossing her hat in the air)  Entertainment Weekly ranked #2 on their list of ""100 Greatest Moments in Television"".

""Chuckles Bites the Dust"" episode ranked #1 (yes, that's #1) in TV Guide's Greatest Episodes of All Time.
The Final three seasons ranked #11, #19 & #39 in the Neilson Ratings.

.....and knowing this the suits at Fox still haven't completed the Mary Tyler Moore series. Fox, if you don't wish to release the remaining season, please allow another company to do so. Paramount released the entire Andy Griffith Show even tho they were aware that the final three seasons in color wouldn't be big sellers. Let Paramount, MGM, or Starz (formerly Anchor Bay) finish what you started.

Mary was like a 2nd banana to Ted Baxter.  It was terrible.  He was funny in the beginning of the series, because he came and he went.  But by season 5, he was in nearly every scene.  Mary couldn't have a moment alone in her apartment, without sickening Ted at the door.  Such obnoxious behavior repeated and repeated and repeated is annoying and contrived.

3301881,2,B0011N19HI,"I'm being generous in giving this dvd a 2 star.  I loved the first 4 seasons and found myself truly laughing.  To my GREAT disappointment Rhoda is not in this season.  She was the glue that held Mary's sugary character, Phylis's flighty character, and Georgette's incredibly simple character together.  In all that mush there had to be somebody with backbone and a clear head.  Rhoda was so enjoyable to watch and was the perfect backdrop for Mary's otherwise spineless character.  I know millions love MTM, and in my own way I do to; but sadly she cannot hold this show alone.  Trying to replace Rhoda as her close friend with Georgette and Phylis is at once nauseating and painful to watch.  I loved all these characters in their lesser roles but shoving them to the glaring front to fill the gaping hole left by Rhoda gags me.  On top of that, Mary looks older, is more boring and what you kind of affectionately loved at thirty doesn't wear as well when reaching middle age.  I would expect a 40 year old to show a little more strength.  Plus she seems bored and unenthusiastic wih her role.  To make up for the lacking the writers thought it necessary to load the scripts with sexual inuendos----a sure sign they're struggling to write quality stuff.  The first 4 seasons stood on their own.  As Red Skelton once said, ""If the actors and writing have any talent they don't need to resort to sex.""  As I sat without so much as a smile wading through the first disc, I found myself constantly missing Rhoda----hoping  and hoping she'd make even a quick appearance.  What a shame.  I have 3 more of these dvd's coming and will probably ship them right back if this season 5 doesn't get better.  I'll try the Rhoda set.....she can carry her own show alone.",1422662400,,1757,4.538216560509555

3301958,3,B0011N19HI,"'The Mary Tyler Moore Show,' which ran for seven seasons between 1970 and 1977, was, with 'All in the Family' (1971-1979), 'The Bob Newhart Show'  (1972-1978), 'Maude'  (1972-1978), and 'M*A*S*H' (1972-1983), one of the premier American television comedies of its era. The program also had one of the most talented casts ever gathered for a television comedy, the very model of ensemble comedic acting.

As the 1970s dawned, seemingly overnight, the mannered and fanciful comedies of the 1960s, like 'The Beverly Hillbillies' (1962-1971), 'Bewitched' (1964-1972) and 'Mayberry R.F.D.' (1968-1971) were gone. 'Supernatural,' 'rural,' sentimental, and 'Middle Class WASP' comedies were, thanks largely to Norman Lear, suddenly considered pass&eacute;, and were replaced by comedies of 'social realism,' and, in fact, 'realism' of all kinds: early episodes of 'Maude' had a guest asking to borrow a feminine sanitary napkin and Maude herself having an abortion, while Archie Bunker, on 'All in the Family,' routinely flushed American television's first audible, but visually offscreen, toilet.

'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' also offered its viewing audience its share of social precedents: without pushing the envelope too aggressively, the show recognized gay, Jewish, and Black minorities, and suggested the new 'informed' approach the American public should take to then-controversial issues like feminism, premarital sex, sex education for children, anti-Semitism, and even the then-unlikely situation comedy theme of addiction to prescription drugs.

'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' also courted sympathy from audiences by giving Moore's initially perky, charming, and kind-hearted character, unmarried associate television producer Mary Richards, her share of life's miseries, including bad dates, failed parties, exploitive acquaintances, untimely bouts of influenza, and, famously, an inexplicable 'hair bump.'

The problem with Season Five is that the lovable, warm, and generous Mary Richards of the first four seasons is almost nowhere in evidence; the show's producers may have always planned for Mary to evolve beyond the ingenue of the initial seasons, but by Season Five, Richards is inexplicably portrayed as continuously sour, peevish, strident, and markedly less tolerant of others and their behavior.

In fact, in Season Five, the Richards character often comes across as almost unlikable; whether this was the producer's decision or at least partially Moore's choice, via her interpretation of the role, is unknown. Perhaps Moore developed personal problems which spilled over into her performance, or there were overt creative problems with the production itself. Regardless, the Mary Richards of Season Five barely resembles the bubbly, optimistic woman with the long dark hair of the first two seasons.

What, if anything, did this hardened depiction of Mary Richards say about the 'New Woman,' the single 'career woman' of the era?

Since the Mary Richards character is promoted from associate producer to producer of the evening WJM news about the same that her personality conspicuously changes, one logical interpretation of Season Five is that ""for a woman, professional success is no substitute for a happy marriage and a family of one's own,"" the same social model and hard-pressed message offered in 'The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet' (1952-1966), 'Father Knows Best' (1954-1960), and 'Leave It to Beaver' (1957-1963). It's impossible to believe, however, that this is the message the producers consciously intended to promote.

The producers had wedged themselves into a tough, if not impossible, corner: if the romantically-desirable Mary Richards finally met a suitable man and married, then the entire 'fictional unmarried career woman who has made it possible for real women to stay home alone on a Saturday night' angle would collapse, but having Mary remain single throughout her thirties despite the attentions of dozens of handsome, eligible men seemed to suggest that the 'New Woman' could not find personal and mature romantic happiness whether single or married. Mary Richards started to appear--and to act---more like an oddball than a figure to be emulated and admired.

Who the 'revised' Mary Richards does resemble is Beth Jarrett, the repressed, 'unfeeling' and emotionally clipped mother in Robert Redford's 'Ordinary People' (1980), a role also essayed by Moore in a performance which earned her an Oscar nomination.

Worse still, the show ended in 1977 with Mary Richards being fired along with almost all of the rest of the newsroom staff by the new owners of WJM, leaving Mary without a career and without a significant relationship. Thus, the character's journey through the 1970s, while conceivably 'realistic,' seems to have ended in all-around failure.

However, the entire tenor of 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' has changed for the worst in Season Five, and for other reasons beyond the interpretation of Mary Richards: hilarious multi-prismed upstairs neighbor Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) is gone, and forward-thinking, melodramatic, and obnoxious downstairs neighbor Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachmann, who, interestingly, also played Donna Stone's best friend Iris on 'The Donna Reed Show,' one of the premier American television comedies of the 1950s and 1960s) appears in only a handful of episodes.

The producers valiantly attempted to balance these losses by adding Georgia Engle to the cast as the perpetually naive Georgette Franklin, introducing the mercurial, sexually-aggressive cooking show host Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White, who had her own 1950s television comedy series, 'Life With Elizabeth,' which ran from 1952 to 1955), and, somewhat disastrously, by pushing childlike, vain, and stupid anchorman Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) forward so that he becomes a primary, rather than a secondary, character. It's simply too much Ted Baxter, and the character's overexposure dilutes Knight's former great effectiveness in the role. It's simply not believable that Ted and girlfriend Georgette turn up on Mary's doorstep almost nightly, the way Rhoda, who used to live in a converted attic above Mary's apartment, typically did.

Though Georgia Engel was a genuine find as a performer and the character of Georgette charmingly written, neither could fill, as they were expected to, the colossal shoes left behind by Rhoda Morgenstern and Valerie Harper. In the same vein, it's difficult to believe that Mary would cultivate a close friendship with predatory, treacherous Sue Ann, who publicly insults Mary to her face in one episode after another. Why would a successful 1970s 'New Woman' tolerate, even court, open hostility from a 1950s-style matron?

The evidence offered by Season Five suggests that the producers realized that the show's best days were behind them. The writing no longer had its finger on the zeitgeist the way it had in earlier seasons (with key writers like Treva Silverman no longer with the show), and while the program had initially felt organic, 'realistic,' and effortless, after Season Four, signs of strain, toil, and artifice where everywhere.

An episode in Season Six ('Mary Moves Out') was tellingly dedicated to the ""rut"" Mary finds herself in, with Rhoda married and living again in New York City, and Phyllis now living in San Francisco. The producer's answer? Have Mary Richards move from her modest but iconic rental apartment to a much larger one in tony high-rise, a decision that probably wasn't too popular with fans at the time.

When 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' went off the air in 1977, Moore has said that, as 'M*A*S*H' (1972-1983) would do later, the producers decided to end the show while it was still in relatively good form. Whether there should have been a sixth and seventh season is arguable, but 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' started to show major signs of fatigue and 'message failure' here.",1349308800,4,7909,5.452984464431725
3301959,5,B0011N19HI,"I think I've always wanted to be Mary.  I wanted to work at WJM, live in her apartment and look like her.  But there are no substitutes; Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Richards is an original.  She should be bronzed or, better yet, dipped in gold.  Besides, there's no way to follow an act who has worked her way up to producer of the news and, yet, still has enough whimsy to ask her boss to go ice-skating at lunch; someone who is fond of telling stories about being a pom-pom girl but has the wherewithal to go to jail for not revealing her source.  This is Mary, and this is how clever the character development and writing was in season five of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show.""

The 1974/75 season is smart and hilarious, but the writers weren't afraid to add little moments of wistfulness as Mary is shown missing her best friend; Valerie Harper was starring in her own MTM production, ""Rhoda.""  The moments were few, but it's palpable.  When Mary has a problem with a guy, Georgette (Georgia Engel) asks her if she misses talking to Rhoda.  Another time we see Mary, Murray (Gavin MacLeod) and Georgette returning from a shopping trip for Rhoda's wedding.  We all miss the two of them together, but our own wistfulness quickly turns to laughter as the show managed with flying colors.

In fact, they turned out some spectacular episodes this season.  Topping the list is ""Ted Baxter's Famous Broadcasters' School.""  Ted (Ted Knight) gets hooked into sponsoring said school.  When it falls apart, the outcome is one of the best scenes in sitcom history.  Guest star Leonard Frey is hilarious as the school's student.  The reactions to him from Lou (Ed Asner), Mary & Murray should be studied by actors.  Another favorite is ""The Shame of the Cities,"" where WJM does a positive documentary and the response to it leaves Mary tipsy.  She is the best at playing drunk.  ""Not a Christmas Story"" is also a favorite.  Sue Ann (Betty White) is taping her Happy Homemaker Christmas show & has Mary and the gang, who are all fighting, come to the studio for a hysterical holiday meal.  ""What Are Friends For"" has Mary and Sue Ann on a business trip together.  ""You Try to Be a Nice Guy"" features Mary helping a hooker she was in jail with.  The dress Mary wears at the end is insanely funny, but she looked fantastic.

Another great thing about this season is there seems to be more references to the time period.  There are plenty of remarks about the economy and inflation, particularly in ""Phyllis Whips Inflation,"" where Phyllis (Cloris Leachman) has to look for a job.  Super Bowl 1975 is featured in ""The System.""  The most significant is a joke about President Nixon's impeachment; this season began right after Nixon resigned in August 1974.

There are 24 great episodes with good disc quality.  No extras.  As mentioned by others, the packaging isn't the best.  I wish they had listed the episodes, but they're on the discs.

Enjoy season five.  They're so good, you'll laugh and be Mary!  Well... maybe you won't be Mary, but you'll be...merry...do you know what I mean, Mr. Grant?  Hmm...Maybe I'm a little like Mary, after all.",1333152000,,3126,4.632058287795993

3301963,3,B0011N19HI,"""THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW"" is funny.  ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" is well-written.  ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" is full of good acting, and wonderful production values.

Why then did I, (and do I still), nickname this show, ""The Mary Tyler Moore HORROR Show""?  Because Mary is a woman seemingly totally alone.  Yes, she has friends -- but where is her family?  She is dependant on the whims, likes and dislikes of her irrascible boss, ""Mr. Grant"", (Ed Asner).  Her neighbours are very weird -- especially at first.

Oh, she ""turns the world on with her smile"", all right.  She has gumtion and fortitude.  But not everyone does.  Every time I watched this show, I wished with all my heart that ""Mary Richards"" could go back to being ""Laura Petrie"" -- married, loved, and with stability in her life.  I suppose another nickname for this show could be, ""The Perils of Mary"".  And then there was the stereotype of her neighbour, the Jewish Rhoda Morganstern.  The show TRIED to be kind to Rhoda, but stereotypes she exhibited overshadowed any good points in her character.  Being Jewish myself, I literally SQUIRMED inside everytime these stereotypes showed up.  (MY idols are the young and etherea YVETTE MIMEUX, the young and ethereal CAROL LYNLEY.....QUEEN ELIZABETH II -- as a lovely young woman, and as an extremely good-looking older woman, (oh, how I'd love to know those youth-reserving royal beauty secrets!),  MIRA SORVINO, (famous for combining beauty AND brains), lovely Judy Bowker, just about every super-model that ever lived, especially at the beginning of their careers, (esoially JEAN SHRIMPTON, SUZY PARKER and CINCY CRAWFORD), and the young, smart and quite beautiful KATE
MIDDLETON!  I realize these are NOT the stereotypical idols of Jewish ladies.  But then, ALL stereotypes are stupid.  Everyone is an individual.....)

There is a rumour that a high-placed person in the George Bush II administration has ALWAYS been for ""women's lib""....but NOT because it would make more money for women.  Nope.  He was always for it so it would break up families!

It's been a long time since I saw ""The Mary Tyler Moore"" show, so I don't remember if her family was ever shown.  She just seemed in SO vulnerable a position to me.
Rhoda's stereotype also turned me off.  However funny and bright ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was, I felt a chill go up my spine, every time I watched it.

Give me, instead, ""The Waltons"", ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", ""The Donna Reed Show"",
or even ""The Trouble With Father"".  Families are important.  Even if Mary Richards was an orphan, didn't she know her family history -- even that of her adoptive or foster parents?",1304899200,,2654,4.848552338530067

Watching this show is like sharing an evening with an old friend AND reliving part of my childhood at the same time. I was born in 61 and, after watching mostly westerns in the 60's, I fell in love with Mary, Rhoda, Phyllis and the gang. I really thought life as a single gal was like that! I discovered later on that MY single gal experiences were more along the lines of Rhoda's life, but I digress! :D
I'm happy to be able to complete this series, something that I'm apparently not going to be able to do with The Bob Newhart Show or The Big Valley (thanks a LOT Fox!). But, as others have ALSO said, I have a bone to pick about the packaging. When Fox begins something, why can't they complete it?!!? You don't switch packagaing in mid stream. The Andy Griffith Show did it right....Frasier did it right....the packing matches and looks great on the shelf.

If you're a collector and want all of the seasons on DVD, then this review won't make much difference, but if you're an average fan who maybe just wants a season or two to have as a keepsake of the show, I'd recommend getting a season other than this one.  It's good, but not one of the absolute best.

Also, I have to echo what several others have said about the packaging of this season.  It really is bad.  The case was damaged when it arrived.  There is no episode list.  I mean, forget about a synopsis and air date of each episode, they couldn't even supply a simple list of the episode titles.  Then the menus on the DVDs are pathetic.  Instead of the titles being listed straight down, they're all bunched up at the bottom of the screen in such tiny print that you can't begin to read them from across a room.  And only a teeny little bullet point lights up next to each one when it's selected so it's really hard to tell which episode you're about to launch.  I really hope they'll put more thought and love into the packaging of seasons 6 and 7.  Mary deserves it.

My 3-star rating takes both the packaging and the fact that it's not the best season from the show into consideration.  It's good entertainment, but it's not the best of Mary.",1265068800,5,1330,4.289156626506024

It also brings back memories of that era of clothing and decor. I was a single w/f about this character's age and an administrative assitant when it came out and I identified with her a lot.  It still brings back those memories of being single, having my own place, dating--good and bad--and when life was good, tv comedies were true comedies and clean jokes got more laughs than the dirty, tasteless ones on sitcoms today.

That being said, the packaging used for this box set is just not up to par with the previous releases. Instead of the nice format that they used for the majority of the previous sets, this one is just the bare-bones. There are no episode titles or descriptions, just a movie-style package with the three discs inside.

Even more unfortunate is the fact that nobody seemed to care about updating the cast listing on the back of the package. Valerie Harper is still credited as a star, when in fact she doesn't appear in a single episode this season! Betty White has now become a predominate cast member, yet she isn't mentioned.

While Georgette is sweet and funny and adds to the show, for me Sue Ann is grating and annoying, and clearly took away from the humor.  It is so clear when watching this season to see where the character of Joey in Friends got all of his ideas.  Ted Knight is the original Joey!  There are several episodes this season that are VERY good, and then several that are not so great.  Amazon and Fox would get a 2 star from me as there are NO programs with this season to say what the episodes are or descriptions.

Since then in repeats, it has been omitted and replaced with the typical theme music and credits.  This is considered ""The Holy Grail"" for so many MTM fans.

My biggest qualm with this box set is that it isn't as nicely packaged as were the first four seasons.  The distributors went cheap on this one, doing away with the nice fold out glossy paper boxes, and packaging the three discs in one plastic box.  No notes to speak of.  No extras either.  Just the episodes to continue you on your way through the series until they come out with their comprehensive complete set which I see they are pricing at $160.

Season Five is a bit of a letdown in other ways as well.

I guess he just can't be satisfied with Georgette, who also figures much more into the fifth season.  Murray takes some odd turns as well, including his flirtation with anther woman in Barbara Barrie. What holds the season together is the ever strengthening relationship between Lou and Mary, which ultimately leads to her being named Producer of the news show, even if Lou promotes himself to Executive Producer.

Once again the studios have pulled a fast one on loyal viewers, but what can we do?  At least they are making the remaining seasons available individually, which at first Twentieth Century Fox didn't plan on doing in anticipation of their complete box set of this excellent comedy.",1257811200,5,1750,4.958904109589041

I have been enjoying the first four seasons but was sure hungry for more. I finally got my hands on this fifth season and I devoured it within a week! It was great! It was very interesting and cool to see how Mary's personality has developed, from a somewhat intimidated, nonassertive person who always takes care of others, to a more outspoken person who most people respected for her strong opinions, and still is well liked. There is a lot of balance in the episodes, as in not too much focus on one character or another. There are a few that do focus on one character or their story, but most of the time, all the characters are in all the episodes, and this is what makes the show so well rounded to me. I enjoy the full spectrum of what all the colorful characters bring to the show.

When I finished the season, I had that little feeling of sadness, even though I know I can watch it again, or get the whole series, but I couldn't afford that yet. They are like friends to me, and sappily enough, I find myself talking like Mary sometimes. I am not sure anyone knows it, but I do...using words like ""crummy"" , ""lousy"" or other seventies derived words.

I wanted this season so much that I accidentally ordered it twice, once pre ordered and then when it came out. So I decided to give the extra one to my mom for Christmas. We used to watch MTM together when I was young, and she enjoys it too, so I think it will make a fine gift. I sure recommend this season for any MTM fan.",1257033600,,1632,4.210862619808307

I'm on my second replacement set, and Disc 2 of the set has arrived damaged twice. It's maddening, especially since I've been anticipating this release for so long.

As for the show, it's one of the very few TV shows in history that actually got better over time. Most shows get stale or jump the shark after a few seasons, or change direction so that they barely resemble themselves. MTM stayed the course with its simple premise, and managed to get funnier and funnier with each new season. These days, that's unheard of. This is why the idea of holding back the release of the later seasons had so many people screaming -- they really are the best ones.

I can't wait for seasons 6 & 7, and I hope and pray that they are packaged with a little more care than season 5 was. Oh, and would a card insert with the episode listing really have driven costs up prohibitively? Or at least printing the list on the back cover?

Even Mary's photo on the cover dates back to the first seasons.  But, let's face it ... if seasons 1-4 of MTM sold like crazy, there wouldn't have been any wait for season 5.  The MTM fans just can't compete with the fans of, say, Friends.  And considering how many newer TV shows with a strong following (Pickett Fences, American Dreams, etc.) have had season 1 released in the past few years without much hope of other seasons on the horizon, I guess we're lucky.

So, I will happily take what I can get.  Each episode of season 5 is uncut and the picture quality is chrisp and clean.  The important ""play all"" feature is available on the main menu of each disk.  I hope for special features when season 7 is released, such as outtakes and/or bloopers if they exist, cast commentary and cast interviews.

3302042,5,B0011N19HI,"Getting this season on dvd has been like pulling teeth - something that seemed like it would never happen.  The first four seasons of this classic series were released in great box sets with slimline cases and episode descriptions.  They sold very well.  Then fans of THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW waited years and years and years to hear anything of the release of season five let alone a guarantee on the full remaining seasons.  Then we were told the remaining seasons would only be released in a full series set which would include the earlier seasons people already had.  I know I am reiterating what all these reviews say but I must add my frustration as well.

Over the years many lesser known and less popular series were being released on dvd and we continued to hear nothing about MTM.  Then months ago we heard word - season five would be released.  Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Finally!!!!!!!!!  This was not only a tribute to fans and their persistent request for the release as well as tribute to the series which needs to be on dvd.  And what does Fox do.  Instead of going ""Here you go fans - Sorry for the wait but enjoy"" - they issue the most basic boxed set they can.  It is a simple plastic case with the discs simply placed inside.  No word on the # of episodes or any sort of episode guide.  This is the tackiest thing and an insult to MTM and fans.

Of course the show itself cannot be faltered in any way.  This is one of the best series of all times and each season it grew in prominence, artistry and timeliness.  The characters came and went.  This was the first season without Rhoda but due to the quality of the show it carried on flawlessly.  Every episode here is a highlight and the dvd set is a must have.  Just please give us the rest as well.  Season 6 has the infamous CHUCKLES episode and season 7 has the one of the most heartfelt series finales in television history.

Fans rejoice and be happy we have these glorious episodes.  If only there was a way to gewt back at Fox for their totally unprofessional handling of this situation and the release of such a subpar set.  Yes, we fans can print out episode guides ourselves but Fox should be ashamed.  This will sell well as the other seasons did and hopefully we will not have to wait for the remaining two seasons.",1255996800,,2293,4.3871733966745845
3302043,5,B0011N19HI,"The Mary Tyler Moore Show is one of my favorite tv series of all time. I just received season 5, and I love it, but...Seasons 1-4 were packaged in great sturdy slipcovers with good plastic holders inside. And episode listings included. Season 5 is in a cheap plastic cover with flimsy hinged tabs holding the discs inside of it. And Fox didn't bother to include a list of the episodes. I can copy that off the internet, but THEY should have included it. So I give MTM five stars for the wonderful show. But I give Fox no stars for the lousy packaging. What a bunch of cheap Scrooges they are.",1255824000,,592,4.342342342342342
3302054,5,B0011N19HI,"I have to agree with everything that has been said about the packaging on Season Five.

The show is timeless and terrific but I think 20th Century Fox released this in such poor packaging to set us up to buy the complete series when it is released.

The Season Five packaging I received is a plastic case that is wider than seasons 1-4.  This is because the case will hold 8 discs!  What???  Why would 20th Century Fox package 3 discs in a box that can hold 8?  I had to double check and make sure I wasn't shorted discs 4-8.  And because the box is so oversized, the wraparound box art doesn't fit and looks crappy.

I realize these are cosmetic issues that do not diminish the episodes themselves, but I find it annoying that the  Season 5 box doesn't match Seasons 1-4.

Very shoddy all the way around.  Shame on you 20th Century Fox for treating your customers in this manner...",1255651200,,882,4.3496932515337425
3302055,4,B0011N19HI,"It's always with a little sadness that I approach season 5 of this great show.  One of the things I love about the early seasons of the show is the great friendship between Mary and Rhoda.  And with Rhoda gone, I feel the show is missing a little something.  Fortunately, the other cast members step it up and that feeling doesn't last for more than an episode or two.

The joy of a good ensemble comedy is the fact that you do have good strong characters to build upon.  Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) is still living in her one room apartment next to neighbor Phyllis (Cloris Leachman, who only has four episodes this season).  Her work life seems to overtake more of her personal life.  For example, boss Lou Grant (Ed Asner) moves into Rhoda's old apartment at one point.  Ted's (Ted Knight) girlfriend Georgette (Georgia Engel) stops by to visit on a more regular basis.  Heck, even happy homemaker Sue Ann (Betty White) shows up quite a bit more.  And good ole Murray (Gavin MacLeod) is by Mary's side every day at work.

As with the previous seasons, this show features some classic episodes.  My favorite is ""Not a Christmas Story,"" which finds the gang snowed in and mad at each other.  Absolutely hilarious stuff.  Lou turns into a softy after he throws Ted through a door.  Murray struggles with his feelings about only having daughters.  Mary gets a promotion to producer and tries to go it alone with the news.  Sue Ann almost gets replaced by a much younger fan.  Phyllis tries to find a job after a bad economy destroys the family budget.  And in another favorite, Ted finally asks Georgette to marry him, in the middle of the 6 o'clock news.

Even when this show gets serious, like the season opener with finds Mary facing jail time for not revealing a source, it never forgets it is a comedy.  There are plenty of laughs.

Of course, the writing and the acting are all top notch here.  You couldn't ask for a better cast, and they truly bring these characters to life.

As other have noted, the big drawback to the set is the packaging itself.  The shows are on 3 discs.  They could look a little better, but I don't think they are any worse than the other seasons have been.  We get no extras, but we didn't for the last two seasons.  What is unforgivable is no episode guide.  How can I find my favorite episode without it?  True, I can look it up on line, but that's annoying.  Additionally, they cut out the disclaimer voice over from ""The System,"" one of my favorite bits from that episode.

So the set itself loses a star.  But the episodes are still timeless and funny.  Since this is probably the best we will ever get, if you are a fan, get this set.  You will certainly enjoy the core content.",1255564800,9,2722,4.441295546558704
3302056,4,B0011N19HI,"The episodes themselves get 5 stars: the writing, directing, acting, timing, etc. all top-notch and laff-out-loud funny. The picture clarity gets another 5 stars and so does the audio and the price! But let's face it, we know why the price is reasonable: 20th Century Fox seems to have released this with the attitude, ""LET'S JUST RELEASE THIS AND GET IT OUT TO SHUT THESE PEOPLE UP!"" Therefore, it's totally bare-bones...no episode listing, no show info, no promos, no trailers, no commentaries, not even ad inserts! No nuttin' except the episodes. It's a friggin' shame, because the episodes in this season make me laff out loud...Ted Knight really lets his Baxter-isms fly and Mary is at her total babe-ness. So even though it didn't get the proper respect & release treatment, you will still totally enjoy these shows and try to forget the packaging flaws.",1255564800,6,860,4.937931034482759
3302057,1,B0011N19HI,"Although I am happy that seasson 5 has finally been released, I was shocked at how little effort was put into the packaging. You get the three discs and a case. No episode guide to tell you what you are watching. The thin packaging is a great idea for those of us with large collections, but this cut just too many corners. I suggest to fans that they wait for the entire series release, and rent this instead of buying.",1255478400,7,420,4.2625

This clearly was a case of Fox saying ""Let's get SOMETHING out on the streets so those MTM fans will shut up already.""  Well, until seasons 6 and 7 are released (and -- we hope -- with more love & care) -- we won't!

On a brighter note: The episodes themselves are hilarious, and each runs the full original 26 minutes.  Prepare to laugh!",1255392000,3,526,4.542553191489362
3302060,2,B0011N19HI,"Like most of the other reviewers, I awaited very patiently for a long time for Season 5 to finally be released. The Mary Tyler Moore Show in my opinion was/is (along with The Odd Couple) the funniest show on television. And time has not diminished that. It is still as fresh and original today. It contains what all sitcoms today lack. Great acting, writing, and most of all heart. I was so happy when I finally heard that Season 5(along with 6 and 7 coming later on) was being released. I got my dvd copy the first day. I however was very shocked when I saw that the same care in the packaging was not continued. No information of any kind. Wrong cast listing. And just very cheaply made. Not to mention any bonus material. I am glad that the shows are at full length, with no editing. However I feel so much more care should have been put into this. This show deserves all the care and respect that it earned during it's original run and still deserves today. Apparently Fox didn't think so. I also feel that the quality of the transfers are TERRIBLE. So much grain that I couldn't believe it. There has been no restoration or remastering of any kind. The transfers are clean, but it is so fuzzy and grainy that it can be a little distracting at times. In short a great show with a terrible presentation. Hope Fox will improve their act for seasons 6 and 7.",1255305600,15,1359,4.354330708661418
3302061,5,B0011N19HI,"I'm thrilled to finally get season 5! However.....the packaging stinks with no info regarding the shows in the plastic case. Yes, they went VERY cheap with the 5th season. Why not not fore-go the plastic case and slap the dvd's in an envelope and call it a day???.....",1255132800,11,268,4.604166666666667
3302062,4,B0011N19HI,"What can I say?  I was excited my season 5 arrived 5 days earlier than Amazon had stated. But it was a mixed blessing in a couple ways. First off, the flat thin mailer Amazon used suffered a hit and a tore opening.  When I pulled the case out, it was clear that 20th Century Fox has produced this season 5 title in a FAR cheaper manner. The case is a thin plastic and is devoid of of any ino., episode guide/synopsis, etc. There is NO extras listed.
I then discovered the case was severly damaged in several ways. The top and bottom edges were badly cracked and split.  The inner spine as well as the flip-tray spindle top notch that holds it was completely broken off. Thus, the case was rendered useless to house the discs in any reasonable fashion.
Not sure if the transit or that coupled with the fragile design added to it's ultimate demise.
Very disappointing Fox didn't continue it's superior former  case slip cover, tray design as seen in season's 1-4.
But a stroke of sheer luck, I had an extra case that was sent from paramount a while back on another title w/ the same case issues, had first sent me the wrong case prior to sending the correct one. And by more luck, was also a 3 disc design and the same type as the MTM case!  Fox clearly in it's effort to after MONTHS of fan demand for season 5-7, took VERY little effort to release this season in the same exceptioonal quality.  I'm just now watching the first episode and the picture quality at least is great.  Why The Rhoda series 1st season released was in such bad video shape, when both these series were produced at the same time and same studio!?",1255132800,5,1620,4.344370860927152

Also, the back cover doesn't have the correct cast information.  Pretty disappointed in the lack of quality control.  Is there no one at FOX who is a fan of the show?!?

I hope it doesn't take another couple of years for the remaining seasons to be released.

They're cut costs by slimming the case to fit all three discs into one sleeve. That's all well and fine, however the color printed insert is one sided with no episode guide and very generic description and artwork with the wrong cast list.  They list Valerie Harper (who does not appear after season 4) and do not list Betty White and Georgia Engel.

I suppose there will be some reviewers that will say ""we should be glad that Fox deigned to cast this before us"" but, if you're going to do something, you should do it right. Clearly, Fox couldn't care less what their customers think of them. GM used to think that way.

There is no list of episodes anywhere on the package! That saves Fox $1 for every 10,000 copies they make. you'll have to make your own list. I challenge anyone to find any other TV series packaged in this way.

Then, when you try to highlight the episodes while viewing, the selection is nearly impossible to see. Good job, Fox. Somehow, I knew you'd find a way to re-enforce your poor image.",1254960000,20,797,4.489655172413793

whoever is responsible at FOX video for these sets could take some lessons from other great shows that have been released on DVD in a more timely and attractive manner - i.e. ""the golden girls"" and ""that girl"" to name just a couple.",1254960000,8,558,4.205607476635514

No episode listing and Betty White not being listed in the cast shows you how much time and attention the people at Warners put into this package. I'd like to say I'm putting my foot down and not buying the last 2 seasons but who am I kidding. The one thing that will really piss me off is if they release the series set with a bunch of features we didn't get on the single season sets.",1254960000,9,546,4.11214953271028
3302080,1,B0011N19HI,"I just watched Epsiode 17 of the fifth season, The System.  It aired on January 11, 1975, the night before Super Bowl IX.  Most every MTM fan knows that the writers had to declare a winner before the actual game was played.  They also wrote a tongue-in-cheek apology that Ms. Moore read over the closing credits.  It is not to be heard on this DVD set.

Other consumers are writing about how nice it is that we finally have Season 5.  I disagree; I think it is a travesty.  Like others, I waited three years for this.  It arrived in a package so poorly designed that no self-respecting Graphics Designer would claim credit for. Everything about the cover has that fuzzy quality of a bootleg DVD sold on a street corner.  The episodes that I have watched so far look ok, but no better than what I have seen airing on Nick at Nite or TV Land.  As a consumer, I won't accept something so shoddy.  As a fan of the show, I will not watch this.  The real irony here is that I am not returning it.  I already had a copy of Season 5, but I am giving it to a friend.  Yes, it was one of ""those"" copies.  I was not going to wait for FOX to release the series.  If I did, I'd be as old as everyone in the newsroom was in the ""Lou's Daydream"" scene of Mary's Three Husbands.

And where is Ms. Moore in all this?  Not to mention Grant Tinker, James L. Brooks, Allan Burns, Jay Sandrich, the cast, the writers and just about everyone else connected with MTM.  Every person who worked on MTM and had the opportunity to be interviewed about it mentions how special this show was.  They state how the experience of making it had touched their lives.  Did something happen recently that your fans don't know about?  Is it any less special today?  I sincerely hope not.

Maybe Ms. Moore and Mr. Tinker made an error by selling MTM Enterprises.  I compare it to that other family-owned television production company.  What was it called?  Oh yes, Desilu.  I doubt that Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr. would allow anything related to I Love Lucy to be released to the public in a manner like MTM is.

Apropos of Ms. Moore's Animal Rights advocacy, I have an analogy to sum up how I feel about this DVD set.  The FOX took a bite out of Mimsie the Cat.  Mimsie leapt, and in the process ""jumped the shark"", taking the show with her.  What a shame.",1254873600,13,2324,4.247139588100686
3302081,5,B0011N19HI,"I just got MTM season 5 today in the mail from Amazon.  Like everyone else, I waited for years for Fox to decide to release this bare-bones set.  I'd given up on having them bring back Ed Asner's son to bring extras to the sets, as he did for season 1 and 2, after seeing nothing extra in seasons 3 and 4.  And I've followed for years all of the complaining that fans of this treasured series have been making about the release pattern.

But now it's here -- and I haven't looked at any of the material on the discs yet, because I'm still in shock at the packaging.  It's in a very tiny, very slim, very plastic case.  It looks ridiculous on the shelf next to seasons 1 thru 4.  And cover art?  The front is fine -- in keeping with the other season's versions of an MTM photo around her ""M"" -- I'm not sure it's from the 5th season, as her hair looks a bit too long -- but on the back cover?  Two pictures -- a group picture of the correct cast for this season, but then a small picture of a first or second season long haired Mary with Ted.  And the cast list?  Although Georgia Engel and Betty White are pictured, Valerie Harper and Cloris Leachman are listed as in the cast (who were not in the regular season cast), with not a written mention of Georgia and Betty.  Does Fox have absolutely no one employed there who could even check the accuracy of the picture selection and cast list?

I'll still give the show 5 stars, because everyone should enjoy this show.  But Fox -- shame....",1254873600,7,1488,4.193661971830986

#1 It's taking so long to complete this great series.
#2 these season sets are being produced by a major company FOX and they throw out this beloved show out onto the streets looking like a $1 bin package.
I don't mind at all that these discs are in a nice compact case. it's just the poor design of the cover and no insert or booklet with an episode guide. The back of the box lists all the stars of the show eccept Betty White, who is a major player on the show by this season. The disc menus are ugly, though not as ugly as season 4. FOX really should be ashamed on how they come accross looking when you put them next to smaller companys as MPI and Shout, because at least they put their package together with the fans in mind instead of ""lets save 2 cents and gain $20"". FOX just keeps insulting us the fans by making us wait and to how they throw up their packaging at us like doggie scraps. Too me this Is them saying ""You all are $#it, heres another season and now shut up""

Now we have to buy the complete series to get a episode guide booklet?

So disgusted that this show is being treated like this..a shame.",1254873600,8,1310,4.073643410852713

CHEERS TO FOX
The reproduction is outstanding!  The crispness and colors are among the best TV on DVD's I have ever seen.

JEERS TO FOX:
Would it have broken the budget to include a 1 page episode list as an insert?
Also, the back of the package says starring Valerie Harper.  In season 5, Valerie Harper is in New York as Rhoda.",1254787200,4,389,4.216216216216216

Mary Tyler Moore should be insulted -- no listing of episodes, just disks inside those cheap DVD boxes everyone is using now.  Probably the economy, but the earlier seasons (as well as other shows we are seeing this happen to -- Happy Days, etc.), they look like something you'd burn yourself.

I rather want them to take their time and the product will be in first class condition, than for them to hurry it out at the expense of quality.

Maybe Fox has learned a lesson and will get season 5 of the Bob Newhart Show out as well - also, after a three-year wait!
Also, I am also thankful that forums like Amazon.com exist so that we can express our opinion freely and know that we are not alone in our disgust for Fox's action. For a long time I have believed that Amazon is more than just another place to buy something, and this experience confirmed that belief.

I won't copy the entire article, but here are some relevant quotes:

FANS of one of the greatest sitcoms in history, you finally have cause to rejoice: Chuckles the Clown is, once again, going to bite the dust, and this time he's doing it on DVD.

What knocked the series off the fast track, according to Steven Feldstein, senior vice president for corporate and marketing communications at 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, was a glutted marketplace. ""We looked at the landscape of the TV-to-DVD business and stepped back,"" he said. ""The other studios were dumping stuff that nobody wanted onto DVD. I mean, `What you talkin' 'bout, Willis?' Come on. People were dumping everything.""

This May [Oprah Winfrey] devoted an hour of her show to a reunion of the entire surviving original cast, complete with a replica of the WJM set. During the show Ms. Winfrey wept with joy.

Fox got the message and has now committed to releasing all three remaining seasons, covering episodes from the fall of 1974 to the spring of 1977.",1220832000,91,1100,4.978142076502732

This show was ground-breaking, innovative, full of Emmy Awards, hilarious, and honestly just sheer genius. It boggles my mind how Fox could make seasons 1-4 and then just HALT the rest of the DVD's from production?  I heard Fox claimed that the first four seasons were not very good sellers so they just decided to stop, period.  It's outrageous. I see the most bizarre, forgotten, pitiful series that have come to DVD and yet this masterpiece of a comedy show that set the gold standard for comedy is not even finished? I mean, for God's sake, finish what you started, Fox!  If you want to finish the series and charge a high price, we true MTM fans will pay the price?  It's basic economics with things like this.  You produce less at a higher price.  Give this show the dignity it deserves.  I'm no Oprah Winfrey fan by any measure but even Oprah had a show dedicated to the MTM Show and she had all the cast on.  She had a recreation of the original MTM set and the whole episode interviewed and reminisced about what wonderful memories this show brought.  At the end she said, ""The mary tyler moore show is available on dvd for seasons 1-4."" How sad! If Oprah could get Barak Obama elected, maybe she can get Mary back for us!

I understand from reading a few posts on the Yahoo Rhoda and Mary group that there was no announcement about the release of seasons 5-8, which amazes me and disappoints me no end.  Perhaps Oprah can use her influence on Fox to get these seasons released-- or at least have Fox release the rights to someplace like Shout Factory so *they* can release them!

I'm especially impatient for Season 5, as it has one of my very favorite episodes: ""Not a Christmas Story.""  The very memory of Lou ""singing"" ""Three French hens"" still makes me laugh-- and it's been YEARS since I've see it!

3302133,5,B0011N19HI,"I think the reason they hold them back is that they have done some marketing research that shows how far apart to space the season releases in order to generate sufficient excitement for people to buy.

I know it's frustrating and quite frankly, insulting to the consumer, but the marketing guys at FOX must have some formula that determines release timing.

So what's the answer?  I am guessing it is to boycott buying individual seasons of any shows in the future.  But reading these postings on Amazon makes it clear to those guys that the people screaming for release NOW are still going to buy the DVDs whenever they DO come out, and their goal is to get as many people on the fence to buy as possible.

3302135,5,B0011N19HI,"The best sitcom of all time is THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW. Fox has been playing with us with the release of this series. Seasons 5, 6 & 7 won the EMMY Award for Best COMEDY Series. It also gave us more Betty White (in what is her best role to date). The person who is putting this on hold needs to be released of his/her duty at Fox  and replaced by a more qualified person who will listen to the tv audience of yesteryear. We are not kids who buy current trash that is offered to us. We want and deserve quality shows. I, for one refuse to buy any of FOX's other tv series because they will NOT be released. FOX has proven to us that they are not to be trusted in completing any series releases. So, until this series is completed, I would not advise anyone to buy NEWHART since Bob Newhart's other series also got put on hold (like MTM's).

Fox plainly shows by releasing the first four seasons and then refusing to release the last three that it has no concerns for the commitments that it makes to its customers at all.  How they could release half of a series and then drop it is beyond me.",1207699200,4,560,4.388349514563107

3302139,5,B0011N19HI,"It was 1974 and I had just worked one full year.  I had a vacation coming and I flew to California (first vacation/ first time in a plane) because I wanted to watch them tape THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW.  I was told this might not be possible but . . .

On the evening of Friday, August 16th, I was sitting in the studio audience when they taped the episode where, with the excuse of buying a piano, Murray contemplated having an affair with Barbara Barrie.  I saw it all - the apartment, Mr. Grant's office, etc.  Even now (30 + years later), I will never forget that night.  So PLEASE RUSH OUT THAT DVD (and the subsequent years).  Many years later, Mary Tyler Moore appeared at Borders here in NYC to autograph copies of her book, AFTER ALL.  I waited in line and just as I got to her, her pen ran out of ink and I got a few moments to speak to her.  I told her how I had been listening to the radio that morning where the DJ's were kidding her about seeing her for the first time on TV LAND and NICK AT NIGHT.  I told her how I had gone all the way to California to see her tape an episode of the show.  ""Really?"" she smiled (Oh, THAT SMILE).  ""You must be a real fan.""  I told her I kept the ticket (framed) and told her the date and what the episode was about.  She really laughed and said, ""Boy.  You are even a bigger fan than Rosie O'Donnell!""  My shining moment.

How many shows or personalities can have this effect on so many people?  Well, this show has and as I've almost worn out the DVD's from the first four seasons, I can not wait until I get my hands on this one.  Hey.  Amazon.  Can we pre-order?",1207526400,9,1614,4.028391167192429

I took a break from my school-work to watch the series finale with my mother (my father was out of the country and had to miss it, and he was VERY disappointed!!)....anyway, whenever that final episode is shown in repeats on network or cable TV, the footage where the cast breaks out of character is never shown; it's clipped to have the end be where Mary turns out the lights at WJM and walks out the door.  Please, please, restore that extra, wonderful footage to its rightful place of honor at the end of one of the best series ever carried on network television!!

3302147,5,B0011N19HI,"Fox releasing the classic Mary Tyler Moore Show season by season was a mistake. I wish I would have known beforehand that they were only to release the first four seasons and forget the last three, then I wouldn't have purchased the first four the day they were released.

If a publishing company released the first four chapters of a book and ignored the remaining three because they weren't pleased with the sales, they wouldn't be in business for long. Failing to complete the entire series is akin to publishing an unfinished novel. The characters in the Mary Tyler Moore series have lots of great stories remaining; the final three seasons contain some of the best. (Chuckles Bites the Dust, Mary in Jail, etc.)

Fox historically has had a peculiar business model in dealing with their home DVD division. Apparently the bean counters matter more than loyal customers. If Fox ever realizes that when (and if) they decide to complete the MTM series, it will be available for many years to purchase and they will profit from it. Currently all they are doing is angering customers. It may be in Fox's best interest to abandon their DVD Home Entertainment division since they apparently don't know what they're doing.

Fox, here's a tip.....release the three remaining seasons individually, then about a year later release the entire series as a one box set with extras you didn't offer in the individual years such as Interviews with the cast, the first episode of the Rhoda and Phyllis shows, behind the scenes features, and the like; you get the picture. That way us Maryphiles will not only buy the remaining individual seasons but then we will have to buy the entire box set also. You'll double your profits and regain the warm fuzzies from Mary's fans that you have squandered.

The Mary Tyler Moore Show won 29 Emmy awards and three Golden Globe Awards.
The Mary Tyler Moore Show is #11 on TV Guide's list of 50 Greatest Shows of all Time.
The Mary Tyler Moore Show is #1 on Entertainment Weekly 100 Greatest Shows of all Time.
The Mary Tyler Moore Show's opening (Mary tossing her hat in the air)  Entertainment Weekly ranked #2 on their list of ""100 Greatest Moments in Television"".

""Chuckles Bites the Dust"" episode ranked #1 (yes, that's #1) in TV Guide's Greatest Episodes of All Time.
The Final three seasons ranked #11, #19 & #39 in the Neilson Ratings.

.....and knowing this the suits at Fox still haven't completed the Mary Tyler Moore series. Fox, if you don't wish to release the remaining season, please allow another company to do so. Paramount released the entire Andy Griffith Show even tho they were aware that the final three seasons in color wouldn't be big sellers. Let Paramount, MGM, or Starz (formerly Anchor Bay) finish what you started.

Just got a letter from Amazon saying that they were still trying to fill the order MTM 5, but apparently there is trouble getting it.  I'm not surprised. I doubt MTM 5 or 6,7 will ever be released.

Well, I finally got #5.  Most ever scene was Ted Baxter, and I can't take too much of him, but all of Season 5 became not MTM, but the Ted Baxter show and that screwy girl friend of his.  Mary was like a 2nd banana to Ted Baxter.  It was terrible.  He was funny in the beginning of the series, because he came and he went.  But by season 5, he was in nearly every scene.  Mary couldn't have a moment alone in her apartment, without sickening Ted at the door.  Such obnoxious behavior repeated and repeated and repeated is annoying and contrived. Ted was OK as a 3rd banana but by the 5th story, he was the star.  For people who like slapstick, I guess they liked it, but I can't stand his type of humor.

I guess the show collapsed without the ""Rhoda, Mary and Phillis"" combo and Murry and Mr. Grant, and even Mr. Grant's scripts got worse in season 5.  Too bad.",1200096000,47,1313,4.175298804780876

With all this concern about illegal copying of protected material, you would think FOX would get smart and cash in with the honest people who are willing to pay for these two quality entertainment shows.

According to TVShowsonDVD.com, FOX has NO plans to release any of the remaining seasons of either series. If that is the case, then FOX should sell the rights and let someone else distribute the series.

Sony is doing the same thing to the remaining seasons of the Partridge Family. They refuse to release the two remaining seasons on DVD and the final album on CD; yet, they are not interested in giving up the rights to another distributor.

Hollywood has yet to figure out that life goes on without them. Slowly but surely, people are finding other things to do than watch television and DVD's. I haven't missed anything from the Fall tv schedule because my family has been watching these great sitcoms on DVD. Now, Hollywood wants to destroy what little entertainment they provide by refusing us the enjoyment of watching the remaining seasons of some of American telvision's greatest shows.
