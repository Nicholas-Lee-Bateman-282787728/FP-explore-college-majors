8604357,1,B00EDVVMUE,Purchased seasons 1 and 2.  Outstanding series - they have English subtitles.  Unable to find season 3 and subsequent seasons with subtitles.  Makes no sense that the distributors limit their market (and their profits) in this manner.  For anyone who is fluent in French I'm sure they will find this boxed set well worth the money.,1455580800,2,331,4.857142857142857
8604358,5,B00EDVVMUE,"A note for people interested in the product: It is in French with no English subtitles.  Season one has subtitles available in French and I believe season five also has subtitles available in French.  I am not a native speaker of French but my French is adequate for understanding the DVDs, although it would be helpful if all of the DVDs had French subtitles available.  You must have a multi-region DVD player or a player that displays region 2 videos to watch the DVDs.  The story is set in World War II France.  It is absolutely addicting and very well acted.  I am enjoying it immensely!",1432771200,5,592,4.537735849056604
8604359,1,B00EDVVMUE,"No English subtitles!!!
The French population would be cut 90% during WWII if not for America.
After the French happily gave up their Jews, the Nazis would have worked on the next class to be exterminated - the French.
For this otherwise outstanding series to be withheld from America by not offering English subtitles is declarative that many of the French still do not appreciate the sacrifice of American soldiers for their freedom from the Germans.
All ""French"" DVD's would be made with German language and German subtitles if not for English speaking/reading America.
Boycott under the producers smarten up to release again with English subtitles!!!!",1425686400,2,655,5.188679245283019

8604361,5,B00EDVVMUE,"I'm part of a group of Francophones/Francophiles  using this gripping series to review and improve our French.  It is extremely well-made, but I have both a warning and a question.  Because we like the idea of seeing the French as well as hearing it, we want the closed-captioned French version, not the exported one with English sub-titles.  But it seems that only seasons 1 and 5 have the closed captions.  Why is that?  Can the closed captions be added to seasons 2,3 and 4? The buyer also has to be sure the version is the one for US regions.",1408924800,4,546,4.4646464646464645
