8196598,2,B000QJMDGY,"A famous author keeps hiring and losing beautiful secretaries until he hires one he falls in love with and marries. Turns out shes a better writer than he is. Unfortunately, this comedy strains to get laughs and falls flat. Keenan Wynn is annoying. If you're looking to see the worst film Kirk Douglas made, this could be it. Laraine Day performs well, and is a bright spot in the film. The best part of the film, though, is The End.",1503014400,,433,4.425
