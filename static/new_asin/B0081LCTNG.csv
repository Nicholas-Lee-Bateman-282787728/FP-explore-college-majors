The people are extremely blurry, the camera is out of focus and one cannot make out hardly anything happening. Very Very dissapointing, in that the Carpenter-Ballee fight was featured in a Sports Illustated article, but visually we have nothing to watch.  Dana White of UFC should get down on his knees and thank Roger Carpenter for being one of the first 'No Holds Barred' fights to have ever taken place.  I doubt seriously that Dana White was even born when this fight took place.  Dan White should have a Hall of Fame for these fighters that paved the way for him...............the Blood and Guts bare-knuckled fighters of the 50's and 60's Karateka.",1442016000,,823,4.892086330935252
8524102,5,B0081LCTNG,"SGM George Pesare like Ed Parker, Robert Trias, Peter Urban, and Allen Steen was vital to the establishment of the martial arts here in the United States. If not for these five US-born martial artists the martial arts would never have been fully accepted by the dues paying American public. Men like Pesare, Urban, Parker, Steen, and Trias paved the way for the ""Asian Invasion"" of martial arts teachers who came in the mid to late 1960's once these five got the art accepted and going. We have to remember that the US had very opposed attitudes towards anything Japanese and anything ""non-Christian"" in origin. Judo had been here since the twenties and never really made it as big as Karate largely because most of the instructors were not native Americans. Pesare taught a version of Kajukenbo which he continued to develop and improve and he produced black belt students who were up there with the best of anywhere in the US. this is shown in the video by his New England Karate squad beating both the Washington DC and Texas karate squads on the Texans home turff! A must see as a time capsule of how karate tournaments looked back from the 1960's to the early 70's.  Pesare narrates and admits that the early training while tougher and more brutal than anything nowadays was actually inferior technique - wise when
compared with the changes and innovations he and others made to karate in later years. Unfortunately much of Pesare's involvement in

training outstanding kickboxers is the late 70's and 80's is left out. Watching Pesare move during the demos he did in the early
70's you can see the use of mobile footwork from boxing and effectively implemented high kicks which until Pesare came along was never seen in any of the Kenpo styles from Hawaii.",1425168000,2,1762,4.736156351791531
