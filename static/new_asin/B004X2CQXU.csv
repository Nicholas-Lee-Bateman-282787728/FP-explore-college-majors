4491744,5,B004X2CQXU,"Great Interview Prep Tool.  I have never seen anything like this.  I have shown it to several managers within my company.  All agree, it is a valuable video that should be studied by everyone in the business community.  Well worth the money and I would highly recommend it.",1303776000,,273,4.625
4491745,5,B004X2CQXU,"I was hesitant to spend the money on this DVD, but I was amazed at how much it actually helped me. If you really want your dream job, this DVD will give you the edge you have been missing. I highly recommend this DVD......it's worth your time and your money!!!",1303776000,,260,4.22
4491746,5,B004X2CQXU,"It's amazing to me how long it took for a tool like this to hit the market, but it's finally here.  This is an invaluable tool for recent grads and/or those ""re-entering"" the job market after years in a career and away from interviewing.  As a former manager/hirer, I know how quickly an opportunity can end for a candidate who isn't prepared, doesn't understand the process, or isn't up to speed on the appropriate questions/answers.  This video covers those topics and others, from the perspective of professionals.  It's a powerful interview preparatory tool.",1303776000,,562,5.010752688172043
4491747,5,B004X2CQXU,"I was very insecure, and for good reason it turns out, when interviewing for high end employment.  After viewing and implementing this video and its tips, I could feel my confidence soar and am in my second round of interviews for the first time.  This is an awesome tool for those who have not interviewed well in the past.  I knew I was an asset, but had trouble selling myself.  Thanks for the help!",1303689600,2,402,4.391891891891892
4491748,5,B004X2CQXU,"I've worked with the same high dollar interview coach on and off for the past 20 years. However, it's difficult to wade through your options & identify who is quality and who is not. The Interview Pro DVD is as close to my personal interview coach as I have ever seen. If you'd like to know how it feels to get an offer on every interview, get this DVD! You can't afford not to.",1303689600,,378,4.121621621621622
4491749,5,B004X2CQXU,Worked great for me to actually visualize the interview and the prep work/tips were helpful.  First time I've seen something like this that was so complete.  Especially like the interactive part.  Good stuff.,1303689600,2,208,5.242424242424242
4491750,5,B004X2CQXU,This video made all of the difference in the world for my interview.  I felt more prepared than ever and that confidence translated to my interview.  I am moving on to the second round with three different companies.  I would recommend to anyone that is planning to interview in the near future.,1303689600,,295,4.634615384615385
4491751,5,B004X2CQXU,"This DVD gave me the tools to compete successfully for my job.

It took the ""guess work"" out of my interview and let me be at ease and myself.  Your ""Cheat Sheet""  was a great help, also.  How did you get it all in??

Thanks, InterviewPro!!  You made the difference in my future.",1303430400,,279,4.169811320754717
8445951,2,B004X2CQXU,"The quality of the video is poor, colors of blue shadows appear throughout the video. Information is okay. Would not recommend.",1416873600,,127,5.095238095238095
8445952,5,B004X2CQXU,"This helped my college graduate son prepare for his first round of job interviews. He says it was a ""cool tool"". I say it was a win because he got his banking job that he wanted. Thanks IP!",1385856000,,189,4.0
8445953,2,B004X2CQXU,Offers great interview scenario clips and tips for sales position candidates. I was interviewing for something completely different. Really should've had this information on the packaging and product description. Both mock interviews were for 2 different types of sales positions. I was pretty disappointed. Otherwise it provides no-brainer tips that any interviewee should know anyway.,1352851200,4,386,6.036363636363636
8445954,5,B004X2CQXU,AMAZING RESOURCE!!! Wow! I wish I would have had this in the past when I went on other job interviews!!!  It helped me get the job of my dreams! I am so thankful!!!!,1349568000,,165,4.0
8445955,5,B004X2CQXU,"After several class sessions on ""Effective Interveiwing"", I played the ""Interview Pro"" video to my class. The students found it most enjoyable and educationally informative. This was evidenced by the many positve remarks made by them after the viewing. Highly recommended.

8445956,5,B004X2CQXU,"Fantastic resource!  After trying to break into the medical field for over a year I bought this video on the advice of a friend. I'd interviewed well in the past and typically made it to the final cut, but could never get over the hill.  Interview pro gave me the confidence and knowledge to give me that extra push.  I'm proud to say that thanks to the guys at intervioew pro I am now a medical sales rep!  If your trying to break into medical sales I highly recommend this product!",1305072000,,483,4.274725274725275
8445957,5,B004X2CQXU,"I have been a recruiter in the medical industry for close to 10 years and have seen that the ability to interview well is 100% what gets a candidate hired!  Most top companies hire talent,interpersonals and the ability to ""wow"" them in an interview over what is on someones resume.  This video step by step shows candidates how to understand the mind of the manager, sell themselves and then close for the job.  I have seen so many solid candidates lose out on life changing opportunities because they could not interview well.  At the same time I have seen lesser candidates nail the same job all because they had the art of interviewing mastered!  I am recommending this video to all my candidates and have my entire recruiting team watching and learning from it as well!  Love it!",1304553600,,783,4.63768115942029
8445958,5,B004X2CQXU,"My recruiter recommended this for my Sales Interview. I've been out of work for 8 months and lost confidence in myself after getting turned down for 4 different sales jobs. The role play scenarios showed me what I was doing wrong.  One scenario focused on how to answer questions if you have been out of work for some time.  Watching this gave me confidence again, and I nailed the interview and got the job!  I'm giving a copy to my brother who is graduating from college in May. There is a section dedicated for college graduates too.",1304467200,,536,4.505154639175258
8445959,4,B004X2CQXU,"I have always felt you can never be too prepared but this really provides the complete package.  It really covered what I wasn't thinking of in my preparation. You only get one chance to make your impression and with the help of ""Interview Pro"" I nailed it in my interview process.  Can't reccomend it enough!  -SJC",1304294400,,315,4.589285714285714
8445960,5,B004X2CQXU,"Who has time to read a stack of books before a job interview...I know I didn't.  This video is a fast, easy way to get you ready quick.  It was the confidence boost I needed for the job interview and well worth the money.  I highly recommend it!!  Bought two more for graduation gifts.
Get this video and Get the Job!!!",1303862400,,319,4.180327868852459
