5013616,2,B006QU70OM,"Not  that I had big expectations, but from a low budget movie I wanted something more in terms of plot, very predictable.
At least the performances of the two lead actors were solid, Stana Katic still a little rough but consistent.
Good Soundtrack.",1348704000,,248,4.767441860465116
5013617,1,B006QU70OM,"PROS
beautiful scenery
good photography

CONS
Emma & Kerry - horrible make up and boring hair styles

Emma & Kerry - limited facial expressions

Acting - lack luster except for a few of the minor characters who actually seem to show a range of acting, however, the lead characters are basically one dimensional, mad, angry or perplexed most of the time

Script - disjointed & limited dialogue; is poorly developed, the only reason you know Emma likes Kerry and vice versa is that the script tells you they do, the script doesn't build any empathy for Kerry or Emma

Story plot - never reveals who is Kerry, who is Emma, why are they friends, how can Emma and Kerry travel to Ireland and be gone several weeks from their jobs, rent a really nice house in Ireland,

SPOILER ALERT:  Kerry's death - is the stupidest part of the movie, Emma's conclusion of Kerry's death comes from out of nowhere and for all of her investigation she leaves Ireland with the wrong answer, the actual cause of Kerry's death is dropped on the audience without a satisfying explanation of why the person did it and the death is visually repulsive",1346544000,5,1122,4.608040201005025
5013618,5,B006QU70OM,"First of all, you get to see beautiful footage of Ireland.  Yay.  (Yep.  Sheep grazing on the mountain and everything!)

Emma decides at the last minute to not join her best friend Kerry on a trip to Ireland.  While there, Kerry washes up on the beach dead.

Emma travels to the country to try and find out what really happened to her. She feels that the police did not do enough.

This movie rolls right along with you gaining some knowledge of how people from small villages in other countries conduct themselves.
It's a very different way of life there and Emma just wants answers.  (I did imagine myself there blowing in like a tornado with my strong willed personality pissing off all the locals making demands left and right.  Lol  Hmmmmmm)

Everyone seems to have their secrets but even so Emma does gain a couple of new friends that help her during her investigation and are very kind to her.

Then...BAM!!!

Note:  I gave the movie 5 stars even though I didn't know any of the actors and usually it takes quite a bit to impress me. I decided to go ahead with the full 5 star rating because of the excellent directing and lead in to the ending.  Best actor in this film?  Paul Hardiman by a landslide.

WARNING:  DO NOT READ PAST THIS POINT IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM.

Now, regarding my thoughts on the death of Kerry.  This is modern times.  WTH???  Why wasn't the area sectioned off and a CSI team called in to scrape under her nails and do a rape kit?
Then...you swab the inside of the cheeks of every single man she came in contact with during her stay there.

After several STRONG and determined interrogations of all who came in contact with her and then a matchy match to the DNA, then wah la!!!  you've got your man and solved the crime.
The one thing wrong with this movie is that it makes you feel like this was set back 100 years ago where the man with da badge say's ""Oh well, these things happen"" and mosey's on back to his comfy office.
It's as if no crime scene investigation was done.  Emma didn't ask about that.  She wanted to see the death cert and that's all she asked for.  This was filmed in present day.  Don't tell me Ireland couldn't or wouldn't solve this crime.
This gal had all kinds of DNA on her.  It's really odd that the film made you feel like nothing scientific was done.

In the states, this would have been an easy case.",1344729600,9,2368,4.3159090909090905
5013619,5,B006QU70OM,"Finished watching ""Truth about Kerry"" not long ago (DVD has arrived earlier today) and let me tell you, this movie is a MUST SEE :) For every STANATIC and not only, just for everybody who loves good movies. This movie has it all - great story, wonderful acting from everybody, but especially from Stana Katic, totally shocking ending which leaves you with your jaw on the floor. Great writing and directing, wonderful cinematography and wonderful cast. Independent movie at it's best :) Personally I think that if this movie had been released at least 4 - 5 years earlier, Stana would have been in completely different place with her film career. Every film director must see it and get Stana for the main parts in their movies. She's THAT GOOD :)

Also the music in the movie is beautiful, great job by Ciaran Hope, he deserves some awards for his score.

I know for sure that I'm going to re-watch this little gem MULTIPLE times :)",1334275200,24,933,4.614457831325301

The ending was unexpected & no one sees who murdered Kerry except the viewer; no one knows why she is raped & murdered except the viewer, for it was never explained unless I missed it. Never would have figured the murderer out. So Kerry's bestfriend leaves Ireland, having wasted an entire trip to never see or learn what the viewer sees.

5013653,2,B006QU70OM,"The two stars were for the scenery. The dialogue was silly, the plot predictable, and character development stunted, with perhaps the exception of the gradually reconstructed narcissistic dead woman whose death gradually seemed less and less regrettable as the film continued. That is not to say her violent end was justified. Am I alone in predicting who the bad guy was?

Why were we expected to be interested in Katic's character when we know nothing about who she is--other than a friend and fianc--or how she lives or why she is so pushy and confident one minute and teary and helpless the next. Katic does more acting in a single episode of the t.v. detective show Castle than in this sad little throwaway.",1398902400,2,712,4.788617886178862

5013656,3,B006QU70OM,"Just watched this on a rainy Saturday by the fire, and found it very atmospheric indeed. The moody landscape views are the best thing about it imo. There's a sense of fascination with Ireland and with Irish music. It was like seeing my own place through new eyes.
The story follows a decent enough emotional trajectory, for the main character at least. But as others have mentioned there's a huge plot hole in the way the Garda supposedly dealt with a death that clearly should have been highly suspicious. An American tourist's body washes up on the shore, battered and half-naked, and the response seems to have been a collective shrug. Ah sure... you know how it is with these young ones.
Note to future American scriptwriters purporting to write authentic Irish dialogue: To bring someone from A to B in your car is to give them 'a lift'. Not 'a ride'. A ride here is something else entirely, and no Irishman who values his facial features will  ask a strange woman if they need 'a ride' in his car. Also, here nobody drowns in 'the ocean'. We know the word but never use it. It's 'the sea', folks. And then there's the elderly man with the heavy Kerry accent talking about his son who, unaccountably, has a sharp Northern accent. What's that about? But admittedly, everything I've mentioned in this paragraph is something that might bother a native but would probably sail right past an international audience.
I saw the final twist coming, but I'd still give a lot of credit for how well it was portrayed and acted. If the film was in danger of drowning in its own melancholy landscapes at times, the final scenes sent it out on a good strong narrative punch.
A good effort, overall. Different, and worth a look.",1387584000,2,1718,4.61437908496732
5013657,5,B006QU70OM,"AMAZON bills this page as Stana-Karic. Don't know what that is all about.
Anyway, Cinematography and scenes shown of the town in Ireland were devastatingly gorgeous.
We are used to seeing Ms Katic with a slight nose bob and highlights in her hair. Stana's look has evolved into a beauty of our time. Breath- taking roles in TV show ,CASTLE, could go on for 10 more years- plus
as far as I am concerned.
The Irish music was haunting and original.

This film could have been great had the writer taken the time to overcome some glaring plot points...who travels all the way to a country to investigate their friend's murder then suddenly decides it wasn't...I'm hoping this was done to create a possibility for a sequel, because otherwise it does not make much sense.

The scene towards the end about the rape and the killing of Kerry by the bartender comes out of nowhere and does not make much sense.

We eventually  find out she was raped and strangled and drowned.  So even though there would be bruises of all kinds and other evidence of rape, its decided she just drowned. Her BFF comes over from America obsessed with the idea she was murdered and then at the end of the movie suddenly decides she committed suicide and leaves.  I could forgive all this if the killer didn't get away with it.  All we are left with at the end is that the brutal deed was done and no one suspects or cares that it happenned.  Stana Katic is great. With her drippy hair and glasses you only occasionally see the beautiful woman we see on Castle.  But every once in a while you catch a glimpse of how beautiful she is even pre-nose job.  Her acting is superb.",1350777600,4,858,4.285714285714286
8503208,4,B006QU70OM,"I thought this was a pretty good mystery as to what happened to this woman.  It draws you in especially the flashbacks and I wondered whether or not  she would gather info to  find the truth about Kerry.  There was also enough people who could have been a potential suspect. There is a lesson in this movie that people are not what they seem especially if you only know them a short time and in a another country, the setting for a real danger.  I also like the ending even though it was sad because it demonstrates real life.  .",1512000000,,529,4.24

8503212,3,B006QU70OM,"Nice little Irish noir film.

For those who like very polished and sophisticated writing and acting, this little independent with a simple story might not be your cup of tea.  It's clearly a low-budget kind of first time effort, but it had some good Irish village life vignettes and some solid Irish mystical moments from the hinterland area of Ireland.

But, for what it is, a simple film where the Irish scenery is the major star, alongside a serviceable mystery, it's enjoyable.

After a couple of very small dots were thrown in for the viewer to connect if paying close attention, I guessed the outcome about 1/3 to 1/2 the way through the film, but when it came, it was still a good turn of plot and a decent pay off for time spent watching.

Big action, huge budget film goers will not be satisfied.  But if you like little unpretentious films with less then stellar performances (but which still serve the plot just fine), this is a just fine.",1506124800,,950,4.5588235294117645
