7885182,5,6305196222,"""Duct Soup"":  Kochanski is not adapting well to Starbug.  Her room is next to the sewage processor, whose clapped out pipes squeak out the sounds I've put on the title on my review.  She is close to breaking something, as she finds Lister's tennis shoes in the fridge and not cotton-cheese with pineapple chunks, and in a hilarious moment, Kryten tries to comfort the tear-stricken Kochanski by giving her... the Heimlich Maneuver!
Then the unthinkable happens.  The generator overloads, goes out, and due to a safety precaution, the door to Lister's room locks everyone inside.  They have twelve hours to avoid a meteor storm so they crawl through Starbug's service ducts, ""two miles of ventways that wind through the ship like intestines.""
We learn that Lister has claustrophobia, and Kochanski's attempt to take his mind off it yields another great conversation, as does his explanation to the Cat of what event that caused him to get claustrophobia.  Memorable lines.  Kochanski on the Cat and Lister watching her underwear spin in the dryer:  ""A couple of posters, some trailers from the World's Stupidest Stuntmen video, and take it from me, that laundry room will be packed.""  Kryten on the ""Rusty Gate"" anecdote relating to Kochanski:  ""Crossfile B for blackmail, A for anecdote, subcategory for S for so funny, you'll laugh till you're dead.""
""Blue"":  In an attempt to get closer to Kochanski, Lister stops eating spicy foods, which gets on the jealous Kryten's nerves, as he now has extra laundry to do, such as tights, bras, skippy vests, and little socks.
An attempt to get Kochanski back to her dimension not only fails miserably, but gets Lister on her bad side.  Lister then finds himself missing Rimmer, of which a wonderful heart-to-heart between Lister and Kochanski results.  There's also an observation that it's certain faults and foibles that make people special and unique.
Memorable lines:  Kochanski to Lister, in reply to whether she slept well:  ""I dreamt of a monkey being stretched across a tennis court.  Were you playing the guitar last night?""  The Cat describes Rimmer as ""irritating, awkward, and unsightly.  He's the human equivalent of a visible panty line.""  And when finishing up in the bathroom, Rimmer used three pieces of toilet paper:  ""One up, one down, one to polish.""  Continuity error:  when aboard Red Dwarf, Rimmer never wore the blue uniform that he gained in ""Legion"" as seen in a reminiscence scene.  The uniforms were actually khaki.
""Beyond A Joke"":  When the crew decide to play the Articial Reality game Pride And Prejudice Land, interracting with the Bennett family, Kryten, who has prepared a lobster dinner for the anniversary of his rescue, not only forcibly returns them to eat, but literally loses his head when Lister asks for some brown ketchup on his lobster.  Fortunately, the ship where they found the AR game has spare mech heads.  Unfortunately, a Simulant calls the ship home.  As Able, another Series 4000 like Kryten explains, ""he's a psychopathic killing machine, but he's got his good points.""  Able is addicted to Ultrazone, a liquid drug that corrupts circuit boards.  ""Well, that's what they say but where's the evidence?""  A few seconds later, he says, ""Have I just said that?""  The title refers to what Kryten has evolved from, and a heartwarming conversation between him and Lister establishes that.  Comment:  Lister says he's not a cartoonivore, he won't eat anything's that's been a cartoon.  Given his past diet, he clearly hasn't seen any Foghorn Leghorn cartoons.  Love that techno music that's played when they enter the asteroid field!
This was one of actor Don Henderson's last roles before his death.  Henderson (the Simulant) played General Tagge in Star Wars (1977).  Again, the Simulant's ship is well-realized, as are the asteroids in ""Joke"" and more deep revelations about Lister, Kryten, and Kochanski make them fuller, richer, and lovable characters.  Great stories!",1059868800,,3962,5.06646058732612
7885183,5,6305196222,"More creative stories and interesting concepts abound in the second part of one of Red Dwarf's best seasons.
""Bodyswap"" involves Lister having to undergo the title operation in order to impersonate Carole Brown, Red Dwarf's executive officer, who has clearance to override the auto-destruct system.  that was caused by a malfunctioning Skutter (service robot) that rewires the entire ship into a booby trap, and which is triggered when Lister orders a milk shake and a Krispy bar.  The Cat then says ""Lucky you didn't order a double cheeseburger.""  The success of the operation leads to Rimmer borrowing Lister's body in order to make it trim, but as an excuse to give Rimmer the experience of having an actual physical body after 3,000,000 years.  After all, because Lister doesn't exercise, smokes and drinks, he has ""more gut than a Turkish butcher shop's window.""  However, Rimmer says, ""I can touch, I can taste, I can smell!""  So guess what happens?  The mashed potato scene is great, but a pint of cream and a pound of butter?  Yuck!
""Timeslides"" is one of my favourites.  Lister is depressed because he is sick of being stuck in space and blames his own entry into the Space Corps for the twist of fate that has him unable to get a job, meet new people, have a family, etc.  As Rimmer says, well, some people get lucky, they get a break.  That just might come when Kryten develops photos in some mutated developing fluid.  Results, the photos come to life and people can go inside them, but only within the confines of the photo.  And I know this is just a comedy, but re one slide, Adolf Hitler, Fascist Dictator Monthly's Mr. October, the footage was taken from Triumph Of The Will (1934), while he didn't invade Czechoslovakia until 1939, and Stauffenberg's attempt on him was ten years later.  Lister decides to meet his younger self and give him an idea to make him rich.  But what about determinism and causality?  As Holly says, there's nothing small about changing history.  As for me, yeah, I'd want to change something about myself, and it ain't small.  BTW, the hard rock Kryten is listening to was composed by Craig Charles (Lister).  And the part of Dave Lister aged 17 is played by Emile Charles, Craig's brother!  And the other two guys in the young Lister's band are members of the thrash metal group Napalm Death.  Love Kryten's definition of a pub:  ""A meeting place where people attempt to achieve advanced states of mental incompetence by repeated consumption of fermented vegetable drinks.""
""The Last Day"" refers to Kryten's.  After a message from Diva Droid International saying that Kryten is to shut himself down, Lister sets about giving him a final party.  There's an interesting idea of android manufacturers inventing a Silicon Heaven (an electronic afterlife) and even an Electronic Bible for robots (""the iron shall lie down with the lamp""), so that they wouldn't mind getting the short end of the stick for serving humans.  Kryten is fastidious in his beliefs, even if it is sham, yet tells Lister that there is no human heaven.  ""Someone just made that up to keep you all from going nuts.""  You tell'em, Kryten!  Rimmer though says ""everyone's entitled to their belief"", no matter how crazy.  And Kryten's definition of fun:  ""The employment of time in a profitless and non-practical way.""  I'm all for that anytime.  We also learn in this episode that Lister was abandoned at six weeks old in a cardboard box, an idea that's developed in the 7th season RD story ""Ouroborous.""
Season 3 ends gloriously with some of the greatest stories and ideas.",1059523200,,3586,4.799347471451876
7885184,2,6305196222,"Red Dwarf went from strength to strength.  Series 5 was amazing, Series 6 was even better.  Then came Series 7.  It started out with a strong episode, Tikka to Ride, and the two episodes which followed (Stoke Me a Clipper and Oroboros) were highly enjoyable.  But after that things just fell apart.  The loss of Rimmer is heavily felt, Kochanski is just irritating throughout this series, the tone of the episodes feels self-satisfied, the characters are just crude parodies of their former selves and the humour is very thin on the ground.
Red Dwarf 7 Byte 2?  The three episodes here are Duct Soup, Blue and Beyond a Joke.  There are a few good moments, such as Kryten on the rampage in Jane Austin artificial reality.  But that, and throwing in GELFs, rogue simulants and mechanoids, can't make up for deadbeat scripts.  Thankfully Red Dwarf escaped the mire with the far superior Series 8.",1023494400,,893,4.746753246753247
7885185,3,6305196222,"I feel I have to put the record straight about Red Dwarf VII. I don't mean to sound arrogant, but I've studied Red Dwarf very closely over the years and regard myself as a super fan and expert. Forget other peoples opinion on Red Dwarf VII - this is the TRUE reflection.
Tikka To Ride-
Fantastic production values, lovely subtle character based humour (lacking for three or four series) mixed with a fantastic, thought provoking action based plot. Emotional music is superb. Nice start. 3/4
Stoke Me A Clipper -
WOW. One of the best episodes ever. Great send-off. The characters are more REAL in this episode than they've been for a long time. Memories of 'Thank's For The Memory' with Lister being noble to Rimmer. Some superb action sequences and an breathtaking CGI funeral scene. This episode is both hilarious and sad - absolutely fantastic entertainment. Easily one of the top five episodes ever. 4/4
Ouroboros -
Hard act to follow with bringing Kochanski into the mix, but this episode achieves that goal admirably. Some fans complained about Kryten's whingeing, but I say to them - watch series three - he does the same in both 'Polymorph' and 'Bodyswap'. Nice character moments and a fantastic chase scene. Kryten is really funny in this episode. Not a classic, but this is a standard Red Dwarf episode. 2.5/4
Duct Soup -
The whole start bit with the pipes is the comedy genius that we expect and the episode has the weakest plot in the history of the show. Other than that though, this episode has a wealth of successful moments. Lister going to toilet in the shower and other jokes are very funny. Some Lovely character moments and we get to learn about Kochanski's character. Not nearly as funny as Marooned but still touching dialogue. 2/4",1005091200,,1752,4.747540983606557
7885186,1,6305196222,"I can remember that night nearly a decade ago when I first saw the last few minutes of the episode ""D.N.A."" on my local PBS station.  It started a following of the show that has seen me buy every single video released.  I had been searching for a show to fill the void left by the departure of ""The Young Ones"" and I knew I had a winner in Red Dwarf.  The show peaked during seasons 3 and 4, but slipped a little in season 5.  Season 6 rebounded slightly, but not to it's previous high.  Season 7 started off well enough with Tape 1, but having the hindsight of Season 8, I can say without hesitation that this tape was the deathknell of the series.  Everything that made the first 4 series great, the idea of the dwarfers -vs- the universe, the friction of lister -vs- rimmer and kryten -vs- rimmer and cat -vs- rimmer plus the pure  comedy that drove the series is gone with rimmer's departure and Kochanski's arrival.  The tape is difficult to watch, it's that boring.  The script's suck and the humor is forced.  I was so glad to hear that Rimmer would be back for season 8 to make up for the abysmal season 7, but even his return is not enough to save this show which has strayed so far from it's beginning.  Someone should have done us all a favor and put a bullet in the head of Red Dwarf sometime before the ""Demons and Angels"" episode of Season 5.  Give me ""Backwards"" anyday.  At least I have my memories and my videotapes.",985392000,,1433,4.243542435424354
7885187,3,6305196222,"Here's where the absence of Chris Barrie is strongly felt. The tension between Kochanski and Kryten is no replacement for the intense relationship  of Lister and Rimmer that served as the basis for Red Dwarf for six  subsequent seasons.
Duct Soup is a good, not great, episode, examining  Kryten's insecurities about his relationship with Lister now that Kochanski  has arrived. The crew spend the night crawling around Starbug's service  ducts. I love the Cat's insensitivity concerning Lister's  claustrophobia.
Blue is fantastic. Blue is worth the price of this tape  alone. Lister is missing Rimmer, and missing him badly. Chris Barrie  appears in one of the funniest Red Dwarf scenes EVER. Complete with the  Arnold Rimmer munchkin song.
Beyond a Joke is pretty boring. It has a  moment of gold when Kryten hunts down the five Bartlett sisters from Pride  and Prejudice using a blowpipe and swinging logs. The rest of the episode  is pretty insipid, including a truly irritating 4000 mechanoid named Abel.
Please join me in a moment of silence as we honor the genius of Red  Dwarf. Although there are four tapes in the collection following this one,  we do not see the true brilliance that sparked Red Dwarf again.",967680000,2,1219,4.97029702970297
7885188,5,6305196222,"I love Red Dwarf, if just for introducing me to new colorful words like 'smeg' and 'git'. There's not much else to say that someone else hasn't already said...it's funny, it's witty, it's clever. Some of the 'British'  jokes (such as ones about the government or local geography) are lost on  me, but it in no way detracts from it.",953251200,2,331,4.5
