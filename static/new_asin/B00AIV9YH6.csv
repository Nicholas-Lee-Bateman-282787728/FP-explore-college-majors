5911501,5,B00AIV9YH6,"I was happy to see a movie that was so realistic.  Addiction is such a problem in this world, and this movie showed in great detail what addicts go through.  I would recommend this movie.  It kept my attention.  It made me laugh and cry! Good job!",1363824000,,247,4.191489361702128
5911502,5,B00AIV9YH6,"This movie was really good. Strong directing, the soundtrack was picked perfect, great acting especially from Gregory Smith and Shantel VanSanten. The two had great chemistry together.

I highly recommend this movie.",1360540800,,216,5.75
5911503,5,B00AIV9YH6,"It's been awhile since I saw the movie opening, so I can't comment on the specifics of greatness, but I remember this film was beautifully composed and entertaining from the first second to the last. The music was handpicked with care. It's real people going through the realness of life.",1358640000,5,288,4.78
8605057,4,B00AIV9YH6,"Better than most of the movies in the genre, especially at portraying the truth about inpatient rehab centers. In truth, especially in places where many of the ""patients"" are only there to avoid prison--for a while--the reality of predatory inmate/patients who prey upon vulnerable ones is inescapable, and the behavior is, if not rewarded, certainly not punished. That was one of the places where I had to suspecd my disbelief, as a young man with no legal problems and wealthy parents would be unlikely to spend his first rehab experience in a rehab that was basically a substitute for jail. He'd be much likelier to be in the ""Clean and Sober"" or ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" nice clean treatment centers with other patients who were nice ladies and gentlemen. Maybe his folks were just cheap.

I wasn't real sure about the ending. Was it reality or was it a dream? Since they showed the flashbacks of him with the one girl he was with when he overdosed the first time, and going into that dream world, I thought perhaps it was another dream sequence. If it was supposed to be reality, however, I again felt I had to suspend my disbelief. Generally people who have just come out of rehab are able to hold out a little longer. But, the truth is, that if they use, especially drugs like heroin or methadone, their tolerance will have been reduced by a month of two clean. If they use the same amount--and he'd overdosed once on this drug, whatever it was (probably supposed to be heroin) before he went to treatment--often they overdose on an amount they were able to do before.

A couple of other questions: What were he and his friend making in his friend's house? The only drugs that people, even those who know a little chemistry, make in their kitchens are crystal methamphetamine and a few designer drugs. Heroin and cocaine come from plants. I suppose it's possible they could have been purifying either, or processing black tar heroin into white heroin. I've never heard of anyone doing that in a home lab, though, so my guess is crystal meth. There's also fentanyl powder, but making black market fentanyl, which there is a lot of these days. However, nobody makes that in a home lab either. Last but not least, what did Molly overdose on when she shot up on the roof? It looked like a bottle of drain cleaner, but I can't imagine anyone wanting to die badly enough to shoot up drain cleaner. Do you know how painful that would be?

Altogether, a worthy effort, but with just a little bit more attention to detail, it could have been outstanding.",1510876800,,2554,4.5964912280701755
8605058,1,B00AIV9YH6,"Can you say stupid? You will if you watch this movie...stupid stupid, stupid",1508630400,,76,4.923076923076923
8605059,5,B00AIV9YH6,"IN MY POCKET is an accurate depiction of addiction and recovery. Addiction is an extremely dark place and incomprehensible to those who have never had the experience. This movie gives you a glimpse into this world... As a recovering addict myself, I know the challenges of the early stages of recovery. I did not relapse because I felt so much better without the drugs in my system. I self admitted to rehab and didn't realize how close I was to death. My addiction was precipitated by two brutal cervical spine surgeries that required a high level of pain medication. It is more common that you would think that addicts die if they relapse after treatment. They do not have the tolerance for the drug (particularly opiates) as they did in active addiction. They tend to return to the doses they used before they went to rehab. They no longer have the tolerance they had in active use and they overdose and die. It is advised that while in rehab friends or family members go through their residence to eliminate any drugs that might be remaining in their home. Unfortunately, that doesn't always happen....",1468540800,,1106,4.7357512953367875

8605061,1,B00AIV9YH6,Most implausible movie ever. I wish I had read the reviews on IMDB before wasting my money on this tripe.,1458691200,,105,4.3
8605062,4,B00AIV9YH6,"As someone who grew up with addiction all around me, in both my family and friends, IN MY POCKET was very believable and definitely showed how difficult it is to stay clean and sober, even with parental love and support, a loving girlfriend and a new lease on life! As sad as the ending was, I was actually glad that the filmmakers chose to end this way instead of having everyone ""live happily ever after"" because  the ending was much more true to life, unfortunately. All too often, people who are not educated about addiction and alcoholism think that if the addict goes to rehab or goes to a 12 step program that as soon as they come out of treatment, their problems will be over! It's really almost the opposite. Treatment interrupts the user or detoxes that person, but as soon as they get out, the ""real world"" problems are all still there and it's even more of a challenge to stay clean and sober once one does leave treatment. More often than not, what happened to ""Steven"" isn't that rare and this film did a good job of showing how easy it is to relapse and how easy it is to overdose, despite the addict's intention to stay abstinent. I have known a couple of people who did almost the exact thing that ""Steven"" did; they'd been clean for a few months, everything was going well and they happened to find a small amount of drugs in a pocket or their room, etc. and proceeded to do the same and ended up dead of an overdose. A sad, but very real, story.",1437264000,3,1464,4.343065693430657
