1432529,4,B00005JHBT,"This DVD has all the elements that would ear-mark it as a favorite for me.  Based on a classic novel, beautifully produced period piece, I'm a fan of the lovely Keeley Hawes who plays the lead.
  This production is superb in production values and an interesting story... so why only 4 stars?  Something is a bit off, and I just can't put my finger on it.  Partially it is that the characters portayed by Keeley Hawes and Greg Wise are not particularly likable, individually and/or together - perhaps chemistry is missing, too - but I just don't really care about their relationship.  There is something about the actor playing the dectective - a precursor to Hercule Poirot - that is a bit repulsive- not in a good way.  He makes me want to turn away from the screen... is it his seedy beard?  I dunno, but ick.
  The pace of the production is a little too slow in connecting the dots, so despite the fact that I like it and have watched it several times, my interest always flaggs towards the end.  The most interesting and compelling performance and plot element is the maid that has unrequited love for the leading man.  Since this is a 2 hour adaptation, we probably had a lot of details cut there, and it is too bad, because she is so sympathetic and has a very interesting back story.
  Like other Collins' stories, it is very dark in its view of the world, the upper class, and humanity.  But that lends more interest.
  The production just misfired somewhere.  There's just that something is missing, and it could very well be something that was something edited out of the book or on the cutting room floor.  So, I just can't give it 5 stars, but I am glad I have it, and it remains a good, solid BBC production of a classic detective yarn.",1142899200,8,1749,4.4263322884012535
1432530,4,B00005JHBT,"As always, a well-done film version of a mystery classic by Wilkie Collins: Keeley Hawes & Greg Wise were good choices for this film.  The storyline is entertaining and keeps you guessing: this story is not as well known as some other classics, but is entertaining and well-written in its own right.

It deals with a precious jewel called the Moonstone, bequethed to a young woman by her uncle on his death: the moment the Moonstone comes into the house where the young lady, Rachel Verinder, lives with her aunt, chaos ensues.  Rachel's childhood friend, now-grown Franklin Blake is the one delivering the stone: but mysterious Indians seem to follow the stone everywhere, and when it comes up missing, there seems to be no one to blame and Rachel refuses to point a figure.  So who exactly has taken the Moonstone, and will it ever be restored to its rightful owner?!

For those of you worried about content: the first scene in the film shows a man in bed with a woman (they are not married), they are sleeping; there is a small amount of violence; a character ends up committing suicide in the film; there are some tense moments & some lying, all in all the content is fairly minimal.

If you like mysteries, check out this great hauntingly beautiful film version of Wilkie Collin's ""The Moonstone""...",1132185600,71,1304,4.697368421052632
1432531,4,B00005JHBT,"Wilkie Collins's ""Moonstone"" was the earliest known detective novel, so it's inevitable that someone would have made a good adaptation of it: Suspense, superstitition, and suspicion are kept intact in the 1996 adaptation (soon to be on DVD). There are one or two casting flaws, but overall it is magnificently done.

During a battle in India, Colonel Sir John Herncastle stole the fabled Moonstone from a statue, and apparently brought down a curse on himself. Many years later, a young relative named Franklin Blake (Greg Wise) brings the Moonstone to the country manor of young Lady Julia (Patricia Hodge). But immediately things start to go wrong.

The Moonstone is stolen in the middle of the night, and everyone has an alibi. A mysterious band of Indian brahmins is hanging around. A house-maid, who is smitten with Franklin, commits suicide. And Lady Julia, who is suspected of stealing it herself, refuses to investigate further -- or to speak to Franklin. Desperate to know the truth, Franklin and the eccentric Sergeant Cuff (Antony Sher) try to unravel the mystery of the Moonstone....

Wilkie Collins wrote dozens of books and plays, but ""Moonstone"" is undoubtedly his best one. And for a Victorian-era novel, it's rather unprettified: drugs, mystical gems, conquerers, murder, and true love. It sounds like a bomb, but instead it's an entracing look at the dark side of that era of English history. The opening scene, where Franklin dreams of a murderous Sir John, is one of the most riveting (if a bit theatrical) scenes of the movie.

The darkness of the plot is in contrast to the beautiful surroundings -- lots of stately houses, ornate furniture and manicured gardens. Robert Bierman does an excellent job with the direction, slowly building up tension and suspicion. He does not skimp on personal details either, such as how the mysteries and crimes hang over everyone involved in the Moonstone.

Greg Wise is best known for his role as cad Willoughby in ""Sense in Sensibility,"" but he shows here that he can carry a movie very well. His Franklin is a bewildered innocent of sorts, and Hodge makes a strong female counterpart, who loves Franklin but doesn't believe him. The only weak link is Sher, whose character is too self-consciously quirky.

The inspector is too weird to be likable, but otherwise ""The Moonstone"" is a mystery that is still fresh after more than a century. Entrancing, bizarre and beautiful.",1125014400,21,2432,4.992592592592593

1432533,5,B00005JHBT,This follows the story line of the book fairly closely although there have to be some cuts to fit it into time.  The acting though is superb and please can we have this on dvd?,1115337600,8,176,4.0285714285714285
1432534,5,B00005JHBT,"I watched this video twice and found this is simply a superb adaptation of Wilkie Collins' classic novel, and the film succeeds not only in presenting the atomosphere of the original novel but in drawing the viewers into the complicated mystery about the missing stone, faith and betrayal, and secret love.

There are a lot of things in it, which a great mystery fans as well as avid readers of 19th century novels would relish; the brooding sinister-looking quicksand in the opening secne, a dashing hero and strong-willed heroine, a mysterious housemaid, and of course, the Moonstone, a cursed diamond which brings sudden unhappiness to a peaceful country house. As this beautiful diamond vanishes one night, a series of mysterious incidents ensues. Now enters the rose-loving detective Sgt. Cuff, and his investigation starts, but ... well, after that, please see what happens for yourself if you haven't read the origibal novel yet.

For those who have already read the novel, and know the plot from the beginning to the end, the way they adapted the original is so skillful that you will never feel disappointed. The spirit of Wilkie Collins' classic tale is preserved intact like the acclaimed Sherlock Holmes series featuring the late, great Jeremy Brett, and no unnecessary liberty was taken in the process of making it a film. Shot with visually fine production designs and based on good script which faithfully visualize the original, ""The Moonstone"" comes out as a winner, including first-rate cast. Greg Wise, after rather minor role in ""Sense and Sensibility,"" portrays the likable hero with good acting, and Keeley Hawes is a standout as the lovely but independent heroine who is not afraid of having her own will (a kind of a woman Collins loved to portray).  Minor characters are also given moments to shine, and even comic relief Miss Clack is no exception.

Of course, there are several changes done; for example, Mr. Candy is given another job of explaining something about the diamond, (which, by the way, he didn't do in the original novel), but those changes are all reasonable. And some scenes may look strange to the 21st century audiences (especailly how to locate the missing stone with some medical help), but after all the book was written more than 130 years ago, and we should accept these things as they are, shouldn't we?

So, to all fans of good, old-fahioned detective story and Victorian novels, this video is strongly recommended, and I hope you will enjoy watching it, as I did.",1003017600,126,2515,4.950236966824645
1432583,4,B00005JHBT,"Love Greg Wise, He is so handsome and even though this is an old movie it is still enjoyable.  This is one of Keely Hawes first movies and I liked her in it also.  They are both good .",1375056000,,184,3.6923076923076925
1432584,5,B00005JHBT,"After recently discovering the book by Wilkie Collins, I became much interested in the story and sought for a video.  This is the one I readily came across and was much pleased by a very tight and accurate portrayal all around.  The only thing I noticed amiss was that the Indian chest in which Ms. Rachel placed the stone was in her dressing room, not her bedroom proper.  She was standing at the door between the rooms watching Blake when he took it.  This presentation appears to present the chest in her bedroom and her watching from her bed.  I don't know why they changed that, as it is much less credible that he would pass her in obvious view and that she would reckon he did not see her, as she later stated.  However, overall, this is a gorgeous, effective presentation with excellent casting.",1373500800,2,803,4.503448275862069
1432585,4,B00005JHBT,"Originally broadcast by the BBC over the Christmas period in 1996, THE MOONSTONE is based on the classic Wilkie Collins novel, regarded as one of the first great detective stories.  Although this 2-part TV version cuts out many pertinent events from the original novel, it moves at a cracking pace and is quite entertaining when taken in the right spirit.

The ""moonstone"" in question is a priceless gem, stolen from a sacred Hindu temple by Sir John Herncastle (Terrence Hardiman), the black sheep of the Verinder family.  When he attempts to visit his niece Rachel (Keeley Hawes) on her birthday, he is politely turned away, but vows to never forget the girl or the present he has set aside for her.  On Rachel's 18th birthday, Franklin Blake (Greg Wise) finally presents Rachel with the gift from now-dead Herncastle - the moonstone gem.  During the ensuing night, however, the stone mysteriously disappears from Rachel's bedroom.  Franklin calls in London's esteemed Sergeant Cuff (Antony Sher), but he runs into nothing but roadblocks, culminating in Rachel, bewildered and angry, running back to London despite the protestations of Franklin, Cuff and her mother Lady Julia (Patricia Hodge).

A year passes, in which time Franklin has been completely estranged from Rachel, and the case, frustratingly, unsolved.  But a trail of new clues will soon emerge into the light, leading Franklin, Rachel and Cuff to the real culprit... but will they be too late to reclaim the moonstone?

Despite it's shortcomings, this MOONSTONE is quite enjoyable, and a lot of the credit must go to the cast.  Greg Wise (""Madame Bovary"", ""Cranford"") and Keeley Hawes (""Wives and Daughters"", ""Tipping the Velvet"") pair beautifully as Franklin and Rachel, and their scenes together are a delight.  Patricia Hodge adds a great deal of wry, pithy humour to Lady Julia, and Antony Sher is fantastic as the inspector.  The Verinder house is stocked with suspects including disturbed chamber maid Rosanna (Lesley Sharp) and her companion ""Limping Lucy"" (Elizabeth Berrington).

There is an earlier BBC miniseries from 1972 which I hope to see and compare soon, but in the meantime I can heartily recommend this 1996 production.",1337040000,2,2205,5.142857142857143

1432588,3,B00005JHBT,"Having just read the book, I found the movie somewhat tedious. The movie cuts a lot out but moves at a faster pace than the novel, which is overall a good move though at times I think it loses something in the editing. Not a lot of substance to it, but it's okay. If you've never read the book, it might be confusing or perhaps just more interesting because you don't know how it will end. Overall, it's a good movie but probably not one I'll watch again and again. I'd suggest renting it rather than buying it.",1213401600,3,511,4.224489795918367

1432590,5,B00005JHBT,"The moral of the story is certainly one difficult to argue, and this film adaptation of Wilkie Collins' book is fantastic with lush filming, beautiful homes, excellent acting and an intriguing plot. English aristocracy was known for ""correct"" behavior at all times. One's reputation was of utmost importance. Damage to one's reputation could ruin one's life and worse-- this is the foundation of the unlikely but entertaining mystery that is at the center of The Moonstone.

The characters are all well done and even the bizarre detective with his surety, sideburns, and affection for roses seems completely authentic. Both my husband and I enjoyed this film completely and recommend it highly.  English upper-crust society was very much about the keeping up of appearances. Everybody keeps their appearances in The Moonstone until things go very much astray. Excellent.",1206576000,9,870,5.343065693430657

1432592,3,B00005JHBT,"I was disappointed in this piece.  I was hoping for a romantic period piece that I could watch on rainy days, but that's not what I got.

It's does have a wonderful cast, with some recognizable faces who do a fairly good job.",1188172800,,303,4.679245283018868

Technically good in costumes, lighting, and attractive sets. If you like a light Whodunnit; you may like this. As good as anything on TV today.  The detective is interesting, and his sleuthing has some interest. The story holds your attention; therefore, maybe 3-stars for some people (I rate 2-stars, if I do not keep it to watch again years later).

5-star Mystery DVD's are: ""Road to Avonlea-Season 3"",  episode: ""A Dark and Stormy Night"", starring Christopher Reeve; or the modern, clever, murder-mystery series ""Columbo"", Seasons 1-7 & ""Columbo Murder Mystery 1991-1993""; or ""Sherlock Holmes"" starring Basil Rathbone; or the ""Original Nancy Drew Movie Mystery Collection"" 1936, starring Bonita Granville.

All the actors did a superb job --- absolutely sincere, sympathetic, and believable.  Also, the settings are beautiful.  I just love lush English countryside and glorious country houses.  So, visually, the piece has a lot to offer.  The story is a tiny bit naive, but no more so than the Sherlock Holmes stories -- modern realism doesn't come into it.

1432621,4,B00005JHBT,"The ""Moon Stone"" is a really good Victorian Detective story.  Its setting, script and acting are all splendid.  Each of the characters is portrayed by a great British character actor some that I've seen many times in other British presentations.  I especially liked the detective as played by Antony Sher.

Anthony Sher plays a Sherlock Holmes type of detective that has been somewhat imitated down through the years-by Colombo, Frost, Morse, etc.  He's a little cranky, somewhat disheveled and prone to idiosyncrasies (in his case humming and smelling Roses) but he, of course, gets the job done after some false leads.

I have not read the book; therefore, I won't do the comparison thing.  Nevertheless, if you are into good detective stories (especially ones that are set in the Victorian era, infused with opium, mystery and quicksand plus with a quirky detective) buy this DVD.

7938789,4,B00005JHBT,"Initially aired by the BBC during the Christmas season back in '96, Robert Biermans The Moonstone bases upon the classic novel by Wilkie Collins. In spite of its brevity, leaving out several pivotal scenes from the original novel, the film does move at a proficient pace and is surely enjoyable when viewed with consideration to the fact that it is an adaptation. There are some minor alterations; for instance, Dr. Candy is given the task of offering further explanation concerning the diamond on the night of the theft (an incident not found in the novel), but such changes are within reason. It is likely as well that certain scenes from the film might appear unusual to modern day viewersparticularly when the mystery is nearly solved through Franklin Blake's deliberate use of opiumbut in all fairness the use of opium was a common yet unspoken practice for the treatment of painful illnesses during the Victorian period.

Tensions and suspicions gradually increase between major characters, and the films cast must be given praise for this crescendo. Keeley Hawes and Greg Wise work strikingly well together as Rachel Verinder and Franklin Blake, and their chemistry is a pleasure to watch. Patricia Hodge gives a great deal of nipping and keen comicality to her character Lady Verinder, and Anthony Sher plays Inspector Cuff decorously as well. Sher's performance portrays Cuff as an irritable and rather ruffled inspector who although has his own peculiaritiessniffing roses and randomly hummingultimately solves the case. One of the most attention-grabbing characters depicted in the film is the maid Rosanna Spearman (Lesley Sharp) and her unreciprocated love for Franklin. Being that the film carries for just two hours, much of the significant details of her character are regrettably cut out. An unfortunate abbreviation considering her compassionate character and intriguing personal history.

Despite its limitations as a two hour adaptation, the film is fascinating in its interactions between the cast and their particular setting. The plot alone has a darkened tone dark in comparison to its bright and decorated environment. A backdrop of exquisitely crafted houses filled with elaborate fixtures, and surrounded by well-tended gardens makes the bizarre turn of events within the story all the more compelling to view. Within the margins of time allotted to its production, this film portrays an artistically perceptive view of the classic Wilkie Collins novel The Moonstone.",1417737600,,2494,5.343511450381679
