8494207,5,B0066PSPQ4,"""East Meets West"" is great a great way to introduce more people to the topic of oriental medicine and it allows them hear what experts have to say about it.  Personally I found it refreshing to hear so many people voice their opinions on the matter of forming a new health care system in America. While in depth, this is still an easy way to understand eastern medicine for those who don't know much about the subject.

This film has taught me a lot about the ancient traditions of Chinese medicine - something I had formerly known very little about. Jennifer Buys shows everyday, regular people that this form of medicine can be useful to all of us. Her intention is to have us compare ourselves to the other side of the world and see how some of the things they're doing could benefit us if we'd let them.

I had never really payed much attention to acupuncture and the other traditions involved in Chinese medicine until I saw this film and it taught me that oriental medicine has helped many people in a fascinating way. Buys, and the experts in her film, explain their opinions on fusing the two worlds of medicine together in an intriguing way that made me reconsider traditional western medicine. I recommend this film to everyone I know and anyone looking into the topic.",1330300800,3,1279,4.576419213973799

The film, East meets West, provides a very clear and succinct explanation of the fundamentals of Chinese Medicine: how it works, what it is useful for, and why it is a wonderful complement to western medicine. The film demystifies Chinese medicine in an informative, interesting, and easy to watch way.
