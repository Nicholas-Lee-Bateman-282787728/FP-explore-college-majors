8675554,5,B00N1BNN68,"I bought this Comprehensive Beginner Chess Course for my kids. My son is 7 years old and he really likes Damian Lemos. We have him watch the video with a physical tournament size chessboard and chess pieces in front of him, and while Damian goes through the game on the computer, my son moves the pieces on the board at the same time. Damian goes through the videos at a perfect, consistent, moderate, pace and he explains every single move; thus, my son has time to move the pieces while watching, and my son understands the ideas/thought processes behind every single move. I note that many other chess teachers are OK to watch without a chessboard, but with a chessboard its difficult, because they often go too fast and its not possible to move the pieces on the physical board fast enough to keep up; moreover, they often assume the viewer sees moves they do, so they don't explain moves or variations. You will not have these issues with Damian. My daughter is 9 and she just started Lemoss beginners series and today she said Damian Lemos makes studying chess enjoyable, and at 9:30PM my daughter on her own initiative got out her chess board and did a Damian Lemos video. To summarize: My kids enjoy watching Damian because of his moderate pace, his explanations/ideas about every single move, and because they actually learn from Damian, while other videos my kids would just go through the motions without understanding.",1409011200,2,1430,4.746987951807229
