8584122,5,B00COTZSOS,"Ah, Charles Band. The master of low budget horror with a cast of demonic creatures and barely-talented actors. This film is so-bad-it's-good. Anna Sophia Berglund is easy on the eyes and quite enjoyable in this film. Basically, a quasi-Leprechaun figure -- more sympathetic than scary -- and other creatures get involved in a talent/beauty reality show being filmed at a mansion in Los Angeles. It's all pretty low budget, oddly-paced, and poorly acted, but somehow it's just a guilty pleasure, empty-calorie, enjoyable film. A deluxe version of this DVD came with a Lucky Charms the cereal-esque ripoff cereal (grain and colored marshmallows), which I thought was cool (if ultimately perishable (?)). (This isn't that product.) If you like horror-comedy, hot but ditzy women, cheap CGI, and so-bad-they're-good films, this may be your Citizen Kane. A cult classic in the making, I suspect.",1488499200,2,890,5.274647887323944
8584123,4,B00COTZSOS,I love those five pretty girls. Great cheap effects. I like those weird looking leprechauns. I do like some Full Moon films. And it wasn't that long.,1486771200,2,149,4.555555555555555

8584127,1,B00COTZSOS,"I had a real problem going into this film when I first rented it because I was expecting more among the lines of Troll or Leprechaun, but ended up getting nothing even remotely resembling either one of them.  The main antagonist (or so you'd think from the cover) mischievous Farr Darrig is practically a good guy until he's ordered to kill and even then he's not convincing because it's like the director was going in all ""half-assed"" on his character.  Speaking of which, he's got a few buddies (the Cyclops, Banshee, etc) to help out, but they're in the same boat and most of the time they only do so much, other then the part Cyclops possessing one of the girls (Masuini Max) for a little T&A, but once that tease is over, so is practically the point of this whole movie.

I'll just try to phrase this simple.  The monsters are barely doing what they should be doing and the actors along this idea they're in a reality program (something of the process we really need to start phasing out, like 3 years ago) couldn't act their way out of a lifeboat in the middle of a hostage situation.  Does anyone remember ""Skinemax?""  Show a little tit, spend the rest of the time boring the hell out you because that's exactly what this movie is.  If I had a chance myself, I'd take everything about this film, crinkle it up, throw it in a trash bin and top it off with a Molotov cocktail because it's deserving of such.  The only thing worth saving is that mischievous Farr Darrig character on which I would just reboot him and forget this movie ever existed.  Such wasted potential.

Oh and Masuini, your doctor did a pretty good job on ya.",1394323200,2,1634,4.434782608695652
8584128,2,B00COTZSOS,"I haven't seen many Full Moon productions so I cannot compare this movie to any others. I found the cattiness from the girls...so ""realistic"".  I find Piril (Seth Peterson) rather comical and almost ""catty"" himself.  Charlie O'Connell's character was so sleezy and over the top...somewhat ""realistic"" as a producer in the ""biz"". I did find the story kinda ""holey"" at times, it reminded me of the classic movie ""Leprechaun"" but I think it might have been just the ""accents"".  I would consider this movie more as a rental than an own.",1384992000,,532,4.824175824175824
8584129,1,B00COTZSOS,Im a big fullmoon fan! But for the past 15 years there movies have been a lil too cheap! And most are crap! Unlucky charms is a 65 min long crapfest! Its cheap.  Its dull. The playboy playmate is the only good thing cuz shea hot! Jerry oconnell is good too. But fullmoon keeps getting worse eacg year. They make about 3the movies per year and maybe 1the will be good. Wish charles band would make 2 movies per year so the budget would be a lil bigger for both films. Instead of making 3 or 4like cheap crap films a year. Give us 2tge good ones. And for tge luv of god.....MAKE A TRANCERS SEQUEL WITH TIM. AND SUNSPECIES.AND DOLLMAN ETC. the films that made fullmoon big.not these lil crappy movies. Puppet master series is complelty dead after the last 4 movies. (There so bad) just stop makin puppet master please! One more fullmoon film this year. Gingerdead man vs evil bong lol. Iit may be good. Then next year the grim rapper! How dumb!  Stat away from unlucky charms! And please start RELEASING MOVIES NEW AND OLD ON BLU RAY.,1375747200,,1031,4.364583333333333
8584130,2,B00COTZSOS,"A group of five girls are in an old mansion competing in a modeling/spokesperson competition for reality TV. Characters from the underworld are summoned to the surface by an unknown person (mystery is short lived) to kill off the models. These include a cyclops and what appears to be a Scottish Leprechaun.

The film is a nice concept with potential. Indeed, I was thinking of cult classic ""Evil Toons."" However, it didn't live up. The dialouge was simplistically catty. The humor didn't take and it really needed to because there was no real horror factor.

The opening to the film informs us that Full Moon productions has created its own interactive streaming web site for $6.99 a month, ""only 20 cents a day"". Closer to 23 cents a day for you third grade scholars. 70 minutes long and even as a cheap rental, it still might be worth passing up even with Masuimi's tats and cool under garments.
