2230256,4,B0007PCDNU,I liked this movie about the legendary track star Jesse Owens. It shows the struggles that he went through to reach success. I do recommend it.,1354579200,,143,4.538461538461538
2230257,5,B0007PCDNU,"The recent political triumph of Barak Obama, forcefully makes me to remind those first and if you may epic efforts of so many sportsmen who made the best hey could in order to make them feel and respect as human beings.

Jesse Owens was the epitome of the resistance, a true gladiator, a lavish Ambassador who demolished in front of Hitler the coveted dreams of beating the record in 1938. That political slap on the face would be the first of many and successive historical mournful and successful events around many activities, sharp thinkers, eloquent leaders, talented jazz musicians, famed classic pianists, remarkable soul stars, exceptional opera's singers, businessmen, doctors, movie actors, boxers that paved the way and materialized that well reminded maxim ""I have a dream.""",1225843200,4,786,5.188976377952756
2230258,5,B0007PCDNU,"The film begins in a federal courtroom later in Jesse's life. He pleads 'no contest' to not filing income taxes for four years. As part of the normal sentencing process (up to four years in prison and $40,000 in fines), the judge assigns a probation officer to meet with Jesse and put together a history of his life and accomplishments. This begins the life story of perhaps the greatest modern day Olympic athlete told through a series of flashbacks and interviews with people who knew him well. It has the feel of a docudrama at times. It's a fascinating story and like so many, there is a person who played a key role at a critical time in his life. In this case, it was a Jr. High coach who saw the potential and persuaded Jesse to come out for the team. He had practice alone for Jesse before school because Jesse had to work every day after school to help support his family of nine brothers and sisters and a father who could not find work. It's an incredible life and one in which there was much struggle despite the amazing talent he had for running. Being poor and black in the U.S. in the 1920's and 30's is not the recipe for success. For all his success he remained humble throughout his life and had a difficult time saying no to any individual or organization that needed his help. The film dispels several myths that developed about the 1936 Olympics and Owens and Hitler. While the film is on the long side (174 minutes) and a little grainy in places I never was bored. One of the great sports stories of the 20th century with lots of great clips of Jesse competing, you will want to see the end to learn why Jesse avoided taxes for those four years. You may even shed a tear or two at the end. By the way, the silver medalist in the 100 meter dash was Mac Robinson whose brother Jackie became the first black Major League Baseball player 11 years later. Whenever Jesse encountered someone who didn't agree with him or was being resistant, he would say, ""Let's take a walk. If we walk long enough and talk long enough, we might begin to understand each other."" I know some politicians who need to hear those words. Come to think of it, not bad advice for all of us.

2230259,4,B0007PCDNU,"My family and I really enjoyed this DVD of The Jesse Owen's Story.  The movie is a little dated (1984), but well worth watching and experiencing.  It clearly and honestly portrays the life of this outstanding man - how he came to be an Olympian champion, and all that he went through after his success in the Olympics.  The DVD is quite long (almost 3 hours) and does not have scene selections, so don't stop it once you are started.  This story inspired me to work at being a quality individual ... like Jesse Owens.",1211932800,8,517,4.410526315789474
2230260,4,B0007PCDNU,EXCELLENGT MOVIE. SQUARES WITH WHAT I DO KNOW. NOT ONLY IS IT INTERTAINING AND ENJOYABLE BUT THERE IS A LOT TO LEARN.,1211846400,4,117,4.363636363636363
2230261,4,B0007PCDNU,"Jesses lets people call him Jesse instead of JC becuase he does not want to cause trouble.  I admired that he focused on the job that needed to be done and did not worry about being black.

A German athlete observes Jesse help a Mexican athlete do better.  Later, the German athlete helps Jesses when he realizes that the judges attempt to DQ Jesses for jumping too late.

A couple scenes are out of context because they show people in a spotlight with no background.

Much of the move takes place after the Olympics.",1189209600,4,517,4.457446808510638
2230262,5,B0007PCDNU,"I was deeply moved by this film that captures the reality of what one of the greatest of our countrymen went through.  Much misunderstood throughout history, but cleared up in this film, Jessie Owens is an example that is just as needed today as ever.  We owe a great deal to people that lived when he did, suffered in the North like he did, and paved the way for countless others to follow.  His faults are honestly shown here, but we need to remember that when he came to prominence it was not like it is today.  He ""paid his dues"" in full!!!",1168300800,14,544,4.252427184466019
2230263,5,B0007PCDNU,This is one of the films I seen. It has good information that discusses about the late Olympic great Jesse Owens. I think everybody should see this film 'cuz it's a classic. Good acting and good quality to it.,1104105600,3,209,4.384615384615385
2230264,4,B0007PCDNU,Jesse Owens is a Hero.he stood Hate in the Face&Looked it down and was a Champion not only of Sport but of Human Rights. Dorian Harewood a Good Actor who i have seen in countless films does a solid job here.,952214400,13,207,4.073170731707317
2230265,1,B0007PCDNU,Very poor decision to use income tax evasion to tell the story of one of Americas greatest athletes ever.,1462579200,,105,4.578947368421052
2230266,5,B0007PCDNU,"Wonderful movie.
Jesse Owens had an inner strength, a God given Strength, that truly every human, no matter where they live on this planet, has.  Jesse showed that it mattered not what the world thought or did, he moved forward, acting in accord to his inner drive.
In the end, he stood up to the unconstitutional threat of paying taxes on your own abilities.  He didn't understand ""why"" .. until he looked back on his life.  In the end he realized .. ""I already paid my dues"".  What a hero!",1458950400,,491,4.4222222222222225
2230267,3,B0007PCDNU,"The Jesse Owens Story deserves to be told, but despite some solid acting and the fun of watching some old clips, this movie drags.  It is nearly three hours (174 minutes), runs as slow as molasses (Jesse was a lot faster!), and could have done with better writing and editing. The director could have ensured points of dramatic tension, but despite a story ripe for these points (the '36 games, the income tax trial, etc.), the pace was so desultory that dramatic tension did not build or come off. Jesse Owens' story is so wonderful, it almost comes off, but doesn't.",1458086400,,568,4.623762376237623
