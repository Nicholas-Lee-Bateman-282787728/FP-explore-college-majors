8661249,4,B00KT6OVNM,Not action packed. Documentary style. Gives great perspective of what it's like roughing it in the Amazon. For outdoorsy types.,1466726400,,127,5.4
8661250,1,B00KT6OVNM,"Not great.  90 minutes of David eating catered food and sleeping in a hammock. Very little actual motorcycle riding and what motorcycle riding there was was mostly in the streets of Rio.  The movie is very miss leading. The trailer and description make it seem as though he rides a motorcycle into the depths of the amazon to a remote village when in actuality he is mostly flying in a plane or on a boat or driven around in a car. When they get to their  guides home they all complain that nobody told them that they would have to ride a whole 5 (five) miles on a dirt road.
If you want to see a good documentary about riding a motorcycle to exotic and remote locations check out Ewan McGregors Long Way Round.",1435104000,5,711,4.291044776119403
