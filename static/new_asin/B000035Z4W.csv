This video keeps my 15 month old's attention like nothing else.  He dances to the fast paced, colorful screen.  He has been watching it since he has been about 6 months old, and has only grown to love it more.  It has some extra Disney songs at the end, which he also enjoys.  This was the best gift anyone ever got him, (and me.)",993859200,2,473,4.164835164835165
