7900033,5,7810441906,"I am from Salisbury, NC but have lived in Chapel Hill and Durham, NC for most of my life. Throughout this time I have interacted with many people in Durham- particularly in not-so-great areas of the city. Durham is a very unique city and is not all bad. The film displays this in a way that makes it quite interesting to learn about. Needless to say, there is a lot of drug dealing and violent crime going on here. The first time I saw this documentary was when I was taking a sociology class at Durham Technical CC and we watched this back in 2007. Since then I have become more and more aware about what really goes on in Durham and surrounding area. Per capita it has one of the highest murder rates in the country as well as a lot of drug dealing and crime. The documentary focuses primarily on gangsters, dealers, police, working folk, and people that have seen the cycle full circle. It has hard to explain the feeling one gets as they become more familiar with Durham, NC in person. This documentary at least puts you there in a sense- you can get a feel of what the average person there goes through and sees on a daily basis, as well as sides of the law enforcement and criminals. I rate this 5 stars because it is an extremely well-done documentary with a dope soundtrack and it is not boring. ""God damn I found Brooklyn in the South"" -- Big Daddy Kane song ""Welcome 2 Durham"" - that quote sums up Durham. This is also a very rare film and quite expensive to find new or in like new condition. I was lucky to get mine with soundtrack for $22 shipped. If you can get a copy for less than $30 I would highly advise as I believe it is discontinued.",1374624000,,1655,4.2405063291139244
