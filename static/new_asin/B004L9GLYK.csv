4400925,4,B004L9GLYK,"Being a huge fan of South Korean cinema (""The Host"", ""Old Boy"", ""A Tale Of Two Sisters"", ""Bedevilled"", ""Natural City"", ""Save The Green Planet"", ""Mother"", ""Memories Of Murder"", ""Secret Sunshine"", ""Phone"", ""The Isle"", ""I'm A Cyborg But That's Ok"", ""Haeundae"", ""Conduct Zero"", ""Bunshinsaba"", ""Samaritan Girl"", ""3-Iron"", ""Hansel & Gretel"", ""The Red Shoes"" and many, many more.), I am happy to say that ""Chaw"" delivered exactly what I was expecting: quirky fun with some monster action spliced in. The Police Chief dude that keeps asking for his club is absolutely hilarious! The blu-ray transfer is very nice. The film is just mindless fun with some interesting characters. Kudos to Magnolia/Magnet for picking up this film. I REALLY HOPE THEY PICK UP ""Bedevilled"" next for a blu-ray release.",1316649600,7,788,5.261904761904762
4400926,2,B004L9GLYK,"I found myself waiting for this film to end about 20 minutes into it.
It was bogged down by silly Korean slapstick that wasn't very funny,and it took quite awhile to establish a storyline.

The characters were uninteresting and some most unnecessary. Although there were a couple of characters that I did like,it wasn't enough. The gore factor was virtually non existent and that's usually one reason we watch giant marauding creature flicks.

The pro is that the monster effect was quite good but you can't get into a movie just because the creature effect is good,there has to be some sort of motivation to keep you watching be it storyline,interesting and likable characters or even ""good"" comedy which I felt there was none of the above. I was really looking forward to it because I saw Pig Hunt and really enjoyed that giant killer Boar film. I say skip this one and watch Pig Hunt,you won't have to read subtitles either,and I just watched ""The Man From Nowhere and loved every minute of it subtitles and all,so I have no problem reading them for if the film is good.",1303776000,7,1073,4.6421052631578945
4400927,4,B004L9GLYK,"I purchased a Korean DVD of this movie last year and thoroughly enjoyed it. It doesn't measure up to The Host in sfx or plot but is a fun popcorn monster on the loose romp. There is the usual Korean-style humor throwm in with a cast of characters you've seen in most modern creature on the loose productions: earnest/troubled young hero, cute female scientist, crusty wise old expert, brash hunter, etc. Better than a Syfy Channel cgi monster of the week with good actors, adequate if not spectacular sfx, and a tried and true plot.",1303257600,4,532,4.610526315789474

8433985,4,B004L9GLYK,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of Chawz by Magnolia Home Entertainment

***IMPORTANT***: This movie is not in English but you can watch it with English subtitles.

This movie was surprisingly good. I didn't think I would like it very much but I was wrong. I was actually tempted to give it 5 stars but I can't say that it is 5 star good. It just always seems like movies are better than what they are when your expectations are low. There is lots of humor. In a way it sort of reminded me of another South Korean film, 'The Host.' Not that the two are similar other than a creature killing people. It's the approach to the movie that is similar....the way they used humor during serious situations.

BLU-RAY DVD: The quality is decent but not 4k beautiful like some of the newer blu-ray DVD's. The colors often seemed washed out and the lighting is nothing to write home about. I'm not sure how much of a difference there is between the blu-ray and standard DVD.

EXTRA'S: Lots of extra's on this disc. They are:
3 Making of Chawz featurette's
Deleted Scenes
Q & A Session Premiere Event
Blooper Reel
International Trailer

PLOT/SUMMARY: Police Officer Kim Kang-soo is reassigned from a big city(Seoul) to a small town that supposedly has no crime (it's an ongoing joke). The police that are in this town are completely incompetent and the head of police provides lots of comic relief throughout the movie as he attempts to delegate jobs to his inferiors, especially those jobs he doesn't wish to do himself (which is just about everything). Officer Kim moves to the small town along with his pregnant wife and his mother who is mentally ill. His mother is in the movie for the purpose of providing a lot more comic relief. Her mental illness leads to many comical situations. Officer Kim arrives and meets the town chief, Kim Gi-cheon. From him he learns of an organic food fair that is going to take place shortly. He also learns of some strange animal attacks that have taken place recently. Soon we meet Detective Shin, another officer who's mother has gone missing, a biologist, and Chun Il-Man, an old timer whose granddaughter is missing.
Once everyone realizes that a giant man-eating boar is on the loose they hire hunters to come and kill the beast. We also learn that there is more than one boar, perhaps a family? It's up to everyone to stop the beast(s) and allow the organic fair to proceed!

THOUGHTS: I thought 'Chawz' was very well done. There were a few slow parts but overall it is very good. I especially like the special effects. When I first caught glimpses of the giant boar I thought it was going to look cheezy in a pre-cgi sort of way. But I was in for a pleasant surprise. The giant boar looked quite good. It is very realistic looking and you will see it many times and out in the open. There is no hiding poor special effects here.
The first half of the movie was very funny. The town chief, chief of police and the mentally ill mom all provide lots of laugh's. Unfortunately the second half of the movie loses it's sense of humor. Also the movie start's to get a bit repetitious. The boar attacks all seem similar and you see the same sort of scenes such as when they boar tries to change direction....his feet slide as he tries to turn and this effect is used multiple times.

I don't normally complain about movies being too long but I felt that this movie was 15-20 minutes too long for the material they had.

Overall....job well done. Not perfect but still 4 stars good.

Recommended for any fan of South Korean movies. Also recommended for anybody who likes The SyFy Channels killer animal/reptile/fish movies.",1464307200,,3654,4.566412213740458

8433989,1,B004L9GLYK,I guess I was expecting a better movie because of the DVD cover. The 1st 15-20 minutes were alright. I LOVED the slapstick & I couldn't keep myself from laughing but after awhile it just gets boring. Chawz had a Sci Fi Channel feel to it & I wouldn't be suprised if it showed up on their channel in the future. I'd tell you to go watch it if you're into these type of flicks but if you're not then I'd tell you don't bother,1432080000,,423,3.988235294117647

Watch it; buy iy.",1384560000,,262,4.822222222222222
