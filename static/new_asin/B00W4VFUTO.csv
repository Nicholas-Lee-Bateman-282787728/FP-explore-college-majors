I was kept in suspense from the beginning until the very last minute when the killer was revealed   A brilliant thriller will loads of suspense, nail-biting scenes, intense scenes and ANGST. I watched it twice already & will watch it again :)",1473897600,,280,4.56
8712143,4,B00W4VFUTO,"I have to rectify the terrible injustice that this movie has only 1 star by 2 reviewers. I watched this movie because I was on an airplane and the guy in front of me was watching it on his screen with the English subtitles on-- it was so engrossing that I couldn't help but get sucked in despite the fact the tiny screen was so far away and I could not hear the sound. By the first plot point I realized I had to watch it start to finish. So I asked the flight attendant what movie it was.  She unhelpfully told me 'it's an Indian movie' as though that meant I would lose interest. No, not at all. Scrolling past the Mission Impossible, Jurassic World, and (reluctantly) Love and Mercy, I finally hit upon what turned out to be Rahasya--a neo-noir murder mystery with a Mumbai setting, layers of complexity, occasional humor and more than a little tragedy that I recommend for any fan of the genre.",1447545600,,898,4.345238095238095
8712144,1,B00W4VFUTO,Really disappointed that Amazon couldn't let us know the dialogue is NOT in English. I'd read that this is a really good movie but unwatchable with sub titles,1445472000,,158,4.678571428571429
8712145,1,B00W4VFUTO,"Not a single fact shown is accurate.

And everything is terrible about it apart from the cast and acting. The cast and acting are good. The story and everything else is false and horrible.

The director should learn a thing or two from his competition.",1445299200,,252,4.5777777777777775
