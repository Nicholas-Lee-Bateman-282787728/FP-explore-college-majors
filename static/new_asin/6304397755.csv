7869744,5,6304397755,"This is a true video documentary to the art of bel canto by the all time  specialist in that reportoire, Dame Joan Sutherland. The great Australia  diva pays homage to the most famous Prima Donnas of the past and interprets  a few of the many bel cantos show stoppers in her own incomparable and  immitatable vocal style.
In opening, she sings ""Qui la voce...Vien,  diletto"", the mad scene from Bellini's I Puritani, simply exquisitely,  there can be no criticism for her command of her extraordinary lyric  instrument. In particular, pay attention to her execution of the many  downward chromatic scales in rapid succession up to high D flat. In fact  she sings Elvira's mad scene even better than she did for her best selling  ""The art of the Prima Donna"" album that she recorded for the then  London Records about 40 years ago. She finishes ""Vien diletto"" on  a top E flat in alt, flawless, of course.
Next, La Stupenda, as she was  firstly given that title by the Venetians after her stunning 1960 Alcina,  attacks the tour de force, ""Bel Raggio...Dolce pensiero"" from  Rossini's Semiramide. I found not one fault vocally in the interpretation  of this coloratura showpiece, crowned with a ringing high E flat. Then  comes two lovely duets, one from Donizetti's Don Pasquale, and another from  Bellini's La Sonnambula that Ms Sutherland sings beautifully, if not given  much support from her anemic sounded tenor.
Following the duets is  Benedict's ""The Gypsy and the Bird"", a favorite encore piece sung  by many of the coloratura assolutas of the past. It is a bird song, really,  but not giving Dame Joan much of a vocal challenge. Then comes ""Io non  sono piu l'Annetta"" from Ricci's Cripsino E La Compare. This is one of  Sutherland most performed arias because of the ease that she makes of the  trills, arpeggios and high notes.
But without question, the highlight of  this entire collection is a flawlessly sung ""Ah, forse lui...Sempre  libera"" from Verdi's La Traviata. This aria is what Dame Joan  Sutherland is all about...perfect technique, perfect execution of all vocal  demands, and just, ravishing, ravishing singings as always, including a  gleaming high E flat that she nails at the end of the aria. Also take  notice to the great ease that the diva shows in her execution of the  impossibly high tessitura. In this reviewer's opinion, there are no better  interpretations out there of any of the arias that Dame Joan chose to sing  in this collection, but never is that more apparent than ""Sempre  libera"". There are only a few Prima Donna Assolutas in living memory  who can even come remotely close to this, and we all know who they were...
In all, a stupendous collection by La Stupenda.",968371200,3,2712,4.832244008714597
7869745,5,6304397755,"Since the first reviewer wanted a Callas point of view on this Tape I will  give my honest opinion. First and foremost I am a diehard Callas fan. I  believe that Callas had the best vocal technique and dramatic intelligence  that not even Caballe or Tebaldi could ever dream of having even in her  later years. Yet, she never possesed the lovely lyric voice that Joan  Sutherland had. Her agility soars well above any I have ever heard of or  will ever hear of again. Her e flat come out of her like hit a key on a  piano yes that simple. She will go down in history as the best voice of the  20th century. My highest recommendation for this Tape.",968284800,35,647,4.245901639344262
7869746,5,6304397755,"Sutherland is at her youthful best in these bel canto selection. To put it plainly, you will not hear these aria sung any better by anyone else. Only  Callas can be compared to the young Joan Sutherland, and even Callas would  have to hand it to Joan when it comes to the technical ease and precision  that La Stupenda bring to Bellini, Rossini and Donizetti.
Listen to  Sempre Libera, she attacks all the high notes with big brilliant tones. The  coloratura doesn't even seem hard for her. All she does is open her mouth  and all that sound comes out, up to E flat. Unbelievable. I like the  Semiramide aria even better, the fioratura is fabulous and again she goes  to top E flat. Then there's the Qui la voce. Again, the voice is free and  floating, the coloratura effortless as it should be, and again she goes to  high E flat.
So many fans would swear that the 1982 Lucia that Joan did  for the met is the last word in bel canto singing..NO WAY. What many fans  don't know is that great as dame Joan was in 1982, it's a whole different  voice twenty years earlier. If 1982 was a 10 voice, then 1962 was a 10 x 2  voice. That's how much better she was 20 years ago. And she kept that shape  until around 1976 and that spendid Elvira in I Purtani that she and  Pavorotti did for the Met. Then I don't know what happened, because every  year she got worse, and gradually lost the steady voice that she had for  many decades.
This recording is golden. But also I recommend the Bell  Telephone hour volumn 1 and 2. And the Firestone one also. Those tapes are  also from 1961 to 1968. And what a bell song Joan sang in a 1967 Bell  telephone hour selection. And in the Firestone one, a resounding Soldier  tir'd that even surpass the one she sang for the Legendary ""Art of the  Prima Donna"" CD. But the absolute highlight of those performance is a  stunning Hamlet mad scene from 1961 with coloratura that even makes this  recording sound tame, and she goes to high F in the Hamlet mad  scene.
Anyway, anything that Dame Joan did before the key year of 1977  will be nothing short of stupendous. She continued to be valid until as  late as 1982, but everything after that is just not the Sutherland sound  anymore.
This tape deserve a rating of ten.",966211200,,2248,4.323741007194244
7869747,5,6304397755,"This fascinating video preserves for posterity the voice and art of Joan Sutherland in her prime. In 1963, Sutherland is just dazzling with her flexible passagework, luminous high notes (up to E flat on this video) and  her perfect trill, perhaps the best of any singer. Sutherland graces with  her unique gifts arias and duets from I Puritani, Semiramide, La  Sonnambula, Don Pasquale, Crispino e la Comare and La Traviata, and also  sings the Gypsy and the Bird by Benedict. The performances are all staged,  with the nice support of the tenor Richard Conrad for the duets from  Sonnambula and don Pasquale. Sutherland refers continually to legendary  singers like Patti, Melba, Galli-Curci et al as her predecessors. When you  hear this incredible performances you do not have other option but to agree  that she in the same category as the great prima donnas of the past.",948672000,32,875,4.938356164383562
7869748,5,6304397755,"I started my interest in opera with Tebaldi. When Sutherland came along, I then followed both. This tape is magnificent!  In '63, Sutherland was hitting her stride and it's wonderfully audible here. How she hits those  high notes with seeming ease, always leaves me gasping. The only things  wrong with this tape are: it's too short and doesn't rewind fast enough to  be played again, and again, and again.  Simply beautiful! This was first  time I had heard Sutherland perform ""E Strano"" from Traviata. I  must admit that  I found myself thinking; ""Oh, THAT's the way that's  supposed to sound.""  This die-hard Tebaldi fan had to admit that  Sutherland does ""E Strano.."" better.  The contents of the rest of  tape fall squarely in the Bel Canto - Coloratura reportoire.  I would be  interested in opinion from Callas fan. Well worth the price.  Wow! What a  voice!",944784000,41,865,4.815068493150685
