8571669,5,B00BNKMRJ8,"I picked up on this guy on Pandora, I think.  Very similar to Go Go Penguins with a strong jazz, rock, classical combination that I cant get enough of these days.  They appear to be relatively unknown to this classic venue, occupying the midnight slot in the program.  With more than a dozen pitch perfect numbers there is little to complain about other than Cowleys lame attempts at jokes and other chit chat every few numbers.  The musicians are terrific and are joined on several numbers by The Mount Molehill Strings (2 violins, 1 viola and a cello).  The cameraman is obviously smitten by Alex Eichenberger, a cutie on the cello.  Most of the numbers come from The Face of Mount Molehill album.  Ill be listening/watching this again very soon.  Excellent sound from either DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 or LPCM Stereo.  Video is also quite acceptable with occasional dark cuts.  Originally filmed for TV it comes in 1080p resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.",1479686400,,958,4.786585365853658
