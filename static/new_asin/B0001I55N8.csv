2003324,5,B0001I55N8,"This dvd contains 4 episodes...Doc Ock armed and dangerous...The cat...The Black cat...and partners. Not only that it has a sneak peak of the next 90's dvd intitled...The venom saga. These episodes are veary good. If you liked the others you'll just love this dvd. It also comes with easter eggs,soapboxes,and a 67 classic episode featuring doc ock!!!
Buy this dvd true believers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1084579200,7,437,6.064516129032258

2003352,3,B0001I55N8,"I would have given 4 or 5 stars if this were an entire season but it's only 4 episodes. Buy them if you feel you can't wait for this series to be released in its entirety but otherwise I would recommend avoiding these dvd releases and buying The Spectacular Spider-Man Complete Series blu ray instead. I would also recommend avoiding Ultimate Spider-Man at all costs. The show, not the comic. The comic is amazing.",1401062400,,414,4.608108108108108
2003353,1,B0001I55N8,"this should be around $3-5 its barely over an hour, and never understand why they never made like an actual season 1 or something like that for this, woulda been worth it.",1398384000,,171,4.375

2003357,4,B0001I55N8,"This isn't as good as the last 2 I reviewed, but it's better than The Ultimate Villain Showdown.

4. Doctor Octopus: Armed & Dangerous: When Peter arrives for a date with Felicia Hardy, she is kidnapped by corrupt scientist Doctor Octopus, in order to force her mother to provide him with ransom money in which she promised to fund his experiments.  The worst episode of season 1 made it to DVD.  It's not bad it just needed a LOT of polishing.  B-

43.  The Cat:  Doctor Octopus attempts to blackmail Anastasia Hardy into paying him ransom money in order to fund his dangerous experiments, by threatening to reveal that Felicia's father was the crook known as ""The Cat"".  This is much better.  A

44.  The Black Cat:  The Kingpin blackmails John Hardesky into revealing a secret super-soldier formula by making threats against Felicia. After Hardesky reveals his secrets, Landon is able to recreate and improve the formula for the crime lord. Kingpin uses the serum to transform Felicia into a ""black cat"", and forces her to carry out his crimes until he can create more serum.  A good continuation.  A

46.  Partners:  Alistair Smythe, currently working as Silvermane's top scientist, kidnaps the Black Cat. He then bribes Spider-Man into capturing either the Scorpion or the Vulture, whom both have unique DNA samples which are essential for Silvermane if he is to restore adulthood, in exchange for her release.  A good episode, but why was this on here?  Doc Ock isn't in it!  Ah well, I'll take what I can get so I shouldn't complain.  A-

A good compilation, but they should have used the first 2 episodes of season 2, the Insidious Six 2-parter, which is probably my favorite episode with Doc Ock in it as a main villain.",1366329600,5,1729,4.712374581939799
2003358,5,B0001I55N8,This is the cartoon that introduced me to Spider-Man as a kid in the 90's. I have collected all the available DVDs from this series and while I wish they would make entire series collection these are for those who remember this version of Spider-Man. This collection features conflicts with one of Spider-Man's most dangerous foe: DOC OCK.,1360713600,,339,4.862068965517241
2003359,5,B0001I55N8,"Marvel fan, I watch everything I can find and collect all as well. Worth getting for an marvel fan to add to a collection.",1357516800,,122,4.125
2003360,5,B0001I55N8,"I won't go in to too much detail about this wonderful DVD, save to say I was enthralled! The ""Partners In Danger"" story arc was more than satisfying and added an element that solidified the animated series.

Felecia Hardy/Black Cat! Wow! When the King Pin kidnapped Felicia's father and then transferred the super soldier formula (Her Father The Cat Had Memorized In 1943) into her, thinking he could control her actions, he made a big mistake!! Not only did Felicia become strong, powerful and agile, but she could control the metamorphosis of her physical countenance! Wow! The Black Cat was born! And this Black Cat would use her nine lives to bite and scratch the King Pin and seduce the Spiderman; with her natural attraction to Spiderman, it was only a matter of time before the two of them became involved. The sexual tension between the two was evident from the moment Black Cat intentionally allows herself to be discovered by a web swinging Spidey as she is robbing a jewelry store! She promptly knocks him out and then plants a kiss on his cheek (Every Guy's Dream) that he won't discover until Robbie points it out to him hours later after he's changed back to Peter Parker.

This DVD, like the others: Spiderman: The Ultimate Villain Showdown; Spiderman: The Return of the Green Goblin; Dare Devil vs Spiderman have DVD extras that include Stan Lee giving us his insights into characters and events. Absolutely perfect! The DVD could not have been better produced. Buy it and you won't be disappointed!

2003361,3,B0001I55N8,"I'm sure these little cartoons are fine most of the time. However, my Grandson had only seen the Movies and he had a funny look on his face when this cartoon started and it didn't hold his interest very long. Product seems fine for what it is.",1320537600,,243,4.191489361702128
2003362,2,B0001I55N8,"I don't believe any of these DVDs are worth the money.  You get a measily 4-5 episodes for $13?  Like others have said this should not have been called Spiderman Vs Doc Ock...perhaps featuring Dock Ock or Spidey Featuring The Black Cat but not Vs.  There isn't enough Doc Ock  in this DVD to justify the title.  Another issue I have with this DVD is it is an incomplete story.  How are you going to take part of a series and put it on the DVD but not offer the rest of the story?  This exemplifies the fact that these DVDs should be Box Sets NOT compilations!  This really is one of the best Animated Series ever made with a wide variety of heroes, villains, suspense and action.  Unfortunately because the entire series hasn't been released people are being milked for every penny just to own if lucky about a 4th of the series.  As much as I like this series....I can't recommend it for value of money.  If you do buy any of these compilation DVDs I recommend the Venom one.  It is the most complete and at least Venom the main focus on his DVD.  Please release Box Sets of this series, Fantastic Four, and XMen have already been released.",1289865600,,1141,4.3254716981132075
2003363,4,B0001I55N8,My grandson loves Spiderman and he was so happy to get this dvd.  He has the Green Goblin and Venom already and we watch part of one before he takes his nap.  I was happy with the delivery time and the seller so no complaints about this at all.,1285286400,,244,3.9591836734693877
2003364,3,B0001I55N8,This DVD wasn't bad but the title should be changed to Spider-Man and the Black Cat.  Spider-Man was only versus Dr. Octopus for the first segment and he only made a cameo in further segments.  Good cartoons but don't expect a lot of Spider v. Octopus action.,1283040000,,259,4.48936170212766
2003375,1,B0001I55N8,I thought that this video would be calmer than some of the other Spiderman cartoons that I have purchased in the past. It is still pretty violent and I had to take it away from my 4 year old. I am surprised how hard it is to find a Spiderman cartoon for young kids.,1239148800,,265,3.925925925925926
2003376,5,B0001I55N8,"This is exactly why Amazon needs to make a deal with Buena Vista Home Entertainment. This is one of my favorite cartoons as a child, and this dvd only has a handfull of episodes. WE NEED FULL SEASON BOXSETS OF THIS SHOW AMAZON, PLEASE! Buena Vista Home Entertainment has the rights to this show, and they simply refuse to release it on Season boxsets.

2003380,3,B0001I55N8,"Having yet to see Spider-Man 2 I was able to watch this DVD without comparing the two.  However, from what I understand of Spider-Man 2 there is no Black Cat, which is odd because this DVD could have been entitled ""Spider-Man and Black Cat.""  Black Cat is a rich girl who pines for Spider-Man, and is turned into a superhero through some of the usual hocus pocus.  I would have been very interested to see how Sam Raimi would have handled this story line had he stuck to this one in his new movie.  I think the Black Cat character is an interesting one, I just feel as though these episodes really screw it up.  There are the obvious flaws: old school animation, abysmal voice acting, and a complete avoidance of any type of dramatics.  Then there are the larger problems, such as how the writers of these episodes seem to have been using too much cold medication while writing the scripts. I thought it was odd when they turned sweet Felecia into a muscle bound butt kicker named Black Cat, but I got used to it.  Then these provided the DVD with its most surreal moment when a tyrannical baby states that he has no interest in his bottle, but that his body does. Never mind...I can't explain it.  There is also a comparison between pizza and the Shield that is only funny in its unfunnyness.  The DVD does have its charms though.  I loved the shot it took at cowardly CEO's who declare all those who they don't like cowardly.  I also enjoyed the Captain America cameo.  But still by the time the DVD ended I was fighting a strong urge to doze off.  Maybe I'm just comic book ignorant, or maybe not. 5.00 out of 10",1102464000,,1615,4.361204013377926
2003381,3,B0001I55N8,"Ok, I will admit that the Spider-man Animated Series was one of the best modern kids' cartoon shows.  I was certainly a fan.  However, the way they are releasing the DVDs is really crappy.  Spider-Man's seasons averaged about 13 episodes. Normally, a thirteen-episode season on DVD would be about 20 bucks.  Instead we are getting four episodes for our twenty bucks.  Also, the best part of Spider-Man was the ongoing storylines.  Here the episodes are taken out of the full context.  In short, you can buy this if you really like the Spider-Man show. But otherwise keep your money, because you're kinda being ripped off.",1101859200,28,621,4.857142857142857
2003382,5,B0001I55N8,"Spiderman of the 90's is one of the most exceting shows by Marvel.

It is worth owning by far, the best Marvel has produced.

A total of 65 episodes were made, but I think they could have gone to 120 easy.

I am buying every DVD I can get of this show.",1098144000,2,252,3.8076923076923075
2003383,4,B0001I55N8,I do like this modern version of Spider-Man. It was produced in the 90's with a little computer animation for the buildings in the background.  I do have to say it is better than most cartoon adaptions of Marvel.  Much better than the kid friendly Fantastic Four produced at the same time.  If you like the comics you won't be disappointed.  While not spectacular like some multi million dollar epics it still is entertaining.  The 80's incarnation with Firestar and Iceman should still make it's way to DVD.  It's a worthy companion to this series.,1092787200,3,549,4.726315789473684

8012921,3,B0001I55N8,"Not one of the best as Spiderman goes. The commentary by Stan Lee is worth listening too. Without seeing more of this 1990's version of the show it's hard to put into context, because there's so few of this series on dvd. Not all segments of this show - not all episodes are worth viewing over and over again. I saw this show when I was child so I don't remember all the different characters and storylines.

8012923,5,B0001I55N8,The episodes are mostly focused around Black Cat instead of Doc Ock. There are only 4 episodes the first is about Doc Ock's origin the next 2 are about Black Cat's origin.
