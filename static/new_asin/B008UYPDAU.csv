8530659,4,B008UYPDAU,"A sweet, unassuming movie from a simpler time. It gave an interesting snapshot of city life in England in the 1950s. Very glad I gave it a try.",1423872000,,143,4.142857142857143

8530661,3,B008UYPDAU,"Early 20th Century black and white British film. The title sums it up, the angel is sent to right some of her previous goofs. Not a bad film, but slow moving and doesn't really take advantage of possible plot development. Predictable.",1383696000,,234,4.7317073170731705
8530662,5,B008UYPDAU,"Well, my wife wanted this one as part of her interest in Ms. Cilento's work -- I was prepared to deal with not being able to  understand post-war British film-making dialogue, but was surprised that I followed almost every word.

A simple feel-good plot, impossible not to enjoy.",1371686400,,279,4.791666666666667
8530663,5,B008UYPDAU,First saw the film when I was an impressionable young man of 18 and instantly fell in love with Diane Cilento who was not much older than me then. So bought it during a period of nostalgia and it didn't disappoint being very evocative of an age now gone and lost innocence. Well worth a look,1364169600,,291,4.214285714285714
