4683232,4,B005FMKVQ6,"I'm a big fan of these ""family night at the movies"" movies. I actually missed this one somehow and since I usually like the movies, and I have always loved Candace Bure and used to watch Jag, I asked my husband to buy me this for Mother's Day since I couldn't find any other way to see it. My kids are too young to appreciate these shows. I did enjoy it. It's good, wholesome, family entertainment. I don't have some deep comment to make but if you typically like the movies in this series, you should like this one.",1340409600,,516,4.222222222222222
4683233,4,B005FMKVQ6,"Splendid acting from the lead talents and the supporting cast, and a solid script that emphasizes core family values makes this made-for-TV film a winner. Dave James Elliot (JAG) and Candace Bure (Full House) are two singles who come together and deceive a prospective employer for the purposes of advancing their careers. They acknowledge lying is wrong and try to fix the problem, but are delayed in doing this due to a string of comical and unexpected circumstances. Plenty of laughs throughout and a solid moral message make this film a family friendly favorite.",1334361600,4,566,5.031914893617022
4683234,1,B005FMKVQ6,"The whole thing was rather silly.  David James Elliott is a very talented, versatile actor and deserves better scripts than this.  It certainly did not show-case his ability as an actor.",1331424000,,186,4.967741935483871
4683235,4,B005FMKVQ6,"Having witnessed her parents go through a messy divorce when she was in college, Annie is passionate about saving marriages and families. In spite of not being married herself, she is an excellent marriage and family therapist. While attending a charity event with a friend she catches the attention of a philanthropist who is used to having things his way. He decides she would be a good radio host for one of his programs. He notices a photographer at the event taking a photo of her with ""her husband and two kids."" Actually he is mistaken. The ""family"" is an old college acquaintance who has been a widower for three years, along with his two teenage kids. She just happens to be talking with them when a roving photographer stops to take their photo. She receives an invitation from ""Bish,"" the philanthropist to come to his ranch in New Mexico with her family to discuss the future. At the risk of losing this opportunity, Annie convinces Mark, the friend from her college days that she hasn't seen since her freshman year, to bring his kids and come with her, posing as her family. Mark is trying to raise money to keep his after school program going for local kids, so he recognizes the chance to pitch his program to ""Bish"" for funding. They all end up at the ranch--thousands of acres of New Mexico land with horses, ATVs, swimming pool, and its own Old West main street. The kids are having a great time while Annie and Mark are haunted by the lie they are living.  They just can't seem to find the opportunity to tell the truth, and they keep getting deeper into the lie.
There is not a single inappropriate moment between Annie and Mark. There is no offensive language or suggestive dialogue. You truly can sit and watch with your whole family. The only negative I see about this ""family film"" is that the storyline comes across more as a chick flick to me, and I enjoyed it because I am a chick. I'm just not so sure that the men in my family would be as interested, though there are some scenes of manly things like riding horses and mending fences. There is also a fun little scene with two songs by former American Idol finalist Danny Gokey, who plays Bish's ""neighbor"".
The movie stresses the value of honesty and does it without seeming ""preachy"". It was enjoyable, though predictable, with some reasonably good acting. It is only $13 at Wal-Mart, but if there isn't one nearby, you must live on the moon and you can order it here, though shipping may be astronomical!",1329782400,8,2487,4.551339285714286
4683236,4,B005FMKVQ6,This is a really nice family movies.  David James Elliot was georgous as per usual and the rest of the actors were great as well.  Nice story easy watch.,1327968000,2,153,4.241379310344827

4683239,4,B005FMKVQ6,"Jonathan Frakes, of Star Trek- The Next Generation, directs and has a cameo in this shown on Fox, Walmart Family Movie Night film that's really pretty good for this genre.

Candace Cameron Bure, from Full House fame- in real life married to a Russian hockey player, plays an unmarried family counselor who is offered a great job by rich rancher/tycoon(Ronny Cox).  The proviso: she must be married and bring her family to visit his family on their sprawling New Mexico ranch.

She decides on the deceitful route and 'hooks up', just for the weekend while visiting the ranch, with a widower(David James Elliot) and his two children. She plans to tell the millionaire the truth ASAP, but keeps getting interrupted before she can.

Know what you're in for here!  Besides the annoying premise, the story is predictable, mushy, and sugar sweet around the edges.  But it's clean: no language, violence, sex.  There's mild drama, a touch of romance, and lots of silliness.  It's really about having fun in a gorgeous setting.

Our kiddoes liked watching all the fun: riding horses, ATV's, swimming, exploring ancient Native American ruins, dancing and music.  Actually, I found the special features with Meet the Stars, Just for Laughs, Behind the Scenes, interesting and poignant.",1312588800,12,1274,5.052631578947368

4683253,5,B005FMKVQ6,"Mark Crane (DJE) is desperate to find funding for his after-school sports program.  At a charity event he meets Bishop's (Ronny Cox) son who says there is at best a slim chance for consideration by his father.  Annie Morgan (Burre) is there with a friend who is also seeking funding.  Annie meets and impressed the elder Bishop and he calls her to visit at his NM ranch to interview for a talk show on his radio station.  He emphasizes that she bring her family.  Mark loved Annie from first sight when she tutored him in college, but she transferred to another college and he lost touch.  He married and had 2 children.  His wife died at home, with only the young daughter at her side, 3 years ago.  Mark recognizes Annie at the charity event and the 4 of them pose for a picture.  The Bishops think they are a family, so when he insists Annie bring her family with her for the weekend, she and Mark decide to pose as a family.  It's a rewarding weekend in many ways, and Bishop offers her the job and Mark his funding...until they disclose their deceit.  In a typical family movie ending, everything works out.  It's a great story to watch again and again.",1443916800,2,1158,4.410377358490566

4683256,3,B005FMKVQ6,"This was a cute movie, but not cute enough to be worth a second viewing. All of the actors did a good job and the importance of correcting a lie in a family and in a business relationship was just one part of the story.  There was also the sweet history of the H&h having known each other in college and the ability of the h to counsel people including the H's daughter who had lost her mother.  The setting was rich with every toy the country had to offer--horses and scooters, etc.--and everything worked out so easily that it just wasn't very interesting IMO.",1437523200,,562,4.3428571428571425
4683257,2,B005FMKVQ6,"I fell in love with a little movie Candace was it called ""Finding Normal"", so set out to watch everything she was in. I didn't hate this, but didn't like it either. The fact that the parents involved their children in a lie, offset any attraction for the romance. I was intrigued with the premise, but am not interested in watching it again.",1436918400,3,341,4.428571428571429
