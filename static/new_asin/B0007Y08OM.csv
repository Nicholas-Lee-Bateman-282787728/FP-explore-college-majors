The only cartoon they care to air is Spongebob and they air way too much of that. Now i miss these shows...LOL for the price it's worth it.",1322784000,2,288,4.0701754385964914

I like some of the shows they have on now but most of them I just find stupid. I especially have my issues with spongebob. I con't figure out if he is 1. an adult or a kid, and 2. a boy or girl. At least with the shows in the 90's I was able to tell what the character was as far as gender and age goes. They really need to put 90's shows on DVD. Does anyone know who I could talk to about this happening?",1316908800,,518,3.6339285714285716
2249682,2,B0007Y08OM,"Why is it that these new shows are highlighted, but not the old school stuff?  Aren't there already dvd's for most of these shows? And shows like ""Fairly Odd Parents"" are great, but my DVR can pick up a dozen shows in a few days time...

  Some one before me wanted 90's Nick, I am all for that. But what about us REAL old schoolers? You can't Do That on Television, The Pinwheel cast,  Out of Control!, Todays Special!""

2249685,5,B0007Y08OM,"Most of you actually admit that you do not own this DVD. All these so called ""reviews"" are NOT reviews of this DVD.

If you are not going to actually REVIEW this DVD, then you have no right to give it ONE STAR.

I need to know if there are any extras on the DVD. Are there Behind the Scenes? Are there any interviews with the cast and/or crew? Are there mini-games? Are there any hidden easter eggs?",1194393600,5,709,4.323308270676692

2249687,1,B0007Y08OM,"everyone said pretty much everything - i was searching for an old Nick show (Ahh! Real Monsters) and i got this. the old Nick shows were - as said - original in their ideas and animation (though i kinda prefer anime) - but at least you won't mix 'em up like you do now. the fairly odd parents is ok - i do enjoy it sometimes - but they got that phantom show that kinda look exactly like it! WHY? not a lot of cartoon artists? hire the ones Disney fired (although the new cartoon artists are not as good as the old ones during the classical times of Snow White & Cinderella..hmmm ok so i'll take it upto the early 90s to Aladdin but that's about it!)
anyway - i think i made my point clear. bring on the old shows on DVD - it's what us - your humble faithful viewers love to have - not some bunch of cloned shows (with all due respect)",1185235200,3,834,4.0
2249708,3,B0007Y08OM,"Mine will be a familiar refrain; the old Nick shows, please.  That Saturday night line-up was the absolute best.  My kids and I shared many special evenings watching those shows, and now that they've grown up and moved on, I'd like to recapture some of that magic.  As someone else has already commented; my check is written, just produce the goods.",1179619200,2,349,4.688524590163935

2249712,1,B0007Y08OM,I do agree with everyone who gave this one star. I WANT THE OLD NICKELODEON SHOWS ON THIS DVD!!! I don't have this DVD but I want to review anyway. I watched this channel since I was little. I still watch it now. At least there's a channel called Nicktoons Network that I can watch. I wish they would make a network called Nickelodeon Oldies and Favorites. That would be awesome!,1169337600,6,379,4.352112676056338

2249714,1,B0007Y08OM,"I agree with everyone that wants old nick. I remember putting on the TV and watching Legends Of The Hidden Temple,Guts,Are You Afraid Of The Dark? and so on. Put them on dvd. People would SURELY buy it.",1166918400,2,202,4.342105263157895
2249715,3,B0007Y08OM,"These are pretty good but there are even older shows from nick that were pretty good. For example: Gulla, Gulla Island, Maya the Bee, the World of David the Gnome, and Eureka's Castle.  They ought to resurrect some of those shows (for the kid in all of us adults).  Put a few of those on DVD and you'd have my money!!!  The episodes that I managed to save on VHS are being watched by my nieces and nephews and they like them as much as the new junk on TV.",1159833600,2,455,4.033333333333333

2249756,1,B0007Y08OM,"All the kids of the 90's know and loved all the old Nickelodeon shows: Rocko's Modern Life, The Angry Beavers, Are you afraid of the dark?, AHH! Real Monsters, Clarissa explains it all, Pete & Pete and the list goes on...

My question is.. Why aren't these shows on DVD, as a rememberance of the old Nickelodeon??! Why are they always spewing out all the new, and all alike, I might add, shows on DVD now, even though they still play them 12 hours a day already???!

Nick never plays these old, unqiue, well-written, funny, ORIGINAL shows on regular day-time runs, except maybe 1 hour on Sunday, from what I saw.

I know many kids, and adults today would enjoy and would buy, these old shows/cartoons on DVD today. I sure the heck would!

I loved all the old shows, they were never boring. Always original with creative, witty humor woven in the 15 to 30 mintues of your life that you could just watch and laugh or just enjoy.

Yes, Nick has been putting out 1 or 2 DVDs recently like the 1st seasons of Clarissa explains it all and Pete & Pete, but I truly miss all the cartoons Nick had, so why don't they put those on DVD.. I really hope they do... SOON!

I truly miss all the old nick shows, they made nick original, clever and great, I don't see that anymore on Nick.

How many times can you watch Danny Phantom, Spongebob or Avatar?, the plots get boring, in my opinion.

If you agree with anything I wrote here, please rate my review highly, or write a review of your own explaining your view on the Old verses the New Nick.

OUT with the NEW, IN with the OLD! Long live 90's Nickelodeon!!",1149206400,196,1596,4.311036789297659
