The DVD's were not in the correct regional code for my DVD-player, European standard. Probably they have the format for US-standard?",1509840000,,190,4.96875
8424385,5,B004CZRDWM,"Most interesting season of all Octopus series. Tano Cariddi is absolutely the main character of all the Octopus series.  Remo Girone had done an excellent job playing this character. Outstanding actor.
Luka Zingaretti is good for playing his part as well. Very talented actor. Very believable in playing a good guys (Moltalbano) and bad ones too.
Love this season!",1472688000,,364,5.169491525423729

8424387,5,B004CZRDWM,"I am a huge fan of the Octopus series.  This specific review is for Octopus 8-10.  Octopus 8 & 9 break from the usual writing mode with new screenwriters and a look back into the past of major character Tano Carridi played brilliantly by Remo Girone.  Tano has been a significant character since his introduction at the end of series 3.  In Octopus 8 & 9, however, the character is a young boy growing up with a surrogate father since his mother was killed when Tano was a young child.  We see this several times through flashbacks to the time her death occurred and Tano realizes who was responsible.  At this young age, Tano is learning to cope with the way things are when the village is run by a Mafia don.  He sees the current don killed and his real father taking over the role.  Tano is clever and quick, but also manipulative.  He develops a friendship with a young boy whom he prevents from being killed, but is instrumental in having his own father killed through manipulating the man's wife.  He is taken in by the rescued boy's wealthy family and sent away for education.  Octopus 8 & 9 does not have the Ennio Morricone musical score that the previous series have been famous for.  Morricone's music is so much an integral part of the films that when it is missing, you certainly notice.  Luckily, the Morricone soundtrack returns in Octopus 10 as well as the adult Tano Carridi played again by an older Remo Girone and Judge Conti played by the French actress Patricia Millardet (whose hair, by the way, gets shorter and shorter with each new series).  These two major characters take up where we left off in Octopus 7 and they bring an eventual end to the whole series.  Tano Carridi is again brought back into the Mafia world because of his special computer and banking skills.  He cleans up nicely from his disheveled state in retirement, and we see again the ""I'm in charge"" man whom we fell for during the previous films.  Throughout Octopus 10 Tano uses his skills to advance the Mafia's agenda; however, because of his plan to kidnap a young girl to exert leverage over her father, he eventually has flashbacks to his true love, Esther, and he softens.  After a struggle with what he is doing at this stage of life, he decides to seek redemption.  At the conclusion, not only does Tano find his redemption, but Judge Conti concludes her long-running investigation into who assassinated her own true love, Inspector Corrado Cattani.  Although there are several major stand-out characters and actors throughout the entire series, my personal favorite is the character of Tano Carridi and the absolutely brilliant actor Remo Girone who plays him so well.  Kudos to all who made this complete series possible.",1355875200,3,2726,4.672955974842767

8424389,2,B004CZRDWM,"Zingaretti was out of his element. As Montalbano he is perfecto:
explosive, comedic and natural. La Piovra 8-10 was a major disappointment.
Everything went down hill: music, actors, plot,director,anamorphic screen
distortion and even graphics. The plots were really absurd and the
cinematography lame.
These episodes should have never been attached to the previous ones.
They were unnecessary and bad Hollywood emulations.",1346716800,3,422,5.934426229508197
