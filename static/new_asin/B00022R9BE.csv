2056756,4,B00022R9BE,"One of the hardest nuts to crack in the genre of sports films is how to make a good film about cycling. Breaking Away got about as close as you can get, but that was really more about growing up and coming of age, and cycling was but the vehicle for the story. Graeme Obree's story is not only a cycling story, but a story about one of the most peculiar aspects of the sport - the World Hour Record and track cycling in general. I think the film did as good a job as possible at telling the story, and making it as accessible as possible to a wide audience without making cycling insiders groan with disgust. I think some cycling outsiders will be a bit stumped and confused by it. Apparently, much of the details of Obree's life are tweaked for the movie, which is unfortunate.

I was seriously annoyed to see that the Union Cycliste International and the various officials (Verbruggen?) of the organization that made Obree's challenge so miserable were not able to be named by name. I hope they were in the book, but I suppose the filmmakers had legal reasons not to name them. They were not even allowed to use the actual rainbow champion jersey that Obree won fair and square - twice. It is even worse in hindsight when you realize that at the same time that the UCI were hassling Obree, the sport was rotting from the inside with doping. What are your priorities, UCI?

The actors, Boyd and especially Cox, are excellent. As is Laura Fraser, who play's Obree's wife and embodied the spirit of the wonderful supporting spouses that stand behind and believe in so many athletes chasing a dream.",1194480000,5,1597,4.484536082474227
2056757,3,B00022R9BE,"Not a bad movie, especially for hard-core cycling fans.  Still, it is a rather odds movie.  The protagonist Graeme Obree, is an odd duck.  This film gives little or no clue as to what fuelled his ferocious competitive drive to set cycling records.  It gives no clue as to what mental demons plunged him into depression and attempted suicide. (Was it because he was picked on or bullied as a kid?  Because he wasn't breast-fed?  Early potty-training?  What??)It gives little hint as to why the cycling powers that be conspired against him.  It gives little insight as to how or why he pulled himself out of his depressive cycle.

He has a hot wife and an adorable kid, but really doesn't seem to be there for them.  He comes off in the movie as a bit of a cycling robot, a cyborg.

Not quite a cycling Rocky, because Balboa had passion and his motives written on his sleeve.

Again, a middle-of-the road movie experience with somewhat cardboard two-dimensional characters.",1194134400,2,971,4.680473372781065
2056758,3,B00022R9BE,"Professional cycling is a very demanding sport, and the hour record is probably the hardest of cycling achievements. Without the help of the peloton and unaffected by the elements, the cyclist must race alone against both the clock and himself.

This movie tells the story of Graeme Obree, who rose to fame by breaking this record. But instead of highlighting his superhuman effort, made even harder by his clinical depression, this movie reduces it to an ""ordinary"" Cinderella story.

It's fun and heartwarming to watch -- the acting, the cinematography and the soundtrack are quite good.

Some parts of the story, like the struggle between Obree and the UCI are wonderfully played, but watching the movie, I kept feeling that something is missing for me: the realization of how amazing Obree's effort was, and what a superman he must be, overcoming his illness and transcending the abilities of the human body, to a record of 52.713km in a hour.",1193788800,11,947,4.943396226415095
2056759,1,B00022R9BE,"As an active cyclist and fan of bicycle racing I was excited at one more motion picture about a bicycle racer.  Viewing the film I was bothered by the trite elements.  Was Obree ever a bicycle messenger?  No.  Did he ever put training wheels on ""Old Faitful?""  No.  Did he fall off his bike when the officials red flagged him?  No, he actually tried to run down the official standing in his way -- now that would have been a good cinematic device that would have been truly humorous.

I hope Obree got a bundle of cash for the rights because the producers and directors made a mockery of his life and his personal struggle with a manic-depressive condition.  If you really want to know about Obree and his life read his book which has the same name.  It is a dark, yet inspriing, tale of the human struggle with demons inside his head.",1191801600,6,835,4.363636363636363

I am in awe of his physical accomplishments and understanding and sympathetic to his manic-depressive illness, as I have several family members who also suffer from this terrrible disease. I read the book The Flying Scotsman and loved it. I then eagerly looked forward to the movie for months. It was awful. One of the worst movies that I have ever seen and it is such a shame, as Graeme Obree is truly a remarkable man.",1191456000,3,487,4.48314606741573
2056761,5,B00022R9BE,"I bought the movie after reading the book and still enjoyed the movie.  Greame Obree owned Irvine Cycles ( you will read about it in the book) and I met him a few times in the shop that I worked in just a short distance away from the cycle shop and I can tell you that Jonny Lee Miller was spot on with his performance of Greame.  Coming from Ayrshire and growing up in that time it was like watching a home movie with the bullying, depression and struggles.  He is an amazing man and one day he will get the privelledge of knowing this.  All fans must read the book to get the full stories of the heartbrake and the full story of loss he endured.",1191283200,4,647,4.070866141732283
2056762,5,B00022R9BE,"I just got back from a trip to Scotland--my first visit--and saw this film on the plane (Virgin Atlantic). Fabulous movie! I'm not Scots or a bicycler, but just loved it--beautifully filmed, wonderful acting, a great movie experience. I can't wait to get the DVD and watch it again with my family. Unfortunately I saw it on a small screen on the plane, but it was still terrific. The original soundtrack was also excellent. It was especially nice watching this on a trip to Glasgow, where it was filmed. Highly recommended for the cinematography, great acting, sensitive portrayal of Obree's depression, and the personal relationships that help him to succeed. Suitable for kids over about 8 or 10 in my opinion, one little bit with bad language (the f* word, said once). Very original film.",1189814400,8,791,4.866666666666666
2056763,5,B00022R9BE,"I'm just home from enjoying one of the most exciting cinema experiences of my 51 years. As a recreational cyclist, and having trained hard and at least attempted racing, I knew that I would enjoy a film which focused on the life of a real athlete - rather than a fictional styling (Breaking Away) or one race (Hell On Wheels).

With 50% Scot blood in my veins I felt at home with the voices and scenery, but I found myself quickly intensely involved with the characters and swept away by the quality of the cinematography and the stunning surround sound. I've pre-ordered the DVD - but this is the very definition of big screen cinema entertainment.

In the late night screening I was lucky to have a whole row to myself - so no one witnessed my emotional gasps, or the times during the races when I was literally shaking with excitement.

I loved the way that Graeme's struggle with manic depression is given respectful depth - especially since his illness was an integral part of what drove him obsessively to achieve. Too few films deal effectively with the stress and reality of being bipolar. We need to see that he is loved, respected and supported as living with a mental illness, but also that he can accept polite active intervention.

This is a remarkable story - extremely well told. Full praise to all of the cast - especially Jonny Lee Miller, who looks and lives the part and to Brian Cox, one of Britain's greatest dramatic actors (see ""The Lost Language Of Cranes"").

I've read that the film is a more than adequate precis of Graeme's story, so I'm very much looking forward to reading his autobiography as well.",1188172800,25,1628,4.6

2056767,5,B00022R9BE,"I happened to come across this movie while channel surfing and was immediately drawn to the storyline about a man setting world records in cycling while fighting the side effects associated with ""extreme bipolar disorder"". I never heard of this individual nor have I read his book prior to seeing the movie, but I was completely drawn into this man's struggle with mental illness. In addition to battling his personal demons, he is harassed by neighborhood bullies and a cycling organization that sadly does all it can to defeat him before he even gets on his bike! After reading a number of the reviews the general consensus appears to be the movie fell short of the book. Not having read the book, I can only say I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I feel Obree is an amazing example of what the human spirit is capable of accomplishing in spite of overwhelming adversity. As a former competitive power lifter, I understand the personal sacrifice required to successfully compete in an individual sport such as this. I also understand all too-well what it's like to compete in a sport where everyone around you is using performance-enhancing drugs because they lack the intestinal fortitude to win through hard work. It seems everyone now days is taking drugs that have become so prolific on every level in every sport. This is a truly amazing story of one man's fight to overcome all the adversity that was dealt him and be victorious. What I felt was most shocking of all was the manner in which those making the rules for this sport behaved like children by making every effort possible to derail Obree  from accomplishing his dream. Their adolescent behavior is juxtaposed against Obree's human spirit to win and it really shows how far some people have to go to overcome not only their own life challenges, but the challenges posed by others around you. What I found most satisfying was to see that Obree is still alive today, and with the help of mental health treatment has not only been able to live a more fulfilling life, but surprisingly still competes in cycling-related events. I recommend this movie as a great motivational tool for all!",1419206400,,2152,4.78494623655914

Boring; poorly made; You can't understand half the dialogue for the thick Scottish accents (and I'm usually great at understanding even foreigners with broken-English and thick brogues!); It was formulaic; There's no reason to identify with or have any empathy for the characters; and it seemed like half the movie consisted of the riding of a bicycle around in circles. Total waste of time- not one redeeming quality! It's as if someone assembled a series of images and cheap video clips for a Youtube video!

2056779,5,B00022R9BE,"In 1993 a Scotsman by the name of Graeme Obree rode a bicycle 32.1 miles in a single hour, setting a world record. He had no sponsorship, no coaching, no training. The bike he rode was one he built, using parts cannibalized from his washing machine. He went on to win the world pursuit championship twice and reclaim the one hour record in 1995. And yet, he is little known. This movie documents those events and hopefully will introduce his feats to a much broader audience.

This 2006 movie is based on the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flying-Scotsman/dp/1841583359/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flying Scotsman</a>&nbsp;that Obree wrote in 2005. Capably directed by Douglas Mackinnon (predominantly a TV series director) Jonny Lee Miller plays Obree convincingly. Miller played Oren Goodchild in Aeon Flux but no one watched that. The dirty secret is that Obree has bipolar disorder and is prone to bouts of depression. The movie depicts childhood trauma that may have contributed to his disease.

The movie is captivating, suspenseful, and inspirational. One roots for Obree all the way, feeling compassion at his self-sabotaging behaviors. The bike scenes are well done, although, as a cyclist I don't think the grit needed and pain endured to ride flat out for an hour are fully conveyed. I'm not sure they ever could be.",1356825600,,1375,5.420560747663552

With all the dramas unfolding around Lance Armstrong it is something to remind us that acts of individual integrity are often not seen on the public stage but go on unseen on the frozen roads of training or dark recesses of our mind unravelling. It is a gritty and inspiring telling of the psyche of professional sport and mental health. It had elements of ""The World's Fastest Indian"" in that it shows there is room in the world for those who will do it their way, against the mainstream and odds because they have a belief and are driven to do so.

This is a great, ""based on a true story"" type of film. A story of triumph and ingenuity. It features some good actors and decent cinematography (it's rated at 7.0/10.0 at IMDB). The Flying Scotsman is a movie for everyone, not just cyclists--but if you are a cyclist, I think you would thoroughly enjoy this movie even more.

It's pretty crazy how this guy built a bike out of washing machine parts and scrap metal that he used to break the world hour record in 1993. He challenged the accepted view of what bikes should be and how cyclists should ride during competition--some of the best parts of the movie are his comical clashes with the International Cycling Union who repeatedly disqualify him for his unconventional bikes and style of riding.

Utilizing a revolutionary position for his arms and using washing-machine parts on his bike - ""Old Faithful"" - Obree set the world distance record for one hour in 1993 and 1994, along with capturing a world championship in individual pursuit. The film focuses on the singular vision of Obree in developing new riding techniques and its consequences when he becomes a sensation on the international stage, along with delving into the psychological scars from being bullied as a youth.

The idea of bike as an escape mechanism - he flees the bullies on a bike and is in solitude when on the track as an adult - is fascinating, but ultimately cannot speed past the movie cliches of an underdog against the establishment and falls flat with some unsettling attempts at comic relief.

The velodrome scenes carry a special intensity, but the story may ultimately stall for those who do not know the back story of Obree and the real-life politics in world class cycling.",1229299200,,1236,4.9326923076923075

*SPOILERS*

""The Flying Scotsman"" tells the story of Graeme Obree, a championship cyclist from Glascow, who, in the mid 1990s, twice broke the world speed record using a bike he'd constructed out of washing-machine parts.  To achieve his success, Obree had to wage battle against not merely the leaders of the World Cycling Federation - who considered him an upstart and thus did everything they could to try to keep him from competing - but his own personal demons brought on by childhood trauma and clinical depression.

This slight but engaging film boasts an intriguing locale, smooth direction by Douglas Mackinnon and endearing performances by Johnny Lee Miller, Billy Boyd, Laura Fraser and Brian Cox.  These serve as effective counterweights to all the sports-underdog, hometown-hero-makes-good cliches inherent in the story.

For the movie makes it clear that Obree did indeed become something of a folk hero for the citizens of Scotland, who are often forced to play second-fiddle to their more haughty neighbors to the south.  For a brief but shining moment, however, the nation of Scotland stood atop the world of competitive cycling, all thanks to its Favorite Son, Graeme Obree.",1214006400,,1200,5.186528497409326

Who was this man we'd never heard of?

But the cycling exploits, which are as much about the loneliness of training and the head-butting frustration of dealing with sports officials, takes Obree to the point of suicide, and a long wrestle with manic depression. On this note, the film is unbelievably authentic, and there's a scene - actually when Obree is being feted by fans - when you can tell his brain has, what I'd say, ""just slipped off the face of his own life.""

What drove Obree? It was a painful lack of self-confidence instilled by years of bullying and by precious little help from his own father, a policeman.

As with many trues stories of depression, what anchors Obree is the support of his incredible wife, and the support of his small circle of loyal friends: here compacted into one joyous character who is like a beacon in the dour, overcast Scottish social landscape inhabited by Obree. This movie absolutely nails the realities of depression, and is one of the most honest small movies I've seen in a long time. Yeah, I wept.

If you're looking for an exciting cycle race movie, no, this is not the one for you, but if you want a movie that takes you into the sometimes dark world of the human soul, be prepared for one tough ride. The glory of this story is that Obree climbed out of the worst of his depression (he still battles with it) but in doing so in this movie he shows us that human achievement can often be quite detached from one's sense of personal success. As this inspirational story shows: a world record didn't satisfy Obree's demons.

Incidentally, for those who wonder: the film was made with Obree's own input, and he actually supplies the close-ups in the beautifully shot time-trial sequences.",1200182400,37,2085,4.732782369146006

Worth watching especially if you are a cyclist, the Flying Scotsman covers the life of Grame Obree and his battles with depression and oppression.  While it deviates somewhat from the book of the same title, the DVD does catch the important aspects of his life and racing.",1198800000,,427,7.056603773584905
2056802,4,B00022R9BE,"I had to watch the film because Billy Boyd (Lord of the Rings) was in it, and Johnny Lee Miller (Hackers).  I was definitely not disappointed.  This was a great film based on a true story about a Scotsman with drive to become World Cycling Federation champion.  What I didn't know was he battled Manic Depression, which you almost don't quite see in the film until it beings to manifest itself more and more.  Additionally, Obree battles the ever-changing rules of the WCF.  It just seems form time he was a kid to even cycling he was always made to feel worthless, and he fought all the way.  You can't help but root for the guy.

Brian Cox, Johnny Lee Miller, and most especially Billy Boyd, playing Graeme Obree's manager, did a superb job.  This was a great film about beating the odds without the syrupy music.  It was just great story telling all around.

Definitely recommended.",1196553600,3,885,4.579617834394904

With it's great cinematography, excellent acting and charming production values, I thoroughly enjoyed this subtle escape from the sad mainstay of the Hollywood-fiction-action-blockbuster. I'm not an avid cyclist so although I  appreciate other comments about how this may have downplayed the full struggle Graeme Obree must have endured to achieve world-fame, I understand why the filmmakers had to strike this balance in order to make this delightful story accessible to a wider family audience. Thoroughly enjoyable and delightful spirit-lifting stuff !",1195430400,,669,5.6138613861386135
