1691600,5,B000063K2C,"If you are expecting a mecha series based on the cover illustrations, you are going to be badly disappointed.  If you are hankering for a serious and compelling anime series that will challenge you, ""Now and Then, Here and There"" (NTHT) is a very fine example.  This series is a match with ""Grave of the Fireflies"" in its depressing story.
Briefly, this series covers the exploits of a 15 year old boy, Matsutani Shuzo or Shu, as he is pulled into the distant future when he attempts to rescue a girl, Lala-Ru, from a mechanized extraction force.  In this distant future, Shu experiences some really tough ordeals as he continues his attempts to rescue the girl and return home.  What Shu experiences is no match for what an American girl, Sara, who has been abducted from the same present that Shu exists and whom he meets, goes through in this series.
Through the course of NTHT, issues like child soldiers, torture, rape and its effects, the micro aspects of war, and even conservation are dealt with.  No matter how tasteful some of these issues have been tackled in the series, the impact is no less brutal.  You WILL flinch at some of the brutal stuff depicted in the series.  Some scenes are absolutely gut wrenching.
NTHT has 13 episodes and none of them are fillers.  Each episode follows on from the previous episode with no recaps.  The pacing is very good with no significant let up in the story flow.  From the first five episodes in the first disc, NTHT builds up the brutal and depressing world in a very unrelenting manner.  The second and third discs then advances the series like an unstoppable train towards its cathartic ending.  Watching all 13 episodes in a marathon session is not recommended unless you want to be emotionally drained at the end.
This is not an easy series to watch but you will be greatly rewarded when you finish it.  For serious anime buffs, this series comes very highly recommended.
The box set is attractively priced and includes an additional disc filled with extras.",1023148800,16,2014,4.6875

I first saw this show on AXN in my country and no matter how unpleasant things got for the characters, I just had to watch it until the finale. After the last episode aired, I just knew I had to get the DVDs.
The 3 DVDs are also available seperately, they each have high reviews here at Amazon. Don't take his word for it, or mine. Take the effort to check those reviews, THEN decide if you want to buy this.",1023062400,3,583,4.0344827586206895

But in this product, the extra bonus DVD with the bonus features is kinda useless. The ""making of"" is of the dubbing process, which I didn't really care about. The series were great and the dvd's weren't scratched AT ALL, which is what I cared about the most, but the 4th disc is useless. I wanted to see the actual making of the anime, not the dubbing.

1691605,5,B000063K2C,"You're thinking not another end of the world anime...wrong. Now and Then, Here and There is probably the best end of the world anime I've seen. Even better than other great end of the world anime i.e. RahXephon, and Saikano. Heck it's one of the best anime I've seen.

Before I go on let me say this, this anime in my opinion isn't for anyone under 16 years old. There is a great deal of violence, rape, torture, and language. If you are older than 16 than this anime is a must.

The story is like nothing you've seen and will keep you engrossed all the way through. The story follows Shuzo Matsutani who on the way home from Kendo practice sees a girl on top of a factory smokestack. He tries to talk to her, then time stops everywhere and giant robots appear to capture the girl Lala Ru. They have come from 10 billion years in the future to take her back to their time. Shu tries to help but gets taken to the future with them.

The future Shu comes to is a bleak place. There is a on going war brought on by the country Hellywood bent on controlling the world. The earth is mainly desert and everyone fights for water. Shu grows up quickly and is determained to help Lala Ru and defeat Hellywood.

The story telling is amazing. I haven't watch anime with a story like this since. The story is intense, compelling, and has many parallels with today. The characters bring life to the tragic story that manages to bring hope at the end. The animation is nothing like other anime that seems glossed over it rough and light yet dark the adds to the story. The music is simply great.

Overall this is one of the best anime series ever. I highly doubt you've seen anything like this and highly recommend everyone who is over 16 watch this anime",1240704000,,1741,4.3119266055045875
1691606,5,B000063K2C,"I've read so much about ""NOW AND THEN, HERE AND THERE"" for so many years.

Pretty much about the brutality featured in war and children having to fight in war. War can be depicted in so many ways on screen but director Daichi Akitaroh (Director of Jubei-Chan the Ninja Girl and Elf Princess Rane) wanted to show how dark, dangerous and sick war can be.

You also have the talents of screenwriter Kurata Hideyuki onboard and is works with ""R.O.D."", ""Kamichu!"", ""Excel Saga"" and many other series is well noted.

But for the series main protagonist, not a knight in shining armor but a naive young teenager who believes in himself and others and his passion for survival and not at all submitting himself to the woes of a war is what I found quite interesting

This 13-episode anime series aired on WOWOW in Japan back in 1999-2000, was released on DVD in the US by Central Park Media/US Manga Corps back in 2002 and is currently airing on the Sci-Fi Channel in 2008.

I figured I wanted to watch for myself of how this anime series truly is and figure out if it would impact me the same way anime such as ""The Grave of the Fireflies"" or ""Barefoot Gen"". And although those anime can be seen as ultimately depressing ie. casualty of war, I know ""NOW AND THEN, HERE AND THERE"" for some reviewers felt it was too much for them because of the brutality and torture of key characters. So, I had to watch it myself and see if I felt the same.

The storyline of ""NOW AND THEN, HERE AND THERE"" is about a teenager named Shu. Shu is naive, almost a brat in someways and it shows in his technique during Kendo training. No focus, just all out attack and not worrying about defense.

One day as he walks home from his training, he goes up a water tower and sees a girl sitting down. As he tries to communicate with her, some monsters and space craft teleport to capture her. Shu goes to rescue the girl.

After some intense fighting, everyone is teleported back to another time. Where war and strife is common and water is a resource that is not available and rationed.

Whoever owns water will be powerful and thus a dictator named Hamdo wants it.

Hamdo who has conquered towns and killed many, destroyed their villages and whoever survives has become part of their army, typically the children who are then forced to be soldiers and inflict the same kind of destruction and pain on other villages by a the dictator's false promise that upon wars end, they get to go back to their village.

The Hamdo and the army of Hellywood knows they need the water and to do that, they need the girl named Lala-Ru.

Lala-Ru is the keeper of a bracelet and with her power and the bracelet, she has the power to create water or oceans but each time it is used, she uses up her life force.

Both Shu and Lala-Ru are held captive but Lala-Ru's bracelet is held by Shu and eventually loses it. But Hamdo, being the evil maniac he is, tortures Shu to find out where the bracelet is.

In Hellywood, you are introduced to other kids who are in the army such as Nabuco. Nabuco is the top of young soldier list and is seen as a leader and wants so much to return back home to his village but knows he must kill to do so.

Because he is saved by Shu, he tries to help Shu at a distance and eventually trying to convert Shu to a soldier.

You meet Sara, another person from Earth transported to this new world and has been serving time in jail because she looks like Lala-Ru. Shu promises her that he will find a way for them to go back home but for Sara, although not tortured, she is served by Hellywood to one of their soldiers to be raped.

The scenes of rape and torture are not shown on the DVD's. It's pretty much implied by the screams that you hear and how Shu and Sara are after their ordeal. Shu beaten up and bloodied, Sara who's demeanor has changed considerably after the rape.

It's a dark anime series but you end up rooting for these people who have suffered from tyranny and just hope they can overcome their challenges, survive and go back home.

VIDEO:

For a 1999-2000 TV series, the animation was simple, clean but the overall background theme of a desolate desert-like appearance of the land due to the lack of water and drought was well featured. The use of oranges and reds and browns, earth colors are used to showcase the overall feel of the series outdoors.

But all in all, I felt the animation to be well done, colorful and for a series nearly a decade old, everything looks very good.

AUDIO:

The series is presented in English, Dolby Digital 5.1 and in Japanese via dolby digital stereo. I watched the series mainly in Japanese and Shu's voice really makes him feel like a young teenage kid, while in the English dub, it gives an impression that he is slightly older.

But both audio presentations are done quite well!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The box set features a lot of special features and each volume (disc 1-3) showcases an art gallery, character sketches, mechanical sketches, background sketches, textless closing, storyboards, sneak peeks and DVD-Rom.

The fourth disc features more exclusive special features with a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the series and interview with the Central Park Media staff behind-the-scenes. Also, never-before-seen production sketches and storyboards, the Japanese opening and much more!

This is what you pretty much expect from a box set and again, Central Park Media/US Manga Corps delivered in this respect. They really give you your money's worth with their collections and if you were going to buy this series, the box set is the best place to go and you can find it online quite cheap these days.

I really enjoyed the series and each episode was quite riveting and really didn't want to stop watching once I started. The episodes really draw you in and there is a lot of intrigue and overall a well-written storyline and both the Japanese and English voice acting are well done.

The overall mood of war, how one has been affected by war was seen through the atmosphere created by staff and also the well-done acting to make you feel the pain of war. The storyline was well-written and each episode is definitely going to keep you glued and not wanting to stop. But also, I expect that the darkness of war and the things that happen during war time is not something everyone can see.

Yes, there is torture and their is rape. The major torture or rape scenes are not shown on this DVD but you know it happened after you see the mannerisms and the faces of Shu and Sara.

No one wants to see villages full of families and babies getting decimated by war but in war and watching the tyranny of Hellywood and its young soldiers doing the same things that were inflicted upon them by the same group they serve for is a key to show the state of how the soldiers are in.

A series built upon the survival and struggle of war is never meant to make the viewer feel easy but if anything, this series does give you hope. Hope for the main characters to get back to their homeland and hope that the war and the tyranny will end.

If I did have any problems with the anime series was the main character of Shu. If a cat has nine lives, Shu must be a cat because he was able to survive a lot of ordeals. But the main problem that I have is that Shu, literally a young teenager was able to accomplish a lot, as if he had some sort of superhuman status at times. So, I did he feel Shu's character may be given a bit too much heroic/athletic abilities for his age and what he was able to accomplish

Granted, a person with determination and persistence can accomplish a lot but for Shu to accomplish what he did in this anime series, director and original creator Daichi Akitaroh really made this young character to a hero and able to accomplish things despite injuries, torture and yet keeping his head high and not being broken down. Definitely a rough contrast to reality, especially from those who have suffered war.

But all in all, this series was very enjoyable. Very solid storytelling and makes me wonder if there is room for a second series.

Nevertheless, I finally watched this series for myself and yes, the anime does show the dark side of war and not everyone is going to watch it because of the brutality of the soldiers and war is never beautiful. Especially with the psycho tyrannic dictator of Hamdo that is just creepy and makes you wonder why no one in his army has assassinated him.

But you do see the light through the actions of Shu and how he is able to change people through his will and determination.

An awesome box set DVD release from Central Park Media and a series worth owning!",1219017600,2,8654,4.449715370018976
1691607,3,B000063K2C,"I bought this for a friend, who was more into this show than I.

The show borrows multiple good ideas from other sources (dystopian post-apocalyptic sci-fi, child soldiers, Hollywood, bowl cuts), but in the end it fails to achieve what it's aiming for.  That is -- a gritty sci-fi drama.  The animation makes any of the darker themes look more unreal and harder to believe.  There's rape, murder, torture and insanity, but they are mostly implied, rather than shown, which doesn't help the realism any,
while the lacking character development cripples the good, yet somewhat trite, plot.

Also the whole thing is too short, which probably contributes to the problems outlined above.",1202515200,3,682,5.053571428571429
1691608,1,B000063K2C,"I baught Now and Then, Here and There because 70 out of 75 people on amazon gave it a glowing review. Most claiming it was one of the best anime ever made. Then I watched it. What I found was easily THE WORST anime I had EVER seen.

I mean the animation is extremely dated even for an eighties anime. The voice acting was as flat abd stiff as a board. The plot was copy and pasted from dozens of other shows. The characters were shallow and 2d. However the most unforgivable error was the so called grand philosophy of the series. IT WAS COMPLETE GARBAG!!! One episode the brought up abortion and all they had to say about it and I quote, 'Life's to precious' and that's it. Sadly that's the way it is with most of the deep philosophy in the series. This more then anything serves to tick me off. Mean my god if all you're going to say about a deeply philosophical or debated subject is one stinken line why bring it up at all! Added to that the ending was extremely horrible even for an anime!! Yes I get the whole self sacrifice to save humanity because of a change in opinion of the species but come on. Add to the horrible ending and poor philosophy was the lack of realistic cause and effect. Which further irritates the heck out of me. The main character is brutally tortured at the beginning of the series and comes out of it with absolutely no change in his personality. When people are tortured for no good reason or just plain tortured for days on end it tends to make them spiteful, pessimistic, anger or something but they don't come out of it thinking humanity's great. Same with pretty much everything in the series.

Geesh it was the biggest pile of garbage I've ever seen. God I'd like to go and ask what show all these people that thought it was an amazing series saw in it.",1184112000,11,1791,4.295857988165681
1691609,4,B000063K2C,"If you found GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES depressing, just wait till you see NOW AND THEN, HERE AND THERE.  A shocking entry for Akitarou Daichi, the man responsible for the delightfully funny ANIMATION RUNNER KUROMI, this thirteen-episode mini-series is often disturbing with nary a lighthearted moment; at the same time, though, it is very intriguing and interesting to watch.

The series begins on a deceptively cheerful note when young Shuzo Matsutani--who refers to himself as Shu, so that's what I'll call him from now on--is making his way home from a kendo practice match when he sees -- wouldn't you know -- a mysterious, quiet girl sitting alone on a water tower. The girl, who goes by the name of Lala-Ru, catches Shu's eye and he somehow manages to strike up a conversation with her. Suddenly, out of nowhere these giant snake-like machines appear and kidnap the girl. In trying to rescue her, Shu finds himself transported away from his cheery hometown of Japan into a dreary, desolate futuristic world adorned with the very fitting name of Hellywood.  And this new place is sheer hell indeed; Shu finds himself prisoner on a dominating fortress where children from other parts of the world are being whipped into war soldiers.  It turns out that Lala-Ru has a pendant that can bring water and life back to this desolate world, and the insane, maniacal despot who commands the fortress, Hamdo, wants it at any cost. Of course, Lala Ru does not have it; Shu took it from her in a vain rescue attempt only to lose it again when he is taken prisoner himself. Subjected to physical torture and abuse, Shu is forced to become a soldier and observe one horrifying atrocity of war after another.

As with GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES, NOW AND THEN HERE AND THERE deals with the consequences of war as well as the plights of lonely individuals struggling to survive.  Here, however, the trauma is turned up by a huge notch. The children forced into war are a rather surly, sometimes confrontational bunch forced to commit terrible crimes against their will, making this a potentially sadder and bleaker story.  There are even plenty of scenes which involve backlashing, murder, genocide, and others that leave little to the imagination.  But all these seem like nothing compared to one particularly mean-spirited subplot, in which a young American girl, Sara, is raped by one of Hamdo's soldiers.  (We later discover that she is pregnant from this encounter.)  There are also several moments where Hamdo makes somewhat sexual advances toward Lala-Ru, much to the chagrin of his lady lieutenant Abelia.  Such sequences make NOW AND THEN, HERE AND THERE a very difficult and sometimes painful series to sit through, although the show does end on a positive note (albeit somewhat awkwardly).  Needless to say, this is not a series for either children or the faint at heart.

It also deals with some very compelling character studies, particularly in the cases of the children held prisoner at Hellywood.  One of them, Tabool, is nasty and cruel, secretly scheming to overthrow the dictator Hamdo and conquer the fortress.  His childhood friend, the emotionally wartorn and borderline dangerous Nabuca, hides a noble heart but often gives in to his darker side.  (Of the characters, he is the most interesting.)

Technically, NOW AND THEN, HERE AND THERE is not the most impressive show; the color palette is appropriately dark and imaginative, but the animation itself is more like traditional television quality, not up to the polish of shows like, say, FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST.  Simultaneously, however, this style gives the series even more of an edge.  The melancholy musical score is very fitting, although not necessarily one that will be remembered long after the show's over.

I should also give Central Park Media a shout-out for their treatment of this show.  In addition to having great picture and sound quality, there are lots of noteworthy extras.  One particularly enjoyable bonus is a feature where we see several of the voice actors of the English dub act out their lines and speak of their characters.  Even if you've already seen this type of feature before, it's nonetheless a point of interest, especially if you watch Anime dubbed.

As for the dub itself, CPM's track record of dubbing has been shaky, although their dubs for LODOSS OVA, SLAYERS, KUROMI, and WORLD OF NARUE are among some of their better ones.  So, too, is this one.  Although the ADR script stays a little TOO slavishly close to the subtitles, the dialogue flows well.  The vocal cast includes veteran dub performers such as Dan Green, Crispin Freeman, Rachael Lillis, Scottie Ray, and Lisa Ortiz.  All do excellent jobs, but it's really Jack Taylor that steals the show as the psychotically evil Hamdo.  His bravura role makes up for the some of the other weaknesses of the dub--one of which is that the children sound too mature.  Ed Paul's Shu, although emotionally sound, takes some getting used to as well.  All in all, though, it works pretty well for this kind of show.

With its dark, dreary nature and often painful sequences, NOW AND THEN, HERE AND THERE is not an easy series to recommend; however if it's emotionally powerful Anime you're looking for, then this series may be worth a look.",1181692800,,5277,4.901012373453319
1691610,5,B000063K2C,"Wow, this series is simply amazing. Everything about it great, from the story line, to the characters, to the amazing ending. After watching the crap fest that was ""Akira"" I almost gave up on non Miyazaki anime for good. After all,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira-Special-Edition/dp/B00005MAM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;was supposed to be the standard to all good anime out there, a master piece, but is sucked eggs. But I decided that anime deserved one more chance to prove its stuff. I stumbled on this series by accident, coming across it on a list mania page and thinking ""hey, this sounds good."" so I bought the series and gave is a chance, thank God I did.

The series starts out simple enough, our main character Shu is on his way home after losing a kendo match with his arch rival when he sees a young girl sitting on top of an old factory smoke stack. Being the kind of person he is, Shu climbs up to meet her and discovers her name is Lala Ru. But then they get attacked by futuristic machines and get sucked into an alternate world (or earth ten billion years from now, I can't really tell) onto the enormous battleship Hellywood. In this world the sun is a red giant, and because of its size almost all the water in the world has been evaporated, making earth a dessert planet. What makes Lala Ru so important in the fact that she can manipulate water though a small pendent she whereas around her neck.

What makes this series different from other films is the fact that there is so much cruelty directed towards children. There are many horrors here, like child rape, murder, torture, mass kidnapping, genocide, you name it its here. From the first time we see Shu get tortured, to the attempted rape scene at the beginning of episode 6, the series never lets up on the cruelty.

So let's break this series down into its parts and see just what makes it so great.

PLOT: the plot is pretty simple. Boy meets girl, girl has magical pendent, girl gets attacked by people wanting the pendent, boy tries to save girl, and boy and girl go on adventure. Sound familiar? It should, this is just what happened in Miyazakies&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Castle-in-the-Sky/dp/B00005JKYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Castle in the Sky</a>&nbsp;But after the first episode this series stops resembling ""Castle..."" and starts resembling&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grave-of-the-Fireflies/dp/B00070Q84U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grave of the Fireflies</a>.There is no high flying adventure here, just utter sadness and death.

CHARACTORS: this is the strength of the series. First we have Shu, a typical fun loving boy from Japan. Although he is farley stupid and weak, the fact that he refuses to give up on his morals despite all that is going on around him makes him the only ray of hope in this otherwise dark film.
Then we have Lala Ru. From the very beginning she is a mystery, and remains so up until the very end. She doesn't say much, in fact in most episodes she doesn't say anything at all, but the blank look on her face is very disturbing and haunting.
There are also Nabuca, Boo, and Tabool, three children solders kidnapped from their homes and forced into the army. These three characters are extremely different, with Boo being the young impressionable boy who still has some sense of morels, Nabuca being a person who will do anything to survive and go home, and Tabool who has let power get to his head and now dreams of conquering the world.
Then we have the two Hellywood natives, Abilia and Hamdo.  Hamdo is the king of Hellywood, and a certifiable nut case. He is completely insane, and his antics can be very funny at times, silly and childish at others, but downright scary most of the time. He is evil and the things he does are horrible, but sometimes you can't help but feel a tiny bit sorry for him because it doesn't really seem like he knows what he's doing. And then there's Abilia, his cold, devoted captain. She is pretty much Hamdo's right hand woman, doing whatever he tells her to and accepting the abuse he throws at her in stride. Why? Some would have you think it's because she's really in love with him, but I don't' know. Abilia never shows much emotion other than anger and frustration.
But the most powerful character in this series I think is Sara, an American girl, no older than 15, who was kidnapped from her home because she was mistaken for Lala Ru. She, by far, suffers the most in this series. Having no use to Hellywood, Sara is forced to be a comfort woman for the soldiers on board, in order to make her pregnant so she can have bare more soldiers for Hamdo's army. Subjected to constant rape, Sara evolves over the course of the series from a nave frightened little girl to a bitter, angry depressed young woman who has been forced to grow up faster than she wanted in this harsh world. It is amazing to look at how she completely changes form volume one to volume three.  I won't ruin the ending for you, but she makes a decision then that is so different form what she would have done in the first volume and is so sad it left me shaking long after the credits rolled.

MUSIC- I do have a high standard for movie music, being spoiled rotten by the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Return-of-the-King/dp/B0000DZEA1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Episode-V-The-Empire-Strikes-Back/dp/B0002YCVJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back</a>, and Miyazakies. This series doesn't match the quality of any of those films, but has a beauty of its own. The opening credits are fun and mask the dark theme of the series, while the ending lullaby is very pretty, but would have been A LOT better if it hadn't have been a vocal. The background music is good, but suffers from a lack of variety. The same sad theme is played almost every time something sad happens, which means it's played about every five to ten minutes. The rest is a mixture of fast paced drum beats and beautiful violin/flute scores. The drum beats can be a little cheesy, but the violin and flute solos are great, especially the theme for Zadi Bars (at the beginning of episode nine).  This series could have benefited from a better soundtrack, but it's good the way it is.

As for flaws this series does have a lot of them, as my non anime loving sister was all to ready to point out, but to most people you will be too sucked into this film to notice until you watch it the second or third time. The only things I would have done differently though are that 1) I would have focused more on Nabuca's and Sara's characters.  Both are underplayed and don't get enough screen time. Sara all but disappears in volume two (which caused me a lot of stress because I was dieing to know what happened to her) and Nabuca does the same at the beginning of volume three.  2) I would have Shu compromise on his morals just once, have him kill someone and feel guilty about it for the rest of the series.

ENDING - I can not believe how so many people can complain about the ending to this series. I have seen hundreds, maybe thousands, of movies and never has one left me completely satisfied and yet wanting more. It was so beautiful that and perfect that I was left speechless. I had been warned about the ending, but now can't understand why people didn't like it. I LOVED it, and consider it to be one of the best endings to any movie I've ever seen in my life. The ending is what put this series into my top five lists; it's currently my fourth favorite movie/series of all time.

This is it, the best anime ever made. True, Miyazaki is the greatest anime director ever, but his movies are good in TOTALLY different ways. If you're looking for a series that can quite possibly make you cry and WILL depress you, give Now and Then, Here and There a try, but remember to bring lots of tissues. You'll need them.

But what really got to me while watching Now and Then, Here and There was the realization that everything that happens in this series (apart from the sci fi elements) is right now happening in real life in places like Sudan and Kenya. Characters like Sara, Boo, and Nabuca are all representations of what is going on in Africa to this very day. If this series really depressed you the way it did me, than turn that into a constructive feeling. There is an organization called Compassion International that sponsors children in poor countries around the world. For $33 a month you can provide a child with food, medicine, and shelter. Please, it doesn't cost that much to do. If I can do it working as a bag boy, than I'm sure many of you can to.",1179187200,5,8972,4.8510777269758325

Dark, disturbed, and at the end a good message.  Artwork was amazing, music was dead on.  Story might have been a little simplistic and the villian was kind of corny, but other than very good.  It goes on my best list.  And I am sick and tired of the dragonballz, pokemon, types; this is the exact opposite.  It is like: Akira, Escaflowne, Neon Genesis.  Not like (thank god), Pokemon, Dragonballz, other corny anime.",1167177600,5,577,4.471153846153846
1691612,4,B000063K2C,"After reading some of the glowing reviews on this site, I opted to pick this series up. I was immediately hooked upon watching the first episode, and I can honestly say I remained hooked up until the last minute of the last episode.

First let me say I watched the series in Japanese with the subtitles on. I have nothing against dubs, I just felt that a series with such a reputation for darkness would be better to read, with the voice acting being only peripheral and to demonstrate via tone what the characters were expressing and what emotions they were feeling. I mention this only because I can't really comment on the quality of the english voice acting.

The character designs recall some of Miyazaki's work, maybe mixed with elements of Astro Boy or something of that sort, but it somehow fits rather nicely. Shu, the main character, is a Japanese boy, and obviously so. Lala Ru, the young girl Shu meets and tries to rescue, looks fairly plain, but maintains an eerie presence thanks to her pupil-less eyes. Hamdo, the mad king of the fortress Hellywood and essentially the main villain, is delightfully unnerving in appearance with a strange bowl-cut and teenage mustache. His female second-in-command, Abelia, is obviously attractive but not in the usual anime super-exaggerrated style. Overall the designs serve their purpose well.

The plot is at the same time simple and deep, should you choose to look beyond the surface. Basically, it's about Shu getting swept into a hellish future thanks to his attempt to save young Lala Ru, whom he had only just met, and his struggle to survive and save her from her captors. Beyond that, it's a show about themes - the gruesome consequences of war, the way violence both dealt and received can alter different people's views, the question of whether or not one can maintain hope in the face of unspeakable horrors, the insanity of blindly following leaders without question... the list goes on. It is these themes that make the series truly shine, as the simplistic overall plot serves merely as a vehicle for these ideas.

My only real complaint is that in the end, few things are explained, but if one is willing to overlook that, they'll find a rewarding and beautifully executed 'idea machine' of sorts that does not disappoint.",1154822400,3,2289,4.816793893129771
1691613,2,B000063K2C,"This series might be considered a classic if watched by a 12-year-old, but adults will see though the indistinct plot and characters. Most of the plot's famous ""unpleasantness"" is just tacked on to the main story, and is of no significance.

Apart from putting several of the characters though lots of physical abuses, nothing much gets accomplished thought the series. The main female character clocks about 100 words of dialog across the entire series, so don't bother waiting for any meaningful information from her. The male lead has the typical task of pointing out all the flaws in the alternate world he's been transported to, inbetween having the stuffing beaten out of him.

The most arbitrary abuses are handed out to a young woman, who's included in the story for no reason except to be abused- you can almost hear the writers saying, ""I got it! Let's rape a little girl, that'll make it REAL! Yeah, Yeah, I like it!"" Having served her purpose, the character then vanishes until being plopped back in near the end of the series, so a little more misery can be dumped on her.

All the characters suffer from lack of depth and motivation. The releative standout would be the villian, who suffers from bipolarism, and alternates between terror, anger, delight, and misery, somtimes all within the same scene. Too bad that was about all he did in the show.

Well, that's about enough. If you have an appetite for ""Kid saves alternate universe"" themed anime, then you may like this. But I found it lifeless and massively overrated.",1154736000,17,1537,4.8106060606060606
1691614,5,B000063K2C,"To be completely honest, I was fooled by the first episode of this series. It was so light-hearted and innocent that I couldn't have possibly suspected what was to come. Then, as the series got on, and I began to understand the dark undertones of this series, I got the feeling that I was watching something more than a simple ""Alice in Wonderland"" adventure.

The story follows a young boy named Shu, a brash kid with enough energy to share with ten people, as he finds himself in a strange, desert world (this starts after the first episode) after battling to save a blue-haired girl from some mysterious, robot-piloting soldiers in his home town. In this world, away from where he grew up and went to school, Shu is at instant odds with the leading force here, and must not only battle to save Lala-Ru (the blue-haired girl) but keep himself alive as well. Ultimately, he ends up the prisoner of a mad king and suffers terrible tortures until the king is satisfied that Shu knows nothing more than what he's has admitted to. So, Shu becomes one of the child soldiers in the king's army. Still, he simmers at the circumstances of his enlistment, and eventually makes his escape. Outside of the influence of the king, Shu meets a group of people who are the only ones capable of putting up a fight against the mad king, and as is expected, Shu decides that he should join them. Naturally, a terrible battle ensues in which Shu becomes involved.

The story in Now and Then, Here and There, continues to get more and more dramatic as every episode begins and ends, and as new characters are introduced and lives are lost, it becomes easy to get so deeply involved in this sentimental and violent story that you actually feel the emotions. It was just well done, through and through.

Now and Then, Here and There compares to Green Legend Ran in a lot of ways, but is much better in my estimation. It also has a lot of similarities to some early Miyazaki films, such as Nausicca and Castle in the Sky. Note, though, that my recommendations go for an older audience, not for the younger audience that is the target of Miyazaki films. Yes, this animation has an innocent look, but this story definitely isn't for a younger audience. Thirteen may be too young, but a lot of the worst that happens (including rape and torture) is implied so that does make it a little better. Fifteen or higher would be better, though. Either way, this is a great box set to own, as it's very cheap (thirty bucks for an entire series) and has all of the original material found during Now and Then's first DVD release. Plus, it is a powerful anime with a dramatic, plot-driven story.",1146873600,2,2660,4.5375
1691615,5,B000063K2C,"This is probably the hardest anime to watch that I've ever seen.

I made the ""mistake"" of watching most of the final episodes in one day, and I was irate for two days afterwards. It's that powerful.

Virtually all of the worst aspects of what humanity is capable of are presented here. I have seen the series all of once, and I would still recommend it to anyone over eighteen in a heartbeat. It's really that good.

If you ever wondered just how moving animation can be, the only comparison is Grave of the Fireflies. Now and Then, Here and There, however, is not sad, so much as infuriating.

The artistic style is an old (though still well-used) style, rather than any of the more realistic styles that were in use at the time. Make no mistake, the choice is deliberate. The older style conveys a much more innocent and childish image than the alternatives. It seems totally inappropriate, but from experience, I can say it highlights, rather than masks, the cruelties and wrongs perpetrated by the characters. The colors, on the other hand, are beautifully harsh oranges, yellows, reds, and browns, which do a splendid job of bringing home the harshness of the climate and the people.

I do not particularly recommend letting anyone at all under 16 see this, but parents do and should have the final call. I offer this advice: minors should not watch this alone under any circumstance.

I strongly recommend watching this with someone on hand for emotional support, because it's very troubling, very emotionally wrenching, and very much worth the experience. It's just overwhelming at times.",1146700800,4,1595,4.824175824175824

This is what I'd consider a Drama, though in its examination of human ethics and will, it really is too sci-fi.  Simply put, the series puts to shame many a Hollywood film, able to do in one episode what it takes Hollywood directors 2hrs to do.

The Japanese track is definately the one to go as it has the superior audio performances of the actors (the English track takes itself way too lightly, too ""cartoon-y"").  Audio is otherwise clean.  Another reviewer says in terms of animation, there are better.  That's true of course for one looking for money shots aplenty;  conversely, NOW is a marvel of understated composition, the visuals breathtaking in a way that is not immediately apparent.

I'm not prone to simple or cheap sentiment, to easy tears and such, but this is one of the few animes to bring me to that point, it's so very well done, tragic, and beautiful.  Yes, it is violent, but it's not gratuitous in the least, each blow and spurt of blood serving a purpose and making a statement.  If you only own a few animes, definately, pick this one up!",1144022400,2,1331,4.569620253164557
1691617,5,B000063K2C,"I will try to provide a short version of what is going on in these shows. The main protagonist enters, or to state it better, he gets dragged into a parallel dimension. At the beginning he doesn't even realize what is going on there, something that he will find out soon enough because he starts his adventure there in captivity. The story evolves around the protagonist and that he faces a war which is in its peak, where mainly children are participating. Children that have been taken with force from their parents and afterwards they have been brainwashed.

With him, in captivity, is another girl from earth which has to go through hell as well. The amazing thing about the protagonist, and I mean amazing literally, is that although really bad things are happening (children get killed, raped and so forth) he still manages to stay optimistic and fight against the oppressor who is completely insane, in contrast to his first officer.

As for the animation it is not one of the best that is out there, but a very good one. The shows are definitely not for children and are very violent. As for the storyline, it is a very, and I mean, a very good one and very powerful. It makes you wonder what can happen to people if they have to give up their rights and freedom, how a human being can overcome his or her misfortune, to keep on fighting and so forth. And it also has a good ending. However, keep in mind that in most of the shows people will get really angry with what the oppressed people are forced to go through (the reason is that the shows manage to give to the viewer a realistic impression of things).

To conclude, I accidentally came across the shows and to be honest they are certainly worth the money and your time. I undoubtedly recommend these shows.",1143590400,2,1772,4.496894409937888

This is one of the best drama anime series I have ever seen. This series is almost like Escaflwone but very depressing as in There Is No Hope. I don't like to spoil reviews by revealing things about the story so I only encourage readers to see it.

This is such a powerful anime show that it starts to make you feel for the characters right off the bat. Some things in this story are hard to understand like why lalaru acts the way she does even after act's of good she holds the same face only smiling here and there, and why shu will stop a nothing to protect her, he is so concentrated on protecting her that he doesn't think a lot about his parent's or sister but he makes you love and respect him for his strength and dedication.

Even though this is a depressing story Shu brings a little hope back when it seems to be completely gone. Now and Then Here and There will leave a very strong memory in your mind and make you appreciate life and see that there are things worse than death. Even though this is anime it shows what a lot of children in the world suffer and to see a child this brave and strong go through this and still keep the will to survive will inspire all viewers.

This collection consists of all three volumes plus a bonus disc full of extras in a flimsy but effective case. This collection is scheduled for a price cut in half in June 2005. A wonderful show in 4 DVDs for around $25 is no brainer.,1117670400,2,319,4.423728813559322
1691624,2,B000063K2C,"First, the good points.  The animation and character design is excellent in this series.  Characters look more-or-less realistic (although Abelia's bust seems disproportionate to the rest of her body, but let's just ignore that).  The colorization is appropriate and creates the right mood of desparation and desolation.  The action scenes are top-notch; creative, fast-paced, and exciting.

The bad parts?  The story and the characters.  Which are, arguably, the most important parts.

The plot isn't necessarily bad.  It's a good science-fiction story: a kid gets sucked into a twisted future (or alternate reality, depending on how you interpret it) and is pitted against a tyrannical, insane king.  This plot could have been transformed into something brilliant, but it ends up failing.

The main problem with ""Here and There"" is that it tries to be two things at once: a science-fiction action-thriller war epic, and a dramatic, high-brow exploration of the complexities of warfare.  And therein lies the problem.  You can't have it both ways unless you work very hard to maintain balance between the complexities of war and science-fiction fun.  ""Here and There"" attempts to have its characters engage in discussions on humanity, warfare, and the value of life---but these themes are awkwardly introduced and overly-simplified, and the series suffers considerably for it.

For example, let's look at the character of Sis.  When she is introduced (late in the series---episode 7, I think), she tries to teach us the value of non-violence.  Sis's philosophy then becomes the primary focus of the next few episodes, with Shu coming to the conclusion that ""violence is bad.""  This would be fine (after all, I believe in non-violence, too), except that Sis also uses physical abuse to reprimand her 6-7 children.  When Shu attempts to use violence to solve a problem, Sis punches him in the head and says, ""Don't use violence, you idiot.  It doesn't work.""  This sort of contradictory nature continues up until the end of the series---and it never really gets explored beyond that.  We are asked to believe that war and violence are despicable evils that must be avoided, but they are used all the time in the series to resolve conflicts successfully.  In the end, it's impossible to tell what the series is trying to say about peace and war because the themes are so muddled.  This isn't to say that confusion is a bad thing in a series/movie, but in this case, it doesn't work out very well.

Another major problem: the only two characters with any real depth (or character arch) are Sara and Nabuco---and neither one has nearly enough screen-time.  Remember how I was saying that the series overly-simplifies big issues?  Sara and Nabuco are the only two characters who seem to deal with these issues the way real people would.  Both Sara and Nabuco represent important, real-life conflicts that tear people apart, and both characters spend much of the series trying to resolve their internal conflicts.  But they rarely appear in the series except as plot devices in order to get Shu's story moving forward.  What ends up happening is that you see Sara and Nabuco for two minutes and you say, ""Gee, I wonder what will happen to them next?""  And then for the next twenty minutes the show focuses on Shu and Lala-Ru, who, quite frankly, are one-dimensional and boring.

At one point, the series even touches on the topic of abortion and takes a decidedly pro-life approach to it.  Within a five minute time frame, the topic is brought up and dismissed with the simplistic sentiment: ""Life is too precious.""  Whether you're pro-life or pro-choice doesn't really matter, but when you're talking about a serious, controversial topic like this---especially in the context of sexual assault and teenage pregnancies---then you have to have a more in-depth exploration of the subject before you flippantly say, ""Life is too precious for abortions to happen.""  In other words, you can't just bring up a firestorm of a topic and then casually dismiss it.

The ending, which I won't spoil for you, is incredibly weak.  Any credibility the series might have goes right out the window in the final two episodes.  It's in the climax of the story that characters make the most illogical choices and the series becomes, in my view, very offensive---we are forced to accept simple-minded views of the world for the sake of a conclusion that doesn't do justice to the magnanimity of any of the themes that are brought up by the series.  It's tough to describe exactly what I mean without spoiling the ending, but let's just say that it's very unrealistic.

Honestly, this series could have been very good if they simply ignored all of those Big Questions.  When you bring up a topic like the inhumanity of war, you either have to ignore it completely or explore it to its fullest.  If you just do it halfway, you end up with a very unsatisfying element to the story.  Such is the case here---it's like trying to read a book that has had every other line erased.

One more note---the violence in this series really isn't all that bad.  Most of it occurs off camera and the small amount that does occur on-screen is pretty light.  This isn't a graphic depiction of war---it's the PG-13 version.",1115683200,23,5278,4.912994350282486

1691628,5,B000063K2C,"This anime was gripping to me because it had believable characters and anti-war themes though there were some shortfalls in the story line.

""Now and Then, Here and There"" has characters whose qualities were realistic.  There was Nabuca who fights for Hellywood only so that he can eventually return to his village.  There is the ruthless and despotic King Hamdo who, for example, will give the order to fire a missile at an enemy battleship knowing that many of his own soldiers who have already been deployed will also die. Then there is Sarah, the kidnapped girl who is forced to serve as a ""comfort woman"" in King Hamdo's army and who manages to escape only after killing a soldier who is trying to rape her.  Sarah was an especially moving character because the story goes on to portray how she struggles to cope with her traumatic experiences of having been raped and of having killed a soldier.

This film is also thought provoking because it humanizes King Hamdo's soldiers.  Unlike Star Wars where the imperial stormtroopers are presented as undifferentiated masses, King Hamdo's soldiers are presented as people who each have different personalities and aspirations.  For instance, Tabool is seduced by the power and profit that comes with serving in the army and he is indifferent to the human cost of fighting.  By contrast, Nabuca, another soldier, struggles within himself about the morality of killing and enslaving other human beings.  There's also Boo, a boy soldier and Nabuca's friend, who courageously acts on his conscience twice when he both helps Shu escape execution and also when he refuses to shoot a group of village children during the siege of Zaribars.

Unfortunately, this anime resolves some conflicts in ways that are too artificial.  For example, when Shu and Lala-Ru are in the desert running away from a plant monster, they just happen to find a bag with explosives.  The monster, which I presume can only feel and not see, just happens eat an explosive inadvertently so that it blows itself up. Moreover, the fact that Shu, an Earth person who had never been to Lala-Ru's planet before, was able to find the town Zaribars without any guidance either from Lala-Ru or from a map also seemed to be too improbable in the story.

Though ""Now and Then, Here and There"" doesn't have animation that is as high-speed and lifelike as Armitage III and though its story is too contrived at times, it nevertheless offers an array of individualized characters who are vividly portrayed as each struggles in his or her own way to deal with the hardships of war.",1104796800,2,2583,4.856492027334852

1691630,4,B000063K2C,"Now wait, don't get the title wrong...I ENJOYED watching this series but it REALLY depressed me. It was probably some of the best anime I'd seen in a long time...nothing since Trigun or Cowboy Bebop has moved me quite so much. Heck, those are almost tame compared to this one (although Bebop and Trigun are still killer). I hardly ever have felt such anger, indignance, sadness or depression over a set of characters and a story. Only at times does Here And Now even have a moment you could deem 'heart-warming' and I think I laughed maybe once in the first ep. when Shu rammed his head into a pipe accidently. That's about it.
After meeting a mystical girl named La La Ru (nice name...ick), a goody-goody boy named Shu is transported into the hellish future of Earth. He is taken captive into the cruel empire of the tyrannical and totally nutty King Hamdo. There Shu faces a whole other plane of reality...one of utter cruelty and depravity. A place where kids are brought up as cannon fodder for King Hamdo's noble war effort to take over Earth. A place where they are taught to kill, follow orders to the T, and die for King Hamdo if necessary...A place where most females are seen as sex objects or only useful to bear more children for future soldiers (that incensed me the most).
Our main hero, Shu, is like a younger Vash the stampede...he hates killing and violence, his motto is ""Things will get better...as long as we're alive, good things will happen"". As chumpy as he may come across, he's the only ray of light in this series and the only beacon of hope for those he comes into contact with (Nabuco, Sara, Boo, etc.). He stays his optomistic self to the very end, despite the fact that he gets the brunt end of so much brutality (I just kept marveling at his strength every time he'd get beaten.) He's also somewhat unbelievable yet an amazingly good hero. He strives to rescue La La-Rue from Hamdo's grasp and puts up one of heck of fight to keep her away from the king because she plays a very important part as you will find out.
So many different other characters with such distinct personalities, you won't forget them. There's the childish and mad King Hamdo whom you will utterly deplore yet he will also amuse you from time to time by his kooky antics. His cold, unflinching right hand woman Abelia, who for some reason puts up with him. Nabuca and Boo, two soldiers who have been brainwashed for so long into killing for Hamdo but are changed after meeting Shu. The kind Sis of Zari Bars and her loving family. And probably the character that breaks my heart the most, Sara, an earth girl taken from Shu's time as well. Her
plight depressed me the most...
What can I say? I watched this series attentively...seldom did it ever get boring. In fact, I'm the kinda person who gets sucked into something if its good and really lets it get to me. That's what happened with Now and Here...and that tells me its a good anime. I recommend it whole-heartedly, but be warned it will most likely put you in a funk...I know it did me. Oh yeah, this ain't for kids...it shocked me at every turn (I'm 21).
I just bought the VHS tapes separately, but instead of reviewing all three apart, I thought I'd do them together because I think its a cohesive story on a whole.

1691632,5,B000063K2C,"As the first episode of Now and Then, Here and There opens, we see Shu, the protagonist, dashing downstairs to eat breakfast, which he wolfs down with endless enthusiasm, until his sister tells him she's heard that he's going to ask a girl out if he wins the day's kendo match, at which point he sprays beans out of his mouth across the table at his father, who, without even looking up, lifts up the newspaper he's reading as a shield.
Soon after, he's sucked into another dimension where children are forcibly drafted into an army and forced by the deranged, Caligula-like King Hamdo to carry out genocidal raids on peaceful villages.
And that's what immediately strikes one about NaTHaT: Shu is an unapologetic, goofy, exaggerated ANIME character, yet he's juxtaposed with a relentlessly grim setting--something that I personally had never seen before; contrast it with Grave of the Fireflies, for instance, a similar work in some ways, except that the characters don't clash with the background, because they're a PART of it.
I fear that this sort of cartoonishness in such a dark show may confuse, baffle, and generally turn off a certain sort of person, and that is too bad, because NaTHaT is certainly the best anime I've seen recently.  Shu's resilience notwithstanding, there are parts of the show which are simply hard to take.  What a lot of reviews seem to gloss over is that it does have its quieter, happy moments, but these only go so far; NaTHaT is not a show that pulls its punches.  It's not always fun, but it's necessary nonetheless, both as an unflinching study of lost innocence (the kidnapped children--one of whom appears to be around six years old--are quite a punch to the gut), and as a powerful anti-war allegory (sadly, more necessary than ever right now)--made all the more powerful by the fact that it's far from one-sided.
It doesn't matter whether or not you like 'anime' as a general concept; you should watch NaTHaT regardless.  I saw it subtitled, but from a cursory check, the dubbing seems pretty good.  Either way, it gets my seal of approval.",1058745600,7,2082,4.788300835654596

1691635,4,B000063K2C,"This has honestly got to be the saddest movie/tv show ever created. Schindler's List is a walk in the park next to this. Old Yeller was a joke next to this. Grave of the Fireflies would make you happy after watching this. Titanic was a cheerful movie next to this. Saving Private Ryan shows just a glance at the horrors of war. This movie is just as sad as it gets. Think about anything thats horrible in life and this movie has it -death, torchure, rape, suicide, murder, apathy, genoside, yeah, its all in here. Saying ""enjoy the show!"" is like saying ""Wasn't mom's furnal fun!"". Now, I personally didn't cry, but I haven't since... gosh i don't think i ever have in a movie, i just gasp in horror. Honestly, if this movie doen't at least make you sniffle or give you a lump in your throat, you have one icy cold heart.
Onto my real review....
Okay, now that I got that out of my system, I'll tell you a little bit about the series. The main character, Shu, (who tends to be overly optimistic, but if he wasn't the movie would fall apart crying itself to death) ends up in a war-torn future (to make a long story short). Little kids are kidnapped and made into soldiers, the so called king is mad and calls this the holy war which will end all wars. The story takes different view points to see how the war effects differents types of people.
It sort of reminds me of ""Candide"" by Voltaire which i read in school. It really makes you think about why bad things happen, and what the meaning of optimism is.
I think part of the reason this movie really gets under your skin is because of its animation. The characters are somewhat childish and innocent, and look like they might come from dragonball or cardcaptors. This innocent style really makes you think differntly about war. Instead of tough looking guys beating each other up (making them look like they deserve it), you have innocent looking five years olds shooting guns just to keep themselves alive.
I'm not going to tell you to if you should watch this or not, because it's really for you to decide. This movie is increadably sad and somewhat emotionally involving, so if you're up to it, goahead and watch it and be moved. However, if you're the type of person who already hates the world or is suicidal, go watch Tenchi or Spirited Away instead. I could be wrong though, maybe you might be touched by Shu's optimism.",1051401600,10,2380,4.448512585812357
1691636,5,B000063K2C,"Now and Then, Here and There, from the very first episode, struck me as being one of the most beautiful anime series I'd ever seen.  The art and direction are spectacular and make the darkness of the world all the more haunting, the nicer parts even more refreshing.  The characters are complex and extraordinarily intriguing and you feel pity for them when they suffer - and in many cases, suffer they do - and joy when they get moments of happiness.  And the storyline keeps one riveted from end to end.  From the interrupted tranquility of the first episode to the gentle hope of the last, N&T,H&T is one of the finest anime works in my collection.
That said, it is brutal.  The main villains are among the most contemptible individuals portrayed in this kind of medium, and their bloodthirsty will for power literally angered me when I was watching the show.  There is severe brutality inflicted upon the unfortunate children of the world of Hellywood.  Beatings, in one case a rape, the like.  It can get depressing, severely so, and should probably be watched in a group for that reason - but it does deserve to be seen.  Perhaps it's not really ""enjoyable,"" but that's not the sole purpose of an animated series.  If you can get through the difficulties, there are things that are really beautiful about this show.  They're more than worth it.",1050105600,40,1350,4.677966101694915
1691637,5,B000063K2C,"This movie moved me.  It depicts the hardships of everyday life.  How good and evil will always exist, and the search for absolute power will always bring about the destruction of mankind.  Its a story about love, death, happiness, sorrow, guilt, and pleasure.  It shows how man will always dig himself a hole to obtain his wants rather to live life with his needs.  Not a lot of movies scratch the surface trying to touch such deep subject manners.  This movie touches all of the above and some.  It ranks up there with my favorite films no doubt.  My only advice is just to view this film and get ready for a rollercoaster of emotions.",1044835200,3,637,4.478260869565218
1691638,5,B000063K2C,"First off, this isn't like most anime you have probably seen.  The subject matter is very mature, and really not for younger viewers.  This series describes the events on a different planet ruled by a mad king and his effects on the population on the planet, but mostly the children.  A boy from Earth is transported to this hell planet and finds himself in the middle of things from the start.
There are numerous depictions of graphic violence, like killings and torture of children, so if that isn't what you're looking for, this isn't for you.
The story is a powerful one about survival against horrible odds and never giving up ones morals.  This anime is similar to Grave of the Fireflies in intensity.  I highly recommend this to people looking for more mature anime that has a story that will grab you.  You will remember this one for a long time after seeing it.",1042934400,11,870,4.580645161290323
1691639,5,B000063K2C,"We showed (with the gracious permission of Central Park Media and US Manga Corps, of course) ""Now and Then, Here and There/ima soko ni iru boku"" at the anime club at NC State University, during the spring semester of 2001.  Retrospectively, I must say that this series has affected my perception of the entire scope of Japanese animation in a way that few other series have.  The simple art style and character designs contrasted with the depth of the world and the reality of the characters' emotions depicted in this should-be classic set a mood that will keep you hooked until the very end, and leave you with a feeling that you won't soon forget.  Therefore, it garners my highest recommendation.
However, a few words of caution:
Many people in the club (and around the internet) either prejudiciously or prematurely decided to label this series simply as ""depressing.""  While depression is certainly a complicated thing, I feel that classifying the show with merely this one word is neither sufficient nor just.  I feel that what makes NTHT powerful is the breadth of contrasting human emotions that it deals with (hatred and love, fear and courage, despair and hope, betrayal and trust, sadness and cheer, resentment and absolution, you get the point.)  While there certainly is a bleak and meloncholy tone throughout, there are also many movingly triumphant moments - the main character is, after all, undyingly optimistic and devoted.
So, please... resist the urge to categorize NTHT, and simply buy it.  If you expect something canned, something similar to what you've seen before (perhaps another Ranma 1/2, or Dragonball Z, or Cowboy Bebop) you'll be sorely disappointed, and you definitely won't be won over by the stunning beauty of the artwork.  As you know, it is insufficient to judge anime merely by the frequency and intensity of action scenes, or its comic releif, or by the detail of the animation.  In the case of NTHT, I belive that if you have an open mind, you'll find NTHT to be a deeply character driven story that's well worth your time and money.",1041379200,10,2074,4.886039886039886

The next night, I rented the rest of the series-glad I did. The whole story is just awesome. Even though the hardships and issues the children are facing are horrendous, it really gives you a picture of how children really suffer in a world without law.
Each character in this series is just amazing. You really feel for every one of them, from the evil Hamdo to the little boy, Boo. Each situation and background really hits home.
Shu's pureness and good heart really touched me. Kabuca's (don't know if I spelled that right) horrible situation where he is forced to murder innocent people just broke my heart. Every character was portrayed and drawn magnficantly. The story is very well written.
This anime is for someone who is looking to be challenged mentally and emotionally. Be prepared to see terrible images of little children suffering and people being faced with brutal predicaments. Yet, to some people this is real life. I believe it is good to know that bad things do happen, however a strong, determined heart like the main character Shu can change one world's terrible dilemma.

1691646,5,B000063K2C,"I watched a few episodes of this when it was shown by AXN Asia in Singapore. I decided to buy the DVDs after reading over three or four good reviews. I agree with some of the reviewers that this show is not for everybody. I am not sure how to describe the targetted audience. It can be emotionally draining. I believe I can say that after having watched all 13 episodes back to back.
Subsequently. while I loved the show, I agree with the reviewers who dislike the English dubbing. I don't agree with some of the character interpretations. I may not speak Japanese, but there are places where the vocal inflections do not seem to agree with the original. Based on the available translations and the context, I preferred the original. Furthermore, I found it difficult to put some of the voices with some of the characters. On the other hand, the interpretations may have been for a more ""western"" audience. I grew up in Singapore, so my point of view is probably colored by this.
Episode 1 - 5
  I think these episodes are slow, and spend quite some time establishing the backgroud to the characters and the story. Nonetheless, key events occur in these early episodes that add a great deal to the story.
Episodes 6-7
  I believe these episodes have more action and the pace picks up for a while.
Episode 8
  This episode has a few conversations between Shu and Lala-Ru that I cannot find words to describe at this time.  The title ""Night Chat"" stands out the most. There is some action.
Episode 10-11
  I believe that these episodes return to a slow pace. They introduce more characters and a real twist to the plot. A lot of  conversations take place and makes the story shine.
Episodes 12-13
  I think these episodes bring the whole story together. I believe things happen very quickly. The speed of it left me with a lot of mixed feelings. It also left me wanting to continue following the lives of some of the characters. I really would like to know how Shu and Sara move on from their experiences.",1024617600,7,2003,4.518005540166205
1691647,5,B000063K2C,"It's a wonderful film, high in its characterizations and interactions.  Here's the lowdown on the film as far as genre, content and art style.
Genre: Drama/Sci-Fi.  It is more a drama than a Science Fiction, though it contains elements of Sci-fi, unexplainable technology and distant future/alternate dimenional settings.  It is mainly a drama pitted together in a horrible situation.
Artstyle: Realistic, similar to the Gundam Series, Princess Mononoke, Vampire Hunter D.  Lacks the common anime features: exaggerated facial expressions (blown up eyes, river size tear trails), exaggerated bodily features (larger than life breasts, muscles where muscles just aren't).
Violence:  High level.  Bloody corpse, blood.  Brutality, cruel behavior.  It suggests rape twice and shows an attempt at rape.  There is no needless violence, every notion of violence has an emotional and psychological impact on the characters.  The rape scenes follow in the same pattern.  This is a tasteful film which paces its violent scenes in full context with the story and the development of the characters and their situation.  Not suggested for young children.
Setting: In foreign land/world/time (described as the distant future by many sources).  Postapocolyptic, during a great war.  World is under an extreme drought, water is very valuable (this is a main issue in the film but does not superscede the situations of the characters.
Themes: Finding ones place in life; Doing what is expected Versus Doing what is right; Survival; The value of Life.
Jist: I don't know what it is with the Japanese and Guys with sticks helping a helpless girl (ICO for example).  You have a guy saving a girl.  From the beginning until the end this is what it is mainly about, though involving many other characters.
I find the most important element of this film to be its characters.  They are so diverse in their own way; there aren't a hundred different characters but each comes from a setting, sometimes similar with others, but they all have completely different situations.  A lot of the situations start from one main point: being forced into another way of living.  The way they deal with it and their exact way of living is different.  Shu's situation is the main focus, as is obvious from the beginning of the film.  After becomming invovled with Lala-ru he is determined to help her.  She is probably the most influencial character, every character is effected by her either directly or indirectly.  But Shu is the only one that is intent upon saving her, some even hate her.  You'll find a lot of mystery surrounding her; her name is known apparently world wide and many rumors and speculations are going around about her no one really quite knows why she is so important to the King, excpet the King (obviously) and his closest and most loyal servant Abelia.
If you are an Anime fan then this should be at least viewed if not in your library.  All three are wonderfully set with 13 episodes that don't let up or fill between.  It's kinda like a 13 part OVA.  I would highly recommend this for fans of Princess Mononoke, Vampire Hunter D/bloodlust.  Young audiences may not be suitable for the violent/graphic/realistic nature of some themes and instances and these instances and themes may not even interest young audiences to begin with.  It is a movie about emotions, and they can be heavy at times.  I quickly added this to my library, give it a rent in the least.  There are many more amazing things i could say about this film, but i'd probably give it all away (it doens't have any Sixth Sense style surprises though).
Everyone i know of that has seen it has loved it.  It'd adorable and powerful.  And they all loved Abelia just as much as they loved Sara",1024358400,93,3744,4.882725832012678
1691648,4,B000063K2C,I love anime of all sorts. This is no exception. But some might see this anime as too slow in the beginning. Also some of the things just plainly make no sense. Most animes try to explain why things happen in certain ways but this one didn't even try. The story is nice in other ways and the animation with the story board really helps you understand how creation of anime comes to be.

The pacing of the story may be slow at times for people who grew too fond of the 90s era of Japanese animation, fast paced, lots of shoot'em up, little time for reflection TV serials.  Rather this harkens back to the better developed series of the 70s and 80s, with the sophistication that has been born out in the more recent Japanese feature film animations, like Metropolis, but with a fully flushed out story.

Eventually I managed to get my hands on a copy of it, and I was not disappointed.  The reviews for Now and Then, Here and There do not give unfounded praise for the work; I watched the episodes over the course of two days, entranced by the world of the series.

The story is about a young boy who is transported to a different world, possibly a far-future version of Earth.  Like an Orwellian dream, water has become scarce, and a few powerful military leaders have gained control of great battleships capable of obliterating towns.  The culture of that world is divided between the followers of a despot attempting to take over the world and the few farming villages that are attempting to carve their own path without being subdued.  The action is fast-paced, bleak, and at times very graphic; I would not recommend this series to anyone under the age of about 16.  The message, however, is hopeful and bright, and you can't help but feel that unbounded optimism is what drove the creator of the series to write such a beautiful story.  There are no filler episodes, and the way the story progresses leaves no holes in plot to make you think there might be more to the story.

7959656,3,B000063K2C,"Many people here have written about this anime series' greatest strengths; it's unwavering portrayal of the sickness of using violence, especially forcing children to obtain power and resources at the cost of all else.

However, for me there are some issues. I would have liked the series to have gone a couple more episodes to fit in more character development for the main protagonist, Shu Matsutani, rather than just leave him as an unchanging hyper-optimist. It would have been interesting to see Shu go through moments of doubt in his beliefs, and maybe see him nearly sucumb to temptation to join Hellywood when offered power in exchange for Lala-Ru and her pendant.

For the villian characters, King Hamdo is a disappointment. How did this guy ever get in charge of anything? He's clearly very nearly rendered dysfunctional by his insanity. So was there ever a point he wasn't insane? His brief moments of apparent, frighteningly cold lucidness hint at a man of intelligence and capability. But why does Abelia follow him, or anyone else, for that matter, if he was always the way we see him? It would have been nice if the writers had put in a scene or two with some lines giving more of the history of Hamdo and Abelia, and what the man was like before that he could inspire such loyalty in her that she would gladly do any atrocity for him. Maybe it would have been interesting to find out they were lovers at one time, and she's in denial that the man she fell in love is slipping away from her day by day due to his progressively degrading mental condition. Yes, make Hamdo a sympathetic person, too. Maybe he WAS a great and wonderful man before his illness, and was loved because of that. Certainly many real life dictators have started off as idealists looking to find a way to improve their peoples' lives, but somewhere along the way are corrupted by the power they wind up in possession of.
