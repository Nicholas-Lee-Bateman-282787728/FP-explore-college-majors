8328582,2,B001O0J68C,I was expecting more tips and tricks.  Was disappointed with contents.  Not the same as having someone work with you.,1375488000,,117,4.8
8328583,4,B001O0J68C,"Really enjoyed the series.  My only criticism is that it ended too soon!  Well worth the money.

I am a novice player",1365638400,,117,4.2272727272727275
8328584,2,B001O0J68C,too much shooting and clearing the table and not enough direction on the shot making. pretty disappointed. I bought all 3 dvd's unfortunately and they are all the same.,1361404800,,168,4.827586206896552
8328585,5,B001O0J68C,"I read many books and seen many other dvds. Everytime I play pool at a poolhall, a party or club/bar; people are amazed by the talent I have. This set of dvds really improved my performance at billiards, snooker, 8ball, 9ball. I hardly ever lose and have a lot of fun meeting and playing other players. It was worth every penny, very easy to comprehend these lessons. Impressing people with the trick shots and wining money and kisses, amount other things. Order this you won't be sorry at all.",1297555200,,494,4.561797752808989
8328586,5,B001O0J68C,"I've seen a fair number of instructional pool videos over the years, all of which bored me to tears. I'm sure the information in them was useful enough, but what good is it if you're sleeping through it?

Mika's videos seem to have changed this. They offered tons of content that is presented in a very professional manner.....and most importantly, they're a pleasure to watch. My only minor criticism would be that we don't get to see enough of Mika's personality. He's like a machine in these movies....running rack after rack. It would be nice to have seen the more casual side of him.",1243900800,3,588,4.653846153846154
