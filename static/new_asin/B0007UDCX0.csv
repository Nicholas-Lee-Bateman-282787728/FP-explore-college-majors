2244527,5,B0007UDCX0,"Quantum Leap is the best show ever made and this is an awesome season.  Some of the best episodes were in this season.  I hope this isn't edited and shows the wrong teasers like the second season DVD did.  Even if it is, I'll still buy it.  The following episodes were in this season:

The Leap Home

Leap Of Faith

One Strobe Over The Line

The B-Man

Miss Deep South

Black On White On Fire

The Great Spontini

Rebel Without A Clue

A Little Miracle

Runaway

8 1/2 Months

Future Boy

Private Dancer

Piano Man

Southern Comforts

Glitter Rock

A Hunting Will We Go

Last Dance Before An Execution

Heart Of A Champion

Nuclear Family

Shock Theater

This season begins with The Leap Home and ends with a teaser for The Leap Back.  It also has the Halloween episode, which is pretty creepy.  Notice how I censored the title.  Fans do not mention the name of the episode, because it has been known to bring bad luck along with causing cable stations and VCR's to fail.  I say buy this DVD and relive some good memories.  If you haven't seen the show, buy it anyway, because you will enjoy it.  If not, you're missing out.",1108944000,7,1124,4.331707317073171

2244567,3,B0007UDCX0,"Hmmm ... well, although the excellent two-parter, ""The Leap Home"" is here, many of the storylines went a little ""kah kah"" this season.  I think they were running out of ideas.  However, the good episodes are well worth it.  Got tired of the bad-guy shows, boxing, rockers, etc.",1405814400,,277,4.729166666666667

2244574,2,B0007UDCX0,"Some of the most touching and moving moments from this series was because of the outstanding selection of background music from the time that he appeared.  On Netflix, those soundtracks are preserved.  Unfortunately, on the DVD sets, they are not.  What a shame!  I bought the entire series at once, not knowing this.  VERY disappointing.",1389052800,4,338,5.072727272727272

2244577,5,B0007UDCX0,"My favorite Quantum Leap episode is The Leap Home. What a wonderful story of Sam traveling back to his teenage years before his dad dies and his brother is killed in Vietnam. In Part One Sam realizes the value of time spent with his family. This time around he does everything he can to make their lives better. Then in Part Two just when he thinks he failed to save his brother's life in what he refers to as ""a hopeless cause"", he leaps into Vietnam with him and is in his Seal Unit. Again, Sam does everything he can to save his brother's life. I won't reveal the ending but encourage you to watch these two episodes even if you never watch another one. Very, very heartwarming and a perfect movie to watch at Thanksgiving.",1383868800,,726,4.345588235294118

2244589,5,B0007UDCX0,I feel in love with Quantum Leap when it first aired on TV!  Thought it would be wonderful to have the collection.  Wound up giving it to my son who had just discovered the series and was falling in love with it too.  He had a wonderful marathon with them!,1364256000,,256,4.08

2244591,4,B0007UDCX0,I was able to enjoy viewing and hearing most of these episodes again.  I read the reviews about the music editing and I do agree it lowers the emotional impact of a lot of the scenes.,1360108800,,183,4.083333333333333

2244596,3,B0007UDCX0,"I'm pretty upset over the fact that they decided to remove a couple episodes when putting these discs together. Disc two specifically they skip over three episodes. And I remember these episodes he leaps into a guy on a boat where his old flame is getting married and she still wants to be with him so the fiance tries having him killed. The second one missing he leaps into some kind of cop, I believe he ends up being a dirty cop, he is trying to protect a witness who is a pain in the butt woman while these others are trying to kill her. And the third missing episode he leaps into a single mother of two with a teenage boy having girl troubles that runs away and ends up getting kidnapped. I clearly remember these episodes but for some reason they don't exist anywhere. I can't find them listed on any episode guide, they're not on the dvds anywhere. It boggles my mind.",1342224000,2,876,4.315151515151515

I love the adventures of Dr. Sam Beckett, Al and Ziggy!  I was in love with this show as a kid and remembered hearing they were taking it off the air and was VERY Disappointed.

Now that I own all of the seasons I realize how many episodes I missed as a child!

When the DVDs do actually play, they look like I made a copy with a pudding covered VHS tape. On some episodes I can almost see through Sam if he has on black. The black levels are horrible. The coloring is just plain off. Colorized versions of old Gilligan's Island look better than this. Also, I thought I could get past the music part, but OMG it just sucks. Next time let me record some Casio songs and throw them in there... it'd be better! The music was such a part of the show.. I feel ripped off in every way buying this. Seasons 3-5.

2244610,3,B0007UDCX0,"Ladies and Gentlemen, take my advice... go to amazon.co.uk and order the British releases of these DVDs, if you have a player that will support them.  They use the ORIGINAL music, not the stuff on the DVDs released in the U.S.  Also, if you do the conversion, they cost the same if not less even with shipping.  Please also do not order the British complete package, as you cannot play the final episode, according to several posters.  Get each season separately.  It adds up to about the same.  I live in VA and it was only 12 GBP to ship all five seasons.  Well worth it, if you want the series the way it was intended.  My two cents...",1200441600,,638,4.302521008403361

2244614,3,B0007UDCX0,"I love QL.  I remember when I was just a child that even then I enjoyed the show when some of the material is over my head.  Through the years I picked up watching it on Sci-Fi and when they came to DVD I bought them.  Like everyone else, I love the series but the collection of each season was cheaply put together but still high-priced for the consumers.  It's not quite fair to consumers to receive a collection that's not complete and it isn't without the original music.  Some of the tunes they used to fill in what they took out are cheezy elevator-like music that really ruins a moment.

But on the plus side, this is a dvd collection that I feared never being released to public.  I am happy with my purchases of seasons 1,2,4, and 5.  But my season 3 DVD set is messed up and it's angering.  One out of every 4 episodes are unplayable and within minutes of starting it, it stutters and skips.  I'm lucky to be able to watch half of the episode and even then I miss half the story.  Does anyone else have this problem?  If so then future purchasers of the DVD collection ought to put that technical issue to consideration before purchasing.  I'm going to try and send my  season 3 back and get another just in case the one I have is a fluke.

Yes as a collector of TV series the alteration of the broadcasted episodes to fit in a DVD set is disconcerting to diehard fans. And since the MPAA and cohorts don't want us to copy episodes for even our own personal use anymore, its gonna get harder for collectors and fans to get the complete stuff "" legally"". Sure, I don't like the  alterations from the broadcast version of the episodes. And yes in some of these assorted TV DVD series the company acts as if we should thank them for releasing any episodes at all, no extras.

 I will still buy the series because even altered, its still good. I highly doubt the production company will make "" specical versions"" of the series, but if they do, I might buy those as well.

To the companies that release these DVD sets, do you understand why we WANT complete episodes and bonuses? Why do we have to resort to scrounging for tapes and personal dvds and you folks make us feel like criminals for doing it? The demand and interest is there for complete episodes. Maybe in a decade or so all TV episodes will be on DVD, even the cruddy series. But we don't have that yet. And some of us don't have that patience.",1142985600,6,1218,4.328947368421052

2244622,3,B0007UDCX0,"Why Universal has to torture us with the commercials that are at the beginning of the disc - & difficult to avoid on some DVD players AND having to sit through 2.5 minutes of the same introduction for every episode - is beyond me. If they at least would put a track change at the beginning of each episode it would be tolerable, but no, when you hit the ""next"" button during the intro you're taken a couple of minutes into the beginning. Then there's the Universal ""musical"" (using the term loosely) Logo which quickly gets on one's nerves after one hearing. Then again music, is not a Hollywood strong point to begin with. The double-sided discs probably enhances the bottom line a bit but does nothing in the reliability dept. especially on older DVD players.

It's really too bad Universal has to be the one to have its claws in this series - as well as a host of others - because after getting through the opening dreck the shows are really quite good. Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell carry the show beautifully. The sheer variety of subject matter is a joy to behold, especially if you take the shows in order. I'd give it 4.5 - 5 stars for the series if it weren't for the aggravation that  Universal subjects us to.",1134604800,9,1222,4.450892857142857

My issue is this: I too have had problems with DVD-18s made by Universal, most notably 'Casino' & 'Schindler's List'... the kicker is that the stores will not refund the movie because of copyright laws... they tell you to get another one which freeze and skip also. So due to these problems and Universal's refusal to spend an extra few cents to make another disc(for Ray, Blues Brothers, Cinderella Man, Schindler's List, American Gothic, QL, etc infinity), I am BOYCOTTING Universal DVDs. Warner Bros. stopped making doubled sided disc with 'E.R.' & 'West Wing', why can't Universe-smell do the same thing? simple: MONEY. PROFIT. Send them a message, folks. Because this will be the only way they will listen. I shouldn't have to wonder if a movie is gonna play right when I buy it... simply pathetic.

  I just started watching the show last summer and I love it,but for you people who are freaking out b/c ,OH NO, the music is not in it's origanal format, grow up. You people aren't going to move me all the way to not buying the sets b/c the stupid original music is missing. I agree I like the music too in its original format and I agree the sets do need to have some more extras but whatever. I agree with all the other people who say ""whatever, it's not like I am going to sit and watch 24/7 to the extent I know exactly what song is missing and where,not to mention learning every detail of the show"".

I don't care what music is on there b/c I won't remember it in 2 hours anyway.

2244626,1,B0007UDCX0,"I have a few issues with this set. First the discs are DVD-18 (i.e. dual-layer, double sided). I have four DVD players and the discs won't play in three of them. They will play on the fourth, but it ""hiccups"" and hangs for a minute or more on pause randomly. Sometimes it will just skip around 5-10 minutes randomly making them impossible to watch. I bought the set when it came out and have only made it through four episodes.

Second, the touchy subject of the music. I have to side with the ""why bother"" camp. If you aren't going to do the set right, I don't want it. I've been tivo'ing and DVR-ing season 4 & 5 off Sci-fi, just for this reason. They won't get anymore money off of me unless they release them right. It wouldn't be so bad if they subbed out lesser known bands/music from each era to save on money, the feel would still be the same, but the muzak pieces are an abomination. The biggest offender(from season 2) is Ray Charles's ""Georgia."" This song is integral to the character of Al and is even revisited in the finale. The scene in question is(was) very moving and touching. Now it is a hollow shell of its former self. Just an example of how music changes the show.

2244627,5,B0007UDCX0,"First, I honestly couldn't tell you what songs, if any, were changed in the Season Three DVD.  In any event, I'm not outraged - that's not what I watch this show for.  Most TV shows don't have actual popular music on their soundtracks anyway; that Quantum Leap did (or does) only adds color.

But it's the performances and writing and creativity on this show that makes it stand out nearly 15 years later.  Even its weakest episodes (one or two in Season Three, a couple more in Seasons Four and Five) were ultimately better than most anything else on TV then or since.  Especially in Season Three, I don't know how they picked one Emmy reel from all the great choices.  (Bakula was nominated for ""Shock Theatre,"" an episode in which he plays 6 different personalities, none of them Sam Beckett).

As a product, the DVD set would have been better if it had included bonus features, such as outtakes or even the kind of episode commentary by Bakula that the Season One DVD includes.  Regardless, just being able to watch the episodes uncut and commercial free makes the set worth every penny.",1125273600,5,1091,4.616580310880829

2244629,4,B0007UDCX0,"I enjoyed this show growing up, and it's been really great getting these first three seasons on DVD. Season three has what may be the most touching show of the entire series with ""The Leap Home - Part One"" when Sam leaps into himself at the age of 16. And while season three really introduces a more ""politically-correct-social-message"" element to the show (specifically the heavy handed Watts Riot episode), most of the shows still hold up well a decade plus later. ALSO for Friday the 13th fans...in one leap Sam lands in a magician who is struggling to keep his daughter in a custody battle, and his wife is played by Amy Steele from ""Friday the 13th part 2"" and her lawyer/boyfriend is played by Erich Anderson from ""Friday the 14th IV"", which I thought was kind of cool.

2244632,5,B0007UDCX0,"So the 5 stars are for the TV show itself. This is a great season of a great show. Now I admit that the fact that I am writing a review on this show makes me a geek to some degree, but I believe your level of geekhood might make a difference on how much you would enjoy or hate this DVD set.

I watched it when I was a kid and I didn't memorize what songs appear in what episode, so the whole ""music problem"" isn't that big of a problem to me. I bet you're right, it probably would be better with the original songs, but I don't even know what's missing unless I sit and read the other reviewer's extensive complaints of missing songs... and that's kind of pathetic.

Quantum Leap is not the center of my existence, just a good show to watch. If you like to watch TV shows with great characters, good acting and a quality plot, this is a good buy for you. On the other hand, if you are somebody who has devoted their life to Quantum Leap (having named each of your 5 cats Ziggy) and you have each song and each screenplay memorized so that you can quote each line and sing each song to yourself as you sit in your parents basement wearing your ""What Would Sam Do?"" T-shirt, this might not be the best buy as you may be overly-disappointed by the overly-mentioned ""music problem"".

What I don't like about these DVDs is the fact that they are double sided discs and that there's not any extras at all. I hope they will still release the next two seasons even though these jokers are boycotting these ones.",1119916800,4,1504,4.197231833910035

I will always remember the great times I had watching the show air for the first time.  Unfortunately, I have no copies of the show on VHS, but I would rather just go on with the memories of a great show than to purchase the tatters left here.

Perhaps to other people it is, but to me, it isn't worth my money.

Quantum Leap is one of those shows where the music is crucial aspect of show; the music is not just some background noise; it sets the mood.

2244637,1,B0007UDCX0,"Having read that Universal once again mucked up the music, I won't be buying Season 3 of Quantum Leap.  There are some shows in which the music doesn't really matter - Laverne & Shirley's first season, for example, mentions on the box that the music is different, but the songs in Laverne & Shirley are merely incidental, background sounds.  In QL, the music was a major part of the show, helping to set the time period, helping to set the mood.

I have read some of the reviews from people who claim that the change in music makes no difference (generally such comments are written in a boorish, bumptious, hectoring tone, a fact which I find rather interesting and quite telling).  No?  Close your eyes and imagine the Lord of the Rings movies with elevator music instead of the soaring splendor of its real score.  Ponder ""American Graffiti"" with the sort of synthesized slop that has replaced the original music in QL.  Then try to tell me that music doesn't matter.

The choice is not these travesties or nothing for most QL fans; it's a choice of a poorer-quality taped-from-TV video with the real music, taking up more shelf space than a DVD set; or a better-quality picture with no commercials that has had much of the atmosphere stripped from it.  I'll take my tapes, thank you very much.  If Universal comes to its senses and releases QL in unmangled form, even if it costs more, I'll buy it.  Until then, count me out.",1116633600,16,1429,4.586614173228346

Scott and Dean do their best work when the story really gives them the chance and the episodes of the third season really give them the best chances of the entire five-year run! It is pure pleasure to watch them perform. It is a shame that they only got five years! They could have gone on for many more!!!

(BTW, if anyone is confused by the other reviewers complaints about the change in the music, don't worry about it. What you heard on TV is what you get. They didn't change the music for the DVD release - which is exactly what I thought they were complaining about!) So buy this DVD set! You won't regret it!",1116201600,5,757,4.256944444444445

2244640,5,B0007UDCX0,"""Quantum Leap"" hit its stride during the third season. The show had dramatic episodes just as powerful as season three but this was the most consistent season for this classic TV series. During the third season Sam leaps into a KISS type rock star (complete with dramatic make up and with Scott Bakula doing his own singing!); into himself at 16 where he must change an event in his own past; Sam also leaps into a Navy Seal in Vietnam serving under his older brother where Sam faces a unique dilemma. Is Sam there to save the life of his older brother (who is fated to die the next day), insure the success of the mission or for some other mysterious reason? The series at its best managed to convey the best elements of drama: Sam never knows why he's there and what he has to correct which leads to many emotionally powerful and genuine feeling moments during the third season. What brought the best episodes home were the performances by the series two mainstay performers the marvelous Scott Bakula (""Enterprise"") and acerbic Dean Stockwell as Al who appears only as a hologram and must guide Sam with information from the future.

If Sam Beckett had been able to truly leap back through time during his life time he would have been able to foresee the licensing agreement issues that prevent his TV series from having the original music in it and prevented it from being replaced. Some of the original music survives but it depends on how instrumental it was to the episode. By the way, Bakula's nice performance of ""Imagine"" is intact for ""The Leap Home Part I"".

Aside from an occasionally grainy or soft episode, ""Quantum Leap"" looks exceptional here. While there are still analog flaws in the form of occasional dirt and irregularities in the prints used, the colors are bright, image quality sharp and vivid (with the exception of those episodes using stock footage). The 2.0 stereo soundtrack also sounds quite crisp and vivid. Dialogue is, for the most part, very clear and the music comes across with nice presence.

I was hoping that Sam would figure out how to hide some extras from the past for Universal to find when transferring this to DVD. We get an episode guide on disc three that lists which episodes are on which discs (which might be an extra if it served any useful purpose such as having trivia about each episode). We get an onscreen synopsis for each episode before playing the episode and a synopsis on the back of each slimline DVD holder. The big difference here is the redesigned packaging. Gone are the accordion holders which threatened to scratch the dual layered, dual sided discs for each season. Instead, we get individual slimline holders for each disc along with a synopsis on the back of the holder giving a brief description of each episode (much like the DVD version included as well). Missing, however, are some of the promo photos that adorned the accordion style holders. I miss them. It's a pity that Universal chose not to adorn the inside of the paper sleeves in each slim line holder with photos for the inside.  It does appear that these are the uncut original episodes as they aired on NBC.

This is an area where Universal continues to lag behind just about every studio. Would it have hurt Universal to provide commentary by Scott Bakula (particularly since he recently filmed a cameo for the new ""Quantum Leap"" TV show), Dean Stockwell (he appears in the new show as a regular) or even creator Bellisario? ""The Leap Home"" parts 1 and 2 would have been a perfect set for commentary tracks.

 ""Quantum Leap"" continues to look nice in its DVD transfer but it seems that Universal is rushing out ""product"" which really does a disservice to the fans. This particularly set was designed to coincide with the release of ""Enterprise"" on DVD and the last two episodes of ""Enterprise"" airing on UPN. Synergy can be everything but it can also add up to nothing particularly when ""product"" is rushed out to meet a predestined release date or tie in. Universal, please do it right for the last two sets of the series. This fine series and its fans deserve better.",1116028800,83,4107,4.672199170124482
2244641,2,B0007UDCX0,"I read a review that music isn't important to the movie, that it is the drama that sells it.  I think it is all aspects together that turn a good show into a GREAT show.  What would Jaws be if you did not have the da-dum da-dum music playing?  I have to agree on the side that not paying for the rights to the songs is a horrible mistake.  I underestand the fact that it ""may cost a small fortune"", but you also have to realize that a great many CUSTOMERS will be paying you for including those songs.  So losing the customers may cost a small fortune as well.

If the person in charge of securing those rights thinks that sending out a product that is substandard, and believes that it is worth losing my money rather then making a product that exceeds expectations, then I am sure he will not be upset if I just pirate the original.  I mean what does he/she care?  I am not condoning copying, but it seems that all they wish to do is send out a product, as cheaply, and as quickly as possible, without thought into what makes the product worth buying.

I mean this product has no special features, incorrect music scoring, and frankly I do not see where they put any thought into it at all. I think they just took the remastered shows and burned them to DVD and sent it out.  Again, as cheaply and as quickly as they felt they could get by with.  Substandard.

I understand they do not see this as a major release, but just giving up brings me to the conclusion is that they do not care.

And Quantum Leap, as the fans have shown, is a show that needs someone who cares making the decisions.  - This is just my opinion.",1115942400,8,1621,4.187096774193549
2244642,5,B0007UDCX0,"After reading these reviews I can tell that a lot of QL fans can't see the forest but for those leafy green things in front of them (ie the trees). These DVD sets have 22 episodes on them, running about 17 hours and yet some obstinate fools refuse to buy them because a few songs were changed, totalling less than 5 minutes of screen time. That would be like going to the Louvre and going right back home because you found that the Mona Lisa wasn't on display, forgetting the thousands of other brilliant masterpieces that were on display there. And don't give me that condescending garbage about not understanding the value of music or having little appreciation of art. I have a solid understanding of what music can mean to a film or TV show. But I think it's more important to have great drama than great music. Can anyone whistle the music being played when Rhett says to Scarlett, ""frankly my dear, I don't give a damn""? Was there music being played when Stanley yells STELLLLAAA or when Colonel Taylor finds out where he really is in Planet of the Apes? If so, I don't recall it. Music can be important yes, but for crying out loud, you people are acting like someone sprayed graffitti on the Sistine Chapel. Music is just one part of a great TV show or film. Acting, writing, directing, cinematography, sets, costumes, casting and a million other things also go into it. To dismiss a DVD package of a fantastic TV show just because a few songs were changed is narrow minded and nit picky. Oh well. I'll just sit back and enjoy immensely the 3rd Season of QL and laugh at all you chumps who are going without, simply because of a misguided principle. And I had to laugh when the reviewer below pointed out that the ones who are complaining loudest at the music being changed would be bellyaching equally as loud if the DVDs were more expensive. How true that is.",1115942400,15,1869,4.483870967741935
2244643,4,B0007UDCX0,"This isn't really a review but rather an exlanation of how incidental music rights in television shows work.  This is the lesson that was learned with the television show, ""WKRP in Cincinnati.""  When the show originally runs, any non-original music that is played, such as popular songs by famous artists, must be paid for.  The purchase of one-time rights is affordable and quite acceptable for the show's producers.  But buying rights for re-broadcast in perpetuity would cost a small fortune.  That's how song copyright works.  To begin with, the network and producers wouldn't dare gamble that the show is going to be so popular in syndication or DVD release as to justify the vastly increased price.  In addition, however, they would have to probably triple or quadruple the price of DVD sets to cover the expense even if they DID shell out for the rights.  The problem here is purely economic -- NOT artistic.  I'm sure the producers would love to keep the music that aired on the show in tact.  I'm also sure very few of the complainers here would pay the hugely increased price that such a move would demand.",1115942400,10,1116,4.765625
2244644,1,B0007UDCX0,"But I tell you what, it mattered to the director, to the viewers and to say that music doesn't matter is simply nonsensical. I check ed out this 3rd set and I am not buying it. Universal con'ed us with Season 2 and make no mistake, the music is essential. How does it differ to change the music (which in this series was a character as much as the actors) to edit our actors, change the ending or what have you? To add to the insult, what Universal is adding is truly elevator music, done on a synth in 2 minutes. I love this show, I love the idea, but I for one can't watch this butchered show. If you can, and you truly think, music that was intended to be in there as a plot point, doesn't matter, good for you. Don't tell John Williams. Or James Horner. Or Mike Post........",1115856000,10,778,4.125
2244645,3,B0007UDCX0,"I couldn't help it!

Although Season 2 was edited beyond belief I still went out and purchased Season 3 on DVD. I know, I know. I should fight ""the man"" that is Universal, but I was jonesing for some QL.

After reviewing many of the arguments here on Amazon.com, I can sympathize with both sides. One, it truly is a shame that the original music was cut out and to me the show just isn't the same without the intended tunes. On the other hand, it's this or nothing. When I watch these episodes with the dubbed muzak, I occasionally lean towards the ""Well, I'd rather have nothing"" attitude. When I watch great episodes like ""Glitter Rock"" and ""Future Boy"" I smile that I am able to watch these episodes commercial free on DVD.

The fact is Quantum Leap is a great show without music. It's a brilliant show with the original music in tact. Unfortunately, we will not get what we want and we have to come to terms with that. I know that sounds cheesy, but it's true. We're Quantum Leap geeks and purists that want to relive the leaping experience, uncut in all its glory. Well, Universal doesn't seem to care. QL is just another show to them and another source of funds for their Home Entertainment department (if that's what you want to call it). That's why they just plop it out on shelves with zero TLC. They changed the packaging to slim line cases -- which would have been cool if they had done it in the first place. They botched up the artwork with cutout heads of Sam and Al on bodies from different pictures and included photos in Season 2 taken from Season 4. They gave us double-sided discs for pete's sake and didn't even bother to clean up the picture quality!!! We have a lot to be ticked off about!

But what can we do? We've written our letters, voiced our complaints and unless someone knows how to break in and become the Head of Home Entertainment at Universal...we're SOL.

I give this season 3 stars instead of 2 (as was given for the 2nd Season) for one reason. On the back on the packaging, there is a disclaimer ""music may differ from televised version"". Thanks for the heads up, Universal. It only took you 3 seasons to tell us, you bunch of jerks! Well fellow leapers, at least it proves that they heard us, even if it came across as a faint whisper.",1115856000,11,2274,4.37914691943128
2244646,5,B0007UDCX0,"This truly is a great season DVD set of a very great show. Standouts are The Leap Home two-parter, and the season final Shock Theater, arguably the best episode of the series.

I don't want to belabor the discussion about replaced/missing music too much, but it is sadly missed. I have not watched these episodes the number of times that some have, so I didn't notice a lot of the changes, until I got to Season 2's ""Another Mother"" with it's incredibly horrible music replacements. I don't know what was played there before, but the ending credit music is like nails on a chalkboard. Thanks goodness that ""Imagine"" on The Leap Home is intact. I couldn't see the episode working without it.

If you want to see ""how it should be done"", check out the greatly underrated short lived series ""Freaks and Geeks"". The series has a great soundtrack and its creator went to GREAT LENGTHS to gather the rights to 99% of his series' music. Though to accomplish such a feat he had to leave the studio and go with an independent distributor to get his great achievement out to his fans. It's also important to note that this disk set cost around $50 on Amazon, but its well worth it.

Does it make sense to pay more for an intact series with original music? It does to me, and I would gladly pay the additional for a ""complete"" QL set. If you're a fan of the original ""Star Trek"" and ""Twilight Zone"" series, you're paying from $70-90 per season anyway. So what's $50?

I'll gladly buy Seasons 4 and 5 of QL, but, Universal Studios, you can do much better!",1115856000,5,1543,4.460992907801418
2244647,1,B0007UDCX0,"I will keep this short. The seasons of Quantum Leap outside of season one are not the original artistic vision. Yes, the writing may be the same, the acting may be the same, but the music is not. Anyone who argues that music is not relevant in a film is utterly ignorant and has no artistic appreciation whatsoever. Imagine watching Star Wars sans the Star Wars theme because they couldn't get the rights to have it and replaced it with a generic sounding muzak. While this sounds absurd and never would happen, it serves the point. Music is very relevant to the experience and it affects our emotions and perceptions of what we see on screen. I, for one, will not be buying this DVD set nor any of the subsequent DVD sets. It serves as the only protest I can offer to this shoddy product.",1115769600,15,789,4.410958904109589

2244649,5,B0007UDCX0,"I for one am absolutely outraged that they changed the music for some of the episodes of Quantum Leap on DVD. Forget the terrific writing. Who cares about the heart warming chemistry between Bakula and Stockwell? Top notch acting from both stars and guest stars? Who needs it!?! One of the most interesting premises of any TV show ever, guaranteed to keep the show fresh throughout its run? To heck with that! Darn it, they changed a handful of tunes that play ad nauseum on any oldies station, and that just gets me so angry I have to bore everyone else to tears with this review.

If you're really that upset over those few missing songs, then just download them from a legal source, burn a CD and listen to them while watching the show. That way, you can save the wasted bandwidth and stop boring the rest of us to tears.

In all seriousness, the only complaint I have about the DVD series is that the picture is very grainy on my HDTV and 1080i DVD player. The producers of this DVD set could have used the money they saved from not paying royalties to the owners of the aforementioned moldy oldies and done a little remastering.",1115683200,3,1133,4.4423076923076925

This season has some of my favorites, the top one being Shock Theater. I really enjoyed Scott's performance in this episode because he really got a chance to express his versatility as an actor.

The scenes between him and Al are always touching and funny to watch.

I wish they could have done more with special features, like cast interviews or commentary, as they've done with other series, such as Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. But overall, the 3rd season of Quantum Leap is a must for your collection.",1115337600,17,684,4.636363636363637

The show is EXCELLENT 5 STARS,the replacement of the muisc makes it 3 Stars.

2244656,5,B0007UDCX0,"Despite its short run (March 1989 - May 1993), Quantum Leap is nevertheless one of the more memorable dramatic series in television history. Although the show borrows from a concept employed in other realms, such as Highway To Heaven (with its theme of a mysterious force interceding to transform a single life), it adds a unique twist by utilizing elements of science fiction. Created by Donald P. Bellisario (creator of Magnum, P.I., JAG, and countless other hit shows), Quantum Leap developed a loyal cult following, making its short network run all the more difficult to understand...

Quantum Leap stars Scott Bakula as Dr. Samuel ""Sam"" Beckett, a cutting-edge experimental researcher in the field of physics. Developing a theory that an individual can travel throughout the span of his life, Beckett builds the Quantum Leap Accelerator and uses himself as the test subject. But rather than traveling within his own lifetime, Beckett finds himself mysteriously transported into the lives of various individuals, each of whom faces a problem Beckett must rectify (thus changing history for the better). When he does, he can make his next ""quantum leap"" (which he hopes will restore him to his pre-experiment self). Aiding Beckett on his various missions is Rear Admiral Albert ""Al"" Calavicci (Dean Stockwell), one of the quantum leap experiment observers who periodically appears as a hologram in order to communicate with Beckett. With each new episode, Beckett finds himself in a new body, facing new circumstances, with a new mission he must decipher and complete if he ever hopes to return home...

The Quantum Leap (Season 3) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the season premiere ""The Leap Home"" in which Sam first leaps into his own life, giving him the chance to win his high school basketball championship. Sam then leaps into the lives of other people associated with close family members, as well as those associated with Al, who was a P.O.W. during Vietnam... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Miss Deep South"" in which Sam must come to the aid of a wrongfully disgraced beauty pageant contestant, and ""A Little Miracle"" in which Sam becomes an employee of a wealthy contractor displaying many of the characteristics of a modern day ""Scrooge""...

2244659,5,B0007UDCX0,"OK - Season three had some of the best quality episodes of QL of the entire series. Bakula began to get more involved, even directed some. And the adventure was in top form. This show deserved all the praise it got back then for being new and innovative. (just think of the QL type clones that have come along since - SLIDERS, PRETENDER, JOHN DOE...)

Now to my point of writing here - I noticed that very few people seem to be writing reviews of this season. After all - how could they? The dvds are not out yet and they have no way of knowing what they are reviewing. What people seem to be doing here is just bitching about the previous releases and about Universals attitude towards music rights and packaging.

This is supposed to be a review section based on the actual item in questions. An item, none of us have seen yet. I'm just appalled to see people miss-using this section.

It's like someone I saw review STAR WARS episode 3, and just bash it calling it crap. How does he know? And I think that if you go into it with that attitude, then you'll find a way to make it self-fulfulling.

Just like the people here. You'll hate QL season 3, because you are preparing yourself to hate it.

You know what QL is to me? Good writing, good acting, a thoughtful and provocative story that moves me, makes me think... I don't like it for the special features and all the extra bells and whistles. I like it because it is great. Any thing more than the episodes themselves is just bonus. Sure I think ""georgia on my mind"" is essential to the last episode of season two. And it sucks it isn't on there.

2244660,4,B0007UDCX0,"Television at its best is an artform, not just, as a previous viewer put it, ""virtually mindless"" entertainment.  And to make it that way takes the work of a LOT of people; the biggies, like the actors and the writers and the producers and the directors, and the lesser known but just as hard-working people in charge of lighting, and sound effects, and set-design. It's the directors job to, well, ""direct"" all of that effort into what will only be, in the end, a single 45 minute episode.  What's my point, you ask?

My point is simply this: it DOES matter, a great deal, when even a single element is out of place.  In the case of the last DVD set of QL it was the music that was sacrificed.  And it made a huge amount of difference.  Did it destroy everybody's work?  No.  But it made it less than it was originally.  And, frankly, I don't want to pay the price of a box set for art work that's been defaced.

If the DVD producers really didn't have the money to pay for it, that's one thing.  But the songs would have paid for themselves with the profits from the DVD sales.  It's nothing but greed that keeps them from remaining true to the show by leaving in the original music.  I hope they've decided to do better for the 3rd season, and keep to what was aired on TV.  If they have, then I'll gladly remove this review and change my rating to five stars, and happily gush about the incredible quality of this show.

They have a lot of nerve pulling this crap on us.  They are doing the same stuff with the NORTHERN EXPOSURE dvd's, and it is just a cheap way of shaving money off of their production costs because nobody wants to spend money to reacquire the rights to the music of these fine shows.

While season 1 was a passable effort: only 8 episodes @ full price but it included a small making of featurette and episode introductions, season 2 disappointed all with music replacements (most notable in `MIA') and NO special features whatsoever.

If your reading a season 3 review chances are you have seen or purchased the first and second seasons or are familiar with the show and already know of its quality and whether you like it or not. Suffice to say this is a GREAT season of a 5 STAR SHOW, highlights include: `The Leap Home Parts 1 & 2' and `Shock Theatre'.

So, should you pre-order this? Yes, IF - QL reruns aren't syndicated regularly at a reasonable time where you live and/or you don't have any of these episodes on old VHS tapes. OTHERWISE hold out until the release date rolls around, then come back here and check if there are any value added extras or if any music replacement significantly detracts from the storylines (see: 'Imagine').
