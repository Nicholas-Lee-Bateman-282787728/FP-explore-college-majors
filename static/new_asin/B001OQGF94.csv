3735755,5,B001OQGF94,This is a great tool for all level of cyclists. As we all know winter takes it's tole on the waist line. These well made DVD's bring the outside ride right in front of your trainer. No more boring rides in the basement. Well done Global Ride. I'm very much looking fore ward to new Global Rides in the future. Avery satisfied customer. Ferenc  Gyulafia,1234137600,3,352,4.415384615384616
3735756,5,B001OQGF94,"As a triathlete in New York, when winter comes around, cycling outdoors becomes impossible. Spinning classes and computrainers are great, but they do not give you the ""outdoors"" feel, the same rush of the road. This DVD was great for diversifying my training and stimulating my mind with gorgeous scenery, motivating music and a challenging route. I suggest for gym members that you ask your manager to buy a copy for their spin classes, and for those of you with stationary bikes, get ready to be in Hawaii...",1233273600,2,510,4.806818181818182
3735757,5,B001OQGF94,"This is an awesome DVD for anyone who wants to bring the cycling experience indoors. Beautiful footage, a challenging course, and great motivation makes this the perfect indoor cycling dvd. I felt like I was riding on the roads of Maui myself!",1233187200,,243,4.809523809523809

8331244,5,B001OQGF94,"I loved this DVD, great music and hills that seem to build higher as you train
starting with a misty climb up towards the sunshine and then releasing into a downhill.
the views are breathtaking",1374710400,,193,4.542857142857143
8331245,2,B001OQGF94,"The scenes were ok but the yoga lesson I was not interested in, this should have been all about cycling or a cool-down I would not
recommend this dvd.",1366416000,,150,4.206896551724138
8331246,2,B001OQGF94,The scenery is not very appealing. I was expecting some flowers in Hawaii! All not buy this type of DVD again.,1358899200,,110,4.285714285714286
8331247,5,B001OQGF94,Awesome workout with great scenery and motivational music and coaching. You can really get into and get your heart rate up. The bonus Yoga workout is nice too. Like 2 workouts in one.,1353888000,,183,4.575757575757576
8331248,4,B001OQGF94,"Not my favorite, I skip the first segment all together, but the scenery is beautiful and I got a little more into it as the segments went on.",1352851200,,141,4.071428571428571
8331249,5,B001OQGF94,"This is enjoyable ride. It last about 45 minutes which is perfect time for a workout to fit in a day. Enjoyable music, scenery and coaching. I bought other cycling DVDs that did not work.",1337731200,,187,4.371428571428571
8331250,5,B001OQGF94,"I have several Spinervals, some CTS's and Bike-O-Visions and this series is a fantastic addition to my indoor trainer-riding library. I also have StrenDurance.  The music is decent enough that I don't use my MP3 instead.  You can choose from different coaches, or turn them off.  The scenery is wonderful; the ride from the cyclist's point of view much more realistic than some other videos; PLUS the bonus features at the end are great - yoga, or strength conditioning or pilates depending on the dvd.",1323302400,,502,4.882352941176471
8331251,5,B001OQGF94,"This is high on the list of my favorite cycling videos. The surroundings were more lush and beautiful than most, and that makes the tough ride easier. I chose the options of ""with music"" and ""with coaching"" for my ride.

One thing I really like about this one is the fact that he acknowledges that some of us will be on exercise bikes and some on bikes with gears. He lets us know when to turn the dial up a bit and when we may want to stand, or not, biker's choice. It isn't an option for me as I am riding my recumbent bike, on which I can dial up a notch, or my elliptical machine, on which I can move up the resistance.

This ride can be done by anyone. You ride at your own level, although the American coach, my choice from the 4 available on this ride, did tell us there is no recovery on this ride. We were working for sustainability and endurance. I got a great work-out. I have one more of the boxed set and I can't wait to do it tomorrow.",1269302400,,949,4.015873015873016
8331252,3,B001OQGF94,"I ordered this product and received it very quickly, even though I selected the slowest shipping method. I would definitely order from this company again.

Before purchasing this video, I did a lot of research online for biking videos. This video had really positive reviews, so I felt excited to place my order. I was some what disappointed when I finally watched the video because I have been to Hawaii before and was expecting to feel as though I was there again. This feeling did not happen. When watching this video, I get the feeling that it could have been shot in AnyTown, USA. I'm not sure it was worth the money because of this reason.",1259452800,,645,4.560344827586207
