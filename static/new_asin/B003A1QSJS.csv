4099761,5,B003A1QSJS,This is an adorable movie. You will not be disappointed.  More and more I am watching the Korean Dramas...haven't turned on my television in 6 months as the Korean series and movies have so much to offer.  This movie is an example of why I prefer them.  Excellent actor and wonderful story.  Enough said.,1317945600,30,304,4.574074074074074
4099762,5,B003A1QSJS,If you like actor Jang Keun Suk you will enjoy this movie.  He is very good in comedy role.  His facial expressions to convey his emotions are marvellous.  The little baby is adorable . You will fall love with this little boy. The English subtitling is very good so I was able to understand what was being said and what was going on.  It can be so frustrating when the English subtitles are garbled and full of grammatical errors.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves to laugh.,1294531200,27,490,4.4

4099767,5,B003A1QSJS,I love Korean dramas and this movie is funny answer sad and with a good ending. Subtitles were from korean to English which is better than  other movies that have from korean to mandaring or mandaring to English on the same movie and is just confusing.,1481068800,,252,4.478260869565218

4099769,5,B003A1QSJS,"this is one of my favorites but the streaming quality ruins it all everytime.
Well, i don't bother watching anything on amazon prime as i have my other sources but since I am a prime member, wanted to take a look. But the streaming quality is quite poor and it seems like i'm watching a 240p movies in 42"" fullscreen. BTW, before questioning about the network speed, it's 150mbps uncapped full duplex. And also there's no settings for force stream at 720p.",1475366400,,456,4.573170731707317

4099771,3,B003A1QSJS,"The only likeable character was the baby because he's just so incredibly cute.
The female lead was not adorable but highly annoying, and didn't mesh well with the flow of the movie.  So, didn't really feel any empathy for the entire show.
Wasn't too impressed, especially after watching ""Hello Ghost"" and ""Couples"".",1471392000,2,315,5.0576923076923075

4099787,2,B003A1QSJS,This is NOT family friendly. I don't think the role models are good for teens. Overly clingy girl falls for very bad boy simply because he was cute. Our family turned it off half way. Good acting though and would be ok for grown ups to watch if you like silly movies.,1449792000,,267,4.153846153846154

4099808,4,B003A1QSJS,"Now THIS is interesting. Basically it is a comedy, but thematically it is also about how responsibility changes a young man who has had a reputation for skipping classes and having a quick temper. The idea of giving a voice to the baby is an old one, but it does not distract from the transformation of the hero. Bear with it. It has something to say.",1424390400,,351,4.333333333333333

4099819,5,B003A1QSJS,"I watched this on netflix, and this movie is one of the reasons why I'm addicted to anything Korean. It's funny, sweet, and an inspiration as the ""to cool for school player"" takes on the role of parent hood with no help from his parents but the occasional help from a girl who has a crush on him. I immediately bought this after I watch it.",1394064000,,340,4.166666666666667

4099823,5,B003A1QSJS,"Great movie!  All emotions included, and enough of a beginning love story throughout, so that it could easily have a sequel.  The movie centers around the baby who almost seems to be acting.  Smart writing, and lots of emotions,a fast pace and full of life's lessons, but no preaching.  Something for everyone - you won't get bored.",1379808000,,332,4.771929824561403
4099824,5,B003A1QSJS,"This was funny from the first scene and gradually incorporated sweet and adorable. I will watch this movie in the future when I have a bad day. I am certain that I missed at least a few jokes because I do not understand Korean, but there were enough other jokes it was well worth calling it a comedy. Highly recommended if you are looking for a comedy.",1373068800,,352,4.268656716417911

4099828,4,B003A1QSJS,"This was a sweet, sweet movie.  I've not seen these actors before, but they are excellent in this movie & the script is fantastic.  The story is wholesome and completely endearing.  This baby is absolutely adorable.  Lots of growing up is completed in this movie.

UPDATE:  Jang Kun (Guen)Suk has become one of my Go-To actor/singer for all things Korean.  JKS is excellent in this movie.  The final 5 minutes of the movie will have you reaching for the tissues.  BUT that said, it ends well.",1367884800,,492,4.627906976744186

4099834,5,B003A1QSJS,"It was funny and I liked how this movie promoted the value of abandoned baby with a main character who initially had no idea what to do with the baby (would rather throw away). Yes, I am a spectator who is not involved in this mess and is easy to judge him. I would recommend this movie to people in high school and early 20s but would not recommend to families that have minors because it exposes immorality of high school student gangsters.",1360540800,,442,4.337349397590361

Great Korean movie, I haven't laugh so much before.",1357948800,,366,4.169014084507042
4099837,2,B003A1QSJS,"Sorry, but this movie was very lousy. The acting was a soup opera style and the plot was aimed to teenagers. Not my cup of tea. Having seen other Asian comedies, this one is just overrated by Amazon viewers. Do not recommend this one.",1357603200,,234,4.340909090909091

I mostly got what I expected, it is a little bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Men-and-a-Baby/dp/B00005T7I2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Men and a Baby</a>&nbsp;with a dash of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Look-Who-s-Talking/dp/0767804309/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Look Who's Talking</a>&nbsp;but in its own K-Drama way.

JGS plays a high schooler (who I suspect is probably bored, his parents have spoiled him) who is always getting suspended or in various kinds of trouble.  He comes home one day  to find his parents have 'run away' from home (this premise alone cracks me up).  Being the responsible young adult he is, he calls his friends and tells them to plan for a party. As he is out shopping for said party a baby shows up in his shopping cart with a not informing him that he is the father.

This movie easily could have been turned into a series, so instead of in depth building of characters everyone is drawing in a very quick way, as is the plot. Luckily, since this movie is building on our expectations we can fill in the blanks that the time limits the movie from telling us point blank.

The female lead is adorable, and for her alone I wish this had been a series and not just a movie. Kim Byeol (playing a character with the same name, hah) is a ridiculously smart girl who wears some of the most hilarious pajamas I have seen.  She quit school because she was too much of an outcast--however upon seeing Han Junsu (Jang Geun-Seok) she decides to go back (seriously, his good looks do it). She is a quirky character who easily puts everyone in their place, but it is also pretty obvious she has a heart of gold.

I'd recommend this movie if you are looking for some mostly mindless fluff.  The baby is adorable (and I think having him have voice over dialogue is pretty unnecessary as he is a very, very expressive infant and what he is thinking gets across pretty well in other ways).  JGS is as fun to watch as he was in You're Beautiful (well, almost as fun, he doesn't sing in this and he lacks the dramatic guyliner).",1323302400,19,2501,5.357142857142857

It's not about a girl who sleeps with so many boys she doesn't know who the father of her baby is-it's about a high school boy who sleeps with so many girls he doesn't know who the mother of his baby is. So he has to ask a bunch of girls if they had his baby.",1320192000,5,460,3.8526315789473684

He's temporarily on his own, as his fed-up parents have recently ""run away from home"". While Mom and Dad relax at the local spa, the 18-year-old ""dad"" learns the fine art of baby care, with a little help from his friends and a single father's support group.  Then he brings the kid to school  and causes a minor scandal. Fine performances from Jang Geun Seuk, Kim Byeol as a brainiac girl who knows all about babies, and of course that adorable tot.

8392786,3,B003A1QSJS,"The baby was very cute. The actor who did the voiceover for the baby's dialogue had an annoying voice but the baby didn't spend the whole movie talking like ""Look Who's Talking"" so it didn't ruin the film and the few lines the baby did have were good. I agree with another review's opinion in as much as the female lead didn't really feel indispensable. I feel like that the chemistry between here and the baby was nonexistent. Overall the movie had it's moments and I do not regret watching it but neither would I recommend it. Unless you are really into babies this is just an okay movie.

8392790,2,B003A1QSJS,"Not sure why such a high rating.  The plot sounds good, but the flow of the movie are not logical at all, things just happened out of nowhere with no reasonable explanation.  Nothing connected.  For example, why a rich parent just left the kid and go to a homeless shelter for a simple reason like their son misbehaved in school?  What?  Who do that?  And why wouldn't the rich kid sell things in the house for money, but go stealing instead?  Makes no sense.  And what makes a fat, poor, unattractive guy (friend of the main character) to be able to sleep around and have a baby?  I meant ... can they find another attractive actor for the role.  I can go on, but there are just too many things that makes absolutely no sense.",1484092800,,727,4.318518518518519
