There's no real story, just a series of visits to locations around the world where water powerfully interacts with humanity, like the pilgrimage of 30 million people to bathe in the Ganges river.

Without narration and a specific focus the film could be accused of being too diffuse. But for me the raw power of the images  Burtynsky is one of our greatest still photographers who has spent much of his career creating huge images of humans and nature clashing and interacting - give the piece a poetic, if not literal, power and solidity. The film manages to be a wake-up call about our use and abuse of water while rarely giving in to traditional lecturing. It trusts us to look into its images and interpret for ourselves.",1446336000,,947,4.7560975609756095
