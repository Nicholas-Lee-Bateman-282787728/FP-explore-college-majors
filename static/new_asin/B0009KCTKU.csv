8062854,4,B0009KCTKU,"Beat The Devil
Humphrey Bogart famously panned this film.  Either he was too close to the action, or  simply ruing the money he put up to have it made.  In either case, he falls in with a motley crew of bandits led by Peterson (Robert Morley) and Julius (Peter Lorre) who along with Gina Lollibrigida as Bogart's wife, Maria Dannreuther, are themselves captured by other bandits as they come ashore in British East Africa in search of a uranium find.  Bogart's character, Billy Dannreuther, is grilled about, of all things, his relationship with Rita Hayworth.  After an interrogation like that, it's clear nothing is to be taken seriously. The screenplay is by Truman Capote, direction by John Huston; the film was shot on location in Italy.  Nobody made a nickel on this movie, it exists solely as a work of art and a monument to what can happen when quality actors, a great director and committed cinematographers assemble merely to have a ball.

The Swap
This early Robert De Niro film has authentic pretensions to drama as De Niro plays Sammy, a budding moviemaker who made the mistake of capturing  a politician's indiscretions on film and pays the price.  Most viewers will, however, make mental notes about De Niro then and De Niro now.  One thing will be clear: how hard he worked at controlling his body to respond to being shot, falling, dying.  Upon release from prison, Sammy's brother Vito reopens his own investigation into Sammy's death. The flashbacks are effective but the ending lacks suspense.

Blood On The Sun
Nick Condon (James Cagney) is a reporter for the Tokyo Chronicle who comes into possession of a document outlining plans for world domination by the Empire of Japan in this 1945 political thriller.  The Japanese government moves heaven and earth  to retrieve the document, and Condon is alternately framed, beat up, even shot while delivering hard licks of his own.  Iris Hilliard (Sylvia Sidney) is slippery playing both sides against the middle.  Instead of being fully developed in their own right, some of the Japanese characters merely play into popular stereotypes in place at the time of the filming.  Film audio is fine, but the print is contrasty and overexposed; viewers will need to adjust the brightness control on their sets to make the movie viewable.

The Boxer
Robert Blake is fighter Teddy Wilcox in the second movie of the set depicting boxers and the ills they fall prey to. They Made Me A Criminal features a fight manager who committed murder, here the manager is murdered and the boxer takes the rap.  In both films, the fighters wind up in places looking suspiciously like Arizona.  Catherine Spaak's emotionless delivery is hard to make sense of .  It's called for when she won't pick Teddy out of a police lineup and is threatened with perjury, but it's inappropriate when she talks to her father's killer, an unaccredited actor who might be Phil Mead as a glib psychopath who ""settles the accounts"".  One final similarity: in both fight films, the boxer gets the girl.

The Klansman
Lee Marvin is Alabama sheriff  Track Bascomb, but Richard Burton is not Southern, doesn't have a Southern accent or a Southern name.  What his character, Breck Stancil, does have is arrogance aided and abetted in the extreme by righteousness - an above the fray quality that makes it difficult to take his side, or even keep him alive.  Sheriff Bascomb explains this several times but Burton's slurred alcoholic inspired mumble yields only stubbornness.  He is seen walking into town ripping down posters whose politics he disagrees with and we're left with the impression what he's really after isn't persuasion, but humiliation of the townspeople in his Southern hamlet already inflamed by brutal rape and racial intolerance.  In a way, his incoherence is perfectly attuned to his conflicted vision.  ""You've voted down every project these people want,"" Bascomb says.  When the Klan attacks, Stancil says, ""Why can't I get help?""  ""I asked every man in the county,"" the sheriff replies.  Like Stancil himself, this film is public domain for a reason.  Nobody wanted it.

They Made Me A Criminal
John Garfield of The Postman Always Rings Twice fame stars in this 1939 film as middleweight boxer Johnny Bradfield who is framed for a murder he didn't commit.  He goes underground, re-emerging in the Depression era Arizona countryside, at a home for wayward youth.  He becomes a role model for the teenagers, although past and present merge when suspicious New York gumshoe Monty Phalan (Claude Rains) turns up at a local boxing event, and has it in mind to bring Johnny back to New York to stand trial for murder.  Academy Award winning cameraman James Wong Howe (The Rose Tattoo, Hud) did the cinematography and made the film notable for its authentic depiction of Depression era road scenes.

Gold
This disc should have contained the 1974 movie ""Gold"" starring Roger Moore.  Instead, it contains the 1932 film ""Gold"" with Jack Hoxie.  I remove one star for this glitch.

Man In The Attic
The escapades of Jack the Ripper are the subject of this 1953 film starring Jack Palance as Slade, a mild mannered hospital researcher by day, a nomadic phantom at night unable and unwilling to account for his whereabouts except to say he's been conducting ""experiments"".  Whether this makes him Jack the Ripper or not is hard to say based on the circumstances in the film.  Constance Smith as Lily Bonner, an actress of the Paris stage befriends Slade and begins to suspect his real identity.

The Snows Of Kilimanjaro
The first of two adaptations of Ernest Hemingway's work included in this compilation takes place in one of Papa's favorite locales, the plains of Africa.  The movie takes it's title from a short story Hemingway published in Esquire magazine in 1936, the same magazine that championed the work of F. Scott Fitzgerald when he lost his audience at The Saturday Evening Post.  The film makes effective use of flashbacks to compare and contrast the primitive allure of the country and its deathly pall with the sophistication and liveliness of the Paris bar scene.  Comparisons are also made between what people had in the past, and what they have now.  Gregory Peck is writer Harry Street; alternately delirious and remorseful about his predicament, his wife Helen (Susan Hayward) a patient listener, even as Harry reminisces about past loves. While Fitzgerald glorified the past, this film seems to stress that all we have is now.

Quicksand
Mickey Rooney as auto mechanic Dan Brady can't catch a break and gets shaken down time after time for bigger and bigger stakes in a didactic classic intended to show ""what a tangled web we weave when at first we do deceive.""  He pulls a gun on a motorist who turns out to be a kindly lawyer (whew!).  When he ditches femme fatale Vera Novak (Jeanne Cagney) and reunites with his loyal admirer Helen (Barbara Bates), we know there's hope down the road and he'll get the shortest prison sentence possible. Noteworthy for the hyperkinetic energy Rooney gives his part.

Death Sentence
A taut murder mystery, courtroom drama, and bravura performance by Cloris Leachman as a housewife selected for jury duty and slowly realizing the defendant may be innocent and she must look elsewhere to find the guilty party.  Alan Oppenhiemer, her husband, is a model of probity and restraint coaching her through her doubts as the evidence begins to point away from the defendant.  Obtuse courtroom angles highlight her inner turmoil  while Nick Nolte, the defendant, initially gives the jury every reason to convict.  His modish hair, head bowed forward, give the impression he is hiding the truth until he takes the stand in his own defense and his denial of involvement in the murder of his wife is low key, clear, and unwavering - the perfect prelude to a riveting and tense finale.

A Farewell To Arms
Gary Cooper is Lt. Frederic Henry in this 1932 adaptation of the Hemingway classic, Helen Hayes is the nurse Catherine Barkley who restores Henry to health, Jack La Rue is the priest who delivers a beautifully spare wedding celebration.  It isn't giving away anything to mention Catherine pays with her life after a nighttime swim; Cooper lifting her lithely as her arms dangle lifeless is the human interest story superimposed over the war effort.  The film wisely leaves it to the viewer to decide which tale was more costly.

Rogue Male
In almost every movie anthology there is one film that alone, justifies the cost of the package.  Rogue Male is the action gem of this set.  Peter O'Toole stars in this spy story as Thorndyke, repatriated to his native England after an attempt on the life of Adolph Hitler.  He finds his homeland duty just as dangerous as his tour abroad, and turns for refuge to his uncle, a British Earl played by Alastair Sim, but the uncle is too appeasement oriented to lend a hand.  Instead, help arrives in the form of money and shelter from friend Saul Abrahams, played with understated elegance by Nobel Prize winning playwright Harold Pinter. War time British citizens are surprisingly loose lipped and lead Hitler sympathizer Major Quive Smith (John Standing) to the lair of the spy where Thorndyke survives by virtue of wit and wile.  Cinematography and the semi faded color print actually enhance this story taking place in the war time British countryside.

Death Rage
Yul Brynner will look great or grotesque on HD in this spaghetti Western adapted to modern Naples, Italy.  Every pore and pocket mark on his face is visible in the naturalistic camera style chosen by director Anthony M. Dawson.  Easily the best soundtrack of any film in the package, by turns eerie and as befits Naples, everlasting. Brynner is a contract killer in search of the man who murdered his brother. Massimo Ranieri is a young and impressionable hit man wannabe attaching himself to Brynner upon his arrival in Naples.  He learns his deadly craft from the master while Martin Balsam as the crime Commissario tries to staunch the bleeding.  Contains poignant shots of the World Trade Center as Ranieri survives the carnage abroad and arrives to ply his gruesome trade in the New World.

Marie Galante
This 1934 half drama half romance came in a close second as the best film of the package.  It was perhaps shot as a feature for up-and-coming star Spencer Tracey, but Ketti Gallian, as the guileless cargo ship stowaway Marie Galante, impresses most with her evanescent innocence playing opposite Tracey's persistent suspicions about foreign intrigue hurting American interests in the Canal Zone.  Gallian's singing talents are on full display in several beguiling tunes, and it's almost a shame there has to be a plot and we can't simply carry on with the music and smoky cafes.  Gallian converts easily to a dramatic role when things get serious, and of course, Tracey is already there and very convincing as he doggedly tries to get at the source of anti-American activities.

Border Cop
This film is defined by its genre label ""action packed"".  It starts in a hurry with what has to be the best car chase ever for an opening sequence.  Frank Cooper (Telly Sevalas) is a short timer, 7 months shy of 20 years on Immigration Patrol and retirement eligible.  He still conveys meaning between his spoken lines, still slaps people on the cheek endearingly as he did in the TV serial Kojak.  Cooper is looking to skate - no incidents and no trouble, but winds up fighting corruption on both sides of the Mexican border - a criminal organization ferrying people north for substandard pay, an American apparatus headed by Moffat (Eddie Albert) pretending it sees nothing.  Danny de la Paz as Benny is driven to improve his living standard but his problems demand that Cooper intervene.  Excellent cinematography throughout.

Mark Of The Hawk
Sidney Portier as Obam (hawk) is too radical for the white governing party in his African homeland, too pacifist for his African brother Kanda.  Missionary Bruce Craig  (John McIntire) and intellectual Amugu (Juano Hernandez) occupy a middle ground, urging Christian principles of non-violence as the best path to freedom.  Their faith is put to the test when white separatists in the ruling class fortify a mansion and force Obam to take sides.  A solid script and effective flashbacks in the storytelling set the tone for the difficult transition to nationhood.

Thieves Of Fortune
Audiences are accustomed to seeing Lee Van Cleef as a beady eyed villain.  Few would have believed he could do camp comedy, but here it is, the eyes on view in a different role as Van Cleef plays a likeable and bawdy south of the border patrn who has amassed a fortune and left a will for distribution of his estate.  The language of the will contains a contest between two heir apparents designed to leave the wealth to the better man, and when one of contestants is actually a beautiful woman, all the components are in place for a gender bending farce featuring Baywatch's Shawn Weatherly as Peter, Craig Gardner as HH, her dim witted adversary, and Michael Nouri as the estate executor, Juan Luis.

Agency
This Robert Mitchum effort came with highest expectations and left with the most disappointments.  It simply has the look and feel of a made for TV production rather than a full blown exercise in modern cinema.  Mitchum imparts the detached authority of an advertising executive bent on creating messages that sell products and political candidates at the same time.  Lee Majors is restrained and cool as account exec Philip Morgan opposing Mitchum and his plans; and therein lies the problem.  Two sleek and cool customers working opposite ends of the emotional (and moral) spectrum.  Majors never rises to the level of outrage that we see from, say,  Peter Finch in Network.  Sure, we're glad in the end the police are not as dumb as they seem, but if the stars can't get excited, how can we?

Border Shootout
Glenn Ford developed a reputation for going against seemingly insurmountable odds (The Big Heat) and it follows him in this film but only for a  brief scene.  After his brawl with the U.S. cavalry, there is little else of interest that happens in this convoluted story about local justice and where the army buys its beef.  One would think Ford would be at the center of the tale but he's a marginal character away from the main story.  Instead there is a huge cast and in the end, we're not sure why.  The film has too many loose ends to be of interest.",1305763200,,14495,4.860342019543974
8062855,4,B0009KCTKU,"Given the fact that there are 20 movies in this box I won't be going into detail about every one of them, just my personal favorites both good and bad. Besides, there's a lot of crappy made for T.V films in the set that aren't worth watching.

'Agency'- Robert Mitchum plays a shady political adviser who's just taken over an ad agency. Two of his employees (Lee Majors and Saul Rubinek) suspect that he's splicing subliminal messages for his preferred candidate into their commercials. The two try to prove their theory but end up fighting for their lives after Mitchum gets wind of their snooping around. Mitchum is quite good in his small role but the film belongs to veteran character actor Rubinek ('True Romance'). His manic energy livens up the proceedings when things get too silly, which is often. For example, if you're trying to brainwash people into voting for your candidate would you really bury the message in an over-the-top deodorant commercial set in, of all places, Hell?

'Thieves Of Fortune'- With the exception of his 80s T.V series 'The Master', this is easily the most embarrassing thing Lee Van Cleef has ever appeared in. To add more insult to injury this was his last film. Luckily he's spared further humiliation by dying in the first 10 minutes (although his death is humiliating as well). The movie then becomes about an attractive woman who's forced to dress like a man and compete in death defying obstacles in order to inherit Van Cleef's fortune.

'Death Rage'- Yul Brynner plays a hitman coaxed out of retirement after learning that his latest assignment is the assassination of the man who killed his brother. Martin Balsam plays the detective who tries to stop him. The beautiful Barbara Bouchet plays Brynner's love interest. This film is the first of many in the box that are heavily edited which is a major disappointment. As a result this film, and plenty of the others, leave a majority of the ""action"" scenes on the cutting room floor.

'Rogue Male'- Peter O'Toole stars in this BBC film as a wealthy aristocrat who attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler. He is eventually hunted, captured and tortured by the Germans but manages to escape and hide out underground.

'A Farewell To Arms'- The first of two Hemingway adaptations in the box. Gary Cooper plays a soldier who falls in love with a nurse during the war. However, both the war and Cooper's best friend (a delightfully evil Adolphe Menjou) conspire to keep the lovers apart.

'The Snows Of Kilimanjaro'- Presented in beautiful Technicolor the film tells the story of a gravely wounded author (Gregory Peck) on an African safari with his wife (Susan Hayward). Given hours to live the man bitterly recounts his life's many failures both professionally and romantically. The luscious Ava Gardner plays one of Peck's former lovers.

'Gold'- This sounds like an awesome Roger Moore movie but, though advertised, you won't find it in this set. Instead you get another movie called 'Gold' made in the 30s. How do you like that?

'The Klansman'- A very interesting film for many reasons. The first being that it was originally going to be written and directed by the legendary Samuel Fuller who eventually walked off the project over creative differences. Star Lee Marvin, a Fuller regular, wanted to quit as well but couldn't get out of his contract. James Bond director Terence Young was eventually brought in to replace Fuller. After a white woman is raped, presumably by a black man (O.J. Simpson), the white townsfolk of this segregated Southern town want revenge. The KKK launches an all out race war and it's up to the town sheriff (Marvin) and pacifist (Richard Burton) to stop the violence and keep the peace. Unfortunately this film is the most heavily edited out of the whole box so the movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense since you never get to see the rape, the racial slurs and the violence that occurs. The brilliant Cameron Mitchell co-stars as Marvin's racist deputy.

'The Swap'- Hey look it's Robert DeNiro! This is one of the legend's early pictures and let's just say it's a little embarrassing. I'm not just talking about his mustache either. DeNiro plays a porno film editor who is murdered because one of his movies features a public figure who doesn't want it to get out. After DeNiro's  brother is released from prison he goes looking for revenge. DeNiro's role, shown mostly in flashbacks, is limited but it's more entertaining than later career choices such as 'Analyze That'.

'Beat The Devil'- This John Huston classic made Ebert's list of Great Movies despite being a huge flop when originally released. Written by Huston and Truman Capote the film stars Humphrey Bogart, Gina Lollobrigida, Jennifer Jones and Peter Lorre in a darkly comic, witty spoof of mystery films like 'The Maltese Falcon'. With reliably strong direction from Huston, acting from Bogart and  writing from Capote it's surprising this film flopped at the time. It's since developed a cult following. Bogart, whose production company released the film, lost a lot of money on it and regarded it as one of his biggest failures.

'They Made Me A Criminal'- Directed by Busby Berkely this film tells the story of a boxer (John Garfield) framed for murder who befriends a group of troublemakers (The Dead End Kids) living in the orphanage he hides out in. Claude Rains plays the detective hot on his trail.

Jimmy Cagney, Sidney Poitier and Mickey Rooney (A tough guy? Really?) turn in memorable turns in the otherwise mediocre movies collected here.

'Ripped Off'- In a bizarre case of life imitating art Robert Blake stars as an accused murderer desperately trying to prove his innocence to the cops (led by Ernest Borgnine). Just like in real life Blake acts all macho while maintaining his innocence but either way it's not convincing.

'Death Sentence'- An Aaron Spelling produced made for T.V. movie that features a very young Nick Nolte. Even though he gets top billing the film instead focuses on Cloris Leachman. A bummer for Nolte fans.

'Border Cop'- Telly Savalas is the titular hero who squares off against Michael V. Gazzo (the raspy voiced guy from 'Godfather 2') over the latter's habit of smuggling Mexican youths across the border to work in his slaughterhouses.

There are at least 6-7 great films that make this box worth checking out.  However, you do get gypped by heavily edited films and by 'Gold'. I think Brentwood fans who've already bought other 10 or 20 packs know this is to be expected.",1201392000,3,6510,4.86449864498645
8062856,4,B0009KCTKU,"TOUGH GUYS OF ACTION might be better described as ""Action Stars in Other Genres,"" for only half of these 20 titles are legitimate action movies.

The two based on Hemingway stories (""Farewell to Arms and ""Snows of Kilimanjaro"") are melodrama/romances. The Bogart film (""Beat the Devil"") fits just about every category BUT action. ""Death Sentence"" is a courtroom drama, ""They Made Me a Criminal"" a crime story. The DeNiro film's a drama, as are the Spencer Tracy and Sidney Poitier movies. Jack Palance appears in a horror/mystery story.

In spite of a technical misnomer, this DVD box set offers literally dozens of fine performers in mostly lesser-known films. The price for over 31 hours of entertainment is quite fair and BCI's audio and video transfers of these unrestored movies uniformly decent.
