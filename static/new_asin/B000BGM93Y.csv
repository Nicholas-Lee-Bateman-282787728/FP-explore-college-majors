8086472,5,B000BGM93Y,"The ""role of her life"" is a remarkable vision around two women; one of them is a famous actress whose emotional life is totally disintegrated, she is woman accustomed to command and being pleased, her capricious are endless but internally she has many holes, she is getting near 38 and still she has not any son, while the other is an extremely shy woman, but hyper talented, with a special gift for literature. Both will meet and the actress will hire to be her adviser and agent, but along the road an abyss of encountered opinions and radically different points of view will make they follow by different roads.

The script reminds me to Erich Rohmer's  moral tales. As a matter of fact, the unsaid language of admiration and reprobation; will intermingle; passion, frivolity and disloyalty are mixed in this powerful dramatis personae.

The rhythm is slow, not easy to follow, but once you take the tempo, you will be absolutely rewarded.",1180396800,7,942,4.802469135802469
