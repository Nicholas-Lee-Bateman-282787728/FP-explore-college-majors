8541089,5,B009G4OONU,"I lost this DVD in a move and I'm glad I was able to buy it back. It's basically a series of short movies featuring BMW cars, but the films are directed by famous directors such as John Frankenheimer (Grand Prix, Ronin), Joe Carnahan (Narcs) and Tony Scott (Top Gun). It's a pleasure to see a young Clive Owen drive wonderful machines. Recommended to car fans.",1529020800,,360,4.46969696969697

8541091,5,B009G4OONU,"The through line is the Driver.  Clive Owen makes a statement by being an enigma.  He drive various BMWs, and it appears to be his job.  Beyond that we know nothing of him; somehow that's as unimportant as the cars themselves.  Great mini moves, from great directors.",1481760000,,267,4.617021276595745
