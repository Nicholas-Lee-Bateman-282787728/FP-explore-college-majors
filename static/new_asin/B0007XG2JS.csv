8053336,3,B0007XG2JS,"This DVD is a collection of the Three Stooges cartoons from several decades ago. The last three stooges actually voiced the animated stooges.  The cartoons are really short and left me wanting more of each storyline. I liked these toons. They are typical slapstick Stooges.
They are goofy and just fun to watch. They only problems I had with these toons were that they were too short and the color was faded/",1426809600,,408,4.666666666666667
8053337,3,B0007XG2JS,"The dvd arrived in good condition, and it did include the bubble gum. The picture is snowy and not in the best picture quality. The sound is okay. It looks like it was taped directly off of cable tv years ago. It was boring to me, even though I love the three stooges movies. This cartoon is poor picture quality.",1369699200,,313,4.233333333333333
