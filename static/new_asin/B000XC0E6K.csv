3000621,2,B000XC0E6K,"I have 3 female cats: one is 17 and the other 2 are sisters, about 8 months old. I bought the video hoping to give the two little kitties something to do while I was gone during the day. I put the TV down on the floor, not far from their food and water. I played the video, and watched from a distance to see their reaction. Total indifference! They paid absolutely no attention to it whatsoever. I have tried turning up the sound, playing each segment continuously--nothing works. My cats are far more interested in sitting on the window seat and watching the street, which has no squirrels or bugs or birds.  Go figure.",1207440000,5,621,4.4
3000622,2,B000XC0E6K,"This dvd has realistic sounds to match the images. The animals vary and the scenes are always changing to provide variety. When I first placed the dvd in, my cat was seated and ready but she lost interest nearly straight away. I thought it was just the opening so I fast forwarded to the other animals. The ducks kept her interest for a short while. The dvd doesn't allow you to skip or chose the animals your cat may prefer. My cat loves 'The Purrfect Cat DVD'.",1200873600,6,462,4.32183908045977
3000623,5,B000XC0E6K,Bought this DVD for my cat for her birthday and she loves it.  I own a number of other cat DVDs but this one tops them all.  The music is much better and the sound FX go along with whats on the screen (unlike others).  Her favorite part is the butterflies section.,1200787200,14,264,4.038461538461538
3000624,5,B000XC0E6K,"My cat loves this DVD,he watches the TV and gets excited especially with the birds and their chatter.
The background music is great for the owner as well.
If you love your kitty and you don't want him to be lonely while you are out, then get this for them. You won't regret it.",1200614400,24,277,4.148148148148148
3000625,4,B000XC0E6K,"My cats liked the birds in the video, but could have had more action.  They weren't at all interested in the walk through the woods.  Too much time spent on the fuzzy thing on the string.  I would have included more action, like mother bird feeding babies, squirrels eating nuts or playing, maybe dogs rounding up cattle... just more creativeness.  Maybe this would be good for older cats. Nice music and serene.",1200096000,8,412,4.680555555555555
3000626,5,B000XC0E6K,"My 1 year-old cat, Bob, got this DVD for Christmas and he absolutely loves it! As soon as he started hearing the nature noises he came over, sat in front of the TV and soon was pawing at the screen, trying to catch the butterflies. At one point I found him sitting on top of the tv, trying to catch one of the dangling strings!
I would highly recommend this DVD to cat owners. As I said, my Bob loves it - as a matter of fact, now he comes running every time he hears me turn on the tv, thinking we're going to watch his dvd!",1199836800,69,525,3.9158878504672896
3000627,3,B000XC0E6K,"It seems I enjoyed the dvd better than my cats. They were not very interested, they lost interest very fast and started playing with their furry mice",1199664000,25,149,4.555555555555555
3000628,1,B000XC0E6K,"I bought this DVD for my cat based upon the 3 5-star reviews that were available at the time I placed my order. Based upon those avaiable reviews, I thought this would be the best DVD to buy. My husband and I have concluded that perhaps this DVD is meant for cats that are more independent and possibly left alone more often than our cat. Our cat is very active and plays with us for hours every day. She is rarely left alone. She was totally bored with this DVD. In fact, I could not get her to even look at the animals. She would rather watch the live hummingbirds feeding outside our living room window and chase spiders around the house. She did notice the red ribbon but bored of that in about 5 seconds.",1199491200,12,709,4.220588235294118
3000629,5,B000XC0E6K,"My cat Stacy loves this DVD.  Always runs over to the TV when I load it into the DVD Player.  My small kitty Shasta, (15 weeks) doesnt seem to interested at the moment but still is a bit young.  Would recommend to anyone with a bored cat.",1192838400,,238,4.0212765957446805

My cat LOVES this DVD!! When I get up in the morning he RUNS to the T.V./ DVD player wanting me to get it going! I've tried to teach him to get it going himself since the DVD player is on the bottom of the T.V. stand close to the floor. He has learned to use his nose to push the ""ON"" button to turn it on. I have a 42"" flat screen so the T.V. stand is long and he gets up on it to try to get IN the picture. When the camera goes down a grassy path he looks behind the T.V. to see if he can walk in the grass to,  I THINK! LOL  So needless to say YES HE LOVES IT! Oh yes and it starts over again on it's own when gets to the end! I definitely recommend this DVD!",1508457600,13,891,4.460122699386503

3000635,3,B000XC0E6K,"Pretty disappointed, only because the third scene features a cat and kitten playing, and loudly meowing, this renders the video.useless for my intended purpose of continued play when I am away.

3000678,5,B000XC0E6K,"First off...my cats love this DVD, but you may have to keep trying with it.  I think it depends entirely on the cat as to how much attention they pay to this video.  We have three cats.  One who adopted us about 3 months ago.  We tried putting him in the garage at night and letting him outside in the morning, but alas he stole our hearts and as of today, after vet visit for shots and tests he is ours and currently spending his first week in the bedroom with door closed.  Doing it all by the book.  So...the DVD.  Our Singapura Rudy loves it, but in the beginning he walked away from it.  His brother Leo really liked it and so we continued to play it.  Eventually Rudy started watching.  They alternate now and get right up on the TV screen.  I keep telling them sitting that close to the screen will hurt their eyes, but they don't listen.  Our new family member is Duke.  He is approximately  2 years old, per his doctor.  We live in a wooded area and one day about 3-4 months ago he just showed up.  One ear was clipped, which meant he had been fixed.  He is a tabby, but does not act feral.  We are following his doctors instructions and he will stay in the bedroom for a week to begin to acclimate him into the house.  I didn't know if he would care about the DVD since he was an outside cat and already exposed to all the birds, butterflies, mice, etc.  He was fascinated!!  He stared and stared.  He began looking behind the TV to see where the birds went (smart guy).  SO...even if they walk away keep trying, your baby may surprise you and start liking it.",1444694400,,1570,4.177257525083612

It will heighten your cat's senses and entertain too! The music is soothing and it will definitely keep your cat company. Our cat loves it so much, that she'll jump up on the stool we have placed in front of the t.v. screen, as if to say, can we watch the video again? When she does, she is delighted and even try's to touch the butterfly's on the screen. Sometimes when the birds fly out the front window, she looks at the t.v. to be sure where they are coming from, especially when she hears odd noises.
We just love this item and recommend it to everyone with a cat or many cats. Enjoy!",1402617600,2,741,4.26241134751773
3000692,1,B000XC0E6K,I purchased this as a follow up to another cat DVD that my paw girls initially liked but became bored with. This did not even get their attention for one watching.  Too much like a walk through the woods trail with no movement to catch their eye.  Where there was 'action' it was not attention grabbing.,1398643200,,303,4.392857142857143

3000697,2,B000XC0E6K,I watched this video with the person who received it as a gift - we are both cat lovers and it really lacks action that cats find interesting.  Video quality is not the best and subject matter is BORING.  The cats couldn't be bothered.,1389571200,,235,4.318181818181818
3000698,5,B000XC0E6K,"My kitten is absolutely the most mischievous I've ever had.  When she's idle, she gets into trouble, so we tried White You Are Gone.  She was mesmerized for about an hour even fell asleep watching it.  When we first turned it on, her ears perked and she was desperately trying to figure out where the images were coming from...  She looked behind and around the Screen until she finally realized where the images were!  My older cat is about 13 years old and could have cared less, so perhaps it's for the young at heart always looking for a challenge.  Glad I bought it and would recommend it particularly for the active kittens and young adults!",1389484800,4,647,4.5344827586206895

3000708,5,B000XC0E6K,"The only problem- my cat almost broke the television.  He was captivated.  Put it on an older, heavier television with the fat back so it won't tip over if the cat jumps at it.

I have two Bengals cats that are one-year old and they love the Discovery Channel, often running around the back of the flat screen to see where the hawks or the birds went.  So naturally, I thought they would love this DVD.  I put it on and they simply walked out of the room.  They literally LEFT the THEATER!  This DVD is simply one person with a handheld video camera walking around the woods with birds chirping in the background between scenes.  The specific scenes are of bright birds in the branches of trees chirping for ten to fifteen minutes and then another stroll through the woods until the next scene.  These include an old lazy cat being tossed a little red string (the cat was bored), ducks floating in a pond, scenes of a fish tank with tropical fish floating around, more lazy cat on the porch scenes - all with simple piano ""Charlie Brown"" type music in the background or some slightly ethereal music for enhancement.  The music was distracting.  There was even a scene where a fluffy ball on the end of a stick was bouncing around the screen to attract the cats.  It was utter nonsense.  The best I can say is that it does loop after one hour to begin all over again.

Silence and real animal noises are what cats want.  I would like to see a professional DVD with wild animal noises and vivid bird and animal scenes that a cat would go crazy for.  My cats would love to see an African lion go after a zebra!  This video is amateurish and lacking any attraction - for my cats anyway.  I dislike one-star or negative reviews, but if it saves you some money, then it's worth it.  Buy a Discovery Channel DVD!",1304380800,64,1659,4.334415584415584

There is lousy sound (mic noise), sound doesn't match what's on the screen (our cat kept looking away, trying to see where the interesting stuff was), and a whole lot of time is spent either walking around (jerky camera work), or watching ducks in the water.
Ducks. In water. My cat was not amused.
Background noise included kids yelling (freaked the cat a bit), and occasional voice overs of people talking about their pets - including dog owners talking about their dogs. Um, isn't this a cat video? Yeah, that's what I thought.

This is one of 2 DVDs that I bought in hopes of giving her a little stimulation. For you comparisons shoppers out there, I'll review ""The Purrfect DVD"" after we watch it.

She showed little interest while watching on the TV across the room, so I plugged an external DVD drive into a netbook and set it on the floor next to her cage. The opening footage, which shows a butterfly on a flower, had her glued to the set.

She found the songbird so entertaining that she reached through the bars of her cage and swatted at the screen. Same for the chickens. She likes the fish, but not as much as the birds.

She wasn't at all interested in the ribbon, the white pompom on the end of a wire, or the cats. The loud meowing didn't seem to fit with the views of cats lying on a chair and batting at the ribbon. She would have probably preferred to watch them tearing a mouse apart.

I thought the footage of the path through the grass would bore her, but she watched it. Maybe it reminded her of our daily walks through our backyard and the adjacent woods.

My cat doesn't react to the music, but I found it pleasant for doing yoga while my cat watches the video.

The human voices sound like they're talking from beyond the grave. Kitty doesn't seem to mind, but I find them creepy.

Also, whoever created this DVD obviously didn't put much time or care into making it. The whole thing seems very amateur. Too much camera movement, and the last 20 minutes or so is just a shot of an aquarium, which is just lazy on the editor's part. My cat gets bored after watching the same boring fish for 5 minutes.

That said, my cat loves the birds and butterflies. Unfortunately I'm constantly fast forwarding to these few good moments.

The music is beautiful and the nature scenes are very soothing.

It's now been four weeks, and the cats ask, every day, for this to be on.  Now if you get this expecting your cats to be glued to the set 24/7, you're going to be disappointed.  If you want something that just generally makes a more pleasant time for the kitties, and gives them something other then the wall to stare at when bored; this is what you want.

The cats come and go as they please, but they honestly spend more time watching this then in other places, when they're not being played with.  And play?  This is where it excels.. since we got this.. Mara, who was a runt and generally hates touching and play... has joined in chase the string games and barely hisses at Atton anymore.

My other cat, though, is easily bored and a little too smart for her own good, and while she enjoyed watching it as she was drifting off to sleep last night, when she's fully awake she couldn't care less. She is more interested in watching the other cat watch the DVD! I thought she would like it better, since she loves watching clips of mice on YouTube and has sat down and watched cartoons before, but I guess there's not enough action for her.

This DVD was like I was turning the tv to her favorite channel. I put this on my computer for her to watch, and aside from her stepping on the keys with excitement, I do think it was a good idea to play it on the computer. It was fun for her to watch it on this because she could get close to the screen and try to touch the animals & birds. She was entranced by the butterflies in the beginning, batting at the screen and putting her face up to it. There is a segment with a string dangling that she actually tried to play with too. She'd change positions on the bed, and so when I turned the computer or moved it for her, she continued to watch & play with it. That is another nice aspect about putting it on the computer. She even watched it when I had to put it on mute for a phone call.  The DVD  switches between segments often enough that she doesn't get bored with it. The objects vary between butterflies, birds, ducks, cats, and strings, etc. I was worried before when I would see Coco laying with her eyes open, looking bored.

My cat is extremely active and involved in our lives (I'm always home with it now) and I was heartbroken about leaving him home for five days.  I just got the dvd today and thought I would try it before my vacation. At first, he didn't care, but when I plopped him in front of the tv set he was hooked.  Unbelievable.  It's like the video ""talks"" to cats.  He has now been successfully watching the video for the last half hour.  He love it, I can tell.  He even tried to get the birds with his paw and walked around the back of the television to try to figure out if birds were trapped inside.  This is great!

I played the video, and watched from a distance to see their reaction. Total indifference! They paid absolutely no attention to it whatsoever.

Based upon those avaiable reviews, I thought this would be the best DVD to buy. My husband and I have concluded that perhaps this DVD is meant for cats that are more independent and possibly left alone more often than our cat. Our cat is very active and plays with us for hours every day. She is rarely left alone. She was totally bored with this DVD. In fact, I could not get her to even look at the animals. She would rather watch the live hummingbirds feeding outside our living room window and chase spiders around the house.

3235175,5,B000XC0E6K,"First off...my cats love this DVD, but you may have to keep trying with it.  I think it depends entirely on the cat as to how much attention they pay to this video.  We have three cats.  One who adopted us about 3 months ago.  We tried putting him in the garage at night and letting him outside in the morning, but alas he stole our hearts and as of today, after vet visit for shots and tests he is ours and currently spending his first week in the bedroom with door closed.  Doing it all by the book.  So...the DVD.  Our Singapura Rudy loves it, but in the beginning he walked away from it.  His brother Leo really liked it and so we continued to play it.  Eventually Rudy started watching.  They alternate now and get right up on the TV screen.  I keep telling them sitting that close to the screen will hurt their eyes, but they don't listen.  Our new family member is Duke.  He is approximately  2 years old, per his doctor.  We live in a wooded area and one day about 3-4 months ago he just showed up.  One ear was clipped, which meant he had been fixed.  He is a tabby, but does not act feral.  We are following his doctors instructions and he will stay in the bedroom for a week to begin to acclimate him into the house.  I didn't know if he would care about the DVD since he was an outside cat and already exposed to all the birds, butterflies, mice, etc.  He was fascinated!!  He stared and stared.  He began looking behind the TV to see where the birds went (smart guy).  SO...even if they walk away keep trying, your baby may surprise you and start liking it.",1444694400,,1570,4.177257525083612

I have two Bengals cats that are one-year old and they love the Discovery Channel, often running around the back of the flat screen to see where the hawks or the birds went.  So naturally, I thought they would love this DVD.  I put it on and they simply walked out of the room.  They literally LEFT the THEATER!  This DVD is simply one person with a handheld video camera walking around the woods with birds chirping in the background between scenes.  The specific scenes are of bright birds in the branches of trees chirping for ten to fifteen minutes and then another stroll through the woods until the next scene.  These include an old lazy cat being tossed a little red string (the cat was bored), ducks floating in a pond, scenes of a fish tank with tropical fish floating around, more lazy cat on the porch scenes - all with simple piano ""Charlie Brown"" type music in the background or some slightly ethereal music for enhancement.  The music was distracting.  There was even a scene where a fluffy ball on the end of a stick was bouncing around the screen to attract the cats.  It was utter nonsense.  The best I can say is that it does loop after one hour to begin all over again.

Silence and real animal noises are what cats want.  I would like to see a professional DVD with wild animal noises and vivid bird and animal scenes that a cat would go crazy for.  My cats would love to see an African lion go after a zebra!  This video is amateurish and lacking any attraction - for my cats anyway.  I dislike one-star or negative reviews, but if it saves you some money, then it's worth it.  Buy a Discovery Channel DVD!",1304380800,64,1659,4.334415584415584

There is lousy sound (mic noise), sound doesn't match what's on the screen (our cat kept looking away, trying to see where the interesting stuff was), and a whole lot of time is spent either walking around (jerky camera work), or watching ducks in the water.
Ducks. In water. My cat was not amused.
Background noise included kids yelling (freaked the cat a bit), and occasional voice overs of people talking about their pets - including dog owners talking about their dogs. Um, isn't this a cat video? Yeah, that's what I thought.
After the chicken segment, our cat just laid down, and looked away.",1292544000,7,779,4.492957746478873

This is one of 2 DVDs that I bought in hopes of giving her a little stimulation. For you comparisons shoppers out there, I'll review ""The Purrfect DVD"" after we watch it.

She showed little interest while watching on the TV across the room, so I plugged an external DVD drive into a netbook and set it on the floor next to her cage. The opening footage, which shows a butterfly on a flower, had her glued to the set.

She found the songbird so entertaining that she reached through the bars of her cage and swatted at the screen. Same for the chickens. She likes the fish, but not as much as the birds.

She wasn't at all interested in the ribbon, the white pompom on the end of a wire, or the cats. The loud meowing didn't seem to fit with the views of cats lying on a chair and batting at the ribbon. She would have probably preferred to watch them tearing a mouse apart.

I thought the footage of the path through the grass would bore her, but she watched it. Maybe it reminded her of our daily walks through our backyard and the adjacent woods.

My cat doesn't react to the music, but I found it pleasant for doing yoga while my cat watches the video.

The human voices sound like they're talking from beyond the grave. Kitty doesn't seem to mind, but I find them creepy.

Also, whoever created this DVD obviously didn't put much time or care into making it. The whole thing seems very amateur. Too much camera movement, and the last 20 minutes or so is just a shot of an aquarium, which is just lazy on the editor's part. My cat gets bored after watching the same boring fish for 5 minutes.

That said, my cat loves the birds and butterflies. Unfortunately I'm constantly fast forwarding to these few good moments.

The music is beautiful and the nature scenes are very soothing.

It's now been four weeks, and the cats ask, every day, for this to be on.  Now if you get this expecting your cats to be glued to the set 24/7, you're going to be disappointed.

This is where it excels.. since we got this.. Mara, who was a runt and generally hates touching and play... has joined in chase the string games and barely hisses at Atton anymore.

She is more interested in watching the other cat watch the DVD! I thought she would like it better, since she loves watching clips of mice on YouTube and has sat down and watched cartoons before, but I guess there's not enough action for her.

If you have cats who love ducks and butterflies, they will probably be entertained by this DVD. Like people, the interest level seems to depend on the cat's personality and interests.",1261958400,3,1129,4.392344497607655
3235313,5,B000XC0E6K,"I've never had a cat that likes television, but it became clear that I'm not the only one in this house who loves Animal Planet!  I'd heard about DVDs for pets and decided to try this one, based on the reviews, and it's been a hit with Spunk from the beginning.  He loves the ducks, but the chickens got him up and standing on his hind legs with his paws on the screen--a real tribute from a cat who lives at the edge of a forest and gets to play outside all day!  I don't know if this would make your cat a viewer, but if you know you already have a cat that's interested in tv, I can almost guarantee you'll both love this video.
p.s.  I'm a school librarian and, while I'd love to see Spunk reading instead, that doesn't seem likely, so I'm calling this an educational video!",1259280000,8,778,4.132450331125828
3235314,5,B000XC0E6K,I have a 6yr old tabby and a 7month old Balinese and both of them are fascinated by this. My 6yr old (commonly known for being super lazy) acts like the 7th month old when I put this on for them. Attemtping to climb onto the entertainment system and swatting at the flamingos on the screen. The chasing shadows scene makes them go nutts. I think I'm more entertained by their reactions than they are by the tv. This is a must get for anyone with a cat that could use something new.,1256688000,,481,4.182795698924731
3235315,3,B000XC0E6K,"The dvd served its purpose;however, I'm confused as to why there is writing coming across the screen. As though my cat can read it? And the weird man voice that tells a story, is a little creepy when you're not expecting a random man to start talking. Other than that, it held their interests.",1255305600,,293,4.444444444444445
3235336,5,B000XC0E6K,"My 7 year old siamese cat, Coco, LOVES this dvd. She'll typically play with any toy that is given to her, and so I thought it would be fun to see what she thought of this. Often, I notice that she'll watch my tv shows with me- not the entire thing of course, but she watches the tv more than any other cat I've had. This DVD was like I was turning the tv to her favorite channel. I put this on my computer for her to watch, and aside from her stepping on the keys with excitement, I do think it was a good idea to play it on the computer. It was fun for her to watch it on this because she could get close to the screen and try to touch the animals & birds. She was entranced by the butterflies in the beginning, batting at the screen and putting her face up to it. There is a segment with a string dangling that she actually tried to play with too. She'd change positions on the bed, and so when I turned the computer or moved it for her, she continued to watch & play with it. That is another nice aspect about putting it on the computer. She even watched it when I had to put it on mute for a phone call.  The DVD  switches between segments often enough that she doesn't get bored with it. The objects vary between butterflies, birds, ducks, cats, and strings, etc. I was worried before when I would see Coco laying with her eyes open, looking bored. DVDS like this one, I think, are going to be a great fix for that, so she'll have something else to entertain her in my tiny Chicago apartment. =) I highly recommend this DVD, and Coco does too!! =)",1246924800,2,1552,4.052117263843648

I always leave my television on while I am gone, but we don't have the same tastes in programs. This has been a wonderful distraction for him. He's not as moody now since he has this dvd to watch and listen to. Sometimes I play it for myself if I get tired of listening to regular tv.

Have tried a couple times - listens to the meows for a few seconds - seems to have learned they are not real - and walks out of the room.  Of course all cats are different.,1233100800,,275,3.875
3235343,3,B000XC0E6K,My Precious loves this DVD and I would recommend it.  It has some good nature sounds and stimulating video that my cat loves.

I also wish that it was a little longer b/c you have to put it on repeat and then my cat gets a little bored after about 7 hours while I'm away at work.,1232236800,,385,3.9740259740259742

3235345,5,B000XC0E6K,"Hi Everyone-  I've never really done an online review before, but I thought this required it.  My cat is extremely active and involved in our lives (I'm always home with it now) and I was heartbroken about leaving him home for five days.  I just got the dvd today and thought I would try it before my vacation. At first, he didn't care, but when I plopped him in front of the tv set he was hooked.  Unbelievable.  It's like the video ""talks"" to cats.  He has now been successfully watching the video for the last half hour.  He love it, I can tell.  He even tried to get the birds with his paw and walked around the back of the television to try to figure out if birds were trapped inside.  This is great!
