It's a wild mash up of Upton Sinclair style social commentary, GI Joe, Sons of Anarchy, Mad Max, Maurice G Dantec, Cinemax-Skinemax, and old fashion Olivier Marchal cop on cop violence. It doesn't always gel well together but it's excellent in that unhinged wild man sense.

The basic plot is that in a strange, vaguely Mad Max future the cops are being privatized by a corporation but the government knows that they are involved in insurgency and organized crime. They have setup Section Zero made of elite GI Joe types to take them down. I say GI Joe because these guys are pretty cartoon-ish. Lead actor Ola Rapace sorta looks the part but the rest of them look like grizzled bar patrons you drug out of a dive bar in Marseilles. Oh and one super cute actress who is so determined to be an actress that she let them film her in bad lighting with bad make up. Her looks defeat it and still manages to look extra cute no matter how hard a grimace she can muster up. Her looks can't defeat her part as a religious studies martial arts master that weighs 100 pounds and is 5 feet of cute. It's all fantasy is what I'm saying. It's old men and young women and they all shoot things mercilessly until they're extra dead when they aren't having lots of sex.

It's all a bit at odds with the Upton Sinclair social commentary. Rapidly expanding corporations, wealth gap, immigration, police corruption, etc. are all touched on. It's like a weird attempt at maybe justifying all the violence and sex on display but it doesn't work. It does however give them stuff to spin off into plot wise. So, you never get completely angry at the shrillness of it cause it just leads to more entertaining moments on screen.

It's all played straight too. I teased about the cute actress above. Her name is Maud Jurez. She besides being crazy cute gives it her best. Sometimes, an actress gets Alain Delon syndrome where your looks are just to big a mountain to climb. Catherine Marchal puts in a good performance too. In fact, pretty much all the actresses here make the story work. They don't wink at the camera letting you know they think they're in something silly or stupid. They basically let the guys have their fun as they should. It'd be wrong to show up in a Jane Austen or Notebook adaptation winking at the camera that you know it's gender wish fulfillment.

You'll know pretty quick if the show is for you. I enjoy the wild little boy fantasy of it all. It's also pretty well made. So, you never feel like you're watching anything less than the best little boy fantasy. Good for guys wanting something made for them and girls who might get a chuckle or 2 off how silly guys can be.

I got my copy through Prestivo. They sent it in excellent packaging and I received it quickly. Great responsive service too when there was a problem with the mailing system.",1508284800,,2921,4.442164179104478
