1045906,4,6305561397,"After being very pleased with the first two installments of this series, I have waited anxiously for this most resent tape and it maintains the high quality of the previous episodes and then some.  The first episode is  refreshing in that it is a complete story involving real people and not  just a mad boomer getting blown to bits.  The second episode begins to get  away from the previous obsession the series has had with Linna and begins  to look more at Priss.  We get a chance to see into her head and begin to  dig up hints about her past.  Prior to this, our only hints to Priss' past  (at least in video) have been some brief flashbacks in the Hurricaine  videos.
My big complaint, why only two episodes?  The first two tapes had  three episodes apiece, yet I'm paying just as much for this one.",949104000,3,805,4.394557823129252
1045907,4,6305561397,"I remember when BGC first came out waaaaay back when.  And then the appearence of the sequel set of OVA's for CRASH.  I loved the hardsuit designs, but hated it when they changed them for Crash.  I am glad that  they are mostly back for the remake.  Althought the decomposing energy core  is a neat trick, if not a ""power ranger"" type plot device.
The  music is different from the first, but not bad.
The way the story has  been re-written is interesting... I hope they don't get trite... but the  hints at Celia being something ""other"" than what she seems was  always hinted at in the original, but never confirmed.  Not sure if I like  the change on her from power-suit Melrose brunette to Madonna flowing  hair... but hey... no one asked me!
I'd say get it.. it's interesting,  well done (subtitled anyways) and it will keep you wanting the next Volume.  About as addictive as Evangelion!",949017600,,891,4.550632911392405
1045908,5,6305561397,"The characters seem to be developing far beyond the ""cute mercenary girls in armor"" that the original BGC series portrayed them as.  The dub job isn't as good as some, but better than most, with a few notable  exceptions.  Priss' voice NEVER matches her lips when she's singing, but  that's the hardest part.  I only wish they hadn't chopped it up in half  hour segments....  And made me wait two months for the next tape!",944956800,2,422,4.546666666666667

7891279,3,6305561397,"I remember when I rented the series in the late 1980's and how impressed I was with the storyline about corrupt, nefarious corporate interests bent on subjugating the world through advanced biomechanical constructs. Having beautiful girls in technologically superior hard-suits fighting against this behemoth only added to the depth of the plot.

  The animation was really ahead of its time even by todays standard. I thought the details given to each character gave the series a unmistakable quality of uniqueness often overlooked in the current iteration. Nene, Lena, and Sylia seem a bit cookie-cutter bland.

  The emphasis on the environment and scenery with a obtruse pointless fog on the technology involved took away most of what could have been a worthy successor.

  If you want a idea of what the corrent series is about, go ahead and spend the $5 for the 3 episode package. You won't be disappointed. Better than spending $20+.",1127606400,,940,5.091503267973856
7891280,5,6305561397,"In this Installment of BGC 2040, Galatea has transformed....into something that isn't describeable even if I described it to you.
Mackie has been fully infected with the Boomer Virus, and this puts Sylia out of commission as she deals with the Pain of not protecting her ward.
Meanwhile, the remaining 3 Knight Sabers cook up a very weird plan to stop Galatea...one that involves a spaceship, the Motoslave, and an unexpected surprise that will mess up the plans.
Oh yeah, Priss sings a song that I wish was released onto a single in it's full glory!
Pick this one up if you want to see some weird stuff to go on. A true episode for BGC fans.",980812800,,642,4.495726495726496
7891281,5,6305561397,"Bubblegum Crisis: T.  Also called Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040: Volume 2.  Yes, this is volume 2.
The three episodes on this tape are done on the same level as the preceding three... astounding.  Although Priss's lips really do not line up with her voice, it doesn't matter- it takes nothing away from the enjoyment of the series.
In this volume, the Knights' hardsuits get damaged and will be down for a week, Slyia's brother drops in for a visit, and Priss's eyes get even more unforgivingly beautiful (gosh, those eyes!!). =^_^=
try it, you'll like it!  ^_^",976406400,,559,4.731958762886598
7891282,4,6305561397,"A great introduction tape that sets the stage for things to come. The animation is top quality and has a very nice feel to it. This tape is a must even for those who don't wish to see the whole story because it gives  a good look at the changes between this version and the old BGC. Though the  tape is not that fulfilling in and of its self, because so much is still  unsaid, it is a perfect launch to the rest of the tapes.",962582400,,425,3.9186046511627906

7891284,3,6305561397,"As a serious fan of the original series I wasn't expecting much from Tokyo 2040, but I was surprised. In technical terms Tokyo 2040 is far superior to the 'old' BGC but considering that its been over a decade this isn't too  surprising. However there are a few nasty computer generated effects that  look out of place and in places the animation suffers from flat colours and  poor motion effects. But these are minor quibbles.
The characters are  interesting and fit well with the new series, however with my mind filled  with images of how they used to be I had problems adjusting. I just don't  like the new 1990's styling on Linna, Sylia, Nene, Daley and Mackie. Leon  and Priss look much the same as they always did - scruffy bikers!
The  characterisation of the 'new' characters is also odd. In particular Sylia  is poorly done - perhaps the writers were attempting to protray someone who  is actually insane (or at least has serious personality defects) but they  failed. Sylia comes across as a paraody and her obvious mental and  emotional problems are not skillfully handled. Although, this said, the  writing with regard to Linna and Nene is much improved (they get airtime!)  Furthermore fans of the old series will note that Tokyo 2040 is less the  Priss Asagiri show and more Bubblegum Crisis. Much fun can also be had  spotting various cartoon in-jokes (Duff cola anyone?.) However I'm not keen  on remakes, perhaps AIC should have bothered thinking up something new...  All in all I have to conculde that whilst this is not my favorite anime  series, it wasn't that bad and will be retained in my collection, at the  back of a cupboard...",949536000,2,1654,4.716783216783217
