Absolutely amazing documentary about life aboard The Fighting Lady aircraft carrier during WWII. Excellent audio and visual quality leaves you mesmerized. Fantastic footage of air battles and an insight into a sailors life aboard a ship whose elevators are as large as tennis courts, whose arsenal is large enough to blow us all to kingdom come, whose ships officers are referred to as Glamour boys, and whose returning planes come in at 130 mph to land on deck after their bombing missions are completed. But, thats only the beginning, who was The Fighting  Lady?

Because of wartime restrictions, the name of the aircraft carrier was disguised as ""the Fighting Lady""; afterwards the ship's true name became public  she was the U.S.S. Yorktown.
Frequently mentioned is the adage that war is 99% waiting. Following an attack on Kwajalein in early 1944, intelligence reports that an armada of Japanese ships is massing near Truk, a major Japanese logistical base in the Carolines. The Fighting Lady and some of her task force are sent on a ""hit and run"" mission to neutralize it and return to Marcus, but not to attempt a landing.
Once the ship returns from the massive, two-day Truk raid, it is then sent to the waters off the Marianas and participates in the famous ""Marianas Turkey Shoot"".
Other battles are engaged and The Fighting Lady is always victorious. In all, she destroyed 767 Japanese aircraft.
This beautifully done documentary involves us personally on life aboard an aircraft carrier, and you get to know some of the crew members. Sadly, however, the servicemen who appeared in the film are reintroduced to us, and we are informed, that they had died in battle. It is an emotional ending to a program, which is engaging, enlightening and absolutely magnificent as a tribute to the brave men who served us well during the war to end all wars.

I would absolutely recommend this program for the educational, magnificently filmed aerial footage and for giving us a personal insight into the lives of those men who worked so tirelessly to defend our country in its time of need. This program is a stunning tribute to those men in uniform who served us so well.",1418083200,,2205,4.838196286472148
