7823273,5,6302217482,"I grew up with this video, My mother bought it for me when I was a toddler and I fell in love with this video. I would watch this and sing along and dance all the time. I think that for me, the fact it's been pretty much 20 years since this video came out and there are adults who watched this as children coming together as a family to watch with their children, and adults my age still remembering this video all these years later and having fond memories is a test to the quality and heart put into this video. This isn't a really well written review as I haven't seen this video in about 10 years but I have fond memories of this video and if you want a sing a long song VHS that has unique songs, and wonderful warmth and soul that will make you get up and dance and put a smile of you or your child's face then please get this video. You will enjoy it.",1330041600,3,858,3.9653179190751446

7823275,5,6302217482,"What you're seeing here is a live Walt Disney World concert hosted by Samuel Wright (the voice of Sebastian the crab from The Little Mermaid). Featuring a clip of Under The Sea from The Little Mermaid, this video features various calypso style songs. It teaches you to dance too. Samuel Wright is fantastic- he even gets to talk to his alter-ego - Sebastian. The kid dancers that backup Samuel Wright are also a major highlight- they're all brilliant and can really inspire you to be an entertainer. By the way, I think the best kid dancer was the older girl in pink.

I'm sure you'll have your favorite kid dancers and songs too. I say get this video to find out.",1123718400,,664,4.487603305785124
7823276,5,6302217482,"My almost two-year-old son loves this video.  We watch it every evening and he sings and dances and even kisses them goodbye.  The music is fun and familiar, and Sam Wright and his gang are lively and entertaining. If you can find it, make a copy to use later when it wears out.  I assure you, it will.",1000684800,6,302,4.172413793103448
7823277,5,6302217482,"As a caribbean parent, it is hard to find good children videos that would showcase the caribbean culture.  One thing I regret to see is the fact that there were not enough black children in the video.  My family and friends  enjoy this video very much, but I can't find it anywhere.  In the meantime,  I will keek renting it at the video store.  Great Job!",949449600,4,356,4.318181818181818
