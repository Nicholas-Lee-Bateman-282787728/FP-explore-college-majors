8270099,1,B0018LQ964,"What do you get when you gather together a group of rock musicians - several from the band Spindrift - have them write, direct and star in a spoof of spaghetti westerns, then scratch the film stock and soundtrack so the whole thing looks and sounds like a newly re-discovered B-movie that's been moldering away in some studio vault somewhere?  You wind up with ""The Legend of God's Gun,"" a movie so unbelievably amateurish and inept that it makes your own home movies look like models of cinematic artistry in comparison.

And the fact that it's ""supposed"" to be bad doesn't make the movie one iota less torturous to sit through.  What it does, in fact, do is make one pine for the days when the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" guys would have a rollicking good time mercilessly skewering such an obvious ""Grindhouse"" wannabe - one that plumbs hitherto unattained depths of awfulness in its race to the bottom.",1283644800,,909,4.70440251572327
8270100,1,B0018LQ964,"I haven't written a review about a item before. Usually there wasn't a need to because the reviews covered everything I would have said. I watched this movie and now have a reason to write a review. There are currently two reviews that give this movie 5 stars when this movie clearly doesn't merit that kind of quality. Everyone has their personal taste and opinions about film, but with that said I am warning all of you that are interested in this movie could find yourselves looking for the return label for the shipping box. I read the reviews on this movie and thought I would rent it first. I am glad I did. The movie boasts a ""Spaghetti Western"" classic style film experience. In my opinion, that isn't what you get.

While watching the first 20 minutes of this film you are introduced to a lot of characters in the movie, sort of like the beginning of ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" but with three times as many people. They set up the who's who for you by doing a freeze frame still shot for everybody, and then flashing their characters role such as ""Gun Slinger"", ""The Bounty Hunter"", ""The Sheriff"", ""Sheriff's Wife"" and the character list goes on. It also seemed that every character they introduced really tried to take the stage. Some actors in this film needed to be told don't go over the top with it, you're not the lead. The movie also has a narrator, which I found annoying during the first part of the film. I think they added him because he could introduce the characters quickly. I can't tell you which ""Spaghetti Western"" I've seen that had a narrator tell me who the characters were, or why he was taking out revenge. Usually I expect the story to unfold this by itself and I could figure out who the good guy was. I prefer the long silent walk the gunslinger takes into town, walks down the street and into a saloon, look around as he walks to the bar and he does all this without a voice telling me that he's quick with a gun and everyone in town fears him. I would rather see him act this out.

Now I am not going to tear this film apart scene by scene according to my taste in film, but my last gripe is about how they tried to achieve an aged movie reel affect like the old un-restored ""Spaghetti Western"" films. The over use of the ""aged film grain"" filter in Final Cut and adjustments to the color quality of the film starts to get on my nerves. It seems like it is covering up something in the film instead of blending in. And the camera work keeps cutting to angle after angle as if this was a new martial arts action film. A ""Spaghetti Western"" film doesn't keep cutting to that many angles until the final showdown where it cuts to their eyes, back to the street, back to their eyes and then to their hand above the gun. I guess the film's motto was ""less talking, more shooting.""

After reading my review you can either just pass by this film, rent it to see it for yourself because you're just too curious, or end up loving it. But you might need to down some whiskey first before you watch it to love it.",1235260800,,3045,4.301393728222997
8270101,5,B0018LQ964,"""Will someone with a gun shut this preacher up?""  Viewers need saddle up for this wild, hallucinogenic gallop through Leoni's classics!  In  ""The Legend of God's Gun,"" a lone preacher in the godless town of Playa Diablo seeks retribution for his lost love, murdered at the hands of venom-sucking bandito, El Sobero.  In the process, the town of plagued villagers is purged of its demonic ills in this twisted rendition of good versus evil.  Conceived by madman and composer Kirpatrick Thomas (the evil, El Sobero), the film is a visual and auditory tribute to the spaghetti western- exploded and deconstructed for your postmodern palette.  Shot, edited, and directed by Mike Bruce (the less than honorable sheriff of Playa Diablo), ""The Legend of God's Gun,"" is a visceral collage that is sure to become a cult phenomenon.

With a ridiculously low budget, a production team (including cast) of about 100, and over three years in the making, the film is a miraculous incarnation by all rights.  Presented in 5.1 surround-sound, the production delivers a dark, orgiastic, and hyperbolic explosion of classic western elements meant to jolt and amuse its audience through spectacle and sound, rather than through logical plot narrative.  With dream sequences that recall some of Fellini's spectral signature, Mike Bruce retains a stylistic savvy that honors its Italian predecessors while it recreates the genre in an aggressive and pioneering format (thanks to Bruce's creative editing.)  Extra features on the DVD include music videos by Gram Rabbit and Spindrift, hilarious outtakes, and behind-the scenes mayhem.

Remarkably, the soundtrack (which precedes the film in its conception) triumphs as a singular achievement that deserves its own attention.  Kirpatrick Thomas is the prolific songwriter and longtime front-man for Spindrift, a Los Angeles based psychedelic rock band whose performances have graced such festivals as Austin's SXSW and Joshua Tree's Clean Air Clean Stars.  Serving as a spiritual catalyst for the film's vile happenings, Kirpatrick's ambient and romantic compositions venerate Morricone's work while his haunting vocal tracks will linger long after the film's viewing.  Musically, the soundtrack offers a sublime debut of Thomas' potential as one of today's great film composers.",1224633600,5,2306,5.441011235955056
