1824745,5,B000083C6L,"Growing up, I was a Strawberry Shortcake fanatic.  I was heartbroken when I tape I had broke.  But then I found out that there were adventures on DVD!  Meet Strawberry Shortcake introduces you to all of the characters.  And it's a great show to teach children morals.  For instance, Meet Strawberry Shortcake tackles the concepts of friendship, sharing, and anti-prejudices.  Custard, Strawberry's cat, is all about her own species.  She eventually learns that others not like her are not that bad.  Great, Great, GREAT!",1057536000,,520,5.107142857142857
1824746,5,B000083C6L,"My daughter loves this movie. It is so cute, we have had it for about a week now and I have seen it about 15-20 times. MUST HAVE.",1055721600,,129,3.642857142857143
1824747,5,B000083C6L,"Thank you for bringing back Strawberry Shortcake!  I am so happy for my daughter (almost 3) to have these dolls and shows to watch.  Like me, she would rather play with ""little girl"" dolls than ""mommy"" Barbies and Stawberry is perfect.  The show is sweet and cute and innocent, like I'd like my daughter to be, not rude like Rugrats, or provocative like the Bratz dolls.  Even my 4-year old son is a ""closet"" Shortcake fan.  She loves the begining song and dances and sings to Straw-straw-straw-straw-berry Shortcake!  If you liked her when you were little, you'll like her again.",1052784000,,580,4.75
1824748,5,B000083C6L,"We have both of the episodes that are out now! My 3 year old loves her Strawberry Shortcake. It is about Strawberry Shortcake and her sister Apple Dumplin who is having her first birthday and they have to go on a fun filled trip to buy all the things that they will need for her birthday party! They go to the cookie shop and help make her cake and meet Orange Blossom and all kinds of new friends! This movie is wonderful! I bought it at first because I used to be a big fan of Strawberry Shortcake as a child when this first came out and I was hoping that she would enjoy it as much as I did as a child. It has very cute songs that my child sings along with it throughtout the movie as well too. Strawberry Shortcake is her favorite character now besides the Care Bears and Barbie, but Strawberry is definitely her number one favorite and her 14 month old sister enjoys both movies as well too. I recommend this movie and the other one for anyone who loves Strawberry Shortcake! I also recommend the Care Bears who are now back as well too to anyone who loves them or has children who love them too. The Care Bears movies she really enjoys as well too even though some people have complained about the evil characters in them and neither one of kids find them a bit scary!",1052352000,,1274,4.204081632653061
1824749,4,B000083C6L,"I got to curl up with my five-year-old daughter last night and watch this DVD with her, something she has been begging me to do since I brought it home for her the other day.  I myself was never a big fan of the original, but my daughters both love all things sticky-sweet!  And this filled the bill.

Strawberry Shortcake has never been strong on story line, and apparently never will be judging by this new version.  It's basically a silly story about two sisters, (one a baby!) who live in a world completely devoid of adults.  They decide to celebrate Apple Dumpling's birthday, (this being the baby sister) and set off to journey around their strange child-world looking for things they will need- cake, cookies, juice, ect.  And surprise- they make many new friends along the way!

The things I like- the animation is lovely and colorful, the interaction between Strawberry Shortcake and her baby sister is great- every mother's unrealized dream for their sibling children.  (Too bad they don't have one to appreciate it!)

The things I don't like- her horrible cat, Custard.  Her puppy can't talk, and you'll quickly wish this rude cat couldn't, either.  And of course, a little story line improvement wouldn't hurt!

Still, I have to give it four stars because Strawberry Shortcake never claims to be more than it is, which is the purest form of entertainment for little girls.  Nothing more, nothing less!  My daughter was completely captivated, giggling and glowing through the entire program- which was at least her fifth or sixth viewing.  She especially loves Pupcake, the little blue puppy that is always getting into trouble.  I smiled a lot too, but mostly at my ridiculously happy daughter!",1049760000,10,1707,4.875
1824750,5,B000083C6L,I was a huge fan of strawberry shortcake when I was a little girl and when I found out that she was coming back out I was just so excited. I bought the DVD for my god-daughter and she loves it. She knows all strawberry shortcakes friends and just adores her little sister apple dumplin and the cutest thing is that the DVD actually smells like strawberries. This was the best gift I have gotten her in a long time and I just love watching it with her and singing along to all the cute songs. I recommend this to any strawberry shortcake fan out there.,1049673600,3,551,4.2075471698113205
1824789,5,B000083C6L,"This is a cute movie as are all her movies -the singing is adorable, and rather catchy, I find myself humming a tune or 2 while it is playing. If you're a Strawberry fan-this is a must have for the collection.",1109721600,2,209,4.121951219512195
1824790,5,B000083C6L,"My daughter received this for Christmas last year and has watched it 20 times or more!  She just loves the story and I think it has a good moral to not judge a person before you get to know them!  This is must have of the Strawberry Shortcake movies so you can learn how Strawberry meets all of her friends.  Although one can't help but wonder why Strawberry has no parents and yet is responsible for taking care of a one year old baby sister.  There are no adults in this fantasy world, but the ""Berry"" friends all seem to be very responsible living in Strawberry Land without them!",1104105600,,583,4.321100917431193
1824791,4,B000083C6L,"Frankly there is a lot of garbage out there that is marketed to our kids, and this video while not perfect is, in my opinion, a much better option than a great number of the shows and cartoons out there.

The themes of caring, sharing, working together and accepting diversity are terrific.  My three year old daughter is enamored with all things SCC.  My six year old boy, also enjoys the music, and identifies with the character ""Huck"".  I just wish there were more non-violent options for little boys.

I will agree with other reviewers that find the cat annoying.  I think the writers were going for a ""Morris the Cat"" type of attitude, but just ended up with a cat that is plain rude-- and is not likeable on any level.",1097366400,,724,4.446969696969697
1824792,4,B000083C6L,"My 6-year-old, like many these days, has a fine collection of videos. Some of these we can watch and enjoy together. Not so with ""Strawberry Shortcake,"" but that's not a problem. Fact is, this introduction to Strawberry, little sister Apple Dumpling, friends Ginger Snap, Angel Cake, etc., and her pets Pupcake and Custard, is as sweet as the characters' names suggests, and everything is aimed at the level of the pre-gradeschool set. It shows these characters working together and solving problems even when they occasionally disagree. It also has a bouncy musical track and a music video after the end titles.

 OK, so the animation is the cheapo kind that the aficianado will carp about. OK, so the plot is silly and the characters one-dimensional. It reaches its audience nicely, tells a positive story, and, frankly, creates a desire for tied-in merchandise. What else is new? My daughter loves it and yours probably will too.",1090454400,4,932,5.006451612903226
1824793,1,B000083C6L,"I think I should say first that a bold warning label should be on each of these new videos: ""CONTAINS POINTLESS PLOTS ALONG WITH WHINING AND SARCASTIC CHARACTERS THAT TEACH UNPLEASANT HABITS TO YOUNG CHILDREN.""
These pointless plots contain contradictory statements such as ""better wait 'til after lunch"" when a cookie was requested even though they just emerged from a ""cookie factory"" (having eaten the whole time they were there), as well as encouraging children to eat chocolate when they are upset, and excusing rude and sarcastic comments with ""Oh, she has a good heart"". This is not even the HALF of it!! I NEED MORE ROOM!",1079481600,4,629,4.88785046728972
1824794,4,B000083C6L,"She watches it over and over again.  I don't remember the original Strawberry Shortcake so I can't comment on whether it does the old one justice or not.  However, my daughter is simply crazy about it.
Things that I like about it:  It's long and the DVD smells like strawberries which is kinda cool.
Things I don't like about it:
The cat is SO annoying.  I normally go for the angry, sarcastic characters but this cat is too much.  I think she should consider relocating to Grouchland where she might be happier.
There is also a lot of talk about eating cookies, cakes, juice, etc.  So much so that, after listening to the sugary-sweet dialogue, I just want to curl up on the couch with a vegetable or two.
Things my two-year-old likes about it:  Everything.",1077235200,2,758,4.529411764705882
1824795,5,B000083C6L,My sister bought my 2 1/2 year old daughter a strawberry shortcake doll and this video.  I would have never thought that she would take to this the way she has.  She adores strawberry and has a smile on her face during the entire video.  I have to admit I like it too and I love the cute little songs!  I am not a 'girls girl' and I swore I would never buy my daughters barbie dolls.  I think this is the cutest video and I am as enamored with SS as my daughter is.  I am searching the web to find SS clothes for her with no luck.  I am a new fan and never knew the old SS.  Can't wait to get her SS items for Christmas presents.,1067385600,,629,3.7846153846153845
1824796,4,B000083C6L,"My daughter just started taking an interest in Strawberry Shortcake after we purchased a SSC book for her. We gave her this DVD for her 3rd birthday and she has watched it countless times since!
This adorable DVD introduces Strawberry Shortcake and her friends to new SSC fans.  Pupcake, Custard, Ginger Snap, Angel Cake, Orange Blossom and Huckleberry Pie are introduced in this story as Strawberry goes on a hunt for treats for her sister Apple Dumpling's bday.  She meets Ginger, Angel, Orange and Huckleberry along the way.
My daughter and her big brother enjoy watching this DVD with its colorful and bright visuals, bouncy songs, cheerful characters (excepting Custard, that is) and themes of friendship and helping one another.  As a parent, I give it two thumbs up!!  The only complaint I may have would be the portrayal of Custard as a grumpy, whiny little cat but at least by the end she learns to appreciate differences in others.  And why does Custard talk but Pupcake doesn't?  Anyway, my kids love the show so - my curiosity aside - in the end this is all that really matters.",1065657600,9,1090,4.7407407407407405

7978699,4,B000083C6L,This is when we first meet Strawberry Shortcake and all her friends. Original movie not the computer animated ones. My daughter loves Strawberry Shortcake as much as I did when I was her age. She can't get enough of the characters. Cute movie.,1411689600,,243,4.674418604651163

We went to the ronald mcdonald house again and the same thing, she couldn't watch it enough.  Now we have it at home.

The only bad thing about this is now the strawberry shortcake song is stuck in my head.",1167868800,,381,4.236111111111111
7978705,5,B000083C6L,"Our granddaughter(who turns 2 years this month)has just recently shown an interest in watching this Strawberry Shortcake DVD which we have had since June. I remember watching a SS show on TV with my daughter in the 80's and although the characters have changed some(different clothes,Custard was always a sarcastic cat,but she didn't talk and Pupcake used to be Huckleberry Pie's dog)the movie has no violence and is a good choice for young children. And even though the voices and dialogue are sugary sweet,this appeals to young children. Kiersten's Grandpa watched this whole 45 minute movie with her and if he can do that,anybody can!!!But whatever happened to all the other SS character and the Purple Pieman and Sour Grapes?My daughter had collected ALL the dolls and their pets and there were MANY of them.",1125964800,,812,5.022222222222222
