6034420,4,B00FWSWIUU,"The film was very well done and that was not an easy thing to do.

If you're a fan of Kerouac, the book itself or movies about alcoholics self-destructing (I know a happy theme to be sure) you'll appreciate the movie.

The only way a book about such a heavy topic worked was because it was filled with Kerouac's amazing prose and he provided the reader insights into alcoholism and the self-loathing that comes with the disorder. Much of the story takes place in Kerouac's head. Thankfully the director understood this and preserved that essential part of the book by including passages from the book narrated by the actor playing Kerouac in the film.

The cinematography is outstanding and the performances by the actors were all very well done.

I definitely liked the movie both in and of itself and as an adaptation of a beloved book.",1383955200,19,838,4.680272108843537
6034421,2,B00FWSWIUU,"Very slowing moving, hard to follow as the story and characters were only thinly developed.  Not really much to grasp on to here.  Though the cinematography was quite beautiful.",1383696000,,177,5.068965517241379
6034422,4,B00FWSWIUU,"Theres an almost sub-genre of literature that deals with writers breaking down, Fitzgeralds Crack-up and Phillip K. Dicks Valis and of course Jack Kerouacs Big Sur.

Big Sur chronicles Kerouacs ever-so-slightly fictionalized account of his disintegration. After fame and success sweeps over Kerouac as King of the Beats and tries to live up to the reputation with a party in every town, or is it a binge? He wants an escape from those pressures and friend Lawrence Ferlinghetti volunteers his rustic cabin at Big Sur. Once there Kerouac faces only himself and soon becomes bored and heads back to San Francisco, friends, acolytes, parties and Neal Cassady. Cassady hooks him up with his mistress Billie who has a son, soon to Cassadys chagrin Kerouac and Billie are having an affair.

Big Sur swings back and forth between action in San Francisco and continued retreats to Big Sur, but Kerouac keeps pulling people up to the cabin in an effort to avoid confronting himself and his deteriorating condition.

The movie has a cigarette tinged, half full bottles of whiskey feel (although the bottles are half full they never seem to empty). Big Sur is like a home movie of the beat generation with narration. The narration, straight from Big Sur starts to work like the narration in Apocalypse Now, it becomes a character in the movie, theres even one scene that seems very reminiscent of Apocalypse whether that is intentional or not is anybodys guess.
The casting of Big Sur seems right on, while there are no extended scenes of action or dialog, the actors look like the people they're supposed to be and director Michael Polish gets a lot of acting from his cast in emotion. Jean-Marc Barr looks right on as the debauched Kerouac, a man who is victim and pained by his own weaknesses Josh Lucas seems the best screen Neal Cassady both in look and characterization, Anthony Edwards makes the most of his premature balding as Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Kate Bosworth is a stunning Billie, Radha Mitchell as Carolyn Cassady has a few good scenes notably when Kerouac brings Billie to meet Carolyn.

Kerouacs books may be too internally driven to make great movies out of, as with the recent filmed version of On The Road the movie relies heavily on the voiceover and Kerouacs writing that unintentionally keeps the audience at arms length. While Big Sur works better as a film than On The Road it still misses something in the translation from book to movie. Big Sur doesnt seem to convey the utter horror Kerouac felt, at the end with Billie and her son, he thought her a witch and the child a sorcerer putting hexes on him. Filmed versions of Kerouacs books may not be a good idea, as much as fans may want to see the movies, but it doesnt like it would translate well to the uninitiated, still this is a good movie that Id be willing to see again.",1383523200,18,2844,4.716297786720322
6034423,4,B00FWSWIUU,"Jack Kerouac and the Beats have been receiving considerable recent attention on film. Following last year's film of ""On the Road"" , there are two new movies about the Beats: ""Kill your Darlings"", which tells the story of Lucien Carr and Allen Ginsberg, and this film adaptation of Kerouac's 1962 novel, ""Big Sur"", directed and with a screenplay by Michael Polish.

As does Kerouac's novel, the film describes the author's mental and physical deterioration resulting from drinking in 1959-1960.. It is set and filmed in Big Sur, Monterrey County, and San Francisco.  The film shows Kerouac receiving a great deal of publicity and adulation that he was unable to handle following the publication of ""On the Road"". Kerouac's friend, Lawrence Ferlinghetti,, offers him the use of his cabin on Big Sur, hoping that nature and isolation will help Kerouac find peace and enable him to write. Instead, Kerouac quickly becomes bored and discontented while drinking heavily. He heads to North Beach to catch up with his friends, continuing to drink.  The movie alternates between scenes in San Francisco and scenes at Big Sur. Kerouac becomes involved with Billie Dabney, the mistress of his friend, Neal Cassady, who has a young son, Elliott. As was the pattern of his life, Kerouac proves unable to commit to Billie. ""You withhold your love"", Billie tells him.

Most of the movie is recounted in a voice-over with Kerouac's rhythmic, ranting voice from ""Big Sur"" accompanying the scenes from the movie. While Kerouac's language is effective, the voice-overs slow the pace of the movie. The scenes in which the movie is told in  dialogue, rather than in Kerouac soliloquizing are more immediate, particularly in the sharp confrontational scenes between Kerouac and Billie and in the moment, late in the film, when Kerouac breaks down from his heavy alcohol abuse.

The movie captures Kerouac's alternating tone of self-laceration and self-pity together with his creative gifts. It captures a sense of loneliness and isolation and inability to connect with others. There are good portrayals of Kerouac's friends, including Neal and Carolyn Cassady, Ferlinghetti, Michael McClure, and Philip Whalen.  Allen Ginsberg, among others, is absent from the film although he is a character in the novel. The film captures the wild beauty of Big Sur and the coast.

Jean Marc-Barr plays Kerouac well, even though the film drags. Other members of the cast include Kate Bosworth as Billie, Josh Lucas and Rhada Mitchell as Neal and Carolyn Cassady, Anthony Edwards as Ferlinghetti, Balthazar Getty as the poet Michael McClure, and Henry Thomas as the poet Phillip Whalen.

The movie captures the feeling of alcoholic deterioration, loneliness, and an inability to connect, characteristics of Kerouac's novel. It is a worthwhile effort at filming a late Kerouac novel and will reward viewing by readers fascinated with Kerouac and the Beats.

6034427,3,B00FWSWIUU,"Big Sur (2013), based on the 1962 book by the enigmatic Jack Kerouac, details the authors three retreats to a friends cabin in the magnificent eponymous location a hundred miles south of San Francisco. Sometimes hes alone and sometimes hes with friends. Kerouac cant handle his fame and success as the leader of the beatniks and so descends into the darkness of alcohol addiction.

While this is a well-made artsy film featuring narrations from the author himself throughout, it's done in by its subject. At least with 1991's ""The Doors,"" which chronicled Jim Morrison's downward spiral, we got great music, entertaining concert footage and colorful characters. ""Big Sur,"" by contrast, only has Kerouac's stream-of-consciousness verbiage (i.e. ""interior monologue"") and the beautiful cinematography of Big Sur. Yes, it's professionally made with a quality cast and it kept my interest for the first 45-50 minutes, but then it just drones on to the bitter end. I hate seeing people waste their talents, especially by their own foolish addictions. Of course this is the only way the story COULD end since it's based on real life. Jack was dead at 47. Despite my criticisms, ""Big Sur"" is worthwhile if the topic interests you and the film's obviously a must for Kerouac fans; it will leave most everyone else bored or depressed.

Interestingly, it was 1957's ""On the Road"" that propelled Jack to beatnik stardom, but he later confessed it ""was really a story about two Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God. And we found him."" Too bad his revelation didn't help him out with his increasing substance abuse.

The film runs a mere 81 minutes and was shot in Big Sur and San Francisco.

If you suffered through the 'On the Road' debacle from a few years back (see my review), then you may cringe (as I did at first) when discovering that another Kerouac book has been made into a movie. But...this one is great! It captures the spirit of the Kerouac's book. Sure, it's desolate and bleak and a bit depressing at times - but so was the book. Kerouac was crashing hard at the time, but had lost none of his literary genius in documenting it. Same goes for ""Big Sur'"" director Michael Polish. He and the entire cast and crew seem to be devoted to staying true to Kerouac's book and vibe, and hats off to them. It works! It's also filmed on location at Big Sur, which brought back many wonderful memories of this magical and timeless part of California.

6034444,2,B00FWSWIUU,"Beautiful cinematography of Big Sur and San Francisco but the story is a disturbing  one. Based on Kerouac's novel of the same name it tells the story of the author's trip to CA to connect with his old friends, especially Cassidy. Now, however, Kerouac and his friends are in their forties and their adolescent antics, mostly heavy drinking and horsing around seem pathetic. Kerouac is very actively drinking himself to death and is portrayed as someone who cannot really connect with anyone. As the movie goes on the level of his despair, severe depression, crippling anxiety and deadly alcoholism becomes hard to watch. He's not a character one can feel any empathy for but rather a very damaged person who seems to have become psychologically derailed in adolescence. All though there are some women characters in this movie, they are simply sex objects for these aging pathetic boys. I couldn't figure out the point of the movie (other than filming a Kerouac novel) and whether there was an intended audience beyond Kerouac fans.  Not being one, I found the manic exuberance of these aging guys sad, self indulgent and irritating. A well made, well acted film.

6034448,3,B00FWSWIUU,"This is a tale (based on Kerouac's book of the same title) about a tortured man.  This man was Kerouac himself.  Kerouac seemed to be fighting several personal demons and he withdrew into the bottle.  The time is 1960 and a Kerouac friend, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, offers Kerouac the use of his Big Sur Cabin located just off CA Hwy 1 on Bixby Creek.  Perhaps Kerouac can find some peace and solace at the cabin.  Unclutter his life, enjoy the beauty of Big Sur.  Does not really turn out that way.  Kerouac, the king of the beats, tells those who will listen that he does not have all the answers.  The film does a good job of staying true to the book.  The book (and film) is rather depressing as it portrays the sadness of a broken and alcoholic man.  Jack and Neal try to get the old magic back but it is gone.  The actor playing Kerouac did a good job.  The film has some great shots of the cabin at Big Sur, the Pacific Ocean, Bixby Creek, SF, City Lights, Hwy 1 etc.  I enjoyed the movie and I think the filmmaker did a good job putting it together.  I applaud both this film and As I lay Dying.  Perhaps these films will turn some on to American literature.

6034451,3,B00FWSWIUU,"Criss-crossing, okay hitch-hiking, tramping the great American night highway, drinking, swilling really, wines, whiskeys, low-rent beers when cash was low, although never real hobo Thunderbirds and sternos, no always just short of that instant madness, chain-smoking Lucky Strikes, king of the unfiltered western night chain, smoking mad reefers, roughing up some sheets with some stray chick, rutting off in some side road ditch if sheets were hard to come by, switching off with karma sutra babes if the feeling was right. Yeah, that was Jack Kerouacs world, Jacks late 1940s be-bop world, the world that he wrote about in On The Road , the one that made a generation drool for the open road, for freedom.

But let's suppose that that free and open road had happened over a decade before Jeanbon set the late 1950s night afire and he tired, drunk, depressed and cramped after three years of being beats king beat he just wanted to chuck it all, just wanted to drink himself into oblivion. Well, then you would get Jacks famous drowned in sorrow, hubris and drink classic, Big Sur, in which he attempted to make one grand final slash at word-smithery to hail the new world he had coined. And one half century later director Michael Polish would come by and adapt those words, those maybe, probably, very possibility, non-cinematically possible words into a film sketch.

Now the plot book or film is really nothing. Jack, in twenty-one conditions of tired of the real world, his real beat world, drunk, stupor drunk, decided to chill himself out in Lawrence Ferlinghettis cabin at Big Sur. And so among the splendors of that section of California hard against the Pacific Coast Highway and the Pacific Ocean he dwelled, for a while. But Jack was fundamentally a social animal, wrote out of a social fist, could only survive by mixing words with others and so he escaped back up the coast to Frisco town to hold forth with  the modern incantation of Dean Moriarty, the very real Neal Cassady. And so they talked, they partied, they exchanged women, they bantered and befuddled each other and all around them in one last hell-broth attempt to rekindle those ancient transcontinental flames that ignited their youth. But shades of forty were hovering over head and so the mood of life on the rim of the world was broken. The beat night shattered to caricature and faux beatness. As Kerouacs mantra hero Thomas Wolfe named his eminent novel-you cant go home again- cant go home again to an idea who time had passed. And so too, in the end, this film is strictly for Kerouac beat generation-be-bop search for the great American West night aficionados. Enough said.",1392854400,,2660,4.854625550660793

6034456,4,B00FWSWIUU,"HEART BEAT, the ambiance accurate but factually inaccurate 1980 film about Kerouac and Cassady, was my first intro to the whole Beat scene.  Ever since that time I have steeped myself in Kerouaciana rather deeply.  Nick Nolte played Neal Cassady in that film - and in 2012's ON THE ROAD, Garrett Hedlund attempted to embody Dean Moriarty who was, in truth, Neal Cassady.  Both prior actors brought their own qualities to the role without achieving total verisimilitude either in visage or personality.  There have been a few others who have attempted to tackle the mercurial nature of the truly astonishing Neal Cassady.  He was tough to pin down in his own time, let alone now!  Ten things at once and never the same thing twice!  Now in BIG SUR we have Josh Lucas as the legendary Neal.  He is a virtual doppleganger to the real thing - and acts his role well and truly.  The thing is there just isn't enough of him in BIG SUR, either book or film.  Someone should make a movie with Neal as the centerpiece and cast Josh Lucas in the part before the parade passes.  Neal's story after his sudden fame due to ON THE ROAD would make a top-notch film: from San Quentin for the ludicrous two years for pot possession (and now you can buy it in the state where Neal grew up!), to taking the wheel of Ken Kesey's psychedelic bus 'Further', on to his early and mysterious death in Mexico - terrific movie material and in Josh Lucas a convincing and compelling Cassady.  Maybe one day...

As to BIG SUR, it is a beautifully photographed and scored and narrated by Jean-Marc Barr as Kerouac movie.  I enjoyed it immensely.  Is it perfect?  No.  The actor playing Kerouac is, I believe, bald.  In fitting him with a wig to play Kerouac I wish they'd fitted him with more of it!  And blue contacts would have been nice to capture the real writer's ""amazingly blue eyes.""  This isn't picayune.  Why get the costumes and cars accurate, but not the eyes and hairstyle?  I just watched Ed Harris as Beethoven - and in the movie he wore contacts and a wig on his balding head to better create the look of the historical man. But apart from the hair and the eyes and Jean-Marc Barr's being nowhere near the handsomeness of the real deal, he acts his role for the most part brilliantly. His narration - though fast and scrolling - has been criticized by some.  But that was how the real writer read his works aloud. For the most part BIG SUR is a very good adaptation of the same titled book.  Of course no movie can ever truly and completely capture a book.  They are two different art forms.  Was MOBY DICK the movie all of Melville?  Certainly not, but it was a good movie and captured much essence in its sight and sound.  UNDER THE VOLCANO is an impossible-to-film book - yet Huston's film of it caught some very real lightening in a bottle.

Anyway, if you are interested or curious or just toe-dipping into the waters of the Beats, this is a very good film.  As HEART BEAT led me to want to learn more, this may well do likewise for current and future viewers.  A small consideration, however: if you know little or nothing about Jack Kerouac and his circle of friends and his literary life, this movie may seem quite obscure.  A quick boning up on some Wikipedia entries might remedy that - and then the film can be enjoyed more fully and on its own level.

Well done - and worthwhile!!!",1390348800,9,3379,4.442276422764228

Although ""On the Road ""received a lot more hype, I found this film far superior in many ways. Big Sur deals more with Kerouac's fame and misfortunes after his famous novel is published, and his alcoholism is pretty advanced here, as well as a mental breakdown. He struggles to find himself and his battles with fame. It's a well adapted movie and the actor who plays Kerouac is MUCH better than almost any Kerouac I have seen on screen. The other characters in this are poets and outdoors people, as well as the City Lights bookstore owner Lawrence Felinghetti. I enjoy this and so glad I bought.

6034461,2,B00FWSWIUU,"Unless you are a true follower of Jack Kerouac you will be lost in this film. A true throwback to the 50's and the 60's, you will see some great old cars and vintage antiques. There are some good performances, well photographed, but hard to follow all the narration.",1386806400,,266,4.448979591836735
6034462,5,B00FWSWIUU,Excellent photography and acting. Jean-Marc Barr was great as Keraouc. The subject matter was dark but it is a good example of the beat generation.,1384819200,,147,4.92
6034463,2,B00FWSWIUU,"At this distance, the literary figures as depicted are not particularly interesting, and the screen play doesn't create any additional frisson.",1384732800,,143,5.857142857142857
8618992,5,B00FWSWIUU,"Movie closely follows the book.  At times it seems like a long poem as the narration is composed of Kerouac's own words.  The book should be read before viewing the movie.  My only disappointment was the soundtrack.  I expected the music to be a bigger part of the story (as in the
Subterrananeans  which was not a great movie but had great jazz and jazz musicians).  The picture gives a good incite into the real Kerouac.",1518307200,,422,4.4868421052631575
8618993,1,B00FWSWIUU,"I actually could not finish watching this movie.
A waste of a good title.",1510185600,,73,4.285714285714286
8618994,4,B00FWSWIUU,"It accurately depicts Jack Kerouac's description of his fall into drug and alcohol addiction.  A large part of the movie shows him struggling in substance induced psychosis and paranoia--the movie maker using Kerouac's own words from his book, ""Big Sur.""  Shortly after Kerouac wrote the book, he died from substance abuse.  If you love Kerouac's work, you will want to see the film.  But, like the book, it is hard to see one more wonderful, brilliant soul having fallen to addiction.  The film maker did an incredible job of relaying Kerouac's last and this time, selfless message.  4 Stars instead of 5?  It's intense at times--but no fault of the film maker, just the subject matter.  The scenery, as it is largely shot in Big Sur, is breathtaking.  You can feel what it was like to have lived there at the time.",1496016000,,816,4.690140845070423
8618995,2,B00FWSWIUU,The 1980s Levolor miniblinds in the kitchen scene are a major fail.,1492473600,,67,4.666666666666667
8618996,5,B00FWSWIUU,Thought this was a good solid interpretation of kerouacs novel. All the acting was credible and interesting. Will Dharma Bums ever be done?,1488672000,,139,5.086956521739131
8618997,2,B00FWSWIUU,"Pretty weak attempt at adapting Kerouac.  Lots of voice over, the film can't stand alone without knowledge of the book.  Even if you've read the book, the film is still a mess.",1487548800,,176,4.46875
8618998,5,B00FWSWIUU,"The difficulty & near impossibility of translating Jack Kerouac's books to film lies in the power of the books: the inexhaustible prose style. It's not just about what happens; it's about how what happens is described, from the inside out, in a torrent of seemingly chaotic but always connected language. The filmmakers of ""On the Road"" tried their best, but couldn't quite pull it off -- but this smaller, more modest adaptation of ""Big Sur"" is as close as anyone's gotten so far to capturing the essence of Kerouac on film.

First of all, the casting is superb, with the main characters not only looking like the real people they're playing, but seeming like them as well; it's not just about surface resemblance. The cinematography is gorgeous, with the beauties of Big Sur, the sea, the shore, forest, the night sky; and the city locations as well. The big mistake many period films make is to overdo everything, so that the actors & the sets look dressed up, not lived in. ""Big Sur"" takes a more casual approach, getting the look & tone & telling little details without lingering over them or calling attention to them.

But the real risk & genius of the film is that it's largely voiceover, using the text of the book as the stream-of-consciousness it is on the page: frantic, reflective, tortured, painfully self-aware, spiritually seeking, spiritually lost, tinged with fleeting joys. Because the language IS Kerouac, more than anything else, far more than the easy & insulting clich of the King of the Beatniks -- it rushes, it spills, it pools, it overwhelms -- but it's always in motion, observing everything, noting its own ever-shifting emotions -- offering up the naked, tender-hearted vulnerability of a gifted man losing himself & knowing it, but unable to stop it, even as he dreams of & strives for that golden eternity he'll never reach.

This won't appeal to everyone, of course. It makes almost no concessions to the mainstream audience & its expectations of what a film should be -- but that's all to the good, because in maintaining its integrity, it does justice to one of America's great writers & presents his life & work honestly -- most highly recommended!",1475107200,2,2184,4.834224598930481
8618999,4,B00FWSWIUU,Anything with Stana Katic in it is going to be great because she's an amazing actress.,1472256000,,86,4.4375
8619000,5,B00FWSWIUU,"No Kerouac or Beat Generation work has ever been given a more accurate translation to screen: Every character is well cast; no one is reduced to a cartoon level; no detail has gone missing; Big Sur itself is stunning.  It is close to perfect. If the end of the film feels rushed- as if Jack is clutching at a Catholic salvation- over and out- its because the novel suffers from the same abrupt closure.  He is trying to convince himself that he will heal, that he will survive, and we all know that he doesn't. SO, if you care about Kerouac's work, this overlooked jewel, clocking in at under 90 minutes, is well worth the five bucks Amazon is asking for it. Trust me.",1466380800,3,668,4.379032258064516
8619001,1,B00FWSWIUU,"Without doubt, the worst movie about any one of the beats. It is like some of those endless 1960 foreign films that have no plot except the viewer really wondering when this boredom will stop. Ok, we know Kerouac descended into being a nasty alcoholic with a ''bloated'' face--see the interview with William Buckley on A Firing Line. See how handsome the once acclaimed most handsome of the beats looks after an endless supply of alcohol. Ok, if he might have tried a program maybe he would have lived longer, but even if he ever was a dry alcoholic (no booze, but no program) he would be the typical s.o.b. that they are.
Kerouac was a genius--as were Ginsberg and Burroughs -- the other two notable ""Beats,"" but this movie is one of the all-time worst movies. Bits of Kerouac's prose/poetry do not suffice to make this view-able.",1465344000,2,831,4.621621621621622
