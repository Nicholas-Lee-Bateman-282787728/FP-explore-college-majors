8534262,2,B0091JJ1QU,"Sarah (Stephanie French) has bad dreams and people around her die. Detective Scott Aro (David Fine) believes she is not the killer and has been chasing said killer for 10 years. The story takes place in Fresno as Sarah works at a nursing home. I found the plot to be okay and horror effects low budget, but effective. The main problem is the dialogue and acting was bad. Stephanie French was horrible in her role. I suggest she was cast because she was able to sing a solo. David Fine and the support cast also left much to be desired, especially his fellow policemen. The dialogue and cast took what could have been a decent film into one not worth viewing.

Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1420070400,,694,4.464566929133858
8534263,4,B0091JJ1QU,"This isn't the largest budget movie, but the acting is good, the writing is good, and you care about the characters.
There are plenty of scares, suspense and mystery throughout, and even a surprising amount of T&A interspersed
here and there to make it even more interesting!
The songs during the end credits, especially the second, mellower one are pretty good too.",1400716800,,366,4.919354838709677
8534264,5,B0091JJ1QU,"Edge of seat scary not to violent. Acting is good especially for theses types of film,definitely a film to see if you like suspense thrillers.",1388793600,,142,4.72
8534265,4,B0091JJ1QU,"Stars : David Fine & Stephanie French
A Matt Sconce flick.

Watched STRICKEN and was cheering at its pure horror elements,Is That Wrong ?

Poor girl lost her mom,then her dad,then her boyfriendWait a second they all have her in commonOR do they ???

The effects are most inspiring,Really impressive ,Especially when you see lots of FRESNO landmarks and Highway 41 referenced.

David Fine gives this Steve Railsback vibe, Google that actor younguns .

David Fine has set a watermark in the last year,That only one other actor has Bill Oberst Jr,You might wanna see some of his work too,WOW dudes you are Creepy Cool !

Matt Sconce does so many genres in his filmmaking journey,Matt this was an Out Of The Park effort,Loved the acting,make-up and just pure evil that was on surface.",1385942400,,780,4.7835820895522385

8534268,4,B0091JJ1QU,This is a fun movie! It is an Alfred Hitchcock style thriller that builds slowly to a big ending.  It is pretty ambitious but a fun ride.,1353888000,,137,4.074074074074074
