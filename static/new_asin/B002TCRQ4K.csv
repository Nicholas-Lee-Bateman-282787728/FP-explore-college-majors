8380066,5,B002TCRQ4K,This is a fascinating story!  One of my neighbors was part of the special forces mentioned in this movie.  I am floored by it!,1441324800,,126,4.208333333333333
8380067,5,B002TCRQ4K,This was an amazing story I had never heard of these small people who saved so many lives;  I lent this to my world war II father and he had never heard of this either..,1371686400,,169,3.8285714285714287
8380068,4,B002TCRQ4K,"All in all, this was an excellent film. I collected Dayak and other Tribal art for a number of years and there are a few pictures in this film that unfortunately are not correct. Most pictures in the film show Dayak's from Borneo, but mixed among them are pictures of Papuans from New Guinea, two different islands and two different cultures. In one instance there is a picture of the Australian officer getting a Tattoo from a Dayak. The person giving him the tattoo is not Dayak he is Papuan (New Guinea) which is obvious from his features and his hair. In another picture we see tribesmen with extended plates in their lips, these are either indigenous peoples of Africa, where some tribal groups (Sara and Makonde peoples) practice this custom or perhaps another island in the South Pacific, but definitely not Dayak. Dayak's never used plates to extend their lips. The only extensions they did were to their ear lobes, using heavy Brass earrings. A number of photos of tribal ceremonies were filmed in New Guinea, the dancers were obviously Papuan and not Dayaks from Borneo. There is a distinct difference facially and physically between the Dayak peoples of Borneo and the Papuans of New Guinea and other indigenous peoples of the South Pacific. The Dayak's have Asian features more like Malaysians (Malays), while the Papuans have features very similar to the Aborigines of Australia. The Dayaks are also smaller in statue than the Papuans, who tend to be large boned people. Culturally both Dayak's and Papuans were head hunters and animists, and both cultures engaged occasionally in fierce tribal wars with neighboring tribes, but there most of the similarities end. An intriguing film, I just wish they had been a little more accurate. The Dayak peoples on their own have a fascinating history as a warrior culture. Their complicated Aso artistic designs and tattoos are steeped in mystical animism, while Borneo remains one of the few relatively unspoiled places left on this planet.",1339632000,,1996,4.961194029850747
8380069,4,B002TCRQ4K,"I read the book (same title) by Judith M. Heimann just prior to watching this. While the video is a condensed recounting of this facinating story, it provides a lot more visual representation and first-person interviews. These additional elements provide a lot more immediacy that the book simply can't deliver. If you're a history buff, you'll definitely enjoy this. It is also enlightening and entertaining if you've never examined any of the events of this era that occurred in the Pacific Theater area of WW2. I recommend buying both the video and the book.

8380070,5,B002TCRQ4K,"Anyone who at least occasionally watches the PBS series, ""Secrets of The Dead"", will love this episode.  Without giving too much away, the ""Airmen and the Headhunters"" recounts the adventures of US Air Force pilots during WWII.  The pilots are shot down and land in Borneo where they develop a seemingly unlikely alliance with natives who help to defend the airmen against Japanese troops.  This documentary reveals how natives were able to use their wits, ancient weapons, and traditions to deal with armed Japanese soldiers.  Unbelievable but true!

This is what makes this episode of ""Secrets of The Dead"" so special.  This episode is guaranteed to make any viewer interested (really).

Highly recommended.",1315353600,,709,5.221238938053097
8380071,5,B002TCRQ4K,"Its a little hard to keep track of the town names and the local characters, but it is very interesting reading, particularly because it is a true story; it is not fiction.  It gives some insight into the enormous sacrifices made by our young men in WWII.  We owe so much them.",1284163200,2,276,4.288461538461538
8380072,4,B002TCRQ4K,"It's easy to see the title and assume it means ""the airmen VERSUS the headhunters.""  In actuality, this documentary could have been titled, ""When the airmen and the headhunters are on the same team.""  This shows an instant during WWII when white soldiers and the indigenous of Borneo struggled against the Japanese.
I'm almost not sure if this work should be in the ""Secrets of the Dead"" series.  This work did not focus on mummies, crypts, or unmarked graves.  I guess the headhunting in the title somehow connects this work to the dead.  The work looks positively on how Westerners changed their minds on headhunting.  However, I would say this is the scourge of colonialism and imperialism in that invaders say ""Don't do X!"" and then ""Do X!"" when it serves their purpose.  People all of the globe heard missionaries say, ""Only get busy within marriage,"" but then saw invading soldiers getting busy with every native woman in sight.  I'm not sure if colonial hypocrisy should be celebrated, even when it leads to a happy ending.
Too often, works about international interactions are only told by Westerns.  This work breaks that trend by showing Westerners and Easterners.  Further those groups are diversified: one group had American, Australian, and British interviewees and the other group should men from more than one tribe.  This documentary is based upon a history book written by a woman and she gets interviewed here.  Thus, there was an attempt at gender diversity.
Some people just love, love, love documentaries detailing the WWII era.  Those people should love this.  Even outside of that circle, many will enjoy the David v. Goliath tale here.  In the very awful ""Aliens v. Predators,"" the main actress spoke an important line, ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend.""  That principle gets exemplified well in this work.",1259280000,,1833,4.9411764705882355
