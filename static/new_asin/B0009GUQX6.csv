So she changed from enthusiastically watching it (in segments over 3 evenings) to calling it the worst movie ever!",1401667200,,291,4.509433962264151

This is a wonderful story. Beautiful filming and scenery. There is much to learn from this tale of a young boy and his simple life and love for his friend, a rescued pelican. Wonderful acting, a dvd not to miss.",1227744000,5,220,4.390243902439025
2289327,3,B0009GUQX6,"Storm Boy won the Best Picture award from the Australian Academy when it was originally made and the trophy was well merited for this is an engaging and pictorially elegant movie that while aimed at children does not insult the intelligence of the adult viewer.

Based on an acclaimed juvenile novel of the same name ( by Colin Thiele)it tells the story of 10 year old Mike (Greg Rowe)who lives with his fisherman father (Peter Cummins) .His Dad is barely making a living ,the pair live in a delapidated beach shack and his Dad gets by selling his catch to the local fishmonger .Nearby there is a bird sanctuary and Mike develops a strong baond with a baby pelican ,encouraged by an outcast Aboriginal mystic,Fingerbone Bill (David Gulpilil)who bestows the Storm Boy nickname on Mike .

Mike and Bill are outcasts from their respective groups -Bill is a mystic and a nomad while Mike is isolated by poverty and his father's fringe status in local society

The story is one of the developing relationship between Mike and the bird and underlying this his coming to terms with who he is and how he can shape his own future

Ravishing photography of the rugged coastline of South Australia ,some assured direction and a neat script make this an unassuming pleasure very suitable for the family audience",1121817600,7,1299,4.76

2289341,5,B0009GUQX6,"Beautiful scenery is the setting for a boy living near a swamp/ocean preservation reserve.  The boy shows a natural fluid relationship with nature and a special bond formed with a pelican. His curiosity about nature and his love of animals dominate this film. He has a loving bond, as well as, sometimes conflictual issues with his Father.  The love between them triumphs over all of their problems. The movie is lush and flowing as it transitions the laws of nature and its relationship to the people living in it.",1425945600,2,515,4.775280898876405

2289346,5,B0009GUQX6,"This was a moving story.  It is so unfortunate that white people (generically and genetically speaking) have no regard for non-white people and other life forms, even for white people non-conforming to white man culture.  This is true even in America unfortunately.  The story demonstrates the deep connection a native of the land has with the indigenous species and the land through the eyes of a child who is non-conforming to white man culture and meanwhile the unfortunate disregard and total disconnect as well as illogical and senseless motivations of white man pertaining to all life on Earth.  Greg Rowe did a fantastic job in my opinion in representing the eyes of a child of the brutal reality of white man culture as the son of a humble white man, his exceptional, loving father.  I think that it is awesome that Rowe is now active in reversing the destruction of the once beautiful locations that were preserved by the movie itself.  This preservation is fortunate to have because we need this evidence to show how unfortunate white man's effect has had on the Earth wherever he has imposed his lawless influence in spite of the laws he imposes on others.  The effect of white man in the film is Australia, but the only places where natural resources are destroyed or at risk of being destroyed are located where the effects of white man has been imposed.  Yes, white man, for the most part, is a terrorist to the indigenous species and natives of the lands where he comes to exist.  This is not a racist claim as much as it is a historical fact, but more than anything, this movie is a reminder that white man is like the Islamic State (a faux pas name, FYI) which needs a muzzle and a leash like an untamed pit bull raised to attack and kill.",1413936000,,1756,4.584664536741214
