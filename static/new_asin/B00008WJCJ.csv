1865017,5,B00008WJCJ,"I happened to catch this gem of a flick in a small Portland, Or. theater on a whim in 2002. I've been looking it to own ever since. This movie takes every cliche and element of asian cinema and blows it up. The beginning of fast paced, very brutal and very stylish. The overall story is very tragic, noble and honorable. Then comes the ending...very unexpected and one of the best I've ever seen. I can't say what happens but there is no way it can ever be beat.",1049414400,2,462,4.202247191011236
1865018,4,B00008WJCJ,"Dead or Alive is a truly strange satire of the Japanese gangsta' film genre, with MANY surprises.  Not for the faint of stomach, but also not to be taken seriously, this film has one of the most fitting Japanese film endings of all time.",1048636800,2,237,4.386363636363637
1865019,2,B00008WJCJ,"Before I watched this I saw the wide range of Takasha Miike's talents as a director, with the sadistic blood bath that was Ichi the Killer, the tension filled Audition, the creepy and bizarre Visitor Q, and the explosive action packed 13 Assassins. While you can argue about how far Miike takes shock value it's still pretty amazing how many movies the man can produce in such a short time.

But enough cock jockeying.

I popped Dead or Alive into the DVD player giddy with excitement on what next bizarre journey Takasha Miike would take me, and the first ten minutes was quite an opening, showing a bunch of random acts of violence to heavy metal in the background, grabbed my attention! After that though the movie nosedives into the ground faster than Lindsey Blohan into a pile of coke, as DoA turns into some predictable cheesey mafia soap opera. A gang member's little brother wants to be part of the older brother's gang, and he is like ""no, it's too dangerous, stay in school and don't do drugs"", while his rival the cop needs money to pay for his daughters expensive surgery, so the allure of crime is tempting him. Sound familiar? This is basically all of the movie, is dragging these scenes and what little character the main two guys have over 2 hours. There are random grotesque acts littered here and there but they seem unnecessary to the plot and just a way to maintain the audience's attention, but what does a dog inseminating a woman have to do with ANYTHING? Oooh I'm so shocked right now, better keep watching.

Then there's the ending... (Spoilers, duh) finally the two have their showdown, after what seems like hours of melodrama they finally face off in the middle of nowhere, one of them fires a rocket launcher while the other throws some dragon ball z energy ball and the world explod-THE END!... what? That's it? After trying so desperately to get the audience attached to the characters and story this is how you end it? At least with the relatively tame showdown to Ichi the Killer it kept playing with your expectations, but the world exploding? That's just stupid, it's like suddenly Miike decided to make it a silly slapstick in the last 40 seconds which completely contradicts the rest of this 2 hour plodder.

All in all the experience is a little jarring, but mostly boring as it tries to be exciting over the top action in the beggining/ending, but the whole centerpiece is one long dull sagging melodrama story you've seen a million times before. I guess they can't all be homeruns from Miike...",1329091200,,2535,4.6644295302013425
1865020,5,B00008WJCJ,"If you like Yakuza movies, Asian gangster film or simply the Tarantinoesque edgy genre, then buy it.  Along with ICHI THE KILLER, this one is a must have Takashi Miike film.  While the DEAD OR ALIVE sequels are interesting, this is by far the best of the series.  The last 30 seconds of the film are a little outlandish but the rest of the film more than makes up for it.  See why Riki Takeuchi is revered as a Yakuza thug and a Japanese icon.  The opening sequence is creative, kinetic and undeniably cool.

Miike unapologetically makes films he would like to see without regard for social convention or concern for popularity.  As such, he is a filmmaker all students and fans of films should see.

Is it Academy Award caliber?  Come on.  Not every film has to be CITZEN KANE.  Some films can just be fun, especially if you have a twisted and dark sense of humor.  If so, don't pass this one up.",1222128000,,897,4.36969696969697
1865021,5,B00008WJCJ,"Takashi Mike's audacity and versatility  are incredible: he explores paths that no one dares to step on, he goes far beyond the permited limits in surrealism and crude mind-blowing violence, he examines social and psychological aspects about honor, friendship, family and brotherhood with such an artistic emotional aproach, while describing the horror and torments implied in the suburban yakuza world with the most gruesome display of excess and graphic cruel liberty ever portrayed on films of the genre. The atmosphere can be described as an astonishing and often melancholic urban fever.

 ""Dead or Alive"" in its 2000 uncut release stays among the most depraved visions and solid achievements in the contemporary Asian ganster film genre, with its rapid-fire cerebral style and surrealist ambient. Some of the very atrocities described in this unique and stylized paralel dimension of a crime film, includes sexual deviations that can't  even be mentioned, extense drug abuse, shattered moral values, dysfunctional psychopaths, mayhem, ravaging aesthetics in bullet-ballet non-stop action, visceral drama, inhumanity and indiference. The list goes on, but the very first 5 minutes of the film is a video-clip of the most violent and painful assasinations, a crude introduction to this shocking reality. Anything can happen in this totally unpredictable film packed with the most visceral and tense action sequences of the last decade.

Between the declared and bloody war of the japanese yakuza and a gang of  violent chinese inmigrants lead by stone cold killer and charismatic ganster Ryuichi (Ricky Takeushi with a hairstyle and attitude that surprises), comes the narcotics cop Jojima (Sho Aikawa), overwhelmed with financial and family problems and desperatly looking for the criminals involved in the constant massacres and bloody-ballistic showdowns. In is path he meets Ryuichi, and so begin a relentless confrontation that ends in a cataclysmic encounter of unexpected proportions.

The precious familiar moments and reunions of the chinese gang are beautifully portrayed, never leaving the tone and aesthetic of Takashi Mike's sharp and intelligent disection of emotional and cultural aspects. This is without a trace of doubt, the best and most complete work of his controversial filmography (audition/ ichi the killer/ visitor Q) and one of the most crude visions and perversions of the crime underworld.

Highly recomended for fans of asian style and action cinema, this is a ganster film you won't expected at all. Shocking and entertaining experience",1207612800,2,2570,5.521628498727735
1865022,3,B00008WJCJ,"Dead or Alive (Takashi Miike, 1999)

The first one hundred minutes of Takashi Miike's Dead or Alive are setup for the last five, a climactic battle between Ryuichi (Miike regular Riki Takeuchi), a Chinese-born gangster, and Jojima (Sho Aikawa, also a Miike regular), a Japanese detective who's been tracking him. You know this will not be your normal finale when, just before it begins, Takeuchi breaks the fourth wall and says ""here comes the final scene!"" And, true to the wonder that is Takashi Miike, this is in no way your normal finale. You have to kind of expect it, though; the rest of the film is realistic, far more so than most of Miike's work. So much so, in fact, that you may feel the need to shower after watching it.

Yeah, there's a plot, and it deals with many of the themes that can be found in most of Miike's work-- alienation, rootlessness, the depravity of modern Japanese society, the yakuza-- but does it matter? In case it does: Ryuichi is a Chinese-born yakuza who's fed up with the way the organization works. He and his loyalists decide to seize control of the drug trade from Taiwan. This, of course, involves a lot of stuff blowing up. Jojima, the voice of the police force, is torn between having to clean up Ryuichi's mess and wondering why he should; after all, Ryuichi is basically doing his job for him. But that doesn't matter. It's all setup, and it's the final scene where the genius of Miike comes shining through. The battle begins in the same realistic manner as the rest of the film, but without spoiling it for you if you haven't seen this yet, let's just say it gets... different. A whole lot different.

I'm a big fan of Takashi Miike's, and when he's working with two of his favorite actors, I can pretty much guarantee you a violent fun time. Such is the case here; there's some depth to be found if you're looking for it, especially if you know more of Miike's work (he's expanding here on the themes he traced with insight and precision in the Black Society trilogy), but it's not necessary to enjoy the movie, which is just an all-around shoot-em-up good time. ***",1206403200,,2115,4.545931758530184
1865023,3,B00008WJCJ,"My review of ""Dead Or Alive,"" refers to the region 4 import. I have been viewing a wide range of films the last 3 weeks. Running the gamut from horror, comedy, thriller, drama, and action films. I only own a few of Miike's yakuza films, and while this one is interesting, I did not find it that great a film as so many other viewers did. I'll save those higher ratings for ""Yakuza Demon,"" and ""Rainy Dog."" When I first saw this film I sort of had the feeling that this was not going to be my type of yakuza film. While the film starts off interesting enough, especially with the hits against the other gangsters, there were too many strange elements in the films opening scenes that I just knew were going to lead this film toward a strange direction. And this was further strengthened by the hit in the mens restroom. Those who have seen this film will know what I am writing about. I expect anything and everything from a Miike film. So it did not surprise me as much as it should have.

Still, this film is a far cry from some of his more serious yakuza films that I have enjoyed. The films narrative begins quite impressive actually. With the excellent soundtrack of rock blasting away as the film opens up, the viewer is witness to a cluster of mob hits. For the first ten minutes or so of the film, I actually liked it. [Not to mention the strange hit on the guy eating noodles]. However, things began to go downhill from there for me. Maybe I'm just a bit too picky about my yakuza films. Anyway, Ryuichi (Riki Takeuchi) is the main culprit behind these attacks. He is Japanese, however, he was born in China. And in Japanese society this means he is lower down the hierarchy than other Japanese and is in a sense, is a second-class citizen [As a sidenote: The legendary Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune was born and raised in China, and did not step foot in Japan until he was nearly 21 years old---after being drafted into the Japanese Air Force in WWII]. Since Ryuichi has nothing to lose [other than his life] he wages war against anyone: Chinese or Japanese. With the drug war waging in Yokohama between the Chinese triads and the Japanese yakuza, he feels he can offset both sides when he discovers they are in the process of forging a partnership together, and thus excluding everyone from their turf.

However, this is not going to be as easy as he thinks. Hot on his trail is the Japanese detective Jojima (Sho Aikawa). And if any of you viewers have not seen the film ""RAINY DOG"" by Miike, and starring Sho Aikawa, I highly recommend the film. The part of this film which was really weird for me [and there are plenty] deals with actor Renji Ishibashi who is a regular of Miikes' films. The part dealing with a woman and excrement, well that was downright weird. But I digress, after all, this is a Miike film, and in this film world of his anything goes. However, I still think that was just a very weird scene. Anyway, the film never captured me after the beginning of the film. The interaction between Detective Jojima and the gangster Ryuichi seesaws into a struggle of who will vanquish the other first. Moreover, when these two finally clash in the grand finale the viewer is in for one strange and surreal send off. I actually still laugh from the films ending no matter how times I see it. It is just too bizarre to describe. Furthermore, I do not wish to ruin it for those who have not seen it. I recommend the film with caution. This is not a particular favorite of mine, but it may appeal to others.",1192579200,4,3524,4.411674347158218
1865024,3,B00008WJCJ,"Director Takashi Miike not only pushes the envelope open in Dead or Alive...he not only rips the envelope apart...he stomps on the envelope, burns it, spills acid on it, and then shoots it into space.

More than other films of Miike's I've seen, this film goes out of its way to get into your face.

I will try to avoid SPOILERS, but be warned...warned that spoilers won't make any difference.  The plot does not make any real difference.  It's all in the scene by scene.

Dead or Alive is essentially the story of a police officer and the yakuza he hunts.  The yakuza, if I am using the term right, is a Chinese gangster involved in importing drugs into Japan.  The Japanese police officer is trying to stop him.

The film begins with a riotous collection of short scenes where pretty much everyone gets it.  Hard to think who's left for the rest of the film, but there are survivors.  Imagine a film that is mostly the last crazy scene of The Bunch, multiply it by Team America (uncut)'s ""times one thousand"", and you may start to get an idea of what this film is like.

The film is set in modern Japan that is a Sodom and Gomorrah lookalike.  I mean that in the strongest terms possible.  This is a direct to video film where anything goes.  There is violence aplenty.  There is also ample nude flesh (of course it is female flesh, often rubbed directly into the camera's eye).  It is more exploitive than, say, Ichi The Killer in its use of women, and at times is offensive if you're not a fanboy who needs a date.  The women are more 'victims' than in some other Miike films.  Yet, as is the case with this brilliant, prolific director, it ain't quite that simple, either.

Nor is the relationship between the two lead characters, the Japanese police officer and the Chinese gangster, all that simple either.  It is not clear what the relationship of the police officer is to the gangsters.  He is emotionally separate from his wife (who may be having an affair) and his daughter--he sleeps on the couch and barely talks to either one of them.  In fact, they both seem a drain on him.

On the flip side, the gangster is a ruthless fellow, ready to take a chance at commiting suicide in a Russian roulette game, but yet he supports his kid brother in college.  He is loyal to his friends, and is most deeply offended when one of his friends betrays him--he shows pretty much the most emotion in the film when he discovers this betrayal.

Both the cop and gangster have their own code of ethics, their own flaws.  Although it takes quite a bit to get beyond the violence, once you do there are layers here that are not obvious on the first viewing.

Unfortunately, Miike often seems interested in simply shocking the viewer at times, or at the very least seeing just how far he can go.  This fits with the Soddom and Gomorrah theme, but be warned it ain't pretty.

There are also some pacing lapses, and a lot of the violence feels repetitious.  The ending, without giving it away too much, is a showdown between the two main characters.  It gets, shall we say, very ridiculous, with a humour that was absent from the rest of the film.  Whether it works or not depends on you, of course.  For me, it worked only in the sense that, like the film, it kept getting more and more extreme.

The reptition, the violence just for the violence's sake, and the pretty nasty exploitation of women are why this film gets three stars instead of more.",1163030400,3,3441,4.4528
1865025,1,B00008WJCJ,"I tried for three consecutive nights to make it through this movie and couldn't do it.  As the Amazon reviewer noted, it is hard to tell the characters apart, and this adds confusion to the boredom and repulsion.  The plot didn't capture me at all, and the so-called sensational action was very predictable and campy.  I guess if you're into seeing a woman have sex with a dog, and other defilements, this might be of interest to you.

I love all types of obscure stuff out of Japan, but this falls way short.  I advise that you rent before you buy as you may be disappointed by this even if it sounds like it might be in one of your collection genres.",1155686400,4,652,4.311475409836065
1865026,3,B00008WJCJ,"Let me start by saying Miike is a genious.

but this one wasn't that great.  The violence was great.  The charachters were pretty good.  The story was o.k.  And the ending was friggin awesome until the very last thing that happens.  I thought that that was garbage, but thats just my opinion.  There are probably so many people that think thats what made that movie so great.

1865027,5,B00008WJCJ,"What can I say - I saw an earlier review that said this movie had the best opening and ending of all time - that is pretty accurate. You see a bit (although nothing like Ichi) of the violent excess that Miike wants to give you, but he adds a very touching element that deals with the loss of a close family member (Ryuichi's little brother Toji, and Jojima's wife and daughter) and creates an excellent (albeit intense), emotional plot line that delivers from the first second to the very last.

Classic, brilliant Miike, perhaps one of his best.",1145232000,,546,4.515151515151516
1865028,5,B00008WJCJ,"This is the first time I have ever done a review of a film. I can honestly say that if you haven't seen this film, you should really check it out. It is fast paced action, and Takashi Miike is the only director who can pull something like this off. Don't just stop here, continue the trilogy and just have a good time watching these  films that should be in everyones collection.

I have read all the reviews and they all summarize the plot real well, so I am not going to get all into that. If you have ever seen Audition or Ichi the Killer, then this is highly recommended.",1138579200,,575,4.171171171171171

You won't see this on TV, because its all in your face and pretty raw but all very entertaining stuff from Japan!

1865030,5,B00008WJCJ,"After seeing Ichi the killer and Audition, I was hooked. Now, I'm flat out addicted! Dead or Alive is such an insane movie. The whole opening sequence is cool and done with style. And yeah, people say the movie slows down a bit during the middle, and it does, but it's called character development, ok? It's still interesting to watch and Miike does have a story to tell. But the ending goes into overdrive...let's just say it's ""explosive"". In fact, I think I like Dead or Alive even more than I like Ichi the killer and Audition(I own all three). This is probably a good movie to see to get acquainted with Takashi Miike, then Ichi, then Audition, if you concentrate on just those three. Miike has directed something like sixty movies though. After seeing this, I'm definately getting Dead or Alive 2 and 3. I've heard they're all really good and I believe it, they're all directed by Takashi Miike! So, if you're in the mood to see a kick ass Asian movie with action, style and good acting, there is no way you can go wrong with this gem.",1132012800,2,1041,4.455497382198953

Although, I must say it's probably my least favorite Miike movie I've seen so far, it definately was a great movie.  It does get rather slow, but that does make you appreciate the parts that jump out at you a lot more.  Loved the ending. lol.",1126051200,,390,4.173333333333333
1865032,5,B00008WJCJ,"The film's middle, lacking the flash of the beginning and end might seem to drag a bit in comparison, but Miike populates the film with lurid details that keep it interesting. In one scene, Jojima, looking for clues, is talking to one of his underworld connections, who is busily trying to sexually excite a dog for a bestiality photo shoot. In another, Jojima grills a thug sporting a ludicrously large afro. As Miike gleefully undercuts taboos of polite society, a second theme rises to the fore - the discrimination of non-Japanese Asians living in Japan. At one point, the afro-ed thug argues that Ryuichi is a hero among all non-Japanese working in the underworld because he's willing to take all the societal alienation and estrangement and force it down the throats of the Japanese yakuza. Aside from the dizzying, genre-bending cinematic exploits, the film's sharp and intelligent dissecting of Japanese society makes Dead or Alive a truly fascinating, memorable film.",1117152000,4,976,5.10625
1865033,5,B00008WJCJ,"Takashi Miike has made a lot of movies.  ""Prolific"" does not even begin to describe the massive output of this energetic director.  Therefore, it is not surprising that his films are hit and miss.  Dead or Alive is Miike at his uninhibited best.

From the very first frame, the movie practically sparks and sizzles, threatening to jump off the screen and assault you physically.  Eventually, the film settles down to a slow, ominous burn as the conflict between the two protagonists builds to one of the most outrageous finales in the history of cinema.  I know that is a sweeping statement, but see for yourself.

Like all of Miike's best films, Dead or Alive is filled with intriguing images, powerful allegory, and extremely bizarre behavior of every sort.

Other cool Miike flicks: Vistor Q, Ichi the Killer, Audition, Fudoh, Young Thugs series.",1113264000,,849,4.929577464788732
1865034,2,B00008WJCJ,"I thought Takashi Miike was the bomb after watching AUDITION and FUDOH.  However, this effort seemed like regurgitated Tarantino and parody of his better works.  Kitano seems like a strong influence but Miike lacks the poetic filmaking style in such works as SONATINE, FIREWORKS.  Dead or Alive was a big disappointment.",1097884800,4,320,5.235294117647059
1865035,5,B00008WJCJ,"All I can say about Takashi Miike is ""Thank God!"" O.k., I can and will say more about him than that, but those two words will probably sum up your impressions of the man's film work. You groaned in abject horror over the horrific, piano wire denouement of ""Audition."" You swore off drinking milk and nearly lost your lunch over the warped portrayal of domesticity gone wrong in ""Visitor Q."" You couldn't do much of anything except sit in open-mouthed awe during the string of grotesque oddities that constituted ""Ichi the Killer."" And now you're about to embark on an intriguing exploration of the world of the Yakuza in ""Dead or Alive."" Welcome to the depraved world of Japanese auteur Takashi Miike. Anyone remotely familiar with the peculiar institution of Japanese filmmaking probably knows about this director by now. If not, you're missing out on something quite amazing. I won't say you will understand everything you see in a Miike opus; watching one of his films through western eyes is bound to cause a serious case of severe cultural dissonance. But that doesn't mean you won't have one heck of a time trying to figure it all out.

The first ten or so minutes of ""Dead or Alive"" slightly misleads the viewer. Through a series of quick cuts, pounding rock music, and extremely violent imagery Miike sets you up for a sit on the edge of your seat thriller. You've got a woman taking a nosedive out of a building, a nauseating encounter in a bathroom, a guy scarfing down bowl after bowl of noodles, exotic dancers gyrating in the background, and a gang gunning down a bunch of mobsters. What does it all mean? It's Miike's way of not just grabbing your attention, but slapping you silly until you simply MUST pay attention. It turns out that Ryuuichi (Riki Takeuchi) and his band of merry pranksters bears the responsibility for most of this violence. He's a Japanese guy born in China which, in the social hierarchy of Japan, means he's nothing. That also means he's got nothing to lose by starting a war between the Japanese Yakuza and the Chinese Triads in Yokohama as a means to take over the drug trade. Unfortunately for the gangster, the stoic and meticulous Detective Jojima (Sho Aikawa) is hot on his trail. It's a showdown between two obstinate souls that threatens to turn the streets red with blood.

Miike does an interesting thing after the initial mayhem runs its course; he slows the movie down to a snail's pace. Sandwiched between the slam-bang opening and the insane showdown at the end, ""Dead or Alive"" focuses on telling the personal stories of these two men. Miike doesn't leave us completely out to dry, of course, as he gives us plenty of disgusting weirdness to tide us over in the meantime. One of the goons in the film gets his kicks by hiring harridans to wallow in a wading pool filled with...well, watch and see. We also meet one of Jojima's informants, a man involved in filming...well, watch and see. Geez, I can't mention any of the over the top cringe elements in ""Dead or Alive""! But I can talk about Jojima and Ryuuichi. The police officer's job is his reason for being as he loves to make the streets safer for society, but his family life drifts as a result. He doesn't communicate well with his wife or his offspring. Worse, his daughter is very sick and needs an enormously expensive operation, an operation so pricey that it will force the cop to take desperate measures to save her life. As for Ryuuichi, his existence as a non-Japanese Japanese, so to speak, ensures that he will always live on the fringes of society. His relationship with a smart younger brother interested in school threatens to implode when the boy discovers what Ryuuichi does for a living.

The final scenes of ""Dead or Alive"" take the film in an entirely different direction that definitely made me smile (check out that car dropping out of the sky), but found me scratching my head in wonderment. Really, folks--you simply won't believe how the movie ends. It's so over the top that it outdoes nearly every other over the top conclusion in cinematic history. How did the conflict suddenly assume global implications? Perhaps Miike is making a statement about good versus evil? Whatever the case, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. I thought both of the primary actors (Aikawa and Takeuchi) did a fine job in what is essentially a low budget action flick. It must have been difficult to create sympathetic characters in a film featuring some of the sick stuff we see here, but Miike and his actors accomplish that very thing. Two sequels to this film arrived on the scene shortly after, neither of which I have seen yet. Based on my experiences with the first installment, the other two ought to be massively entertaining.

Surprisingly, you get more than a few extras on the ""Dead or Alive"" disc. There are the typical trailers for this film and a few others, production notes, and an interview with Miike. I liked this little discussion because we hear the director talk about the popularity of the two leads cast in the film. Apparently, Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi are quite popular in their native Japan. Miike wanted to play on that popularity with the film, not necessarily in a monetary sense (although that was definitely a consideration), but in how the two men played their roles. Takashi Miike makes anywhere from five to ten films a year, as amazing as that sounds, and ""Dead or Alive"" is one of the best ones I've seen from him. Give it a shot if you've got the stomach for it.",1097107200,24,5514,4.681443298969072
1865036,4,B00008WJCJ,"Since so much has been written about Takashi Miike, it's proven to be a bit of a challenge to view his work without any preconceived notions about it.  I actually intended to watch ""Audition"" first, but the subtitles on the DVD

I bought didn't work, so I wound up with a rented copy of ""Dead or Alive"" instead.  Anyway, so many things have been said about this guy, and his brilliant style, and his penchant for crazed spurts of violence, that I watched this whole movie on the edge of my recliner anticipating the expected carnage.  While there was plenty of blood spilled, ""Dead or Alive"" turned out to be more than the average action flick, with a lot to offer even when not rocketing ahead at the speed of a bullet.  Not only is this a great action movie, but it's also a damn fine movie, period.

The opening scene is every bit as visceral and thrilling as the reviews have said, incorporating sex, drugs, rock and roll, and of course lots and lots of nasty violence.  Once all that's out of the way, Miike gets down to the actual story, which should be pretty familiar to anyone who's watched a few American cops-and- robbers movies.  The movie largely revolves around the

exploits of a ruthless gangster named Ryuichi navigating the complex web of the Tokyo underworld, and a relentless cop, Jojima, determined to bring him down.  Both make lots of steely glares and do their share of nasty things throughout the movie, as they deal with a strange combination of professional and family problems.  It turns out Jojima needs twenty million

yen to get his daughter an operation, and Ryuichi has a brother who doesn't exactly approve of his career choice.  In other words, these guys are both compromised in their respective undertakings, and that fact weighs heavily on everything that happens.

I'll readily admit the plot can get a bit convoluted, but the movie is more notable for its downcast mood and impressive visuals.  While occasionally somewhat shallow, Miike's stylish direction helps bring life to his solemn tale of a morally compromised cop and gangster living on the edge.  Yes,

this sort of story has been told plenty of times before, but ""Dead or Alive"" still manages to elevate itself above the plain thanks to its stark characterization and mind-warping ultra-violence.  The action sequences are somewhat in the vein of John Woo's, but with more of an absurdist tone; I've never watched a John Woo scene that involved a closeup of noodles being blasted out of a guy's stomach, or a guy accidentally deep-frying his own hand, or a guy in a chicken suit being cut down by machine-gun fire.  There have been plenty of cool action set pieces shot throughout film history, but few have left me shaking my head wondering what just happened the way some of the ones here did.

It all comes to a head with the powerhouse conclusion, which epitomizes everything this movie is about: it's chaotic, it's unpredictable, and it's extremely violent.  While it's not perfect by any means, it's hard to deny that ""Dead or Alive"" is one interesting movie.  Films pitting cops against gangsters are certainly nothing new, but Miike throws in enough bizarre and surreal elements to mark himself as a director doing something different.  If (like me) you're a John Woo enthusiast looking for an alternative to watching ""The Killer"" or ""Hard Boiled"" yet again, you could do a lot worse.",1094688000,9,3393,4.772260273972603

1865040,5,B00008WJCJ,"This is an intresting question asked by Takashi Miike in the 10 min. interview included in the special features section of this disc. I believe the answer quite possibly is ..yes. But Miike needs not ask that question in regards to this movie. There are quite a few of ""those"" shots that us cinema geeks live for, (most having to do with really cool looking actors like Sho Aikawa, and Riki Takeuchi flowing towards the camera in slow motion with a group of equally tough and cool compatriots following along)because Takashi has a vision.
  An underworld on the edge of implosion, a top cop refusing to help maintain the balance between ""good and evil"" as he sets out to crush the yakuza and triad gangs. The same cop having to give into the temptation in order to save his dying child then believing he can erase it with the pull of a trigger. A Japanese gangster of Chinese origin trying to destroy both criminal factions so he can profit from a third Taiwanies faction trying to take control. Both sides loosing friends and loved ones in this vicious turf war until all that is left is....well I'm not going to give it away.
  Miike creates these very intresting characters with a minimum of exposition, and a maximum of visual interpretation. And what great characters, from the supercool,and tough(Aikawa, Takeuchi)to the twisted, and amoral they all seem to have their moments of cinematic grandure.
  The influences jump off the screen from Seijun Suzuki(Branded to Kill, Tokyo Drifter..) to Ringo Lam and John Woo, to our beloved Tarantino. Like all the great filmakers from the second half of the 20th century, and the beginning of the 21st century Miike takes,steals, and borrows. Throws it all on a canvas, swirls it mixes it and adds his secret ingrediant..the wratcheting up of the violence, the realistic blending to the absurd.
  I think he is taking his place among the best at his craft.
 DVD- Quality is crisp and sharp. Although there are not alot of extras here, what is here is good. A trailer gallery is a wonderful highlight and a great tool to search out some of the best Japan and Hong Kong have to offer.",1083715200,,2130,4.689008042895442
1865041,5,B00008WJCJ,"In modern day American cinema I feel as though big budget Hollywood is more concerned with cheesy, overpaid acting and special effects.  Though Dead or Alive has its share of special effects, the camera work and acting is a throw back to movies such as Citizen Kane.  While I would not place this movie in the same company as The Godfather or Citizen Kane, this movie does have its moments.  In my opinion, Miike knows how to make a movie the right way, with skillful cutting and effective camera work.  Even if you see this movie for its camera work alone you can appreciate it.  Though this movie has its gruesome parts, aside from a woman getting killed in her own excrement, there's nothing we haven't seen already.  Do not let this stop you from seeing this movie if you are at all interested in it.  From the music, to the camera work, to the gruesome depiction of gang war, this movie reminds me of an Asian Scarface.  Though this movie has a completely different point, if you liked Scarface, you should watch this movie.  My favorite part of this movie is how Miike was able to switch from scenes of family and reality to scenes of gore and crime effortlessly, reminding the viewer that those are just as much a part of the world we live in.  The scene in which the main character has a meal with his partner and his 5 yr old son is one that stuck out in my head due to the incredibly subtle and realistic acting and lack of cuts made by the camera.  It is simple scenes like this that has become a lost art in Hollywood.  Though this movie was superbly done, it is for a mature audience and does contain scenes of gruesome violence.  Those scenes are no worse than the brain dinner in Hannibal or the shower scene in Scarface.  Watch this movie for its fine acting and direction.",1078531200,,1789,4.381818181818182

Hysterical editings, almost unbearable scenes of torture and sexual perversions, heroes who seem to have jumped out of a comic strip are the main trademarks of the cinema of these directors.
Now are they worth the time you'll spend watching their movies ? In the case of DEAD OR ALIVE, the answer is definitively YES. The two main actors, Riki Takeuchi and Sho Aikawa, are surprisingly good and the ten first and last minutes of DEAD OR ALIVE proove that Takashi Miike is a director deserving an international recognition. Anyway, it has given me the wish to see other films of Miike.
The KINO DVD offers as extra bonus a 10 minutes interview with the director who's as crazy as his movies and a bunch of trailers of japanese movies. Sound and images average, no more.",1074124800,,863,4.7218543046357615
1865043,5,B00008WJCJ,"Whether it be necrophilia, murder, torture, incest, sex, or simply beatifully shot trolly shots of the outdoors, Takashi Miike has set the standard for japanese shock film. Though it isn't just the fact that he is responsible for over the top filmaking, he creates an atmosphere that suggest you are only watching a film by Miike. Miike can conquer any genre and make it his own. He can make question your trust on someone like he did in Audition. He can make you see the savage reality of violence like he did in Dead Or Alive. He can very well make you feel sympathetic and realize that everyone is vulnerable like Ichi in Ichi the Killer. Dead Or Alive is just another reason why Takashi Miike has the power to become the director for the new generation. Like Romero did in the 60's, 70's and 80's. Miike's film also give you a valuable lesson on life and always has message. Dead Or Alive can be summed up in a word as real. Everything you think is impossible is possible in the world of Miike. This film has amazing plot twists, beautifully  Choreographed showdowns, and a conclusion that will leave you in a state of awe. The face and representation in Japanese cinema lies with Takashi Miike, expect to see more of him in the near future.",1073692800,,1245,4.508849557522124
1865044,3,B00008WJCJ,"Dead or Alive is an extremely violent and disturbing film by Takashi Miike who also directed the challenging Audition (2000) and alarming family drama Visitor Q (2001).  In this film Miike tells a story about a gang of young reject Chinese immigrants who are ""lost"" in a foreign society.  Under the leadership of Ryuichi, the gang attempts to regain their position in society by creating their own place, which becomes a dark area in the criminal world.  In their search for belonging, they openly display their insolence for authorities and the Yakuza, since they cross paths.  This leads the gang members onto a bizarre and sadistic path.  Dead or Alive is definitely not a film for everyone; however, underneath the gross and ugly there is a distinct message in regards to society.  This message enhances the cinematic experience, but there are several cinematic infractions besides the brutality that hurt the overall cinematic experience.",1073606400,,943,5.130718954248366

It will not be entirely pleasant, it will not make very much sense, it will leave you debating the merits of vomiting, screaming, or laughing, and questioning whether any of these is a sane response to the montage of the grotesque you just witnissed.  Like a car crash, though, you can't turn away.  If pure emotional effect is what you want, if confusion and mild psychosis is your ideal net benifit from watching a film, you can't go wrong with this.

I've probably watched too many of these ""es muy macho"" Yakuza films over the last year which has made me very sensitive to the cliche's of this genre. There are two good scenes in this movie that take place in the final 10 minutes, the car bomb and the destruction of the earth but otherwise you would do better to buy a Beat Takeshi film.",1059091200,5,476,4.3
1865047,3,B00008WJCJ,"Ok, I hope you read my review first because I saw some reviews that said this movie was the best thing since receiving oral sex.  I will give you the scoop on this movie - the true scoop.
  This movie truly starts O.K. if you like wild Hong Kong action in the tradition set forth by people like (but not limited too) John Woo and Ang Lee.  I thought that this first scene would continue on until the end of the movie (which would have been fine by me had they thrown in a gratuitous sex scene to give you a breather from the action every now and then) but to my disdain it did not.  The movie slowed way down.
  Now I may have missed something in the story line that was interesting, but I don't think that was the case.  Some kind of character development does take place, but not enough for me to think that I needed to hit the pause button while I go to the bathroom (for a number 2).  I other words you won't miss much if you skip 20 minutes or so during the middle of the movie.
  The ending - don't worry I won't give it away - was an odd event.  I did feel my spine tingle in anticipation of the final action sequence.  The action portion of this finale was up there with the best of them.  You will have to re evaluate your thoughts on the movie after you see this because the ending had nothing to do with the rest of the movie.  If you thought Dusk 'til Dawn took a fast flip flop of plots this ending will leave a spinning feeling in your head for at least an hour.  Had this ending been on another movie where the plot had something to do with it, it would have been great. Even though you walk away shaking your head, you also come away with a feeling that the ending was great on some weird level - maybe the primal level where we all find violence and needless destruction interesting and a worth-while cause in life.
I am sure the followers of the movie will disagree:
This movie was an exercise in how to make a great ending suck.",1057881600,4,1947,4.070866141732283

It's got nothing but sex, insane violence and just about anything else offensive that can be contained in a movie.  Right from the get-go, the story completely takes the back seat and the movie quickly just becomes nothing but anticipation for the next out-of-this-world scene where the movie takes you somewhere that current American cinema wouldn't DARE.
...
Simply put, if you are truly looking for the movie that gives 'till it hurts, then this flick is one of the only ones out there that could satisfy that lust.  I'd never think so much insanity could be crammed on such a little disc until now.",1054512000,6,735,4.682170542635659

7987517,4,B00008WJCJ,"Well what can I say.
This guy Miike Takashi wanted to brainwash and mess our mind with this movie. There is nothing we can do about it.
The director made movies like <AUDITION><ICHI THE KILLER><13 ASSASINS> and he is keep making cheap movies. They all becomes cult films right away. Many people watche his films again and again thill they remember every shots every minutes from the film.
This film was made into sequel and so far he made part 2 and 3.
The ending was really absurd and I am sure if yo watch this film you will say What The Hell? Out Loud just like I did.
But let's just hold that for a while.

Just like his other films, there are a lot of funny violence from this film.
A guy break his own arm and take it apart from his body without even feel pain.
Stab a guy with a knife and the blood gushes out from the boby.
Bullet penetrates and that part are all ruined.
And so on.

The story is mainly about the cop and the yakuza.
The cop has a ill daughter and he needs money deserately for her treatment.
Both side are deadly to kill each other which ends up with the final brutal battle sequence which is so intense that we might feel why are they trying so hard to kill each other.

It will be explained at the end which is a huge surprise. They are, they are I cannot tell you this, you just have to figure out yourself.
The thing is this movie, the story is just came from nowhere and I don't know that I have to say it is original of it is a crap.

The thing is some of the people are relly crazy about it and the movie was made into volum 3. They are all pretty popular in JAPAN and from all over the country.

There are not so beautiful women half naked and of course violent shots that are funny at the same time.
You see there is this one scene where one yakuza is inhaling heroine. But not like any other. The heroine is scattered on this enormously wide iron board, let's say about 50 m. He inhales them all in one take. He must have dead by the end of the moment. But instead he was loaded fully.

You see that is the director!

You should watch this movie.
