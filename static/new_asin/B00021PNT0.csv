8020063,5,B00021PNT0,Our nephew loved this and it was shipped quick. We would shop here again for this sort of item in the future.,1358035200,,109,4.0
8020064,5,B00021PNT0,"There are actually 4 volumes to this set, along with a few DVD published after Fox had originally cancelled the program and Cartoon Network picked it up.  The original 4 volume set is awesome, with my favorite episode being ""Amazing Women in the Mood."" - LOL - That's comedy, right there. IMHO - The DVDs that came after the cancellation, aren't as creative and feel forced.  The characters do not feel to be true to themselves and at times feel like they are used out of character to make the story work.  I still would recommend checking them out to see the old gang from Futurama. - Aloha",1245888000,,591,4.453703703703703
8020065,5,B00021PNT0,"This is not actually a review, although I highly recommend the set (or even better, the set of Volumes 1-4).  But please note a correction to amazon's listing: the set contains all 54 episodes (13 + 19 + 22) from the first three seasons, not 43 as incorrectly stated by amazon.",1113004800,2,277,4.431372549019608

Well, whoever canceled ""Futurama"" certainly was.

I am a devout fan; I was hooked from the first epsiode and own all four seasons on DVD, among other Futurama accoutrements and kitsch. The war in my office wages as to who the top cartoon is: Simpsons, Family Guy, or Futurama. My money is on Futurama. Who can resist a show featuring an unstoppable eating machine (Nibbler,) an unidentifiable creature who claims to be an expert on humans (Dr. Zoidberg) and celebrity heads in jars, including Matt Groening himself?

Adult humor at it's best, Futurama makes many references to things that target a certain age-group. There have been times when yes, my parents have laughed and I haven't, but that in and of itself proves its appeal. Witty, entertaining and delightfully wacky, Fry, Leela, Bender and the rest of the gang are guaranteed to act out, encounter, and become the unlikely.",1109548800,,999,4.934523809523809
8020067,5,B00021PNT0,"Futurama is everything that The Simpsons was at its peak and more. It takes a bit to get into the characters and as with the Simpsons character development was a bit spotty at first, but by the middle of the 2nd season they have really hit stride.

The 1,000 years in the future setting really lets the writers and animators cut lose with their ideas. A humanoid lobster that has many different larval stages of which we get to see them all in the matter of a few seconds, cross-dressing robots, the wonders never cease.

Any fan of The Simpsons would be well served to pick up the Futurama DVDs. Like the best Simpsons episodes, many of these Futurama episodes deserve repeated viewing.",1109030400,2,687,4.5772357723577235
8020068,5,B00021PNT0,"This review is for seasons 1-4 sets.  Futurama is my second favorite cartoon.  (The Simpsons being my first.)  It is a halarious look into the future.  Matt Groening and his team have done a great job on this series.  Sadly, with only 4 seasons, it ended.  And when i was watching it, I felt that season 3 really had futurama at its top prime.  i even predicted a movie in the making. but that never happened.  however, a video game was made.  (which is very good if i may say so myself.)  I love the way that all of the Futurama episodes end.  Alot of the time, its the usual ""Simpons-all-of-a-sudden-lets-end-it-now-before-anyone-gets-the-joke"" ending.  But what surprised me were other episodes had a very sweet, little tear ending.  So, i end my review with this.  You are going to love this entire series over and over again.  Cherish them forever.  I do!!!",1096156800,9,862,4.6466666666666665
8020069,5,B00021PNT0,"futurama is a great dvd box set.

Bender and fry are funny as hell and are full of suprises throughout the whole series.  This is a real fellow buyer saying that futurama is great for kids 9 years of age and older even though it says you should be 14 or older to watch it.  this is a must have collection that you and your family will love!!!!!",1092441600,6,344,4.029411764705882
