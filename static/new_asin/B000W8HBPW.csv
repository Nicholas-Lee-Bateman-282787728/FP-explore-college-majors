I remember seeing the video box years ago and just never getting around to renting it. Now, years later, I know that i wasn't missing anything! This is pretty dreadful...I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for something suspenseful to happen...It never happened. This is a Swedish film (horribly) dubbed in English so maybe something here got missed in translation. Perhaps the intent was to present a drama or even a black comedy? Your guess is as good as mine, but I can tell you that as a ""horror film"" this was boring and lifeless. There are several fairly positive reviews out there for this film and I just don't get it....I'm apparently missing something",1487635200,,837,4.779310344827586
