8761232,2,B01FR34K1E,"Cyborgs and drones take over planet. One year later small group of humans confront small group of Cyborgs. A full explanation minus the silly plot twist comes about 13 minutes into the film.

How much you like the film depends on how you view it. As a serious sci-fi action film it left much to be desired. As a million dollar campy production, it fairs better non-sober.

The production has a lot of shooting and blood splatter, including one of the best head blown off brain splatter scenes I have seen. The film includes some silly swagger. Generic plot spoilers: Cyborgs have lots of skin showing and can die if shot, but seldom due until the director is ready for them to die. Two people (one Cyborg)  shooting at each other with machine guns twenty feet apart and no one gets hit. If you tell someone to take head shots, I would expect that person to do so also. If your body is severed at the torso, you don't have conscienceless, let alone the strength to pull yourself across the ground. The blood has drained out. Guns, swords, and electric circular saws for arms.

Danny Trejo plays  ""Captain Machine Gun"" a cartoonish  character who has brightly bleached straight teeth so he can spout off tough guy lines: ""If we die we die as one.""  The women with the best cleavage die first, leaving us with miss ""Perky..."" (Eve Mauro)
