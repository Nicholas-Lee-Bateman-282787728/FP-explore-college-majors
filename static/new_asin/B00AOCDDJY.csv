5463079,5,B00AOCDDJY,I think this is a real plus for kids of all ages.  I would definitely recommend this for to anyone wanting to introduce their children to finances.,1367366400,,147,4.444444444444445
5463080,1,B00AOCDDJY,"Are you honestly telling me Warren Buffet promotes this piece of garbage?  That he promotes it to children?  I certainly hope he doesn't, as if it's true I've lost all respect for the man!

The cartoon is boring, it tries way to hard to be politically correct and fit in with teenagers, ""OMG... I like that TOO.""  Give me a break!  And Jay-Z???  This is supposed to be the role model for the kids in the cartoon when they arrive in New York?  Seriously?!

Jay-Z is a weak, pathetic, uneducated rapper with no class and no sense of how to treat women, and THIS is the guy Warren Buffet uses to promote his videos?!  Mr., ""Bitches, Hoes and Cash...""

As the father of a 3 and 4 year old the last person on the planet I want my kids looking up to is a loser like Jay-Z!  The guy's a low life and belongs in the gutter, like his music!

Does this mean Warren Buffet has become a sell-out like Wolfgang Puck?  Shame on you Mr. Buffett.  I'm not impressed.",1366588800,11,950,4.205555555555556
5463081,5,B00AOCDDJY,"I wish this was around when I was in school. I love the quick and easy episodes that teach kids to think, rationalize, solve and put into play ideas and suggestions that will put them on the road to a good financial foundation.

We also love that each character is so very unique and instills that education and being smart isn't something to be embarrassed about but something kids should be proud of. These kids are smart and proactive. They care about their community and they make a difference.

Plus, you and your kids get a quick business tip from Warren Buffet in every episode. Watch with your kids. You just may learn something!

5463092,5,B00AOCDDJY,"I will warn that the music in this video is a bit catchy and will get stuck in your head, but overall is nicely done. The money lessons in the video are, in my opinion, basic life lessons that each child should be taught. This is a fun format for kids to learn. My 3 year old likes to watch this video. She may not understand everything yet, but she is learning from it.",1389657600,,370,4.013513513513513
5463093,4,B00AOCDDJY,"This series kept my 8 and 6-year olds reasonably entertained with stories of four kids, a robot, and their mentor Warren Buffet, who help out their school & struggling small businesses in their community. While somewhat light on traditional educational aspects, it does work in several definitions of business-terms (""marketing"", ""inventory management"") and does a solid job presenting a lot of struggles that small business owners face (a new restaurant unable to attract customers, a disorganized pet shop, local newspaper and music stores needing to adapt to the Internet, etc). Warren spouts a lot of his famous aphorisms, and the need to learn & recover from mistakes/setbacks is stressed repeatedly. To the show's credit, they resist any magical/unrealistic solutions to the dilemmas - Warren is not going to write out any checks to fix the problem.  The series isn't as amazing (entertainment or education-wise) as ""Magic School Bus"" or ""Liberty Kids"", but it's the only time I've come across something which highlights what goes on in the Main Street businesses that line our streets and employ many parents.",1389139200,3,1116,5.269662921348314

5463100,5,B00AOCDDJY,Very down to earth and educational.  I sent one to my [almost] 13 year old adroit granddaughter who is extremely goal oriented.  She wants to invest some of the money she earns from her small businesses.  Where else to start but with the wisdom of Warren Buffet?,1370995200,2,262,4.531914893617022

5463117,2,B00AOCDDJY,"Who ever put this together didn't do Warren Buffett any favors. I showed this to my grandchildren and they not only didn't like it, they didn't get anything out of it. Even I had some difficulty figuring out the ""lessons"". The concept is wonderful and it's a shame that these areas are not routinely taught in schools, but unfortunately, this product is not going to help many kinds...",1368921600,5,385,4.676470588235294
5463118,5,B00AOCDDJY,"This video allows the viewer to relate to the characters in the video. This forum facilitates a desire to master money management and the confidence to move forward with creativity in investing, saving, and earning money. My kind love it and continue to talk about the video and it's concepts days after we all watch it. Oh, and we watch it every couple weeks, too!",1368835200,,365,4.630769230769231
5463119,5,B00AOCDDJY,Bought this for my grandchildren.  I'm impressed with what we've watched so far.  They like the animation but I'm not sure if they're old enough at 5 & 6 to really get it.,1368576000,,171,4.151515151515151
5463120,3,B00AOCDDJY,UPDATE.. tried on my blu-ray and worked fine...never had a problem with any other discs...so problem solved. My problem. Should have tried that first.,1367971200,,150,5.291666666666667
5463121,4,B00AOCDDJY,"Who else is better to teach younger students how to grow up and be more financially-educated then Warren Buffet. I bought this and just received it, so I haven't watched it with my niece yet. I hope she lies the story line well enough to take in the facts and that is is easily understandable.",1367452800,,293,4.345454545454546

8555309,3,B00AOCDDJY,Expected better.,1432512000,,16,7.5
8555310,1,B00AOCDDJY,"Hard to follow.  No lessons on savings, interest, etc.  Very hard to follow.  A lot of skating boarding and hype.  Did focus on selling a product and doing the work to sell.  The stusdents hated it and it taught them absolutely nothing.  I cannot believe this DVD received such high ratings, which I reviewed prior to purchasing.  This is the worst product I've ever ordered in my life.",1426204800,,386,4.588235294117647

8555312,3,B00AOCDDJY,My 6th grader didn't like this dvd.  He said it's unrealistic.  It does not really teach the fundamentals for students that have no financial background.,1416096000,,153,5.08
