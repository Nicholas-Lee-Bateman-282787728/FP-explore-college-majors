Tammy by Debbie Reynolds is also beautifully sung by Debbie Reynolds. Hair by the Cowsills was also very nostolgic. I didn't care for this song when it was released and the Cowsills were on tv many times performing it. But I haven't seen the Cowsills perform since the 60's, so it seemed like watching old friends-great performance! Raindrops keep falling on my head was also performed well by B.J. Thomas-another great classic movie theme. To sir with love: By Lulu. I think she sang this better than the original. I don't know how to love him: Yvonne Elliman. Once again Yvonne Elliman steals the show, just as she did in Jesus Christ Superstar. She sang it beautifully, I was pleasantly surprised. There is also footage of Judy Garland singsing Somewhere over the rainbow, with Andy Williams; two belved singers singing the legendary classic! Irene Cara performs ""Flashdance...what a feeling"". Amazing upbeat performance, may be a betther performance than the original recording. You've lost that loving feeling by Bill Medley was also a great moment to have on dvd. This dvd has one beloved movie theme after another. Hard to believe they assembled all this talent to perform  some of the greatest movie themes of all time.",1295049600,3,1401,5.038793103448276

It should cost more, but that when you know your smiling. You retrieved some lost treasures - all perfect recordings song as we remember them by the artist that helped them come alive.",1284336000,2,354,4.461538461538462
