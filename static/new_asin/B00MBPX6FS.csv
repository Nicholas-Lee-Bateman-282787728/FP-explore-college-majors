8671530,5,B00MBPX6FS,"This documentary presented a good overview of the issues that arise when people have little hope, and a company comes along and offers solutions to their problems.  On one hand it is easy to side with public safety and argue the mine should stay closed.  On the other hand, (which was finally brought up at the end of the movie), the mine is the only offering on the table for employment.  The ideal solution would be employment opportunities without the dangers of reopening the mine.  I think we forget that people may not be as interested in working in the mine as they are in being employed.  I enjoyed this movie.",1482883200,,618,4.531531531531532
8671531,4,B00MBPX6FS,"Fair-minded and heartbreaking, a compelling film.  It's impossible for me to separate the film itself from the predicament of people portrayed.  I'm not unbiased--my dad worked for most of his life as a laborer in the uranium industry, and I hate it.  My Uncle Jim worked in a uranium mill in Moab and suffered a hideous death because of it.  I spent five years of my young life in Ambrosia Lake, New Mexico, now a condemned site.  My family lived for a time in Uravan, Colorado, now a Superfund Site, abandoned because of radioactivity.  I found myself talking back to the people of Nucla and Naturita.  They don't want to leave their home; they want jobs to come.  But sometimes we can't live where we want to live; sometimes we have to take charge of our fates, use our imaginations, and move on to new kinds of jobs.  A similar film could be made about many industries.  The planet is being poisoned.  When we know better, we should do better.  I appreciate that Suzan Beraza gave these people a voice--but the solution to their troubles is not as simple as they think it is.",1476489600,2,1079,4.505154639175258

Obviously this is an independent documentary film, which was shown at Sundance and other film festivals.
I thought it was anti-nuclear.no its pro-nuclear.no its antiActually, its a well-documented presentation about the conflicted views of people in a poor rural area regarding the building of a new uranium mine in the valley.  This town is a ways outside Telluride Colorado, and a mine here was used extensively in the heyday of US nuclear weapon building.  Then the mine was closed due to environmental contamination.  Then a permit was issued to a private company to resume mining, to provide fuel for nuclear electric plants.

Most of the residents were excited about the prospect because economically they were barely surviving.  They had hopes that the environmental protections and safeguards for workers would be far better than they were decades ago.  Others, with good reason, simply do not trust either the government or a for-profit corporation to put their safety first and also to tell them the truth if something went wrong.  The issue of building the plant divided the residents into bitterly warring camps
.
Then that funny thing happened: the price of oil collapsed from close to $150/barrel at its peak to around $40.00/day now.  And the Fukushima Daiichi disaster put a sudden brake on most plans worldwide to build any new nuclear energy plants (one new plant in the US was recently granted a license, the first new one in decades, if it actually goes into operation).  Suddenly the mine began to look economically uninteresting to the company and the whole project got put on hold until such time that it might be commercially viable.  Then this whole issue will re-ignite (pun intended).  And the title comes from the name of an old drive-in theatre in the town, long since closed--it really was the Uranium Drive-In.
This is a great representation of the conflicted views of average citizens, when they are forced to think about short-term economic gains versus potential long-term disasters like dying from cancer, your child getting leukemia and the like.  It is low-key and the length is only 70 minutes.  Suzan Beraza directs.  B.",1445644800,3,2199,5.044321329639889

Too much on the results rather than the solution.",1424822400,,82,4.533333333333333

I caught this on cable TV, it makes you think about the affects outsiders could have on the lives of the locals who may be willing to take a chance with their own health for the opportunity to provide for their family's welfare without leaving town.",1422921600,2,324,4.416666666666667
