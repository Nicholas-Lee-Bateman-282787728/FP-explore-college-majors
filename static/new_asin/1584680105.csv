7799450,1,1584680105,"This is some funny stuff right here. ""Creation~Science"" hahahahahaha. It doesn't even make sense. Its like researching the science of faith. Faith is not a science and will never be. Faith needs no evidence but thats what they try to show you. And its non-evidence. Its like saying ""Wow the eyeball is cool and complex, someone has to have made it."" Please do yourselves a favor and pick up a actual science book or biology book. For that matter pick up a Astronomy book and ask yourself, If the world is only 6,000 years old and the nearest star closest to the Sun is 5,000 light years away. Just for the record a light year is the distance light takes to travel a year. Then why can we see the light from objects 50,000 light years away and further. Or was that just some nitpicking things God desided weren't important in the bible. I'm sure that in some deminsion somewere carbon dating is off by a couple million years and light travels at any speed you want it to. But in reality things are quite different. We can't just dream of a world after this with flying unicorns, Big dodge trucks, and Jesus T-shirts passed out everywere. Some of us care about the world as it is today. Please stop brainwashing people!!",1259020800,2,1218,4.490990990990991

7799452,5,1584680105,"Actually I look at where you are from and then I am not suprised by your hatred.  There are many good people in NM and CA but the majority are on the fast track to hell.  Do you really think your review of this brilliant material is going to change the mind of a Christian?  If the idea of creation is such folly then why do you even bother to refute it?  Could it be that you do not like the idea that you are not your own god?  I hear a lot of theories from people like you but have yet to hear proof of anything that disproves creation.  You cannot explain where anything came from.  Every answer naturalists and evolutionists give only raises more questions.  I wouldn't be surprised if you guys didn't believe in space aliens.  For all I know you may think aliens even put us here.  I pray you quit following your vain imaginations.  Naturalism and evolution is your religion.  If it wasn't you wouldn't be offended or care about teachings about creation.  The sad thing is the more you preach against God the more you heap greater damnation to yourselves by turning those that might become believers away.  I doubt you know any of this from the Bible though.  To read the word of God would be folly to you naturalists.  You have apparantly already presumed naturalism to be true and therefore assume creation to be false.  I'm glad to be a Christian and saved from my sins and folly.

Romans 1:21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 23 And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed beasts, and creeping things.",1252800000,5,1776,4.479750778816199

And make up your own mind as to his qualifications to be writing this, or any book on the subject of ""young earth creationism"".  With nineteen grand-children being ""home schooled"", this is not the person I want authoring text books for their young minds, ignoring the obvious ancient age of the earth, universe, and clear teaching of the Word of God, which does not support a six-thousand year old universe.",1252368000,,462,4.7625
7799454,5,1584680105,"It's funny how afraid people are of the Truth. Another reviewer of this item stated that it is filled with ""an abundance of factual errors."" Then they must have been blatantly ignoring the fact that nearly every one of Dr. Hovind's statements has the full support of respected scientific experts. There are even several points during the seminars that feature video discussions by these experts on their specialized topics. Certainly, any evolutionist, biologist, chemist, geolotist, physicist, etc. WILL be speechless after watching these videos because they will have no feasible defense against Dr. Hovind's logic and factual evidence.

And just a note of courtesy: I noticed some of the rude tags left on this product by other customers and I think it's immature and disrespectful. I also think it is just a representation of how afraid Atheists are of the Truth of Christianity. If they were not afraid, would they feel the need to so rudely oppose it?  Honestly, people, let's behave like mature adults and stop the less-than-middle-school maturity level belief-bashing.",1250380800,8,1076,5.25
7799455,1,1584680105,"Not only is there an abundance of factual errors, but it seems as if ""Dr."" Hovind knows he's misrepresenting science.  Last I checked that's bearing false witness. But he doesn't seem to care. He makes a mockery of hundreds of years of science to the gullible applause of his mindless evangelical mass. I promise, if you are a biologist, chemist, physicist, geologist, etc... you will be speechless.",1239580800,6,399,4.955223880597015

7799457,5,1584680105,"These videos are the best witnessing tool I have ever seen!  Not only are they very interesting and thought provoking, but they also spread around for instance:

I gave a girl a set once a few years back.  She gave it to her parents.  Her parents shared it with their whole Sunday school.

I gave a teacher a set and he ended up sharing it with his high school classes.

I gave another guy a set and he has made hundreds of copies and has given them out.

I have seen atheists' lives drastically changed from these sets.  Not only did they become bible believing Christians, they also started sharing the sets with other people.

And the list goes on and on.",1177200000,16,658,4.327868852459017
