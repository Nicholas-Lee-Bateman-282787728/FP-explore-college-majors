4885376,4,B005SH63VU,"Th-th-th-that's NOT all, folks.  It's time for the rundown of ""The Looney Tunes Show - Season 1, Volume 3"" DVD.  The four episodes are as follows:

""The Foghorn Leghorn Story"" - Daffy becomes the lead character in Foghorn Leghorn's new movie.  Meanwhile, Bugs and Yosemite Sam discover a seemingly priceless vase.  (WARNING: This episode has a rather painful fistfight sequence.  Just sayin'.)
First Appearance: Foghorn Leghorn (Believe you me, after being seen in a music video in each of the previous volumes, it's about, ah say, it's about time that barnyard bigmouth made an episodic appearance.  First time, that is.  Also, there's the character Miss Prissy, who's credited as ""Mama Foghorn"" in this episode.)

""Eligible Bachelors"" - Bugs and Daffy auction themselves as bachelors for bidding, and they get some unexpected dates: Lola, who whisks Bugs away to Paris; and Granny, who tells Daffy her times and adventures in France during WWII whilst they clean her attic.

""Peel of Fortune"" - After discovering that Bugs is an inventor, Daffy sees this as an opportunity to make some quick cash off of a prototype design he attempts to perfect.

""Double Date"" - Daffy gets more than he bargained for when he goes out with two girls at the same time: Tina, a girl he develops a crush on, and Lola, who falls for Daffy automatically after a practice date.
First appearance: Tina Russo (She's actually a character original to the series; she works at the local copy shop and she seems to take a liking to Daffy.  To me she almost reminds me of another rarely seen character named Melissa Mallard, sort of.)

Other items within these episodes include ""Merrie Melodies"" music videos like ""Be Polite"" with Mac and Tosh Gopher plus Marvin Martian and ""Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote"" shorts such as ""Winter Blunderland"" where the Coyote makes the desert a snow-scape.

Yeah, it pains me to see this series NOT in complete season form, but whatchagonnadoo ?  Keep watching Cartoon Network for Looney Tunes both old AND new every day.",1331337600,3,2029,4.891812865497076
4885377,5,B005SH63VU,"The sitcom format may be the best thing that ever happened to the Looney Tunes, because these 2D characters have never seemed so emotionally three-dimensional. This disc concentrates on two painfully funny sitcom themes: money and dating. Bugs goes broke and loses his home in ""Peel of Fortune;"" Daffy, armed with dating advice from Lola, takes new character Tina to dinner in ""Double Date."" Both episodes have denouements that are unexpected but inevitable, as the best stories in any medium tend to have.

""Eligible Bachelors"" contrasts 21st century Paris (with Bugs and Lola) with the city under Nazi occupation, when Emma (Granny as a young woman) served as an American spy. ""The Foghorn Leghorn Story"" is slightly less interesting than the other episodes, but culminates in a devastatingly funny Antiques Roadshow parody in which all hell breaks loose. ""Silent but Deadly"" -- a parody of kung fu superhero movies -- was a pleasant surprise; not only is it the funniest of the new Roadrunner/Coyote shorts to date, it's also the first one that doesn't feel like a CGI Chuck Jones retread.

The five stars are for the shows on this disc, not for WB's parsimonious, price-gouging, no-special-features packaging.",1330992000,3,1213,5.121212121212121
4885378,3,B005SH63VU,I have to say that this show is hilarious. I have watched just about every episode and the show has steadily gotten better since it premeired. If I had one complaint its these terrible DVD sets. Both Season 1 parts 1 and 2 have only had 4 episodes each. Its the same with this DVD set. Just 4 episodes. For 13.49. Not a very good deal at all. Its disappointing that such a good show has gotten such disappionting DVD releases.,1328400000,13,426,4.271604938271605

8485096,5,B005SH63VU,"I love this show, it's not like the old cartoons but more of a updated version of a sitcom but with Looney Tunes characters.  That's the best way for me to describe it.  Bugs is the sane one, Daffy is insane, Porky is insecure, Lola is crazy, etc...  Perfect mix of humor and sitcom style stories.",1487116800,,297,4.267857142857143
