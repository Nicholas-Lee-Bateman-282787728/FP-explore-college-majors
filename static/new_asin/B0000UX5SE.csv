8003287,1,B0000UX5SE,"I saw this movie under the title ""Street Zombies"" in the previews of another Z-grade horror film.  The preview included a man shooting up drugs, and his head subsequently exploding.  I thought this movie would be so bad it would be funny.

I have never been so wrong in my entire life.  I sat through each minute of this movie, both hoping it would get better and counting down until the end.  I literally had to look at the back of the DVD box multiple times to see how close I was to the movie being over.  Unfortunately, each minute that passed was a minute wasted and a horrible minute of filmmaking.  And it kept on getting worse.  Towards the end the ""protagonist"" fathers a goblin-like child that starts speaking as soon as it exits his wife's body, and he turns into a mass of amorphous goo for no apparent reason.

I think playing ""E.T."" on the Atari would be more interesting than this, because you know once you get to the pit it is over permanently, unlike this movie.

I feel like an hour and a half of my life was wasted.  I could have spent my time doing better things, like reading a book, playing with a dog, or smelling my own flatulence.  I think the latter would be far more intellectually stimulating and interesting than this movie.",1309305600,,1254,4.404347826086957

1) ACTING: While there are no thespians of high quality here, the acting isn't all THAT bad. It's not THAT good, either, but, you know what I mean. it's pretty much hit or miss in this film. Some actors could do great in one scene and then the next scene was horrible! Which relates to the actual script itself, but I digress...

2) PRODUCTION: The lighting is bad. And what was with all the RED lighting?! The soundtrack was bad, the filming was bad...the only good thing about this one was the special effects. While now outdated, (this movie is from 1993), I have to admit the special effects department must've had a field day! It was almost as if each effect had to top the last one! Blood, gore and goo abounds!!

3) THE ZOMBIES: The zombies varied from one end of the extreme to the next. Some were the good ol' favorites we've come to love, and some seemed to be regular folk with a little bit of zombie makeup on their faces!

4)THE CAUSE: Man made street drug called Ozone.

5) NUDITY: None, not even during the childbirth scene!

Aside from the special effects, the only other good thing about this movie was the DVD cover. Which, in itself, is probably a BAD thing, since it lures you in by making it seem like it's a pretty good movie, with its plot description and pics. I think if you watched this one with a group of friends, it would be more enjoyable than if you watched it by yourself.

RATING: 1.5 out of 5",1199404800,,1474,4.318840579710145
8003289,2,B0000UX5SE,"Ozone (J. R. Bookwalter, 1993)

Recently, I've seen a good number of amateur horror flicks. The majority of them are worthless. The one thing I can say in Ozone's favor is that everyone involved was very enthusiastic about the project; sometimes that's enough to distinguish it from the pack.

Bookwalter (The Dead Next Door), who got his start as an extra in George Romero's Day of the Dead, keeps the zombies coming. In this case, they're being created by a drug called ozone (thus the movie's title). Eddie Boone (James Black of The P.J.s), a rogue detective, gets jabbed with a syringe of Ozone during a drug bust. The transformation begins, but not before Boone-- now suspended because his partner got killed in the bust-- begins an investigation into the drug's distribution, leading him to the bestial druglord Bebartolo (Bookwalter regular James L. Edwards, who recently popped up in Speed Freak Productions' The Red Skulls). The fight is on!

Now, don't get me wrong-- this is a dumb movie. The acting is flatline (when it's good), the sets are cheap, the direction is inconsistent, the lighting is awful, the soundtrack worse. The editing's pretty good. (Momma always taught me to say something nice or not say anything at all. She didn't tell me I couldn't preface nice with bad.) But, man, Bookwalter-- who also co-wrote the script-- had some great ideas here. And one gets the idea that rather than let budget constraints force the cutting of some of the movie's more memorable scenes, he stretched as thin as he could to make sure that, say, the audience got to see the arena scene. That takes guts. As a result, we get to see a surprisingly layered and complex zombie movie, albeit a badly-delivered one. Speed Freak Productions did it better with Midnight Skater, but remember this was nine years previous. Given all that, I found it rather enjoyable. Be warned, though, the budget for this movie, according to IMDB, was thirty-five hundred dollars. You get what you pay for. **",1178841600,3,1994,4.841642228739003
8003290,3,B0000UX5SE,"I am a great fan of early J. R. Bookwalter films. Movies like ""Chickboxer"" and ""Galaxy of the Dinosaurs"" illustrate what cinematic cheese is really all about. ""Ozone"" is a much more mature film, with a somewhat grander scope (and budget) than his earlier movies, and although it has better production values, I find it less fulfilling. The film is a relatively standard dark drug film, filled with evil and gross characters and special effects, which range from relatively laughable to fairly disturbing. James Black and Tom Hoover are in good form as actors here, although James L. Edwards is perhaps not quite in the same league as ""The Drug Lord.""

Generally, the film is a modestly effective horror flick, a genre that is not one of my favorites, admittedly. It isn't as scary as some big-budget horror movies, and it certainly isn't as fun as the earlier Bookwalter fare, so it left me a bit unsatisfied. I suspect that horror and gore fans will find ""Ozone"" satisfactory, and people who are fans of the film will love the packaging which features loads of extras including commentary and ""making of"" shorts.",1116547200,2,1113,4.827225130890052

8003292,1,B0000UX5SE,"I bought this one and I liked it OK, it has some nice tech aspects and is better than later JR films that are so talky I fell asleep.  but this one is still dull.  I mean, the effects impress, and the action is good when it  happens... but we get so much driving and walking and talking.  I lost  interest.  Hames Black was good in a badly written role.",955756800,,353,3.9714285714285715
8003293,5,B0000UX5SE,this video shows what can be done with a little money and a lot of  jr should be doing bigger films by now but being in the uk we are always the last to see or hear anything so if u know anything about jrs work let me  know this video should be seen by just about anyone who likes sifi or  horror and is well worth the money,933638400,,324,3.6666666666666665
