5381517,5,B00A429YOW,"picking up right where the last volume left off we continue the shadowborg arc and introduce the white blaster beetleborg who sadly doesent last past this arc as without a shadowborg there is no need for the White Blaster beetleborg, this volume continues that of the awesome nostalgia + that of Magnavores (and Flabber's) shenanigans and like i said for volume one, my only complaint is that were left off in the middle of the Metallix Arc\Saga (which is just plain evil this time around as to how they leave one hanging) i anxiously now await s2 vol 1's release in june =D",1366243200,,574,4.58252427184466

5381521,5,B00A429YOW,big bad beetleborgs!  i love this. i would get off work and make it home in time to catch the last 15 minutes of each episode. i'm glad they finally decided to release it. The last 3 episodes of the  Shadowborg  mini-series are contained here.  WOO HOO!!!!!!
