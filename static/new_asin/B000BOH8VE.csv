The scenery, storie line, actors, and tear-jerking scenes were inspiring.  A well done family movie that I am anxious to view again.",1178409600,43,259,4.354166666666667
2432549,5,B000BOH8VE,"I'm giving this film 5 stars because it is in the limited offering ""Christian"" section; but I would give it 4 stars even stacked up against secular movies with a lot more money spent on production.  This movie has everything; an unusual story, beautiful scenery, good acting, comedy, lots of action, heroism, sacrifice, character change and development, biblical values balanced by fairly realistic presentations of non-believers, a touch of racial and cultural tensions, and a clear presentation of the message of Jesus.  The Christians show flaws and failings; the non-Christians aren't stereotypes. It's family-clean and doesn't compromise to tell its story, but it tries to stay in touch with the sinful side of life as well.

The rockclimbing story is handled with high production values.  As a beginning/intermediate climber, I didn't see anything in the climbing that made me say, ""Oh, come on!""  Many scenes look authentic and provide thrills and frights.  The interaction between the two main characters is believable.

This is just a really good Christian film, even if you know nothing about climbing.  Buy it, enjoy it, use it for outreach.  It might even inspire you to learn to climb :)  (""He is my Rock and my high tower . . .)

Warning:  be careful of showing this to young kids.  It does have plenty of dangerous scenes, a fight, drinking, and a death.  Great for teens, though.",1170115200,197,1395,4.982683982683983

2432551,5,B000BOH8VE,"I loved that all the women were dressed decent. Now here's a movie that got it RIGHT!!! Good plot, showed some climbing, after all that is what is supposed to be about, right? I liked the two main characters: one black and one white man. The black man is prideful and has daddy issues. The white man is humbled and a Christian (living his life by the teachings of Jesus) man. The black man's girlfriend is also supposed to be a Christian but she has compromised Jesus' teachings and she will pay the consequences. This is how it is in real life, that is what I really loved about this movie, very believable.",1416096000,,608,4.389380530973451

2432559,5,B000BOH8VE,"This movie from Worldwide Pictures (the movie arm of the BGEA - Billy Graham Evangelistic Association) is a GREAT movie and definitely recommended! I was hesitant before even watching the film because there was another movie put out by the BGEA around the same time that I thought was a bit ""hokey"", overly predicatable, and superficial. So I was half-expecting to see similar with this film. But I am happy to report that I didn't!

This movie is exciting, loaded with great messages (but NOT in an overly preachy way!), and just generally very uplifting! Basically it's just a ""good movie"" in its own right that also has great messages and themes in it. Besides the Gospel, which is presented in a very compelling way, themes of letting go/moving on, the harmfulness of broken families, the harmfulness of sex before marriage and not taking responsibility for your actions, the importance of integrity, and more, are very prevalent. And yet, despite all the positive themes and messages, they are all (including the Gospel) presented in such an engaging and relatively ""real life"" way that they don't really come across too ""preachy"". Thus, unlike some ""Christian movies"", this one could also be a good movie to watch with unbelievers.

This movie avoided many of the traps that some other Christian movies have fallen into. For one, it avoids many of the stereotypes you might expect. Even though the two main characters are a black man and a white man, race doesn't really come up in this movie - even though there is tension between the two characters, that tension comes out of the difference in worldview, not race. That right off the bat was refreshing to see. Another thing that I found intriquing is they showed Christians as real-life people! The main Christian character was a guy who genuinely believed and was trying to put his faith into practice, but even he needed to let go and move on in his life from an event that happened in his life a few years before. They even had the unbeliever speak a positive word to him that helped him! Then there's a portrayal of a Christian who really isn't living her life as she should and makes a life-changing mistake, and another Christian that struggles a bit with unforgiveness. Again, this movie broke many of the clichs and stereotypes that you might expect from a Christian movie - especially one put out by the BGEA - but that only helps further the messages that the movie works to showcase!

Although this movie is centered around two mountain climbers, there's a fair amount of screen time that doesn't actually take place on the mountain, so it's balanced. You can very much enjoy this movie even if you're not into mountain climbing (I'm not!). The production quality and acting in the movie is reasonable enough - the acting is a bit stilted in parts, but it's not bad by any means and is generally ""believable enough"".

Now, as for children younger than about age 11 seeing this: This movie is a bit intense in parts, and without giving anything away, there is a tragedy that would be hard for younger viewers to see. In addition, the sex before marriage, anger/unforgiveness at an absentee father, and some of the other themes, really probably aren't appropriate for young children.

2432566,5,B000BOH8VE,"The Climb is a thrill ride for anyone who enjoys life in the great outdoors.
 Both the main charaters share a passion for pitting themselves against the challenges offered by one of nature's most formidable obstacles - scaling the vertical rock face of a mountain side.
 But the real test is being able to take an honest look at the direction and purpose of their own lives. One of these young men faces life with an adrenaline surging,reckless abandon that keeps him one step away from admitting a deep emptiness.
 The other knows his own limitations and finds true strength in a relationship with God.
 The interaction between these two vastly different personalities creates tensions that ultimately transform into a friendship built on lessons in personal sacrifice and the power of faith.
 This is a well produced, enriching story the whole family will enjoy.",1323734400,,864,4.972222222222222

2432568,4,B000BOH8VE,"Good production values.  Good writing.  Good acting.  Not at all preachy.  Good characterizations and character development.  The one character's ""redemption"" was well written and believable.  And it's nice to see a minority in the lead role.  I could have done though without Billy Graham's self promotion in having one character using one of Graham's books as a devotional.  (He couldn't have been reading the Bible instead?)

One thing I really appreciated about the movie is that they could have gone the route too many indie films do in having cheesy bad guys and ridiculous plots involving just how Evil the bad guys can be.  Yeah, there was a bad guy, but he wasn't over the top Evil -- that storyline was a minor plot point.

Oh.  And I enjoyed seeing Dabney Coleman, Clifton Davis, and Todd Bridges.",1305417600,4,808,4.817518248175182

The story line is excellent as the movie takes you through one man's battle with his faith and walk with Christ and the decisions he has made.  The videography is great and takes you on some very scenic trips.  It stirred the thought of how imprortant it is for us as Christians to bear one anothers burdens, walk in love and stand up for the truth.  Great family movie.",1303084800,,487,4.366666666666666

2432632,5,B000BOH8VE,"The Climb is an adventure experience you won't soon forget.  Lots of movies that have good action have inane (what I call cotton-candy - you might use the term boring) dialogue.  Others have wonderful dialogue but a dearth of action, a situation which could cause a viewer to think about having the oil changed in the car or getting a manicure before the end of the movie.  This one combined both (action and dialogue not oil change and manicure) very nicely.  The ingredient that makes a movie gripping is conflict and the tension that accompanies it.
  I will be looking for more Billy Graham movies, hoping they're as good as this.  As touched as I was by the movie, I'm not about to sign up soon to conquer Mount Everest, but I have developed an appreciation and understanding for the sport of climbing.  In actuality, I think it would be extremely cool (not to mention cold) to sit on top of a mountain and look down at everything in the distance.  In my case, I'll wait until Heaven when my acrophobia is just a distant memory.

The Climb is a Billy Graham creation.  I know many people out there have strong negative opinions about Billy Graham, but I truly think he was chosen for Christ's work.

It's about a strong, gifted, and VERY arrogant mountain climber with his eye on the most challenging mountain.  (Sorry I can't remember the name but it's either in Peru or Chile).  He is so narcissist that he thinks he can do this climb alone.  He and another climber rescue the son of a business tycoon who decides to ""reward"" them by fronting the expense for the ""ultimate climb"".

I won't go further into this, but the battle of wills begins.  These two are such opposites that it almost ruins both their dream.

This is a MUST SEE - although sometimes predictable it touches the heart.  Anyone can relate to what each climber has gone through - grief, vanity, anger, etc...",1226880000,,1106,4.639175257731959

2 solo climbers take part in a daring rescue which earns them a chance to achieve a dream - climbing Mount Chicanagua in the Chilean Andes.

2 very different characters now team up to reach their goal.

Derrick is a take-life-to-the-edge, I-love-me-who-do-do-you-love? person, while Michael takes life as it comes and has a strong relationship with God & his family.

Michael says in answer to Derrick's disgust at finding he is a Christian ""I don't preach, but I do speak my mind!"" The film is convincing, but not ""preachy"" with a strong message of sacrificial love & forgiveness.

Another Christian Film I recommend:
