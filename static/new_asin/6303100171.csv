7840136,4,6303100171,This is an outstanding adaptation of a fine short story one of our more neglected modern writers. Both Hortense Calisher and American Playhouse should be put back in circulation in print and DVD!,1402272000,,195,4.9393939393939394
7840137,4,6303100171,"Hortense Calisher's short story, ""The Hollow Boy"", adapts well to the television movie format.  Like a good short story, one can return to this video time and again, finding something new with each viewing.  The story is set in the mid-1930's in an unspecified Manhattan neighborhood.  Two boys have recently moved into the same apartment building and now live in apartments that face each other across an open entry way.

Like their apartments, the boys are mirror images of each other; the blond Werner Hauser (Alexis Arquette) works all the time and the brunette Eli Rosenblum (Marty Finkelstein) dreams all the time.  Werner is the only son of an austere German couple who spend every waking hour working and see no reason why their son should not do the same.  They have a dream of owning a restaurant, but do not spend time dreaming about it; they work.  The five Rosenblum's (Eli, his parents and two sisters) are an exuberant, demonstrative family, self-described as ""gastronomic"" Jews.  They know how to work, but they also know how to dream.  They spend their evenings listening to music on the radio, or making chamber music of their own - each of them plays an instrument except Eli who is the conductor of the family band.  The love of music is a unifying element in this story.
Conflict arises because Werner long to belong to a family group like the Rosenblums.  The Rosenblums readily accept him, indeed, they overwhelm him with their generosity and kindness, but Werner's parents constantly interfere with the relationship as it takes time away from his helping his mother with her home-based catering business.  The stronger their objections, the more Werner is drawn to the Rosenblum family circle, leading to the climactic scene of the story, a battle over music.
Underlying the Hausers objections to the Rosenblums is a latent anti-Semitism, which, although Mrs. Hauser verbalizes it only once, is present in every scene that brings the Rosenblums into contact with the elder Hausers.

The acting is very convincing, with high honors going to the Hausers, George Dickerson and Kathleen Chalfant.  Completely lacking in warmth, she is the personification of sternness and duty; he is subservient to everyone except his son whom he rules with an iron hand.  Jennie Ventris and Robert Breuler shine in their cameo roles as successful restaurant owners, cousins of Ms. Hauser.  Seeing their success in their gemtlich restaurant only makes the Hauser's rigid subservience more antiquated.  The viewer is left certain that the Hausers will not be successful in their restaurant attempts.
Most of this story was filmed in and around 788 Riverside Drive (although when Eli mentions that he used to live near the Polo Grounds which, in the 1930's would have only been a few blocks east of  788 RSD, he infers that this apartment is in another neighborhood) which is transformed with period furniture, interior decorations and colors, vintage vehicles, and, of course, clothes.  While an expert may find some anachronisms, nothing appears to be jarringly out of place.  Even in the context of a short film, the director takes time to shoot some lovely pictures, especially when the camera, along with Werner, eavesdrops on the Rosenblum's family musicales. The family grouping is so lovely, one wonders if the three Rosenblum children might not have been cast for their profiles.
Although this concise, well-balanced film only lasts sixty minutes, it is artistically very satisfying.",1007078400,6,3494,5.075174825174825
