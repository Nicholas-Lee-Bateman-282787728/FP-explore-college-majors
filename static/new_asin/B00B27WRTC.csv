5552936,3,B00B27WRTC,Very good old black and white movie. People who like semi-classic movies from the 1950 style of movie making will like this version of a post civil war era story.,1375747200,4,162,4.433333333333334
5552937,4,B00B27WRTC,"It was good to find this film finally made the move from VHS to DVD.  It has an excellent and sharp image.  It is a sentimental feature, and not always politically correct but its a good movie although it is embarrassing at times, a film made in a different era of a different era. If you can forgive its blemishes, you can enjoy the pure Ford.",1374105600,2,344,4.196969696969697

5552939,5,B00B27WRTC,How could one not enjoy this terrific work by the Great John Ford.  It is funny and warm and has moral statements to make which are demonstrated and not beaten over the viewers' heads.  In the midst of cynical self-centered intellectually stunted oprah watchers this is an island of beauty.,1373760000,5,290,4.78

5552941,4,B00B27WRTC,"Remake of ""Judge Priest"" - Stepin Fetchit reprises his role, but in this 1953 version he's toned down, has some real emotional moments. Nice to see Charles Winninger in a lead role. John Ford at his sweetest.",1370563200,4,208,4.648648648648648
5552942,4,B00B27WRTC,"Even the worst John Ford is better than most directors efforts and this is not the worst. Remake of Fords ""Judge Priest"" with Will Rodgers. Very nicely done.",1369267200,2,157,4.642857142857143
5552943,5,B00B27WRTC,"Famed director John Ford once said that ""The Sun Shines Bright"" was his favorite film, and it is not hard to see why. Basically, this is a remake of his much earlier, ""Judge Priest,"" from 1934 (starring Will Rogers). Ford critics tend to favor that earlier film version of Irvin Cobb's delightful short stories of old Kentucky, but I have always believed that this version is superior, not the least because Charles Winninger's acting is actually sharper and the dialogue crisper. Certainly, Rogers was a superb actor, but too many times his dialogue seems to trail on and on, becoming nearly unintelligible. Then, again, filmmaking in 1934 was not the same as in 1953.

Winninger was an accomplished Hollywood role player; but in ""The Sun Shines Bright"" he demonstrates that he was no simple comprimario or ""co-star."" He alternately illustrates humor, wisdom, sadness, and wistfulness.  It's a superb performance.  Despite the inevitable criticism that may come regarding this film not being ""politically correct"" (it isn't!), Ford probes human emotions and character, irrespective of race or social status. And the old Judge Priest---""trumpeter little Billy Priest""---understands fully the reality of justice, which he metes out to all, white and black, decent people and prostitutes. Certainly he does so in a social context that some present-day viewers may find foreign to ""modern"" sensibilities; but, getting beyond that stifling veneer of PC thought, and enjoying ""The Sun Shines Bright"" on its own terms can be an immensely rewarding experience.

Ford was indeed correct; it may well be one of his best films. Co-stars include John Russell, Slim Pickens, Russell Simpson, Arleen Whelan, Milburn Stone (of later ""Gunsmoke"" fame), Jane Darwell, and Steppin' Fetchit.

I have the Blu-ray version, which is superb. My thanks to Olive Films. Recommended.",1368144000,15,1857,5.302721088435374
5552944,4,B00B27WRTC,"Ford brilliantly captures the slow, leisurely pace of a small river town in early 20th century America.  A wonderful character study!",1368057600,6,133,5.333333333333333
5552945,5,B00B27WRTC,"A great quality picture and sound adds an even larger satisfaction to me.
This is for me personally the best film John Ford ever made.  I love the portrayal of Judge Priest by Charles Winninger.  All the other character actors in this film were perfectly cast.  The storyline is very human and very emotional as well on the humourous side as on the sadder side.  I've seen the film about ten times and each time it is as refreshing as it was the first time.",1367452800,13,457,4.341176470588235
8561257,5,B00B27WRTC,"Although I've not yet bought this DVD, I've just seen the shorter version of the movie via YouTube. Watching this movie was an edifying experience for this old southern boy of 80 years. Those with the liberal PC mindset need not waste their money here. They would probably not have the capacity to brush aside their obsession with social structure to see and understand the more important human relationships that this movie depicts so well. My wife most probably will not see this review, so I can admit that I shed a tear or two while watching the movie.

The setting is a town somewhere in Kentucky on the banks of a large river. Based on a comment by one of the characters in the movie, the epoch is apparently in the early 1900's, although from the movie's context one would have probably assumed an earlier epoch.

Watching this shorter version of the movie, one must concentrate in order to fill in between the lines. This is particularly true of the relationships among the pretty Lucy Lee Lake, her guardian, her estranged grandfather, and her estranged mother. It's also not clear why the young hero, Ashby Corwin, is considered to be an outcast in the beginning. The full-version DVD offered here by Olive films may enhance the understanding of these factors.

John Ford's excellent staging of the scenes, songs, and circumstances in this movie could probably not have been bested by any other director. There was a ballroom scene reminiscent of the noncommissioned-officers' ball in John Ford's ""Fort Apache"".

Here is a list of the movie's actors and their characters:

Charles Winninger as Judge William Pittman Priest
Arleen Whelan as Lucy Lee Lake
John Russell as Ashby Corwin
Stepin Fetchit as Jeff Poindexter

8561258,3,B00B27WRTC,"A Southern judge, and patriotic Confederate veteran, takes several unpopular stands against his community despite the approach of election day. This John Ford movie has weaknesses to the extent that I was going to recommend skipping it. However, watching the movie to the end, it has redeeming qualities and is worth watching. Winninger shines in this film. Be warned however: there are really objectionable racial stereotypes presented here. There are moments of weak acting, and there are plot flaws. But Ford presents a sentimental, moralistic story which prevents this from being a bad movie. Give it a try, particularly if you are a Ford completist.",1518912000,,654,5.238095238095238

8561261,5,B00B27WRTC,"OK, OK, OK...I realize that this film is well over 70 years old.  However, that's not my problem.  My issue is that this is a poor-quality print transfer.  The ONLY saving grace is Steppin' Fetchit's masterful performance which, given today's silly, knee-jerk ""PC"" standards night come across as somewhat (excuse the use of an overused word) ""racist"".  Otherwise, get this DVD and enjoy a moving piece of HGollywood History",1432598400,,423,5.086956521739131

Not intended to be ""real"",  made with a small budget and no star players, this movie and the earlier ""Wagonmaster"" exemplify the best side of the director.",1425081600,4,418,5.117647058823529

8561264,1,B00B27WRTC,"John Ford was a master director worthy of the accolades and awards that he garnered over is long and illustrious career both in the silent era and more prominently after the arrival of sound right up to his last major film 'Cheyenne Autumn' in 1964 (his last film was in 1966).  I also thought his work during WWII was exceptional as were some of his war movies but we all know Ford excelled in the Western genre and made some great films such as 'Stagecoach', 'Drums Along the Mohawk', 'My Darling Clementine', 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' and his masterpieces 'The Searchers' and 'The Man who Shot Liberty Valance''.  Along the way he also made classics like 'The Grapes of Wrath', 'They Were Expendable', 'The Quiet Man', 'Mister Roberts' and 'Gideon's Day'.  I could go on and on, you get the gist.  How does 'Sun Shine Bright' stack up?  In my opinion, poorly,

The performance by Charles Winninger as Judge Priest is excellent.  He is a man of honor with generosity and a sense of justice, the very traits that most would cherish, except it seems in the segregated South when these traits are used to assist the Blacks.  And here is the film and Ford's problem,  By 1953 the Civil Rights Movement was firmly established and had won many battles such as the desegregation of the military, education and travel (albeit legal but in practice the country was ignoring these new laws in many places).  At this time the battle for right to eat in restaurants with White people was in full swing as was the battle for the right to live where one chooses and the doctrine of 'separate but equal' was about to be dealt a body blow.  Black people by and large were embracing the idea that the time was now and that all the injustices they had faced for the last two hundred years had to be finally fought against in a final determined push.  Paul Robeson founded the American Crusade Against Lynching just five years or so before this film the need for which was absolute and complete because there were places in the USA where a black man could be lynched for just being in the wrong neighborhood, for just talking to a White woman or for trying to register to vote  Lynching usually also sometimes meant the black man's genitals were cut off and stuffed into his mouth before the body was set alight.  Yes, all this happened, many times.  By 1953, much of America was the laughing stock of the world for the manner in which it treated it's own citizens for not being white and yet railed against the likes of Communism.  The hypocrisy could not be understated.  It fought a war against the Nazi's but did exactly to the Blacks what the Nazi's did against the Jews, the Gypsys and the disabled, most ferociously so.  Yet, John Ford makes a film in 1953 where racial stereotypes are reinforced and despite the crushing adversity faced by most Blacks in the South appear to be smiling and good natured. ""Yessum"", indeed.  A previous reviewer talks of how the film tries to be fair-minded despite the stereotypes and that some of the White characters were motivated by kindness.  In light of what the reality was for most Black people, especially in the South even as late as 1953, this is hardly enough.

Mr. Ford recognized in his later years that much of his earlier portrayal of the Indians in his westerns was wrong and that America had treated them badly,... ""it's a blot on our shield; we've cheated and robbed, killed, murdered, massacred and everything else, but they kill one white man and, God, out come the troops"" (John Ford in a interview about ""Cheyenne Autumn"" taken from an article by Jack Nilan at jacknilan.com).  Perhaps his apology for the portrayals of Blacks in his pictures was ""Sergeant Rutledge"" made in 1960 which deals with the wrongful accusation of rape and murder faced by a Black soldier in the late 1880s.  If so, it was inadequate and incomplete as the truth is that if such a situation had taken place in 1880, the Black soldier would not have even made it to military court but would have been found lynched and burnt.

As much as I wanted to like Sun Shines Bright, I could not and I do not think many people who believe in genuine equality between all races and cultures could as well.",1411430400,3,4215,4.567065073041169
