2088736,5,B0002F6B4M,"This, along with Les Contes de Hoffman, is probably the hardest opera to do. It certainly is weird and this production, Kabuki style, is fantastic. Singing and backgrounds are great and the design of the title bird is outstanding. A real treat and probably unlike any other opera you have ever seen.",1095984000,17,299,4.769230769230769
2088737,5,B0002F6B4M,"'Le Coq d'Or' was Rimsky's last opera, premired as late as 1909. The story comes from Pushkin, but he'd been given the idea for the opera by a contemporary fairy-tale illustrator, I. Bilibin, whose cartoon of the Tsar Dodon - 'emperor of the whole earth' - was a satire on the expansionist longings of recent Russian Tsars; the Russo-Japanese War had just ended and the Russions had lost, to their amazement. Because of the obvious satirical political comments in the libretto, the premire was actually delayed by a few years and indeed Rimsky died before ever seeing it staged. 'The Golden Cockerel' masquerades as a fairy-tale opera, that genre so beloved by the Russians, but the audience knew what the underlying import was, even after the Tsar's censors had forced changes to soften the satire.
Be that as it may, this production can be viewed without all the political baggage as a sumptuous and fantastic fairy tale set to music. I will not recount the plot except to say that when the Tsar Dodon discovers that his sons have been killed in battle that he has sent them into he decides that 'the older ones' (meaning himself and his older general, Polkan) should henceforth 'do the fighting' and spare the loss of the younger men of the realm. (Is that a sly comment on war in general, do you suppose?) The Tsar loses a final battle to invading forces only to find that they are commanded by a woman, the Queen of Shemakha, who on her entrance sings the only well-known aria from this opera, the so-called 'Hymn to the Sun.' He becomes besotted with love for the Queen and thus begins his downfall. His realm had been protected by the warnings of the magical Golden Cockerel, given him by the Astronomer, but at the end of the opera the Cockerel turns on him and pecks him to death. The Astronomer, in the Epilogue, asks the audience not to be too alarmed by what has happened, because 'only the Queen and I are real - all the others were simply illusions.'
The music for this opera is luscious Orientalism. The Queen's entrance aria, with which most of us are familiar from its inclusion in many recitals and TV appearances by coloratura sopranos, is typical of the Eastern melismas heard throughout the piece. There are recurring leitmotifs, most of which first occur in the prlude, and some recurring harmonic devices as well, e.g. the juxtaposition of the triads of D flat major and E major.
This production is extraordinarily beautiful visually. The simple stage setting is a neutral setting for sumptuous costumes that are Kabuki-inspired and are in saturated almost Day-Glo colors. The stage direction, done by a Kabuki actor, Ennosuke Ichikawa, requires the singers (all but one of them Russian) to move in the stereotypical style familiar from Kabuki theater. They all have the heavy Kabuki mask-like make-up. (Indeed, when I first saw the Astronomer I thought he was WEARING a mask until I saw a muscle twitch!) There is a good bit of very effective dancing - Rimsky included a fair amount of ballet music in the piece - which is also in the stylized Kabuki style. All in all, then, this production comes across as something both exotic and exciting, and in my view it fits the exotic story quite well. I'm not generally a fan of changing the settings of operas, but in this case it works very well, at least partly because for Western viewers Fairy-Tale Land and Japanese Kabuki theater have much in common.
The singers are, without exception, wonderful. In particular I would single out the rich-voiced basso of Albert Schagidullin as King Dodon, and the spot-on colorature of Olga Trifonova as the proto-Turandot Queen of Shemakha. My highest praise goes to the high tenor of Barry Banks as the Astronomer. I'd love to hear/see him in Prokofiev's 'The Nose' whose protagonist has a similar almost impossibly high tessitura.
The production was filmed at a live performance at the Chtelet in Paris. The wonderful chorus was imported from the Mariinsky in St. Petersburg, and the Orchestre de Paris was led with a light hand and rhythmic flexibility by American conductor Kent Nagano.  This is a short opera - only about 1h45m - and the end came too soon.
This production of a rarely mounted opera is recommended for those wishing to broaden their operatic horizons.

2088758,4,B0002F6B4M,"Visually this is a magnificent reissue of a production that was released on DVD some while ago. Rimsky-Korsakov is justifiably famous for his exotic orchestration skills which have done so much to popularise the works of other composers, notably if somewhat controversially, Mussorgsky. As a writer of melody in his own right he was less successful although Sheherezade is an exception to this generalisation. The Golden Cockerel is a visual feast and the costumes in Kabuki style are astonishing. As music however I feel Rimsky struggled to achieve his aspirations. None of his operas have made it into the general repertoire outside Russia although this one, the Invisible City of Kitezh and Christmas Eve have some lovely music. This is pleasant music with charm and melody even if not consistently of the top order. Well worth a look but do not expect the magical flowing melody of say Mussorgsky or Tchaikovsky.",1335225600,3,916,5.072847682119205
2088759,5,B0002F6B4M,"The Chtelet's impressive staging of Rimsky-Korsakov's The Golden Cockerel, recorded here in Paris in 2002 (and hence the French title) is one that dates back to 1984, a co-production with San Francisco Opera. This recording has already been released on DVD, but it is another of those productions that are so visually splendid and memorable that it more than merits an upgrade to Blu-ray. Designed by Ennosuke Ichikawa as a Kabuki staging, it's an impressive production that fits surprisingly well in tone and content with the intentions of the original fairytale opera with a moral.

Both Rimsky-Korsakov and the librettist V. Bel'sky laid down very specific remarks about how The Golden Cockerel should be performed and it's clear that this production, even if it has a somewhat more oriental flavour, is nonetheless completely faithful to the composer's original intentions and even perhaps recognises that the opera was inspired by the conflict between Russia and Japan in 1904 at the time the opera was composed. The basic stage dressing is accordingly simple and abstract in the manner of a fable, but it is also extraordinarily beautiful with all the magic and fascination of a fairytale. If the stage then consists of little more than a brightly luminous backdrop to reflect the time of day or mood, and there is little on the stage but some steps to suggest a royal palace and stylised trees to represent the kingdom, the colourful costumes and Kabuki make-up reflect the larger-than-life characters and, to a large extent, Rimsky-Korsakov's rich romantic scoring of the work, filled with fantastical melodies and folk influences, with leitmotifs and a Scheherazade-like middle-Eastern exoticism. It's given a wonderful warm account here at the Chtelet with Kent Nagano conducting.

The space is needed on the stage moreover to contain all the extras, chorus and dancers - all beautifully costumed - and give room to the principals because this is a singer's opera (rather than say a dramatic opera or a conceptual one), with a wonderful range of voices and expression from bass declamation to soprano coloratura. Using a largely Russian cast, those roles are in good hands in this Chtelet production, with bass Albert Schagidullin as King Dodon and Olga Trifonova the Queen of Shemakha. In among all those Russians however is Barry Banks, perfectly cast for the specific demands of the high tenor role of the Astrologer. The singing is of a very high standard throughout.

This beautiful, colourful production certainly benefits from its upgrade to Blu-ray for the High Definition 16:9 widescreen image and for the sound mixes in PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 that put over the qualities of the orchestration and singing. It's really quite breathtaking. The Blu-ray is All-Region, 1080i, a BD25 disc with no extra features, although the booklet is informative and includes a synopsis. Subtitles are English, German, Italian, French, Spanish and Chinese.",1331596800,9,2972,5.1875
2088760,3,B0002F6B4M,"If this was the CD release of this opera, I'd give it five stars.  Kent Nagano, the soloists, the orchestra and chorus are super in this live performance.  But I found the ""kabuki"" staging of this opera weird, frankly.  Not only does it completely clash with Rimsky's sinewy, oriental-style music, the costumes make everyone look like overstuffed dolls and make graceful movement impossible -- hardly in keeping with the sensuousness of the score.  (Besides, Japan or Mongolia has nothing AT ALL to do with this opera ... perhaps the producer needs to bone up on his/her history to recall that it isn't Russia that traces its lineage to the Far East, but rather the Hungarians, Finns and Estonians!)

This opera could really benefit from a staged production that is true to the composer's intended style and time.",1183852800,5,813,4.905109489051095
2088761,5,B0002F6B4M,"The performances here are terrific and the music unflaggingly enchanting. In Act II the Tsar's courtship sequence is thoroughly modern and not a little risqu.

The closing tenor is unforgettable. Should be in every music-lover's collection.",1180828800,3,414,5.46875
2088762,5,B0002F6B4M,"Le Coq d'Or is not a favorite opera of mine, but I have to agree with Morrison and the chorus of other reviewers:  This is not a production to be missed!  Ichikowa's incredibly beautiful and fanciful Kabukki-style costumes, movements, and sets enhance the underlying Orientalism of the piece, its fairytale quality and most remarkably of all its biting satire of political incompetence and regal pomposity.  The soloists, chorus, and orchestra all sink their teeth deeply into the work. This tragi-comedy of the mindless worship of stupid leadership perfectly described the world of Tsar Nicholas, and is not so far from our time.",1127606400,9,630,5.1568627450980395

2088764,5,B0002F6B4M,"I want to endorse completely the lengthy reviews by Scott Morrison and Wes Clark.  This is a fantastic (in two senses of the word) opera and is beautifully staged.  Regrettably, it is performed only rarely--the only other recent major performance that I know of was at the Bregenz Festival several years ago--though a quarter of a century ago the New York City Opera used to perform it when Beverly Sills and Norman Treigle were members of the company. The Chatallet performance recorded here was originally a co-production with the San Francisco Opera, but SFO cancelled (or, I hope, postponed) it for financial reasons.  In the absence of opportunities to see Coq d'Or in person this DVD offers a wonderful alternative for those not acquainted with the story to experience a wonderful opera visually as well as musically.  I have long loved the music (on CDs), it is Rimsky Korsakov's best in my view, and it was pure delight to finally experience the whole opera via this DVD.  I cannot give it a higher recommendation.",1114214400,16,1022,4.850574712643678
2088765,4,B0002F6B4M,"In addition to two lengthy and well-informed reviews here, I would like to add my appreciation for this DVD of a rare piece of operatic repertoire.  I also have long loved the orchestral suite from this work, which is all that most people, even avid classical music collectors, know of it.  What always endeared that suite to me was not just the typical Rimsky-like Orientalism and melodic beauty, but much more subjectively, a strong sense of nostalgia, of colorful festivity tinged with sadness, a sort of ""once-upon-a-time"" atmosphere.  The ""Le Coq d'Or"" suite that I know and love has never suggested to me the biting sarcasm and satirical intent that the opera is obviously built around, despite having read about that aspect of it in the past, and in that sense it really is a startling revelation.  It's always gratifying to learn something new about an old favorite, and seeing ""Le Coq d'Or"" in its entirety is certainly an eye-opener.  I feel privileged to have to opportunity to see it.",1112054400,10,996,4.8352941176470585
2088766,5,B0002F6B4M,"To add to J. Scott Morrison's excellent review of this work... I have been a longtime admirer of Rimsky-Korsakov's score and found this DVD to be something of a revelation.

My introduction to classical music occurred when my father brought home a $3.99 LP of Le Coq d'Or at a local grocery store; I was sixteen.  (Hugo Rignold and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on Alshire, if you must know.) Why? I have no idea. He didn't especially like classical music. But, intrigued, I listened to it once, twice, thrice, began to pick up the themes and melodies, and found I actually liked that kind of music. So this work has a special significance for me.

I saw it staged in a wonderful production in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles in 1978, and have since wished to have it on videotape - now I do.

My only complaint is the minimalist settings and the kabuki style makeup and acting.  Being the only recording of this work, I would have preferred a more conventional Russian fairytale setting - the kind of thing Bilibin drew. In other words, in the style of a children's book from the early 1900's, when the work was written. Perhaps the sets could emulate the style of one of those charming Russian painted boxes...

However, having said this, I can also appreciate the artistic vision of this production. The primary value of the minimalist set and highly stylized movements and make up is to reinforce the suspicion that perhaps Dodon, the Queen and the Astrologer are archetypes of some larger tale and significance. (Surely, the Queen is a femme fatale - the scene where she taunts Dodon reminds me of Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings in ""The Blue Angel."") This is borne out in the notes in the DVD's booklet, quoting the librettist V. Bel'sky: ""...Pushkin has shrouded in mystery the relationship between his two fantastical characters: The Astrologer and the Queen. Did they hatch a plot against Dodon? Did they meet by accident, both intent on the king's downfall? The author does not tell us, and yet this is a question to be solved in order to determine the interpretation of the work."" I like to think that perhaps there are, or could be, other Astrologer/Queen stories - too bad Rimsky isn't around to score them!

The simplest and most direct interpretation, of course, is that it was Rimsky-Korsakov's criticism of his government, which makes perfect sense. Rimsky had a definite political side. His Dodon was the blockheaded Tsar, and, in retrospect, could be also viewed as an even more blockheaded Russian Socialist government.

Having seen this production, I now appreciate this work much more than I ever did listening to the orchestral suite or the opera on LPs. And, once again, the booklet helps. Prior to purchasing this DVD, I never knew that Pushkin adapted his story ""The House of the Weathercock"" from a tale by Washington Irving, ""The Alhambra."" (You can google it and find it on the web to read, and you should. The Spanish/Moorish setting is interesting.) What fascinates me is that one of the themes of the original work - comfort and safety, warning and strife - made it into the opera. Dodon snoozes, ""rules from his bed,"" and dreams of the mysterious Queen (again reinforcing a notion that she's an archetypical character). The rooster cries, and the army is dispatched. War and peace, peace and war.

Okay, okay, perhaps I'm over intellectualizing here. But I'm delighted to think that Rimsky's last opera isn't a mere childish fantasy; that it has real themes and meanings underlying the Oriental opulence of the music and staging.

Anyway, a recommended purchase. Best of all, my seventeen-year-old daughter expressed interest in it and so we recently watched it together one (unforgettable) snowy Sunday. Now it's family lore.

Long live Tsar Dodon!

8027462,4,B0002F6B4M,"I usually read many reviews from previous buyers & several critics before purchasing a DVD/Bu-ray performance. I also preview the item on youtube.com.
Jeffrey Kauffman in his review on the Blu-ray.com site states: ""Rimsky-Korsakov's not so subtly veiled political screed The Golden Cockerel, often performed in French (as it is on this Blu-ray) as Le Coq d'Or.""
Its is obvious that Mr. Kauffman NEVER VIEWED NOR LISTENED to this performance. It is clearly sung in RUSSIAN, not French. The case title of the Opera is written in French
It appears that- at least in this case- his review was ""cooked"".  I wondered how other reviews by critics are also made-up without actually experiencing the work they are supposedly reviewing.

8027465,5,B0002F6B4M,"I had just moved to NY in 1971, when I saw the City Opera production with Treigle and Sills.  At the time I missed all of the nuances of this opera, which has its origins in Pushkin channeling Washington Irving.  But most importantly is the immediate background.  Tzar Nicholas II (Dodon-Dodo, get it?) undertaking of war with Japan (Hymn to the Sun--another pun), which ended in disaster for the Russians.  It is also strangely prophetic, foreshadowing the annihilation of the Romanov dynasty.
Thus, this production, with its Kabuki style and Japanese stage directors, is MORE THAN APPROPRIATE.  I must confess I was taken aback by the stark contrast between the sumptuous production,  the music,  and the vitriol being spewed on scene by the beautiful Queen (thank God for subtitles)  Literally, it is the story of a doddering old fool being seduced and destroyed by a pitiless seductress.
However, this is also a total feast for the eye and the ear.  I adore Tchaikosky, but not his operas, which I find too ""Western"" (Eugene Onegin is, in my book, a bore).  Rimsky-Korsakov is my cup  of tea.  The cast is simply superb, and the combination of singing and ballet It is utterly seamless. It reminds me of te ""Japanese"" production of Die Frau Ohne Schatten, which is perfection itself. Kent Nagano has become one of my favorite directors..",1400198400,3,1341,4.859030837004405

Remember this is a satire, perhaps a little heavy at times, with little of the usual operatic basics of love, honor, death, etc. It was written in 1907 and denied production by the Csarist government until 1909 as it came too close to the Csarist bungling of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 which led to the Revolution of 1905. The stupid King Dodon and his advisors were surely modeled on Nicholas II and his advisors and generals. In response to some reviewers who find the Kabuki-style production not to their taste, it seems entirely appropriate given this background.
The singers are all good. The coloratura soprano handles the role with ease, as does the astrologer tenor who has reidicuously high tessitura.",1369094400,2,975,4.879518072289157
8027467,4,B0002F6B4M,"Le Coq d'Or, or the Golden Cockerel, was the last opera by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, which he completed in 1907. Based on a story by Pushkin, it tells of a foolish king who brings grief to himself and his people by incompetent prosecution of a war. The golden cockerel of the title is a magical bird that warns of impending peril for the kingdom. The bird's warning could have been for Rimsky himself, because his opera's intentional parallels with the history of the disastrous Russo-Japanese War of 1905 were too plainly evident to the Tsarist censors. Consequently the opera was not performed until after Rimsky's death in 1908, and even then only in a severely edited version.

This production is international in every sense of the word: A Russian opera performed in France by a largely Russian cast, with staging and costumes by a master of the Japanese Kabuki tradition, and music performed by the Orchestre de Paris. The orchestral suite from Le Coq d'Or is widely available and well-loved, and those already familiar with it will get added enjoyment from the opera. The singing is very well done, the music is delightful, and the fabulous and colorful costumes are resplendent.

Video quality is the only reservation I have about this presentation. Most shots are very sharp and clear, befitting a Blu-ray transcription. The narrow shots are invariably sharp, but some of the medium shots and many of the wide shots appear to have been filmed in standard definition rather than HD.  This is especially jarring in the numerous instances where a cut is made from a tight shot to a wide shot or vice-versa, and the contrast in resolution is thereby emphasized. The difference is so obvious that I am surprised it was not commented on by more reviewers. Aside from these technical anomalies the video is oftentimes startlingly beautiful.

Rimsky-Korsakov is often considered by modern critics to be second-tier among the Russian composers. He faced such criticism in his lifetime as well, with one Viennese critic saying his very name conjured up visions of ""fierce whiskers stained with vodka."" Personally, I regard Rimsky as one of my favorite composers, and therefore enjoyed seeing a long-admired piece of music brought to life as it originated, in an opera.",1361491200,5,2266,4.9867724867724865
8027468,5,B0002F6B4M,"The Golden Cockerel was Rimsky Korsakov's last opera. Its story is essentially a satire based on a Pushkin poem from 1834. His twist on this tale exposes `military incompetence, aristocratic stupidity and political corruption' (sleeve notes).

It was completed in 1907 just 3 years after the militarily weak Japanese, in order to recover Manchuria from the Russians, inflicted a number of humiliating defeats upon the Russian naval and army forces. Not surprisingly it was censored and barred from production. The composer died in 1908 without hearing the first performance in 1909 which included substantial changes imposed by the censor.

However this performance is thankfully not the censored version but the story as Rimsky Korsakov intended. In addition it has the considerable added advantage of a greatly enhanced oriental flavour as a result of the resurrection of the Kabuki staging of Ennosuke III.  This informs everything from the stunning costumes, dynamic lighting, stage actions and strikingly effective minimalist sets which produce highly concentrated impact.

None of this would work of course if the musical values were not of equal excellence. In this case the outstanding soloists supported by the insightful conducting of Kent Nagano directing the Orchestra de Paris and the chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre prove to be well up to the task.

In particular one should mention the excellence of the crucially important role of the Astrologer as performed by Barry Banks who handles the demanding tenor-altino part superbly and with apparent ease. The Golden Cockerel as performed by Yuri Maria Saenz is winningly effective.  The incompetent aristocrats and advisors make it clear why the opera ran into the censor conflict.

This is a typical Rimsky Korsakov opera with its oriental flavour, fantastical set of characters and love of extravagance. However it is atypical in so far of its biting political satire content. For me this is a favourite opera and I am delighted that it has now been produced in Blu-ray format which brings all the usual advantages of extra clarity and definition both visually and sonically.

8027470,5,B0002F6B4M,"Mr. Keris Nine has described this blu-ray release of L'Coq D'Or of Rimsky-Korsakov musically as well as its essence. I would like to add a few more noteworthy points.

1. To those who are not familiar with the beautiful orchestral suite which has been in existence for a long time, my advise would be to download this and listen to it till the melodies seep into you. The operatic experience would then be nothing short of fabulous.

2. To those who are familiar with the orchestral suite, I can assure them that they will love this production almost instantly.

3. Many have described this work as having 'oriental influences' in the music. Actually, to my ears, it is as Russian as Rimsky-Korsakov has ever been. To those familiar with Scheherazade, the texture of the music is definitely non-west-European, sets out to describe exotic places and situations, but essentially very very Russian. The base of Korsakov's music in many works lies in the rhythms and textures of the folk and traditional music of Eastern and Central Europe, which seem 'Oriental' in their approach, but harmonized and scored brilliantly in the best traditions of Classical music. Do not forget that Rimsky-Korsakov was a master at Orchestration, and most composers, especially the Eastern European ones have been influenced directly by him, and that includes Stravisky as well, who was his devoted pupil.

4. Minimalism REALLY works here. Yes, the sets border on the minimalist variety, but are made up richly by the fabulous costumes, movements and dances that have been staged.

5. Singing is flawless and I cannot think of even one character in this production who has not done justice to his/her role.

6. Bringing in the Kabuki style of staging and delivery is nothing short of Brilliant, and Nagano conducts the work beautifully. The recording is just fantastic, one of the best I have heard..., both audio as well as visual.

7. This is one of the rare cross-cultural approach to staging of works that deserve to be watched and admired. The richness of Western music and Harmony in combination with the best cultural traditions of Far Eastern staging and delivery... that too, done by experts in the field and acted out as best as possible by the cast... This IS a wholesome experience.

Please note that unlike Puccini in Butterfly as well as Turandot, Rimsky Korsakov did not bother to incorporate music of a vastly different culture to make a point. If one approaches this with even a partially open mind, one should find this blu ray just fabulous.

PS:- I have owned the DVD release of this - and was delighted with the blu-ray. Somehow, the whole work comes even more alive than it did on the DVD....

On the flip side, I wish they had a few bonuses like the 'making' of this extravaganza and/or a few interviews with those involved.

Really worth owning. It really broadens your operatic horizon (as I read elsewhere).",1337817600,5,2911,4.848790322580645
