Shot for cheap around the outskirts of Hollywood (including Bronson Canyon) in 1974, it's like Al Adamson directing Doctor Gore, frivolously topped off with a touch of Ed Wood's waning touch circa 1959. And lots of wigs. Yes, it's that good. After a small scale theatrical bow in 1976 (as Help Me...I'm Possessed), the film fell off the earth, aside from a brief vid-run courtesy Video Gems in 1984. Ten years behind in its ""explicit"" content and fifteen passed with the Patty Duke slang, this one gets it right. WAY right.

Dr. Arthur Blackwood runs a tight ship at the Blackwood Sanitarium. Balancing his ""forces of evil"" experiments while keeping the rogues gallery of helpers/inmates in check, the good Doc oversees plenty. And how! Underwear clad girls feel the bloody whip of Mr. Jittery Q. Hunchback. Random nobodies like the afro'd organ player and Zolak the sex-fiend make goofy faces. Girl fondling and torture, complete with orgasmic moans. Gummi-worm corpse ornaments. That's only the half of it. Out of nowhere, Arthur's wife shows up (?!) and a cop says ""She'd make any man happy."" Mrs. B is out to help a dense Sheriff uncover the mystery behind recent killings of ""young people."" And what of the killings? The POV monster shots tear people apart; only the flapping Twizzlers remain. If you haven't keeled over from excitement, just wait for the ending.

With sets surely cribbed from Al Adamson's Blood Of Dracula's Castle and acting that begs for mercy, The Possessed makes a bid for the greatest plotless film of all time. No more than a series of obtuse, often violent set pieces set to discordant synthesizers, Director Charles Nizet (the guy behind ultimate sleazer The Ravager) shows a surprising amount of restraint when it comes to dirtiness...which is why the film succeeds so smashingly. Instead of seeing the perversion, we get howlers like ""When I saw Mr. Zolak's head severed from his body, I felt a definite sexual thrill. I must be very careful."" Random shots disappear and float into the subconscious as the sweet monster growls (elephant? orangutang?) burst into segments. The adult themes filter through a PG-13 sensibility, washing the whole thing with frivolity. Blood and mean-spirited torment become instantly hilarious when the torturer can't keep his wig on."" - Joseph A. Ziemba, [...]",1198972800,,2440,5.052109181141439
