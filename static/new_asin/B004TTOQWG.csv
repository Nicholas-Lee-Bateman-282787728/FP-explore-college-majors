8440878,5,B004TTOQWG,"Kosovo Albanians have managed to ethnically clean Serbs out of their own land.  The census shows that in 1961 Kosovo had 65% Albanians and 23.5% Serbs.  In 2011 Kosovo had 93% Albanians and only 1.5% Serbs.  How did they manage to do this?  Raping, beating, killing and kidnapping.  This DVD shows the life of Serbs in Kosovo, the unfortunate abuse and terror.",1398643200,,360,4.741935483870968
8440879,1,B004TTOQWG,"I would, like to know how much time each of you have spent in Kosovo. For sure, the General served a tour Meaning what, twelve months? Okay, lets say more than a year. What can he know about Kosovo in that amount of time? Going by what you said on your blurb, no Serbs had any idea of what Serbs did to ethnic Albanian Kosovars before and during the war. I know that there are plenty of Serbs that are innocent. But I lived it and I was there during and before the war, as well as after. I watched the Serbs rape, burn and murder, on a level that cannot be compared to any retaliatory attacks on Serbs after the war. I know that each Kosovo Serb family had at least one, two (if not every member) serving in the Serb paramilitary. Thousands more flooded into Kosovo from Serbia.

Today Serbs live in Kosovo with no interruption. This younger generation barely remembers the war. Kosovo's economy is better than it has ever been, and Serbs and Kosovar's are working and living side by side. Is there any ethnic hatred or prejudice? Yeah, probably, somewhere But it is on a minor minor minor scale, and rare. So either your information is well outdated, or you are living in a fantasy. You want facts Live for five years in Kosova. Then, and only then will you truly know what it's like to live there.",1393113600,2,1299,4.345679012345679

It is in a format produced for European DVD players, and as shipped from Serbia!  It does not work on my JVC DVD player.",1376352000,2,293,4.12280701754386

As this DVD shows, there are obviously tragic unresolved problems in Kosovo regarding the dispossessed and the ethnic differences.

On the other hand, one can't dismiss out of hand, for example, hopeful reporting from Michael J. Totten (Internet-based), in his
August 4, 2008 dispatch ""An Israeli in Kosovo.""

Quite informative and thoughtful are the expert Canadian perspectives regarding heavy-handed and dubious U.S. political machinations before, during, and after their Balkan interventions.  These can be found in the 45+ minutes of ""extras"" (interviews and speeches) on the DVD.
