892672,5,6304493703,"This DVD is superb.  Luciano Pavarotti is at his best, and so are the other tenors. I have enjoyed watching it several times and never get tired of it.  Wonderful to hear all the tenors at their best.",1171584000,,200,4.2368421052631575
892673,4,6304493703,"This 1990 soccer World Cup concert, which launched the Three Tenors phenomenon, has a beautiful open air setting at the Caracalla Baths in Rome.  This means however, a loss of acoustics.  Orchestral sounds that would be enriched by a little reverberation literally drift away on the evening breeze.  But the singing is excellent.  They sing 4 solos each, then - after a sinfonia, or orchestral interlude - 3 more as a trio; 16 tracks in all.  All three singers are perfectly at ease in the Romance languages, but struggle with German and English, sometimes quite badly.  In the worst example, 'Maria' from West Side Story, Pavarotti bellows, ""Say it soft and it's almost like praying"".  Well, we'll have to take his word for it.

Despite these imperfections, the DVD remains a joyous celebration of some very fine singing and is well worth a look and a listen.

If you are yet to experience a Three Tenors concert, you might prefer to start with the 1994 Dodgers Stadium performance, when the soccer championship came to the US.  That has more songs and is a slicker, more professional affair.  It also has a celebrity audience, including Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, who are honored during the concert.",1143849600,11,1204,4.824390243902439
892674,5,6304493703,Please see my review on the CD recording of this work. Everything I say there applies to this dvd. Buy it! It is a landmark in music history as well as one of the most enjoyable things you will ever watch!,1138579200,5,205,4.024390243902439
892675,5,6304493703,"You simply cannot go wrong with this one. I enjoyed this concert

immensely. The 3 Tenors all sing magnificently and they are at their best! Beautiful songs, beautiful surroundings. I highly recommend this DVD.",1136246400,2,210,5.176470588235294
892676,4,6304493703,"One of the great facets of this performance is Domingo's rendition of the No Puede Ser...from the Zarzuela genre which is too seldom performed.

You'll probably notice a loss of control of Carreras' voice- know that he was undergoing a full course ofChemotherapy during the time of this DVD's taping. That fact that he could get through the concert is a testament unto his abilities. The Lamento di Federico is one of the most poignant renditions i've ever heard...even better than the Jussi Bjoerling version.

I think the medley including ""Maria"" and ""Memory"" is a little corny, but I suppose if you want to hear an operatic and over-sung version of those songs, who better to hear sing them than the Three Tenors.

That was a long winded version of ""it's a great DVD, buy it.""",1130284800,,779,4.713235294117647
892677,5,6304493703,"After watching the concert for the first time I'm actually speechless. I have the cd from this concert and I love it, but the dvd is a hundred times better. No wonder it's the world no. 1 classical bestseller. All the tenors are in resplendent voice, but to me Jos Carreras is the star of this night. Hearing (and seeing) his rendition of  ""Il lamento di Federico"" and ""L'improvviso"" will leave you gobsmacked. His stage presence is like always both humble and charming. Adding to his charm is the way he behaves in ""Lamento di Federico"" after having produced some notes of pure delight. He instantly lifts his eyes to heaven, smiling, looking around as if he expects to see someone up there who helped him getting through the difficult parts of the aria. Then he blows a kiss of thank you to heaven, obviously grateful, before he continues singing.

Although I'm not the biggest fan of Pavarotti or Domingo I have to admit that Pav's  ""Torna a Surriento"" and ""Rondine al nido""  and Domingo's ""No puede ser"" was absolutely beautiful. The reason for not being their biggest fan is that they're not able to stir my emotions like Carreras, but when performing together the three voices blend perfectly and it sounds just wonderful.

I loved the way the three of them enjoyed themselves when performing together. It's real fun to watch the encore ""O sole mio"" where Pavarotti gives his famous trill. He just shakes his head and the high notes pops out. I've been listening to this on the cd for a long time, but never before seen what really happened. Pavarotti starts singing and then Domingo surprises him by cutting in, taking over the singing. When it's Pavarotti's turn to sing again it seems he's thinking (humorously) ""I'll teach him not to interfere with my singing again"" and then he push his ""high-note-button"" and he's holding the note ""forever"".  When he's busy doing this, you can see the two other ""conspiring"", looking like two young boys who are really ""up to something"". And when Pavarotti allows them to take over again they leave him flabbergasted by throwing themselves into the song, copying his stunt perfectly, making it sound all the way as impressive as his. The look on Pavarotti's face is priceless. He's laughing out loud in astonishment. It's obvious he wasn't expecting any competition....

I also have to comment on the conductor, Zubin Mehta. He really impressed me with his conducting, being so attentive to the singers. He's watching them closely all the time and making the orchestra follow them just perfectly. He's giving a hundred percent throughout the concert. And you can also see him being impressed by the tenors performances, acknowledging this by putting down his baton and applauding. At one point he also gets down and hugs Carreras after his wonderful rendition of ""Granada"".  So he's definitely not a stiff and unapproachable conductor.

This dvd is a real treat. If possible I would have given it more than 5 stars. Buy it, and I promise you'll spend many hours in the company of the three tenors..... Enjoy!",1119225600,13,3054,4.812977099236641
892678,5,6304493703,"Without all the glitz and sparkle,  before the hype!  This is the greatest classical concert ever!  As a tenor myself I couldn't be more thrilled to hear this gem.  The three voices were marvelous.
  Domingo here is in top voice.  Some of his singing in this concert is the finest you will ever hear from him.  He is in a dark and excitingly dramatic voice!  Her give perhaps the best Pue De Ser Ever!  At 50 his voice is as glorious as ever.  he is in a great mood all night giving all of his sound and heart unconditionally to each song, to me he lead this concert along with his emotion packed performances that never seemed to diminish.
  i have mixed feelings about Carreras.  He is my favorite tenor of all time, but this is not the time to see him.  It almost makes you cry to see what has happened to his glorious voice in this concert.  His singing is fine, but hardly under control.  His vibrato can get warbly and his eyebrow doubly so.  This doesn't keep his from being number one in my heart.  he gives passionalte renditoins of songs pouring everything his diminsihed voice had in it into each aria.  This is one of the last times you can hear him sing some of his classics like Improviso.  E la Solita storia and Improviso are both the highlights of his night, he will bring you to tears with these long Aria's.  He loses control of his voice at the end of Improviso but te fact that he even sang it is impressive, it is my favorite.  Carreras will please the listeners ear here but promise if you hear this concert that you will also invest in some of his earlier material before his voice grew dark and overweight.  I suggest The golden Years Cd which recently came out which shows him in his prime doing all of his classics.
  Pavarotti is in good voice all night.  Vocally he dominates concert with his amazing bush button high notes despite being, by far, the oldest.  Recondita armonia is not my favorite aria in his voice, but it is okay,  too lyric in my opinion.  Torna sorriento  is a highlight of thee dvd!  Sure to please!  As always, he brings a fabulous interpretation of Nessun Dorma to the table.  To me he gives a less empassioned performance than domingo, but you cant argue with his voice and charm.
  The medley was a real treat!  The highlight for me was Amapola where the trio gives carreras the drivers seat for a change and he thrills with a dramatic B flat that you won't hear from the other two.
  the encores were delightfully spontaneous with the famous trill from Pav in O sole mio.
  This is the opera lovers version of the three tenors.  For someone who is new to classical music i always suggest the 94 concert as it is more flashy and pop oriented.  This concert, however,showcases the tenors in their best voices giving the most operatically driven and spontaneaous performance.",1047859200,177,2827,4.428849902534113
892679,5,6304493703,"This DVD looks and sounds wonderful and how could it not with three of the worlds greatest tenors. Who would have thought this concept would work, but it did and does; the blending of the three; one low, one in the middle and one high is excellent-The voices perfectly match.

I would have liked more combined - all three singing together - but the several individual selections easily stand on their own. There are a number of combined performances as well.

The reason I give this a 3 is that the tech quality is really showing its age. It was shot in video and looks it. Also, the packaging was flimsy and there was very little information included. So bottom line: The recipient of the gift loved the music and video but  I thought it could be so much more and at the price I sort of expected it to have a bit more content considering the cost.

If you are a fan of the 3 Tenors, you won't be disappointed in terms of what is performed though. It is a great concert",1368230400,2,750,3.947019867549669

In addition the setting is hard to beat for a sense of history--the baths at Caracalla, in Rome.
The photography is also very good, with frequent sweeping views of the immense audience that was present.  The tenors of course have aged with time--Pavarotti is no longer with us, Placido Domingo has moved on to occasional conducting, and Carerras I do not know about.  Their format has since been copied many times by other trios, but this recording of the first performance of its type in the form of classical opera remains as the exemplar.",1336435200,,699,4.620967741935484

In O Sole Mio for example, Carreras and Domingo (and not surprisingly the audience) react strongly as Pavarotti holds his crescendo.  Since it was their first time singing all together, their voices are at a peak compared to later performances.  Both classical and popular songs are included so there is something for everyone.

893419,4,6304493703,"Glancing at the Amazon review above, I thought for a moment that I had the wrong item--but the thumbnail is right: the other reviews are right.

I understand why purists are--at the very least--ambivalent about projects like this.  It's at least as much show-biz as art.  But then again, one of the first things they teach you about Opera in music appreciation class is that it was originally  a popular art form, and if three of the greatest tenors of the latter 20th century could help re-popularize the genre once more, well, it's all to the good, right?

Well, maybe, maybe not.  The Three Tenors were a brand name while they lasted and mygosh all those spin-offs: 3 Irish Tenors, 2 Mo' Tenors, 3 Terrors (yes, they existed!), to say nothing of the soprano ensembles.  You're almost tempted to say they created a monster.

But there were just so many good moments.  Of course, Pavarotti's ""Nessun Dorma"" has justifiably become a popular classic, but Domingo's ""No Puede Ser"" and Carreras' ""Granada"" are almost as memorable.  And when the three join forces on a reprise of ""Nessun Dorma,"" well, you forget the gimmicky nature of it all and just enjoy three beautiful voices blending beautifully.

Carreras' begins the program with ""Lamento di Federico,"" and he's just shaky enough that you wonder if his return to performing after having beaten leukemia wasn't perhaps a bit premature.  But he gets progressively stronger and more assured as the evening wears on.  You come to share in his sense of triumph.

I remember at the time that this concert was first broadcast on PBS, a co-worker of mine--an otherwise tough-talking dame in her 60s--declared herself to be a ""Domingo gal.""  And you can see why.  His easy going masculinity and dashing looks clearly make him the hearthrob of the program.  His voice has always struck me as being deeper and richer than most tenors, and I'm not surprised that he is taking on baritone roles in his later career.  Of the ""Three Tenors,"" he's really the only one who could likely pull off such a move.

His much vaunted ambition and adventureness is evident even in this limited a program.  He tackles pieces in German, French and English with a bit more ease than Carreras (while Pavarotti only seldom ventures from standard Italian repertoire).

In some ways though, the two Spaniards seem almost deferential to Pavarotti, the sole Italian and therefore (at least by some definitions) more of the heir to the operatic tradition.  He was, in some ways, the most imperious, while being somewhat indifferent, it seemed, to his personal appearance.  It may seem petty to wonder why he didn't bother to trim his beard, but it did appear almost defiantly unkempt.  Nothing ragged about his vocals here, however.  It's hard to imagine a more gorgeous instrument.

Newcomers to the world of opera could watch this broadcast in 1991 and experience firsthand how distinctive these singers were, what each could bring to a given piece--be it an operatic aria or a Neapolitan (or Spanish) song.  They could also experience the emotion and the HUMOR that was characteristic of great singers' concerts.  All in all, a good intro to the genre.  And a brilliant commercial move--not that there's anything wrong with that.",1238457600,,3250,4.890310786106033

Alone, any of the three is a wonder to behold, but together, they are at the top of their game. In this, the first of several world-reknown concerts, they amaze the audience with their wonderful voices, and entertain by playing off of each other on songs like ""O Sole Mio"". Opera purists apparently think this was nothing more than a cash cow for the performers, but there is a reason that, to this day, this concert's accompanying album is still listed in the Guiness Book of Records as the best-selling classical album of all time. Other concerts may have had more glitz and glamour, but the first showcases the Three Tenors at their best, both together and individually. Once you hear Nessun Dorma, done by either Pavarotti by himself or by all three, you will understand why it is one of the most-beloved arias of all time, and was made popular as a theme for World Cup soccer (and more recently used by Paul Potts to win Britain's Got Talent). Overall, this is, by far, one of the greatest classical shows you will ever see or hear, and is just as wonderful to enjoy now as it was nearly 2 decades ago.",1235520000,,1232,4.655963302752293

893484,5,6304493703,"The Original Three Tenors Concert was held during a very warm month: July.  The actual date was July 7, 1990 at Terme di Caracalla in Rome, Italy, to commemorate the World Cup Football finals.  The location was spectacular: the fabled Roman ruins of the Baths of Caracalla.  The idea for this concert was for colleagues Domingo and Pavarotti to welcome back Carreras after his successful battle with leukemia and to assist his foundation.

Zubin Mehta was the conductor of two wonderful orchestras that night:  The Rome Theater Orchestra and the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino.  Over 12 million copies of this classical best seller have been sold and it may still hold the Guinness World Record for the best selling album.

 Jos Carreras, Plcido Domingo, and Luciano Pavarotti absolutely inspired over 6,000 enthusiastic spectators and another 800 million watched it on television on that warm July night.  The audio and visuals are good considering that this was done 18 years ago.  There are absolutely no extras at all on this DVD; it is the wonderful operatic singing of three legends and their performance on this special night which is not to be missed.  Much has been said about the performances that followed; but this one was very, very special.

One minor authoring glitch is that the viewer will also find at the end of the concert that the DVD does not automatically return to the beginning of the concert and menu.

When Carreras hit his B flat in Amapola one knew he had distinguished himself from his peers; Domingo was powerful and impassioned throughout; but Pavarotti when he sang Torna A Surriento and Nessun Dorma thrilled me personally; but it was O Sole Mio  which touched my core and my ancestral roots.

Get the original; it was simply not only the first; but the best.  This DVD will have no frills, no extras, no interviews; just god like vocals.

Highly Recommended

In my case, I was pottering around at home, blissfully unaware of anything, when my Dad phoned me and said ""Turn on your TV - three guys are singing beautifully."" I did, and the rest is history.

I'm a professional musician and can't pull out bits or say where people were better than others. Pavarotti was aureate and majestic, his great bulk filling the space, singing with his entire face....Jose Carreras wonderfully intense and sensitive, like the younger brother, keen to impress and seeking approval (later bravely to fight his own health battles)....and Domingo was mischievous and competitive.

Zubin Mehta held the whole event together brilliantly, part authoritative, part conspiratorial. In the magical setting of Caracalla, the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.
