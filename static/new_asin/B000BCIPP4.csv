8085161,5,B000BCIPP4,"The Unlearning Homophobia series is a treasure of powerful personal stories told by LGBT people and their family members to help people understand what it means to be gay, bisexual, lesbian, and/or transgender. Each of these films are exceptional on their own addressing issues of sexual orientation with regard to religion, race, and ethnicity. Together they are an inspirational, unique resource that is a must for all teachers of human sexuality and any educator working to bring compassion and understanding to LGBT people.
