8562221,5,B0012KSDG0,"I must share that following Tara Lee's yoga regime every day during my pregnancy helped me immensely to have a comfy pregnancy and a smooth natural birth with no need for any pain relieving support. This prep course is amazing for you to instinctly know how to handle your contractions and to understand your body better to manage the pain (breathing exercises, all-fours exercises etc.). I also felt energised after each session (I practiced yoga every day during pregnancy, and dedicated my yoga only to Tara's regime during my third trimester), which helped me to have an easy and comfortable pregnancy without back pain or general muscle pains experienced by most pregnant women. Thank you very much Tara Lee, I definitely tribute my wonderful pregnancy experience to you!",1416528000,,776,5.0703125

8562223,5,B0012KSDG0,"This is my first ever review!! But I absolutely loved Tara's pregnancy yoga DVD and wanted to make sure others know about it too. I lived in the UK during my pregnancy (the price there is much more reasonable) and bought this in my first trimester. I used it through my whole pregnancy and I loved. The exercises are supportive and well-explained, the music is soothing and wonderful (I miss the music and consider putting the DVD on just to hear it now even though my baby is 8 months) and there is a constant body, mind, soul, baby link. It supported my during the pregnancy and helped me prepare for the birth.  I often didn't have time to do the full workout and just did different sections each morning. Some exercise videos can be really annoying, but Tara manages to create this to perfection.",1390953600,2,800,4.517241379310345
8562224,5,B0012KSDG0,"my friend from england is a labor coach and pregnancy fitness instructor, she suggested this dvd to me. i was on bed rest most of my pregnancy so i wasn't able to do this every day but for the few months that i was able to sit, stand and walk, i really enjoyed this dvd. it re-energizes and strengthens while it has a very relaxing effect. i truly recommend it.",1344988800,,361,4.171428571428572
