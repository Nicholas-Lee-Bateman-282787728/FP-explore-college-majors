1635070,5,B00005NKC7,"OK, I'm not really big on independent films and only saw this one because Brian Littrell, AJ McLean, and Leighanne Wallace Littrell were in it. But OLIVE JUICE is actually a great film - the best independent (and only, I guess) film I've ever seen, and I am not just saying that because I am a huge Backstreet Boys fan. I read all the reviews on this film and I think the reason why most reviewers said Leighanne couldn't act was because they were jealous she married Brian. But she really can act - don't listen to those bitter-jealous BSB fans! The film has got a good solid plot and cute story. The filmmaking was done very well. The acting by the entire cast was superb. I give this film an A+, ***** (5) stars, and two thumbs way up. You shouldn't just see OLIVE JUICE because Brian and AJ are in it (they only have small parts and if you don't watch closely enough, you may miss them!). If you are into independent films or if you are a crazy, obsessed BSB fan who must own everything that's related to the BSB, then I totally recommend OLIVE JUICE!",1004572800,,1055,4.306532663316583

1635072,2,B00005NKC7,"I found Tyk,Brian Littrell and Aj Mlcean to be the only reason to watch this sorry ... movie. It's very lame. Leighanne wallace is the worst up and coming actress I have seen in a long time. She needs to take some leasons. It's sad the promo team behind this ""movie"" have to have ""AJ MCLEAN AND BRIAN LITTRELL"" in big letters on the cover of the movie to get people to see it. What a waste of time and money for AJ and Brian. Two thumbs down. However Aj and Brian did great in the 10 seconds they are in the flim.",1003708800,,513,3.9902912621359223
1635073,4,B00005NKC7,"Wonderful performance by Leighanne Littrell.  Although, the film did not do her talents any justice.  There are too many unnecessary scenes.  It could've been better.",1003017600,,166,5.56
7947396,5,B00005NKC7,"My wife loves this movie. She also loves the Backstreet boys, so it's a plus to see Brian and A in the film.",1410825600,,108,3.739130434782609
7947397,4,B00005NKC7,This movie is just a nice funny romantic comedy and a great surprise if you love the backstreet boys.  I love this movie because it makes you think Enjoy!,1259971200,,154,4.310344827586207
7947398,3,B00005NKC7,"So this movie came out in 01 a year after Leighanne Wallace became Leighanne Littrell, it was a big deal in the world of Backstreet fans, and I had bought the movie years after the BSB mania died down. I only saw Leighanne in a small part in Wild America and was curious to see if she was any good...well she is. This movie is so adorable, it's cute and innocent something for everyone to watch. And what's even more cute is her and Brian's dog Tyke. Okay first let me start off by saying she plays a fiancee that visits Orlando because her mother is sick, a pet store owner sees her and falls for her, she doesn't know it but her fiancee is cheating on her as well (how could you cheat on someone like her is beyond me), but anyways he becomes really good friends with her and falls even more in love with her, she dumps her fiancee and more like he drives away and leaves her behind and she gets with the pet store owner. It's not the ""Titanic"" or anything great but it's a nice light-hearted movie when you feel like watching something sweet on a bad day or a good day. Brian was in the movie as well as A.J. it didn't show any acting skills but who cares the movie is adorable. If Leighanne didn't have her son, I think she would've done more acting, but at least we have this movie and Megalodon to enjoy her work, I think she would've done well with being in more movies and honing her acting skills but who knows maybe one day she'll pick it up again.",1232841600,,1458,4.15547703180212
7947399,5,B00005NKC7,"for an independant film, this was great!  i loved the movie as soon as i started watching it.  DJ Dan is fantastic!
i do think they over publicised brian littrell and aj mclean's appearances in the film, but it was still a great movie.  lil' tyke was my favorite.  he was so cute!
leighanne is a great actress.  she is beautiful and can act.  she really got into her role and i really liked that.
it is a really great movie and i recommend it to everyone!",1024790400,5,455,4.172413793103448
7947400,1,B00005NKC7,"Last Saturday, me and my b/f were bored. So, we decided to rent
some videos, 'cause his mom was away and his dad was
at work. Anyway, we went to the rental place nearest
his house. We got some movies. One of the movies we got was Olive Juice. I'm ashamed to admit this,
but part of the reason we got OJ was my b/f, I know I
worried about this too, thought the girl on the cover was
cute. Speaking of the cover, I felt so bad for James
Berlou, the only real actor, he got like 1/16 of the
cover if that. When we got back to his home we decided
to see OJ first. First off, my b/f kept asking where
did the chick from the box go. I told him 'michelle',
Leighnne's part, was the girl. He kept asked how her nose
got so big. He looked digusted everytime he saw her
profile. Also, he kept saying she had a ton of wrinkles.
God, she looked like 43 in this movie. His dad came home early. His dad came in around half way through the movie. He kept
asking who the actors were, because he knew they weren't
famous. The part he came in on was the part were the
black doctor brought a watermelon to the funeral. My
God, I thought he was gonna [potty] his pants laughing.
In his own words, ""Ok, it's SUPPOSE to be a funeral.
Which usually is a sad thing, and they decide to have a
black man come in carrying a watermelon. Besides,
that's racist."" I really don't see how it's racist, but
I do agree it's funny. Funerals aren't suppose to
be funny. Speaking of death, when Leigh's character
finds out her mom died she couldn't even cry. No tears.
Not even a sniffle. She just layed in the mom's bed
and closed her eyes and like shaked while the black
doctor, same guy who brought the watermelon to the
funeral, looked at her like 'WTF?'. Then, they show this
black dj, I forgot his name, peeing in someone's
backyard and riding a bike like he's a retard. I hope some
idoit actually does something like that and sues the
idoits who put out OJ. The end scene they stop
Michelle's moving van, which she's driving, and her and
Kneeler, James Berlou's character, makeout on the back of
the van. Then, Kneeler talks while the screen goes
black. God, this movie [stunk].",1023840000,2,2148,4.190821256038648
7947401,1,B00005NKC7,"This movie was slow, predictable and quite frankly stupid.  It had good intentions, but didn't pull them off very well.  It totally trades on lead actress Leighann Littrell's famous Backstreet Boy husband, Brian and fellow Backstreet Boy, A.J. McClean (both of whom appear in the movie).  I can see why it never made it to the theaters.",1023580800,,336,4.859649122807017
7947402,4,B00005NKC7,"I had vision's been a bit bored when i was gonna watch this, but i was really surprised with how good and sweet Leigh Anne Littrell was. I had heard some bad reviews from other people, but it was a sweet romantic comedy that really touched the heart. Yes, i am a BSB fan, but you really don't have to be to watch this. She's an inspiring actress, and i hope that she'll be in more movie's really soon!!!",1020902400,,403,4.113924050632911
7947403,5,B00005NKC7,"This movie was great for an independant film.  Good muci in it.  The actors were funny and very realistic and believable.  Of course highlights were seeing AJ as DJ Nasty and Brian asa the Carriage driver ""in training"".  But also Leighanne was great for her first role.  I felt she was both believable and entertaining. I laughed, I cried and I loved it. Also note worthy is the cameo by Leighanne and Brian's dog Tyke, he sees more screen time then AJ or Bri!",1011571200,,460,4.428571428571429
7947404,3,B00005NKC7,"I rented the movie last night, and I have to say that it wasn't all that bad.  I thought the plot was pretty cute and James Berlau was even cuter!  Leighanne didn't do such a bad job either.  I think with a little more practice she could be a really good actress.  She was very believeable in some of the scenes, but in some others, I just couldn't get into the scene because she felt fake.  DJ Dan was hysterical!  That guy made me laugh every time he was on screen.  I, too, was disappointed in how they marketed this movie by using Brian and AJ.  Collectively, they are shown on screen for about 3 minutes in an hour and a half long movie.  It's far from classy to splash them across the box in neon writing just because they are famous.  It will be the only reason most people rent this movie, but I don't think it's a fair reason.  The movie stands as pretty damn good for an indie on it's own.",1009929600,,899,4.109195402298851
