its not english and german DTS HD

Dolby Digital TruHD  & DTS-HD Master Audio are BOTH lossless audio tracks.  but just stating a mere fact for you, theres no german, instead its a music only track

5408521,1,B00AB2H3SE,"The disc I received does not appear to be damaged, but the quality is VERY poor.  Throughout the program, the image is fine for ~5 seconds, then blurs badly for a few seconds. When the picture was clear, the effects were good, but the constant blurring (or just poor 3D imaging) was really annoying.  The audio is poor, and gets louder and softer every few minutes.  I don't think it's defective, just poorly produced.

The film is also surprisingly boring; it shows the same shots over and over, and a few times when they showed a really attractive fish, they didn't say one word about it!

Some of the other reviewers had similar experiences, while others claimed they loved it (could they have been watching a different film?).  This was the most disappointing 3D film I've ever seen, but Kudos to Amazon.com for their great customer service.",1366070400,5,845,4.714285714285714

5408523,1,B00AB2H3SE,"I believe the above reviewers may have seen a different  dvd from that delivered to me. Papua itself is poorly represented several views of the mushroom islands and the same black cockatoo about 5 times, and what is this ""dancing with the natives"" referred to? There were no natives on this dvd...only some giggly school chidren (shown twice) and the majority of the film was of the coral reefs, not PAPUA! As to the gentleman who viewed it 3 times and could not find the duplicated fish shots,,,view it again  because they are there,,in spades,,with only a change in the boring commentary..this is a real loser of a 3d as at times the screens do not jibe giving a cross eyed experience to the viewer,,,caveat emptor..there are better coral reef films out there..the only good thing is the price..cheap but still not worth the money.",1365984000,9,833,4.7379310344827585
5408524,5,B00AB2H3SE,"I would have to disagree with the 3-star review above that mentions bland, washed-out colors. I believe the problem is with his TV and not with the film. Papua 3D was absolutely gorgeous! He was also incorrect about the score, which was above-average, and the comment about seeing the same fish was just ridiculous. I watched it three times to try and find this reappearing fish he/she mentions, all to no avail. Don't believe the three-star review. This was an exceptional documentary, well filmed, well narrated, and most of all, with extraordinary 3D-effects. The AQ was quite good, as well.

If you like this sort of thing, you will be quite impressed with Papua 3D!",1365897600,3,670,4.826086956521739
5408525,3,B00AB2H3SE,"I bought this expecting Finding Nemo-esque visuals, but instead almost fell asleep during the movie.  The coloring was strangely bland and washed out looking, and the narration and score were uninspiring.  More than once it appeared that footage from earlier in the film got reused, and on more than one occasion, the same fish (literally the same fish!) was on display.  It seems as though the movie was shot in a single day, and that the footage was shuffled around somewhat to make it appear as though it was taken over a longer period of time, which seemed cheesy to some extent.  The 3-D effects were quite good however.  They delivered a nice sense of depth and volume, but the insipid presentation, I hate to say, bored me and rendered the effect somewhat irrelevant.  3 stars overall I'd say is fair.",1362009600,13,808,4.695035460992908

5408546,1,B00AB2H3SE,"This film is a joke. Most of it is about marine life like corals, clown  fish, etc. supposedly shot in Papua.

5408552,1,B00AB2H3SE,"What an absolute waste of time, effort and money, mine and theirs. I was expecting a documentary of the people with some colourful costumes, tribal dancing and great scenery. This has no story, no logical flow, no decent imagery, centres around one tiny village off the coast of eastern Papua somewhere and rarely shows any people. It repeats countless boring minutes (seems like hours) of tropical underwater footage shot around one small area of pretty boring coral reef. This has to be the worst purchase I have ever made of anything, it's even worse than my first car, which blew up after 3 days.",1373932800,7,600,4.778846153846154
5408553,2,B00AB2H3SE,"This video has nothing to do with cannibals.  Although there are some descent images of sea life, there is really nothing but undersea footage.

5408554,1,B00AB2H3SE,"This DVD is simply not worth buying or watching at any price. The writing and narration is equally as poor as the video and editing quality. Lots of low quality shots, 3D gimmicks and even repeated scenes due to poor editing. Other than being in 3D this film is like watching a low end home movie.",1372464000,6,297,4.321428571428571

5408558,2,B00AB2H3SE,"Each reviewers regarding the content is subjective, so I will avoid that and focus on the video quality. The 3D effect is good BUT the video quality is poor; just like a regular DVD quality. In fact, I have seen some DVD with video quality better than this Blu-Ray title. Nothing on the front or back insert that says 'high definition video' but there is a logo for DTS-HD (high definition AUDIO). Disappointing video quality.

Because, I do respect nature and animals, I rate with 3 stars but in terms of the film itself and narration, let me tell you that is not very professional. It is a Little bit boring, the 3d efects are good, may be not super high quality but it is ok. If you watch other films like imax you can see the difference in terms of production.  I guess the director tried hard to present a decent film, but it is lack of a story, it nees may be more action, or some detailes that other films contained.",1369267200,,577,3.9741379310344827

5408561,5,B00AB2H3SE,"Stunning Pictures, and I have over 55 Ocean related Blu Rays. Not quite on the level of Coral Sea Dreaming, but for the price, these photographers have done exceptionally well. Different species of fish than most, and has a unique look at times.  I have rated products for years, many years in the video category.  Dollar wise, this is a bargain,  in both 2D and 3D the film is Great. Like I said, not the very top one, but if you are a fan of sealife, you'll enjoy. Another positive is Surprising Musical background. Can be set to just play music too. I tweaked my color settings up a notch, and am enjoying this, for 3rd time today, just recieved.

5408563,2,B00AB2H3SE,A very poor 3d production.  The director didn't really know how to use 3d cameras effectively.  Really an anti-climatic production.,1368403200,,131,5.5
5408564,1,B00AB2H3SE,"3D quality is low. Zero wow factor. The are many times the same loop is played over again with a different voice over. More than half of the show is underwater simply with fish swimming around. A lot is still picture. This is not National Geo quality by any means.

I didn't finish it 100% and simply threw it in the trash. I couldn't even use it to show off my 3D. I cancelled my Yellowstone Park 3D  purchase which hadn't shipped yet since it appeared to be coming form the same source.",1368057600,11,488,4.236559139784946
5408565,1,B00AB2H3SE,"Out of the 50 minutes run time, same video parts were repeating multiple times. The narrator is annoying. 3D quality is too bad. The closeup scenes with 3D cannot be watched clearly and I ended up watching it in 2D.  I do not recommend anyone to buy this.",1367798400,3,255,4.3125
5408566,3,B00AB2H3SE,"During my Navy career we actually pulled into Papua New Guinea and it was one of the most engaging and fascinating places I've ever been: so when this came out, I got it to show my family what all I had been talking about.

Well, about the only footage of the island itself is a couple of birds of paradise, a handful of other critters, a folk band and some school kids. The rest of the DVD is the coral reef. Over and over and over. In fact, the SAME reef footage is played over and over and over... it got to be a joke for us: Oh, there's that same fish AGAIN!

Not to mention the fact that apparently the camera operator underwater had the 3D camera on autofocus or something, causing a really unsettling re-focusing every few seconds.

Like ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams"", this DVD would have been great had it been a little shorter. But it seems like the producers were pressured to fill in time, so they repeated footage ad nauseum. This would have been a great 45-minute DVD about Papua's coral reef... but something this long, with as little island as there is, came as a great disappointment to us, Caveat Emptor.",1367798400,,1118,4.391304347826087
5408567,1,B00AB2H3SE,"Hmm... where to start? 3D it is. About Papua it is NOT.
Putting aside the 3D technology, where some credit must be given, this production is nothing short of fraudulent.
Papua - the secret islands of the cannibals... forget that discussion. Diversification of wildlife, cultures, vegetation, etc... forget that discussion. What you will get is about 90% of underwater film, which is beautiful, but NOT what this DVD is marketed to be about. Moreover, the narration (no doubt the script) sounds like it came out of the 1960s or 1970s. At times, the statements are just contradictory to the visual evidence. As the narrator explains about the people being untouched by modern society, we see kids wearing western-style uniforms, churches made of concrete, etc. Often, the narrator is still explaining a fish or coral when the visual has moved on to something else (except for extended shots of the manta and cuttlefish). This points to the editing; sub standard, at best. Scenes are obviously repeated, cutting between fish is too rapid never allowing the viewer to take in the beauty of the species (except for manta and cuttlefish, although, even then, when the rare all black manta is identified the visual is spliced away to some other fish). I could continue, but shall not for brevity.
In summary, if you want to watch a relaxing non intelligent tourist-dive-boat or travel-shop-type production of a reef, then this is the DVD for you. If you want to watch something about Papua (be that West Papua, Papua or Papua New Guinea) this is NOT the DVD to buy.
Seriously, the makers of this production should be held accountable for their deception - unless I only have been given 1 part of 10 possible episodes about Papua.
(Oh, OK, a declaration: I grew up in PNG so maybe my expectations were more than a put-me-to-sleep 3D promo of a reef).
I hope their other productions are better as I have ordered a few... oh, dear.",1367452800,36,1921,4.806646525679758

5408569,2,B00AB2H3SE,"Very disappointed. This is nothing more than a video of someone's vacation, which in of itself wouldn't be bad if properly done. Too many repeat shots, over and over and over.  Nothing about the real Papua, pretty much just the resort where the videographers stayed.  The 3D effects were not all that spectacular either!  Not a good buy!",1367020800,,337,4.775862068965517
5408570,5,B00AB2H3SE,"I love this, a place so magical and difficult to travel to, laid out before you in stunning 3-D with an excellent narration. It is hard to imagine the beauty of coral reefs in this part of the world, and I was so taken in that it felt like being in a private submarine. The island adventure is captured both above and below the waves in a manner that deserves a second volume. Truly great family entertainment that will be enjoyed for years to come. By the way ,there are no cannibals in this movie, so don't let that get in the way of a great purchase.",1366588800,2,553,4.177570093457944
5408571,2,B00AB2H3SE,"I was thinking from the title that this 3D movie will contain more of the island scenes, including the animals, birds, and people. I was disappointed when the movie switched from above ground scenes to basically all under water as there are plenty of good 3D movies that contain aquatic life under the sea such as ""under the sea."" Out of the 55 minute run, good 45 minutes is filmed under water & only about 10 minutes of content covers the island, caves, some birds etc. So if you think that you are going to see cannibals, birds, exotic animals, and other island related content, don't waste your money on this film. Also, the marine life content is somewhat repetitious as the filming is around the same fish species.

It would have been ideal to include more of what the island offer than fish types around the island.",1366588800,,822,4.554054054054054

5408573,2,B00AB2H3SE,"This is a short movie shot of the ecology of the coral reefs surrounding Papua.  While it is pretty, it is more glossy than informative and apart from seeing perhaps three minutes of some Indonesian Christian Papuans singing guitar gospel on the beach - it has no evidence of any other human life on this equatorial paradise.  It did occur to me that perhaps the cameramen were eaten by the cannibals leaving the producers scrambling to deliver a 3-D movie based upon a solitary deep sea underwater cameraman - who banked on the weak swimming abilities of the indigenous natives.",1366502400,2,579,4.78

Pros:
Nice under water footage with tons of wild sea fish and corals
Good 3D effects
Good background audio quality although the Bass is annoying some times
Great paradise location
The movie has a setting that you can turn off the annoying narrator
Less than $10 delivered with no tax. Not bad

Cons;
Not a quite 1080p footage
Very annoying and dull narrator with a foreign accent that puts you to sleep, so turn it off at the setting.
Some of the 3d images are pretty bad on the left eye as it seems like the camera lens was dirty or foggy when recorded
Some of the images are too saturated and poor visuals
Too long video so it is difficult to keep you awake
The under water images are usually repeated over and over, same fish, same corals, etc.
More than 3/4 of the footage is underwater and a little talk about Papua nor their people culture, etc.
only fish and corals, not eels, dolphins, whales, octopus, etc. some manta rays and one turtle.

I will put this video on sale at ebay, I hope to get $5.00 for it.",1366329600,9,1057,4.301507537688442
