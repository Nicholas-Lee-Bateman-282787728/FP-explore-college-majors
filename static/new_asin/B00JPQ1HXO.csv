6388579,5,B00JPQ1HXO,"For fans of ""Bewitched"" who couldn't afford the individual box sets when they came out originally Sony/Millcreek Entertainment have come up with a marvelous idea: Millcreek has purchased the distribution rights to many Sony TC shows and has decided to release the season sets, like those of ""Bewitched"" at a fantastic price. When I first bought these set they ranged any where between $40.00-$60.00. Now in this wonderful set you get both Season 3 and 4 together at a remarkable price!

 Like the original box sets there are NO special features (which is true of the entire set of ""Bewitched-The Complete Series"").

 Sit back and go back in time when ""Bewitched"" first went to color in the fall of 1966 and watch all 66 episodes that were broadcast from 1966-1968 in the entirety!

 ""Bewitched"" finished in the Top 10 (coming in at #7 on the Nielsen Ratings) for the 1966-1967 season at came in at #11 in the fourth season.",1398038400,8,923,4.7375

6388581,5,B00JPQ1HXO,"I love bewitched. I love watching Gladys freak out and Abner just wave her off. I love watching Aunt Clara muddle things up. She just wants to help and her heart is in the right place. I find Darren annoying sometimes. I feel as if he should have accepted facts. Tabitha is absolutely adorable. Some of these episodes are really out there. Aunt Clara looking up Ben Franklin, and Leonardo da Vinci,  Christmas carol inspired story line, a visit back to the first Thanksgiving. I haven't got to the point where this show is getting old and I don't think I will.",1479859200,,560,4.490196078431373

6388593,4,B00JPQ1HXO,"The third and fourth seasons of this hit sixties sitcom starring Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha Stephens. She is married to a mortal Darrin Stephens (still Dick York) and lives in an unidentified New York City suburb. Her mother is played to perfection by the incomparable Agnes Moorehead (one of America's great actresses) as Endora. Guest stars include the unforgettable Marion Lorne as Aunt Clara (She won an Emmy posthumously) from the fourth season. Sandra Gould replaced the late Alice Pearce (she also won an Emmy after she passed away) as Gladys Kravitz. Gould doesn't miss a beat and makes the transition effortlessly. Dick York is absent from a few episodes in the fourth season.

Despite the cast changes, you would think the series was cursed by then. Alice Pearce (first Gladys Kravitz) and Marion Lorne (Aunt Clara) both passed away during the series. They certainly deserved their Emmys for Supporting Actress in a Comedy even posthumously as a fitting tribute to their performances in this landmark sitcom series. Elizabeth Montgomery appears in every episode and carries the series as well. She also does double duty as cousin Serena. She deserved an Emmy for Best Actress in a Comedy. Darrin is felt absent especially in the fourth season. Dick York leaves the series for health reasons and is replaced by Dick Sargent.

There are plenty of wonderful guest stars and supporting performers like David White's Mr. Tate; Kasey Rogers' Louise Tate; Mabel Albertson's Mrs. Stephens; Hermione Baddeley as nanny Elspeth; Peggy Pope; Sandra Gould's Gladys Kravitz; and so many more guest stars to name a few. The arrival of Erin Murphy as Tabitha Stephens is superb casting. She did a terrific believable role as the young female witch.

If you loved the series in the first two seasons, third and fourth seasons will equally entertain you as well. This DVD set features 66 episodes with 33 per season and 6 discs. There are no extra features sadly. Bewitched became equally popular in syndication after the series ended its run. Still, it's a joy to watch the series.",1449532800,3,2080,5.005780346820809

6388605,5,B00JPQ1HXO,"Bewitched is one of those wonderful TV-Shows whose entertaining qualities seem to challenge the passage of time. This series is as funny and entertaining today as it was when it first came out on television.
I recommend Bewitched and by the way, all the seasons 1 to 8 have something good, funny and entertaining to offer.
My favourite seasons are the first five seasons, however seasons 6 is also wonderful, 7 is a bit weak but passable, 8 does a good promenade on the memory lanes of past episodes, ergo ending the series in a beautiful noteworthy season.
If the Different, the Untried, Magick and Witches, are your favourite things, you will love Bewitched.

Received the package and was dismayed to discover that the outer case was broken at the top of the spine with a piece or 2 that came off in my hand upon opening.  I returned it for a refund and re-ordered.  The replacement was cracked on the bottom left corner but not so much so that pieces were falling out like in the first shipment.  I decided to keep it since the discs were not damaged in any way.  If it weren't for that, I would have given 5 stars.  I only mention this to provide warning that you may receive a damaged or cracked case.",1504742400,,722,4.151079136690647
