6598819,4,B00MP2FJNY,"The Jean- Claude Van Damme Triple Feature are Cyborg - Death Warrant and Double Impact with a clear picture recorded on Dolby Stereo with no special feautures o Subtitles  just three Blu Ray movies I have seen when first realeased on video and enjoyed two out of three , didn't thing much of Cyborg more of a B Grade movie with some good action fighting sequences than again for the price can't  complain worth buying .",1465171200,2,419,4.5
6598820,5,B00MP2FJNY,Great collection of some of Van Damme's best work!  Picture quality was outstanding.,1464825600,,84,5.461538461538462
6598841,3,B00MP2FJNY,A nice collection or movies; not Van Damme's best; but CYBORG is a classic and Double Impact is dated but still watchable.,1464566400,,122,4.590909090909091
6598842,5,B00MP2FJNY,Huge Van Damme fan great quality and good movies,1462233600,,48,4.444444444444445
6598843,5,B00MP2FJNY,I absolutely love this set of movies! Van Damme is one of the most awesome actors for movies and does well in every one that he has been in that I have seen in my opinion. I would definitely refer people to watch these movies!!,1456963200,2,227,4.066666666666666
6598844,5,B00MP2FJNY,"If you are a fan of Van Damme then you will love this set. The picture quality is light years above the DVD releases. The special features are non-existent unfortunately, but that does not detract from what a bargain this set is. I love all three of these movies and I highly recommend this buy.",1453161600,2,295,4.381818181818182

6598848,3,B00MP2FJNY,"MGM are doing the same thing Warner bros is doing
recycling their individual blu-ray versions to help the customer save money i guess
in this new MGM 3 DISC blu-ray set you have 3 Van Damme classics Cyborg, Death warrant & Double inpact
these 3 films are exactly the same as the individual blu-ray versions, the only difference is the packaging
there's no new special features, infact there are none except for the Theatrical trailer for each film
the sound quality is exactly the same, which is standard Master audio stereo mix, no 5.1 mixes unfortunatley
the 1:85:1 HD transfers for all 3 films are very Good picture quality,
but not excellent they're better quality than the old dvd versions anyway
all 3 Discs are on Disc trays in 1 case
so instead of buying all 3 films seperatly at $9 each blu-ray, you pay $9 for all 3 films in 1 blu-ray case
pretty Good bargain
each film deserves about 3-4stars, this new blu-ray package is 3 stars in total- 1 star each Disc
cause as i said there's no special features, the sound quality is the same master audio stereo mix",1437091200,14,1066,4.528497409326425

8673737,3,B00MP2FJNY,Picture quality is decent with this transfer to BD.  Sound quality is average.  These three films aren't JCVD's best but are entertaining enough for fans.  Good value overall.,1512086400,,175,5.178571428571429
8673738,5,B00MP2FJNY,"I wanted to see Cyborg.  I seen that as a kid and remembered it being pretty good.  It's very entertaining but now I see the major flaws in it.  Still enjoy it though.

The others?  Well I tried to make it through on and will finish it.  It's a typical 80's, early 90's film that isn't well throughout with scripts that have serious plot holes or events that just simply don't happen but for the sake of the plot you just ignore them.",1508716800,,434,4.168674698795181
