7993156,4,B00009V8UY,"This is a spoof on Bollywood and turns out to be very funny and very entertaining. Every stereotype on India--or so it seems--is pulled out for this film. A washed up, but intelligent, American actor gets a chance at a role that's off in India. He's shocked by what he finds and proceeds to upset their apple cart during shooting. But then, he comes out of the encounter having gained as much as the Indian cast and crew. It's really worth seeing. For those Americans with experience in India it will mean even more. Om Puri enhances it all with some really good acting. The dialogue is peppered with South-Asianisms like ""Thanks you!""  This film will leave you laughing and uplifted.",1407542400,,684,4.652892561983471
