8654616,4,B00JYR10T0,I love Highlander and all of its forms it was fun seeing the how this was not the same are the US movie was it has a few parts that are very not the same. That was the fun in watching this film for me other then this I have to say poor copy of the film get the US one it looks better this is in English and the sound is fine its just a bit grainy. This is an Imported film it is the German version of the film its is different and that that makes it fun to watch. Its still the same movie for the most part its a lot of fun for fans to spot the changes in the versions of the films. I plan on getting all the cuts of the films before I can't get them. I am a Huge Highlander fan ;) this was a gift my wonderful husband got me for my birthday. Many fans get all the different versions of the films if you're a big fan you might like this if its your first time seeing Highlander 3 get the USA version don't get this one.,1441584000,,919,3.6700507614213196
8654617,3,B00JYR10T0,"Nothing marvelous about this blu-ray edition. Picture quality as expected for an upconverted version on bluray. The movie itself waa a strange attempt to milk a sequel out of the original highlander, and was essentially the same story with a different cast. No improvement in special effect. Better than highlander 2:the quickening and all that ""Zeist"" stuff, but a sequel that really wasn't needed. Again, bluray nothing special, dvd is adequate enough as no real difference in quality",1439942400,,486,5.243589743589744

8654619,3,B00JYR10T0,"I brought this since I'm a huge Highlander fan and this was the only way to get this on Blu-Ray. I must say I'm a little disappointed in this, it has no menu, it just plays the trailer and then the movie. The video quality appears to play at 1080p and has good audio. It has subtitles in english for foreign parts only. They really need to release a US Blu-Ray version.",1432684800,2,369,4.138888888888889
