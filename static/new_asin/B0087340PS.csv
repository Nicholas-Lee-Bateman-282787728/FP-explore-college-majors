8628700,5,B0087340PS,"Fantastic product although I expected just that, having known Linda Tellington-Jones since 1979. What Linda touches turns to gold - in the hands of the beholder. The method she teaches is the kindest, most spiritual way I know to handle or train not just horses but any animal. We are looking at trust and understanding and willing co-operation as opposed to submitting, dominating or forcing an animal. I have used the basic method in training my own horses as a novice with great success for years. Now I am a bit rusty and out of it so this DVD is helping me to get in touch again with a safe and highly effective way to create a win win situation with starting a young horse.
