8223525,5,B00003ETM9,"What's not to like?  The story is good, a refreshing break from the Disney formula plot.  The animation and music are high quality.  This film passes the kids test; my 2 and 4 year olds watch the whole thing, and keep asking to see it again.",995068800,,241,4.195652173913044
8223526,4,B00003ETM9,"excellent film done in old style. most of the kids i saw watching it were glued to the TV screen. mostly for kids, but older people can enjoy it as well. commercial or not- it's watchable unlike many other things.",994809600,,213,4.35
8223527,5,B00003ETM9,"I saw this movie with my four little daughters, and they loved it. This adventure is so funny, the animation so well done, it's probably better than Feivel... Especially the music is great! You just have to watch it  with your kids, I'm sure they'll love it too.",960163200,2,262,4.458333333333333
8223528,5,B00003ETM9,"The croatian mouse is the new hero for kids. It's really a lovely classical story, done in a fine animation. Also the music is great, I wonder if you can get it on a CD or something like this.",960163200,,192,3.948717948717949
