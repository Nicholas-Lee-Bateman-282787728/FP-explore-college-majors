2322156,5,B0009UVCN0,"Unfortunately, I didn't get in on the Liberace craze when he was performing in Las Vegas.  I was a very young teenager and I heard only blue-haired women saw his shows.  Oh! The lies!!  This movie proved I missed one of the greatest and grandest performers ever.  The elegance and elaborated performances took my breath away.  I would have fainted from the exuberance beauty if I had been present!!
My senses were in overdrive just watching clips on the DVD.  The movie was very well done and a (hopefully) honest look into Liberace's life. I'm looking for actual footage of his shows, so if anyone can help, please contact me!!",1260144000,11,628,4.663636363636364
2322157,5,B0009UVCN0,"A movie made in Canada the year after Liberace's death; I bought it because years ago I had seen a movie on TV on the same subject, and I thought this was the one; it was not, however it is really great (I would be embarrassed to say how many times I have watched this film since I got it two weeks ago) It shows Liberace's early adult life as he becomes famous.  Victor Garber (from Titanic) is just great in the lead, and is so believable; the voice, the mannerisms, he even looks like him; and his manager played by Saul Rubinek is wonderful too.  The music is a treat, the acting good, the story entertaining. Last but not least, the movie handles Liberace's  personal life in a very sensitive way.  Would recommend it highly for Liberace fans, and it only cost something like $2, so go buy it--what do you have to lose???  It is out of print so it may not be available for long.",1259971200,11,883,4.232142857142857
2322158,3,B0009UVCN0,"I remember watching this movie in the mid nineties. I decided to purchase it to give it another go.  The movie was ok.  I think it could have foretold much more about the life of Liberace, i.e, his struggles as a gay man and the last days of life after being diagnosed with AIDS.  Overall its worth the watch.",1213920000,,309,4.203389830508475
2322159,4,B0009UVCN0,"This 1988 TV-movie dramatizes the life of Liberace, who rose from a ""shabby"" background to become a world-class pianist and a human monument to glamour. In other hands this could have been a shrill, sensationalized biography, dwelling on smirking innuendos  and tawdry episodes, with Liberace presented as a flamboyant, shallow caricature. Thankfully both the script and the performances are sympathetic, and viewers can sense just how sensitive and troubled Liberace was.

Victor Garber turns in a stellar performance as Liberace. The actor obviously studied Liberace's speech patterns. body language, and pianistics, and the results are dazzling: he not only looks and sounds like Liberace, he even sings like him. The film commendably traces Liberace's rise to fame and re-creates milestones in his career (including a careful facsimile of his 1950s TV show).

Unfortunately the action is sometimes choppy, with sudden stops and abrupt transitions. Several of the plot elements and characters are established without introduction or identification, and just as suddenly abandoned. What should be a finished portrait comes across as a hasty sketch. It's hard to tell if this is the screenwriter failing to develop certain situations, or the film editor being forced to cram a 50-year span into an hour and a half. Either way, the momentum of the story is frequently blunted, but Garber's riveting turn helps cover the rough spots.

Maureen Stapleton is excellent as Liberace's possessive mother, as is Saul Rubinek as his longtime manager Seymour Heller (who is credited as a technical advisor). Macha Grenon's presence is welcome as one of the young Liberace's few friends, but she is hastily written out (or edited out) as the film forges ahead.

Picture and sound quality are very good overall (there are two tiny digital glitches in the video transfer, causing momentary silences). The DVD also includes a trailer (actually an extended TV promo, using many representative clips).

Watch this one for Victor Garber. He's most of the show.",1208131200,33,2043,5.309597523219814
2322160,5,B0009UVCN0,"Actor Victor Garber portrays the legendary child prodigy Liberace, who became one of the world's greatest entertainers, while embracing a lifestyle of flamboyant excess. Liberace was a gifted classical pianist, fueled by poverty, at the age of 17 Liberace was already playing with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, but he wanted more. Through a combination of showmanship, determination and amazing talent he acheived his dream as the world's highest paid performer. Liberace had an amazing ability of combining together the popular tunes of the day with classical music always improvising on the spot live in front of a huge audience giving requests of songs for him to play. Liberace was always trying to get people to love and respect classical music as much as he did. But behind the diamonds and wealth Liberace became a prisoner of his elaborate double life. His desperate attempts to keep his gay private life and that he was dying of AIDS secret backfired in a series of scandals and front page news lawsuits. This was a very moving, sensitive movie and I've enjoyed watching it many times. Liberace was truly the greatest entertainer of all time. He had it all, humor, charisma and out of this world talent. There will never be anyone else like that. He was one of a kind. If you've watched any of Liberace's shows you know he always ended every show with playing and singing the song, ""I'll be Seeing You"". I found it very fitting that's how the movie ends with Liberace playing the piano and singing the lyrics:

I'll be seeing you
In all the old, familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces
All day through.
I'll be seeing you
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you.",1186963200,19,1719,4.73
2322161,5,B0009UVCN0,I saw this TV movie back in the 80's and loved it! I've been hoping it would be released on DVD. I'm so glad it has been made available! This is a keeper.,1138320000,20,154,3.696969696969697
2322162,4,B0009UVCN0,"This is the TV bio-pic produced in the late 80's starring Victor Garber and Maureen Stapleton. It has only previously been available on VHS in limited availability in some countries, this is its first appearance on DVD. As tv movies go it isn't too bad and the leading man gives a fairly good portrayal of Liberace. A fairly accurate bio-pic, I liked it a lot.",1126310400,24,360,4.553846153846154

2322167,5,B0009UVCN0,"An intriguing biopic;  I ordered it after reading a New Yorker magazine article on Liberace. I knew nothing about him other than as a flamboyant guy who played the pianoi was incredulous that michael douglas would take on this role.  the dapper douglas jettisoned all ego as the embodiment of one of the icons of our time.  And the glorious Matt Damon - of the Bourne Conspiracy films - he,too, played against type here - another unlikely but excellent choice.  These two actors who could have rested on their laurels & chosen any roles, rose to the challenge of portraying two tragic figures: the aging closet gay Liberace & the lonely young man who gave himself up to this father figure with disastrous results. Without flinching, the actors boldly embody the eventual debased humiliation of both men.  intense & gripping; i highly recommend it - but not for the faint of heart.",1426982400,,880,4.7631578947368425
2322168,5,B0009UVCN0,"I had seen this movie a few years back when, I believe it was a made for TV production. At the time, I thought it was great and, after receiving it and viewing it again, my first reaction was absolutely right on. Victor Garber was fabulous in the lead role! I saw the latest movie with Mike Douglas and, although I like Mike Douglas as an actor, he seemed somehow miscast in the Liberace role. Also, there was another production and I think (but I'm not certain) that it was titled simply ""Liberace"" and it featured Andy Robinson (the bad guy in the first ""Dirty Harry"" film) and he absolutely nailed the part. I patiently await the arrival of this movie to DVD .",1426982400,,663,4.354838709677419

2322175,5,B0009UVCN0,Excellent story of Liberace with lots of details about his life. Perfect actors to play the parts. Loved it!,1405036800,,108,4.7368421052631575
2322176,3,B0009UVCN0,"With the success of ""Behind the Candelabra"" , I sought out this original version. It doesn't have the glitter and excitement of its competitor, but, it reads okay. It is no where as juicy as ""Candelabra"" so it looks a little feeble in comparison. Vincent barber delivers a solid performance, but, again pales next to Michael Douglas' engulfing portrayal. It looks a little deceptive in downplaying Liberace's dark controversies.
I still prefer ""Behind the Candelabra"".",1397088000,,468,5.253333333333333
2322177,5,B0009UVCN0,I enjoyed this very much but it still makes me sad to think about him and realized how he ruined his life.,1392163200,,106,3.8636363636363638
2322178,2,B0009UVCN0,"If you saw Behind The Candelabra, you may be disappointed with this. I didn't think Victor Garber even resembled Liberace, and I had a hard time ""accepting"" him in this role.",1390089600,,174,4.645161290322581
2322179,4,B0009UVCN0,This movie had more of the feel of a biographical piece.  Much lower budget than the HBO movie but none the less interesting.,1389657600,,125,4.434782608695652
2322180,3,B0009UVCN0,"Like many on here I thought this was the other, far superior US made for TV movie that came out in the late 80. I had seen it and remembered the fictional ""Miss Be Haven devirgin-izing scene"" but transposed both as the same film. The acting here is decent and Candelabra HBO fans like myself will have to admit that seeing an actual teenage actor in the role of Scott Thosron, albeit with a very clunky script, is a bit of a game changer.  As much as I loved Matt Damon's performance (and he does look much younger than his years) and find it superior, it did make me wonder what a 18 to 22 years old actor would have done with the part and how much more dramatic they would have looked as a couple. The production had very fake backdrops at one point and the studio lighting was mediocre. I wish that Liberace's final days had been dealt with more thoroughly and with more compassion. The worst was the ending where they mention AIDS and leave it like that with a cheap fast credit roll over a freeze frame. But Victor Garber was GREAT and Lee fans will still want to watch this. If anyone knows about the other Lee made for TV movie being available please let me know. This film has great 1950s dresses in it as an aside.",1385769600,3,1223,4.24892703862661
2322181,5,B0009UVCN0,"I saw Liberace on one of his last appearances before it was announced he had aids. I also bought Behind the Candelabra as well as Scott Thornson's book of the same name. Still...I had remembered this movie from tv and I wanted to see it again. Now I can see it many times and love this dvd. Very good for those who like Liberace and piano music, plus a good story.",1383523200,,364,4.140845070422535
2322182,4,B0009UVCN0,I thought that Victor Garber did a wonderful job in this very difficult role.  All of the cast were excellent.  I agree with the reviewer that there was a problem with the continuity particularly in the scenes where his father appeared but I didn't let it bother me. I think that anyone who loved Liberace would enjoy this movie.,1380931200,,329,4.559322033898305
2322183,2,B0009UVCN0,"Didn't realize this was a re-enactment of Liberace and not him performing, so I was really disappointed.  I guess I didn't read the description very closely before sending the order.",1378598400,,182,5.066666666666666
2322184,5,B0009UVCN0,I would recommend it all my friends. I really like the movie and I am very happy with it. It came quickly and in great condition.,1376092800,,129,4.0
2322185,5,B0009UVCN0,"I actually thought that this movie was even better than the new one starring Michael Douglas who has been nominated for an Emmy, and will probably win.  Victor Garber also should have been nonimanted for an Emmy and also won for his amazing performance.  He WAS Liberace.",1374192000,2,271,4.74468085106383
2322186,3,B0009UVCN0,"I purchased this item since the Emmy nominations came out today, 7/18/13. I enjoyed the HBO movie with Michael Douglass and Matt Damon. I also grew up watching Liberace on TV. I didn't worry about who he really was. Gays closeted themselves, since to have come out would have ruined their careers, much like mental illness has a stigma. Victor Garber was always a favorite actor of mine and I would like to see how his performance differs from the new version. In some ways the actual Liberace always seemed somewhat cartoonish. That is how he protected himself. I will probably have more to say after viewing the DVD. I also want to see if there is a mention of Scott Thorson, who wrote the book the Douglass/Damon version was based upon. Interest in the Thorson book has spiked and given him another fifteen minutes of fame. But one thing that can be said is Liberace was a talented musican.",1374105600,5,893,4.5875
2322187,5,B0009UVCN0,"After watching the HBO movie Behind the Candelabra I wanted to absorb as much Liberace as possible. I had seen this movie before, Behind the Music, but it had been years, so I ordered this movie. It is very well done, acting wonderful and does go into his earlier life which I wanted to see. If you are a Liberace fan, you will not be disappointed...it is a really good movie and has alot of his talent that some others movie did not show. Of course, Behind the Candelabra was strictly from Scott Thontons book, this movie has more of Liberace's professional life also. REMEMBER....too much of a good thing is...WONDERFUL!!!

2322188,3,B0009UVCN0,"After watching hbo,s ""behind the candelabra"" I wanted to see more about liberace. I saw another movie years ago, and I thought this was it.",1372896000,2,139,4.6
2322189,3,B0009UVCN0,"It was okay, but the recent TV movie was much better. This one softened Liberace's life and portrayed him as a nice guy who was caught up in things beyond his control. Of course, it was made in 1988 so his sexuality was barely touched upon, with the result being that the real Liberace didn't quite make it to the screen.",1370649600,2,321,4.278688524590164
2322190,5,B0009UVCN0,"This movie is wonderful fun.  I love movies like this.  It's trying to be a serious account of the life of Liberace.

2322191,3,B0009UVCN0,"I thought it was better when I first saw it years ago, but it would of been better too if the movie did not freeze up on me half way through the movie.",1365465600,2,151,3.606060606060606
2322192,4,B0009UVCN0,I remembered this made for tv movie - Liberace brought the original bling-bling.  He was outrageous.  This is a good movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon.,1364515200,,154,4.666666666666667
2322193,5,B0009UVCN0,"I remember watching the excellent made for TV movie when it was first presented so was glad I was able to pick up a DVD.  If you have read Liberace: The True Story, you will see it follows the book amazingly closely.  Very well done adaptation.  The young man who plays the part of Liberace did and excellent portrayal.  The casting crew did an amazing job in picking characters who closely resembled the actual people in Liberace's life.

After watching some YouTube clips on some of Liberace's performances, I was amazed to discover that the movie has taken even the exact words and I believe some actual concert footage to reproduce some of the most memorable scenes in his life.  Excellent movie..well worth watching if you, like me have been a fan of this amazing, one of a kind entertainer.",1364083200,3,796,4.65
2322194,3,B0009UVCN0,"The movie is way too short, and rather depressing. Liberace lived 67 years and had a full life. The movie does not capture Liberace's Magic of Believing. His magic on the stage was a performer which made you laugh and feel good, and this movie does not accomplish what so many loved about this man and his music.",1324425600,,312,4.396551724137931
