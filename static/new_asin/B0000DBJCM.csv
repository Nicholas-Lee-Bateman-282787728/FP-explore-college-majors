1921853,3,B0000DBJCM,Seniors often have difficulties with balance and this dvd contains two one legged poses. This is surprising since the AM/PM Chi dvd does not contain any. I believe that an exercise video marketed to seniors should not contain one legged standing exercises. That aside the rest of the movements demonstrated would be within the capacity of many seniors,1293148800,6,351,5.068965517241379
1921854,5,B0000DBJCM,"This is perfect for US! Easy to do, works my mind as well as working out the morning stiffness. This is a daily MUST !",1287100800,2,118,3.76
1921855,5,B0000DBJCM,This is a simple beginning Tai Chi exercise (or at least based on tai chi). Beautifully demonstrated and photographed on a beach with the waves in the background. It is only 20 minutes long which make it great for a warmup or when you are in a hurry before a stressful day.  Very relaxing slow movements.,1254960000,2,304,4.428571428571429
1921856,3,B0000DBJCM,"The Tai Chi instruction by David is excellent but tape has too much advertising and other ""junk"" at the beginning. You must sit through several minutes of this forced viewing before you can get to the subject of interest.",1234742400,7,221,4.6923076923076925
1921857,5,B0000DBJCM,"Energy Boost for Seniors is a must for anyone who is interested in T'ai Chi or other oriental based exercises that emphasize correct breathing, balance and coordination.  David-Dorian Ross presents the exercises in a style that is easy to follow.  One of the things that I appreciated about this DVD was that it was only 16 minutes in length.  At 81, this is a comfortable amount of time for me to be able to follow and do all the exercises.  These are exercises that can easily be learned and you can eventually make up your own routine so that you are not tied to just this one set of exercises.  I would encourage people to buy additional programs such as T'ai Chi daily practice.  This is two complete T'ai Chi workouts and would add to your repertoire.  There are many DVD's availble in T'ai Chi and I would encourage you to browse and buy what appeals to you.",1189641600,21,865,4.436708860759493
1921858,4,B0000DBJCM,"I love all of David Dorian Ross' Tai Chi DVDs but this one surprised me. Since it was labeled for Seniors, I thought it would be fairly easy to do. I actually found it to be the most challenging of his DVDs and even wondered if his title ""Energy Boost for Seniors"" referred to senior (master) tai chi experts. The kicks left me off balance and I thought that there should have been more references to adapting these moves to seniors who might have some physical issues. It seemed lacking in instruction.",1178928000,26,503,4.478260869565218
1921859,5,B0000DBJCM,"These simple exercises take only 20 minutes of your time. They are an excellent source for stretching your back muscles and clearing out the kinks.

So if you are new at this and have never done yoga or stretching exercises, be careful, don't overdo it and take your time. The verbal instructions are really good and the exercises are done slowly and methodically with meaningful explanations. And it does give one an energy boost. This type of energy is very fine and etheral but delivers a powerful boost. Also, this may not be for some people. Everyone is different and needs what works for them. But this definitely works for me and when I don't do them, at least every other day, I can tell the difference.",1172534400,17,711,4.5984251968503935
8000377,5,B0000DBJCM,"I was looking for a exercise that improve my breathing (asthma) and balance.  Something that did not take up half the morning and could be done in 10 minutes (after practicing).  With all the aches and pains of aging, the stretching eases the pain and improves balance a lot.  So far my hips have stopped hurting as much.  My back muscles are not causing spasms.  Had to modify the 'jar' part until I could really do the position, which took quite a while, but it show me just how bad my balance was at that time.  Yikes!  Great DVD, just try it.",1458604800,,546,4.294117647058823
8000378,4,B0000DBJCM,"I like the contents of this video but I returned it because I already have the content on a previous purchase. I have a 5 day Chi video with David-Dorian Ross (2 videos), McPhee (1 video), and Daisy Lee and Francesco Garripoli (2 videos). GaiamTV has produced this DVD from one, just one, of these five videos and called it something else. I believe this was the Energy Chi video on the earlier one that I have.

Check out 5 Day Fit Chi and you can get this and 4 more for little money.",1428105600,2,486,4.170212765957447

8000381,1,B0000DBJCM,"My experience was the same as the person who got two warning messages some logo stuff and what appeared to be the ""menu"" screen.  I watched for about 5 minutes then put on fast forward.  No menu ever appeared.  A request to go to menu started the back at the logo.

I also have a no-region dvd player.  Didn't work on that one either.  They have some quality control issues.",1412208000,2,374,4.271428571428571

8000383,2,B0000DBJCM,The beginning was good but when he showed you the lower body exercises you couldn't see what to do with your feet because his were buried in the sand.  I think this DVD is for people in their 50's and not  in their 70's.,1391040000,2,220,3.977272727272727
8000384,1,B0000DBJCM,"Due to late delivery I was not able to inspect this DVD until 25 days later. The only thing that worked were the two warning message and the intro loop video.  No instruction, no chapter. No visible ding or scratch on the DVD.  When I called Gaiam they said Amazon sells third party product and would not offer a refund. Gaiam's position was the DVD could be defective or could be counterfeit.  Amazon only offered 50% refund no replacement. Sparks does not offer any customer support.  I would not purchase product from Sparks DVD sales.",1374537600,6,538,4.631578947368421
8000385,1,B0000DBJCM,"I am very unhappy with the this DVD, it does not teach you how to do each movement separately. The DVD seems to come from a place that we are suppose to know all about Chi and the particular movements that where put together for the Energy Boost program. Well I am a beginner and it failed miserable with me. It is not a How to DVD!",1332028800,7,332,3.970149253731343
8000386,4,B0000DBJCM,"My 83 yo grandparents love it! They are not your average 83year olds, but I guess this is keeping them young! They showed me the stretching and the breathing. This is their 3rd one. I will be on the lookout for more",1305158400,4,215,4.142857142857143
