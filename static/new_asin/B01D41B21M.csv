7696611,5,B01D41B21M,"This dvd provides a workout that can be challenging or easy, depending on how hard one chooses to work.  But the entire 45 minutes of it will be a great deal of fun too.  When I say easy, I do not mean sit on a sofa easy, but rather that it is not hard to learn.  Each of the tracks has about four or five different moves.  The tracks are music that make you want to move.  So much so that the whole time goes by rather fast. I think the name Dance that Walk is a bit misleading.  This is not a walking video.  But more of an aerobic dance workout.  Though it is a low impact one. No worries about knee issues.  One of these days I will do this wearing a pedometer to see if there are actually 5000 steps involved.  I do know that it keeps a person in motion for the entire time though.  Yes, you will sweat some no matter the physical condition you are in, if you truly  give it your all.

I received this product at a discounted price so that I could evaluate it and share my findings.",1461110400,19,987,3.949238578680203

7696619,4,B01D41B21M,"I thought for a while before buying this because of so many mixed reviews. I also don't want to waste my $.  Im a huge Leslie Sansone fan. I alternate between her, Denise Austin, Jessica Smith and a few oldies of Richard Simmons.

This DVD was really fun!! Gina is very encouraging!! It kept my heart rate up especially during the faster numbers. I thought it was neat to know Ive done 5000 steps since I don't have a Fitbit. I think it will take me a few times using it to get all the steps right. Honestly though its good for my brain to try something different and learn new steps. Ive noticed that my body is getting used to Leslie Sansones cardio (not the toning ones) DVDs. When I do some of my other workout DVDs my heart rate is higher which can give me a more intense workout. I look forward to buying more of Ginas DVDs in the future.",1524873600,4,844,4.171779141104294

Also, as I do not like people, I now have my own personal trainer, without having to go out and deal with others, or anyone in real life! It still doesn't compare to when I still had my car and could drive just 10 mins to great nature walks and hikes, definitely away from everyone.

The moves are simple and Gina explains each one. This is a great alternative from walking outside in the rain or snow and also for those of use who do not own a treadmill.

7696651,5,B01D41B21M,"The best, most fun walk ever!  I so enjoyed this. It's low impact, the dance moves are fun, and now I know what ""partner arms"" mean.  You feel like you are dancing when doing the Charleston and not really working out.

But it is a workout!  I usually don't sweat any walking workouts (Leslie Sansone, Jessica Smith) but this one you do work up a sweat.  I have a bad knee and I can do this.  It helps me look forward to working out!  It is worth it.",1505865600,,449,4.034090909090909

7696654,2,B01D41B21M,"This DVD is fun if your goal is just to get up and move.  It is not good, at least for me, for working up a sweat  to lose weight.  All of the dance segments are only 3-4 minutes long; not enough time to raise your heartrate at all and certainly not enough time to keep it up long enough to burn any calories.  Each dance segment starts slow so that the dance steps can be explained.  so, you end up just beginning to get going with one segment and then having to stop and slow down to begin the next dance segment; never really building up speed and intensity for a good workout.
For someone like me, with two left feet, even the simplest dance steps were difficult. (not the videos fault, I know.)  and she loves to throw in that shoulder shimmy a lot; can't do that either.  Also, you cannot create your own workout routine like some of Leslie Sansone and Jessica Smith's videos allow you to do. So, I cannot pick the dance segments I can do and skip the ones I can't to create my own routine.
Your only option is to do the entire routine of 12 three minute segments or choose one routine at a time (i.e. go to the menu, select a dance segment, do the segment, go back to the menu, pick another segment, etc.): which makes it impossible to work up a sweat and lose weight.",1505347200,,1275,4.158536585365853
7696655,5,B01D41B21M,"Love the Latin Flair.  Not too hard, very basic, enough to get my heart rate up.  Good addition to my excercise library which consists mostly of walking at home tapes.  Works for me.  Thanks",1505260800,,190,4.5

7696657,5,B01D41B21M,"This covers most of the ballroom dances, and it breaks them up into 5 minute sections so that you don't get bored.

7696658,3,B01D41B21M,"I like the workout except for one thing - Gina only takes about 3 seconds to describe the dance moves. I'm sure I'm not the only one out there that doesn't know these dance moves. If she took more time showing us the steps, it would quite possibly be a lot more fun.

I purchased this DVD so that he and I could get a low impact workout in the privacy of our own home...and it's working.  He and I have started 'walking"" and my husband just said to me that he is feeling more energetic already.  Our goal is to lose weight to take some pressure off of the knees.  I also am a Type 2 diabetic and this working out helps lower my blood sugar and hopefully help with my A1c.

The music is fun and makes you want to move...move....move!  I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone with limitations.

One last thing, I do like how you can adjust the steps/movements to fit your own capabilities.  The video stresses ""just keep moving!""",1503446400,6,726,4.365671641791045

7696666,5,B01D41B21M,"This workout is so fun! I'm a fan of walk DVD's but they can get boring. Not this one. She alternates dance styles, so there is something for everyone in here. Just a few gentle dance moves in between walking steps. All the songs are great, and my favorites are the jive style songs. This workout makes you feel glamorous and feminine when you walk/dance the foxtrot. A little spicy when you walk/dance the samba. It's really fun!
The best part is, I'm 6 months pregnant and needs a workout which is easily adjusted to my abilities. This is so gentle if you need it to be, yet you can really kick it up (literally) if you're ready. The cues are spot on, Gina is personable, and the set is bright.

It sounded simple; however, the dance moves are hard to figure out with no explanation of how to do them and there are so few repetitions that there isn't time to figure them out before moving on to something else.

7696684,5,B01D41B21M,"This DVD offers a new twist on the walking workout - dance moves! But you already know that from the DVD's title and the description. Walking is my preferred cardio exercise, and while I enjoy a stroll outdoors if the weather is nice, I love walking videos to get a real workout. Some people think that walking videos are just walking in place, and yes, there is some of that, but each video provides other moves like kicks, knee lifts, side steps, lunges, squats, walking forwards and backwards, and other moves. Walking videos are basically low-impact aerobics, although some have periods of high impact moves, or periods of highly intense moves for interval training. This DVD has that - some of the dances are slower, like the Foxtrot, while others are fast, like the Jive. Some can be either, depending upon the music, like the Samba. The dance steps are easy to learn, even for beginners like me, and get your body moving like it never has before. The 45 minutes flies by very quickly. And if you are counting steps, like so many are these days, this is a good way to get 4000-5000 steps in a short period of time.

Gina is a great instructor, with a beautiful, infectious smile, and her mother Mila and friend Sarah help Gina demonstrate the dance moves.",1495411200,,1261,4.604444444444445

7696692,4,B01D41B21M,"Fun way to get in some dance moves, add steps to your fitbit/pedometer and work up a sweat. The three ladies smile their way through a series of dances (mambo, samba, flamenco, jive, quickstep and foxtrot), alternating the pace from fast to ""recovery"" and back again. When I first put the DVD in, I honestly thought I'd just do the warm up and maybe 2 or 3 of the dances to get started...but I had so much fun that I was at the cool-down dance before I knew it. For each dance, you learn four moves and I really feel more like I'm dancing than exercising! Fun way to get up and get active.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it promised me 5,000 steps and I can only get in about 4,000 from start to finish.",1492732800,3,712,4.085714285714285

Even after bronchitis, which stopped me from moving for three weeks, I am right back to this tape. The music is great, the Charleston is fun, I could do that move all day. The trainer knows her audience well and it helps that the moves are simple and doable. I so recommend this tape for anyone who needs to get into cardiovascular shape. It is a stepping stone that may always stay in my exercise lineup. Thanks so much for this. I've thrown so much junk away, and this one is just so GREAT!!",1491609600,,619,4.12396694214876

Good music--music changes with each track.  Fast tracks alternate with slower tracks so you can catch your breath.  Yes there is a lot of marching, but not too much and the dance steps are low-impact cardio standbys that you will be familiar with if you have done much low impact aerobics.  It is a little bit on the vigorous side.  Good menu to enable you to select specific tracks.

There are some parts of the regime however that appear somewhat ad-hoc  as if she didn't quite think the sequences through because she changes the steps without introducing them adequately which upsets the flow and leaves me scrambling to keep up.

The only thing I would change is to make the warm up a little slower and the cool down a little longer with more stretches, with some for calves and quads.  Some of the moves were too fast moving for me but I could modify them easily because I have dance experience.

No squats or deep lunges or rolling around on the floor. It's divided into 14 segments. You are doing at least a walk step the whole time in addition to other ""dance"" steps. There is a warm-up at the beginning and two cool down segments at the end. The other 11 segments tend to go back and forth between lower tempo and higher tempo so that even while working up a sweat, you never get to that, ""Oh, my gosh, I'm dying!"" point. If one is starting from a point of being in very good physical condition, this probably wouldn't be the most satisfying workout.",1488758400,,687,4.333333333333333

The variety of music is wonderful and it's skillfully paced. Also you will learn many dance movements so the mind body connection is being stimulated too!

7696767,4,B01D41B21M,"Fun walk.  Not really 5000 steps for me, but it gets me moving.  It's more challenging than I thought it would be, but quite doable, as I try to get back in shape.",1486166400,,163,3.909090909090909
7696768,5,B01D41B21M,"This is a fun routine with a very good instructor. The music is more than just Latin and it contains no hip hop which is a plus for us. This is not a high intensity workout but done properly can provide the benefits we are looking for. One of the pluses is that your learning some dance moves ie. Cha Cha, the Charlston, Foxtrot, and more. the cool down and stretch at the end are the most effective in our video selection. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun routine that keeps you thinking and entertained. The DVD arrived in two days.",1486080000,2,552,4.266666666666667
7696769,4,B01D41B21M,"Loved the music on this DVD and the instructor is pleasant to listen to, my issue was with the transitions from step to step.  They came quickly and there wasn't enough warning or explanation which was frustrating.  I've been doing the same walk at home program for years and wanted to add something new.  I guess I expected to jump right in and love it.  I will give it another chance and hope that repeated viewings will make it easier to enjoy.",1485993600,,447,4.414634146341464

7696776,5,B01D41B21M,I am 64 and had a hip replacement 4 months ago.  Having done Leslie Sansone for years I started up again 1 month after my surgery. I had worked myself beck almost to where I was but  since I am no longer supposed to do high impact I found SMILE.  It is REALLY fun.  I had no problem following it at all.  It is a very motivating workout. I will rotate this into my Leslie and Petra workouts. Thank you and God bless ,1485388800,,416,3.9518072289156625

It's easy to follow; it will make you sweat; and you will have fun! You won't even know that 45 minutes have past, it's so fun! I don't usually gush like this, but I have been working out regularly for 6 years now (for me that means 3-4 times/week for 25-30 minutes/workout); and this is the first workout DVD that I've been able to do without having to mix and match to get the kind of work out I want. It's broken up into segments so if you don't want to or don't have time to do the full 45 minutes you can skip around. There's a warm up and a 2 part cool down, which I think is awesome, and the ""dances"" are high energy and fun. Did I mention they're fun? They are! I find myself smiling along with Gina, and I am not one to smile while exercising. :D I was in dance classes for 13 years, and smiling during recitals was the hardest part of dancing for me, but Gina and this workout make me smile. I can't recommend it enough. I even saw on her website that an 80 year-old woman does this workout so you know it's fun and easy! :)",1484870400,3,1146,4.075221238938053

With the variety of music and mini dance routine it kept things moving and wasn't boring . I definitely recommend it .,1484784000,,288,3.9655172413793105
7696786,4,B01D41B21M,I've used it a couple of times and trying to get all of the moves down.  Gina doesn't give you advance warning before changing the routine so you have to catch up.

7696790,5,B01D41B21M,I gave this DVD a five star because it is a low impact walking exercise.  I have not exercised in a long time due to arthritis in the knees and back so it was extremely difficult to keep up with the fast pace of this program.  I am hoping in time I will be able to keep up with this exercise.  When I get tired I sit in a chair and keep moving to the beat.  I wish she made a DVD more in line for Seniors at a slower pace so we can work up to the faster pace.  This is a DVD I will have to work up to.,1484697600,3,501,3.4774774774774775

It wasn't as I expected - the description says this is an ""easy, low impact and easy to follow"" however, I found the steps in many of these tracks complicated and more intense than I expected from the way it's described.  There are multiple steps in each track and Gina goes very fast so it's hard to keep up.  I am finding it very frustrating to do and I'm sorry I bought it.

I've done every kind of home workout imaginable and have a vast collection, but find myself going through a rotation of about 15 dvds. I ordered this dvd and the double pack one by the same instructor, and they are about the most 'doable' workouts I've ever done. And will keep on doing. The walk dvds-Leslie Sansone, Jessica Smith-are great but they can get very boring when you're going for 5000 steps in a workout. What I like about these is each mini section has 4 steps. They are varied, and the music changes with each section. I don't get bored because of the many variations. The instructor is easy to follow and her cuing is great. I can't really find anything to complain about with these workouts. The more energy you put into the steps, the higher the heart rate, or you can keep it at a slower pace.

7696843,5,B01D41B21M,"I have done this workout one time so far. Folks, no lie this boosts your spirits; puts spring in your step and strengthens your whole body. Easy routines. You do not have to know how to dance. While latin inspired this is not complicated and exhausting like the big Z is. This workout by Gina is in a class all its own. Gina is enjoyable to listen to; sweet without being cloying. Her steps logically lead into the next and flowing into another level of intensity. I love it and will continue to do it. I am 64 yrs old and if I can get my fat fanny off the couch, so can anyone. I am already going to buy the disco/party hits for my next order. Can't wait. BTW when I get tired, I hop on my stationary bike for a bit and just keep going. This workout is also the type of thing I use to control my symptoms of severe depression and anxiety. Good feelings stay with me for a few hours. Increase my hope big time. Yay.",1477526400,45,915,4.060773480662983

At the same time I bought several other 'walk-based' DVDs, but Gina's were the best.",1477267200,,260,4.6521739130434785
7696848,2,B01D41B21M,I have the Sway dvd and love it because I have had a couple of surgeries that make exercising hard but sitting in the chair and doing the routine was great. I love it and feel like I am accomplishing something  So I decided that perhaps Dance the Walk would let me add another dvd to my collection. I expected it to be at the same rate of workout movements as the chair one.  Boy was I ever surprised with this one.  You need to be in really good shape because you will spend a lot of time speed walking.  I would buy another dvd from them as long as it was chair aerobics.  This one is to fast paced unless you are in great shape.,1477094400,3,631,3.9761904761904763

I try it each day from the beginning and try to meet or surpass what I accomplished the day before. It's confusing at first only because you don't know the routines but you'll soon get by that problem so don't give up just because you can't seem to figure out her steps or think she's going to fast. It's easier day two, easier yet day three etc..

It's a lot of fun to add a little dancing in with all the walking - nothing too challenging - and I like the way it speeds up for one set, and then slows down for the next, so I don't get overwhelmed.  The instructor seems like a nice girl you'd like to know.  No superiority or feeling that she's judging you.  And, she has her Mom exercising with her!

I love that if I can't do a move, I can still walk and have fun with Gina, her mom Mila and her friend and just pick it back up as I am able to move.  I have done the workout everyday since I bought it and I feel so much better.  I can actually walk without pain.  I just needed to get my body to move again and this DVD helped me.  To all of you that have pain issues, just do as Gina says...... walk.",1472774400,2,537,3.5775862068965516
7696889,5,B01D41B21M,"OK...So I have been walking, but since there are days when the weather or time does not cooperate, I find myself walking aimless circles around my house while listening to music.  This DVD gave me something to actually walk along to, and the instructor is fun and easy to follow.  Even when I don't particularly care to do the steps, the music changes make it fun to walk, and in some cases, try to keep up or make up my own steps.

At any rate, I am usually thirsty, mildly sweaty, and feeling pretty good when I finish the 45 minute workout.  And some days, I just hit rewind and do some of my favorite dances again!  Just to get in more steps.

Oh...my favorite part is Gina's mother Mila.  She messes up a few times, and it makes me feel more normal.  I love that they don't edit it to make it seem possible, it just is.  And to watch her subtle mistakes, makes me feel better about my imperfections too!

Gina is a good leader.  My only minor ""complaint"" is that I don't really like some of the music, and occasionally the beat of the music doesn't seem to go with the steps.  This is a good video, thought:  you can feel it working muscles all over your body, in good way.  Buy it--you'll be glad you did!",1472083200,,556,4.188679245283019

Not so with this workout.  It is kind on my knee, and VERY challenging to my body.  The first time I did it, I did it all the way through.  By the end, I felt like I had spent 2 hours in a sauna -- I really enjoy all the sets, but need time to lean them all.  The workout doesn't forget your arms either.

Now when I do the tape, I set up a series of exercises from the menu (very handy!) so I'm able to function afterwards, and don't feel like a limp dishrag.

7696917,3,B01D41B21M,"I want to make it clear that this is a fun little workout with a GREAT mix of musical selections, but I wish I had realized that it is as low impact as it is.  I am in my mid 50's and used to low to intermediate workouts but this one did not challenge me at all.  For example, I love a good Leslie Sansone workout but steer away from overly strenuous or high impact routines.  I think with this one, I probably would have gotten more of a workout sweeping my porch.  However, it makes a great workout for someone new to exercising, someone with limited mobility or an elderly person who wants a basic workout without the risk of injury.  I gave it to my mother and I think she will enjoy it - some of the music will bring back memories for her!",1468195200,20,744,4.068493150684931

I liked being able to learn things like the fox trot and the charleston etc. Its a good workout and gets your heart rate up. The color scheme is very cheerful and clean looking. Its very inviting and enjoyable. I did receive this video at no cost in exchange for an honest review. I wouldn't mind if I'd had to pay for this because I like it. I will get much use out of it.

7696953,4,B01D41B21M,"SMILE  Social Movement Improves Life Everyday is a wonderful concept.  The SMILE teams mission is ""to make exercise fun, low impact and accessible for all.  Their other DVD  is a dance workout done while seated in a chair  developed out of their experience of teaching ballroom dancing in nursing homes.  I am now aware of all this and applaud it, but on my first trial of the workout, I personally found the big SMILE logo on the back wall just (annoyingly) kept making me think of a dental practice!

The white setting and bright colors reminded me of childrens TV programs, as did Ginas incredibly cheery attitude  so if you want to do this workout with your kids, as some reviewers have done, I imagine many children will find it attractive.  Sadly, I don't have kids, so I personally found it a bit over the top.  But I do love the fact that Ginas Mom is one of the dance demonstrators (someone my age).

Most of my workout DVDs are by Americans.  Im Australian, so it was refreshing for me to have a local leading the workout.  American audiences might well love Ginas voice, as we are told the Aussie accent is popular in the USA.  (Its not a broad accent, so I don't think thered be too much difficulty understanding her.)

I agree that the title is a little misleading.  Its really not a Walking Workout  at least not anything like Leslie Sansones.  (I have a few of hers, and I think Dance That Walk is much more complex.)  This is a series of dance steps, interspersed with walking on the spot. If you found the dance steps too difficult, you could walk in place and just enjoy the different paces of music for each track (and the bright, cheerful colors).  If you're not familiar with the dance steps already, it might take a few attempts to get the hang of them, as there is not really any teaching or breaking down of the steps.  But thats the benefit of a DVD  you can go over any section as often as you need.  And by not breaking the steps down slowly, the great thing is that this is a non-stop workout from beginning to end. (14 tracks)

It takes me about 1  hours to walk 10,000 steps.  This workout goes for 45 mins, so the claim that its over 5,000 steps seems pretty accurate to me.  And, being dance, the pace is faster than I would walk.  I definitely worked up a sweat and enjoyed the variety of dances.

Not only is it ear friendly but it's energizing, full off pizazz, motivating and so much fun to do, I absolutely love it, but hey! you need to try it and I know you will love it.
I have always been a little conservative in my reviews with my previous exercise DVD's this one really ticks all the boxes. I would absolutely no doubt about it recommend it to all age groups and to everyone. Adding this DVD to the weeks routine works fabulously.
