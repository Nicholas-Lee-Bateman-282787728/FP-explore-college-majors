8102593,5,B000DN5VLM,"I really love watching B-Westerns!
And this one is a real fan favorite as Bob Steele and Buck Conners help Roberta Gale bring her herd through the pass blocked by bad-guy Steve Clark. There's lots of side switching as Bob & Buck fistfight their way through hordes of henchmen. Bob dynamites the pass at the end, blowing Clark's gunmen to kingdom come!
This one was directed by Bob's father, Robert Bradbury and features heavy Earl Dwire (pretending to be Bob's lost stepfather). Dwire cheats at cards and when he draws on Bob gets gunned down by Buck! This scene is fast and realistic and shows Buck to be more than the typical sidekick.
Footnote: Buck Conners who plays Fuzz, a white-whiskered old timer, was (according to author Bobby Copeland in his exceptional book B-WESTERN BOOT HILL) buried behind a Chinese restaurant in Quartzite, Az.(1947). I'm not too sure I'd want to eat there...
So if you like good action-packed B-Westerns then check this one out. The Alpha dvd is really pretty good for a 70+ yr.old movie...Good stuff all 'round!",1186617600,2,1046,4.816666666666666
