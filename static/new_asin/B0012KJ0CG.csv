3090825,1,B0012KJ0CG,"Ahem, let me just see if I got this right. This is a US remake of a recent Japanese horror film, helmed by a duo of... French directors, with Jessica Alba as the main blind (!) character? And, like ""The Grudge 2"", ""The Ring 2"" and numerous other Hollywood remakes of mid-grade J-horror, it hasn't been screened for critics... Hmmm. Maybe one shouldn't expect a masterpiece here.
It's not. Not by a long stretch. Aside from a few nice visual touches here and there, the film is poorly directed, acted, edited, scripted, lit - and worst of all, it never approaches even the mediocre original's (directed by the Oxide brothers) ability to raise chills.
I would go into intricate plot details, but let's face it - if you're going to watch it, you don't want me to spoil whatever flimsy attempts at twists this film makes. And if you're not going to watch it (I predict this will be the majority), you won't be bothered to read this review.
So I'll take the rest of my time trying to convince those of you still reading NOT to watch this film.
I mean, name ONE decent Jessica Alba performance. (""Sin City"" doesn't count - all she does in it is dance.) She has never been, and never will be a contender for an Oscar nomination - unless she plays a paralyzed deaf mute with a bandaged face. She's sexy, but as an actress leaves a lot to be desired.
Why would you want to go watch ""The Eye"", when such films as ""No Country for Old Men"", ""Michael Clayton"", ""There Will Be Blood"", and, if you're looking for shocks, ""Cloverfield"", are playing in theaters? Trust me, you've seen it all before: the uncanny hazy visions, darkly lit atmospheric corridors, eerie noises and a predictable finish. This is clearly a case of ""let's hire some fresh European directors to remake some film for a quick buck."" Hopefully, there won't be any bucks.
Go watch the original Japanese version instead - while no classic by a stretch, it's  more entertaining than this dreck. Or, even better, go see what the directors are capable of in their far superior debut feature ""Them"", a 75-minute sustained terror trip, and let this shallow, pointless feature become a flop.
Maybe then they'll stop making 'em.",1201824000,6,2174,4.603092783505154
3090826,5,B0012KJ0CG,"For those of you who didn't know this is a Remake of the Hong Kong version, & although I prefer the Hong Kong version, I'd say they still did a good movie, but with the Blu-ray improvement it also means that you get to see the ghosts more clearly as Projections, which at times bothered me since those scenes were supposed to scare you but it did the opposite. Other than that it's worth a watch.",1484438400,,396,4.223684210526316

3090829,3,B0012KJ0CG,"The Eye is watchable, but nothing great that you're ever likely to watch a second time. Basically Jessica Alba gets a cornea transplant so she can see again.  But the donor corneas allow her to see things, she doesn't want to.  It has a few good scenes but mostly it's pretty slow.  It has a few Final Destination type premonitions of death scenes, but they aren't as good, or as entertaining as the ones in that film. Jessica Alba does a decent enough job in this American remake of a Chinese film, as does Chloe Moretz and the other minor screen time actors, but it's a bit too slow to keep you glued to the screen, and scenes that should make you squirm or scare you, don't really do that.",1482105600,,692,4.3076923076923075

3090866,1,B0012KJ0CG,"In 2002, the Pang Brothers released one of the best Asian ghost stories in recent memory, ""The Eye."" It was spooky, eerie and tragic...

... so of course, Hollywood decided that it needed a remake. With Jessica Alba. And like so many remakes, it belly-flops into forgettable mediocrity -- partly due to Alba's awkward two-expression acting, and partly because co-directors David Moreau and Xavier Palud... simply do not have the indefinable skill that makes a horror director good.

After many years of blindness, Sydney (Alba) is given a corneal transplant that finally restores her sight. Everything is going beautifully after the transplant, although Sydney is a little bewildered. Then she starts seeing things that she shouldn't -- ghosts who repeat what they did before they died, people who have just expired, and dark shadows that escort them away. Oh, and fire. She keeps seeing fire.

Unsurprisingly, her friends and doctors think that she's having some sort of weird reaction to all the new input coming into her brain, but Sydney knows that her new corneas have somehow given her supernatural powers. So she begins investigating the woman whose corneas she currently has, hoping to bring peace to her soul.

I'd like to mention that I am NOT one of those hipsterish people who pretend that all American remakes are automatically bad or inferior to the original, nor do I labor under the provincial delusion that Hollywood is the only movie industry that remakes stuff from other countries. In fact, the American ""The Eye"" isn't even the first remake of this story -- there was a 2005 remake over in India.

So I can say without prejudice that this movie is terrible. To the credit of Palud and Moreau, they try painfully hard to stick to the Hong-Kong movie -- almost every scene is identical, and some of the spooky moments are copied shot-by shot.

But there's something... missing. It's difficult to exactly put your finger on what is wrong with the movie, but it simply is not scary -- there are things that should be skin-crawlingly creepy (Sydney realizing that her reflection is not her face) that just feel vaguely dull. Some of this also comes from the music, which tends to be bland and tensionless, even during dramatic or scary scenes.

Also, Jessica Alba. She is possibly the worst choice possible for a horror movie. This woman has two facial expressions, and neither one of them is fear -- so whenever Sydney is horrified or frightened, Alba just scuttles around looking vaguely displeased.

And this is what truly kills ""The Eye."" There are countless scenes that strain pathetically to be frightening, and almost are able to be. Consider when Sydney is trapped in an elevator with the levitating, slowly-approaching ghost of a dead man... and Alba just stands in a corner making ""scared"" noises, aperformance that is embarrassing to watch. This movie needed Sarah Michelle Gellar or Jessica Chastain instead of.... this.

And you get the sense that none of the other actors are really invested in this. Alessandro Nivola seems like he's sleepwalking through his role as the kindly doctor, and his chemistry with Alba is so nonexistent that you're left wondering why he'll risk his career to help her. And Parker Posey's role is so empty and flat that I literally did not notice that she was in the movie until it was halfway over.

""The Eye"" tries its hardest to be like the movie it remakes, but the subtle spookiness of the Brothers Pang is missing. The scariest thing is how hideously unconvincing Jessica Alba's performance is.",1400716800,2,3559,4.906821963394343

This movie is a perfect example of that, and the hubris it takes to tinker with someone else's work (with the intention of improving it?).  This update of the Pang Brothers' film The Eye is anything but an improvement.  It takes `some' of the elements in the original movie and summarily ruins their intent, turning key scenes into sight gags, minimizing their impact.  It was a shocking display of incompetence.  This is the work of vandals, not filmmakers!  They didn't get anything right.  Where the original was poetic and touching, this sham of a remake was noisy, brash, and not a little stupid.  It didn't help that lead actress went from Wonder Woman to an overwrought neurotic ninny in the blink of an eye.  (Not for nothing was Jessica Alba nominated for a Razzie for worst actress of the year.)  Her doctor (misplayed by Alessandro Nivola) wasn't much better.  Nivola managed to turn his sympathetic, caring character into a nasty, angry skeptic!  It defeated the whole purpose of their relationship.

This was a complete misfire on all levels; a totally unnecessary remake.  Not a keeper.

And in case there is any doubt, no, I didn't like it.",1345161600,,1200,4.813725490196078
3090885,2,B0012KJ0CG,"HUGE SPOILER ALERT!!! ~ ~ ~ Do Not Read This Review If You Have Not Seen The Movie!!!

I stumbled upon this movie on cable TV having not seen it from the beginning. My first thought was this effort is clearly an EYE CANDY movie for Jessica Alba fans because she is young and pretty and apparently single, ""in this movie."" But on the whole, I have 10 good reasons to support the title of this review:

Check out what we are treated to in THE EYE:

[1] SCREAM: The leading lady, Jessica Alba, is named ""Sydney,"" just like back in 1996 when we saw Neve Campbell play the role of ""Sidney Prescott.""

[2] CARNIVAL OF SOULS, HALLOWEEN, FUNHOUSE, TOURIST TRAP, THE FOG, THE RING, HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES and very many other classic ""horror"" movies ALL have a young, pretty, single girl as THE leading attraction.

[3] A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET: We have the REAL cut on the arm that comes out of a dreamlike sequence ~ AND ~ The idea of showing a pretty young girl in a nightgown in a darkened public hallway.

[4] THE EXORCIST: The quick-flash use of what some people call ""Subliminal Suggestion"" occurs right before Jessica Alba notices the cuts on her arm ~ just like the dream sequence sufferd by Damien Karras in THE EXORCIST.

[5] PSYCHO: Alba takes a shower and we see her naked feet step onto the floor and we also see a shower curtain in the sequence . . . at one point in the movie, Alba looked like the little girl in THE RING. There were also some camera techniques used that reminded me of THE RING.

[6] POLTERGEIST: There is the ""eyeball mirror"" moment with Alba which reminds me of the guy in the bathroom in that chilling sequence from the 1980's classic.

[7] THE EVIL DEAD: The trap door in the floor idea.

[8] CARNIVAL OF SOULS: Alba and that guy with the glasses are driving along and you see the moon through the far passenger window ~ a visual technique used in CARNIVAL OF SOULS.

[9] The 1975 novel AUDREY ROSE: The girl and the flames idea. ( . . . and/or Stephen King's FIRESTARTER?)

[10] SPEED: The bomb on the bus idea.

So you see, this movie was entirely DESIGNED to brainwash the viewer into thinking it is a good movie via the success of past Hollywood efforts ~ ~ ~ THERE IS NOTHING NEW HERE.

One physical body walking through another physical body has been done before, the use of a linguistic translator to heighten mystery or suspense has been used before; really, it just goes on and on and on.

In the end, I belive it might have been (or perhaps could still be?) an interesting choice to attempt this effort in the form of a story by classic British horror novelist Graham Masterton ~ though that idea merely describes my silly little fantasy version upon the matter, and that is all.

Enjoy the movie!  (But why buy the DVD? Jessica Alba did a good job of acting in a flimsy and weak screenplay.)",1342224000,,2831,4.372137404580153

3090888,5,B0012KJ0CG,"While alot of people seem to be down on this American remake of 'The Eye', I think that it was very well done.  I think the movie itself was a pretty good portrayal of the original movie.  I feel that this movie was an excellent remake and is also one of the few remakes that is as good if not better than the original.  American cinema is famous for destroying J-Horror movies (think One Missed Call or Shutter), but this movie is an excellent compliment to the original.

I like that the director did not feel the need to bring the characters to Asia to get the true feel of the original.  I think it was a great choice using an LA and Mexico story line, instead of making it an exchange student in Japan botch job like the Grudge 2.  You definately have a few creepy scenes in here, but overall I think the movie is pretty well done.  I also think Jessica Alba plays her part very well, however I do not like her male doctor at all.

I was glad and astonded that they used the creepy old man, and I though the addition of the ghostly little kid was cool too! (have you seen my report card?)  Finally, the end was a perfect North American compliment to the original ending, and paid homage to the original movie while still retaining its own originality.

I definately recommend this movie, you should go and check it out.  Definately get the original and this one and draw your own conclusions.",1308787200,,1397,4.314176245210728

3090893,3,B0012KJ0CG,"If you've already watched the HK original of ""The Eye"", i.e. ""Jian Gui"", then you may want to skip this as the original is much creepier and more credibly acted than this remake. Jessica Alba plays the role of blind concert violinist Sydney Wells who receives a corneal transplant that allows her to see again (she lost her eyesight in a freak childhood accident). Trouble is, she sees more than she wants to as the transplant enables her to 'see' the supernatural world around her where the recently dead are escorted to the other side by supernatural beings, restless souls haunt their former homes, etc.

It doesn't take too long before Sydney realizes there is more to her 'gift' and that she needs to find out the story of the donor in order to put an end to her own torment. She is aided by a psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola). The action is fast-paced but I felt that the scary scenes were less credibly set up than in the original HK movie. It almost seems comical the way Sydney experiences one supernatural jolt after another. The effects were slick but I felt there was too much CGI and overly loud sound effects which did nothing to increase the spooky factor.

The original movie had lots of atmosphere and genuinely creepy moments that had me practically jumping out of my seat (there's one scene in the original where the main character is taking a calligraphy lesson and a spirit literally attacks her out of nowhere for sitting in the departed soul's seat - very scary and nicely executed). Such scenes are lacking in this movie, and those that are meant to scare viewers fail to do so.

Alba plays her role quite well, but it is not an extraordinary performance (I felt the HK actress was amazing and much more credible in the original). Nivola is ok as eye candy but not much else. Final verdict - watch the original if you can, it's a much more rewarding viewing experience, but if you absolutely can't stand a subtitled movie, then this serves as an OK substitute.",1282608000,,2003,4.605042016806722

Sydney decides to get a double corneal transplant, which restores her sight. While she is recovering from the operation, she starts seeing things that are not there.

3090899,4,B0012KJ0CG,"The Eye starts off rather boring, and definitely NOT scary. However, after you get by the first 30 minutes, the unexplainable scares Jessica Alba's character begins to see really get going and *this* is when the story takes off.

The story begins with Jessica's character portraying a blind woman, but soon she gets surgery that allows her to see. The movie does a great job allowing Jessica's character development to build, and making it believable that we really ARE seeing someone learn to use their eyes after years of not being able to see at all.  Good detail here.

As soon as her vision gets settled in, she starts seeing dark, ghostly figures that definitely aren't friendly by any stretch of the imagination.

She soon realizes that whenever she sees these ghostly figures, she is seeing them because a death has taken place recently around the area, and these ghosts have come to take away people who have died recently.

Sometimes the scares are truly disturbing, such as the one involving a little kid who kept asking her if she'd seen his report card. That part was a bit funny, because it's easy to see WHY his report card was so bad- he spends all day hanging around the hotel hallways, haha.

However, the kid actually died, and when Jessica discovers this, any future encounter with the boy will only result in something horrifying... but I won't spoil what actually happens.

Another very freaky part is when she actually walks *through* another woman while walking across the street.  You will see what's up with this scene after you get used to the storyline.

Those aren't the only dead people she sees either- she sees plenty of other people too.  Wait until you see what happens whenever she looks at a mirror.

The movie does a terrific job keeping the ghostly figures few and far between, allowing tension to build, and allowing us to appreciate the horror aspect when it unfolds.

A great movie, but please, take time to get used to a slow-moving storyline in the beginning, and you will probably be satisfied with the film by the conclusion.",1265414400,,2070,4.735376044568246

Alba proved she's more than a pretty face and acted superbly, though the plot and script are the downside to this film. It had a nice story going but I felt it ended a little soft.

3090903,5,B0012KJ0CG,"Horror films can be great even if they are not terrifying.  ""The Eye"" happens to be one of those films.  The film won't necessarily scare the audience, but with a deep enough story, and a good plot line with likable characters, the film can definitely make for an exciting viewing time, despite the anti-climatic ending.  Personally, I believe that this film is highly under-appreciated.

The story revolves around a young woman named Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) who has been blind the majority of her life.  Years in darkness have taught her to utilize her other senses in order to sustain a well organized life.  The opening scenes of the film show the audience that Sydney has not only overcome her handicap of visual impairment, but she is quite comfortable with it as well.  Living the life of a well known concert violinist, Sydney appears to be quite content with her lifestyle.  Until the day she decides to try out a new medical procedure that promises to restore her eyesight.

In an attempt to regain her eyesight that she lost as a child, Sydney (Alba) goes through with corneal transplant surgery.  She awakes in a dark hospital bedroom.  She cannot see too clearly at the moment, her vision impaired with blurry images.  This turns out to be the least of her worries.  Immediately after waking up in her hospital room, Sydney sees the image of an elderly woman who is being taken away by a dark shadowy figure.  The initial appearance of the ghost is well timed, allowing a decent shock for the viewer, but not one that is good enough to actually scare them either.

Slowly, she begins to see more ghostly images, ranging from a local coffee shop, to her own apartment complex.  These images cause Sydney to seek help from an eye specialist, Dr. Paul Faulkner, who promised to teach Sydney how to readjust to the sense of sight.  Upon telling Paul that she has been seeing strange images, Paul simply tells Sydney that she is still adjusting to her new sense.  What he doesn't know is that the images are real, and appear to be occurring more frequently.  As it turns out, Sydney received the eyes from a dead woman who also was capable of seeing ""ghosts"".  The woman committed suicide after tormenting images haunting her night and day turned the small Mexican village where she resided against her.

I find the story to be quite compelling and the characters are very easy to relate to.  The ending was nothing spectacular, and may have been a little too anti-climatic to garner enough praise.  The film may leave some viewers searching for more details, but it ends too abruptly to allow for further insight.  The pacing is done quite nicely, and the development of the plot proceeds quite smoothly, allowing the audience to get to know the characters better.  The movie has some tense scenes in it, mainly at the hospital after the initial images begin to occur, but the scary factor dwindles with time and the movie becomes more of a ""mystery"" film than a horror one.  Being one of Jessica Alba's biggest roles in a movie, I believe she did an excellent job of portraying the torment that she was going through.  The lighting of the film and the camera techniques added to the overall ambiance that generated the feeling of tension when needed.  The movie was not ""scary"" but was instead ""suspenseful"" and well developed, in my personal opinion.  If you're a fan of Jessica Alba (like me) or of horror films, you really can't go wrong with adding ""The Eye"" to your collection, just don't expect it to make you sleep with the lights on.",1258588800,3,3554,4.677938808373591

It's a bitter enough pill that gorgeous and incredibly hot Jessica Alba never gets naked EVER nor does she have any love interest in the movie. But to make matters worse the story was this same bland plot with a beautiful blind violinist girl getting to see again from a cornea transplant only to have visions of her dark past. I mean what it is that anybody thought would be interesting about a dull plotline like that is beyond me! And it still ends the same stupid way as the original. I won't give away what the ending was that much but only I will say that after Jessica Alba saves the people from a gas tanker explosion during a traffic jam why then wouldn't she instead be getting used to seeing as well as having no further flashbacks about the donors incident in the past. That would have been a better turn out. If you read my other review for the original the said ""incident"" is not any different really.

3090921,2,B0012KJ0CG,"Jessica Alba is Sydney Wells, a concert violinist who has recently received an eye transplant. The operation is a success, but soon she starts seeing scary things that other people cannot see. Could it be that her new eyes are deceiving her, or is she just imagining things?

The film's premise itself is fairly interesting, but ""The Eye"" fails to really interest us because of its derivative story and the lack of scare. It was a bit shocking for me to see the director team David Moreau and Xavier Palud, responsible for their brilliant film ""Them,"" using so many familiar tricks of horrors like sudden big sound or shadowy figure moving around.

The 2002 Hong Kong film (directed by the Pang brothers), upon which this new version is based, made a good use of the premise against the background of the Asian locations and culture. It may not be the greatest horror film (or maybe I should not call it a horror as the story was more about the characters - the recipient and the donor - than about the terrors they experience), but the direction was imaginative and Angelica Lee's acting as the tormented heroine was splendid. Unfortunately Jessica Alba's performances as the terrified heroine is not as good as Lee's and supports including Alessandro Nivola and Parker Posey are not very memorable.

As you know, films with stories related to ""the second sight"" are nothing new (remember ""The Eyes of Laura Mars""? or how about ""Blink""?) To create a truly engaging film, however, you need something more, something that makes the whole film more suspenseful or some clever twist as in ""The Dead Zone"" or, naturally, ""The Sixth Sense.""

The only hitch is that with her new eyes - which were donated by a young lady with psychic powers - comes the unasked-for ability to see into the spirit world and predict the future.

""The Eye"" might have been an interesting film had it focused solely on how a once-blind girl learns to adjust to life in a suddenly sighted world.  Instead, we're subjected to an inane, gimmicky thriller in which the heroine improbably manages to run across either a dead person or someone doomed to die just about every time she turns a corner.

3090924,3,B0012KJ0CG,"There's always room for one more thriller to slide a chill or two through the cracks around our casements. I'm not sure though that ""The Eye"" quite does the job. It's not too bad, but it's too much of a re-tread.

It might remind the viewer of any number of 1950's drive-in horror flicks that featured reanimated body parts. There was ""The Hand,"" the ""Head,"" and indeed a host of either transplanted or disembodied eyes with minds of their own. So the idea that a pair of transplanted eyes can see things that their new owner never saw - is an old one.

Then this film also recycles a lot of its special effects from ""The Grudge"" and ""The Ring"" - right down to specifics, including a pair of feet levitating behind the person riding on an elevator.

""The Eye"" is also somewhat disappointing in that no real chemistry ever develops between the blind woman who receives an eye transplant and the doctor who counsels her after the operation. Although at the end of the film, the two take a dramatic road trip together in order to solve the mystery of the alarming visions that Jessica Alba's character is having - no convincing bond forms between them.

Finally, a volley of what initially sounded to me like pseudo-scientific rationales are delivered to make the premise of this film sound possible. They invoked entanglement and other concepts from quantum physics to make a convincing case that memories can reside in separate body parts. I laughed this off at first. But coincidentally, right after seeing ""The Eye,"" an article appeared in an authoritative scientific magazine explaining that researchers are now coming to believe more literally in ""body knowing."" In their artificial intelligence departments, they are finding that in order to build effective robots, they have to distribute intelligence throughout all the functioning parts of the robot, rather than centralizing commands in a ""brain."" They now believe that this distributed intelligence is actually a better model of how humans themselves function. The article concluded that different parts of the body inform the brain with their memories and intelligences, rather than the other way around.

3090926,2,B0012KJ0CG,"The Eye is the latest American remake of an Asian horror film, this time of the Hong Kong produced film of the same name.  The general theme of nearly all of these Americanized remakes is stick with the original!  I know...some of you don't like to read subtitles but in the case of this film, the original is vastly better.  Jessica Alba continues to get starring roles without demonstrating any particular skill at acting and she's no better here.

She plays a blind concert violinist named Sydney Wells who undergoes cornea transplant surgery to restore her sight.  The operation proves to be successful but soon after, Syndey begins experiencing horrific visions.  At first she thinks these are just nightmares and tries to pass them off but she soon becomes convinced that she's seeing things that the cornea donor saw.  Her Doctor (Nivola) thinks it's merely stress from dealing with the new sensations of her restored sight.

Sydney continues to ""see dead people"" although why her eyes also allow her to HEAR dead people remains a mystery of the film.  The visions are mostly those fleeting glimpses designed to make you jump in your seat although they never amount to any prolonged tension.  Sydney is determined to find out who the donor is and what message they are trying to send with the visions.  While she will learn that donor had a sort of precognitive power to see people's deaths and attempt to prevent them.  This, however, doesn't explain why Sydney would see the ghost of a little boy in her building who is looking for his report card nor the ghost of the little girl in the hospital who died of cancer.  It's just one of the many senseless continuity gaffes in ""The Eye"".  Sydney is also able to see mysterious shadow creatures, which seemingly escort dead spirits off to wherever.  These creatures appear to be evil so are they devils?  They don't like that Sydney can see them but that plot twist goes virtually untapped.

Alba is easy on the eyes (no pun intended) but she lacks any presence or charisma in this role.  The only real strength of her performance was her emotions and struggles as a formerly blind person who is able to see for the first time in decades.  As tedious as Alba was, her co-star Alessandro Nivola is even more boring.  He defiantly tells Sydney that he could ruin his career if he reveals who the donor is...and then he goes and steals the file anyway.

The Eye freely borrows clich&eacute;s from just about every other J-Horror film that's been made in the last decade but none of them are exciting enough to save this film.  Sydney may have had her eyes opened in the film but she'll make ours close tightly.

Along with her new eye sight, she gains a 2nd sight.  She can see dead people and, I guess you would call them, grim reapers.  She also has a therapist that does not believe her during most of the movie, but eventually comes through for her and helps her.

This movie almost borders on boredom for me, but it kept my attention with the mystery of why she was seeing the dead.  I wasn't use to seeing Jessica Alba in a film like this, but I thought she did a great job at carrying the film and her acting was convincing, at least for me.

Maybe, the overall film could have been better, but I have nothing to base that off of.  Nothing to offer as to what could be added or done different, but the film tells a story and concludes with answers to questions about the plot of the movie.  So, it wasn't terribly bad, but I wouldn't watch it again.

3090933,3,B0012KJ0CG,"Perhaps I enjoyed this movie more because I went into it with very, very, very low expectations.  The plot and premise seemed flimsy and ridiculous, and even though I do like Jessica Alba, I wasn't sure decent acting could save a plot that seemed so trite and boring.  But partway through my opinion began to change.  I decided this isn't really a horror movie, not in the classical sense of what has taken over the horror genre (gore like Saw and Hostel).  It's a supernatural mystery with a bit of suspense, if you want to get long-winded and technical.  Nothing about it was implicitly scary, but it was interesting and drew me along.  I wanted to see the end, and not just to find out if I'd won the classic 'guess who survives' horror movie game.

Sure, the premise is implausible and the entire story is completely unbelievable, but it was an entertaining movie and was fun to watch.  I don't ask for realism in my movies (okay, not most of the time!), all I want is to be entertained and this movie, while neither greatly original nor brilliantly written, was enjoyable enough.  Horror/suspense fans looking to pass an eventful evening would enjoy this one, but if you're looking for more than that, don't bother.",1216339200,28,1220,4.637209302325582
3090934,2,B0012KJ0CG,"Some of the American remakes of Asian horror films are worthy of our time and some are not. For instance, the American version of The Ring--with the exception of the incompetently directed, terribly acted initial 10 minutes or so--is actually better than the Japanese version, and a very good ghost story in its own right. The American version of The Grudge is also quite effective as a horror movie. As for The Eye, you're much better off watching the original Pang brothers' Chinese version. For example: One of the key segments of the story is when the main character finds out who donated her transplanted corneas, and sets off to learn what she can about the donor. In the Pang's film, these sequences are pretty startling and creepy, are much more effectively edited, and, compared to the American remake, make better use of sound and camera movement to build suspense. By contrast, this same section of storyline in the American re-make is rushed and cursory. It is ineffective both as storytelling and as cinema--it's just nothing special, when it should have been one of the hallmarks of the film. Other aspects of the American version also come off as sloppy. For instance, Helen, the sister of Sydney (the main character) promises Sydney she will stick by her and help her as she recovers from surgery and learns to cope with her new-found ability to see. But then Helen inexplicably leaves town and we don't see her again until literally the last few seconds of the movie. I don't honestly recall what role the sister played in the Pang's version, but her character serves almost no purpose in the American version. This is just sloppy filmmaking. Bottom line, the Chinese version of The Eye is a pretty good little creepy horror flick (The Eye 2 is also quite good--a very unusual, low key, yet startling, ghost story), but the American version is a complete waste of time. It gets two stars instead of one only because Jessica Alba is so dang pretty.",1216080000,,1964,4.762463343108505

3090936,1,B0012KJ0CG,"Jessica Alba, I am not a fan. Asian remakes, they've become a little redundant and are definitely losing their quality as opposed to the actual films that are being remade. Stories that could be told so much better on film than they actually were because of restrictions such as rating or actors, please stop.

 So why did I even bother viewing The Eye? Because I hoped that there would be some saving grace, even a miniscule bit of saving grace. There was. The story is very interesting, and there are a few bits where it grabbed my attention. It didn't hold it for long. What mainly grabbed me was the story of the donor, and Alba's character to discover the donor's origins. I'm fans of Parker Posey and Alessandro Nivola, and to see them was nice although Parker Posey had maybe a mere 5-6 minutes of screen time. Visually, the film looked crisp and the colors used were great.

 Aside from that, there wasn't much to hold onto. The scares were minimal, and pretty noneffective. None of the characters aside from the donor and Alessandro's effected me. Most of the exposition fell flat. And I don't connect with Jessica Alba.

 In the string of these asian remakes, The Eye sits low on the list of them for me. It may sit at the bottom. As far as movies go, it doesn't sit anywhere on my list.",1215043200,3,1297,4.47457627118644

3090938,2,B0012KJ0CG,"I've talked to a number of people who have really ragged on actress Jessica Alba. They claim that she has no talent whatsoever, that she is nothing more than a pretty face. Well she is that but I think there is more beneath that is not seen often enough. Unfortunately it's also not seen here in THE EYE.

Alba stars as Sydney Wells, a blind concert violinists who is about to have her world completely changed. A donor has been found and replacement eye surgery puts her next in line to receive the gift of vision.

While we are first exposed to her world of sightlessness, as most movies concerning blind characters that suddenly see, the majority of the film deals with what happens after she receives sight. When she wakes in the hospital, she sees things. Since she's never seen before (or at least since she was a child) she's not sure if these images are normal or something else.

With the aid of Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandra Nivola), a doctor whose job it is to help patients like these adjusts to life with sight, Sydney discusses the visions she begins having. Not only is her focus coming in when it comes to those around her, she keeps seeing a dark figures as well. These later adjust to become more than mere shadow figures but horrific images that resemble more nightmares than dreams.

Determined to find out just what is causing these visions, Sydney decides to discover whose eyes she was given. The path of the film to this point is long and tedious. At times you feel like you'll never get here. But we do and that is when we find that Sydney's eyes came from a young Mexican woman who was branded as a witch by the local villagers.

It sis while on a trip to see her family and to get to know more about her that Sydney has her most vivid sight ever, seeing the images of hundreds being carried off by these dark characters she has been seeing. Can she discover just what it is that she is seeing, what it is she is supposed to do?

This movie offers very little in the way of entertainment. The plot seems to move along at a snails pace, feeling a bit redundant at times. The acting is fine and lacks no where, but when the script moves along like this, nothing can save it.

Having seen the original film that this was based on, 2002's Chinese film THE EYE, it was hard not to compare the two films. Fortunately it's been a while since I saw that one and I didn't feel like I was referring back and forth between the two. I will say that the original held my interests more and built suspense and mystery than this production though.

Hollywood seems to have given up on creating new horror, relying more on remakes of horror favorites (even FRIDAY THE 13TH is being remade as I write) and of oriental films like this one or THE GRUDGE and THE RING. Its fine to turn these foreign films into something more English speaking people will see, but if you choose to do so, why not honor the original instead of picking a few scarps of meat from the bones to be content with.

Yes, THE EYE is not a movie I could recommend whole heartedly to rent or purchase. But, as this article began, it does not mean that Jessica Alba is a terrible actress. Even some of the best actresses ever were hindered with bad scripts and bad directing. Let's just hope that Alba recovers from this one and move forward.",1214524800,,3319,4.366288492706645

3090953,2,B0012KJ0CG,"Most of what I think about ""The Eye"" has already been said in the other reviews shown here.

My gripe is mainly with Hollywood. They are completely OUT of fresh ideas for cinema. The well has run dry, and now they're trying to dip into the wells of their neighbors. What I mean by that is the latest trend of ripping off movie ideas from foreign cinema (much like Bollywood rips of Amercian films). ""The Eye"" is the American remake of a similar Asian film that apparently did well in the eastern markets, so it's gotta do well over here. Right?

Wrong.

What other cultures find amusing, scary, offensive, etc. is not necessarily how our culture feels about the same material (ever seen what Russians consider comedy? Not funny at all; but maybe that's just me).

Anywho, to understand what I mean, watch any of John Woo's Hong Kong action films (The Killer, Hard Boiled) and then watch his Hollywood features (Broken Arrow, Face/Off). There is no comparsion. Woo's Hong Kong films are gritty, real, down to earth, and in-your face. His Hollywood films are formulaic and prepackaged for the masses. That's what happens when Hollywood gets its greedy little nubs on something.

My whole point is, this film is predictable, formulaic, and rehashed. It's not something we haven't seen before. Jessica Alba does OK with her role, but nothing award-winning to say the least.

If you are in love with Alba and simply cannot resist looking at her (who could blame you?), then this movie is definitely for you.

If not, skip it and rent something else.",1213574400,11,1544,4.7388059701492535

3090958,3,B0012KJ0CG,"Over the past few years Hollywood has been in a remake craze; it seems every horror release is a remake or a sequel. The sad part is there are actually a lot of great remakes over the years, but due to the recent trend that is now often over-looked. The recent hash of remakes has mostly been poor with a few exceptions.

For some reason though the remakes of Asian flicks have been rather terrible; I'm not quite sure why, but these movies do not work in the States. The only remake of an Asian movie I thought was great was The Departed. Besides that they have all been rather bad with some being slightly below average. The remake of The Eye I found better than most of the Asian movie remakes, but with that said The Eye wasn't very good. If anything the movie was simply ok. It wasn't terrible by any means, but it just wasn't all that good.

The screenplay by Sebastian Gutierrez wasn't bad per se, but it's never interesting and that's the problem. The characters are rather boring and the story never fully works. It takes the basic idea of the original, but offers its own twist, which is a good thing. I hate remakes that are the same exact thing as the original. But the direction the movie goes in is just never interesting.

Directors David Moreau & Xavier Palud who have recently gotten some attention due to their French movie Them make their American movie debut. To be honest I didn't really care for Them; it takes the last 20-minutes of a slasher film and stretches it to an hour. Hear a noise and run away. But I did see some potential and had I liked the characters I probably would have liked the movie. While there was potential as filmmakers they sure as hell didn't come near with The Eye.

This is the typical ghost flick we've seen done over and over again. The original Eye wasn't the most original of movies. The basic style has been done plenty of times, but The Pang Brothers put their own twist on it, David Moreau & Xavier Palud never do that. It's really like every other remake of an Asian horror flick. If I didn't know any better I would think it was the same filmmakers each time out. But despite that The Eye is still better than most remakes of Asian horror flicks, which isn't saying much I suppose.

The original was a really eerie movie with some solid suspense. From the very start the Pang Brothers set a tone and maintain that through the whole movie. Moreau & Palud never come anywhere near doing that with their version. There are a few scenes that are just like the original, but never once are they effective. The biggest problem is the use of cheap jump scares.

Like I always say any filmmaker with a little talent can create a jump scare and more often than not we jump not because we're scared, but due to it being a simple reaction. The only time jump scares work is when they are set up prior to that. Moreau & Palud relied on the cheap jump scare tactic and it simply doesn't work. Though I will say the final act is actually quite well-done. While it does seem a bit rushed it's about the only scenes that are effective at all. By no means are they the most suspenseful, but do work well. But it's just as a whole The Eye just never fully works.

Jessica Alba really isn't a very good actress and let's be honest the main reason she's a high profile actress is due to her looks. There is no denying Alba is very nice to look at. I'll give her some credit here though. Alba manages to be more than just eye candy and actually delivers a pretty decent performance. This isn't a great performance, but it was actually pretty good, which surprised me.

In closing, The Eye isn't bad movie, but it's just never really interesting. There was potential, but never reaches it. The Eye makes for a decent time killer, but I'd stick with the original. Again The Eye isn't bad, but just never really interesting.",1212537600,2,3859,4.379888268156424
3090959,2,B0012KJ0CG,"I was a big fan of the unnerving and creepy Asian original, and was curious how well it would translate into an American film. When compared to the first, this version seems unusually light and devoid of suspense. Jessica Alba certainly has the star power and eye candy going for her as Sydney, the lead character who was tragically blinded at age five, but her range is limited and her ability to express anything beyond a mild surprise is annoyingly ineffective. When Sydney undergoes a cornea transplant and first sees light and shapes for the first time in decades, her response is tepid, at best, and nonchalant, leading one to believe the scene is little more than an afterthought so the movie can begin.

Once Sydney begins to regain her sight, she discovers she is able to see dead people and characters that snatch up the recently deceased and take them to whatever realm they belong (they do have a bit of shock value at first, but it fades, and there is no other explanation). This comes from the donor of the cornea, who herself was able to see the dead. Sydney remarkably and without any surprise or revelation regains her vision without any since of wonder whatsoever, leaving us absent any real sense of any newfound discovery. Her visions eventually lead her to Mexico, along with her therapist, where she confronts the source of her hauntings (I'll be intentionally vague, but it's not as interesting as it sounds). A gooey ending is followed by a bubble gum pop song while the credits roll, a testament to the movie's apparent desire to please thirteen year old girls and avoid any real chills or tension.

I remember explicitly a scene in the original film where the lead character is trapped in a moving elevator while a spirit slowly, and with a great sense of dread, hovers just out of her line of sight. The scene is shot with great skill, using camera angles, actress expressions, and lighting to effectively express a sense of terror. This film lacks any of that, and fails to truly create much tension between Sydney and her ghostly apparitions. While there is little CGI effects (no harm there) the use of light and shadows to create suspense is oddly absent after the first third of the film.

Disappointment sums up my thoughts on ""The Eye"" and I'll stick with a recommendation for the original. This acts more like a TV movie than it does a theater experience, which does make it appropriate for a rental.",1212537600,,2435,4.684579439252336

Synopsis: Sydney (played by our lovely Jessica Alba is a young, blind, violinist. She has been blind since childhood, after an accident with a firecrack. She is given the chance to see for the first time since childhood through a miraculous corneal transplant. As Sydney adjusts to the dizzy world of color and shapes she hasn't seen in years she's hunated by horrifying images and visons of death, it'self, dragging the 'doomed' away from the living world. On the brink of insanity, Sydney must discover whose eyes she has inherited, and what secret visions they have held.

However, I think this one did a better job of making the viewer really feel an emotional attachment for her and what she had to endure and some pretty good moments of feeling high tension.

3090962,5,B0012KJ0CG,"The moment this movie was announced, the Cruise/Wagner produced remake of the Hong Kong film, The Eye, was destined to be hated or loathed. However, unlike the film that comes afterward, Jumper, which was terrible in every aspect of the word, there's no merit to the low ratings this film's gotten (you know, other than personal opinion and disdain for Jessica Alba). I had the pleasure of watching the original ""EYE"" film before seeing the remake and I enjoyed it immensely.

I'm glad to say that, like the American remakes before this one, ---The Ring (Ringu) and The Grudge (Ju-on: The Grudge)--, The Eye is without a doubt the best adaptation of its original movie since the aforementioned films. Naturally, some changes are made to accommodate cultural differences and the current timeline of the world.

The story follows Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba), classical violinist, who has lived with an accident-caused blindness since she was just five years old. Now, nearly 20 nears later, she finally getting a transplant surgery that will restore her sight. At first, she is confused and disoriented, unable to understand if what she sees is ""real"" or not.

During her first night with her new eyes, her bedmate at the hospital dies, and Sydney, not understanding, watches her blurry figure being led away by someone else. During her stay, she also befriends a young girl named Alicia Milstone (Chloe Moretz), who is there undergoing surgery for a brain tumor.

As time goes on, Sydney's vision begins to clear up and she struggles to understand the new world around her. Her therapist, Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola), feels that her strange visions are her mind's way of interpreting what it was never able to before. However, when she starts to see more and more apparitions of the dearly departed, Sydney believes otherwise. Her sister, Helen Wells (Parker Posey) worries that the stress of her new experiences are beginning to get to Sydney, but Sydney persists that everything she is seeing real.

With no one to believe she is actually seeing the ghosts, the terrible visions of fire and death, Sydney struggles to retain her sanity as she attempts to decipher the mystery behind original owner of her eyes.

In terms of faithfulness, THE EYE is a near-recreation of its predecessor. Scenes mirror each other with only minor differences. The storyline is true to its source material, again, with only minor changes. For instance, instead of the donor being from Northern Thailand, she is from Mexico, but their fates are largely the same. Another nice touch is, like Keri Russell for August Rush, Jessica Alba took violin lessons for film (assuming I remember correctly). So whether or not she's actually playing on screen and not simply mimicking the movements while a soundtrack plays in the background, it's a nice bit of information to know. Granted, a lot of people will bi**h and moan about the way the movie ends, as its quite different from the original, but given the motivation Sydney uses to get the civilians to flee from danger, I can believe it (even though most in reality would laugh you off the bus and call you a lair).

The atmosphere of the movie a hardly scary, but it manages to weave a sense of unease, uncertainty (in concerns of Sydney's sanity), and tense moments when you least expect things to jump out at you. On technical aspects, the CGI used in the film blends well against the surrounding reality, especially near the end of the film. The ghosts, [Grim Reapers?], that usher spirits into the next world are more unsettling in appearance opposed to the originals. Which honestly begs the question as to whom they're actually working for -- especially since they ""don't like to be seen"".

The performances in this film are excellent. Jessica Alba especially shows off a surprisingly convincing dramatic side of her highly doubted skills as an actress. She excels in every scene she's in and more than proves her worth (to me anyhow). Parker Posey's performance Alba's moody sister, Helen, is entertaining for the short time she appears in the film; its made perfectly clear that her character blames herself still what happened to her sister.

Alessandro Nivola's Dr. Paul Faulkner, is about as likeable as Lawrence Chou's Dr. Wah in the beginning of the original film. Only, I didn't end up liking him at the end of this remake like I did the aforementioned character. Faulkner didn't strike me as that engaging of a character, though it could be because of Alessandro's deadpan performance.

Marco Beltrami`s, the to-go guy if you want a quick score for a horror movie, score is suitable for the movie, though its rarely noticeable at times (I was a little too engrossed in the movie to listen). Overall, THE EYE, I think, has managed to stay faithful the original source material while creating something new along the way. A highly recommended movie. --- [a 5 out of 5] -- [April 23, 2008].",1208908800,7,4935,4.892344497607655
3090963,4,B0012KJ0CG,"Jessica Alba plays Sydney Wells, who went blind at the age of seven as a result of a firecracker accident with her sister. I'll only mention this as an interjection, because that's how it felt in the movie, but Parker Posie is a horrible actress, was completely forgettable, and may actually have some sort of sense deprivation similar to the star character in this movie. Despite Posie's black-hole of suck ""acting"" style, Jessica Alba manages to carry every scene with her incredible beauty and acting ability.

Despite the disability, Wells has moved on well enough in life to be a celebrated violinist, living successfully in the big city at a swanky condo expensive enough to have an elevator employee. Somehow she doesn't have a boyfriend or love interest; so she can devote most of her time to her career, being nice, and listening to her sister harp (pun intended) on her about getting cornea transplants.

After getting the surgery, she is sent to a specialist, of what I have no idea. However, Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola) is an eye specialist that helps cornea transplant recipients readjust to their new sight, but he does so in the most callous manner possible, without even the slightest regard for the psychological trauma someone may experience when gaining one of the five senses they've lived without their entire adult life. His approach is essentially the equivalent of telling someone with a torn hamstring to rub some dirt on it and get back in the game. The fact that he has the perpetual George Michael five-o'clock shadow, and nearly no compassion adds little credibility to his portrayal as a doctor.

Along with Sydney's new-found vision, she also begins to see abnormalities (eerie ghosts, spooky images, blurry suspicions, etc.). She seems to have the ability to see events in the past, events in the future, as well as people making their after-life transition. Not only that, but she also begins having visions of her surroundings changing, and gray, creepy apparitions of some kind acting as escorts to the aforementioned recently deceased. One can only assume they are escorts towards a purgatory of some sort; otherwise, there is no reason to make the apparitions evil, especially when escorting off innocent, out-going, little girls with terminal brain cancer.

The plot moves along when Sydney find out the reflection she sees is of a different woman, and from there she must find out who this woman is, and why she wants from Sydney. (This scene reminded me of Scott Bakula's character in the old TV show Quantum Leap, except the reflections were very rarely as attractive) She makes the connection around this time and realizes all the visions have to do with her eye donor.

The conclusion comes about when Sydney inevitably avenges the death of her donor by completing an altruistic deed left unfinished. Lives are saved, the evil escort spirits are thwarted, and the donor's soul can rest in one of the most predictable endings in movie history.

In the perpetual stream of Japanese horror flicks made into mediocre Hollywood productions, this is nothing more than a typical translation. And, just like the commanalities in language translation, this movie comes across about as scary as many of the Engrish signs I've seen; it may work in Japan, but in America it comes across as somewhat silly and contrived...but it's still the best translation yet, because Jessica Alba takes it to the next level.",1206835200,2,3451,4.972270363951473
3090964,3,B0012KJ0CG,"This is a spoiler-free review of ""The Eye.""

If you're looking for a few decent thrills and a competently made horror film in the ""Sixth Sense"" subgenre, you might want to check out ""The Eye."" I saw this recently with almost no expectations after reading some incredibly harsh reviews. I was surprised at how enjoyable it was, and how it avoided what could have been some exceptionally heavy-handed social commentary. No, this isn't an especially original horror film, and it isn't particularly gory or edgy. But it's certainly gripping enough for me to recommend it, and I hope it gains a larger audience on DVD.

Jessica Alba plays a blind violinist who receives a corneal transplant and almost immediately starts seeing supernatural visions. While some of them reminded me of the typical Asian oddball ghosts we've seen recently, others reminded me more of creatures from ""Pan's Labyrinth."" Regardless, most of them were creepy. Jessica Alba gives her best performance since ""Dark Angel"" in this movie (I've been very critical of practically every film she's done) and it's to her credit that the movie works as well as it does. She channels the same spirit of alienation that she did as Max on ""Dark Angel"" and it's hard not to have sympathy for a character who is as isolated as she is by the middle third of the film. As the only A-list talent in the film, everything is on Jessica's shoulders and she rises to the occassion.

Most of the supporting characters aren't fleshed out very well, suggesting that either whole reels were left in the editing room or the filmmakers were trying to capture the sketchy nature of ""Carnival of Souls"" (which portions of ""The Eye"" strongly resemble). This helps prevent ""The Eye"" from ever becoming a great film but as I've stated before, it's a solid nonpretentious horror flick.",1205020800,,1823,4.855305466237942
3090965,3,B0012KJ0CG,"This movie isn't half as awful as I expected. At least, there's an odd mix of really bad parts and really good parts.

Of course, some things in this movie are pretty ridiculous. For example, the character of her therapist (the main character after Alba's) seems completely unprofessional and unconvincing, and the relationship between them is confusingly unrealistic. And it was really annoying how the ghosts she saw would sort of calmly drift away into the afterlife or wander off or something, and then for no apparent reason other than to shock the audience they'd suddenly jump out in front of her and go ""boo."" Why? Thank goodness they stopped doing that after the first twenty minutes or so.

But some of this movie was actually kind of neat. The parts where she sees scary things but can hardly make them out through her post-surgery blurry-vision, rendered in first person for the audience to see, are very creepy. Alba's character seems to have no friends to turn to for help except her therapist, which gives the movie an odd atmosphere of desperation and loneliness. And the overall plot is basically exciting. The conclusion, thank goodness, is NOT one of those irritating nonsensical shock-value-only twists that most other films inspired by Chinese/Japanese horror movies have.

So... seeing this really wasn't a total waste of nine dollars.",1203206400,,1357,5.022222222222222
3090966,2,B0012KJ0CG,"The Eye (David Moreau and Xavier Palud, 2008)

Okay, I knew what I was getting into with this one. No one can do the Pang Brothers like the Pang Brothers can do the Pang Brothers. I think I went to see it just to find out how badly Hollywood (who had the Pang Brothers for one film, the highly underrated The Messengers, then cast them back into the waters of Hong Kong) would mangle the brilliant original. While it wasn't a total loss, it was the kind of carnage you have to slow down to take a look at.

The story is the same: a young violinist, Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba), who was struck blind at the age of five, receives a cornea transplant. All is well and good, except that she starts having visions that she soon realizes are the memories of the donor, a Mexican woman (Fernanda Romero) who committed suicide. (Unlike in the original, this isn't a spoiler; we see her suicide in the opening shot.) Wells becomes convinced she has to go to Mexico and fins out all she can about the donor, against the advice of her doctor, Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola), who, while finding her frustrating, is attracted to her. (Well, it's Jessica Alba, wouldn't you be?)

As usual, the butchering could have been avoided had anyone decided on a shot-by-shot remake instead of watering down everything that made the original great. (Those who have seen the original will probably be groaning at the film's climax, which is grossly redone.) There are a few scenes here that do stand out, as when Wells ducks into the Chinese restaurant, but a few memorable scenes are a far cry from a good movie. Save yourself a few bucks and rent the superior original film instead. **",1202774400,,1665,4.543333333333333
3090967,3,B0012KJ0CG,"The Eye is a suspense drama dealing with the paranormal.  The story line is a cross between the Sixth Sense&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense-Collector-s-Edition-Series/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)</a>&nbsp;and Deja Vu&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deja-Vu/dp/B00005JPD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deja Vu</a>.  While this won't be an Oscar contender, it is much better than advertised and worth the price of admission.

The Story

Movies about paranormal or psychic activities usually require you to suspend disbelief.  The story requires more stretch than usual because Jessica Alba's character plays a wealthy, good looking professional violinist who is somehow still a single loner.  When her eye surgery (cornea transplant) has her seeing ghosts, the stretches in the plotline seem tame by comparison.

The movie mainly consists of her trying to find out who her donor was and why she's seeing strange things.  There's plenty of shock images of specters that scream across the screen to startle you.  Still, this isn't exactly a ""horror"" movie and there's no real gore to speak of.  The movie uses the vague uncertainty of her situation to make you feel more dread than fear.

The story line has a ""surprise ending"" that is done well enough.  It's clear that the story was changed many times, perhaps at the expense of the movie.  But in the end, it wraps up nicely enough as long as you don't over-analyze it.

Acting and Direction

As far as acting is concerned, Alba does a much better job than the critics will ever give her credit for.  In fact, her performance makes this movie watchable.  Considering some of the dialogue she has to work with, she does an admirable job.

Her supporting cast is used less effectively.  The director decided to use Alessandro Nivola (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-Laid-Plans/dp/630571486X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best Laid Plans</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laurel-Canyon/dp/B00009MEKN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laurel Canyon</a>), as the doctor, in a deadpan way that neither showcases his acting skills nor aids in plot development.  And Parker Posey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broken-English/dp/B000OU082G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broken English</a>)is thrown in as the sister, showing up only enough to get a paycheck.

Effects and Cinematography

Special effects are good though not groundbreaking.  There is some nice CG aided photography in the movie to show slow motion stills.  It's used well, and it's clear that some technically strong people worked on the shooting and editing of this movie.  Still, audiences have come to expect so much in terms of special effects that this movie will not leave people impressed.

Conclusion

Could the story have been much better?  Yes.  Could the acting and direction been improved?  Absolutely.  Still, this is a fun movie that's worth seeing in the theatre and will appeal to a wide audience of Alba fans from her sci-fi beginnings&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Angel-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JLJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Angel - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;to her more recent role in Sin City&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B00005JNTX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>.  In fact, those into the paranormal will find enough to keep them interested.

The timing of this movie was the main error.  It was released in the dead of winter when it's very difficult to get traction for movies like this.  I hope that the DVD will include enough special features to be worth a buy.

3090968,1,B0012KJ0CG,"The Eye, starring(and I use that term loosely) one Jessica Alba is another chapter in a seemingly endless series of Japanese based suspense/horror piece ripoffs, purpetrated on viewers by a Hollywood that simlply seems to have run out of ideas as well as conscience.

The premise is not altogether horrible for a film of this genre.  But in the hands of the Hollywood machine, my hopes for even a passable suspense tale were dashed quickly.

Alba, who is cast grossly out of her acting range, plays a woman in her twenties who was blinded as a child.  Predicatably she lives alone despite being gourgeous and financially well off.  She is also pathetically naive despite living in a big city.  But worst of all is that she is a first class concert musician.  Because all blind characters in Hollywood are musical geniuses right?  (Why did she have to be first chair violin?  Wouldn't it have made her a more real and interesting character if she was say, third chair and struggling just to stay in the orchestra?)  But I digress.

After a corneal transplant, her vision is restored.  Soon after the surgery, she begins seeing images that aren't there.  Unfortunately for the audience, these visions are mostly indistinghishable so we aren't ever really sure what we're supposed to be afraid of.  And it occurred to me very early in the film that there is a fundamental flaw in the way this tale is told.  The movie makes no bones about the fact that, while these visions portend to some event in the past or future, what Alba sees at that moment is nothing more than a ""vision"" and not actually a real event.  Since we know these sequences aren't real when we see them, there is no jeopardy or danger and thus, no reason for us to be frightened.  This destroys any chance to generate tension!  How could a filmmaker not know this?

The Eye plods along with one ho-hum ""vision"" sequence after another, never really advancing the plot much.  You are left bored waiting for something...anything to happen of interest in the film.  Then out of nowhere the final act mercifully begins to bring the story to resolution.  There is a particularly ridiculous scene late in the film that sums up how bad a job the director did in this film.  The scene is intended to be emotional and dramatic but it actually drew laughter in the theater when it played.  (Incidentally, there were several instances of unintended laughter during this film which should be a sign of just how bad this one is.)  Anyway, Alba is on the floor of a basement in some slum in Mexico.  She is holding the girl who was her cornea donor.  (Even though she's already dead and buried and Alba is the only one who can see her.)  Inexplicably, the already dead girl dies...again in her arms.  Huh?  The film then cuts to a shot of Alba on the floor miming as if she's holding someone, meaning her arms are empty.  The scene is so bad it is truly comical.  The entire theater erupted in laughter when this shot came on.  At that moment I realized the value of test screenings.  Anyway, don't say you weren't warned.  If you see The Eye, it will make you wish you clawed yours out.",1201910400,7,3138,4.562724014336918
3090969,3,B0012KJ0CG,"I hate it when a supernatural thriller makes me question things about the plot, namely its plausibility. ""The Eye"" is a film like that, and that's too bad because I really wanted to immerse myself in the thrills and chills without focusing on the specifics. Yes, this movie is creepy and tense, but it's also completely unbelievable, from the characterizations to the plot details to the ending, which is so ridiculous and contrived that I almost felt cheated. Pretty much the only believable part of the story is the supernatural element, which involves the transplanted eyes of a formerly blind woman seeing horrible things. It probably doesn't matter that I've never seen the Chinese film this is based on, or even that I have no idea how a medical procedure like a corneal transplant really works; what does matter is that ""The Eye"" succeeds in being frightening but fails at telling a good story.

Jessica Alba plays Sydney Wells, a concert violinist who went blind at age five because of an incident with firecrackers. Her sister, Helen (Parker Posey), feeling responsible for Sydney's condition, has her undergo a corneal transplant. Soon enough, Sydney is lying in a hospital recovery room with bandages over her eyes; when removed, she sees a world of blurred images and undefined shapes, which is normal so soon after such a procedure. But then she begins to see things that aren't normal, ugly, gray-skinned things that disappear and reappear at will. As her vision gets clearer, she soon discovers that they serve as postmortem escorts, leading ghosts away from their bodies and into another realm. Where they go and why they do this is never explained, but I guess it doesn't matter since they were effective.

Not so effective are the circumstances surrounding a series of visions. As she struggles to cope with newfound eyesight, Sydney's life is plagued by recurring nightmares and ghostly visitations, all of which incrementally reveal unfamiliar people and places. They all seem to have something to do with a devastating fire and the deaths of many people, but it's unclear as to what they mean or why she's seeing it. She eventually realizes that it has something to do with the eye donor, but any attempts at extracting information are flatly rejected. It's confidential, they say. They only one willing to help is her therapist, Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola), a man I neither believed in nor cared about. A character this out of place shouldn't be so quick to point out all of the ways Sydney will have trouble adjusting; he says that because she's been dependant on her other senses for so long, she won't know how to handle what she sees. This may be true, but he certainly wasn't able to convince me.

The search for the donor leads Sydney and Paul into Mexico, and this is pretty much where the film is at its worst. It isn't until then we learn that Paul is fluent in Spanish, which isn't unrealistic so much as it's convenient for the plot, as is the fact that the first real character they meet is fluent in English. I can't really describe this part without being annoyingly vague, so let us leave it at the fact that Sydney has been called there for something directly related to the visions she's been having.

This is the kind of plot that sounds decent enough on paper but doesn't quite measure up on the big screen. Much like the sequence in Mexico, most of ""The Eye"" is dependent on convenience, whether or not it's plausible. Sydney's casual attitude towards her new eyesight is downright maddening, as is the ease with which she navigates streets, hallways, stairs, and elevators. For someone used to doing all this blindly, she behaves as if she has been able to see her whole life. The character development is painfully lacking, especially when it comes to side characters that seem important but ultimately contribute nothing. Take, for example, Alicia Millstone (Chloe Moretz), a nine-and-a-half year old cancer patient living in the hospital: she seems desperate to be friends with Sydney, so much so that she enters Sydney's room whenever she feels like it and offers herself as a kind-hearted soul. But why does she feel so connected? Why does she care at all, considering her own struggles? This character was the weakest of the film, more so than the unbelievable Paul Faulkner.

One aspect of the film I did like related to Sydney's mirror image. When she fails to recognize herself in a picture taken by Helen, she realizes that her reflection is in fact not her own, but that of the donor. How psychological. How symbolic. How jaw-droppingly unnerving. Of course, it's nothing more than one shocking moment--the rest of the film is nowhere near as effective in terms of drawing the audience in. Had the story been halfway as good as it sounded, the film could have been something more. It would be too much to say that ""The Eye"" is a bad film, but it would be untrue to say that it worked, and I say this because it wanted to be more than just a run of the mill supernatural thriller. But when a film about sight is bookended by voiceover narrations that say you shouldn't trust your eyes, a supernatural thriller is the best it's ever going to be.",1201824000,10,5207,4.761904761904762
3325322,1,B0012KJ0CG,"Ahem, let me just see if I got this right. This is a US remake of a recent Japanese horror film, helmed by a duo of... French directors, with Jessica Alba as the main blind (!) character? And, like ""The Grudge 2"", ""The Ring 2"" and numerous other Hollywood remakes of mid-grade J-horror, it hasn't been screened for critics... Hmmm. Maybe one shouldn't expect a masterpiece here.
It's not. Not by a long stretch. Aside from a few nice visual touches here and there, the film is poorly directed, acted, edited, scripted, lit - and worst of all, it never approaches even the mediocre original's (directed by the Oxide brothers) ability to raise chills.
I would go into intricate plot details, but let's face it - if you're going to watch it, you don't want me to spoil whatever flimsy attempts at twists this film makes. And if you're not going to watch it (I predict this will be the majority), you won't be bothered to read this review.
So I'll take the rest of my time trying to convince those of you still reading NOT to watch this film.
I mean, name ONE decent Jessica Alba performance. (""Sin City"" doesn't count - all she does in it is dance.) She has never been, and never will be a contender for an Oscar nomination - unless she plays a paralyzed deaf mute with a bandaged face. She's sexy, but as an actress leaves a lot to be desired.
Why would you want to go watch ""The Eye"", when such films as ""No Country for Old Men"", ""Michael Clayton"", ""There Will Be Blood"", and, if you're looking for shocks, ""Cloverfield"", are playing in theaters? Trust me, you've seen it all before: the uncanny hazy visions, darkly lit atmospheric corridors, eerie noises and a predictable finish. This is clearly a case of ""let's hire some fresh European directors to remake some film for a quick buck."" Hopefully, there won't be any bucks.
Go watch the original Japanese version instead - while no classic by a stretch, it's  more entertaining than this dreck. Or, even better, go see what the directors are capable of in their far superior debut feature ""Them"", a 75-minute sustained terror trip, and let this shallow, pointless feature become a flop.
Maybe then they'll stop making 'em.",1201824000,6,2174,4.603092783505154

And like so many remakes, it belly-flops into forgettable mediocrity -- partly due to Alba's awkward two-expression acting, and partly because co-directors David Moreau and Xavier Palud... simply do not have the indefinable skill that makes a horror director good.

After many years of blindness, Sydney (Alba) is given a corneal transplant that finally restores her sight. Everything is going beautifully after the transplant, although Sydney is a little bewildered. Then she starts seeing things that she shouldn't -- ghosts who repeat what they did before they died, people who have just expired, and dark shadows that escort them away. Oh, and fire. She keeps seeing fire.

Unsurprisingly, her friends and doctors think that she's having some sort of weird reaction to all the new input coming into her brain, but Sydney knows that her new corneas have somehow given her supernatural powers. So she begins investigating the woman whose corneas she currently has, hoping to bring peace to her soul.

I'd like to mention that I am NOT one of those hipsterish people who pretend that all American remakes are automatically bad or inferior to the original, nor do I labor under the provincial delusion that Hollywood is the only movie industry that remakes stuff from other countries. In fact, the American ""The Eye"" isn't even the first remake of this story -- there was a 2005 remake over in India.

So I can say without prejudice that this movie is terrible. To the credit of Palud and Moreau, they try painfully hard to stick to the Hong-Kong movie -- almost every scene is identical, and some of the spooky moments are copied shot-by shot.

But there's something... missing. It's difficult to exactly put your finger on what is wrong with the movie, but it simply is not scary -- there are things that should be skin-crawlingly creepy (Sydney realizing that her reflection is not her face) that just feel vaguely dull. Some of this also comes from the music, which tends to be bland and tensionless, even during dramatic or scary scenes.

Also, Jessica Alba. She is possibly the worst choice possible for a horror movie. This woman has two facial expressions, and neither one of them is fear -- so whenever Sydney is horrified or frightened, Alba just scuttles around looking vaguely displeased.

And this is what truly kills ""The Eye."" There are countless scenes that strain pathetically to be frightening, and almost are able to be. Consider when Sydney is trapped in an elevator with the levitating, slowly-approaching ghost of a dead man... and Alba just stands in a corner making ""scared"" noises, aperformance that is embarrassing to watch. This movie needed Sarah Michelle Gellar or Jessica Chastain instead of.... this.

And you get the sense that none of the other actors are really invested in this. Alessandro Nivola seems like he's sleepwalking through his role as the kindly doctor, and his chemistry with Alba is so nonexistent that you're left wondering why he'll risk his career to help her. And Parker Posey's role is so empty and flat that I literally did not notice that she was in the movie until it was halfway over.

""The Eye"" tries its hardest to be like the movie it remakes, but the subtle spookiness of the Brothers Pang is missing. The scariest thing is how hideously unconvincing Jessica Alba's performance is.",1400716800,2,3559,4.906821963394343

This is the work of vandals, not filmmakers!  They didn't get anything right.  Where the original was poetic and touching, this sham of a remake was noisy, brash, and not a little stupid.  It didn't help that lead actress went from Wonder Woman to an overwrought neurotic ninny in the blink of an eye.  (Not for nothing was Jessica Alba nominated for a Razzie for worst actress of the year.)  Her doctor (misplayed by Alessandro Nivola) wasn't much better.  Nivola managed to turn his sympathetic, caring character into a nasty, angry skeptic!  It defeated the whole purpose of their relationship.

3325382,2,B0012KJ0CG,"HUGE SPOILER ALERT!!! ~ ~ ~ Do Not Read This Review If You Have Not Seen The Movie!!!

I stumbled upon this movie on cable TV having not seen it from the beginning. My first thought was this effort is clearly an EYE CANDY movie for Jessica Alba fans because she is young and pretty and apparently single, ""in this movie."" But on the whole, I have 10 good reasons to support the title of this review:

Check out what we are treated to in THE EYE:

[1] SCREAM: The leading lady, Jessica Alba, is named ""Sydney,"" just like back in 1996 when we saw Neve Campbell play the role of ""Sidney Prescott.""

[2] CARNIVAL OF SOULS, HALLOWEEN, FUNHOUSE, TOURIST TRAP, THE FOG, THE RING, HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES and very many other classic ""horror"" movies ALL have a young, pretty, single girl as THE leading attraction.

[3] A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET: We have the REAL cut on the arm that comes out of a dreamlike sequence ~ AND ~ The idea of showing a pretty young girl in a nightgown in a darkened public hallway.

[4] THE EXORCIST: The quick-flash use of what some people call ""Subliminal Suggestion"" occurs right before Jessica Alba notices the cuts on her arm ~ just like the dream sequence sufferd by Damien Karras in THE EXORCIST.

[5] PSYCHO: Alba takes a shower and we see her naked feet step onto the floor and we also see a shower curtain in the sequence . . . at one point in the movie, Alba looked like the little girl in THE RING. There were also some camera techniques used that reminded me of THE RING.

[6] POLTERGEIST: There is the ""eyeball mirror"" moment with Alba which reminds me of the guy in the bathroom in that chilling sequence from the 1980's classic.

[7] THE EVIL DEAD: The trap door in the floor idea.

[8] CARNIVAL OF SOULS: Alba and that guy with the glasses are driving along and you see the moon through the far passenger window ~ a visual technique used in CARNIVAL OF SOULS.

[9] The 1975 novel AUDREY ROSE: The girl and the flames idea. ( . . . and/or Stephen King's FIRESTARTER?)

[10] SPEED: The bomb on the bus idea.

So you see, this movie was entirely DESIGNED to brainwash the viewer into thinking it is a good movie via the success of past Hollywood efforts ~ ~ ~ THERE IS NOTHING NEW HERE.

One physical body walking through another physical body has been done before, the use of a linguistic translator to heighten mystery or suspense has been used before; really, it just goes on and on and on.

In the end, I belive it might have been (or perhaps could still be?) an interesting choice to attempt this effort in the form of a story by classic British horror novelist Graham Masterton ~ though that idea merely describes my silly little fantasy version upon the matter, and that is all.

Enjoy the movie!  (But why buy the DVD? Jessica Alba did a good job of acting in a flimsy and weak screenplay.)",1342224000,,2831,4.372137404580153

3325385,5,B0012KJ0CG,"While alot of people seem to be down on this American remake of 'The Eye', I think that it was very well done.  I think the movie itself was a pretty good portrayal of the original movie.  I feel that this movie was an excellent remake and is also one of the few remakes that is as good if not better than the original.  American cinema is famous for destroying J-Horror movies (think One Missed Call or Shutter), but this movie is an excellent compliment to the original.

I like that the director did not feel the need to bring the characters to Asia to get the true feel of the original.  I think it was a great choice using an LA and Mexico story line, instead of making it an exchange student in Japan botch job like the Grudge 2.  You definately have a few creepy scenes in here, but overall I think the movie is pretty well done.  I also think Jessica Alba plays her part very well, however I do not like her male doctor at all.

I was glad and astonded that they used the creepy old man, and I though the addition of the ghostly little kid was cool too! (have you seen my report card?)  Finally, the end was a perfect North American compliment to the original ending, and paid homage to the original movie while still retaining its own originality.

I definately recommend this movie, you should go and check it out.  Definately get the original and this one and draw your own conclusions.",1308787200,,1397,4.314176245210728

3325390,3,B0012KJ0CG,"If you've already watched the HK original of ""The Eye"", i.e. ""Jian Gui"", then you may want to skip this as the original is much creepier and more credibly acted than this remake. Jessica Alba plays the role of blind concert violinist Sydney Wells who receives a corneal transplant that allows her to see again (she lost her eyesight in a freak childhood accident). Trouble is, she sees more than she wants to as the transplant enables her to 'see' the supernatural world around her where the recently dead are escorted to the other side by supernatural beings, restless souls haunt their former homes, etc.

It doesn't take too long before Sydney realizes there is more to her 'gift' and that she needs to find out the story of the donor in order to put an end to her own torment. She is aided by a psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola). The action is fast-paced but I felt that the scary scenes were less credibly set up than in the original HK movie. It almost seems comical the way Sydney experiences one supernatural jolt after another. The effects were slick but I felt there was too much CGI and overly loud sound effects which did nothing to increase the spooky factor.

The original movie had lots of atmosphere and genuinely creepy moments that had me practically jumping out of my seat (there's one scene in the original where the main character is taking a calligraphy lesson and a spirit literally attacks her out of nowhere for sitting in the departed soul's seat - very scary and nicely executed). Such scenes are lacking in this movie, and those that are meant to scare viewers fail to do so.

Alba plays her role quite well, but it is not an extraordinary performance (I felt the HK actress was amazing and much more credible in the original). Nivola is ok as eye candy but not much else. Final verdict - watch the original if you can, it's a much more rewarding viewing experience, but if you absolutely can't stand a subtitled movie, then this serves as an OK substitute.",1282608000,,2003,4.605042016806722

3325396,4,B0012KJ0CG,"The Eye starts off rather boring, and definitely NOT scary. However, after you get by the first 30 minutes, the unexplainable scares Jessica Alba's character begins to see really get going and *this* is when the story takes off.

The story begins with Jessica's character portraying a blind woman, but soon she gets surgery that allows her to see. The movie does a great job allowing Jessica's character development to build, and making it believable that we really ARE seeing someone learn to use their eyes after years of not being able to see at all.  Good detail here.

As soon as her vision gets settled in, she starts seeing dark, ghostly figures that definitely aren't friendly by any stretch of the imagination.

She soon realizes that whenever she sees these ghostly figures, she is seeing them because a death has taken place recently around the area, and these ghosts have come to take away people who have died recently.

Sometimes the scares are truly disturbing, such as the one involving a little kid who kept asking her if she'd seen his report card. That part was a bit funny, because it's easy to see WHY his report card was so bad- he spends all day hanging around the hotel hallways, haha.

However, the kid actually died, and when Jessica discovers this, any future encounter with the boy will only result in something horrifying... but I won't spoil what actually happens.

Another very freaky part is when she actually walks *through* another woman while walking across the street.  You will see what's up with this scene after you get used to the storyline.

Those aren't the only dead people she sees either- she sees plenty of other people too.  Wait until you see what happens whenever she looks at a mirror.

The movie does a terrific job keeping the ghostly figures few and far between, allowing tension to build, and allowing us to appreciate the horror aspect when it unfolds.

A great movie, but please, take time to get used to a slow-moving storyline in the beginning, and you will probably be satisfied with the film by the conclusion.",1265414400,,2070,4.735376044568246

""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"". Evidently they did not learn their lesson as now we have ""The Eye"" a cheep remake of the Hong Kong film ""Jian Gui"". When will they ever learn?

Yes it is the standard formula artist gets a new set of eyes that contain the memory of the donor. Now she sees dead people and must decipher the reason.

This has been done a lot better many times before. And I am sure this is not the last time. The film passes time but has no great insight.

3325400,5,B0012KJ0CG,"Horror films can be great even if they are not terrifying.  ""The Eye"" happens to be one of those films.  The film won't necessarily scare the audience, but with a deep enough story, and a good plot line with likable characters, the film can definitely make for an exciting viewing time, despite the anti-climatic ending.  Personally, I believe that this film is highly under-appreciated.

The story revolves around a young woman named Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) who has been blind the majority of her life.  Years in darkness have taught her to utilize her other senses in order to sustain a well organized life.  The opening scenes of the film show the audience that Sydney has not only overcome her handicap of visual impairment, but she is quite comfortable with it as well.  Living the life of a well known concert violinist, Sydney appears to be quite content with her lifestyle.  Until the day she decides to try out a new medical procedure that promises to restore her eyesight.

In an attempt to regain her eyesight that she lost as a child, Sydney (Alba) goes through with corneal transplant surgery.  She awakes in a dark hospital bedroom.  She cannot see too clearly at the moment, her vision impaired with blurry images.  This turns out to be the least of her worries.  Immediately after waking up in her hospital room, Sydney sees the image of an elderly woman who is being taken away by a dark shadowy figure.  The initial appearance of the ghost is well timed, allowing a decent shock for the viewer, but not one that is good enough to actually scare them either.

Slowly, she begins to see more ghostly images, ranging from a local coffee shop, to her own apartment complex.  These images cause Sydney to seek help from an eye specialist, Dr. Paul Faulkner, who promised to teach Sydney how to readjust to the sense of sight.  Upon telling Paul that she has been seeing strange images, Paul simply tells Sydney that she is still adjusting to her new sense.  What he doesn't know is that the images are real, and appear to be occurring more frequently.  As it turns out, Sydney received the eyes from a dead woman who also was capable of seeing ""ghosts"".  The woman committed suicide after tormenting images haunting her night and day turned the small Mexican village where she resided against her.

I find the story to be quite compelling and the characters are very easy to relate to.  The ending was nothing spectacular, and may have been a little too anti-climatic to garner enough praise.  The film may leave some viewers searching for more details, but it ends too abruptly to allow for further insight.  The pacing is done quite nicely, and the development of the plot proceeds quite smoothly, allowing the audience to get to know the characters better.  The movie has some tense scenes in it, mainly at the hospital after the initial images begin to occur, but the scary factor dwindles with time and the movie becomes more of a ""mystery"" film than a horror one.  Being one of Jessica Alba's biggest roles in a movie, I believe she did an excellent job of portraying the torment that she was going through.  The lighting of the film and the camera techniques added to the overall ambiance that generated the feeling of tension when needed.  The movie was not ""scary"" but was instead ""suspenseful"" and well developed, in my personal opinion.  If you're a fan of Jessica Alba (like me) or of horror films, you really can't go wrong with adding ""The Eye"" to your collection, just don't expect it to make you sleep with the lights on.",1258588800,3,3554,4.677938808373591

The idea that a body had an inherant separate ""identity"" or even ""Spirituality"" was not so far-fetched, since Jeff Fahey ( BODY PARTS, I think thats the guy, same fellow as in LAWN MOWER MAN ) gave such a powerful performance, although the sequel to LAWN MOWER MAN was less than Stellar and lost the plot.
Anyways, Since I liked the lead characters, and I definitely liked Rachel Ticotin ( After Her appearance in  TOTAL RECALL well, who would not) and wanted to see what she would do. I was happy to see where they took the film THE EYE that I had already seen in the original.
I definitely suspect that a more direct translation would not have worked, or even a dub, even though the original gave more detail concerning the witch and had a cute lead, as well as having some spooky wraiths;
The Sound on this DVD version was also very spooky. I would have liked some extras, but I guess that was too much to ask, anyways, it was a good shot at the original since the concepts are very hard to translate.

I don't completely know what the differences are between the 2 versions, but I will say that while this movie version is considerably better written, better acted, and possessing a little more character development than the original it still just proves way too bland. It's a bitter enough pill that gorgeous and incredibly hot Jessica Alba never gets naked EVER nor does she have any love interest in the movie. But to make matters worse the story was this same bland plot with a beautiful blind violinist girl getting to see again from a cornea transplant only to have visions of her dark past. I mean what it is that anybody thought would be interesting about a dull plotline like that is beyond me! And it still ends the same stupid way as the original. I won't give away what the ending was that much but only I will say that after Jessica Alba saves the people from a gas tanker explosion during a traffic jam why then wouldn't she instead be getting used to seeing as well as having no further flashbacks about the donors incident in the past. That would have been a better turn out. If you read my other review for the original the said ""incident"" is not any different really.

3325418,2,B0012KJ0CG,"Jessica Alba is Sydney Wells, a concert violinist who has recently received an eye transplant. The operation is a success, but soon she starts seeing scary things that other people cannot see. Could it be that her new eyes are deceiving her, or is she just imagining things?

The film's premise itself is fairly interesting, but ""The Eye"" fails to really interest us because of its derivative story and the lack of scare. It was a bit shocking for me to see the director team David Moreau and Xavier Palud, responsible for their brilliant film ""Them,"" using so many familiar tricks of horrors like sudden big sound or shadowy figure moving around.

The 2002 Hong Kong film (directed by the Pang brothers), upon which this new version is based, made a good use of the premise against the background of the Asian locations and culture. It may not be the greatest horror film (or maybe I should not call it a horror as the story was more about the characters - the recipient and the donor - than about the terrors they experience), but the direction was imaginative and Angelica Lee's acting as the tormented heroine was splendid. Unfortunately Jessica Alba's performances as the terrified heroine is not as good as Lee's and supports including Alessandro Nivola and Parker Posey are not very memorable.

As you know, films with stories related to ""the second sight"" are nothing new (remember ""The Eyes of Laura Mars""? or how about ""Blink""?) To create a truly engaging film, however, you need something more, something that makes the whole film more suspenseful or some clever twist as in ""The Dead Zone"" or, naturally, ""The Sixth Sense.""

3325420,2,B0012KJ0CG,"In ""The Eye,"" a remake of a Chinese movie from 2002, Jessica Alba plays a blind woman who gets her sight back thanks to a successful cornea transplant.  The only hitch is that with her new eyes - which were donated by a young lady with psychic powers - comes the unasked-for ability to see into the spirit world and predict the future.

""The Eye"" might have been an interesting film had it focused solely on how a once-blind girl learns to adjust to life in a suddenly sighted world.  Instead, we're subjected to an inane, gimmicky thriller in which the heroine improbably manages to run across either a dead person or someone doomed to die just about every time she turns a corner.

There's no end of point-of-view shots in which ghouls jump out and yell ""Boo!"" at the audience, but the whole thing is about as scary as a youngster dressed in a bedsheet doing the same thing on Halloween.",1223769600,,889,4.469135802469136
3325421,3,B0012KJ0CG,"There's always room for one more thriller to slide a chill or two through the cracks around our casements. I'm not sure though that ""The Eye"" quite does the job. It's not too bad, but it's too much of a re-tread.

It might remind the viewer of any number of 1950's drive-in horror flicks that featured reanimated body parts. There was ""The Hand,"" the ""Head,"" and indeed a host of either transplanted or disembodied eyes with minds of their own. So the idea that a pair of transplanted eyes can see things that their new owner never saw - is an old one.

Then this film also recycles a lot of its special effects from ""The Grudge"" and ""The Ring"" - right down to specifics, including a pair of feet levitating behind the person riding on an elevator.

""The Eye"" is also somewhat disappointing in that no real chemistry ever develops between the blind woman who receives an eye transplant and the doctor who counsels her after the operation. Although at the end of the film, the two take a dramatic road trip together in order to solve the mystery of the alarming visions that Jessica Alba's character is having - no convincing bond forms between them.

Finally, a volley of what initially sounded to me like pseudo-scientific rationales are delivered to make the premise of this film sound possible. They invoked entanglement and other concepts from quantum physics to make a convincing case that memories can reside in separate body parts. I laughed this off at first. But coincidentally, right after seeing ""The Eye,"" an article appeared in an authoritative scientific magazine explaining that researchers are now coming to believe more literally in ""body knowing."" In their artificial intelligence departments, they are finding that in order to build effective robots, they have to distribute intelligence throughout all the functioning parts of the robot, rather than centralizing commands in a ""brain."" They now believe that this distributed intelligence is actually a better model of how humans themselves function. The article concluded that different parts of the body inform the brain with their memories and intelligences, rather than the other way around.

3325423,2,B0012KJ0CG,"The Eye is the latest American remake of an Asian horror film, this time of the Hong Kong produced film of the same name.  The general theme of nearly all of these Americanized remakes is stick with the original!  I know...some of you don't like to read subtitles but in the case of this film, the original is vastly better.  Jessica Alba continues to get starring roles without demonstrating any particular skill at acting and she's no better here.

She plays a blind concert violinist named Sydney Wells who undergoes cornea transplant surgery to restore her sight.  The operation proves to be successful but soon after, Syndey begins experiencing horrific visions.  At first she thinks these are just nightmares and tries to pass them off but she soon becomes convinced that she's seeing things that the cornea donor saw.  Her Doctor (Nivola) thinks it's merely stress from dealing with the new sensations of her restored sight.

Sydney continues to ""see dead people"" although why her eyes also allow her to HEAR dead people remains a mystery of the film.  The visions are mostly those fleeting glimpses designed to make you jump in your seat although they never amount to any prolonged tension.  Sydney is determined to find out who the donor is and what message they are trying to send with the visions.  While she will learn that donor had a sort of precognitive power to see people's deaths and attempt to prevent them.  This, however, doesn't explain why Sydney would see the ghost of a little boy in her building who is looking for his report card nor the ghost of the little girl in the hospital who died of cancer.  It's just one of the many senseless continuity gaffes in ""The Eye"".  Sydney is also able to see mysterious shadow creatures, which seemingly escort dead spirits off to wherever.  These creatures appear to be evil so are they devils?  They don't like that Sydney can see them but that plot twist goes virtually untapped.

Alba is easy on the eyes (no pun intended) but she lacks any presence or charisma in this role.  The only real strength of her performance was her emotions and struggles as a formerly blind person who is able to see for the first time in decades.  As tedious as Alba was, her co-star Alessandro Nivola is even more boring.  He defiantly tells Sydney that he could ruin his career if he reveals who the donor is...and then he goes and steals the file anyway.

The Eye freely borrows clich&eacute;s from just about every other J-Horror film that's been made in the last decade but none of them are exciting enough to save this film.  Sydney may have had her eyes opened in the film but she'll make ours close tightly.

Obviously the premise is a stretch, but that's the fun of movies.  She is blind and gets a cornea transplant to restore her vision, but the donor of the cornea's could ""see dead people"".

Along with her new eye sight, she gains a 2nd sight.  She can see dead people and, I guess you would call them, grim reapers.  She also has a therapist that does not believe her during most of the movie, but eventually comes through for her and helps her.

This movie almost borders on boredom for me, but it kept my attention with the mystery of why she was seeing the dead.  I wasn't use to seeing Jessica Alba in a film like this, but I thought she did a great job at carrying the film and her acting was convincing, at least for me.

Maybe, the overall film could have been better, but I have nothing to base that off of.  Nothing to offer as to what could be added or done different, but the film tells a story and concludes with answers to questions about the plot of the movie.

3325430,3,B0012KJ0CG,"Perhaps I enjoyed this movie more because I went into it with very, very, very low expectations.  The plot and premise seemed flimsy and ridiculous, and even though I do like Jessica Alba, I wasn't sure decent acting could save a plot that seemed so trite and boring.  But partway through my opinion began to change.  I decided this isn't really a horror movie, not in the classical sense of what has taken over the horror genre (gore like Saw and Hostel).  It's a supernatural mystery with a bit of suspense, if you want to get long-winded and technical.  Nothing about it was implicitly scary, but it was interesting and drew me along.  I wanted to see the end, and not just to find out if I'd won the classic 'guess who survives' horror movie game.

Sure, the premise is implausible and the entire story is completely unbelievable, but it was an entertaining movie and was fun to watch.  I don't ask for realism in my movies (okay, not most of the time!), all I want is to be entertained and this movie, while neither greatly original nor brilliantly written, was enjoyable enough.

3325431,2,B0012KJ0CG,"Some of the American remakes of Asian horror films are worthy of our time and some are not. For instance, the American version of The Ring--with the exception of the incompetently directed, terribly acted initial 10 minutes or so--is actually better than the Japanese version, and a very good ghost story in its own right. The American version of The Grudge is also quite effective as a horror movie. As for The Eye, you're much better off watching the original Pang brothers' Chinese version. For example: One of the key segments of the story is when the main character finds out who donated her transplanted corneas, and sets off to learn what she can about the donor. In the Pang's film, these sequences are pretty startling and creepy, are much more effectively edited, and, compared to the American remake, make better use of sound and camera movement to build suspense. By contrast, this same section of storyline in the American re-make is rushed and cursory. It is ineffective both as storytelling and as cinema--it's just nothing special, when it should have been one of the hallmarks of the film. Other aspects of the American version also come off as sloppy. For instance, Helen, the sister of Sydney (the main character) promises Sydney she will stick by her and help her as she recovers from surgery and learns to cope with her new-found ability to see. But then Helen inexplicably leaves town and we don't see her again until literally the last few seconds of the movie. I don't honestly recall what role the sister played in the Pang's version, but her character serves almost no purpose in the American version. This is just sloppy filmmaking. Bottom line, the Chinese version of The Eye is a pretty good little creepy horror flick (The Eye 2 is also quite good--a very unusual, low key, yet startling, ghost story), but the American version is a complete waste of time. It gets two stars instead of one only because Jessica Alba is so dang pretty.",1216080000,,1964,4.762463343108505

Stories that could be told so much better on film than they actually were because of restrictions such as rating or actors, please stop.

 So why did I even bother viewing The Eye? Because I hoped that there would be some saving grace, even a miniscule bit of saving grace. There was. The story is very interesting, and there are a few bits where it grabbed my attention. It didn't hold it for long. What mainly grabbed me was the story of the donor, and Alba's character to discover the donor's origins. I'm fans of Parker Posey and Alessandro Nivola, and to see them was nice although Parker Posey had maybe a mere 5-6 minutes of screen time. Visually, the film looked crisp and the colors used were great.

 Aside from that, there wasn't much to hold onto. The scares were minimal, and pretty noneffective. None of the characters aside from the donor and Alessandro's effected me. Most of the exposition fell flat. And I don't connect with Jessica Alba.

 In the string of these asian remakes, The Eye sits low on the list of them for me. It may sit at the bottom. As far as movies go, it doesn't sit anywhere on my list.",1215043200,3,1297,4.47457627118644

3325435,2,B0012KJ0CG,"I've talked to a number of people who have really ragged on actress Jessica Alba. They claim that she has no talent whatsoever, that she is nothing more than a pretty face. Well she is that but I think there is more beneath that is not seen often enough. Unfortunately it's also not seen here in THE EYE.

Alba stars as Sydney Wells, a blind concert violinists who is about to have her world completely changed. A donor has been found and replacement eye surgery puts her next in line to receive the gift of vision.

While we are first exposed to her world of sightlessness, as most movies concerning blind characters that suddenly see, the majority of the film deals with what happens after she receives sight. When she wakes in the hospital, she sees things. Since she's never seen before (or at least since she was a child) she's not sure if these images are normal or something else.

With the aid of Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandra Nivola), a doctor whose job it is to help patients like these adjusts to life with sight, Sydney discusses the visions she begins having. Not only is her focus coming in when it comes to those around her, she keeps seeing a dark figures as well. These later adjust to become more than mere shadow figures but horrific images that resemble more nightmares than dreams.

Determined to find out just what is causing these visions, Sydney decides to discover whose eyes she was given. The path of the film to this point is long and tedious. At times you feel like you'll never get here. But we do and that is when we find that Sydney's eyes came from a young Mexican woman who was branded as a witch by the local villagers.

It sis while on a trip to see her family and to get to know more about her that Sydney has her most vivid sight ever, seeing the images of hundreds being carried off by these dark characters she has been seeing. Can she discover just what it is that she is seeing, what it is she is supposed to do?

This movie offers very little in the way of entertainment. The plot seems to move along at a snails pace, feeling a bit redundant at times. The acting is fine and lacks no where, but when the script moves along like this, nothing can save it.

Having seen the original film that this was based on, 2002's Chinese film THE EYE, it was hard not to compare the two films. Fortunately it's been a while since I saw that one and I didn't feel like I was referring back and forth between the two. I will say that the original held my interests more and built suspense and mystery than this production though.

Hollywood seems to have given up on creating new horror, relying more on remakes of horror favorites (even FRIDAY THE 13TH is being remade as I write) and of oriental films like this one or THE GRUDGE and THE RING. Its fine to turn these foreign films into something more English speaking people will see, but if you choose to do so, why not honor the original instead of picking a few scarps of meat from the bones to be content with.

Yes, THE EYE is not a movie I could recommend whole heartedly to rent or purchase. But, as this article began, it does not mean that Jessica Alba is a terrible actress. Even some of the best actresses ever were hindered with bad scripts and bad directing. Let's just hope that Alba recovers from this one and move forward.",1214524800,,3319,4.366288492706645

3325450,2,B0012KJ0CG,"Most of what I think about ""The Eye"" has already been said in the other reviews shown here.

My gripe is mainly with Hollywood. They are completely OUT of fresh ideas for cinema. The well has run dry, and now they're trying to dip into the wells of their neighbors. What I mean by that is the latest trend of ripping off movie ideas from foreign cinema (much like Bollywood rips of Amercian films). ""The Eye"" is the American remake of a similar Asian film that apparently did well in the eastern markets, so it's gotta do well over here. Right?

Wrong.

What other cultures find amusing, scary, offensive, etc. is not necessarily how our culture feels about the same material (ever seen what Russians consider comedy? Not funny at all; but maybe that's just me).

Anywho, to understand what I mean, watch any of John Woo's Hong Kong action films (The Killer, Hard Boiled) and then watch his Hollywood features (Broken Arrow, Face/Off). There is no comparsion. Woo's Hong Kong films are gritty, real, down to earth, and in-your face. His Hollywood films are formulaic and prepackaged for the masses. That's what happens when Hollywood gets its greedy little nubs on something.

My whole point is, this film is predictable, formulaic, and rehashed. It's not something we haven't seen before. Jessica Alba does OK with her role, but nothing award-winning to say the least.

If you are in love with Alba and simply cannot resist looking at her (who could blame you?), then this movie is definitely for you.

If not, skip it and rent something else.",1213574400,11,1544,4.7388059701492535

These Japanese translated into American versions of ""horror films"" is redundant at this point, because none of them are delivering what they so desperately want, which is cover your eyes gasping terror.  I don't know who they are marketing these films to, horror fans?  Well try again,  there are too many good horror films that have all the suspense and blood and guts you can handle to even take 'The Eye"" seriously.  ""The Eye"" was too busy trying to make each scene look pretty, and the story was borderline interesting.  But after seeing trash like ""The Grudge"" 1 and 2, all of the novelties of this amatuer scare tactic type suspense thriller doesn't work.  It's not creepy, it's not disturbing, it's not horrific, it's childish. This is yet another one that I couldn't sit through, I actually had to force myself to even watch half of it.

I admit, I do love the Pang Brothers and have their versions of The Eye, The Eye 2 and even The Eye 10 (an inside joke, but well worth seeing). This version of The Eye is just not very good. It falls into the category of the ones that should not have been remade for they now are so bad, many will not see the original great work of art. This, I believe was my first Jessica Alba movie, and will most likely be the last. Most of the acting in this was sub-par and then some. The only good actor of the bunch was the cancer patient (also played well in the original).

3325455,3,B0012KJ0CG,"Over the past few years Hollywood has been in a remake craze; it seems every horror release is a remake or a sequel. The sad part is there are actually a lot of great remakes over the years, but due to the recent trend that is now often over-looked. The recent hash of remakes has mostly been poor with a few exceptions.

For some reason though the remakes of Asian flicks have been rather terrible; I'm not quite sure why, but these movies do not work in the States. The only remake of an Asian movie I thought was great was The Departed. Besides that they have all been rather bad with some being slightly below average. The remake of The Eye I found better than most of the Asian movie remakes, but with that said The Eye wasn't very good. If anything the movie was simply ok. It wasn't terrible by any means, but it just wasn't all that good.

The screenplay by Sebastian Gutierrez wasn't bad per se, but it's never interesting and that's the problem. The characters are rather boring and the story never fully works. It takes the basic idea of the original, but offers its own twist, which is a good thing. I hate remakes that are the same exact thing as the original. But the direction the movie goes in is just never interesting.

Directors David Moreau & Xavier Palud who have recently gotten some attention due to their French movie Them make their American movie debut. To be honest I didn't really care for Them; it takes the last 20-minutes of a slasher film and stretches it to an hour. Hear a noise and run away. But I did see some potential and had I liked the characters I probably would have liked the movie. While there was potential as filmmakers they sure as hell didn't come near with The Eye.

This is the typical ghost flick we've seen done over and over again. The original Eye wasn't the most original of movies. The basic style has been done plenty of times, but The Pang Brothers put their own twist on it, David Moreau & Xavier Palud never do that. It's really like every other remake of an Asian horror flick. If I didn't know any better I would think it was the same filmmakers each time out. But despite that The Eye is still better than most remakes of Asian horror flicks, which isn't saying much I suppose.

The original was a really eerie movie with some solid suspense. From the very start the Pang Brothers set a tone and maintain that through the whole movie. Moreau & Palud never come anywhere near doing that with their version. There are a few scenes that are just like the original, but never once are they effective. The biggest problem is the use of cheap jump scares.

Like I always say any filmmaker with a little talent can create a jump scare and more often than not we jump not because we're scared, but due to it being a simple reaction. The only time jump scares work is when they are set up prior to that. Moreau & Palud relied on the cheap jump scare tactic and it simply doesn't work. Though I will say the final act is actually quite well-done. While it does seem a bit rushed it's about the only scenes that are effective at all. By no means are they the most suspenseful, but do work well. But it's just as a whole The Eye just never fully works.

Jessica Alba really isn't a very good actress and let's be honest the main reason she's a high profile actress is due to her looks. There is no denying Alba is very nice to look at. I'll give her some credit here though. Alba manages to be more than just eye candy and actually delivers a pretty decent performance. This isn't a great performance, but it was actually pretty good, which surprised me.

In closing, The Eye isn't bad movie, but it's just never really interesting. There was potential, but never reaches it. The Eye makes for a decent time killer, but I'd stick with the original. Again The Eye isn't bad, but just never really interesting.",1212537600,2,3859,4.379888268156424
3325456,2,B0012KJ0CG,"I was a big fan of the unnerving and creepy Asian original, and was curious how well it would translate into an American film. When compared to the first, this version seems unusually light and devoid of suspense. Jessica Alba certainly has the star power and eye candy going for her as Sydney, the lead character who was tragically blinded at age five, but her range is limited and her ability to express anything beyond a mild surprise is annoyingly ineffective. When Sydney undergoes a cornea transplant and first sees light and shapes for the first time in decades, her response is tepid, at best, and nonchalant, leading one to believe the scene is little more than an afterthought so the movie can begin.

Once Sydney begins to regain her sight, she discovers she is able to see dead people and characters that snatch up the recently deceased and take them to whatever realm they belong (they do have a bit of shock value at first, but it fades, and there is no other explanation). This comes from the donor of the cornea, who herself was able to see the dead. Sydney remarkably and without any surprise or revelation regains her vision without any since of wonder whatsoever, leaving us absent any real sense of any newfound discovery. Her visions eventually lead her to Mexico, along with her therapist, where she confronts the source of her hauntings (I'll be intentionally vague, but it's not as interesting as it sounds). A gooey ending is followed by a bubble gum pop song while the credits roll, a testament to the movie's apparent desire to please thirteen year old girls and avoid any real chills or tension.

I remember explicitly a scene in the original film where the lead character is trapped in a moving elevator while a spirit slowly, and with a great sense of dread, hovers just out of her line of sight. The scene is shot with great skill, using camera angles, actress expressions, and lighting to effectively express a sense of terror. This film lacks any of that, and fails to truly create much tension between Sydney and her ghostly apparitions. While there is little CGI effects (no harm there) the use of light and shadows to create suspense is oddly absent after the first third of the film.

Disappointment sums up my thoughts on ""The Eye"" and I'll stick with a recommendation for the original. This acts more like a TV movie than it does a theater experience, which does make it appropriate for a rental.",1212537600,,2435,4.684579439252336
3325457,5,B0012KJ0CG,"Personally I don't see why so many people bash this movie! Jessica Alba was at her best if you ask me.

....

Synopsis: Sydney (played by our lovely Jessica Alba is a young, blind, violinist. She has been blind since childhood, after an accident with a firecrack. She is given the chance to see for the first time since childhood through a miraculous corneal transplant. As Sydney adjusts to the dizzy world of color and shapes she hasn't seen in years she's hunated by horrifying images and visons of death, it'self, dragging the 'doomed' away from the living world. On the brink of insanity, Sydney must discover whose eyes she has inherited, and what secret visions they have held.

....

Perhaps the people who bash this movie don't realize, what Jessica put into this peice. That she learned to play the violin while filming it. That she actually learned to read braille.

This isn't the first movie Jessica has 'gotten into the role' with. Poor girl, in Good Luck Chuck, though it was an accident, in the scene with the penguins where she slips and falls into the water, and 'chips a tooth' She really does. Talking 'method acting' Must say I feel for her, that had to hurt.

....

All in all my opinion, this movie is a ""must"" have for any Jessica Alba fan. 'The Eye' with it's turns and twist, keep you guessing to the end.

We enjoy watching Asian movies because they generally have a way of depicting a whole different level of creepy in their films. However, I think this one did a better job of making the viewer really feel an emotional attachment for her and what she had to endure and some pretty good moments of feeling high tension. This movie to me was worth watching.",1209772800,4,435,4.589743589743589
3325459,5,B0012KJ0CG,"The moment this movie was announced, the Cruise/Wagner produced remake of the Hong Kong film, The Eye, was destined to be hated or loathed. However, unlike the film that comes afterward, Jumper, which was terrible in every aspect of the word, there's no merit to the low ratings this film's gotten (you know, other than personal opinion and disdain for Jessica Alba). I had the pleasure of watching the original ""EYE"" film before seeing the remake and I enjoyed it immensely.

I'm glad to say that, like the American remakes before this one, ---The Ring (Ringu) and The Grudge (Ju-on: The Grudge)--, The Eye is without a doubt the best adaptation of its original movie since the aforementioned films. Naturally, some changes are made to accommodate cultural differences and the current timeline of the world.

The story follows Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba), classical violinist, who has lived with an accident-caused blindness since she was just five years old. Now, nearly 20 nears later, she finally getting a transplant surgery that will restore her sight. At first, she is confused and disoriented, unable to understand if what she sees is ""real"" or not.

During her first night with her new eyes, her bedmate at the hospital dies, and Sydney, not understanding, watches her blurry figure being led away by someone else. During her stay, she also befriends a young girl named Alicia Milstone (Chloe Moretz), who is there undergoing surgery for a brain tumor.

As time goes on, Sydney's vision begins to clear up and she struggles to understand the new world around her. Her therapist, Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola), feels that her strange visions are her mind's way of interpreting what it was never able to before. However, when she starts to see more and more apparitions of the dearly departed, Sydney believes otherwise. Her sister, Helen Wells (Parker Posey) worries that the stress of her new experiences are beginning to get to Sydney, but Sydney persists that everything she is seeing real.

With no one to believe she is actually seeing the ghosts, the terrible visions of fire and death, Sydney struggles to retain her sanity as she attempts to decipher the mystery behind original owner of her eyes.

In terms of faithfulness, THE EYE is a near-recreation of its predecessor. Scenes mirror each other with only minor differences. The storyline is true to its source material, again, with only minor changes. For instance, instead of the donor being from Northern Thailand, she is from Mexico, but their fates are largely the same. Another nice touch is, like Keri Russell for August Rush, Jessica Alba took violin lessons for film (assuming I remember correctly). So whether or not she's actually playing on screen and not simply mimicking the movements while a soundtrack plays in the background, it's a nice bit of information to know. Granted, a lot of people will bi**h and moan about the way the movie ends, as its quite different from the original, but given the motivation Sydney uses to get the civilians to flee from danger, I can believe it (even though most in reality would laugh you off the bus and call you a lair).

The atmosphere of the movie a hardly scary, but it manages to weave a sense of unease, uncertainty (in concerns of Sydney's sanity), and tense moments when you least expect things to jump out at you. On technical aspects, the CGI used in the film blends well against the surrounding reality, especially near the end of the film. The ghosts, [Grim Reapers?], that usher spirits into the next world are more unsettling in appearance opposed to the originals. Which honestly begs the question as to whom they're actually working for -- especially since they ""don't like to be seen"".

The performances in this film are excellent. Jessica Alba especially shows off a surprisingly convincing dramatic side of her highly doubted skills as an actress. She excels in every scene she's in and more than proves her worth (to me anyhow). Parker Posey's performance Alba's moody sister, Helen, is entertaining for the short time she appears in the film; its made perfectly clear that her character blames herself still what happened to her sister.

Alessandro Nivola's Dr. Paul Faulkner, is about as likeable as Lawrence Chou's Dr. Wah in the beginning of the original film. Only, I didn't end up liking him at the end of this remake like I did the aforementioned character. Faulkner didn't strike me as that engaging of a character, though it could be because of Alessandro's deadpan performance.

Marco Beltrami`s, the to-go guy if you want a quick score for a horror movie, score is suitable for the movie, though its rarely noticeable at times (I was a little too engrossed in the movie to listen). Overall, THE EYE, I think, has managed to stay faithful the original source material while creating something new along the way. A highly recommended movie. --- [a 5 out of 5] -- [April 23, 2008].",1208908800,7,4935,4.892344497607655
3325460,4,B0012KJ0CG,"Jessica Alba plays Sydney Wells, who went blind at the age of seven as a result of a firecracker accident with her sister. I'll only mention this as an interjection, because that's how it felt in the movie, but Parker Posie is a horrible actress, was completely forgettable, and may actually have some sort of sense deprivation similar to the star character in this movie. Despite Posie's black-hole of suck ""acting"" style, Jessica Alba manages to carry every scene with her incredible beauty and acting ability.

Despite the disability, Wells has moved on well enough in life to be a celebrated violinist, living successfully in the big city at a swanky condo expensive enough to have an elevator employee. Somehow she doesn't have a boyfriend or love interest; so she can devote most of her time to her career, being nice, and listening to her sister harp (pun intended) on her about getting cornea transplants.

After getting the surgery, she is sent to a specialist, of what I have no idea. However, Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola) is an eye specialist that helps cornea transplant recipients readjust to their new sight, but he does so in the most callous manner possible, without even the slightest regard for the psychological trauma someone may experience when gaining one of the five senses they've lived without their entire adult life. His approach is essentially the equivalent of telling someone with a torn hamstring to rub some dirt on it and get back in the game. The fact that he has the perpetual George Michael five-o'clock shadow, and nearly no compassion adds little credibility to his portrayal as a doctor.

Along with Sydney's new-found vision, she also begins to see abnormalities (eerie ghosts, spooky images, blurry suspicions, etc.). She seems to have the ability to see events in the past, events in the future, as well as people making their after-life transition. Not only that, but she also begins having visions of her surroundings changing, and gray, creepy apparitions of some kind acting as escorts to the aforementioned recently deceased. One can only assume they are escorts towards a purgatory of some sort; otherwise, there is no reason to make the apparitions evil, especially when escorting off innocent, out-going, little girls with terminal brain cancer.

The plot moves along when Sydney find out the reflection she sees is of a different woman, and from there she must find out who this woman is, and why she wants from Sydney. (This scene reminded me of Scott Bakula's character in the old TV show Quantum Leap, except the reflections were very rarely as attractive) She makes the connection around this time and realizes all the visions have to do with her eye donor.

The conclusion comes about when Sydney inevitably avenges the death of her donor by completing an altruistic deed left unfinished. Lives are saved, the evil escort spirits are thwarted, and the donor's soul can rest in one of the most predictable endings in movie history.

In the perpetual stream of Japanese horror flicks made into mediocre Hollywood productions, this is nothing more than a typical translation. And, just like the commanalities in language translation, this movie comes across about as scary as many of the Engrish signs I've seen; it may work in Japan, but in America it comes across as somewhat silly and contrived...but it's still the best translation yet, because Jessica Alba takes it to the next level.",1206835200,2,3451,4.972270363951473
3325461,3,B0012KJ0CG,"This is a spoiler-free review of ""The Eye.""

If you're looking for a few decent thrills and a competently made horror film in the ""Sixth Sense"" subgenre, you might want to check out ""The Eye."" I saw this recently with almost no expectations after reading some incredibly harsh reviews. I was surprised at how enjoyable it was, and how it avoided what could have been some exceptionally heavy-handed social commentary. No, this isn't an especially original horror film, and it isn't particularly gory or edgy. But it's certainly gripping enough for me to recommend it, and I hope it gains a larger audience on DVD.

Jessica Alba plays a blind violinist who receives a corneal transplant and almost immediately starts seeing supernatural visions. While some of them reminded me of the typical Asian oddball ghosts we've seen recently, others reminded me more of creatures from ""Pan's Labyrinth."" Regardless, most of them were creepy. Jessica Alba gives her best performance since ""Dark Angel"" in this movie (I've been very critical of practically every film she's done) and it's to her credit that the movie works as well as it does. She channels the same spirit of alienation that she did as Max on ""Dark Angel"" and it's hard not to have sympathy for a character who is as isolated as she is by the middle third of the film. As the only A-list talent in the film, everything is on Jessica's shoulders and she rises to the occassion.

Most of the supporting characters aren't fleshed out very well, suggesting that either whole reels were left in the editing room or the filmmakers were trying to capture the sketchy nature of ""Carnival of Souls"" (which portions of ""The Eye"" strongly resemble). This helps prevent ""The Eye"" from ever becoming a great film but as I've stated before, it's a solid nonpretentious horror flick.",1205020800,,1823,4.855305466237942
3325462,3,B0012KJ0CG,"This movie isn't half as awful as I expected. At least, there's an odd mix of really bad parts and really good parts.

Of course, some things in this movie are pretty ridiculous. For example, the character of her therapist (the main character after Alba's) seems completely unprofessional and unconvincing, and the relationship between them is confusingly unrealistic. And it was really annoying how the ghosts she saw would sort of calmly drift away into the afterlife or wander off or something, and then for no apparent reason other than to shock the audience they'd suddenly jump out in front of her and go ""boo."" Why? Thank goodness they stopped doing that after the first twenty minutes or so.

But some of this movie was actually kind of neat. The parts where she sees scary things but can hardly make them out through her post-surgery blurry-vision, rendered in first person for the audience to see, are very creepy. Alba's character seems to have no friends to turn to for help except her therapist, which gives the movie an odd atmosphere of desperation and loneliness. And the overall plot is basically exciting. The conclusion, thank goodness, is NOT one of those irritating nonsensical shock-value-only twists that most other films inspired by Chinese/Japanese horror movies have.

Okay, I knew what I was getting into with this one. No one can do the Pang Brothers like the Pang Brothers can do the Pang Brothers. I think I went to see it just to find out how badly Hollywood (who had the Pang Brothers for one film, the highly underrated The Messengers, then cast them back into the waters of Hong Kong) would mangle the brilliant original. While it wasn't a total loss, it was the kind of carnage you have to slow down to take a look at.

The story is the same: a young violinist, Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba), who was struck blind at the age of five, receives a cornea transplant. All is well and good, except that she starts having visions that she soon realizes are the memories of the donor, a Mexican woman (Fernanda Romero) who committed suicide. (Unlike in the original, this isn't a spoiler; we see her suicide in the opening shot.) Wells becomes convinced she has to go to Mexico and fins out all she can about the donor, against the advice of her doctor, Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola), who, while finding her frustrating, is attracted to her. (Well, it's Jessica Alba, wouldn't you be?)

As usual, the butchering could have been avoided had anyone decided on a shot-by-shot remake instead of watering down everything that made the original great. (Those who have seen the original will probably be groaning at the film's climax, which is grossly redone.) There are a few scenes here that do stand out, as when Wells ducks into the Chinese restaurant, but a few memorable scenes are a far cry from a good movie.

While this won't be an Oscar contender, it is much better than advertised and worth the price of admission.

The Story

Movies about paranormal or psychic activities usually require you to suspend disbelief.  The story requires more stretch than usual because Jessica Alba's character plays a wealthy, good looking professional violinist who is somehow still a single loner.  When her eye surgery (cornea transplant) has her seeing ghosts, the stretches in the plotline seem tame by comparison.

The movie mainly consists of her trying to find out who her donor was and why she's seeing strange things.  There's plenty of shock images of specters that scream across the screen to startle you.  Still, this isn't exactly a ""horror"" movie and there's no real gore to speak of.  The movie uses the vague uncertainty of her situation to make you feel more dread than fear.

The story line has a ""surprise ending"" that is done well enough.  It's clear that the story was changed many times, perhaps at the expense of the movie.  But in the end, it wraps up nicely enough as long as you don't over-analyze it.

Acting and Direction

As far as acting is concerned, Alba does a much better job than the critics will ever give her credit for.  In fact, her performance makes this movie watchable.  Considering some of the dialogue she has to work with, she does an admirable job.

Her supporting cast is used less effectively.  The director decided to use Alessandro Nivola (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-Laid-Plans/dp/630571486X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best Laid Plans</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laurel-Canyon/dp/B00009MEKN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laurel Canyon</a>), as the doctor, in a deadpan way that neither showcases his acting skills nor aids in plot development.  And Parker Posey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broken-English/dp/B000OU082G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broken English</a>)is thrown in as the sister, showing up only enough to get a paycheck.

Effects and Cinematography

Special effects are good though not groundbreaking.  There is some nice CG aided photography in the movie to show slow motion stills.  It's used well, and it's clear that some technically strong people worked on the shooting and editing of this movie.  Still, audiences have come to expect so much in terms of special effects that this movie will not leave people impressed.

Conclusion

Could the story have been much better?  Yes.  Could the acting and direction been improved?  Absolutely.  Still, this is a fun movie that's worth seeing in the theatre and will appeal to a wide audience of Alba fans from her sci-fi beginnings&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Angel-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JLJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Angel - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;to her more recent role in Sin City&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B00005JNTX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>.  In fact, those into the paranormal will find enough to keep them interested.

The timing of this movie was the main error.  It was released in the dead of winter when it's very difficult to get traction for movies like this.  I hope that the DVD will include enough special features to be worth a buy.

3325465,1,B0012KJ0CG,"The Eye, starring(and I use that term loosely) one Jessica Alba is another chapter in a seemingly endless series of Japanese based suspense/horror piece ripoffs, purpetrated on viewers by a Hollywood that simlply seems to have run out of ideas as well as conscience.

The premise is not altogether horrible for a film of this genre.  But in the hands of the Hollywood machine, my hopes for even a passable suspense tale were dashed quickly.

Alba, who is cast grossly out of her acting range, plays a woman in her twenties who was blinded as a child.  Predicatably she lives alone despite being gourgeous and financially well off.  She is also pathetically naive despite living in a big city.  But worst of all is that she is a first class concert musician.  Because all blind characters in Hollywood are musical geniuses right?  (Why did she have to be first chair violin?  Wouldn't it have made her a more real and interesting character if she was say, third chair and struggling just to stay in the orchestra?)  But I digress.

After a corneal transplant, her vision is restored.  Soon after the surgery, she begins seeing images that aren't there.  Unfortunately for the audience, these visions are mostly indistinghishable so we aren't ever really sure what we're supposed to be afraid of.  And it occurred to me very early in the film that there is a fundamental flaw in the way this tale is told.  The movie makes no bones about the fact that, while these visions portend to some event in the past or future, what Alba sees at that moment is nothing more than a ""vision"" and not actually a real event.  Since we know these sequences aren't real when we see them, there is no jeopardy or danger and thus, no reason for us to be frightened.  This destroys any chance to generate tension!  How could a filmmaker not know this?

The Eye plods along with one ho-hum ""vision"" sequence after another, never really advancing the plot much.  You are left bored waiting for something...anything to happen of interest in the film.  Then out of nowhere the final act mercifully begins to bring the story to resolution.  There is a particularly ridiculous scene late in the film that sums up how bad a job the director did in this film.  The scene is intended to be emotional and dramatic but it actually drew laughter in the theater when it played.  (Incidentally, there were several instances of unintended laughter during this film which should be a sign of just how bad this one is.)  Anyway, Alba is on the floor of a basement in some slum in Mexico.  She is holding the girl who was her cornea donor.  (Even though she's already dead and buried and Alba is the only one who can see her.)  Inexplicably, the already dead girl dies...again in her arms.  Huh?  The film then cuts to a shot of Alba on the floor miming as if she's holding someone, meaning her arms are empty.  The scene is so bad it is truly comical.  The entire theater erupted in laughter when this shot came on.  At that moment I realized the value of test screenings.  Anyway, don't say you weren't warned.  If you see The Eye, it will make you wish you clawed yours out.",1201910400,7,3138,4.562724014336918
3325466,3,B0012KJ0CG,"I hate it when a supernatural thriller makes me question things about the plot, namely its plausibility. ""The Eye"" is a film like that, and that's too bad because I really wanted to immerse myself in the thrills and chills without focusing on the specifics. Yes, this movie is creepy and tense, but it's also completely unbelievable, from the characterizations to the plot details to the ending, which is so ridiculous and contrived that I almost felt cheated. Pretty much the only believable part of the story is the supernatural element, which involves the transplanted eyes of a formerly blind woman seeing horrible things. It probably doesn't matter that I've never seen the Chinese film this is based on, or even that I have no idea how a medical procedure like a corneal transplant really works; what does matter is that ""The Eye"" succeeds in being frightening but fails at telling a good story.

Jessica Alba plays Sydney Wells, a concert violinist who went blind at age five because of an incident with firecrackers. Her sister, Helen (Parker Posey), feeling responsible for Sydney's condition, has her undergo a corneal transplant. Soon enough, Sydney is lying in a hospital recovery room with bandages over her eyes; when removed, she sees a world of blurred images and undefined shapes, which is normal so soon after such a procedure. But then she begins to see things that aren't normal, ugly, gray-skinned things that disappear and reappear at will. As her vision gets clearer, she soon discovers that they serve as postmortem escorts, leading ghosts away from their bodies and into another realm. Where they go and why they do this is never explained, but I guess it doesn't matter since they were effective.

Not so effective are the circumstances surrounding a series of visions. As she struggles to cope with newfound eyesight, Sydney's life is plagued by recurring nightmares and ghostly visitations, all of which incrementally reveal unfamiliar people and places. They all seem to have something to do with a devastating fire and the deaths of many people, but it's unclear as to what they mean or why she's seeing it. She eventually realizes that it has something to do with the eye donor, but any attempts at extracting information are flatly rejected. It's confidential, they say. They only one willing to help is her therapist, Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola), a man I neither believed in nor cared about. A character this out of place shouldn't be so quick to point out all of the ways Sydney will have trouble adjusting; he says that because she's been dependant on her other senses for so long, she won't know how to handle what she sees. This may be true, but he certainly wasn't able to convince me.

The search for the donor leads Sydney and Paul into Mexico, and this is pretty much where the film is at its worst. It isn't until then we learn that Paul is fluent in Spanish, which isn't unrealistic so much as it's convenient for the plot, as is the fact that the first real character they meet is fluent in English. I can't really describe this part without being annoyingly vague, so let us leave it at the fact that Sydney has been called there for something directly related to the visions she's been having.

This is the kind of plot that sounds decent enough on paper but doesn't quite measure up on the big screen. Much like the sequence in Mexico, most of ""The Eye"" is dependent on convenience, whether or not it's plausible. Sydney's casual attitude towards her new eyesight is downright maddening, as is the ease with which she navigates streets, hallways, stairs, and elevators. For someone used to doing all this blindly, she behaves as if she has been able to see her whole life. The character development is painfully lacking, especially when it comes to side characters that seem important but ultimately contribute nothing. Take, for example, Alicia Millstone (Chloe Moretz), a nine-and-a-half year old cancer patient living in the hospital: she seems desperate to be friends with Sydney, so much so that she enters Sydney's room whenever she feels like it and offers herself as a kind-hearted soul. But why does she feel so connected? Why does she care at all, considering her own struggles? This character was the weakest of the film, more so than the unbelievable Paul Faulkner.

One aspect of the film I did like related to Sydney's mirror image. When she fails to recognize herself in a picture taken by Helen, she realizes that her reflection is in fact not her own, but that of the donor. How psychological. How symbolic. How jaw-droppingly unnerving. Of course, it's nothing more than one shocking moment--the rest of the film is nowhere near as effective in terms of drawing the audience in. Had the story been halfway as good as it sounded, the film could have been something more. It would be too much to say that ""The Eye"" is a bad film, but it would be untrue to say that it worked, and I say this because it wanted to be more than just a run of the mill supernatural thriller. But when a film about sight is bookended by voiceover narrations that say you shouldn't trust your eyes, a supernatural thriller is the best it's ever going to be.",1201824000,10,5207,4.761904761904762

8246464,4,B0012KJ0CG,"I am erring on the high side of 3.5 stars.

The poster made this look like yet another cookie-cutter horror film, and it absolutely does not do it justice. It is a deeply flawed film, but it does some things beautifully, painfully right. Jessica Alba brings a pathos and befuddlement to the role that is perfect for the character, and I enjoyed her performance very much.

Thematically, there are some problematic messages -- but there is also a great deal of value in what this film has to say. Visually it is striking at times, and totally jarring at times.  Honestly, it feels like the people who made this film really wanted to tell a story about the physical and philosophical ramifications of regaining sight, but packaged it in a horror wrapping so that it would be more consumable for those of us who tend to give thought pieces a pass in favour of entertainment we can have on in the background whilst we do something else. There are some remarkable insights and thoughts here that, on the whole, more than compensate for the more thoughtless parts of the script.

All in all, I am very glad I gave this one a go.",1495756800,,1122,4.512315270935961
