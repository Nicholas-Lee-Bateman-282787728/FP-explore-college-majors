8110776,5,B000EJW2EY,"I found the DVD ""Maori culture traditions and history"" to be an excellent documentary about the Maori Culture of New Zealand.  Historian, Mr Don Stafford, presents the program in an easy yet informative style. The art and traditions on the culture are well covered...there is eve a bonus video clip of a full Maori Haka (War dance)!!. Regarding value...there is a beautiful bonus documentary entitled ""Wonders of Nature"" also included in the DVD...this shows all the beautiful natural sights and scenery New Zealand is renowned for!!...Highly recommended!!",1140912000,24,556,5.390804597701149
