I especially appreciated the fact that at the end of the movie there was a dialog about breast cancer awareness. It was a great way to remind both women and men to be mindful of their bodies.  For that I thank you.",1519516800,,308,4.293103448275862
8342138,5,B001TNSLVW,"Each of the four step-sisters has a unique personality - ranging from the witch with a capital ""B"" Isabella to the funny sex author Patricia. This movie followed the lives of each of the sisters and was totally enjoyable.  Thanks to the subtitles, my Filipino vocabulary is growing!",1501200000,,282,4.875
