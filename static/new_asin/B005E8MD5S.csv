All of the creepy supernatural vibe from the original is long gone and the characters are neither compelling or menacing.  Worth a rental, but save yourself the import costs!",1429574400,,270,4.723404255319149

my review for the movie itself follows - but first - i want to warn potential buyers about the particular DVD that i purchased via Amazon from Rising Sun Productions (address on label: Kung Fu DVD World, Stroudsburg PA). While the shipment arrived in good time (5 days) - the quality of the DVD is poor.

The distributor (from the DVD back cover bottom left) is Bonzai Media Corporation. Search the web for that company and you may be warned off. While the front cover image on the Amazon page is decent, the cheap design of the back image (see my photo) - which wasn't shown on the Amazon page - would have made me suspicious of the DVD's origins.

The shrink-wrap of the DVD was suspiciously loose fitting and the Title strip at the top that seals the container shut had warps (see photo).

I had seen the movie before, so I was immediately struck by how degraded the DVD movie image was. There was loss of color and contrast, There was even some (insignificant) cropping due to reducing the aspect ratio to 16:9.

Another annoying issue was the embedded Chinese subtitles. You can disable the english subtitles which are positioned below the screen image - but not the Chinese - which is positioned at the bottom of the screen image.

Not that viewers will care, but the end credits are cut short, too.

I am currently attempting to return the DVD. For the price, I should be getting a top quality movie transfer. This DVD is crap.

-- followup on refund

i had to get Amazon involved since the vendor wouldn't respond - a refund was given to me

------------------------------- MOVIE REVIEW

as a fan of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chinese-Ghost-Story-film-trilogy/dp/B004M3HZWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chinese Ghost Story film trilogy</a>&nbsp;starring the luscious Joey Wong - i was worried about watching this one - would it be as good - as fun

it started out a little confusedly - thanks to a lot of quick cutting and flashbacks - with a brief story of a demon hunter falling for a very pretty demon - who luckily prefers candy to human blood - very soon - he does something unseen to erase her memory of him - which is strange - cuz it seems that his memory of her is the main problem

about 6-1/2 minutes into the film - the title card appears - and the lilting original theme song is heard - as a young man with the familiar wooden rack on his back appears - wearing familiar garb - this time he's now a craftsman of some sort working for the government - so he's sent by a water deprived village up the nearby mountain to find a source of water - where he encounters the lovely demon from the earlier scenes - and comes into conflict with the tree demon - played by an actress this time

the demon hunter soon returns - he replaces the monk of the original movies - this time - joining the young couple in a romantic triangle of sorts - altho he's hoping to overcome his feelings for the demon - and perhaps kill her - in order to enable himself to become a wholehearted demon killer

the tone of the film is different - the goofy fun found in the original was just too delicate to recreate - so i'm glad these people didn't try - the result is more somber - yet still a little light - and slightly deeper emotionally - tho i felt the emotional impact came up short in the end

Liu Yi Fei (Crystal Liu) manages to recreate the same melancholy vibe as Joey Wong in the original - she's an equally glorious beauty too - this storyline gives her a chance to prove that she's a capable young actress - so much so i'm gonna find&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-FORBIDDEN-KINGDOM/dp/B001BEK8GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM</a>&nbsp;to see her in an english speaking role

the other actors are at least as good - the visuals are rich & colorful - the special effects very sophisticated

this is a very good film in itself - with elements borrowed from the original series of films - and skillfully woven into something fresh - it's well worth a watch from those who saw the older series - and those who didn't",1363046400,2,4189,4.738651994497936
