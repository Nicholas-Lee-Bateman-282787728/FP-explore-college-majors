2430704,5,B000BO0LE0,I loved this movie.  It was just a down right good movie from beginning to end.  Kind of lets you go back to the way things were back in that day.,1141171200,3,146,3.6774193548387095
2430705,5,B000BO0LE0,"I know you can find poker now on ESPN, Fox, Food TV and cartoon network, but I don't watch any of them. You wanna know why? Come here, I'll tell you. First, I'm an incredibly gifted poker player and second, this movie is all you need to know about poker. To this day, when a loser comes up to me and asks how to play poker you know what I tell them? I say, ""You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away and know when to reach across the table and drop a people's elbow"" I learned that from the Mr. Myagi of poker, Kenneth Dale Rogers. This movie is about a crazy poker player that makes people mad with his cooky ways and then sings his way out of trouble.

I do this too. I win every poker game I play because I can bluff like you can only dream of. They call me Rich Kings Bluffnest Nook when I play poker. That's my name combined with bluffing. I can be holding a 2, a king, a 7, a joker and a 1985 topps Bob Owchinko baseball card and I can get a guy with a straight flush to fold. I'm just gifted I guess. I'm like Steve Perry of Journey, sometimes you wonder if I'm of this world. Well, get this DVD and you are only your journey to being 1/34th as good as me.",1134691200,3,1201,3.8623481781376516

2430713,4,B000BO0LE0,"This is a very nice set!  The movies are crisp and clear and we watched it right away.  The only reason I gave it a four star instead of a five star was the second movie case top on the side was sawed through with black flaky stuff.  Don't know how that happened, but it didn't affect the DVD.  Of course, the CD was wonderful to listen to.  Love Kenny Rogers movies and songs!",1371600000,,377,4.04054054054054
2430714,5,B000BO0LE0,IT IS A GREAT MOVIE MY KIDS LOVE IT  AND I ALWAYS WANTED  I NEED TO GET THE OTHER ONES,1367452800,,86,3.25
2430715,5,B000BO0LE0,"If you like Kenny Rogers, you'll like this movie.
Good story line, good acting.
Would recommend to anyone looking for a decent movie",1364083200,,132,4.782608695652174
2430716,4,B000BO0LE0,Enjoyed the movie when it was on TV so thought I would buy it so I could watch it again.,1362268800,,88,3.45
2430717,5,B000BO0LE0,Got this for a Christmas gift for my husband. I had never seen these shows. I loved it!! The tin is soo nice and I love the music. It is such a great idea on having the cd play when you push the button!! Love Kenny Rogers!,1358985600,,222,3.74468085106383
2430718,5,B000BO0LE0,this was a super gift set the 2 movies were good and the bonus of a cd & a musical feature on the tin box which made the whole package excellent.,1344816000,,145,3.7096774193548385
2430719,3,B000BO0LE0,the product was fine except for poor picture. It had alot of scratch markes in the picture indicating that it was  and old move and not top of the line recording.,1344384000,,162,4.225806451612903
2430720,5,B000BO0LE0,"I have looked for this copy for quite somtime.  I am very pleased to find this particular copy and will now look for the other ""Gambler"" videos.",1338681600,,144,4.333333333333333
2430721,5,B000BO0LE0,"This is a superb collection,and you'll be impressed with this product before even unwrapping it. How's that?,you might ask. Well,look at the top edge of the tin box and you'll find a red button with instructions,""Press to play"".Presto! Kenny Rogers will sing ""The Gambler"" for you.
 This beautifully packaged collection comes in a tin box,with front and back covers. It is the 30th Anniversity Collector's Edition. The collection includes the original movie ""The Gambler"" plus 2 full length movies totalling another 180 minutes,""The Adventure Continues"".It's hard to believe that these 3 movies came out 30 years ago and they are still as good or better than what we have seen in recent years. It may come as a surprise to you,that even thouhg ""The GAMBLER"" is probably the song most people associate with Kenny Rogers;he didn't actually write it. It was written by songwriter Don Schlitz in 1978. It is however,the song that really skyrocked Kenny Rogers' career. Although the song is heard in the movies,Kenny Rogers doesn't actually sing it in the movies.
 The storyline is very good and continues through the 3 movies,however; some of the actors and characters change.
 All three movies have well depicted and exciting scenes.
As much as Kenny Rogers plays the main role in all three movies;I particularly enjoyed Linda Evans and her role as Kate Muldoon. She played one of the most interesting characters and did an excellent job.
 One of my favorite Western TV Series was ""The Rifleman"" starring Chuck Connors. It ran for 168 episodes between 1958 and 1963. They were half-hour shows and one of the best during that period when popular westerns like Gunsmoke,Bonanza,Big Valley;etc.were really great entertainment,making the stuff like reality shows,we are getting today pale by comparison. Linda Evans played the role of Barbara Stanwicks daughter in Big Valley. But her portrayal of Kate Muldoon in ""The Gambler"" is something else!!
Nobody in a Western ever came close to Chuck Connors as ""the Rifleman"" when he ""let go"" with those 11 shots in rapid fire from his specially adapted Winchester. He had to recock for each shot;but he made it look like an automatic repeating rifle. Well,wait till you see Kate Muldoon (Linda Evans) show her skills. Without a doubt the best action scene in all three movies.
 When you finish the three movies,sit back and enjoy the rest of the collection. The CD included has 14 songs. These are some of Kenny's most popular songs .He sings 10 by himself and does 4 of them with Dottie West.
 You can't go wrong with this collection whether you are a longtime fan of Kenny Rogers; or a gift for someone who is a fan of Westerns and/or Kenny Rogers.",1333411200,,2687,4.920529801324503
2430722,5,B000BO0LE0,"I bought this product and I would recommend it to anyone who loves Kenny Rogers not only his music but the movies he is in. He is a great actor and a singer
as well. This movie box tin is wonderful and love to content it gave me to listen too and watch.",1329868800,,253,3.792452830188679
2430723,5,B000BO0LE0,"It was great to see this movie again; don't know why TV stations have not shown it in many years. Kenny Rogers has been a really good singer since his days w/ The First Edition through his switch to country style music & The Gambler theme song is 1 of his best [Ruby is another good song]. Not only is he a good singer, Rogers is a pretty good actor in his role as Brady Hawks too. The supporting actors in The Gambler are also good, & the story keeps your interest throughout. If you like westerns, & don't have The Gambler in your collection, it's a good un'.",1313971200,4,561,4.155963302752293
2430724,5,B000BO0LE0,"I'll be honest. I haven't seen any of the gambler movies. I bought this for my step dad. He told me he enjoyed it a lot. Besides, I like westerns too. And any western with kenny rogers has to be good.",1271203200,,200,3.902439024390244
2430725,3,B000BO0LE0,"The confusion for me is what he won in the final confrontation?
The railroad gambling action is fun
and the saloon fights are pretty good too.
I think the theme song is maybe the best part of the movie.
Otherwise it is just another western that appears to be not all that well written? California and Arizona on the Southern Pacific Rail Road
after the 1860's wasn't owned by one man?
Anyway I liked the movie, but can't give it very high marks for plot.",1244332800,,454,4.352941176470588

Sidebar; It's just a shame that his vanity got the best of him and all the plastic surgeries took away so much of who he really is.
A lot of these values need to be brought back in America and the world.",1521331200,,264,4.196078431372549
