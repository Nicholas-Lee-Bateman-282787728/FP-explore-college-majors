8046344,5,B00079UU04,"There might be other Italian cooks you know better, but I love Mary Ann Esposito--she's like listening to my Italian grandmother. You get to watch over Mary Ann's shoulder as she cooks in true Italian style. This DVD contains four shows that all take place as Mary Ann travels around Umbria--you see her make dishes with local ingredients and you get some wonderful travel tips and beautiful Italian scenery!

As a longtime fan of Mary Ann's, I'm glad to see that her shows are finally out on DVD. The DVD has some cool extra features--one of the best is that you can print out the recipes featured on the episodes when you pop the DVD into your computer. I really liked the combination of cooking and travel--it's like taking a guided tour of Italy.

As an Italian myself, I have to say that Mary Ann is very authentic and her style is easy to follow. If you want to learn how to cook like real Italians do, pick up Mary Ann's DVD.",1104537600,10,932,4.412790697674419
