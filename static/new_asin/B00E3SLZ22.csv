5888212,2,B00E3SLZ22,"This miniseries just makes me furious.  The one gun nut I know is appalling and told me that he didn't get into the military but told my mother that he got in but his traditional parents couldn't risk the safety of their only son.  He is APPALLING and he intimidates my mother by telling her that she can't go into his rented premises because he has ten guns and booby traps.

A cop saw his apartment and hated him as a result.  But this guy carries a badges as well and made a big show of showing up in uniform and with his work car to intimidate my mother.

I am not intimidated at all by this joker and yes, all spree shooters are huge dorks - who cares.  They obviously did not learn manners and respect but the problem is that it is too easy to get into law enforcement and carry a badge to intimidate your targets.  Not only do members of organized crime insinuate themselves into drug investigations as members of law enforcement but they also let their bosses' murder victims families know whose side the law is on.

We don't care what a huge dork the gun nut killers are.  But too many dorks get a badge and shoot to kill so it's not that law enforcement only should be allowed to carry guns and the public should just rely on the law like the Mounties in Moncton to deal with giant dorks but that the trigger happy with or without badges should be sussed out and lose the protection of the badge.  Oh, I thought he/she was reaching for a weapon - oops - and they get away with murder.

Also, why do guns have to be fatal?  Why can't they be like tranquilizer guns?

James Brady's death is considered a homicide 33 years after - the INTENT should determine the punishment regardless of whether the victim is actually six feet under as intended.",1407542400,,1753,4.291793313069909
8600726,4,B00E3SLZ22,"The reporter asks the question: ""Didn't anyone see a sign?""  And you do wonder.  I gave this four stars because the acting is so brilliant, but held back from five because I too found the fragmented story telling damaged the impact.  I know the director was trying for different perspectives, but at times it didn't work. Especially when the scenes involved young children looking on, or an adult remembering back to childhood.  I couldn't tell which I was seeing and it left questions unanswered. There was an implication that the shooter was not dead, this led to further searching on the part of the reporter...but made no sense.  Surely, after the death of the shooter, someone had to ID the body. Then there would be an autopsy.  It's standard. In autopsy they would have found bruising from the beating he had taken 24 hours before. This would have raised a red flag. But does it? Does the near suicide of one man reveal what happened to make the shooter snap? We never know. I realize this was more about the impact of the town and the lives of individuals. But in the end it felt unfinished.",1502064000,,1099,4.581632653061225
8600727,4,B00E3SLZ22,"Not for everyone perhaps, but I liked the challenge of keeping up with the story from the different perspectives.  Overall a thought provoking well- acted movie.",1484697600,,161,5.1923076923076925
8600728,3,B00E3SLZ22,"As with most programmes from Channel 4, this 2013 four-parter is rather off beat.  It has the bleak, atmospheric tones of Hinterland, Broadchurch and Wallander but falls short of successfully telling a good story.  It bounces around viewpoints and time often to the point of confusion; there's no conclusion, it just ends.  I needed the subtitles to follow Sean Harris' mumbling.  Still, it wasn't a total waste of time and money and better than most offerings from the US.",1446940800,,473,4.949367088607595
8600729,4,B00E3SLZ22,"very good writing/acting/directing and not nicely wrapped, I found it engaging and will there be a 2nd season?  not sure how that would work",1443744000,,140,4.833333333333333
8600730,1,B00E3SLZ22,"Dreary, back-and-forth, confusing. No conclusion.",1440028800,,49,9.0
8600731,3,B00E3SLZ22,"This type of video, of mass shootings, has been done better. It is not terrible but it opens in a fairly depressing fashion. Our would be shooter is shown in many scenes with his aged parent and the terrible shape she is in and his barely coping with that. Then we get different points of view and shifting times to take in the story so we are seeing it from multi angles.

This is tricky to do in films and those who do it best have laser like precision in setting up and cutting their scenes. The director here does not have that excellent an eye for doing it. He should have stuck to a direct story arc instead. By contrast, director Gus Van Sant, made a film about a mass shooting and used the same devices but he is such an expert director that you knew where you were at every second and it never dragged for a single second. This was ""Elephant"" and was based on Columbine. This show, by contrast, drags quite a bit and especially at the opening. That is usually a very bad sign for a film-not knowing how to open it well.

Again, I can't say it is terrible but it has been done so much better. Another film which was superbly done about a shooter killing people in San Francisco was ""Zodiac"".  Again, not a wasted second. I would recommend you see those two films before spending time with this one.",1431820800,,1306,4.258064516129032
8600732,4,B00E3SLZ22,"My wife and I have watched the first two episodes.  The first was thefts, but both are great.  The film is very beautifully shot and the takes are unusually long--often over ten seconds.  We watched it on netflix, and I was initially confused by the  cover and the text.  The cover shows the villain, not the the repeater mentioned in the text.  And it is not clear he really is the violin.  The first shooter at the beginning is not identifiable (he is seen only in long shot) and the character on the cover is shown killing people but later shown to have hallucinated the murders.  The pacing is extremely slow, but the series is quite snagging.  The reporter is played by Rory Linear, who has done a lot of TV work and some hims, but is is perhaps not up to carrying the series.  He doesn't really enter the show until the second episode, which I we liked..",1430438400,,860,4.352201257861635
8600733,4,B00E3SLZ22,"Has anyone been able to locate or identify a complete playlist for this series? I'm enjoying the show quite a lot and I think the way music has been integrated into the plot and the characters is particularly effective. I recognize most of the tunes but it would be lovely if they'd put out a CD or at least a complete playlist. It's not on the wikipedia page, it's not on imdb, Spotify doesn't have it, and I've not been able to locate it anywhere.",1409097600,,449,4.294117647058823
8600734,3,B00E3SLZ22,"In Short: A mass shooting in the tiny town of Southcliffe throws the population into a nose dive. Local, Steve, takes out his anger and resentment, a result from his childhood, on any person who passes into his war path. Survivors deal with aftermath in many ways.

I was so excited to watch this when I read the premise. Then I was left feeling a bit disappointed. Here's why: This story is told from several angles. While it was interesting to see the complete picture, it felt overdone and sometimes insignificant. Maybe if it was shown from 2 or 3? It does show how the victims and survivors are all connected, but I think it could have been explained in a better, more interesting fashion. I was bored watching the same scene from several viewpoints.

Most of the production centered on connections between everyone. I was very grateful there isn't a lot of replay, if any, on the shootings. But most of the first 3 episodes focus on the same events from current to past. There is very little in the way of how the families and friends respond afterward. What they did show was sad, appropriately, but it was severely short.

Overall it was just okay for me. It lacked umph. Or perhaps watching scenes repeat made me overlook the place where you get grabbed. It wasn't terrible. Mediocre I think.",1409011200,,1301,4.599137931034483
