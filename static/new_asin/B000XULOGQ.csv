Do yourself a favor and watch this and King of Kong in the same weekend for a hilarious (and truly fascinating) does of nerdity overload.

To be fair, these ""LARPers"" sure have creative imaginations, and there are some genuinely touching moments in the film.  It's great to see how some of them have actually gained confidence or lose weight through their gaming, helping them in their other (real) lives...

But honestly, you haven't lived until you've seen a Dark Elf trying to buy a supernatural death poison with his pretend money.",1211932800,4,700,4.75206611570248
3009820,2,B000XULOGQ,There is no reason for this documentary to be as long as it is. An hour would have been sufficiently to covered the topic.,1205539200,3,122,4.125
3009821,5,B000XULOGQ,"Darkon follows the drama of a live action fantasy role playing game (LARP) with a sword and sorcery setting. The game depicted in the film is very similar to SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism) which recreates pre-17th century Western European history and culture. The plot focuses on in-game drama, both in live action battles and the role playing of diplomacy among the various player created nation-states. The documentary aspect cuts away from this in-game drama to explore the real lives of the players and look into their motivations for playing. A tension is created between the lives of players in-game and out-of-game especially when allegiances among the players shift.

The historic moment in-game that the film follows is similar to the plot of Braveheart. An imperialist empire, called Mordom (pronounced ""more dumb""), is controlling more and more and more territory and destroying or enslaving smaller nations for wealth and power in the name of freedom (hmmm...Mordom, kingdom, freedom). A small kingdom decides to fight this empire by forging an alliance among start-up and fallen states. In RL (real life) these rebels are low-wage workers, a single mom, stay-at-home dad, and Iraq vets. Those who lead the side of the empire in real life  are corporate white collar types. At one point a player in the rebel alliance comments that the Alliance is like the terrorists and Mordom is like America. The tension builds through the film in-game and out as the final battle approaches, one that determines the fate of the realms.

Darkon is extremely well edited and thought out. Like in other such live action games, like Vampire: The Masquerade LARP, the goal is to not let the rules of the game get in the way of the story. In the same way the film makers shoot and edit each scene so that the non-gamer can enjoy it perfectly fine, but there is tons for the hard core gamer as well. Interviews, especially with the players on the alliance side, tend to repeat the same reasons for playing the game, i.e. escape from a crappy life. This mantra adds to the in-game tension as it raises the stakes for victory. Intentionally, or not, the film has something to say about societies losers and winners, and who are the real heroes.",1205366400,2,2243,4.881889763779528
3009822,4,B000XULOGQ,"Being a fan of documentaries first and foremost, and knowing very little about live-action role-playing games, I have to say that the very subject itself was surprisingly unique and portrayed in a straight-forward non-judgmental fashion.  For that, I enjoyed Darkon tremendously.  I am partially familiar with the same sub-culture that quotes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monty-Python/dp/B00005O3VC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monty Python</a>&nbsp;incessantly and throws around&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/multi-sided-die/dp/0786950633/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">multi-sided die</a>.  In fact, at some stages in my life I've been among them with great enthusiasm.  Let me just say that I do believe the filmmakers behind Darkon to be genuinely interested and respectful of their documentary's subject, but that doesn't automatically make the scenes of grown men stumbling about through a soccer field in suits of armor, taunting one another in melodramatic accents, any less comical.  To me, the way the action is framed here in this film shows that the creators take it as seriously as the live-action role-players themselves.  I wouldn't want to be introduced to this subject in any other way, so good for them.

Darkon is a Wargaming Club in Baltimore, Maryland.  By this, I mean that it is a group of people who go away for the weekend to role-play with one another while dressing up in the traditional RPG medieval garb.  The documentary goes over several in-game conflicts in great detail and features some closer looks at some relevant players, both in the game and outside of the game.  Darkon isn't just a bunch of people running around hitting each other with sword-shaped pillows either, there are very specific rules in Darkon and how seriously the players seem to take these rules is remarkable.  The film really offered some decent insights into why people escape from reality, why people enjoy role-playing, and how they might justify it philosophically.  This movie could've easily fallen in danger of exploiting its subject and at times it could be perceived as doing so, but I'm not convinced that is intentional.  This documentary is good for live-action role-playing, as it seems to want its audience to understand the attraction.  I used to play Dungeons and Dragons and I still enjoy video games now and then, so it wasn't really difficult for me to both enjoy and respect what these people are up to.  On the other hand, some people might watch Darkon and just laugh at and judge its subject, and for them I wouldn't recommend it.

Overall, I definitely recommend Darkon if the subject is an interest to you, if you're interested in knowing more about the subject, or even just knowing why people do this sort of thing.  I watched it with my wife who was kind of mocking them at first, which I discouraged.  By the end she was dreaming of going away for a weekend and pretending to be a Elven princess, which I encouraged.  A good buy overall and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvish/dp/0905220102/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvish</a>&nbsp;is conveniently subtitled.",1204243200,10,3232,5.654244306418219
3009823,2,B000XULOGQ,"Darkon (Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel, 2005)

One review I read of Darkon recently defends the movie by saying that (forgive my paraphrasing) it doesn't make fun of its subjects, that it is an apologetic rather than being apologetic. I saw it in quite the opposite light; it seems much more the case to me that the filmmakers here gave the subjects of the movie just enough rope, and they fashioned some pretty gaudy nooses with it.

Darkon, named after the live-action wargaming club it documents, shows us some of the principal players and traces one of the game's plot lines. We get a number of interviews with players, all of them sounding distressingly similar: ""the real world is just not a place where I fit in. In the game, I'm a different person."" Which is, of course, an entirely valid viewpoint-- substitute guns and cannons for the padded weaponry and you've got civil war re-enactors-- but it's the sheer volume of the interviews that tips this over the line from serious study to poking fun. Whether this was intentional on the part of the filmmakers or a simple bout of amateurishness I don't know. Figuring out what to cut, especially when your movie is already only barely topping ninety minutes, can be a tough task.

The storyline we follow is a great deal more interesting, and it is here where the film tips its hand that this was meant to be a serious study. There was great thought given to the way it unfolds in the film; we get the idea early on that years have gone into the preparation for this storyline, and the filmmakers show their talent in their ability to capture all that in a relatively small amount of screen time, getting us up to speed and telling us what we need to know with no bloat at all. When the film is focused on the story going on within Darkon, as opposed to the story of Darkon, it's a great deal of fun.

In the end, I have to put my ultimate dissatisfaction with the film in the hands of the filmmakers, not their subjects. I can only surmise that the reason for the inclusion of so many repetitive interviews was, given the film's length, as filler; a shorter movie may not have been desirable from a marketing standpoint, but it would have done wonders for the quality. As it is now, though, I can't recommend it. **",1199318400,14,2268,4.4842615012106535
3009824,5,B000XULOGQ,"I've never been into fantasy books, board games or computer games.  So I know I'm not the intended audience for this film.  Still, I found it fascinating.  The filmmakers did a great job chronicling a story line in this live action role playing game as contrasted with the real lives of the those who play it.  From an outsider's perspective, the complexity and depth of this game is very interesting.  The players find real enjoyment in the game...it's not your typical fantasy, as the players do appear to get quite a workout in some of their battles.

I can't say this film made me want to be a gamer, but I've found a new respect from those who play it.",1196294400,9,657,4.433333333333334
3009825,4,B000XULOGQ,"One of the few non-comedic movies by gamers, about gamers, and ultimately for gamers, Darkon (Ovie Productions/Seethink Productions, 2006) is a documentary that focuses on the activities of the Darkon Wargaming Club, a fantasy live-action role-playing (LARP) group in Baltimore, Maryland.

Moreso than movies of any sort by non-gamers about role-playing gaming (e.g., the execrable Mazes and Monsters), Darkon explores the purposes, positive aspects, and benefits of the hobby and the motives people have for participating in it. While it also hints at the all-consuming effect RPGs can have on their participants, it is ultimately more of an apologia for the hobby than an examination of it.

From a technical point of view, Darkon is well filmed, excellently scored, and structurally sound. One thing it does not do, however, is explain what a LARP is. Naturally, this does not matter much as far as gamers are concerned, but the absence of such explanation severely limits the value this film could have had as a tool for telling the non-gaming world about something about which it has limited awareness and little understanding. It is also a little on the long side, with multiple, interchangeable battle scenes, some of which could have been cut in lieu of some interviews with some third parties who could have helped put LARPing and RPGing in context.

A product of its times, Darkon draws as much on the genre of reality television as it does on that of documentary, with asides to the camera by its various subjects that shed light on their motivations and relationships in and out of the game. Depending on whether one likes reality TV or not, this could be seen as either a benefit or a detriment.

Some of the costuming and props used by the Darkon LARPers are impressive, with especial kudos going to the Dark Elf reenactors (who do not appear in the film nearly enough). Firing catapults and a wooden fortress that is actually burned at the end of a battle demonstrate the willingness of this club's members to go above and beyond in their gaming.

Overall, Darkon is worth a watch by anyone interested in seeing a particular side of the gaming genre. It is likely, however, to be just as confusing as it is enlightening to outsiders, and does not go nearly as far as it could toward producing an understanding of the hobby to those not already familiar with it.

Darkon is 93 minutes long. It premiered and won the Best Documentary Audience Award at the 2006 South By Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas, and is an official selection playing at the Hot Docs, Maryland Film Festival, Silverdocs, LA Film Festival, Britdoc and Melbourne International Film Festival.

3009832,4,B000XULOGQ,"This surprisingly well shot and edited documentary takes a fair and serious look at LARPers (Live Action Role Players), their real lives, and their motivations for putting so much devotion into Darkon, the name this Maryland LARP community gave their gaming ""world."" Intertwined with these individual portraits is the unfolding story of the Darkon, um, ""realm."" At the center of this tale is a  King of Kong like focus on two warring factions. One faction, led by a stay-at-home dad, unites the other nations to rise in battle against Darkon's only superpower.

I won't lie, there are some genuine cringe-worthy moments (mostly those pre-battle ceremonies). Yet by the film's final battle, I actually found myself caring enough about the real people behind the fictional armies that I was genuinely invested in the outcome. No small feat for those of us raised on films and TV with flawless special effects and $100 million budgets.

Anyone that's a fan of character studies and real human pathos should enjoy this film--definitely make it a rental at least. And those people that are gamers or into the fantasy genre on any level will probably love and relate to it on a whole other level and want to add it to their collection.",1342051200,,1229,4.899038461538462

I absolutely LOVED this documentary, at times I felt pity for the characters, at times I did nothing but laugh at what at the time I perceived as a pathetic hobby but in the end I honestly envied these characters and their unique world. This film is artfully directed and despite what many may think takes what would normally be portrayed as a pathetic ""geek"" pass-time and makes it something I actually wish I belonged too!",1266019200,,484,4.511363636363637
3009835,4,B000XULOGQ,"This is a documentary about a group of ""Dungeons-and-Dragons"" type gamers in Baltimore. I've caught bits and bobs of it a few times on IFC, never from the beginning though, but I was home from work sick, there was nothing else on and it was just starting, so I tuned in. Well, what a fascinating surprise this turned out to be. Although I wasn't sure where they were going with it until nearly the end of the film, I'm glad I stuck it out. Kudos to the filmmakers.

I've always been interested in ""nerd"" culture. Primarily because I consider myself an honorary member of a few geeky fandom sub-cultures - The Avengers, Star Trek (a wee bit - due to my sister), Rocky Horror, The Prisoner, Renaissance Faires, slash fiction in general......you get the idea. In the past, documentaries I've seen about geeks seemed to lack a strong point of view - ""Trekkies"" and ""Trekkies II"" sent out the vague message that not all geeks are losers and that the Star Trek fandom spawned some successful tech-heads with futuristic ideas. Big deal. ""Goth Cruise"" proved to be even more formless. I couldn't figure out the point of it at all, except perhaps to show the world that Goths are just really nice people in weird outfits. Well, all righty then.

In brief, ""Darkon"" follows the leaders of two separate counties in the ""kingdom"" Darkon - an anachronistic fantasy realm that has its boundaries in modern day Baltimore. In addition to chronicling the events that lead up to the epic battle between the two counties, we are also given glimpses into the real lives of the two main players. Bannor of Laconia (Skip Lipman) is a short and paunchy stay-at-home Dad who, in his spare time, plots an uprising against the powerful Lord Keldar of Mordum (Kenyon Wells) a tall, blonde and successful IT Manager. Throughout the film we see Lipman food shopping, vacuuming and minding his children, while his wife goes off to work; a stark contrast to the bellowing warrior he plays in Darkon. We also have brief glimpses of Wells sitting in his nicely appointed home or office discussing the people skills he employs as a leader both in Darkon and at work. But it is only near the very end that the filmmakers reveal a backstory that sheds light on ""Bannor's"" quest to overcome the imperialistic ""Keldar.""  A story that, sadly, also foreshadows his inevitable defeat.

In addition to Bannor and Keldar, there is an abundance of interview footage with the underlings - lieutenants, wenches and foot soldiers - who make up the bulk of the secondary players. One character, shown crawling on all fours on the battle field, recounts how he initially wore cardboard armour and was ridiculed by the other players but, after reincarnating himself as another character, was determined to win their respect. Later, he details being shunned at school for carrying around a list of students (which he insists was completely innocent) that was reminiscent of the lists made by the Columbine killers and, later still, he describes his desire to vanquish demanding customers at the Starbucks where he works as a barista.

Basically, the film suggests that people tend to rise to their own level in all their interactions with others. Be it in the ""real"" world or a fantasy environment. Even though all the players tout Darkon as a way to fulfill their own personal fantasies of greatness, the roles they assume and level of success they achieve in Darkon tends to mirror that of their real life. Because Darkon isn't a fantasy in the purest sense (taking place in the mind of a solitary individual), the participants still have to suffer the consequences of their social shortcomings. In the game, as in life, the most charismatic individuals are the most successful.

Although it is a bit overlong, ""Darkon,"" like the best documentaries, is a wonderful character study and offers a cogent examination of the human condition.",1247529600,4,3887,4.828828828828829

It is also a little on the long side, with multiple, interchangeable battle scenes, some of which could have been cut in lieu of some interviews with some third parties who could have helped put LARPing and RPGing in context.

A product of its times, Darkon draws as much on the genre of reality television as it does on that of documentary, with asides to the camera by its various subjects that shed light on their motivations and relationships in and out of the game. Depending on whether one likes reality TV or not, this could be seen as either a benefit or a detriment.

Some of the costuming and props used by the Darkon LARPers are impressive, with especial kudos going to the Dark Elf reenactors (who do not appear in the film nearly enough). Firing catapults and a wooden fortress that is actually burned at the end of a battle demonstrate the willingness of this club's members to go above and beyond in their gaming.

Overall, Darkon is worth a watch by anyone interested in seeing a particular side of the gaming genre. It is likely, however, to be just as confusing as it is enlightening to outsiders, and does not go nearly as far as it could toward producing an understanding of the hobby to those not already familiar with it.

Darkon is 93 minutes long. It premiered and won the Best Documentary Audience Award at the 2006 South By Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas, and is an official selection playing at the Hot Docs, Maryland Film Festival, Silverdocs, LA Film Festival, Britdoc and Melbourne International Film Festival.

3244329,4,B000XULOGQ,"This surprisingly well shot and edited documentary takes a fair and serious look at LARPers (Live Action Role Players), their real lives, and their motivations for putting so much devotion into Darkon, the name this Maryland LARP community gave their gaming ""world."" Intertwined with these individual portraits is the unfolding story of the Darkon, um, ""realm."" At the center of this tale is a  King of Kong like focus on two warring factions. One faction, led by a stay-at-home dad, unites the other nations to rise in battle against Darkon's only superpower.

I won't lie, there are some genuine cringe-worthy moments (mostly those pre-battle ceremonies). Yet by the film's final battle, I actually found myself caring enough about the real people behind the fictional armies that I was genuinely invested in the outcome. No small feat for those of us raised on films and TV with flawless special effects and $100 million budgets.

Anyone that's a fan of character studies and real human pathos should enjoy this film--definitely make it a rental at least. And those people that are gamers or into the fantasy genre on any level will probably love and relate to it on a whole other level and want to add it to their collection.",1342051200,,1229,4.899038461538462

This film is artfully directed and despite what many may think takes what would normally be portrayed as a pathetic ""geek"" pass-time and makes it something I actually wish I belonged too!",1266019200,,484,4.511363636363637
3244332,4,B000XULOGQ,"This is a documentary about a group of ""Dungeons-and-Dragons"" type gamers in Baltimore. I've caught bits and bobs of it a few times on IFC, never from the beginning though, but I was home from work sick, there was nothing else on and it was just starting, so I tuned in. Well, what a fascinating surprise this turned out to be. Although I wasn't sure where they were going with it until nearly the end of the film, I'm glad I stuck it out. Kudos to the filmmakers.

I've always been interested in ""nerd"" culture. Primarily because I consider myself an honorary member of a few geeky fandom sub-cultures - The Avengers, Star Trek (a wee bit - due to my sister), Rocky Horror, The Prisoner, Renaissance Faires, slash fiction in general......you get the idea. In the past, documentaries I've seen about geeks seemed to lack a strong point of view - ""Trekkies"" and ""Trekkies II"" sent out the vague message that not all geeks are losers and that the Star Trek fandom spawned some successful tech-heads with futuristic ideas. Big deal. ""Goth Cruise"" proved to be even more formless. I couldn't figure out the point of it at all, except perhaps to show the world that Goths are just really nice people in weird outfits. Well, all righty then.

In brief, ""Darkon"" follows the leaders of two separate counties in the ""kingdom"" Darkon - an anachronistic fantasy realm that has its boundaries in modern day Baltimore. In addition to chronicling the events that lead up to the epic battle between the two counties, we are also given glimpses into the real lives of the two main players. Bannor of Laconia (Skip Lipman) is a short and paunchy stay-at-home Dad who, in his spare time, plots an uprising against the powerful Lord Keldar of Mordum (Kenyon Wells) a tall, blonde and successful IT Manager. Throughout the film we see Lipman food shopping, vacuuming and minding his children, while his wife goes off to work; a stark contrast to the bellowing warrior he plays in Darkon. We also have brief glimpses of Wells sitting in his nicely appointed home or office discussing the people skills he employs as a leader both in Darkon and at work. But it is only near the very end that the filmmakers reveal a backstory that sheds light on ""Bannor's"" quest to overcome the imperialistic ""Keldar.""  A story that, sadly, also foreshadows his inevitable defeat.

In addition to Bannor and Keldar, there is an abundance of interview footage with the underlings - lieutenants, wenches and foot soldiers - who make up the bulk of the secondary players. One character, shown crawling on all fours on the battle field, recounts how he initially wore cardboard armour and was ridiculed by the other players but, after reincarnating himself as another character, was determined to win their respect. Later, he details being shunned at school for carrying around a list of students (which he insists was completely innocent) that was reminiscent of the lists made by the Columbine killers and, later still, he describes his desire to vanquish demanding customers at the Starbucks where he works as a barista.

Basically, the film suggests that people tend to rise to their own level in all their interactions with others. Be it in the ""real"" world or a fantasy environment. Even though all the players tout Darkon as a way to fulfill their own personal fantasies of greatness, the roles they assume and level of success they achieve in Darkon tends to mirror that of their real life. Because Darkon isn't a fantasy in the purest sense (taking place in the mind of a solitary individual), the participants still have to suffer the consequences of their social shortcomings. In the game, as in life, the most charismatic individuals are the most successful.

Although it is a bit overlong, ""Darkon,"" like the best documentaries, is a wonderful character study and offers a cogent examination of the human condition.",1247529600,4,3887,4.828828828828829
8230013,4,B000XULOGQ,"This is HYSTERICAL!! It took me a good while to realize that this wasn't a parody but rather a snippet from some folks' lives who actually dress up and play at being fantasy characters. It's really, really well done, very well produced, and very entertaining. There were some mildly painful moments where I felt so embarrassed for some of these pathetic medieval morons that I was tempted to stop watching, but I'm glad I didn't', and the contrast between their fantasy life and the realities of living in suburbia as grade school dropouts working meaningless jobs and playing dress ito make believe to obtain some sense of fulfillment and purpose was superbly done.

What can you really say about ""Darkon""? Not much if you don't really have any exposure to the societies it's based on. I grew up in martial arts, HBO constantly ran made for HBO special features about barbarians and underground tournaments where fighting to the death was the name of the game. Over my time in Dojos as a kid, before everything moved to fight gyms, I encountered a lot of ""these people"".

Most of them are weird asocial personalities until you tap an interest, which would often send them flying into tangential stories and ravings. In my case it was always about some secret martial art they knew, or big stories about their ancestors being dragon hunters.

As you age, these guys do too, some of them become serial rapists, some of them join the SCA or other similar groups, some take to both. They're all largely, honestly, pathetic people, and I'm a little bothered so many of you watched this and extracted that it's about ""gamers"". It's not, it's about delusional narcissists who are willing to ignore their real ""mundane"" lives in favor of running around in the forest and pretending to be elves.

I have a friend I grew up with who is a self taught graphics designer and animator, as well as self taught leather worker and costume wizard. He's amazing, it's a love for him. His parents died when he was young, everyone he knows has taken advantage of him, and he's grown from it very well. He's a rarity to still be involved in this messy way of life.

The people in this documentary should be pitied, not identified with.",1480291200,2,1664,4.545150501672241

The thing this movie does best is allow the people involved to tell their own story but what happens next is that the filmmakers edit it into a narrative story that is entertaining apart from it being informative.
