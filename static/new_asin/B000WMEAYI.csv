2987182,4,B000WMEAYI,"""Crawlspace"" is a wonderful film.

It is about an aging childless married couple
living in a rural setting on the outskirts
of a small town who befriend a troubled
transient homeless young man
whom they ""allow"" to live in a crawl-space
in their basement with the intension
of helping him.

Despite their best efforts and in part due
to the bad behavior of other locals,
the young man is unable to overcome
his psychological problems which appear
to have their root in past betrayal
and abandonment.

This is not a terror/horror movie,
properly speaking.
It is more like a tragedy.

It illuminates the potential of charity to redeem
and the destructive unintended consequences
of the lack of charity.

""Crawlspace"" is not a dry psychological study.
It is very entertaining and does have
some tense and scary moments.

The first thing I did when I finished watching the movie was to google it to find out if it was a video game tie in. It isn't, but it the story definitely reminded me of some of the better, well written sci-fi survival horror games. It also has Japanese Anime Sci-fi vibe as well.

We have the elite military team sent in to clean up the mess, with test subjects to be eliminated, internal security to be neutralized and civilian scientists to be rescued.

I think people who enjoy sci-fi survival horror in movies, video games and anime may enjoy this movie. Those who have no experience in the sub-genre may have no idea what's going on here, while I got it right from the start and even predicted some things in advance due to my familiarity with the genre.

2987205,2,B000WMEAYI,"Deep beneath the Australian Outback lies Area 52, a secret research facility that the government doesn't want you to know about. Here, experiments in human biomechanics have unleashed the ultimate weapon... And one that Australia's top special forces agents will be unprepared to face as they enter the facility on a seek and destroy mission! CRAWLSPACE attempts to combine CUBE's suffocating mood with the psychological terror of PATRICK or THE SENDER, although it falls short in either department. Writer/Director Justin Dix relies far too heavily on a twist ending which has been blatantly broadcast from very early on. This makes for very little suspense and minimal guesswork as the audience wades through an all-too-familiar plot and predictable characters. CRAWLSPACE does come through with a few commendable moments of supreme tension as the characters face their darkest fears within the close confines of the tunnels, but these are short-lived. The added gore, claustrophobic sets, and winning make-up designs do work to the film's advantage as well, however. With a stronger character base and a greater exploration of the villain's near-limitless powers, CRAWLSPACE may have had more room to succeed, but it becomes easily trapped by its own narrow aspirations.

Here, experiments in human biomechanics have unleashed the ultimate weapon... And one that Australia's top special forces agents will be unprepared to face as they enter the facility on a seek and destroy mission! CRAWLSPACE attempts to combine CUBE's suffocating mood with the psychological terror of PATRICK or THE SENDER, although it falls short in either department. Writer/Director Justin Dix relies far too heavily on a twist ending which has been blatantly broadcast from very early on. This makes for very little suspense and minimal guesswork as the audience wades through an all-too-familiar plot and predictable characters. CRAWLSPACE does come through with a few commendable moments of supreme tension as the characters face their darkest fears within the close confines of the tunnels, but these are short-lived. The added gore, claustrophobic sets, and winning make-up designs do work to the film's advantage as well, however. With a stronger character base and a greater exploration of the villain's near-limitless powers, CRAWLSPACE may have had more room to succeed, but it becomes easily trapped by its own narrow aspirations.

8224185,4,B000WMEAYI,"A lot of the reviews here are not relevant to this film. There appears to be some confusion with Crawlspace, an American tv movie from '72 and an Australian scifi movie, perhaps by the same name? This is a character-driven story of an older childless couple who end up with a deranged man living in their crawlspace. I saw it many years ago and it stayed with me all this time. This movie is unique for its time, particularly as a tv movie, a blend of character study and horror suspense.  It's creepy, but maybe too slow for some. The acting was excellent. Probably ahead of its time as it reminds me of a lot of the '90s indie films with that weird vibe and freaky concept that got under your skin.",1518480000,,700,4.303030303030303

8224188,3,B000WMEAYI,I had been watching this film for a while in my wish list and had great expectations.  A bit predictable mixing a few different styles of premises together.  Not a bad way to spend an hour or so but not the greatest film I have ever seen.,1483315200,,238,4.042553191489362

8224192,3,B000WMEAYI,"I love movies like this.  In the beginning the movie reminded me a bit of the Cube movies -- something disasterous has occured but we're not quite sure of what or even where we are.  A military operation has been mounted to rescue scientists and kill escaped and dangerous prisoners (sort of like Alien or Aliens).  At first this is done really well.  And then the writers ran out of steam, or imagination.  I recommend this as a rental if you are really hard up for things to watch or just need to see something along the lines of Sci Fi/Horror.  The ending seemed to hold out promise for a sequel, and all I can say is, God forbid.",1435449600,,633,4.277310924369748
