8496689,5,B006DFOMCS,"In so very many cases, it is the really big, ambitious films that emerge from wildly chaotic production circumstances.  One might imagine that, when so much investment is on the line, the pre-production planning and organizing would be sufficiently thorough to minimize the possibility of everything falling apart.  This documentary is an astounding examination of film-making that goes insanely out of control.  Coppola was obviously so unnerved and rattled by the ordeal that, upon completion of the movie, he was largely unable to assess the end result.  Despite all of the subsequent acclaim and awards that it garnered, ""Apocalypse Now"" struck him as a failure.  This documentary is horrifyingly fascinating.",1522022400,,713,5.445454545454545

8496691,4,B006DFOMCS,"But I can only award for stars because this documentary is now impossible to find with American DVD encoding. Yes, that gives this film the feeling of being a classified document that requires special equipment to access but that also makes this product mildly annoying, hence the four star rating.",1500076800,,298,4.98
