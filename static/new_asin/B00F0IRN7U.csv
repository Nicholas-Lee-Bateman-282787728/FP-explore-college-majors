5962165,3,B00F0IRN7U,"This collection is packed with hours of content with a great aesthetic. The big problem is every film in color has tons of visual issues, with colors just disappearing and reappearing...it gets distracting and is quite frankly ridiculous for how much you pay.",1397001600,7,259,5.046511627906977
5962166,4,B00F0IRN7U,"I was a bit worried that the set was from the UK, but they played fine on my US-region player ...I just have to get used-to the navigation menus - which are at least uniform in this package. Good job Universal-Europe!

I won't bloviate on the content ...why spend the extra $ on repeating a collection I already have on BR & DVD if you don't already love the content legacy of this great master. I never ""watch"" the Oscars, but rather spend the day with ""Hitch"" out of protest for that pop-culture ""Academy"" having never awarding him a statue.",1392595200,7,543,4.43
5962167,5,B00F0IRN7U,An excellent collection for Hitchcock lovers. it's amazing the quality and all the extras that it contains. Can't miss it,1390348800,,121,5.1
5962168,5,B00F0IRN7U,"This being a world record price for a box-set I believe it has earned a glowing review. My previous world record was walking out of my local Supermarket in January 2005 having paid 49.97 for the Lord of the Rings Extended production. The same price was also paid for Band of Brothers complete with tin box, like soldiers used to carry.

It was for aesthetic reasons as much as any other for me purchasing The Ultimate Hitchcock. Proudly perched beneath my plasma upon a thick glass shelf it says: 'feck off Spielberg, cop-for-that Scorsese and the rest.' Only David Lean and Stanley Kubrick can live with this movie CV. Posthumously.

I've had Hitchcock on VHS (those great black covers) and on various dvds (those crappy two-tone covers). But they never got watched. Only the big three movies: North by Northwest, Vertigo and Rear Window had repeated viewings where I live. It was not until I got a projector and 100' screen that I wandered into blu ray Hitchcock territory.

I have rediscovered cinema whilst sat at home. There are many options for Hitchcock blu ray. It can not be denied that money will be your main driver for your decision. But I urge you to find a space on your credit card for this blu ray collection. It's beautiful.

I watched the first movie last night. I found that my decision to buy blu ray Hitchcock had been more than vindicated. You may think a story about sabotage in a second world war airplane factory in the USA would be old hat. But the tight corners the man and woman find themselves in WILL have you on the edge of your sofa wondering how they will get out of this or that situation. Real suspense. And the dialogue does resonate with today. It was only last night that I realized that people in the 1930s and 1940s were what we now term 'radicalized.' Rich people were the enemy.

On the practical front the box is 7' high by 6' deep and 14' long. Each disc within each tin is padded with foam both sides. The paperwork looks a bit naff at first appraisal but the booklet may be worth a read. I can only see running time information on the cardboard enclosure: I'm not sure how to keep this since it is best removed from the box-set for final placement.

As gorgeous as his female leads, this 16 movie collection has 'Hitchcock' for the last word in great cinema.",1389830400,9,2304,4.486873508353222
5962169,5,B00F0IRN7U,Just perfect! The package is very impressive and is truly a collectors set. My son loved his gift. Exactly what he wanted.,1388880000,2,122,4.590909090909091
5962170,5,B00F0IRN7U,"It is probably pointless to order ""Alfred Hitchcock: The Masterpiece Collection-Limited Edition"" now that Universal launched a new box set,
""The Ultimate Filmmaker Collection"". The new set costs about $40  less than the old one ( prices at the date of this review)
and it has two more films, ""To Catch a Thief"" and ""North by Northwest"".

This is the reason why I rated ""The Masterpiece"" as three stars, although it is really a five stars set. The point is, how could I write a review recommending ""Masterpiece"" if there is a new set that is better ?
Reviews about films on Amazon are supposed to be a guide that might help customers to decide about ordering a product or not.
If you don't already have the set ""The Masterpiece Collection"", then there is no doubt that it is better to order ""The Ultimate Filmmaker Collection"".

If you already have the first set and is considering to get the second, newest one then you could always make an excellent Christmas present of the first set or donate
it to charity. I thought in sell my old set and checked Momox but the price they pay for it is surrealist: 2.32 ( I originally wrote this review for Amazon UK )

Here I will outline the main differences between both sets, hoping that the information will be useful to other customers.

1. ""The Ultimate"" has two more films, ""To Catch a Thief"" and ""North by Northwest"". The quality of images is very good but the night scenes of ""To Catch a Thief"" are green...
The disc ""To Catch a Thief"" has no label with photo of the film, what singles it out from all other discs. That was some sloppy work of Universal. In addition, there are no extra features in ""To Catch a Thief"",
unlike all other films of the set, where you can find excellent extra features such as interviews with Hitchcock's daughter, actors, writers and so on.

2. ""The Ultimate"" has a considerably better price. I am considering here Amazon's price. If by any chance you get a faulty set or just change your mind then it is very easy to deal with Amazon whilst, based on several
practical experiences,  I can't say the same about sellers.

3. Both boxes have about the same height and length but ""The Ultimate"" has more than twice the width of ""The Masterpiece"". You will need more space for the new set. The oldest box seems more elegant to me
and they occupy half the space of the new box. There is a drawing of ""The Birds"" on the box of the old collection whilst the new box has a design of ""Vertigo"". The drawing of ""Vertigo"", unlike the one
from ""The Birds"", could be a drawing from many other films and it is not so much of a ""trademark"" as ""The Birds"" is.

4. There were many complaints about the discs being put inside paper slots in ""The Masterpiece"". It looks like Universal listened to those complaints because the films in ""The Ultimate"" come inside a nice metal case
that looks like a film can. The case has a soft styrofoam on both of its internal sides what makes for very good protection to each disc.

5. The extras such as booklet, film posters and so on are basically the same in ""Masterpiece"" and ""Ultimate"". Both sets have a collection of 14 (Masterpiece) or 16 (Ultimate) movie poster cards of each film. They also have a small booklet , replicas of letters and storyboards. ""The Masterpiece"" has eight costume cards that are not present in the new edition.

6. I was hoping that Universal would improve, in the new edition, the quality of copies such as ""Marnie"" but they didn't. The discs are exactly the same. The images in ""Marnie"" are good but they are not up
to blu ray standards. Even if the transfer of some of the films to blu ray wasn't to a high standard it doesn't mean that the images are
bad, unwatchable. They are good and they are better than their dvds' counterparts. ""Frenzy"", for example, looks much better on blu ray than on dvd.

7. It is much easier to handle the discs from the new collection, ""The Ultimate"", as each film has its own case. The discs are also better protected what would be the main reason why customers who were unhappy
with the placement of discs in paper slots, as they are on the first set, would consider ordering this set. Each metal case has the film title on the front and on the side making it very easy to find what you are looking for.
The films are in order of their year's production, like in the older set.

8. I checked the blu ray disc ""To Catch a Thief"" and Amazon is selling it for 7.50. That disc has several extra features, unlike the one in this collection. I wonder why.

Both box sets are, as far as I know, the best sets of films on disc ever made. It is definitely worth ordering the collection, even if you have
Hitchcock's films on dvd, because the blu ray discs are of better quality than the dvds and
are put together in cleverly, beautifully designed boxes.

I still didn't decide if I will keep the new set and will get rid of the old one or if I will return the new set but, if you don't have the first set then the newest one is definitely the best choice because of price, number of films and
quality of cases. It is just a shame that they did such a poor job with ""To Catch a Thief"" in the new box set, ""The Ultimate Filmmaker Collection"".

It is an easy guess that everybody considering this set have already watched most of its films but we can always come back to Hitchcock, reason why he is one of the great masters of cinema. Away from noisy crowds and smelly food
that now populate cinemas, you can watch Hitchcock's movies with blu ray quality ( mostly... ) in your home.

The sets have a few faults. I know that and pointed them out but the main thing is that both sets are of unique quality and they really are extraordinary.
Thank you, Universal, for all the work and care shown in the excellent ""Masterpiece"" and ""Ultimate"" sets.

Winter is coming and, as film experiences go, there is nothing like watching Hitchcock in a rainy, cold day, whilst having tea and cakes and biscuits
and blueberry jam...",1387324800,57,5968,4.400181488203267
