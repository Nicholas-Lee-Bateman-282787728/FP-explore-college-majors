2643991,5,B000HWZ4UW,"This is possibly the only HBO comedy special that you can sit down, get a good laugh, and watch it with your grandmother.

Sinbad touches on growing up in a generation where you didn't need or want to know what ""or Else"" meant.  It's about time this made it to DVD.",1185235200,2,265,4.176470588235294
2644078,3,B000HWZ4UW,Redceived very timely.  The dvd was ok and funny.  I was expecting more comedy from Sinbad. I do like the fact that there was children in attendance which made it better.,1384041600,,170,4.451612903225806
2644079,5,B000HWZ4UW,SINBAD IS ONE OF A FEW COMEDIANS THAT DOES A GENERAL AUDIENCE PERFORMANCE.  I SEARCH FOR VIDEOS THAT ARE CLEAN FOR VIEWING WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN.,1377129600,,145,4.8
2644080,2,B000HWZ4UW,My review has nothing to do with the product because it was in very good condition.  I simply found it boring.,1375747200,,110,4.238095238095238
2644081,4,B000HWZ4UW,My son and I I love to watch comedy movies. This is another to add to our ever growing collection.,1362873600,,98,3.95
2644082,4,B000HWZ4UW,Like Sinbad because he is not an explicit comedian and he still is funny and talented.  Makes me laugh alot.,1362355200,,108,4.4
2644083,5,B000HWZ4UW,"Sinbad is always refreshing.  His comedy is clean, something the whole family can enjoy which is very rare these days.",1357084800,,118,4.9
2644084,5,B000HWZ4UW,Sinbad is hilarious. The quality of the dvd was great. It's a must see! This man will make you laugh. And it's suitable for children too.,1336003200,,137,4.3076923076923075
2644085,5,B000HWZ4UW,"This is the third time I have ordered a dvd through Amazon/cd imports.  I bought them for my husband who is very picky when it comes to his dvds, and he was very pleased with them.  I plan on buying more through them very soon!!! Oh and the price was awesome!",1329091200,,259,4.0588235294117645
2644086,5,B000HWZ4UW,"Sinbad is that rare comedian that has both the gift of telling hilarious stories as well as finding patterns among people. I have all of his DVD's except one that is only on VHS (sad face). If you love Sinbad's comedy, you'll love this DVD!",1323302400,,240,4.355555555555555
2644087,5,B000HWZ4UW,"He funny yall he funny. Sinbad Where you Been is pretty funny too, that is probably the funniest. Buy that one if you had to choose.",1320537600,,132,4.115384615384615
2644123,5,B000HWZ4UW,Sinbad is one of the few comedians that has the ability to make you laugh but still be family friendly.  He doesn't use swear words and his matieral is just hilarious. I recommend any of his videos.,1299974400,,198,4.351351351351352
2644124,5,B000HWZ4UW,"We as a family really enjoyed ""Afros and Bellbottoms.""
  It is so funnnnny",1299110400,,74,4.615384615384615
2644125,5,B000HWZ4UW,Of course I had to have this one too! Love Him! wish there were more out there like him!!!,1287100800,,90,3.789473684210526
2644126,3,B000HWZ4UW,"I saw this when it originally aired, and the DVD is missing a lot of material.",1286928000,2,78,3.9375
2644127,5,B000HWZ4UW,"Our family had enjoyed Sinbad when he had the HBO specials, my son still uses some of his lines! He was wanting his sons to see them and I especially like the G rating! Still funny even for my young grandsons!",1282003200,,209,4.121951219512195
2644128,4,B000HWZ4UW,"I was afraid this older routine might seem outdated. Not at all. Sinbad's comedy is timeless. Yes, I use the F bomb myself. But I must admit it's refreshing to watch a comedy show without it.",1269648000,,191,4.333333333333333
2644129,3,B000HWZ4UW,"I loved this special when it was on HBO. I loved all the Sinbad HBO specials. Unfortunately, they edited ""Son of a Preacher Man and Afros and Bellbottoms."" It is missing so much of the laughter.  The first time I saw the specials on HBO I was laughing and crying at the same time. Can they please re-release this uncut. I rather see the original.",1252540800,,346,4.323076923076923
2644130,5,B000HWZ4UW,"Sinbad was his crazy self, as usual. Gave myself a headache from laughing so hard. :)",1252281600,,85,4.375
2644131,2,B000HWZ4UW,"I, like other reviewers here, remember this masterpiece from the past on cable tv.  Who can imagine the reasons for the makers of it to chop the original, complete broadcast all up.  It is a very BIG disappointment for that reason alone, the performance is about as good as anyone could ever do, and perhaps the very best got cut.

For someone who does not remember what it was, it still very odd how it fades out and back in without continuity.  Probably just created a black market, underground distribution for the original with this release.",1240099200,6,545,4.645833333333333
2644132,3,B000HWZ4UW,"A lot of funny parts were cut for some reason, but still a great show. I have the entire Sinbad collection.",1237248000,2,107,4.142857142857143
2644163,4,B000HWZ4UW,"As always, Sinbad in a live performance takes down the house and with good clean humor. I am so glad someone thinks you can be funny without profanity.  Sinbad is that someone!!",1223510400,,177,4.53125
2644164,2,B000HWZ4UW,I bought this recently and I was so angry at what I seen. They cut out half of sinbads performance. And why?! This is a dvd they can jam pack it with all sorts of things. I should have known something was wrong by how light the dvd was. It's unfortunate that such a great performance was ruined by this medicore dvd. I urge anybody not to buy this just out of protest. I'm just so speechless. Until they put the whole performance on here nobody should buy this.,1209427200,4,461,4.191011235955056
2644165,5,B000HWZ4UW,"Sinbad took the mantle of Cosby and took it to the next generation. He shows you can be gut wrenching hilarious without being vulgar. And, he is not tame in his material. just honest. Keep up the good work, Sinbad. I know you've got more for us. Keep 'em coming.",1202169600,,262,4.26
2644166,3,B000HWZ4UW,"I have watched Sinbad: Son of a Preacher Man on tv, and this video is missing alot of that program.  My favorite part about his mother and how she would punish him was missing!  I was so very disappointed!!  I would not have purchased this video knowing what all is missing from the original.",1198886400,26,292,4.37037037037037
2644167,5,B000HWZ4UW,"I know it is edited, but this is Sinbad's second best standup show of all time.  His best was the one in Atlanta, Georgia, titled ""Brain Damaged.""

Sinbad's greatest standup performances:
Brain Damaged *****
Son of a Preacher Man *****
Afros and Bellbottoms ****
Nothin' But the Funk ***

Sinbad's best movies:
Houseguest *****
First Kid *****
Necessary Roughness ****
Jingle All the Way ***",1196121600,2,391,4.984615384615385
2644168,2,B000HWZ4UW,"I bought this one on Amazon along with Sinbad's Afros and Bell Bottoms DVD.

Having just calmed down after laughing hysterically throughout that DVD, I fired up Son of a Preacher Man and was very disappointed.

The material seemed good but maybe Sinbad's delivery was off. Or maybe because the crowd was not connecting. Or maybe it was the terrible editing.

It was because of these factors that I could not really get into this DVD.

I recommend to rent or borrow this DVD only.",1191456000,5,479,4.6

Sinbad is a great comedian and I'm glad they finally release more of his stand-up. Unfortunately, just like in the HBO special there are blank spaces for the commercial breaks and there seems to be a gap in routine, as though some of the routine was cut out. It only runs about 35 minutes (when you don't count the credits and opening producer advertising) so it's relatively short. I would advise you to rent it before you spend $15 with shipping an handling.",1191196800,17,634,5.9021739130434785
2644170,4,B000HWZ4UW,"Sinbad is a very visual performer, and he doesn't disappoint here.  Not quite as funny as the hilarious ""Afros & Bellbottoms"", but still a good laugh.",1187568000,3,150,4.769230769230769
2644171,2,B000HWZ4UW,"I remember seeing this comedy special when it first aired in 1996 and I absolutely loved it.  I was even more excited when I saw that it was coming out on DVD because my VHS copy broke.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed when I bought the DVD.  There are at least 30 minutes of Sinbad's performance that are edited out.  I knew something was wrong when the screen would fade to black for a second and then cut back to the show.  I don't know why they do this, but it really ruins the DVD. I will never put this DVD in my player again because they cut out some of my favorite parts.  I probably shouldn't complain because the price is so low, but I would rather pay more and have the whole show.",1185321600,48,699,4.140740740740741

8141750,2,B000HWZ4UW,I saw this when I was a kid and loved it. So I bought it. When I got it back it was missing joke??? I don't know why. I wish it would have said something about that. I was very disappointed that it was not the whole show.,1492128000,,221,3.625
