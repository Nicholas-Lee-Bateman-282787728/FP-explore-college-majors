8441127,5,B004U0CV9O,"Army Wives is a real series about real situations and people without being overly done.  The characters are all a good fit and the married couples are so believable; an excellent job of casting for sure.  I find myself laughing, crying, smiling and being sad all in the space of one episode; always hate to have the episode end and when I received these, I took the entire weekend and watched nearly all four seasons one episode after another.  Buy these!!!",1348531200,,457,4.617283950617284
8441128,5,B004U0CV9O,"I did not expect to enjoy this ""Military"" series as much as I did.  I said Catherine Bell again after ""JAG"" could not be good.  Well I was wrong she is good as an army nurse married to a major then colonel, and the rest of the cast Kim Delaney as the general's wife and the owner of the bar Roxy were specially good as was the psychiatrist. Very enjoyable--worth watching.",1331424000,2,372,4.225352112676056
