1923840,5,B0000DC3TN,"The New Forest Tai Chi for Beginners Video is a great stress relief tool, and who couldn't use that?  As a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) I see many people who are searching for tools to help them manage the stress in their lives and to help them achieve some sense of internal balance.  This video provides excellent training in using movement to achieve those goals.  Bright-Fey's approach is easy to learn and easily fits into even the busiest schedule.  No prior experience is necessary - this video is appropriate for all ages and all levels of physical ability. I highly recommend it!",1069804800,8,597,4.823529411764706
1923841,5,B0000DC3TN,"Having been a perpetual novice in the Chinese martial arts, and understanding the basics of T'ai Chi, I was very interested in the approach taken by John Bright-Fey in this video instruction.  By breaking down individual movements and incorporating his own simplified cognitive elements, Bright-Fey has developed a system that introduces much of the feel of T'ai Chi, and in a way that is understandable to virtually anyone.  I cannot see how this type of exercise would not be beneficial to anyone who is interested in developing better balance and flexibility.  For the student who would like an introduction to T'ai Chi, this is a fantastic resource.",1069027200,9,653,5.08411214953271
1923842,5,B0000DC3TN,"This is an excellent video for anyone needing to take that initial step toward improving their muscle conditioning and flexibility. The repetitive sequences with minimal gradations of complexity are well designed and very easy to follow. There is appropriate attention given to make the movement sequences quite feasible even for individuals with significantly impaired joint function or muscle pain/stiffness. As such, I would recommend this highly even for individuals in need of rehabilitation due to an arthritic or other musculoskeletal condition. The movement sequences should be of particular benefit for individuals with fibromyalgia syndrome finding it difficult to embark upon the exercise routines needed to improve their health.",1067385600,6,740,5.861111111111111
1923843,5,B0000DC3TN,"The New Forest T'ai Chi video for beginners is an excellent way to experience the benefits of a well-designed program of exercise which relieves stress, loosens joints and improves balance.
After taking two (one twelve week and one eight week) sessions with John and Kim Bright-Fey, I realized the video would encourage me to continue an exercise regimen at home.  I have been so pleased with the video because it accurately reflects their teachings and techniques and motivates me to do the exercises and routines in between the personal sessions. The routines are easy to learn and fun to do!! By the way, I am a 72-year-old female with a precious husband who has Parkinson's.  Talk about stress!!",1066521600,24,699,4.915254237288136
1923844,5,B0000DC3TN,"I am over 50, suffer from vertigo, and find this DVD to be very helpful.  This routine is very easy, and so I can do it whenever I have a few minutes. Also the book A Morning Cup of T'ai Chi has even more info about New Forest Tai Chi, and that is very helpful in my t'ai chi playing. When I use the imagery from the book it makes my tai chi play-time very relaxing and invigorating. I have played some more traditional forms of tai chi, and this DVD and book combination make it very easy to feel like I have done traditional practice. If you can get both book and DVD, do ! Using New Forest every day allows me to track my balance from one day to the next. I sure don't want to tump over and fall or break a hip. New Forest is a great tool to use on my balance.",1110758400,7,763,3.859872611464968
1923845,3,B0000DC3TN,"The instructions on this DVD are really easy to follow and learn. After one run through following along I can do this without ever watching the DVD again. I've never done anything like this before so I learned it all for the first time with this DVD. I like the fact that I learned it quickly because I usually get frustrated quickly and quit, but it left me wanting more. Like, is that all there is? I'm now on a quest for other Tai Chi DVD's that are equally as easy to learn but not leaving me wanting more.",1108252800,11,510,4.161616161616162
1923846,5,B0000DC3TN,"I just purchased this dvd and being a senior as well as a beginer I must say it gave me a whole new outlook on Tai Chi. I had tried it once before and found it complicated,but this tape is easy instructional and FUN. The instructor is easy to understand very pleasant to listen to,and a very good instructor. some may say this isn't Tia Chi but to them I say for those of us that are older and or beginers it offers a beautiful way to start into the wonderful world of Tai Chi. Thanks whole heartedly to its developer. I will continue to use this dvd and probably move up as I can all because someone finally made it a pleasure to understand. AAAA++++++",1106956800,14,653,4.190476190476191
1923847,5,B0000DC3TN,"New Forest Tai Chi for Beginners is just that - for beginners! I read the product description and several of the reviews. This product was obviously designed to bring the health benefits of tai chi to the average person. It is not traditional tai chi but it never claims to be!

Traditional tai chi can be difficult to learn. I know because I teach it! Students drop out all the time because they get frustrated trying to coordinate their arms and legs, while trying to move slowly. They could get it- if they stuck with it, but most don't. They were told tai chi would help them relax, but instead it stresses them out!

I recommend this video to all students who come to me looking for the health benefits of Tai chi. I have heard nothing but praise from those that have tried it. They all say pretty much the same thing ""I can do it!"".

If you're not sure this video is for you, take a moment to read the product description and the review written by Rebecca- I think she says it best. My opinion is that whether you are 35, 50 or 80 years old, if you want the health benefits of Tai chi- this tape is a gem!",1106524800,17,1111,4.206572769953052
1923848,1,B0000DC3TN,"I wanted to get into T'ai Chi, so my girl friend bought me this video for my birthday (bless her heart).  I tried watching the video, but turned it off after five minutes.  Why?  I found the instructor to not only annoying, but condescending as well.  It was like he was teaching a group of six year olds.  The annoying part was that his presentation style resembled an aerobics class more than a dojo.  If it were possible, I would give this video a neagative one star.",1106265600,7,470,4.344827586206897
1923849,2,B0000DC3TN,"Most Tai Chi videos are pretty bad.  Either the moves are too intricate, the pace is too fast or the camera is in the wrong place for the spatially challenged. I have owned several and most ended up in the trash.

New Forest Tai Chi breaks new ground - it is just plain silly.  Essentially, you paint the numbers 1 through 10 in the air with your hands.  There!  You just learned Tai Chi - Finger Paint Style.

But in truth, this might be good for someone with limited mobility and who could care less about ""grasping the bird's tail"".  Still, its a little pricey.

My recommendation is a VHS tape called Discovering Chi by Linda Modaro.  I wish they would re-release this in a DVD format.  In my opinion, this is the only one worth owning.",1105660800,9,740,4.335766423357664
1923850,1,B0000DC3TN,"After seeing such rave reviews and an overall 4.5 stars, I decided to buy this DVD.  What a complete waste of money.

1. The DVD was obviously made from a poor quality VHS version

2. The instructor was annoying, knew nothing about Tai Chi, and he did all of his Tai Chi showing you his back (there was no mirror in front of him, so you just had to guess what he was doing)

3. There is no music at all

4. There was no Tai Chi done at all! A Tai Chi routine does not consist of drawing 1-10 in the air over and over again.  His ""40 minute tai chi workout"" was not a work out, not tai chi, and not even 40 minutes (more like 5 minutes repeated 8 times!)",1105401600,9,653,3.8721804511278197
1923851,4,B0000DC3TN,"""New Forest T'ai Chi"" by John Bright-Fey is not only fun, but easy to follow. Many T'ai Chi videos or DVDs can be confusing. From the first time I watched this DVD, I was able to pick up the easy movements he teaches. I liked it because it allowed the student to be innovative and free in devising his/her own movement in some areas.

Following John Bright-Fey's movements seemed so natural and enjoyable. Knowing that this was so beneficial to my physical and emotional health was an added bonus. T'ai Chi has been shown to lower blood pressure, stimulate the immune system, improve balance and build stength, flexibility and coordination...all while having a good time and expressing yourself in various movements. He speaks in a very calm and soothing voice, and instructs at a pace the student can keep up with. After a few viewings, one can easily do the movements without the instructions. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to begin T'ai Chi to maintain flexibility, balance, and improve physical and emotional well-being.",1104105600,2,1042,4.887005649717514
1923852,5,B0000DC3TN,"John Bright-Fey is a natural teacher who takes simplicity to new levels of brilliance. When you learn other styles of T'ai Chi, you have to be so concerned about each movement and you can almost feel your inner perfectionist becoming frustrated.

With New Forest T'ai Chi, you are freed from perfectionism and finally you can express your creativity and personalize the flowing sequence of healing motion. To me, learning New Forest T'ai Chi was like learning how to paint imaginary calligraphy with my hands.

Not only is this form of T'ai Chi easy to remember, it heats the body, gives you an excellent workout and calms the nervous system. You also don't have to buy any special equipment. Some of the benefits I noticed almost immediately was more flexibility. The warm-up section was fun and playful and allowed you to move into the sequence of movements with more confidence.

Because of the way you are moving through the exercises you will develop excellent balance. While there are a few special instructions for exercise modifications, this is truly as easy as walking. In fact, you are moving at a slower pace than any exercise you have ever done before so you may consider this to be a very low impact routine.

Grandmaster John Bright-Fey takes you through a series of progressively more challenging exercises. At first you are stepping forwards and back and only drawing numbers with your hands and then he teaches you how to place your feet (heel first/toe first) and how to wave like wind and water. Finally, you put all you have learned into one routine and then you can take this routine anywhere you want to exercise.

I'd like to say this was ""one, two, three"" T'ai Chi. However, I think it is much more like calligraphy in motion. You paint numbers with your hands and this makes the movements super easy to remember. Highly recommended for all ages. This gets you moving and it is truly a fun routine that you will never forget. The spiritual elements come from your own experience while doing the exercises and your peace of mind will last long after the routine has been completed. I felt happier, as if I had let my creative child out to play.

A book to look for to enhance your workout experience: ""A Morning Cup of T'ai Chi"" by John A. Bright-Fey. An audio CD is included and each exercise is shown in detailed pictures. John Bright-Fey also covers topics like breathing, traditional Chinese medicine and has even translated four chapters from The Tao Te Ching. After reading the book, your workout will have a new depth of creativity.

In addition, she says she feels more energized and more limber. Thanks for providing such an easy to follow routine...and such a fun one as well!",1100217600,4,258,4.886363636363637
1923854,5,B0000DC3TN,"An 84 year old friend of mine recommended this video because she said she could do it and it has helped her balance. I agree. It was very easy to follow. The other videos I have tried were too complicated for me. I tried a class at the Y but I could not keep up. Other people don't like this video because it is too easy but it is perfect for me. John Bright-Fey is a very friendly instructor and I can understand him! His book, A Morning Cup of Tai Chi, gives additional instructions which I find very beneficial. I highly recommend both products!",1099526400,11,548,4.228571428571429

1923856,1,B0000DC3TN,"This was a complete waste of money.  The routine was simplistic and repetitive.  This wasn't a work-out.  There was no spirituality to the session.  Whatever it was, it wasn't Tai Chi.",1097107200,8,184,4.838709677419355
1923857,5,B0000DC3TN,"John Bright-Fey has definitely presented a program that is easy to follow, simple to remember, and allows for personal interpretation.  His gentle method of instruction pulls the participant into an environment of safe, relaxing fun.  Complicated mirror imaging is eliminated by Bright-Fey keeping his back to the camera during each segment.  One of the goals of this program, stated in the introduction, is for ""players"" to be able to practice the discipline without dependance on the video.  After one run through you realize the goal is attainable.  The reflective statements at the end of the session give positive feedback that inspires you to try it again.

After purchasing several Tai Chi books and DVD's that left me confused and accomplished nothing, this video was a surpise and a delight!  I would highly recommend New Forest Tai Chi for Beginners.",1092700800,39,860,5.143884892086331
1923858,1,B0000DC3TN,"I bought this video based on the glowing reviews, and was extremely disappointed. While it undoubtedly has some exercise value for impatient westerners, this quick and dirty ""T'ai Chi"" resembles the classic form in the same way air guitar resembles Segovia.

 Basically, the method consists of three steps forward, one to the side -- three step backwards, one to the side, while tracing the numbers 1 to 10 in the air. Add to this some ""wind and water"" (sway), and some straddle-the-railroad-tracks posture and you have this method in a nutshell.

 I suggest this use of the tape: seize the tape box, take one step forward, sway, trace a large zero in the air, and drop it in the trash.",1091318400,20,686,4.691666666666666
1923859,5,B0000DC3TN,"Like many people, I have tried all kinds of yoga only to discover that pain and soreness outweigh any ""relaxing"" benefits.  Then I discovered New Forest Tai Chi.  This video provides what I've been looking for for years--a simple movement routine that relaxes and boosts energy without tying me up in knots.  Far from the manic energy I'd feel sometimes from aerobics (ugh) or power yoga, playing New Forest Tai Chi makes me feel truly relaxed and revitalized for the rest of the day.  I was surprised at first because the videotape seems so simple. I'm usually wary of anything for beginners, but the introductory level of the video makes it completely accessible and yet I can tell the benefits are quite advanced.",1082678400,14,716,4.796747967479675
1923860,5,B0000DC3TN,"Having played a variety of styles of tai chi with a variety of teachers, I have to say that John Bright-Fey's presentation of tai chi makes this powerful art accessible to anyone and everyone.

The way the moves are broken down into steps and stages helps you to really comprehend not just the movements but the parts of your body that you are using. I find myself looking forward to my New Forest time and even do a short run through at my desk during the day to keep me focused and centered.  My goal is to perfect my moves and to focus on my breathing and my balance so I never get bored which is an accomplishment in itself as I usualy don't have a lot of patience.

Participants are asked to draw numbers in the air, sometimes adding a wavylegged motion or two; even as a beginner, I think I know that this is nowhere near authentic Tai Chi. It has all the depth of a two o'clock in the morning infomercial, and will require about as much of your attention--I did, however, wake up at one point where Bright-Fey holds up a cardboard Yin-Yang diagram and attempts to expain what it means.
