8257417,4,B001543LL0,"With lush settings and disciplined choruses, this live-action performance of LOHENGRIN is the one to see if you're only gonna see this opera once.  It features three outstanding performances: first and formost is Gabriele Schnaut's terrifying portrayal of Ortrud.  Watching this is like being attacked by a moulting ostrich.  Ekkehard Wlashiha makes excellent use of his snarling, penetrating top as Telramund, and Eike-Wilm Schulte's bright, creamy high-baritone serves him well as the Heerrufer, which is a much more difficult role than is generally appreciated.

Manfred Schenk (the King), Paul Frey (title character) and Cheryl Studer (Elsa) deliver workmanlike performances, not spectacular.",1264032000,,696,5.861386138613861
8257418,5,B001543LL0,"Not only a swan but the river Elbe - the first scene of the second act takes place at the shore of the river - real water, real waves - a full moon that rises from the water into the sky as the scene unfolds. The whole production is very romantic. Act 1 takes place in Winter on the frozen river. Act 2 moves to Spring. After the scene at the river the procession to the cloister moves through Friedrich inspired ruined gothic arches. Act 3 moves to Summer - a bed with a huge swan situated in a stonehenge-like setting complete with shooting stars. And the final scene returns to Winter. And it is matched by great singing and acting. No weak links here. But best is the Bayreuth chorus - is there any better? And the chorus is a major character in this opera. It makes one sad that Wagner turned against the chorus after Lohengrin.",1208476800,,833,4.2784810126582276
