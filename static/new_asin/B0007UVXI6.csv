2245011,4,B0007UVXI6,"I remember the entire race to the moon. I was convinced we had landed on the moon until a couple weeks ago when I saw the moon images for myself on the Navy's own Clementine satellite images stored on their own website for public display.

Having been an  executive level engineer for 30 years, it was a shock to find out the truth for myself. While videos, documentaries and websites can always twist information.... take a look directly at the moon itself. I highly recommend going onto the Navy's own website and take a look at their moon satellite images, particularly around the extreme lunar north and south poles. There are mining operations, buildings, craft.. you name it and they are not ours. Some of the mining pits are a couple hundred miles across and you can see the mining in process. In some cases the Navy attempted to smudge out the large buildings but you can still see some of it. Others, they completely missed. Don't take my word for it. Look for yourself. Use the regional images on the Clementine lunar browser, copy the  images as a bmp format and blow them up 2x to 3x with a photo editor. Don't bother with the close up images on the Navy's site because they have deleted these files or substituted. However, you can still see the objects or interest in the area photos. (highest resolution)

After reading Phil Corso's book ""The Day After Roswell"" where he described Nasa's of alien bases on the moon during their first orbit to take photos, I found the Navy's satellite image website to check the lunar area's Corso described. He was absolutely correct. They are located right where he said.. and then some.

Don't take anyone's word for it. Look for yourself. It will take a few hours of scanning images for you to adjust your eyes to discerning particular objects in the rough terrain.

Don't bother with the images on Nasa's website. They did massive editing of the photos.",1158364800,23,1906,4.640949554896142
2245012,1,B0007UVXI6,"I received a copy of ""What Happened on the Moon"" directly from the producers as I gave David Percy and his assistant a tour of the Goldstone tracking facility and was interviewed on camera by David in December of 1997.

I worked at the Goldstone Manned Space Flight Network station during all Apollo missions and was an eyewitness to those historic events. However, this DVD is filled with half-truths and total fabrications about the Apollo program. It will only be of interest to people who like things about ""Area 51,"" ""Crop Circles,"" Roswell ""UFO's"" and other weird ""happenings.""

Anyone who has even the slightest knowledge of photography and physics can see through the so-called ""facts"" presented in this fabrication. It should be considered a work of fiction instead of an independent view of a historic achievement.

2245013,4,B0007UVXI6,"Let's move beyond the rolling Coke bottle B.S., shall we?  There are just far, far, too many anomalies uncovered by a variety of researchers to dismiss the fact that the Apollo missions were not what they seemed.  Hey, I loved NASA and the whole gang when I was a kid, so reading and seeing things over the years that pointed toward fraud and deception really stung, but I got beyond the rage and the shock.  The Van Allen Belts, all the dubious photos exhibiting a variety of issues, the total lack of film fogging, strange comments and actions from many ""sponsors"" such as Kodak and Omega, the rehearsed videos meant to deceive, the truly bizarre behaviour of the astronauts in subsequent interviews, and on and on.  Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water here.  The Coke bottle and the ""flag waving issue"" aside, there is a massive deception going on and this video sheds some light on it.  Fair enough.  Now let's have some intelligent discussion on it.",1150416000,29,967,4.619883040935672
2245014,1,B0007UVXI6,"This film is awful.  I could only stomach the first 45 minutes of this 2 hour epic.  The same information is available in much greater detail on the internet for free, and you get the availability of hearing both sides of the issue.

Not only is the film boring and ridiculously cheesy, but the arguments are weak.  At one point, David Percy shows a video from Apollo 16 showing the jump salute.  His argument is that a flap hanging loose from the PLSS backpack is visible in the still photos of the event but not in the video.  It would be a good argument if the flap wasn't plainly visible in the video.  They show the video multiple times and the flap is clearly flopping around during the jump.  If you didn't catch it the first time, they give you another chance.

At another point, they reference the ""anomalous"" shadow directions in the lunar photographs by showing a photograph of a row of trees and their ""correctly aligned"" shadows.  Big honking white lines are drawn on top of the picture to show the shadow angle.  Too bad one of the trees directly to the right of the big honking line has a shadow that appears horizontal in comparison to the line and the rest of the shadows.  They used a picture showing diverging shadow angles to try and prove that shadow angles do not diverge under a single light source.

Finally (at least to the point that I could handle watching), they show the famous photo of Buzz Aldrin standing next to the leg of the LM.  They claim that the center fiducial is significantly below the center of the frame.  They also claim that they are using high quality duplicates from the original master prints.  They are as bold as to say that the photo must have been manipulated in nefarious ways.  They are correct. The photo has been manipulated but it wasn't by NASA.  People epxerienced with the Apollo record know that the top of Buzz's PLSS backpack is cut off by the top of the frame in that famous shot, but in their copy they place the top of the frame well above the backpack and to compensate they cut off a similar amount at the bottom to keep the dimensions correct.  Percy and his crew either deliberately recropped the photograph themselves or are lying about their source of the photo.

When the makers of this film aren't unintentionally showing us the mistakes in their arguments they are creating the anomalies themselves.  They are hacks and this film is the proof.",1145923200,54,2419,4.527649769585254

There are too many conflicting facts in the so-called Moon event not to think, observe and pause.  One thing for sure.  Money went to NASA.  And they are trying it again in the next 15 years.  Money flows again!

No, I do not believe we went to the moon and came back perfectly 5 times....or how many there were.  No, I do not belive Building 7 just happened to be prepared to implode the same day as the big one.  No, I do not believe LHO killed JKF.  Why?

2245024,1,B0007UVXI6,"I almost wish I had the urge to shred this into all the tiny pieces I could do, but really don't see the need.  A few salient points are all that anyone should need.

Main thing is that this shares one very important feature with most conspiracy theories.  In almost 50 years, not a single person has stepped forward to say they were part of the plot.  No actors, no set crew person, no editors, no one has said 'yes, I helped make these films and photos.'  Of course, as is also common with these crackpots is the theme that people die mysterious deaths or must be threatened with death or worse.  Because we all know that once you spoke up to just about any media outlet in the free world with this information no way are they going to see that you are safer than the President at least until they have the full story.  Everyone knows those NASA death squads are the best at what they do in the world if not the universe.  Those pocket protectors are deadly.

Second thing that totally bugged me was when the woman said ""dark side"" of the moon.  she quickly corrected herself, but what got me was that she said it at all.  I am being led to believe she is a scholar, author and perhaps a scientist yet she uses a term that even laymen with half a brain learned was patently incorrect long ago.  When the NASA representative says ""expedition"" then corrects himself to ""expeditions"" that is a smoking gun which they spent a little time making note of.  I don't know if the questions being asked were all in the context of the whole program or if there were any that related to a specific mission so his correction isn't an issue for me.  Her use of ""dark side"" speaks volumes about her actual likely qualifications though.

Lighting, lighting, lighting.  This goes back somewhat to the above as well.  At no point did I hear or see anything addressing Earthshine.  I hope everyone realizes that except for very rare instances the Earth reflects a lot more sunlight than the moon does. Every gone for a moonlit stroll?  Multiply that light several times if the Earth happened to be under a thick cloud cover.  Ever see the moon early in the morning just after sunrise when it is also on the Eastern horizon?  I am not absolutely positive of this but I believe one of the reasons A 13 was scheduled to land beyond the terminator was to try doing so with Earthshine mostly.
Oh, and I wonder what effect lighting from the Earth would have on photos being made?  Apparently that was not a consideration for these folks.

Radiation?  Really?  Do these people know anything about radiation and especially radiation outside the atmosphere?  Apparently not because it seems they believe the radiation from test explosions several years before was still up there.  I have read that it had largely dissipated within 5 years or less.  A funny characteristic of radiation is that it doesn't just float around waiting for something to do.  Unlike me it is actually bouncing around trying to be somewhere else.  If I recall my basic physics correctly gamma particles are both the most dangerous and most active.  The danger comes largely from the activity.  Radiation....radio.....ACTIVE.  So guess which particles are going to try hardest to be somewhere else soonest?  But, why apply basic physics when that contradicts the boogey man coming for you?

Last thing was the feather test.  Even if they had me believing, that bit of fakery sealed the deal against them.  The reason I say that is because when I was much younger, a buddy and I did likely the same thing they did just to mess with our high school science teacher.  See you take a feather, spray it down with a clear varnish or lacquer, I understand you can also coat it in wax for the same result.  Maybe inject some liquid in the air spaces just to increase the weight a little more.  Dropped that bad boy a good 8 feet and it fell like a rock.  Which it pretty much was at that point.  Took some slight of hand to keep it out of the teacher's grasp but the next day he repeated what we had done.  Over night he realized what we must have done so he did the same.  The thing is he pointed out the main thing that alerted him something was very wrong.
Except for maybe cats, ANYTHING dropped from a sufficient height will interact with an atmosphere in some noticeable way.  Ever notice war footage of bombs being dropped?  The first moments they fall pretty straight and true, then they start to wobble unless they have fins or something to help guide the air flow over them.  It has everything to do with surface resistance to the airflow.  Unless it is an absolutely perfect sphere, even a marble would begin to spin if dropped from high enough.  Maybe even then.  The purpose of that experiment was not to prove that weight mattered so much as to prove that airflow over an object's surface was the only thing that would cause an adjustment to gravity's pull.
I said that all wrong really, but still better than they did.  Gravity is a constant.  It has nothing to do with weight when it comes to bringing a body downward.  Atmospheric resistance might cause a slowing effect.  Simple as that.  (Purposely avoided terminal velocity because my point was to illustrate their lack of scientific evidence only.)

I could go on and on and on but the bottom line for me is that they did nothing to claim the burden of proof that we had not sent men to the moon and returned them safely.  Offering a few Hollywood (et al) movies in any context is not going to help your case either.  Trying to make a case based on the astronauts playing a couple of very popular songs from the period that happened to contribute to the naming of the units also says nothing tangible.  Telling me Werner Von Braun wanted to build rockets and put men in space and was pretty heartless about just how he did that is merely stating old news.
Maybe most telling over all for me though was the spotlight on Neil Armstrong.  If you look up reluctant hero, Armstrong is the face you will find in the dictionary.  Or should be.  He considered himself a normal man doing a normal job and did not care for any hoopla attached to that.  Believe it or not, there are modest people in this world.  Ever notice that firemen run into a fire while normal people fun away?  Few do it for bragging rights either.  Some people simply see a job that needs done and go do it.  Just because the people that made this travesty don't understand that mindset does not give them the right to cast aspersions toward Mr. Armstrong or what he accomplished.....as quietly as he was allowed.",1494201600,6,6588,4.48989898989899

2245029,1,B0007UVXI6,"This ""movie"" is atrocious and horrible. My rating is for the movie and not for the content. See content comments below if you are interested.
As for the film, it is filled with extra nonsense, grossly over timed monologues, repeat chatter and comments as well as useless filler. You could fit all this in an hour an a half.
The quality is barely better than a 1987 camcorder and the audio is horrible.
The creators and those involved make little effort to back up their assertions with understandable science and rely completely on opinion and speculation with the exception of minute amounts of grainy and inconclusive ""evidence"".
Lastly, the term documentary is used loosely here. There is no mention of counter evidence or opinion. There is no structure worthy of documenting anything and it frankly just sucks. I can assure you, if you are interested in wasting time learning about the pitifully ignorant people who believe in such conspiracy theories, there are much better quality ones on YouTube.

As for the content.
So a guy at a terrible CGI ""news desk"" in a hideous tie can discredit what men who spent their entire lives dedicated to, simply by finding some people to put in his ""film"" that agree to say they don't think it was true. You and I and everyone else should demand a hell of a lot of undeniable or at least scientifically measured proof before someone can just pop up with a video and discredit someone and everyone believes them. Demand more from someone who has the intention of drawing negative attention to someone, The men who were in the Apollo program were brave and groundbreaking pilots, engineers and scientists.

Let me help you out with the notion that we could not have been capable of that based on lack of science and tech. We had a jet that could fly at 80,000 feet in the sky, at nearly 3000 mph and take detailed photographs of a wristwatch, navigating by the precise position of the starts at any given moment during that same decade and time period, but you claim the technology we had was not efficient? It was primitive to today's standards but not for that period in time. The factor that made it different was the incredible minds of those using it. I heard someone back up this notion of inadequate technology by suggestion that we had AM radios in our car back then so this technology was not able to get us to the moon. My cell phone can do at least 20 things I needed separate devices for just about 15 years ago and has far more computing power. So what.
Modern machine guns are far more effective than Attila the Hun and his men with spears. The Egyptians had no hydraulic cranes and vehicles that we know of. They still accomplished quite a bit for their time if I am not mistaken. The engineers and mathematicians then (some of them un-credited African American Women fyi) used slide rules and equations to tell astronauts what to enter into that technology. People are smart and were then.

You attempt to convince people on the thinnest shred of a grainy piece of ""evidence"" that something was somehow hoaxed or staged? Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Only one side has that here and it isn't the conspiracy side.
You have multiple people including the host not only offering very little scientifically substantial proof but yet just saying something is fake or their analysis must be true, and expect people to believe it. (Don't forget the age old trick of subliminally notating the words ""intelligent thinking people all agree"" as if to persuade those who will believe them they will be somehow on the side of those more intelligent.) Compare that to the actual evidence supporting the moon landing. The scale isn't even and we all know it. There is a huge amount of actual indisputable evidence supporting the Apollo landing.

Here is a good rule of thumb when deciding whether a conspiracy is really true or not. If its called a conspiracy theory, that is because it has thin margins of proof to support it.
If you can't use the scientific method to provide evidence that supports your alternate hypothesis, then go away and come back when you do.

And most importantly, decide which is more likely or which would take more of a miracle and begin there with your scrutiny.
Is it more likely that:
-The most gifted and intelligent men and women in our country, all trained specifically for a particular area of expertise, were funded by one of the wealthiest governments on the planet at that time to develop a moon landing mission,
- Said men and women devoted their career to those projects using actual science, engineering and experimentation to develop ways to travel to the moon, test them repeatedly, and then conclude it was possible.
- Acquire the most talented test pilots and flight experience on the planet and train them for years to understand and command said undertaking, with complete support from the aforementioned experts in science and government.
- Send them to the moon with photographic and video proof, live in front of the entire world with complete ability to stand on a beach and watch the rocket take off.
- Everyone has free and complete access to images, video, radio communications, satellite images of the moon landing sites, etc., without regard to keeping any secret (not quantifying technological secrets, etc. I may not be aware of).
- Those original innovations and experiences have since helped us put robots on a planet a quarter of a billion miles away, armed with lasers and scientific equipment that we can control with the touch of a button.
- Those astronauts kept that secret to the grave, never telling anyone else or writing it anywhere, and never having told someone or written it anywhere to be discovered posthumously.

Or is it more likely to you that:
- A closely guarded few people developed tangible rockets, launch pads, space travel missions all as a preemptive set-up to an upcoming scam with no intention of using them and even caused people to be killed in testing and projects leading up to the scam.
- Those same people with the backing of the huge federal government and apparently only a few select individuals maintained knowledge of this attempt to fool everyone but no one shared the secret, outsiders never asked questions, and nothing ever ever leaked in 60 years time.
- Fake photos and movies totaling in the thousands of hours of footage and photos we are made and developed and a team of people, however small or large all worked diligently to make them the best fakes (still to this day) ever made.
- All those involved maintained complete silence since the hoax and not one person has ever produced any evidence of ANY tangible proof that someone set all of this up and this theory of hoax can be completely proven. Not one single definitive item of proof can discredit this.
- Those same people did it so flawlessly that they fooled almost everyone on the entire planet Earth, with the noticeable exception of the fringe few that believe this nonsense and the guy in this video that doesn't even understand what an ugly tie is, happens to be smarter than almost everyone else on the planet and has it all figured out.
- As of 2017, where we have the technology to do surgery on people hands free, transform images, build things, control the worlds economy - No one can find any way to prove any of the hoax hypothesis beyond speculation and opinion after almost 50 years.

Film also shows us the means - once in low earth orbit who really knows what's going on out there and the signals could have any source and be bounced of a relay or set of relays. 1/2 speed film + guide wires are fun!

2245058,5,B0007UVXI6,"I'll say it right off the top, yes, this is a slow-paced presentation but it is slow-paced because it is thorough and goes into the finest detail to explain why these ""anomalies"" are important. For the average viewer who knows little about photography or especially the photography as it pertains to the difficult methods used to take photographs on the moon, these explainations are very important and are key to understanding why the angles and such on many famous photographs simply cannot be taken how they were said to have been taken. A chest-mounted camera without access to any kind of view-finder or focus mechanism makes the photographs examined obvious fakes -- or rather, genuine ""fakes"" in that they were of an astronaut on a soundstage but not of an astronaut on the moon.

All of the time spent explaining all the various aspects of why the Apollo missions are dubious is important and if you dismiss the film because it's simply too boring and slow-paced you really don't have an argument saying the presenters don't prove their point or that it's silly to even think this. It's not the pace of the explaination, it's the quality of the explaination and this is the most thorough explaination of the subject available.

Take an afternoon and do yourself a favor. Open your mind and truly let this examination sink in. Rewind and replay parts so you really understand what is being presented. You'll see things as they are.

The simple fact of a photograph being taken with the sun directly behind your subject and still getting a clear image of the subject's side facing the camera is something you can ""prove"" in your own backyard. Go out and take a photo of a friend or family member with the sun over their shoulder as is shown in one of the most famous photographs ever presented of a ""man on the moon"". Don't use flash just as the astronauts had no extra lighting source and see what kind of photo you get ... you know what kind you'll get just reading this; it will be a near if not a complete silouhette of your subject. It's no different on the moon. This alone should start you questioning how all of the amazing photography was accomplished ... not to mention the other obstacles that lay between man and the moon such as the severe level of radiation you must pass through just to get to the moon without Apollo using any apparent protection at all.

Don't simply dismiss this out of hand. Look at it seriously as the film-makers have and I think you'll say at the end that at the very least, some of this was faked ... and perhaps a great deal was faked. And as the film-makers say at several points, "" ... the images of NASA of a manned lunar landing are not the true and accurate record of such an event."" That is their ultimate point, their final statement on all of the information gathered and explained here. And that, my fellow American, in my humble opinion, is what they prove here in this film.

Also, this is a 3 hour and 45 minute presentation, not a 5.5 hour as another reviewer stated ... so it's not THAT painfully long ;) lol

(Also, by the way, the much shorter ""A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon"" which I have also watched along with its sequel, covers a good deal of the same information but it's ""exploitive"" in my opinion and a bit too sensational for me to recommend. Certainly, the fist-fights or near fist-fights its film-maker mostly instigates while ""interviewing"" astronauts as evidenced in his sequel, ""Astronauts Gone Wild"", I think says more about his efforts than his examination of the evidence. You can get anyone to take a swing at you if you work at it ... proving that the Apollo missions were at least partly faked is quite another thing and a serious matter in my opinion and should not be an exercise in taunting of interview subjects or even alleged outright stalking and harrassment which some of the subjects have stated in legal actions against the film-maker.)",1374969600,11,3944,4.587234042553192

2245061,5,B0007UVXI6,"I am an Armature Astronomer and have a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering so I was a little sceptical when I sat down to watch this documentary. I have seen other material debunking NASA Apollo missions to the Moon before, and I was not convinced then. However the evidence presented in this double DVD is of an entirely different order. After having watched all 4 hours (a bit of a challenge, as its quite a low budget DVD, and kind of reminded me of the Open University videos you used to get in the 80's on the BBC) I am now completely convinced that most of the Apollo Moon mission footage (video and photo's) was shot in a very large purpose built studio. I am AMAZED. Once you've seen these DVD's there is no going back, the photo's and video's which NASA say were taken at the same time, clearly are not. They're lying! It boggles the mind. Anyone taking the time to watch these DVD's I believe would have to come to the same conclusion.

Now whether most people can focus for 4 hours, watching this low budget, boring analytical delivery (albeit explosive material) is another question. But, if you can get past the boring delivery and pay attention to the content, this is mind blowing stuff.

There is a lot of content here; covering analysis of... video's, photo's, film studio production techniques, NASA statements, history of rocket development from the 1940's to now (very interesting), effects of solar radiation on human health and photographic film and Van Allen radiation belts.

2245064,5,B0007UVXI6,"This DVD is an accompaniment to the book Dark Moon: Apollo And The Whistle-Blowers by Mary Bennett & David S. Percy. The DVD is split into 3 main sections:
1. Deals with the demonstrably false lunar photography.
2. The dangers of space radiation and the lunacy of those who insist that space is a benign environment.
3. The evolution of the rockets involved and the problems encountered - and never solved - during research.

For anyone who doubts there are any major flaws to be found in 1., try this simple test. Go to the Apollo Image Atlas at h[...], select 70mm Hasselblad, Apollo 11, Magazine S, image number AS11-40-5930. At the bottom of the page click on the link to see the Hi Resolution Image(s), then save the image to your PC. Open the image in Windows in Paint Shop Pro or PhotoShop or similar, or open it in Linux with Gimp. Create a negative of the image, then zoom in to the rocks in the right and the left of the image. You will see indisputably, especially clearly in negative as the shadow shows up as stark white, that in the left of the image the shadows are on the right side of the rocks, and on the right side of the image the shadows are indisputably on the left of the rocks. In the foreground they go from south to north. Additionally, there is a very obvious ""hot spot"" around the astronaut shadow's head, which again can be more clearly seen in negative. This is indicative of multiple light sources, as in a studio set; if the sun is the only source of light then ALL shadows should run parallel and there should be no hotspots.

Another major flaw with the imagery is to be found in the very first magazine from Apollo 11. As you scroll down the images showing the earth getting ever further away, how strange then that the images between AS11-36-5382 & AS11-36-5399 all show bright BLUE light coming through the windows? This is only possible if the craft is in LEO. The list goes on. The DVD lists a large number of related anomalies which show beyond any doubt that the public record of the Apollo missions is not a true and accurate record of those missions.

For those who insist upon perpetrating the idiocy that, as far as radiation goes, space is a benign environment, the DVD also shows that this is sheer lunacy. Again this is laid out in far more detail in the book. NASA has consistently lied about the true state of the radiation belts, including the newly-created artificial belt, that encircle the planet since their own criminal folly in 1962 - exploding nuclear weapons into the belts to try to blast a passage through them during Operations Argus & Starfish Prime - and has even went to the lengths of revising the extent of the Van Allen belts (with no good reason given) to a THIRD of the size established by Dr. James Van Allen in order to minimise the perceived radiation exposure risk to the astronauts. That the Apollo astronauts displayed average daily radiation doserates lower than astronauts on low earth orbit Skylab missions is in and of itself proof that these astronauts did not go through the belts, and deep space, and walk on the moon (the surface of which itself is now thought to be highly radioactive! according to NASA itself), then return through deep space and the radioactive belts again.

The third part of the DVD looks at the development, or, more correctly, the lack of development, of the US rockets and documents the high-level collaboration between the supposedly implacable enemies via the ever-accommodating United Kingdom, often in the shape of Jodrell Bank.

The DVD does not go as far as the book. The central thesis of the book is that we DID go to the moon, just not as described. The DVD does not go into this in any detail, but in its own right it conclusively demonstrates that the public record of the Apollo missions is false. For anyone who insists it is some kind of heresy to make such a suggestion, please explain how it is possible to see shadows from opposite directions when there is supposed to be only one source of light, and also how is it possible to see blue light out of ALL the windows when allegedly halfway to the moon? If you cannot answer these things simply and logically then you need to watch the video.

For anyone who is interested, the book actually suggests, backed up by some very compelling evidence, that there WAS a manned lunar mission. But only one. The authors suggest this was a joint US-Soviet mission with a Soviet Soyuz providing the transport and returning to earth, and with the American astronaut essentially on a suicide mission in his one-man LEM. The Soviet cosmonaut who drove the Soyuz was supposed to be Pavel Ivanovich Belyayev. Note that this very link-up was announced publicly in the late 1960s and was to happen by 1975; the authors merely suggest it happened a few years earlier than the USA & Soviet Union publicly say it did.

A strange tale, that of Pavel Ivanovich Belyayev. According to Wikipedia, Belyayev was selected for the space programme in 1960 after nearly fifteen years' experience in the Soviet air force and navy. He was originally to fly the Vostok 8 mission into Earth's Van Allen radiation belt, but this was cancelled. He died in 1970 from peritonitis that resulted from an operation on a stomach ulcer and is buried in the Novodevichy convent in Moscow.

How strange it is then, when one looks at the grave of Pavel Ivanovich Belyayev, that this man who apparently did nothing at all out of the ordinary has the most splendid grave out of ALL of the cosmonauts in Moscow's most prestigious cemetery, with a magnificent statue evocative of someone who has done something truly special. Also strange is the fact that, contrary to custom he was not cremated but was buried with full honours. And for what exactly was Pavel Belyayev awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union, Order of Lenin, Order of the Red Star, numerous medals and foreign orders for? He also bore the title of the Hero of Socialist Labor of Bulgaria, Hero of Vietnam, and Hero of Mongolia, and had a minor planet, 2030 Belyaev discovered in 1969 by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh, named after him.

There appears to be no record of the US astronaut who in all probability died on the moon.

Just imagine if the USSR (Russia) had carried out the moon landing.

Imagine the dent in US national pride. Well if this film had then come along and accused the USSR of faking the landing.

The US support would have been in the majority - 'of course Russia did not land on the moon' everyone would have chorused.

The problem is that most people see such an historic event, an event that has come to be seen as 'man's' greatest achievement, through political filters.

No if Russia had done it, becuase we don't WANT them to have done,

or YES if the US did it, beacuse we'd WANT that.

8052034,5,B0007UVXI6,"The video What Happened On the Moon? An Investigation Into Apollo and the AULIS web site are excellent sources of information on the doubtful authenticity of the historical records presented to the public of the Apollo moon missions.  I first watched this video about ten years ago.  My father worked for NASA for 25 years, and after that I worked for them for 25 years.  When I started as a contractor in April of 1989 shortly before the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) of 1989 under the direction of the National Space Council (NSC) I was excited as a chemical engineer to be working on life support systems for future long duration missions, such as would be required for a manned mission to Mars, establishing a permanent base on the Moon, or the long duration mission of operating a manned space station.  I got to work on some very interesting and technically satisfying things at NASA.  I never needed to get a security clearance while at NASA, beyond whatever ordinary background check they do on employees.  When I started as a federal employee in 1990 I did have to take an oath of loyalty to the U.S. Constitution.

I started waking up to government and media lies about 9/11 in January 2004.  So I really started becoming a serious student of conspiracy theories at that point.  This is like opening Pandoras Box.  Eventually I felt compelled to look into the moon landing hoax.  I watched this video and also read a book with a lot of the same information by the same authors called Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle Blowers.  I watched Bart Sibrels videos, all four of them.  I read Bill Kaysings work and anything else I could find on the internet.  I concluded that most if not all of what was presented to the public documenting the moon landings had been faked.  Whether this means man has never set foot on the moon I do not know.  I would like to think that we have been there, but I doubt it.  The web site for this video (AULIS) has some recent articles that explain the tremendous problems NASA has been facing moving human space exploration forward, which suggests that man has likely never been beyond low earth orbit.  One such recent article posted there is The Apollo Myth: A Hindrance to Human Space Exploration by Phil Kouts PhD.  Also, posted on the AULIS web site for many years now is a quote from Dr. James Fetzer saying, Jack White's studies of anomalies in the Apollo space program raise the disturbing question, if man went to the Moon, then why was it necessary to fake so many photos? This parallels his earlier work on JFK, which raised a similar question about alleged assassin Lee Oswald, namely, if he really shot JFK, then why was it necessary to fake evidence to frame a guilty man?

I have been drawn back to this subject matter recently because there is a flat earth movement (The Great Flattening) gaining traction over the last 2 to 3 years which claims that the earth is flat according to a literal interpretation of Gods word the Bible, that there is no such thing as space and that NASA has been faking the entire space program (including the faked moon missions) since its inception, which is a significant part of Satans scientific deceptions that are hiding the truth of God from the human race.  The popular flat earther DVD Scientism Exposed which currently can be viewed for free on Youtube clearly presents this viewpoint.  What is going on here with this flat earth movement?  Is our modern civilization reaping what it has sown with all of its many lies over so long?  Have most people who have taken the red pill been vaccinated against accepting the many lies of the government and media which hide real conspiracies so that they are much less likely to fall for future lies?  But have some over reacted to the vaccine where they are identifying conspiracies and lies where they do not exist?  It is kind of like an auto immune disease.  Civilization is attacking and eating itself.  The baby is getting thrown out with the bath water by many.  I think it is fairly easy to show that the flat earth theory does not fit reality and I am continuing to do more work in this area, although many are far ahead of me in this regard.  Interestingly, there was a well developed and historically documented flat earth movement well over 100 years ago that was strikingly similar to what we have today.  And todays movement is relying heavily upon the writings from the old movement and voluminously expanding upon them.  It was a money making scheme for some then, and it appears to be a money making scheme for many today as well.  History is repeating itself.  A good book for this historical perspective is Flat Earth: The History of an Infamous Idea by Christine Garwood, which first came out in 2007 long before this recent resurrection of the flat earth movement.  (In my Amazon review of her book I also included a simple refutation of flat earth theory, soundly roundly flat earth debunked.)

So this is my take on NASA.  Yes I learned many years ago that NASA stands for Never A Straight Answer or Numerous Anomalies and Scams Allowed, and once I awoke to the Apollo mission fakery I ended up meeting some fellow NASA employees who had come to the same conclusion.  But this is what I think and hope is the case.  From my perspective, NASA has done a hell of a lot of research and work that has benefitted humanity in many ways.  Flat earthers are able to fly safely and efficiently to their conferences because of work NASA has done.  The vast majority of NASA employees are good dedicated people who do good honest work that is for the most part openly shared.  Any conspiracies of deception that NASA has been involved in have been orchestrated at the highest levels way beyond the pay grade of the vast majority of ordinary NASA employees like my father and I were.

But heres some history

Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) of 1989, from Wikipedia
On July 20, 1989, the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, George H. W. Bush  then President of the United States  announced plans for what came to be known as the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI).[1] In a speech on the steps of the National Air and Space Museum he described plans calling for constructing Space Station Freedom, sending humans back to the Moon ""to stay"" and ultimately sending astronauts to explore Mars. He proposed not a 10-year Apollo-style plan, but a long-range continuing commitment based on the three above elements, ending with a journey into tomorrow  a journey to another planet  a manned mission to Mars. The President noted it was humanitys destiny to explore, and Americas destiny to lead. He asked Vice President Dan Quayle to lead the National Space Council in determining what was needed to carry out these missions in terms of money, manpower and technology.

And 28 years later (two days ago)
From space.com October 5, 2017
First meeting of the newly reinstated National Space Council (NSC)
""We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but [also] to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond,"" Pence said today (Oct 5) at the first meeting of the newly reinstated National Space Council (NSC).  ""The moon will be a stepping stone, a training ground, a venue to strengthen our commercial and international partnerships as we refocus America's space program toward human space exploration,"" Pence added.

Is it any wonder we have people claiming that the earth is flat and that NASA is a complete fake and joke?

NASA, lets admit weve not yet been there, and then do what is necessary to go there for the first time.  Not as Vice President Pence said two days ago, which maintains the deception, We will return American astronauts to the moon.",1507334400,3,7785,4.669354838709677

I'll buy that with no argument.  But I don't buy into half-baked attempts by crackpots and jealous Limeys to turn a marvel of engineering and technology into a hoax. The Limeys should stick to the only thing they know; sticking their lips on the bloody bums of useless royal bums.",1501891200,,433,4.6103896103896105
