Only gave it one star bc I couldn't give zero stars",1428019200,8,250,3.7884615384615383

6877561,1,B00QR1K0UG,"I enjoy low-budget movies.  I enjoy independent features.  This was however, one of the single worse movies I have ever seen, and one of a very small handful of movies that my Saturday movie night group has actually turned off.  This group has been meeting for DECADES.
The only solace I have in watching this movie (part way) is that I may be able to spare someone else the waste of their good times.",1439856000,,401,4.391891891891892

6877567,1,B00QR1K0UG,"It was not mentioned in the description that it was in Chinese and had subtitles. As others has stated, it's a bad movie and only watched a few minutes of it.",1429488000,4,158,4.129032258064516

6877569,1,B00QR1K0UG,Waste of money!  In Chinese.  Could not even watch after a few min.  Joke.  I want a refund!,1428624000,5,92,3.9444444444444446

8692423,3,B00QR1K0UG,"Nothing to write home about but OK for an evening with a bowl of popcorn.  Some decent fight scenes.  Too many flashbacks that didn't contribute.
 Subtitles.",1508112000,,157,4.961538461538462

8692425,4,B00QR1K0UG,"What's not to like?  zombies with decent makeup, plenty of gore to go around, and several awesome martial arts scenes...

I suspect everyone who rated this as 1 star was just made that it is Chinese with subtitles...  frankly, I love foreign flicks, so I have no qualms with dealing with a few subtitles...

Overall...  I thought this was a really well done zombie flick...  two thumbs up from me...",1507507200,,399,4.628571428571429
8692426,1,B00QR1K0UG,Incredible waste of money. Amazon needs to tell people this is a subtitled movie. I never would have purchased it.,1464393600,,114,4.75
8692427,2,B00QR1K0UG,"I love zombie movies, but this was so so, at best.  Not so bad bad guys, non-scientific mad scientist, a robbery that was botched before it began (object of heist was ignored and hostages left alone - land lines intact and no one calls the cops).  Watchable for the devotee.",1462147200,,274,4.46
