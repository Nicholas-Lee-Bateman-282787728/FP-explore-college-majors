8706761,2,B00UGQK8QE,"I am very disappointed in the American President series.  It has many negative things about the presidents.  It certainly won't inspire children.  Instead it will instill in them a distrust of the government.  This is the opposite of what I would hope from a program like this.  You can find nice things to say about each president.  The leaders of our country all made contributions and were all great men.  Unfortunately, this was not the impression I got from your pessimistic DVD collection about the presidents. We want to inspire future leaders!  Do better next time.  I gave it 2 stars though because it does give a nice history of each president.  Although I am leery of using it because it is so negative.",1461456000,,714,4.685483870967742
