8634482,4,B00HR0V7X0,"Blood Rush begins by showing a woman sneaking around behind a dumpster before breaking into someone's house.  She sees a zombie woman aggressively eating meat on the floor in front of the kitchen cabinets.  The woman who broke in runs after the zombie woman, smacks her with a shovel and destroys her body.  The woman looks at the driveway and sees the zombie woman's guts all over.  She walks into the house, picks up a knife, hears flies buzzing, walks to the zombie woman's bedroom, opens the closet and then a woman under the bed grabs her ankles.  It's a woman claiming she was attacked by another friend of theirs.

A pregnant woman named Lucy is found in another room of the house.  Lucy wants to head to the hospital, but when the women start walking they see a zombie man crawling across the yard saying ""Help me"".  The one friend chops the man's head off in the tamest way ever, lol.  Their friend Danny comes by and they quickly drive away before the zombie gets them.  In church the people want to know when the internet will be up.  The mayor says the engineers won't be out until Monday.

One woman complains that her hair is beginning to fall out because there's something in the water.  Meanwhile in the car Danny and the girls discuss what happened to their friends.  Back in church a man says his dog was found with his guts ripped out.  The people try to rationalize it was coyotes but another woman thinks it's kids who are up to no good, and thinks stricter curfews should be implemented.

We now see a woman making a bloody Mary using a blender in her kitchen.  Meanwhile Danny's car breaks down leaving him and the girls stranded where zombies are roaming around.  One woman coughs up blood.  Lucy thinks she's going to have her baby in a ditch.  Back at home a woman calls for her young son Josh, but he's busy eating a bloody animal on his bed.  What a scrumptious meal young man!

Danny and one of the women (Kate) discuss when they're going to get back together, but he says it's a bad time given the whole zombie outbreak.  The group decide they need to rest.  We now see a man at his house tossing food and drinks from his refrigerator on the floor.  He sees a pack of raw meat and enjoys it a great deal!

Danny, Kate, Lucy and the other girl wake up in the woods the next day.  One girl wandered off at night and they want to know where she is.  At home the mayor gives his rebellious niece a lecture.  He says it's time to get her out of the house and get a job.  He continues that she's not his niece and never will be.  She says maybe it would be better for everyone if she was dead.

In another home a dad/doctor ropes his daughter on the kitchen floor around her wrists and ankles.  She screams ""I'm hungry!"" but her dad says ""Just shut up!""  Danny and the other girls find their friend.  She's a zombie!  She runs after Danny until an old guy smacks her from behind in the softest way ever.  The old guy says to the girls that they need to get out of the woods.  Right as the man explains he hasn't seen anything this crazy since aliens the girl comes back to life and chews on his face.

The rebellious niece wants to know why her mother had to go before attempting to take her life by swallowing pills.  The niece walks into another room where she's almost smacked by a man with a stick.  He says she's not safe here because of the zombies.  He wants to stay here with her until this thing blows over.  Outside Danny smacks an old man so hard we see an up close shot of his eyeball launch in the air.  Hilarious!  Danny accidentally steps on a man's head who responds that he has to find his 10-year old son for his birthday today because his mother died a month ago.

In another house we see a man at home.  His wife nags at him over carpet so he walks into the bathroom and rubs a towel over his blood drippy right eye.  Pregnant Lucy and her friend walk alone in the woods in search of Kate.  The dad/doctor at home with his tied up daughter on the kitchen floor finds out the zombie virus makes people hungry for blood and flesh.  He thinks he made a new discovery and will become famous.  His daughter is now dead with the top of her head missing.

Lucy and her friend wants a real doctor to deliver her baby- not a backwoods voodoo doctor.  They break into a cabin they stumble upon.  They wonder who lives here and think it's a man who performs ritualistic killings.  The owner walks in, and he's a black man who finds the two girls hiding.  He tells the two girls to leave and says the people in town are a bunch of racists.  ""Get out!""

In the next scene a zombie breaks through a bedroom window and pulls out a man sleeping on the floor.  The mayor's rebellious niece has another discussion with the guy she met at the house.  He thinks since she's the mayor's niece, he'll call the police and get the two of them out of here safe and sound, but she the niece says he doesn't really care about her.  This guy she just met wants her to travel to the city with him where there's phones that work.  In church the mayor asks about the townspeople's daily struggles.  The woman whose son was eating a dead body on his bed needs help.  Another woman says that's why she sends her kids to boarding school.  The other woman claiming the water is poisonous still insists something is wrong.

Pregnant Lucy and her friend head into what they think is a deserted building.  Lucy starts to panic and says her baby is coming.  Blood shoots from her private area as the baby twists her skirt and crawls out of the womb.  Lucy's friend smacks the baby with a shovel and it flings against the wall.  Clearly the baby's just a doll so this scene isn't really as graphic as it reads!

The doctor shows up to the church and the people wonder what's going on.  They think it's mad cow disease, but the doctor says it's a virus that affects certain parts of the body and believes it can pass from person to person but doesn't know how yet.  He needs to take some blood for testing.

Back with the rebellious niece and the guy she met.  They're still hanging around in the house with their backs against the wall wondering how to get out when the guy smells something nasty.  The father/doctor who tied his daughter to the kitchen floor cleans up his daughters blood after removing her body.  At church he coughs up blood and takes medicine.  A woman at church asks if he has the virus.  He says no but yeah, he does!

The group discusses the possibility of zombies  and curses but the doctor says it's a virus.  They also think the zombies poisoned the water.  They all leave church and head somewhere. The friend of Lucy's meets up with the rebellious niece and the guy she met.  They apparently know each other.  The doctor discusses that guy with the nagging wife and says sincerely ""If I was him I would've clubbed her already and buried her in the back yard!"" which makes his two friends angry.

The nagging wife tells her husband to look into that promotion and to take the trash out so it doesn't smell like last nights dinner in here.  She wants him to bring her tea in 30 minutes while she relaxes in bed.  When he does she continues nagging.  The husband climbs on top of her and she says ""No, it's not Saturday!""  She looks up at him after blood drips on her face and she screams over his new zombie makeover!

The doctor and the two guys he's with walk into the woods together.  The doctor has trouble hiding his blood coughing inner zombie.  The doctor and his two friends invade the black guy's home- the same man who kicked Lucy and her friend out of his house earlier.  He says he's just trying to take care of his grandson.  The doctor says he knows the guy experiments with dark arts.

The doctor tries to get the man to reveal his dark magic but he denies it and insists he's just trying to get his grandson out of here.  Lucy's friend is with the rebellious niece.  She apologizes to the niece while the two are outside because she did sort of treat the girl like crap.  While the two have a discussion a zombie walks across the street towards them.  Meanwhile the doctor has turned into a zombie and he's out in the woods too.  Danny stumbles into him and says to the doctor he has no idea how nice it is to stumble into someone who's alive.  Danny sees the doctor isn't well and says ""Yeah, you look like you kinda want to rip my face off right now, and I'd like to keep it!""

Danny limps away and Lucy's friend tells him to duck so she can smack the doctor with a shovel.  They discuss what happened to Lucy.  The racist guy insists the townspeople got what was coming to them.  The grandson thinks his grandfather put a spell on everyone in town and mentions how delicious he found a German Shepherd!  The grandson wants to leave with his grandfather but he refuses.  Outside the rebellious niece leaves Danny and his friend alone.  They come up with a plan.  Danny says ""If a zombie tries to eat my brains it's on you!""

The rebellious niece gets into a car with a young man and says she wants to head to the city.  Suddenly the man's nose starts  to bleed as they head into a dark tunnel.  Danny and his friend return to the racist man's house of voodoo.  Danny's friend knows the grandson.  The grandson says ""We can't just let them (Danny and his friend) run around out there with those things running around"".  Danny responds ""Oh yeah those things that you probably made.  What, do you have a magic wand in the back that you wave around a little bit. *poof* Screw the whole town!""

The voodoo man mentions an antidote that works when mixed with food and takes full effect in 48 hours.  Ungrateful Danny says ""You can make more!"" but the racist man says ""You got what you want, go on!""  Actually I get Danny's anger and impatience.  People are quickly turning into zombies man!  We see a mother and her young daughter playing piano together when suddenly the mother breaks out into an amazing solo... with blood dripping on the keys.  Uh oh, she's a zombie.  The daughter picks up a piece of skin and eats it.  Oh, so I guess the daughter doesn't have to worry about running away from her mother since she's part zombie too!

Remember the scene in the beginning of the movie when the one girl was a zombie and her friend had to destroy her body with a shovel?  She returns to her tied up zombie friend in the back yard where she feeds her the antidote in the hopes she'll return to normal.  It uh... didn't work?  Because she's lying on the ground covered in blood.  Meanwhile her friend is munching on meat in another part of the yard.  We're now seing a birthday party involving all these friends having a party outside.  Everyone's happy and celebrating as we see a mouse climb over a piece of rotten meat in the woods.

That ending didn't make sense to me.  Did the girl return to normal or did the antidote backfire and made BOTH friends zombies?  It sure looked like that second one to me.  The birthday party afterwards makes me think both friends returned to normal even though the scene prior says otherwise.  Very weird!  Otherwise a terrific zombie movie with a solid amount of time devoted to establishing each character, and creatively using each character in a way that makes sense later on when we realize many of them are friends.  Even though early on it might seem like a bunch of random people around town are having their own zombie dilemmas, these people all have a purpose!  Pretty good acting and solid story.  A small town zombie outbreak can work too and this movie proves it!",1501632000,,11557,4.324626865671642
8634483,3,B00HR0V7X0,"The special effect and soundtrack/sound effects used in ""Blood Rush"" are on the lower end but shot in a way that works. And the scenes that have no way around being noticeably cheaper, than what the crew would have liked, are done in a satirical manner, of amusement, that make those moments work as well. The soundtrack isn't all that memorable but does allow for some emotional carryover between the story, acting and audience. I just feel it could have had more energy put in with stronger music to really create a solid viewing experience. The sound effects are standard but do well creating a eerie atmosphere both in the dramatic scenes and the action sequences.

Overall ""Blood Rush"" is a good, indie horror that is entertaining. I liked the viral outbreak approach to the zombie-esque story telling. The transition from normal everyday citizen to crazed cannibal is far more terrifying to me personally than the dead rising up from the grave. The film has some minor drag when it comes to dialog, and dramatic interaction between characters, but not enough to cripple the film completely. ""Blood Rush"" manages to be fun and mature which isn't easily done. A lot of times a film's satirical elements can seem juvenile or the mature structure of the story falls flat. With ""Blood Rush"" things work and the story evolves both as entertaining fun, and gory chiller.",1431907200,,1369,4.85042735042735
8634484,5,B00HR0V7X0,"Great campy horror fun. If you love a bit of cliche and old school horror then this is a film for you.

I especially enjoyed the zombie baby and the kooky doctor who sacrifices his own daughter in hope of a cure for this cirus/curse.

Great fun and tounge in cheek humour. Love Don Donnelley as Danny, true anti hero.",1398384000,,317,4.266666666666667
8634485,5,B00HR0V7X0,"Definitely fun moments in this campy zombie/curse movie. Acting was solid and I especially enjoyed the fun effects like the flying eye ball and zombie baby.

It makes fun of itself and plays with the idea of a curse versus zombie mayhem. It has a good social comentary behind it, whereby the towns folk point fingers at the outcast witch doctor who lives in the woods, when it could be themselves who are spreading this disease.

If you want a night in with some mildly gorey, fun and not too serious horror flick. Then I would recommend this one!",1398297600,,547,4.515151515151516
8634486,4,B00HR0V7X0,"This film was fantastic!! For starters hats off to Kerry and Evan for creating this film. If you like the Evil Dead then you will LOVE this film. It has a nice balance of humor and scary!! If you take this movie as a serious dramatic horror film (if even these exist) then you will be disappointed. But on a level of the Evil Dead's of the world, well Blood Rush is right up there with those. I had a terrible day and had rented this film in hopes to escape and see something out of this world and the film is exactly what I wanted and more!! The performances in the film I thought triumphed over the likes of say an Evil Dead. Christy Lee Hughes who plays Lucy the pregnant one was so believable in her role. Basically she is trying to survive and have her baby. I also enjoyed the witch doctor in the film played by Myles Cranford. There was something so creepy and subtle about his performance. GO RENT THIS FILM it is a campy horror knock out!",1393977600,,947,4.180327868852459
8634487,3,B00HR0V7X0,"seriously this film as not that bad, it held my interest most of the time. if you know BD films then you know it's going to be low budget with low budget acting and ect....i usually sway towards hardcore gory violent films, this had a few ok moments but i found myself more interested in the core of the film...""what was the cause of the virus""...i really liked how the town MD looked for answers and fought through the virus himself looking for answers. overall i liked it, would i add it to my collection....no,but glad i saw it..give it a chance and don't be too critical. remember, it's independant low budget stuff.",1392681600,,620,4.495575221238938
8634488,1,B00HR0V7X0,"This is a low budget ""Brain Damage"" semi-zombie film. A virus infects a town which causes some of the residents to go slightly deranged and want to eat raw meat, both animal and human. It has a number of subplots in an attempt to hold our interest. One woman is pregnant and isn't feeling right...we know where that goes. A boy eats his dog and Rachel wants to shop over the Internet which is down etc. etc.

The acting was bad, especially when they attempted to lament over a lost loved one. The dialog worked in some corny lines, but that's what they were, corny. No one in this small rural town seemed to own a gun, making a shovel the decapitating weapon of choice with a few bad prop scenes. The film really doesn't go anywhere until the end, which was sad.

Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. Sounded like one quick F-bomb in the beginning.",1391731200,,845,4.375796178343949
