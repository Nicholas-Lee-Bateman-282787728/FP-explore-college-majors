4893815,5,B005UFUU6E,"I got my copy of ""The Tall Man"" complete series and am very happy with it. The transfers are pretty good and well worth watching. I thank Timeless Media Group for giving us the complete series.",1329782400,4,193,4.388888888888889
4893816,5,B005UFUU6E,"This is the story of the friendship of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. If you are looking for historical fact here in this series. Forget it. There are a few facts but this is purely Hollywood's version of Billy and Pat Garrett. This was the kind of TV show that would get me in trouble with my teachers in school [kindergarten].Made to stand with my face to the wall because I always said that people like Billy the Kid and Jesse James were really good guys and were lead to do the bad things they did because of the rich and powerful trying to steal their land or had done them or their families wrong in the past.
.But,this is a good  action-packed western all the same. Barry Sullivan plays  Pat Garrett as a staid and sermon-preaching kind of sheriff. While it is Clu Gulager as Billy the Kid that is the more interesting character as he gives his role a more exciting and edgy feel to it. This series only lasted two seasons. But it did run to 75 episodes.
I really liked this series. The more I watched each episode the more into the series I got. This is down to good stories and the pacing of each episode as well as the actors..Each episode had a guest star that was or would become famous. Martin landau,Jim Davis,Leonard Nimoy to name a few. The series ended without us seeing Pat Garrett kill Billy the Kid. I wonder if this series lasted longer if that would have been the series finale.
If you like westerns from the sixties you'll love this show. Like I said there is historical inaccuracy here but the show is very entertaining.
Once again,I have to praise Timeless Media Group for putting series like these out on DVD.",1329004800,21,1635,4.375
4893817,4,B005UFUU6E,I really enjoyed this TV series from my past. During this time period there were many shows of this type. Barry Sullivan played his role very good.,1326412800,3,147,4.481481481481482
4893818,5,B005UFUU6E,"In the heyday of the Western, prime time on the small screen was one oater after another.  Each tried hard to stand out.  Sometimes it was the gimmick of a special gun.  THE RIFLEMAN had his Winchester with a large loop and a metal spur.  In WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE it was a Mare's Leg.  In JOHNNY RINGO it was a LeMat revolver that also shot a shotgun shell.  Some shows had unusual music.  WYATT EARP, with its barbershop quartet.  SHOTGUN SLADE with, of all things, a jazz theme.

Then there were the 'sidekick' shows.  Wild Bill Hickok and Jingles.  The Cisco Kid and Pancho.  The Lone Ranger and Tonto.  Many shows had an older lawman/scout/investigator/you-name-it who taught an inexperienced protege the ropes.

Which brings us to THE TALL MAN.  In this one the experienced lawman is none other than Pat Garrett, and the youth he tries so hard to bring around to the good side of the law is Billy the Kid.  And in this regard, it's unique.  Because the dynamic between the two was unlike any other.

Barry Sullivan portrays Garrett as basically a good man who imposes the law fairly.  But he has his dark side, as he demonstrates when the sheriff is murdered and Garrett vows to kill the man responsible.

For sheer darkness, though, he can't match Billy.  Clu Gulager could have taken the easy way out and portrayed the Kid as a misunderstood delinquent.  But no.  His Billy Bonney is a stone-cold killer.  He loves to laugh and drink and have a high time with the senoritas, but make no mistake.  Cross him, and he will drop you dead.

The interplay between the two is where the show shines.  For Billy and Pat are friends, and Billy genuinely tries to do the right thing, as Garrett keeps wanting him to.  But the thing is, he's 'Billy'.  You get the sense that sooner or later he's going to snap, and when he does, all hell will break loose.

The show seldom pulled its dramatic punches.  Yeah, we're talking the '50's here, so don't expect, say, DEXTER.  But it could still be brutal, as in the show where one of Billy's girlfriends goes up to his room, unaware that two men are lying in wait to kill him, and takes a double-barreled shotgun blast to the face.

Clu Gulager is perfect as Billy.  He has the smile, he has the teeth, he gives a good sense of just how wild Billy could be, and when he turns cold, he's deadly.  That he realizes Garrett is the only 'good' friend he has, and that he tries so hard not to step over the line when we all know his ultimate fate, adds a sustained suspense and a pathos few Westerns achieved.

Before I forget, I should make mention of the score.  It's not as different as SHOTGUN SLADE, but it, too, is unique.  The music is by Juan Garcia Esquivel, and it brilliantly complements the dramatic elements.

So if you're up for a Western, and you've never seen THE TALL MAN, you might like it a lot.",1324080000,103,2848,4.403846153846154

As far as the series itself, it turned out to be much lighter than I expected a series about Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid to be. Clu Gulager is fantastic as the cocky young Billy the Kid, while Barry Sullivan acts as somewhat of a father figure.",1485561600,,317,4.283333333333333
4893826,5,B005UFUU6E,"Loved this series as a teenager. Love Clu Gulager. Be glad the show didn't stick completely to history or we'd been watching an ugly Billy the KId, as he was very unattractive, to say the least. So we get to enjoy a gorgeous Clu Gulager who is also a fine actor. Although he was 34, he easily passed for a much younger man.
Video quality is excellent, although a few of the DVD discs will not play in one of my DVD players, no problem in my other player. Never had this problem with DVDs before. Overall, very happy with my purchase.",1485129600,,533,4.235294117647059

He tells Garrett that he stole the money from a crooked politician in St. Louis and agrees to testify against him if the lawman will protect him on the return to Missouri since he's convinced that gunmen have been hired to kill him. The sheriff is reluctant to believe his prisoner's wild tale until he receives a telegram collaborating the theft and a notorious killer for hire appears on the streets of Lincoln.

The series pretty much is about the friendship between the two men. The episodes are filled with Garrett running a tight rein on his friend while trying to keep law and order in Lincoln County Territory! The story lines usually see Garrett trying to show Billy there's another way of doing things without using guns or violence. Some comedy throughout adds a nice touch.

4893864,5,B005UFUU6E,"The Tall Man was one of my favourite TV westerns when I was a young boy, so when I saw that all 75 episodes were available in a single DVD set, I took a chance and bought it. I say ""took a chance"" in the sense that not everything I liked as a child has aged well. No worries about The Tall Man. It is a remarkably entertaining series, even if not 100% historically accurate. That's a charge that can be leveled at almost all film, television, and novel treatments of Billy the Kid. The series redeems its romantic portrayal of the Kid through its portrayal of the titular Tall Man, Sheriff Pat Garrett. The title refers to Garrett's stringent morality and adherence to the law. (I admit The Tall Man sounds better than The Straight and Narrow Man.) Through Barry Sullivan's older Garrett's mentor-like friendship with Clu Gulager's young Billy, the series provides a good set of morality plays perfect for a 6-7 year old as I was during its original run. For older viewers, the guest appearances by actors such as Vic Morrow and Jack Hogan (the year before Combat! made them famous) as well as many other recognisable faces are a true delight. That is also true for the behind-the-camera work from legends like Sam Peeples and Tay Garnett.
  As for the transfer itself, it is absolutely sterling. The picture and sound quality are both outstanding. The menu is easy to navigate. I would recommend this set of DVDs to anyone who loves classic TV, especially westerns.",1419897600,8,1466,4.634615384615385

4893872,4,B005UFUU6E,"The 2 year hitch that is. I have never heard of this show but seeing the reviews on here and what the two main roles are, I decided to take the plunge. I'm only six episodes deep so far, and I can see there's some potential for better plots and teamwork later on. One thing that does concern me though, and that is the music. It's as loud or louder than when dialogue is ongoing. Some would call it jazz, but to me it's junk, not jazz. I just hope it's not so annoying I just don't drop the series altogether. I rarely hear music I can't identify by genre, but this is one of them - it's just all over the place and certainly not suitable for a western.

As lousy as White Comanche was, at least that sounded like some jazz on a western, but it actually wouldn't surprise me too much to find that the people responsible for the music on that turkey, were the same ones here.

I found out the music scores weren't from the same guy that did White Comanche, but by a guy called Juan Garcia Esquivel. IMDB had these things to say about his music, among other things. See if you see anything here that suggest jazz instead of junk:

""Recorded music in a distinctly original way, with unorthodox composition and arrangement styles, often incoroprating Chinese bells, jaw harp, bass accordion, organ, harpsichord, a mariachi string band, a chorus shouting out nonsensical scat in harmony, and bongos with a traditional big band setting.

 His style of music has been called ""Spage Age Pop"" and ""Space Age Batchelor Pad Music"".

My only wish is that they back off on the music volume some, and it's as strong as most any I have heard on a series, but part of that may be because I have to raise the volume in order to catch the full dialogue. I hope Juan's music got better over time, but given the IMDB description, I doubt it very seriously. I don't think I ever respected the music of Gunsmoke until I heard this stuff! The plots are going to have to go a long way in quality to make up for the annoyance of the music.

Update: I'm now halfway through the 1st season, and I must say it is a good series, even with the music. The opening theme shows you what the show is about. Basically that Garrett leads and often Billy slides from underneath a rock to show up. I must say, this is a pretty refreshing series overall. It seems very dusty and worn, but it works very well.",1395446400,11,2369,4.310112359550562
4893873,5,B005UFUU6E,We enjoy the old Westerns.  We like Clu.  It is fun to watch him play in these old westerns.  Really loved him as Rykker in the Virginian.,1390003200,,138,4.037037037037037
4893874,5,B005UFUU6E,"This is a very enjoyable adult series with excellent repartee between the two main characters.  I don't know if either the actors or the writers decided to impart the sense of dread that hangs over each episode, or whether it was just the knowledge of what history has told us about William Bonny and Pat Garrett during the Lincoln County New Mexico land wars; but there's equal parts respect and fear between them. Maybe that's just my perception as I slowly watch these episodes.  No binge watching here becasue I want this series to last a long time because I like it.  Now if Amazon could only put together a complete series of Wade Preston's ""Colt .45"" series...or John Russell's ""Lawman"" series, I'd buy them both.

I recommend ""The Tall Man"" series to any western fan as well as any fan of good acting and storytelling.  No, it's not Shakespeare but then what is?  Whatever this is, I am enjoying watching it and I believe you will as well.",1388448000,6,947,4.57396449704142

Clu Gulager is an excellent Billy the Kid, very believable and lots of fun.  Watch for the antics of the incorrigible McBean and his miscreant daughters; in one episode they steal Pat's horse and then make a complete monkey out of Billy, stealing his horse and taking his gun, leaving him tied up.

I remember paying $20 for a VHS video with three, half-hour episodes. Guest stars on these will surprise you. I saw Martin Landau in two episodes, Leonard Nimoy in two episodes, I counted Kermit Maynard in at least five of them, Andy Clyde in five or six, George Kennedy and George Macready even make appearances. Recommended for people who love TV Westerns guest appearances from celebrities who later became famous.",1329955200,46,716,4.645669291338582
