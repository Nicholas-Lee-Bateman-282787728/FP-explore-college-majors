8233007,5,B000YJ84HS,"Good refresher. A student of Kelly's.  Great trainer.  This helps answer the 21 foot rule, because you do not get to choose when the attack is going to occur.",1438819200,,158,4.413793103448276
8233008,1,B000YJ84HS,"There was not any word in description of the product, that DVD is actually DVD-R.
DVD-R means: it was not STAMPED on the industrial equipment, but was RECORDED !!! on the computer or some home equipment.
As a result: DVD-R can loose it's reading ability at any time!!!  Having on your shelf not real DVD, but DVD-R, you can never be sure,  that you have actually video. It can loose it's reading ability and become just a simple piece of plastic at any moment totally unpredictable.
The technology, picture was placed on the blank surface of those DVD-R, is 20 years old, at least. You can wipe that picture out simply by your finger.
So, that product is just a CHEAP TRICK.",1417305600,,674,4.516393442622951
8233009,5,B000YJ84HS,This is strictly for those who are already well advanced in personal defense and firearms training!  One should NEVER attempt to learn this without the direct involvement of an experienced instructor.,1387843200,,200,5.451612903225806
8233010,5,B000YJ84HS,"...the concept of ""familiar task transfer"".  It became the foundational concept for all my personal combatives training. Bought it from Paladin Press on VHS 10 or 11 years ago and I still consider it one of the most important instructional videos I've ever viewed.  McCann demonstrates how to integrate empty-hand skills with a knife and a handgun. The ability to assess a close quarter situation, discern a legitimate threat, & be prepared to respond to a sudden attack happens as suddenly as a finger-snap.  This is not a beginners tape!!!  You need a background in basic & intermediate handgun skills.  As he says, 50% of all law enforcement officers killed over the last decade were at a distance of 0-5 feet.

The ""ACTIVITY ZONE"".

Utilizing four very simple, very deadly, & very common criminal attacks,...

1. The Slap & Tap

2. The Jailyard

3. The Jackknife

4. The Smash & Slash

...McCann has carefully produced, with a lot of forethought, a video that can definitively empower by accurately informing.  My highest recommendation!!!",1370649600,,1043,4.994186046511628
8233011,5,B000YJ84HS,"This dvd has great info on close range use of your handgun. I wish it was longer, its only an hour long. however the info provided is excellent and i would recommend it to anyone who uses a handgun.",1350950400,,198,4.102564102564102
8233012,3,B000YJ84HS,"The dvd was good in that it was a close quarters shooting dvd, the instructor is great and does know his stuff, however it should be understood this dvd is only one step in many to be taken in this area of firearms training, but its a very real and needed step to understanding the dynamics of shooting within arms reach.",1341360000,,321,4.278688524590164
8233013,4,B000YJ84HS,"This video is an excellent reference for anyone who carries a pistol for self defense. It provides clear, no nonsense techniques to use under the most extreme circumstances. It is not for the novice, or recreational shooter.  The techniques shown require the practitioner to have expert knowledge of the fundamentals.  McCann's professionalism is made abundantly clear by his insistence on and adherence to safe practices while doing this  training.

While this is an excellent production, this is the sort of training that you pray you never have to use. Nontheless, if you are a military, security or law enforcement professional, or a legally armed citizen, you should be aware of these techniques. Consequently, I recommend this highly.",1340236800,,740,5.299145299145299
8233014,5,B000YJ84HS,"I have bought and studied many, many of this kind of training aid - most are overly complicated to the degree that they are not effective in the real world.  Very similar to hand to hand martial arts - there are techniques that look real nifty and like something Bruce Lee could pull off - and then there is stuff that will get you out of a jam.

This is a very practical training aid - one that you can immediately put to use with minimal training - but also one that will be of real world utility to someone with extensive training.

My highest possible recommendation to anything by Jim Grover / Kelly Mccann and also Gabe Suarez.

No finanical affiliation with either of them by the way - just a guy who has wasted a lot of money looking for stuff that works.",1251849600,5,763,4.241379310344827
