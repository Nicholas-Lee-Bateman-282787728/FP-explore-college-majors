3062227,3,B00116GECK,"Yeah- the songs were great, but the CD lacked the features that I loved from the previous years.  The menus are easily navigated through, but after searching and searching, I still couldn't find the sing-a-long videos.  There have been cool animated video tracks that supplement worship time in previous DVD's, but this DVD only features 4 of those.  They do however plug their new ""BIG"" curriculum.
That's okay- it's just that I was left wanting because of the precedent established.  Only some of the video files are available at [...] - you can also find them at [,,,] for an additional download charge.
Great music though...",1245715200,6,628,4.89622641509434
3062228,5,B00116GECK,"My 2 year old is in love with this DVD, it really keeps him occupied which surprised me. He Gets so excited, we have t limit how much he watches it, because he screams with Joy, I mean litterally...He raises his hands in the air, and really is worshiping. But to him, it's just having fun. You will be shocked how much your kids like this DVD, even just as good as cartoons! We do not play this at bedtime, because he gets REALLY fired up when we play it. Especially when I clap along with him.

For the other reviewer who say this one ""lack features"" It does have the lyrics which your child can sing along with. I think they had to make a choice, Take out songs, or add more features. The DVD concert is so long, and therefor you are really getting mare than your monies worth.",1231459200,3,779,4.158940397350993
3062229,5,B00116GECK,I have to say that this is hands down my favorite kids video. My daughter loves the songs and stories. She dances around the living room and sings her little heart out.
