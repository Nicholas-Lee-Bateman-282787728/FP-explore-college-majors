Ruby an underrated Kennedy/Gangster flick by John Mackenzie (Long Good Friday). I soon began to realize although playing allotta dicks in mainstream films. His little known films show him pooring his heart out performance after performance. I soon started tracking down films. Seeing how rare this was I snagged it and was hugely entertained. The photography was magnificent.

Danny Aiello plays an enforcer trying to run take over The North Carolina moonshine operations from the local hicks. One is the main character riding around in a car. Raymond Serra a lucky character actor who's appeared in Marathon Man, The Family Enforcer, Hoodlums, Prizzi's Honor, Sugar Hill, Gotti & Wannabe's.

This movie is great. Plays like Dukes Of Hazards meets Goodfellas in this great hicksplotation film. Definitely worth the money. To bad copies are rare. Only 1 left. Hope whoever gets it enjoys it.",1319155200,,1008,5.177914110429448
