8631369,5,B00HAMQ06Y,"The 30 for 30 series features some of the finest sports documentaries ever made for TV, no doubt there, and this is one of the best of the bunch. It examines an issue that becomes more outrageous the more one thinks about it:  the fact that extraordinarily gifted athletes can't sell their skills professionally until they've worked for free, for at least three years! All so that many billions of dollars a year can flow to the completely corrupt NCAA slave system.

And that's what it is: a slave system. What else to call athletes working all day, all year, for room and board and an education that most of them have little time to complete? The case of Maurice Clarett shown here is especially disgusting. This kid could have made many millions of dollars a year in the NFL straight out of high school. But instead he, like all other student-age athletes in the US, was forced to give that million-dollar earning power away for free to the slave masters of the NCAA. So, bucking this system, he bailed on Ohio and their slimy, slippery weasel execs---who come off as barely better than evil here---and, because the NCAA has made a completely immoral and unethical deal with their equally slimy NFL-owner brethren, he couldn't play football anywhere. Unbelievable. So he started drinking heavily, fell in with the wrong crowd, and threw his life away.

I used to think that was entirely his fault, but this film shows how one-sided that view is, and how most of us got it: from believing the media, who of course benefit massively from the college slave system. Their billion-dollar contracts would cost them even more if college players were fairly compensated for their time and skills, and why not: THEY are the reason for those billions of TV dollars! NOT the slimy old men who smirk at press conference podiums as they steal all that money from these boys' families, and steal the best years of these kids' athletic lives. These men and the tv channels who pay them but not the kids are nothing more than scummy thieves.

As the film points out, and as Clarett did the math on, football players only get so many hits before their brains and bodies give out. The NFL concussion lawsuits have proved that beyond doubt, as have the many dead young and middle-aged men...dying so these slimy old men can get richer, while the college kids destroy their bodies for their slave owners. And it is truly slavery. I would have laughed at that statement until I really learned all the facts over the past few years; now I know it barely scratches the surface.

Clarett saw through it, sued, won the suit, and then of course the Old Boys Network that runs this country kicked in, and the appeals court chucked that wise decision so that the rich could get richer on the bodies of dead athletes. Which is in fact what it all really adds up to.

The directors of Youngstown Boys do a very good job of pointing that out here, and in general this film hits all the right marks. Crisply edited, artistically shot and with many tight interviews, it tells the stories of Clarett and Tressel well. Clarett's mother is the real hero here, to my mind, an extremely compassionate and caring person with the patience of ten Jobs. Tressel gets a break he doesn't deserve for not supporting Maurice in his tough times, I think. Anybody can reappear when things are going right, but it takes a truly fine man to be there throughout the tough times. Like Maurice's father, Tressel bailed when he was really needed. I also wish they'd shown more about the car issue, as the MC wiki tells far more in a paragraph than they do in ten minutes here. Clarett is no saint either, no question there, but rarely will you see a man who learns his life lessons more thoroughly, or wants to share them more kindly.

Youngstown Boys really sticks it to to Jim Geiger, a legendary slimeball who epitomizes the greed and scumbaggishness of the NCAA. His weaselly face at the press conferences says it all: he knows he's lying, we know he's lying, and he comes off as one of the lowest, fakest people you'll ever see in the sports world...and that's no mean feat. It's a nice thought that this film could be his legacy. What a total jerk in every way. I wonder if he'd let this treatment happen to his kids? Yeah, right. Only the poor folk get this kind of reaming, right Jim? He epitomizes all that is corrupt and greedy and selfish in our billion dollar college sports slave system. A truly evil crook who profits off the misfortune perpetuated by the crooked system he loves so much.

The film digs a bit into what it means to grow up without a father figure, a major issue in many of these athletes' lives. It's good to see Tressel fill that void for Maurice, then sad as he basically abandons him to side with the U of Ohio's miserable attitude towards anyone who DARES try to get the money created by his skills, money that is rightfully his, NOT theirs. The Ohio execs come off as total scumbags here, but then most universities are complicit in this slave system. History will judge them all very harshly as the facts continue to emerge, even as the media purposely ignores this story for their own greedy ends.

A big hurrah to Jim Brown, not only a great ball player but much more importantly a great man. He stands up for what is right here, and the contrast between his morality and logic and the greed of the old Ohio University scumbags is there for all to see. What incredible shame those men and their families will---and should---feel over the next decades as more and more people watch this. Their comfy lives and million-dollar salaries are built on the suffering of these kids. Sickening.

All's well that ends well, this film seems to say...but is it? No way. This slave system continues, the rich old men continue to steal these kids' money and health, and we all support them by not demanding that these world-class athletes be allowed to sell their skills on the open market, like any American should, if this was in fact a truly free country. But as Youngstown Boys points out, that freedom is in so many ways a media myth designed to make more and more money for those who already have more than they could ever use, while stealing it from those who can barely feed their families. And that is pure evil. Period.

That's the real lesson of this excellent film, a sports doc that easily transcends its genre. It's not perfect, but it raises questions we almost never hear about, because once you know about them, you see how corrupt our college system is. Not just in sports, not only the massive salaries for 20 assistant coaches etc, but also the various no-show, hugely padded positions for relatives of the regents and coaches and other scammers, making a quarter million dollars a year or more, for doing nothing of value, or even nothing at all...while the kids who generate that money don't see a dime, and often end their college careers in debt...or go to court for daring to sell a signed ball for fifty bucks! They very often end up with less than nothing from the American college sports slave system.

Nothing but broken bodies, half-assed educations, and endless college loan debt. We all have to stop supporting this system. It is truly sick and it hurts this country in ways we can barely see, but which we all feel. This level of corruption rules Wall Street and our government as well, and will until we see how endemic it is, from top to bottom, and demand that it end by not supporting it. So let's all stop supporting it!

This film is streaming here and on netflix; take an hour out of your life and watch it. It's more than well worth your time and your consideration. And seeing as the whole series is often nearly this good, buying this one disc for over ten bucks makes little sense when you can get all 30 docs on blu-ray for under fifty bucks. That's a great deal. If only our student athletes got anywhere near that deal.

PAY OUR COLLEGE ATHLETES WHAT THEY DESERVE!

Thanks to ESPN and the Zimbalist brothers for making this film; it is both art and education.

And thanks and well done to Maurice for his excellent blog (look it up and check it out, it shows his true growth as a spirit and man) and for learning what truly matters in life. You've got a great Mom there, bud! God bless both of you, and your family, and the families of all the hundreds of thousands of college athletes who never make the pros or see the profits from their talent, while others get rich.

You all deserve so much better, and when more of us raise our voices like Maurice Clarett, you will finally get it.",1416873600,,8608,4.532517707662588
