1843858,4,B00008G8MM,"Just One Of The Girls is an awesome, funny movie!!! I have been looking for it for a while, would love to own it, but REFUSE to pay almost $500.00 for a movie.....SORRY!",1268956800,4,169,4.151515151515151
1843859,3,B00008G8MM,"I had fun watching this move. It's to bad Corey Haims carrier
has fallen and this is when his carrier started to fall but
Just One of the Girls is funny and fun, but the funny parts in the move don't come rite away but it's there. But I was surprised and kind of excited to see Alanis Morissette in the movie.",1076457600,2,309,4.0
1843860,4,B00008G8MM,"Just One Of The Girls is a fun movie that will make you laugh. Corey Haims character starts to get bulleyed at school, and after many attemps to make peace with the bully fail, he takes matters in to his own hands. He figures the only way to stay at the same school, yet not be recognized by the bully is to dress as a girl. Now things seem to work fine until he gets this huge crush on a girl who has taken him under her wing. Now the girl also happens to be the bullys sister. This is a silly movie based on the earlier movie titled JUST ONE OF THE GUYS. You will also see then teen pop star Alanis Morissette as the singer. I do recommend this fun movie, and can't wait till they release License To Drive on DVD which also stars Corey Haim which is a hilareous movie as well.",1064707200,14,778,3.9935897435897436

7982886,5,B00008G8MM,"Old movie I bought for my collection.  It is dated, with both the method of acting and characters, but it was a hit back in the day. You won't be disappointed.",1426291200,,159,4.129032258064516
7982887,3,B00008G8MM,Very comedy funny. But don't have closed captions. Look like copy DVDs  Damn!,1425427200,,77,4.923076923076923
7982888,3,B00008G8MM,"Very dated teen comedy that acts as a sort of sequel to an earlier 80's teen romp. A teenager cross dresses as a lady & disguises himself with some ulterior motive behind this charade.

 Not too bad comedy wise, so I would have rated this film PG (maybe 11 & up) because there is nothing too extreme in this one compared with other movies of this genre, but certain not a great film by any means.  There is some mild entertainment, but other wise this movie is fairly tame & mildly funny.",1420243200,,488,4.282608695652174
7982889,5,B00008G8MM,"Movie disc was clean free of scratches or marks
Securely wrapped so well a truck could run it over and it would work well
Plays great
I love it",1409184000,,143,3.9655172413793105
7982890,5,B00008G8MM,"Really funny. Lots of subtle little one liners.  The father is pretty funny as the confused but concerned parent. The tough guy is adorable but starts out as a jerk.  If you watch it with nobody's perfect you'll get the two a little mixed up but still really fun. Esp when he walks into the computer lab as Chrissy and asks for Dan, takes him behind the school and reveals it's his best friend Chris, Dan says, disappointed, ""I didn't think it could be this easy...""",1393113600,,466,4.406976744186046
7982891,5,B00008G8MM,I got to see the sequel to just of the guys. I didn't even know the was a sequel to the movie until I saw it on the internet at this website.,1378857600,,141,3.4375
7982892,5,B00008G8MM,"I found this to be an interesting purchase. There were two versions of this movie - a sanitised ""made for TV' version called Just One Of The Girls and a slightly more raunchy version exactly the same except for one scene called Anything For Love which was available here in New Zealand for hire only from the video stores.
The Just One Of The Girls version talked about here has the raunchy content so is definitely the one to have. I read comments made earlier about this having been taken from a video on to a dvd and quality was a little disappointing. Definitely NOT so with the copy  I received. The quality was unbelievably excellent - if I didn't know better it was pretty much full dvd quality. Thank you to the publishers in making a quality version of this movie available for purchase considering its age and therefore limited appeal on today's market.",1367280000,,863,4.567741935483871
7982893,5,B00008G8MM,"I just love pretty much all of the ""two Coreys"" films. Utter cheese and stupidity, but I grew up with these guys. Corey Haim sadly passed away not too long ago, but the movies he made I still watch frequently. This one in addition to License to Drive and Dream a Little Dream are my three favorites. Something about this particular movie, though. Maybe it's Nicole Eggert's award-winning role (haha)... or Alanis Morrissette's cameo in the middle and end. Whatever it is, I just like it, as cheesy and bad as it is.

Just recently picked up the DVD version of it, which I have found is completely lacking in picture quality, unfortunately. It was an offical DVD release (though you can get DVD-R copies from the internet, I wouldn't advise that), but even though it's ""official"", the picture quality looks like a direct VHS rip... of course, this low-budget movie isn't going to look amazing on an HD TV anyway, even with an upscaling DVD player (like I have). But still, I expected the colors a little more vibrant and the overall clarity improved, and less grainy.

Anyone else have a problem with the picture quality (that is, if you have it on DVD)? The company that distributed it/released it is called Platinum Disc Corporation, out of La Crosse, WI. Comment if you have this exact version and what your opinion is of the picture quality/transfer.

Thanks!",1289779200,,1362,4.714285714285714
