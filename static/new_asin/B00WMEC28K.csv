8713787,2,B00WMEC28K,"This comment refers only to the ""Mr. Bongo"" version, which is a horrible, pale, washed-out transfer lacking in depth and definition.  The film was very hard to obtain for many years (I saw it at the theater on its release, and only found a French DVD in the 90s), so this release may suffice for some, but the Criterion Blu-ray, while more costly, is vastly superior.  The transfer is clear, with excellent contrast and good definition.  I have no idea who's behind the ""Mr. Bongo"" logo, but it's a shame they didn't work a bit harder at restoring this film.  Avoid their release, and get the Criterion (even the Criterion DVD is better than this Blu-ray).  There are review sites online to which you can refer to confirm this.",1517961600,,727,4.604651162790698

8713790,3,B00WMEC28K,"Having seen many documentaries about Orson Welles, and being a Welles fan, big time, heck I even interviewed Henry Jaglom, but this movie has yet to grow on me... It skips and jumps as if pasted together by a film school student, and it's impossible to follow the (or any) story unless you're as into Shakespeare as people buying this movie is isn't Orson Welles. The battle scene is fantastic but everything else is hard to understand, and the ""young boy"" who Falstaff mentors looks around 35. Hopefully this review can be edited to something better, and on my site cult film freaks dot com, there will be a triple feature review on Welles does William: MacBeth is a cheap yet cool Film Noir adaptation and Othello is by far his best of the bard, looking fantastic despite taking four years going back and forth to film... It doesn't show, and the movie flows. FALSTAFF (CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT) is a different story, and I'm praying to get really into it like those (including actor Simon Callow, who's written books on Welles) who feel THIS is his true masterpiece. Personally, I think it's TOUCH OF EVIL, but... anyhow... FALSTAFF does look creative, and yet jumbles all over the place with horrendous edited, alas.",1460851200,,1214,4.731132075471698
8713791,5,B00WMEC28K,"Unique and wonderful, and a marvelous restoration of the original film.  This is a mash-up of Henry IV Parts I and II, with the focus on inimitable Falstaff of Orsen Wells.  Which is not to say that other parts are neglected, but this is Wells' show, and if you have not seen it and love Shakespeare, this film is a unique must!",1450742400,9,328,4.274193548387097
