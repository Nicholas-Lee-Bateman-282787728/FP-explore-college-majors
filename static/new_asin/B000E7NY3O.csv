8106898,5,B000E7NY3O,We have several dvds of Jane Eyre (we obviously like this particular version of Jane Eyre). The other film is a low grade transfer. So I'm not reviewing the film but rather the trasnfer (you will understand if you too have been looking for a good transfer).,1507334400,,257,4.48936170212766
8106899,4,B000E7NY3O,"I was collecting different versions of Jane Eyre and found this to be a pretty good one.  Of Human Bondage was the extra for me, and was really a good find.  Remarkably done and acted.  For the price, I was surprised at the value of the films, though the presentation of the dvd lacked.",1346889600,,286,4.2592592592592595
8106900,1,B000E7NY3O,"If this was the best print that R. C. Walker has found of the film ""Of Human Bondage"", then it's hard for me to imagine what the other releases can have looked like.

Going on Walker's recommendation - one of the ""helpful"" button clicks is mine, but that was before I saw this thing - I bought a copy of this flipper-disc double-feature DVD (thank goodness very cheaply), and it turns out to be MUCH worse than the poor copy currently available for rent from Netflix. According to a review of the movie posted at that website, there is one good release much more highly recommended, but no longer in print, and no longer available for rental. It also gets good reviews here at Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-Code-Hollywood-The-Risque-Years-Of-Human-Bondage-Millie-Kept-Husbands/dp/6305436339/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre-Code Hollywood - The Risque Years (Of Human Bondage / Millie / Kept Husbands)</a>, issued by ROAN. This is three movies on two discs - presumably one disc is a flipper, rather than having two films squeezed onto a single side. But unfortunately it's now out of my price range, and I haven't seen it.

Walker may have been happy with this print, but I sure wasn't, and I can't believe you will be. As bad as the Netflix copy was, it was far better than this one. But I can't identify Amazon's listing of it, because the cover art doesn't match anything here.",1280102400,3,1436,5.212121212121212
8106901,5,B000E7NY3O,"the quality is great ,i bought ""Of Human Bondage"" on other dvd's, and the picture isn't that great, i ran across this double feature that also has ""Jane Eyre"" digitally Remastered at a Dollar Tree,i was very impressed. i highly recommend this dvd if you're looking to buy Bette Davis ""Of Human Bondage"" this is the one to get.",1207699200,5,326,4.5423728813559325
