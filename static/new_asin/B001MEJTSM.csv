3696456,5,B001MEJTSM,Great christian humor!!  Good for opening at any church or christen meeting to lighten everyone up.,1281916800,,99,5.1875
3696457,2,B001MEJTSM,"This was more of a counseling session than a comedy DVD. Love the comedy, will pay for a therapist is needed.",1272153600,,109,4.238095238095238
3696458,5,B001MEJTSM,"Have other dvds with Jeff on them and even to hear the same joke again is funny as the first.  Had a chance to see, or listen to him in person and would travel miles, even states to see him again. One of the greatest CLEAN comics around.  Would rate him #1.  Even buy second and third copies for other family.",1262822400,9,309,4.032786885245901
3696459,5,B001MEJTSM,"This is so raw and real! It is about God's grace. If you think your marriage has no hope to survive, then watch this together it may help save your marriage. Jeff's testimony is awesome! This is a must watch!!!!! Oh and it is also very funny:)",1252368000,8,243,4.191489361702128
3696460,4,B001MEJTSM,"It was enjoyable comedy at the beginning, but could have done without the ""preachy confession"" at the end of the program.",1249084800,,121,4.809523809523809
3696461,5,B001MEJTSM,"Jeff Allen is a funny Christian comedian.  THis video captures a side of his life and comedy, along with his wife, on how they have endured sorrow through the night but God made joy come in the morning.",1246233600,4,202,4.315789473684211
3696462,5,B001MEJTSM,"Jeff Allen is hilarious! But, what I think impressed me most was the powerful testimony at the end of his bit. Great for small group night!",1244246400,5,139,4.384615384615385
3696463,4,B001MEJTSM,Good clean humor - anyone with a family will relate to this. He also shares his personal testimony - and what change God has made in his life.,1234828800,4,142,4.107142857142857
3696464,5,B001MEJTSM,"If you are into clean comedy, the TV series ""Banana's"" is on 4:00am,
yep, AM, on Sat and Sun night's. I am hooked on it. Jeff Allen is one of the funniest comics I have seen since birth. His humor is about real life situations and his face and demeanor help make him who he is, A Star.
Put a tight belt on and get ready to keep you insides from falling out.",1234051200,5,357,3.904109589041096
3696515,4,B001MEJTSM,"This one will make you laugh AND cry.  Most (if not all) of Jeff's comedy comes from his life with his wife and sons. At first I had a hard time listening to his insults of his wife, but it is who he is.  He becomes completely vulnerable when sharing his testimony, but this time his wife is part of it and they both share the most intimate of their sins.",1445731200,,355,3.9859154929577465
3696516,5,B001MEJTSM,"Hilarious.......nothing more to say, except a laugh guaranteed!",1432080000,,63,7.0

3696518,1,B001MEJTSM,DVD didn't work properly.,1420416000,,25,5.5
3696519,5,B001MEJTSM,I happened to hear Jeff Allen from Pandora.  I have listened to bits and pieces of his bit for a while but had no idea of his conversion story.  One day a lot of his story was shared on air and I had to hear it all.  Took a while to locate this DVD but so very glad that I did.  He has a great story and I have enjoyed it over and over.,1415577600,,336,3.5
3696520,2,B001MEJTSM,Wasn't as good as I had hoped.,1412294400,,30,3.4285714285714284

3696522,5,B001MEJTSM,This DVD shows Jeff Allen at his best! Great material after a very difficult day and safe to share among a mixed group of friends.  Laugh at yourselves as you laugh at him.  Inspirational as well as entertaining. Highly recommend this DVD!,1376352000,,239,4.666666666666667
3696523,5,B001MEJTSM,This is such a funny DVD. Jeff Allen is awesome. He has a few minutes toward the end sharing about his life with his wife. I highly recommend this one! I laughed so hard for at least 45 minutes or more. So worth every penny spent on this!!,1373328000,,239,4.0
3696524,5,B001MEJTSM,"Jeff is extremely funny.  He has a real knack for looking at life.  On the other hand, when he spoke about his experiences of finding God in his (and his wife's) life he brought tears to my eyes.  If you want a real heart-felt testimony as well as some of the best comedy, don't pass this one up.",1363132800,,296,4.068965517241379
3696545,4,B001MEJTSM,"I bought this to show my Sunday School class cause his stuff on Pandora Radio is so funny.  To be honest, this isn't his best comedy work.

However the testimony of his wife and their early marriage is excellent.  I'll probably just show that section to the class.",1359331200,,264,4.458333333333333
3696546,5,B001MEJTSM,"Jeff Allen is a funny, funny man. But he is also a man with a great testimony. This video shows Jeff in a real way. It is an emotional video, and he will have your sides splitting in laughter and your eyes streaming with tears. I highly recommend this video.",1331596800,2,258,4.18
3696547,5,B001MEJTSM,"I think Jeff Allen is one of the funniest comedians of all time - Christian or secular! I got this for a few of my friends & family members as gifts & have heard nothing but good feedback. He's very authentic, which makes his humor that much more easy to relate to. He's also clean, of course, so you won't be embarrassed if your kids are watching it with you. I rarely say this, but you have to buy this!",1325980800,,405,4.075
3696548,4,B001MEJTSM,"A friend gave me this DVD.  I always am a bit skeptical when I am given a DVD/book/game, etc.  So, this sat around the house for a while.  One evening when the family was looking for something new to watch, we decided to throw it in.  The first couple minutes weren't too funny, I thought we had made a mistake.  But Jeff picked it up as he went along, and before long we were laughing until our sides hurt.  It really was great stuff.  Funny, clean, and if you are married with kids, very close to home.

One small caveat.  At the end of the DVD Jeff and his wife share their personal story.  It is heart-wrenching and gripping, but definitely not amusing.  It was unexpected, coming at the tail end of such a funny routine.  But, if you can change gears, it is a powerful testimony.",1321920000,3,784,4.258503401360544
3696549,5,B001MEJTSM,"We loved Jeff's side-splitting Christian outlook on marriage and raising kids! His admission to his ""brokeness"" is a true testament to the power of forgiveness that comes when we ask Jesus to come into our lives. Jeff proves that Our Lord is a loving God, with a wonderful sense of humor--- why else would he give us teenagers?",1317686400,,327,4.655172413793103
3696550,5,B001MEJTSM,Delivered on time. Good product. I would recommend.,1296432000,,51,5.5
3696551,1,B001MEJTSM,"Too serious. If you're looking for a laugh, this is not the video to buy.",1287100800,,73,3.933333333333333
3696552,5,B001MEJTSM,Jeff Allen is very funny.  His delivery is impeccable.  His humor is clean and family based.  Everyone should be able to relate.  But the testimony of Jeff and his wife was the best of all.,1286064000,6,189,4.314285714285714
3696553,5,B001MEJTSM,"Jeff has grown since I last viewed one of his videos. He is funny, and you will laugh, but adding their marriage testimony has given this video a dimension that is sure to minister to others that are going through a similar situation. It is poignant and real.",1284336000,4,259,4.416666666666667
3696554,5,B001MEJTSM,"I first heard the comedy of Jeff Allen on late night talk radio.  I am always impressed by comedians who are actually funny without using unnecessary profanity.  Unfortunately, they are not the norm.  Mr. & Mrs. Allen's testimony regarding their survival as a married couple was really incredible.  They are not preaching, they just tell their story of how their faith saved them.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for some laughs and also a story of the strength of having faith in God.",1283644800,3,500,4.7011494252873565

8321199,5,B001MEJTSM,This guy is too funny. Love his spin on everyday life situations. He is gifted and glad he made it. He is one of the funniest we have heard. It's nice to have a good belly laugh without profanity and sexual remarks. Highly recommend.,1483660800,,233,4.318181818181818
8321200,5,B001MEJTSM,"Was great CD and also was a Christian aspect of it, which I was pleasantly surprised about.  Learn a lot about this Comedian.",1481587200,,125,4.434782608695652
