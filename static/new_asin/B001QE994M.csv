8335484,1,B001QE994M,"For some reason, was difficult to load/play on my computer and when it did start to play it would 'blank' out every time I tried to jump around to different songs...",1469491200,,165,4.354838709677419

8335488,4,B001QE994M,"As an intermediate guitar player (15 years), I ordered this dvd as a complement of the tab book (playalong series) that i already bought before. Actually, it is just a performance , having Doug Boduch as the guitar player (excellent, by the way), with tabs underneath, and 3 different camera angles to choose from. Don't expect any "" put your pinky on the 4th fret, second string"" kind of stuff!!!, or any slow motion  playing...there is NONE of that!!!!. NO EXPLANATION whatsoever... just a performance with a very small introduction in the beguinning. I liked it..the playing is flawless, the sound: spot on....but not for  beguinners...I also own the SAntana, and Clapton dvd's...they are all lie in the same category....excellent as a complement, but don't expect any explanation or a tutorial...look somewhere else for that.",1366675200,8,829,5.133333333333334
8335489,5,B001QE994M,"Unless, of course, you are a beginner and you're expecting this DVD to magically turn you into an expert. (see other review).

IF you have basic chord knowledge and playing technique, then you can ""tackle"" this DVD. CCR is not too complicated and is actually a good place to start as a late beginner/early intermediate player.

The onscreen tab is very accurate and easy to follow too.",1342915200,5,385,4.731343283582089
8335490,1,B001QE994M,"This is not an instructional DVD. Nor is it for beginners.

The DVD bills itself as containing ""lessons"" from a professional guitar teacher for each song. These ""lessons"" consist of a little history of the song, then a VERY brief review of the tuning and chords. Then, the song is played full speed, with the tab underneath (in 2 of the 3 camera views).

The song is not begun at slower speed, or broken down into sections.
There is no tab booklet, or online access to the tab. It is onscreen only.

If you are advanced enough with your playing to be able to play along with this DVD, I'm not sure you need the DVD. If you need more instruction to learn the songs, look elsewhere.
For my level of playing (1 plus years), this DVD is pretty much useless.",1278460800,14,753,4.326241134751773
