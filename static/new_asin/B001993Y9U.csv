3427496,5,B001993Y9U,"I own DVD for seasons 1-10, watching them on Amazon TV with Prime is still easier than changing DVDs.

The actors are great, the characters are human, compassionate, professional.  They walk into people's worst day of their life - with their own baggage and personal problems and still get it done.

3427598,5,B001993Y9U,"A seminal TV Series, this one changed the look and the content of everything that followed and it made a short, chubby, bald guy a star. The stories are riveting. The one that had us on the edge of our seats (again after 19 years) from season 5 was ""Lost Israel,"" an episode in 2 parts. The subject matter was difficult at best, and the acting made it seem like we were in the station house watching the events unfold. Absolutely brilliant.

When you watch a show for its entire run, the characters tend to become ""friends."" Dennis Franz portrayal of Andy Sipowicz is a joy to watch. His evolution over the 12 seasons of the show is probably the most interesting I've ever seen on television. Season 5 is also the last full season of the Sipowicz-Simone partnership which is definitely one of the best ever on TV. Another standard set by this series.

It's difficult for me to review just one season of this show as I've always felt that the 12 seasons have to be looked at as a body of work and, as such, this one's a masterpiece.",1463875200,2,1031,4.364583333333333

3427721,5,B001993Y9U,"Season 5 of this fantastic show that transcended its genre and influenced so much of what came later is very strong.  The cliffhanger at the end of Season 4 is satisfactorily resolved, and not immediately or too cleanly either, and there are several standout episodes, particularly ""Weaver of Hate"" and its denouement between Simone, Sipowicz, and Fancy, ""Speak For Yourself, Bruce Clayton,"" which contains a top-notch action sequence, and ""I Don't Wanna Dye,"" the culmination of a sinister-themed multi-episode arc that is well-acted by everyone involved.  (In fact, Charlotte Ross was so good in it that she later landed a role as a cast regular.)  Titus Welliver and some other guest stars are also very good.

This was the last full season of NYPD Blue before the producers recognized that Sipowicz would be the prime focus going forward, and that resulted in some wonderful new directions and twists for the show as Andy interacted with his less-experienced partners.  However, this is arguably the season with Jimmy Smits' strongest overall body of work and as such, is not to be missed.",1459209600,,1093,5.05

The NY detectives have changed over the years, but we learn their back stories, and care about them all. Over 12 seasons we have seen most of the main characters change-- die, move on to other jobs-- but their appearance and disappearances are made to seem logical. Only Andy Sipowitz holds the whole squad together; while he is a flawed man in so many ways (racist, homophobic) we learn to care deeply about his life. For my money, best TV series ever made!",1457308800,,611,4.5636363636363635

3428003,5,B001993Y9U,"Amazon streaming out-performs NetFlix, NBC and PBS on my iPhone.  Goes online quickly. I've watched every episode of NYPD Blue at least 3 times, beginning with the first airing of each.  The Heroes & Icons cable network is currently airing ad-free episodes, and that got me into the Amazon listing.

I love Inner City Cop TV shows, and there have been good ones -- and not-so-good ones -- since NYPD Blue was retired.  One would think that TV producers would replicate the NYPD formula, but they simply haven't.  I'm a New Yorker whose professional career had me working with the NYPD (and the NYFD) for a number of years, and Milch & Bochco absolutely nailed the style, demeanor and, yes, the cynicism of the NYPD. Good, no-nonsense cops.  The dialogue is often so perfect that I will rewind some scenes a few times just to catch every word, and again experience the excellent acting and directing.

Of course the casting has been superb; even the actors who followed Jimmy Smits, as different as they were to ""Bobby Simone"", WORKED!  And I am thrilled to see Nicholas Turturro as a hugely believable NYPD Sergeant in Blue Bloods (my current favorite Cop Show). And Gordon Clapp as the Chicago Fire Chaplain...what a terrific casting for this special actor.

But, most of all, it was the casting of bit & supporting actors that set NYPD Blue apart.  So many have gone on to significant careers in major TV (and film) productions.

Watching these episodes now for the 3rd (and 4th) time, I find myself astounded by the quality of each episode, of each scene!",1453593600,,1558,4.712177121771218

3428629,5,B001993Y9U,NYPD Blue doesn't have the flash-bang of current crime shows but it has decent plot lines and I get a kick out of Sipowitz's dry humor.

3428690,5,B001993Y9U,so here we go once again.season 5 starts with a bang well actually the leftover results from the bang that ended season 4 Salvo is dead and it doesn't matter.  the results will be a better bonding of detectives Simone and Sipowicz.  and of course the relationship between Bobby and Diane. Yes the characters are so comfortable now in their roles first names are all that is needed at times.  Fancy and Andy butt heads but respect flowers betwixt them each season if not each episode. One of the story lines that had a 3 or 4 episode arch involves a bad cop who abuses his wife and commits a murder and tries to frame a mental patient for his crimes.  well his wifes character is played by Charlotte Ross. yes its Connie from a few seasons down the pike.  Actually NYPD is a fun series to watch because so many people involved all over the television dial passed through its doors at one time or another.  a few brief mentions so far. Dayton Callie with hair.  Anna Gunn At such a young age.  Peter Boyle as Andy's AA sponsor.  almost all of the men who became convicts in the series OZ have made showings.  Yeah Nypd Blue. I am now on season 7 and the hits keep on coming.,1408233600,,1172,4.286363636363636

I did not expect to be as hooked on this series as i was. I am a crime drama and mystery genre lover but few shows on TV grab me besides what is on PBS.

3428845,3,B001993Y9U,"I binge-watched the first 4 seasons of NYPD Blue, all of which I enjoyed. Season 5 was going along well, though perhaps a bit touchy feely in the emotion department (in regards to crimes), but the Lost Isreal came on. The actors must all be classically trained because none of them seemed to blush at the overacting/hamfisted lines they delivered. I mean, they even had an inexplicable verse from the Bible read aloud that supposedly moved all the characters with its deep meaning. Smits plays angry by gringing his teeth, Franz does it by covering his mouth with his fingers like his head is a bowling ball (which it very well might be). That was the 90s, though. Today if they wanted to show how artsy they were they woould whisper, which Hollywood feels is real art.",1399766400,,769,4.62043795620438

We loved the series way back in the early 1990s - watched it in Mass and London.

We are currently watching the series again and getting even more out of it the 2nd time around. We are up to Series 6 and so much better without commercials.

The asides from Dennis Franz remind me of the throwaway lines from all of the James Bonds.",1395878400,,360,4.202898550724638

And the nice thing is there were so many episodes that they can stand repeated watching; that makes it ageless. The only thing that irked me is the way they released only the first four seasons. Or was it five? That left no alternative but to look for bootlegged sets of the entire series. They should have released the whole series on DVD. I was very happy to discover that Amazon had the entire series on its Prime Service. In fact, that's a big part of the reason I subscribed to their service.",1393632000,,580,4.281818181818182
3428942,5,B001993Y9U,"NYPD Blue broke numerous barriers in the 1990's. Many people may remember it's ground-breaking (for TV) use of nudity and profanity. But it also set new standards for production, editing and ""in your face"" camera work. The show holds up well even after 15 years mainly because of character development and drawing the viewer in emotionally. To fully appreciate the growth of the series and its ability to produce 12 quality seasons of episodes, start with season one. David Caruso's role on this show may have been his finest work on TV (as compared to the caricature of a cop he played on CSI:Miami). Denis Franz is a joy to watch and he creates a memorable role that survives all 12 seasons.",1393545600,,693,4.688524590163935

3428948,5,B001993Y9U,"Even though David Caruso is a self-absorbed jerk in his acting, and the series improves on his exit, NYPD Blue starts out with a bang and gets better with age. Denis Franz is not only amazing, he is fabulous as Andy Sipowicz, a character of depth and strength. Even in weakness, he soars. The other cast members give convincing and reality based performances and the stories are remarkable in their depth of personality. I have never cared for 'police' drama's but this one is well worth watching.",1392768000,,497,4.724137931034483

3428980,5,B001993Y9U,"NYPD Blue pretty much calls the shots on the police procedural in a large city.  But it consistently tops the mark in character acceptance by audiences because of the mixture of life' s realities as created by ""call-it-like-it-it-is writing"" and the casting of actors with the ability to accurately personify those characters week after week.  And varying storylines give those actors the chance to demonstrate those abilities whether in the lead of each individual episode or in a support role.",1392681600,,495,5.175

I highly reccommend coming re watching this series or watching it for the first time.,1392249600,,387,4.375
3428986,5,B001993Y9U,"OK, we have over 300 cable channels, but they're largely garbage. When we discovered NYPD Blue on AMAZON, we said let's watch it again - all 10 seasons. So it's a reunion with the characters we loved and the ones that made us cringe.
We are really enjoying it all. I still marvel at the quality of actors who played the ""perps"". The crazies are so convincing that it's hard to believe it's an act. I spent 30 years as a hospital nurse and I've met these guys.
We watch it every evening and discuss it every evening. The characters are real, imperfect, human. We also marvel at how much technology has quietly seeped into our environment over the years. We're into season 5 and they still don't have cell phones!
Only the crimes remain the same. Happily, the NYPD usually vanquishes the bad guys in an hour.

3429186,5,B001993Y9U,"It's hard to review individual seasons against the background of the long arc of Blue's excellence. The steady character development and back-story revelations are the greater glue which binds the weekly case-studies into a deep and rich
continuing drama that makes me really care about these people. I truly want to see what makes them tick and observe how they go about discovering it for themselves... and/or NOT QUITE... or in tiny bits and pieces. They demonstrate the ups and downs, foibles and insecurities, successes and failed experiments in human interaction that I have in my own life. So I always learn something from every show that makes me understand the human drama a little more deeply. The writing and acting are top notch. They are completely believable characters. They are like me, or I know people like them. They give me insights. Every show makes me chukle and cry and think and reflect. It's gritty AND subtle Shakespearean sensibility amidst contemporary NYC scenery, language, and costumes. If you're asking me, Blue is the very best that TV has to offer.",1381708800,,1082,4.983425414364641

I saw but a few episodes..I loved to watch the story lines unfold and the personalities of the squad unfold over  the years. And since this show was airing about New York,when 9_11. Happened. I was warmed how the writers handled the tragedy on the show. With compassion and sincerity. I was sorry when I watched the last episode:(",1379548800,,489,4.821428571428571
3429211,5,B001993Y9U,"NYPD Blue is a cleverly written series about the mean streets of a Manhattan long gone by.  It was very frank and daring for its day, and it remains fresh due to the honest, though somewhat romantic voice of its characters.  The plots are gripping and entertaining.  The acting is mostly first rate, and it has wit and humor that is rare on the small screen.",1379116800,,358,4.393939393939394

3429216,5,B001993Y9U,"I loved watching NYPD Blue when it was on the air. I have never run across another show like it since. This season is superb. It was cutting edge back then (sex, violence, talk) but tastefully done...Kim Delaney did an awesome job as Diane and her acting was so convincing I cry every time. Jimmy Smits (better looking in person. I met him at an oil change place) was incredible. Supporting cast was also amazing. Rick Schroder is a great addition to the cast. But the BEST is Dennis Franz (I miss seeing him in anything) The Sipowicz character goes through so much pain and inner turmoil. He manages to break through. Although he is fictional, he is an inspiration. I also love the way the producers did the shots of the city, moving from spot to spot as you would with your eyes.

Please find a way to get this out the U.S. viewers as this is a U.S. series and not something that should be difficult to produce.

3429301,5,B001993Y9U,"Solid stories performed by an excellent cast, especially Dennis Franz as Sipowitz.  We could only wish that the networks today would produce a series of equal quality.  This series is for adult-only viewing as the series does show some low-level nudity and scenes of somewhat explicit love making.  This is the only criticism I would have about this show.  The unusually explicit sex scenes (for TV anyway) seemed to have been included to draw extra attention from the media and, ultimately, a larger audience.  These scenes could have, in my view, been toned back with no loss to the entertaining story lines.",1372550400,,610,4.9411764705882355
3429302,5,B001993Y9U,"My top five reasons why I recommend NYPD Blue Season 5: 1) "" Lost Israel,"" a two-episode arc involving two well-written story lines that parallel and then cross; 2); the strangely fascinating crux provided by a couple of liters of Coca Cola in ""A Box of Wendy""; 3) the almost ""Twin Peaks"" plot device referencing of the possible interpretations of 'Pop Goes the Weasel' and how it relates to Sipowicz' and Simone's current case  further irony is that the episode following this was titled ""Twin Petes""; 4) Charlotte Ross in "" The One That Got Away"" and "" I Don't Wanna Dye"" as the devoted then doubtful wife of a cop who's a murder suspect: this was three seasons before her recurring role as Detective McDowell; and 5) ""Hammer Time,"" which guest starred not only Terrence Howard, in one of his two small yet singular appearances (he returned in Season 6), but also Richard Brooks as a murder suspect, who would also return many seasons later as Capt. Eric Knowlton.",1372377600,,966,4.682352941176471

There still is no release of this show's remaining seasons on DVD, and who knows when or if there will be.  It's already been years since Season 4 was put out, and still no Season 5.  This might not be the ideal format, but Amazon has at last made the episodes available, and I for one am overjoyed.

I got into this show late and didn't see all of the episodes when they aired.  I saw a lot of the re-runs in syndication, but not all.  I've been hanging on the whole Joe Salvo cliffhanger for years, wondering if Sipowicz offed him to protect Bobby.  Finally, closure on that storyline!

Amazon's instant player is simple.  You can pause during the episodes, fast-forward or rewind in thirty-second intervals using the arrow buttons or click in the progress bar wherever you want, alternate to full screen or ""pop-out,"" placing the video in a separate window, and control the volume.  The one legitimate complaint is that it has no captions, so you're out of luck if you need those.  Otherwise, it's a user-friendly video player that I've had no problems watching on my laptop.

Highlights of this season include Sipowicz showing growth as a father and husband, and the progression of relationships for Bobby and Diane, as well as James Martinez and Gina.  The show doesn't back off of its trademark graphic content, giving viewers an up-close look at the daily tragedies that occur in a  big city like NYC.

Creating expectation with the ""drip-drip"" releasing of the seasons obviously failed. OK great... so then rather than the ""take my ball and go home"" thinking which seems to be what we're doing now, how about this. Create a single box set of all 12 seasons of the show... set a reasonable price point and be done with it.  Enough of the sets will sell and if marketed correctly, will probably yield a profit for everyone.

The other issue may be that Bochco and Milch think their poop doesn't stink and that their ""art"" is not going to sell for cheap.  Hill Street Blues seems to be experiencing a similar problem... how about LA Law? Maybe its a Mike Post thing... who knows? Maybe Dennis Franz is the hang up?

They are probably hoping this will create a bigger demand, and will come up with some way to release them that will suit THEIR needs (2-3 season boxed sets or some such).

3429547,5,B001993Y9U,"I keep hearing that the reason the remaining seasons aren't being released onto DVD is because they (the company) don't think there is a profit in doing so. Ok, so it took you FOUR seasons to figure that out??? You didn't have the luxury of releasing these on DVD as each season ended (ie. 'Lost', '24', 'The Sopranos' to name a select few), but instead relied on name popularity years after the show had run it's course, and ended. You canNOT tell me that 'Hawaii Five-O', 'CHiPs', 'The Munsters', 'The Greatest American Hero' and 'Quantam Leap'.....Quantam Leap for Pete's Sake!!!...these shows canNOT have more of a fan following, nor a better profit margin than 'NYPD Blue'....so what's the REAL reason???

Went to Amazon UK initially, but it wasn't there, so I thought I would definitely be able to locate it here. Unfortunately not. Like the rest of the reviewers here, I'll just have to wait in misery until the television company realize that there are many people avidly awaiting the release of season 5. I can't for the life of me remember the outcome of that cliffhanger.

P.S. I contacted 20th Century Fox at the e-mail address below. They stated
 ""It is unlikely that the remaining seasons will be released since they have not been thus far. However, we do not have additional information and due to the lack of information we cannot confirm nor deny if the remainder of the series will be released on home video in the future. We apologize for the inconvenience.""

3429592,5,B001993Y9U,I still cannot believe that the party responsible for the release of NYPD Blue stopped releasing the series after Season 4.  I spent $39.95 for each of the four released seasons with the intention of going for all the season releases.  I feel like I've been royally ripped off given that I certainly wouldn't have made the initial investment for seasons 1 through 4 had I known I would be left high and dry after that last release.  Thank you so very much!  Pretty darn thoughtless given that we're the ones that made this series as popular as it was.  It's a one-way loyalty I guess....,1301616000,,587,4.5
3429593,5,B001993Y9U,"I'm obviously not the only one frustrated by this travesty.  Over seventy reviews on Amazon for a product that doesn't even exist.  When I go to Wal-mart or the mall and see the plethora of crap TV shows that have every episode ever produced released on DVD, I get really frustrated wondering why NYPD Blue is missing eight seasons.  Could the sales for the first four seasons have been that bad?  That seems unlikely.  The first releases were in huge boxes with multi-panel cases.  Those are long gone, and have since been replaced with smaller boxes with thin individual cases for the discs.  I've seen these newly manufactured Season 1-4 sets sell out at my area Wal-mart stores two or three times already.  If they are making and selling new copies of the old seasons, why aren't they making the rest of the series?  What are they waiting for?

Like others posting reviews here, I don't know how to contact the people who matter in getting these DVD's made.  Maybe someone could start an online petition somewhere with decent visibility.  Possibly even direct someone at Fox to the growing number of people online clamoring for the rest of the series, including all the customers on Amazon.  I've seen a lot of popular products on this site with fewer than seventy reviews, which would seem to translate to a waiting audience with money ready to put down.

We have watched the first four seasons at least five times through, each time hoping that perhaps the rest of the series was on its way.  You can pretty much purchase the complete series of almost every show ever made, except for NYPD Blue.

It is such a terrific show that I began to really look forward to when the new season started.  I believe it is the finest drama ever created for tv.  The quality of the acting and the writing is what made it so good.  The most believeable criminals occured because these stories came out of real cases that Bill Clark (writer and later producer) and his buddies took from their memories of being on the job in New York City.  Over the years NYPD Blue became my comfort food.  Whenever, I was lonely, I would watch the first four Seasons over again.  Sipowiz was like the father I wanted to have.  While he was so rough around the edges, that you knew that if he had been your father he would have been tough on you.  Still he had a way of letting you know how he felt.  My own father had been a cop it had been a rough life and he was not able to express himself that way.  I just wish you could get the other seasons.

This is the very best of any Ploice series ever done. The charactors are all so well defined and each story is agem by itselfIt is very rare for any eposode to be anything but satisfying.
THE ONLY FAULT with NYPD BLUE is it is put out by probably the least customer caring company in existance. I feel sorry for the short financial stae that does not allow thm to employ a PR.to know oublic reaction or do thei no longer care

3429719,5,B001993Y9U,"Just like season five wraps up season four's cliffhanger, season six ties into the end of five. The first five gut-wrenching episodes from season six are some of the best TV ever produced, let alone from the series itself.

I have got nothing against other shows being released in DVD form - after all, they too have their fans. But why are the honchos at FOX dragging their feet on this fine show? NYPD Blue fans are a legion who deserve their quality time with Sipowitz and his cohorts.

On a final matter, speaking for myself, if cost is an issue, I have nothing against a bare-bones package being released as long as the 15th Precinct continues to see the light of day.

Do the right thing, FOX. Don't be like a twitch skell who needs their balls busted. Reach out and solve this case.",1215734400,8,789,4.427586206896552

3429721,5,B001993Y9U,"First off, let me say that I am a huge fan of this show.  I would absolutely shell out the money to buy the entire series.  But I just don't think it'll happen.  I'm not in the business or anything so I don't have any facts, but based on what I've seen released (or NOT released) from Fox in the last year, I doubt that we'll ever see any more releases of NYPD Blue.  It seems that they have abandoned most if not all of their ""classic"" library in favor of releasing new and current shows.  Almost all of Fox's TV library pre 2000 has stopped being released.  Or at least slowed tremendously.  I don't know if it's due to poor sales or what, but it's not looking good.",1214956800,3,668,4.131782945736434

In fact, we didn't even have a DVD player at the time so we watched the DVD's on my children's Playstation. Although we now own several DVD players I am still waiting for season 5 to play on them! Everytime I read a new list of ""just released DVD's"" and see some truly awful shows listed I wonder yet again, why the wait for more NYPD Blue? It is an incredible show and deserves to be completed - every single season released. I know that I would purchase a complete set today if it came out even though I already own seasons 1-4. It would be worth the extra expense to own this ground breaking show. Andy, Bobby, Diane.....we miss you! FOX network (I read somewhere that they own the rights??? is that correct?) please, please release the rest of the series! There are so many faithful fans who would purchase it!

I have never seen a critically aclaimed show like this be so slow to get to DVD???? It just doesn't make any sence, do they just not want to? That is my take at this point, at the rate they are releasing this series the average viewing adult won't have a long enough lifespan to buy all of the seasons.
