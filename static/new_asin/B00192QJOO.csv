3422383,4,B00192QJOO,"I just received my copy of this DVD so I can't review fully at this time, but I can give you some of my first impressions and pass on some key info I was looking for before I made my purchase.

For those who don't know, RBD: La Familia was RBD's most recent television show.  It aired here in the US, I think back around September of '07 and months before that in Mexico.  This show came out approximately 1 year after the 3rd season of Rebelde.  Although all the members of RBD are in this show (and a few minor cameos from recognizable actors from Rebelde), this show has no relation to the aforementioned novela or soap opera.  This show is its own self-contained ""on-location-filmed"" sitcom.  This program follows the fictional daily adventures of the RBD band members and each episode has it's own theme or self-contained story.  The members of the band all play themselves, but this is more like a faux-scripted glimpse into their daily lives.  Emphasis on the fiction.

Although I must say, even though I still enjoy watching the RBD members acting and fooling around on screen, I actually miss the soap operatic style of the old Rebelde show.  With the ongoing plot lines and continual betrayals and love triangles with a mix of silly humor here and there.  Since all of these stories are basically self-contained and side characters come and go, it's hard to get pulled into the story or care much about the situations presented.

This DVD set contains all 13 episodes of the series in their entirety and runs approximately 9 hrs, 38 mins.  I'm just saying for those of you who are so upset that the Rebelde season DVDs only contain ""highlights"" from the seasons.

Now, the DVD specs.  This DVD comes with all of the episodes spread throughout 3 separate discs. It comes in your typical single DVD-sized case with an additional slip cover.  Unexpectedly the manufacturers included a slender sponge in there to prevent the discs from slipping or coming loose during transit.  The show is entirely in Spanish of course, but also includes full English subtitles.  But now let me criticize Televisa and Xenon Pictures, the manufacturers of this DVD.  This program actually aired on TV in 16x9 Letterbox.  I have no idea why, but that's the way it was.  Now when I heard this DVD was finally going to come here to the states, I was really, really wondering if and hoping they would be anamorphic transfers.  How fantastic would that be?  RBD's first concert DVD, Tour Generacion was also in letterbox, but the DVD was non-anamorphic.  But, the most recent RBD live DVD, Live in Rio, was also in letterbox, but was surprisingly anamorphic which made that DVD that much more beautiful.  Sadly my wishful thinking went to waste because although this show is still preserved in letterbox this DVD is sadly non-anamorphic.  Which really sucks because although the resolution isn't that great, you can tell the production values on this show and on-set recording techniques and equipment were much better than those on the old Rebelde show.  So anyway, on my 50"" plasma the show looks ridiculous with its black border all the way around the frame.  Sure I can still zoom in using my TV and it doesn't look that horrible, but the problem with that is the English subtitles get cut in half.  It's really too bad because the members of RBD never looked better than they do in this show and you can tell the original source material was of high quality.  But sadly this transfer is simply lame and doesn't do it justice.

But hey, if you could care less about tech specs or have an SDTV, I'm sure you'll be more than pleased with this purchase if you're an RBD or Rebelde fan.",1216944000,16,3670,4.6521739130434785

My problem is with the physical product.  I've got through four different copies of this set and all of them have had defective DVD's in them.  Finally, purely out of the affection for the show, I kept the last one and was thankfully able to make do with a copy of a bad disc.

If you can get this show in a different format, such as digital, do so.",1235779200,5,446,4.261904761904762
3422392,5,B00192QJOO,"I watched this when it was on Univision and thought it showed the great comedic abilities of RBD. While I am a big fan of the Rebelde soap opera, this just had less drama, which was a refreshing change, and seemed more personal with characters that included some characteristics of actors playing them. It provides English subtitles which is necessary for anyone who doesn't speak Spanish at all or has a limited knowledge of the language. Unfortunately, the subtitles aren't always the best translation or cover everything each character says, but that is hardly Televisa's fault and the general idea is still there. Overall a great series, that seems will never have a second season since RBD announced that they are breaking up.",1224806400,4,731,4.951219512195122

8271620,3,B00192QJOO,"The first DVD doesn't work correctly. It looks fine and it's authentic, but I constantly get error messages saying that there are a lot of damaged parts when I'm trying to watch it, or it isn't recognized by the player. I managed to watch the first 2 episodes (1st DVD) somewhat ok, but I would constantly have to eject and re-insert the first DVD. I can only watch the first 10 minutes of the 3rd episode before the damage parts error shows up. As of right now, the second DVD is perfectly fine and I'm assuming the third DVD is also fine.

I think it's rather odd that a lot of customers are also complaining specifically with the 1st DVD being the main issue. On my laptop, the 1st DVD makes so much noise, but the 2nd DVD is very quiet like my other movies.",1482192000,,761,4.248275862068965
