8324324,5,B000GGS0UK,"The smell of the split urad dal & rice fermenting is addictive and trying your hand at Dosa can be hysterically funny. Don't worry about the thickness of your dosa - super thin is the mark of a profesional dosa chef. Three types of vada are shown along with rasam & sambar which you see in chaat houses. I make idlis with a 3 tier idli maker which makes a little smaller than those in the demo, but again smells fermented which makes your mouth start watering. Just remember curry leaves are not related to curry powder so don't substitute. 14 recipes in all with the word doc having a color picture of each final dish plus text to help jog your memory when you are cooking. Another very good dvd from cookingondvd.",1194912000,3,715,4.383458646616542
