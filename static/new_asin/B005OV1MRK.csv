4855104,3,B005OV1MRK,"Richard Strauss's rarely performed penultimate opera here makes its commercial DVD debut.  The true star of this release is Strauss's seamless, rhapsodic score, thrillingly conducted by Andrew Litton with an assist from the sonics, heavily balanced in favor of the orchestra though never drowning out the soloists.  Of the 3 principals, Mark Delavan excels as the Wotanesque Jupiter, Matthias Klink's Midas is pleasant to look at & listen to, while Manuela Uhl, who was also the Danae in the opera's 1st commercial CD release (on cpo), is often troubled by a pronounced wobble, even more noticeable in this 2011 performance than on the CD set recorded in 2003.

But it's the staging that makes viewing this CD so disconcerting, the mythical characters in ugly modern dress, principals moving this way & that with no dramatic logic, pages of music score somehow representing both golden rain & a gold hair-clip, other objects referred to in the text but nowhere in sight &, above all (in every sense), an inverted piano inexplicably suspended over the stage throughout the opera (see box photo).  I kept waiting for it to come crashing down, a la the chandelier in Phantom of the Opera.  It didn't.

The ""bonus"" material consists of brief excerpts from a public rehearsal & narrated ""program notes"" that add nothing to the information contained in the printed booklet.  I'd hoped that among her comments, stage director Kirsten Harms would say something about the dangling piano.  She didn't, leaving both the piano, & me, dangling.",1322870400,25,1531,5.0476190476190474
8482052,4,B005OV1MRK,"Someone said the DVD was ""lyrically luscious, visually vacuous"". He should have came here to see the salzburg festivals premier of a new production. Let's get this out of the way:  overall, the DVD is better than what I saw here.  Here, visually, it was totally a la Las Vegas (if you've been there), dancing girls in golden spandex fooled around, rest of people on stage sported gigantic turbans.  When they didn't know what to do with the stage background, they made it a projection of constant flow of carpets, like a sample sale in an America furniture store. Danae was singing beautifully if composer specified vocal ranges happened to be right for her.  Midas was fat bold old man, a visual miscasting.  Jupiter sounded all right but not as good as the DVD.  The Most disappoint of the night was the conductor.  I like his reading on a few Richard Strauss operas, but not this one.  He made orchestra loud enough to overwhelm the singers frequently, and use the same tempo and loudness time and time again.  So you say to yourself there is a reason this opera is a rarity.",1470268800,,1078,4.572916666666667

8482054,4,B005OV1MRK,"This time at least, Strauss music is so beautiful and well sung that it trumps the horrid Eurotrash staging by Kirsten Harms (her last name can be taken literally).  The trio of principals and the supporting singers do extremely well, as does the conductor.  As for the upside piano, it is totally irrelevant.  I am glad I bought it.  With the right staging, it would be 5 stars.",1439164800,,379,4.529411764705882
8482055,3,B005OV1MRK,"I'm somewhat surprised to see so many 5-star ratings for one of the rather mediocre operas of Strauss, presented in a rather mediocre production! What ratings would those people propose for a top-notch Salome, or Rosenkavalier, or Frau Ohne Schatte, or the Capriccio in the Met? 10-stars?

The ""Danae"" is one of Strauss' last operas, composed after his good librettist, Hoffmanstahl, has already died. And there is a good reason why this ""Omnia Vincit Amor"" [Love Vins over Everything] type opera, with Greek-mythical characters, is seldom produced: it is not Strauss' best. Nevertheless, well produced and well sang, the Danae is well worth to see and hear, especially if you enjoy the ""sprechstimme"" style singing, which is written in most parts of the opera.

As I said, this opera requires good staging and singing. Visual effects are important here to follow the story, which assumes that the audience is quite familiar with the Greek myths. Those myths are not used in a straight way, but they represent the foils of the jokes and the references on the stage. You must be familiar with the stories of Semele, or Leda and Alkmene, otherwise the story makes no sense. An example for the staging problems: in the second scene Danae in her bed supposed to receive on her lips and breast the gold pieces falling from the sky, sent by Jupiter/Zeus. The production instead dumps music sheets from the ceiling, in an otherwise empty room, with a fire-extinguisher mounted on the wall, and a piano hanging above, upside down.

The singing is also not a first class affair. The lead soprano, Manuela Uhl, tries her best to outscream the Straussian orchestra of about 120 instruments in the pit. She, however, does not succede well, and the result is a quite irritating sounding soprano. It is difficult to sing ""sprechstimme"" anyway, even if one has a powerfull voice. The tenors are all right, though Matthias Klink often struggles.

These are just examples, indicating the mediocrity of the production. Nevertheless, if you are set to hear all of Strauss' fifteen operas, you must buy this one, since there is yet no other available. Still, this over rating of 5-stars everywhere seems like giving everybody ""A"" in the schools, or jumping up and applaud/scream in the operahaus after any production.",1377734400,5,2297,4.958441558441558
8482056,4,B005OV1MRK,"A new recording or performance of Die Liebe der Dana, the penultimate opera by Richard Strauss, is a rare thing. But thanks to curiosity and scholarship, recent years have been kinder to Strauss' ""cheerful mythology,"" a bittersweet comic tale of the god Jupiter (Mark Delavan) and his quest to bed the title character. This production, from the Deutschen Oper Berlin is staged by Kirsten Harms with a minimum of regie interference. Andrew Litton conducts this elaborate score.

Strauss worked on Dana during the Second World War, and the opera has some of his most inspired orchestral ideas and complex writing for his favorite instrument: the female voice. The title role is taken here by Manuela Uhl, who has made it something of a specialty. She brings powerful, mostly pleasing tone to the high-lying vocal line, although the vibrato widens when the voice is put under pressure The last scene, with some of Strauss' most demanding writing for the soprano, is sung with transcendent, ecstatic power and warmth.

The hardest part to cast in Dana is that of Midas, the donkey driver turned pretend-king. Tenor Matthias Klink impressed in the role, surmounting the heavy orchestration and reaching a dizzying height. The treacherous part is Act II, with two challenging, back-to-back duets. The first, a face-off with Jupiter, demands heroic singing from both men over a bellowing brass section. The second is the long love duet that ends in Dana's brief death.

Mr. Delavan is familiar to New Yorkers from the halyon days of the New York City Opera, is Jupiter. This is Strauss' version of Wagner's Wotan, all hubris in the early going, all regret in the last act. The angry passages are a little much for Mr. Delavan's voice, and he fights admirably against the orchestral clamor. But he brings warmth and resignation to the last scene, when Dana and Midas are settled in a humble hut, away from all that gold.

The large supporting cast is solid. A pair of character tenors:  Burkhard Ulrich and Thomas Blundelle do well here as the bankrupt King Pollux and Mercury, the gods' playful messenger. The four princesses (Semele, Alkmene, Leda and Europa) are past victims of Jupiter's advances, married off now to mortal princes. These parts are taken by an impressive quartet of singers, who look magnificent in white wigs.

Dana has the (justified) reputation of being a tough opera to stage. For starters,  the libretto describes Jupiter's entrance as a shower of golden coins. Here, that image takes the form of sheet music, dropped slowly from heaven like divine inspiration. The transformations caused by Midas' deadly golden touch are handled by Manfred Voss' skillful lighting. Why a piano hangs suspended above the stage for the entire opera is anyone's guess.",1325030400,6,2768,5.017429193899782
8482057,5,B005OV1MRK,"Richard Strauss did not write a lot of operas and, of those, the names most are familiar are ""Der Rosenkavalier"", ""Elektra"" and ""Salome.""  Yet, according to writings and notes from the time, he personally considered ""Der Liebe der Danae"" (The Love of Danae) his greatest. In fact, he had died but three years before its premiere in 1952. Some reasons ""Danae"" has not enjoyed a greater production life to date may  be its length (at just under three hours - although hardly the behemoth of operas) and it may be that the use of a fairly familiar Greek mythological tale of greed - as it existed in a bankrupt and corrupt state - interfering with true love and pure ethics was a bit much for post war Germany (and beyond). Regardless, this new production from the Berlin Opera is fun to watch and makes a compelling case for the revival of this lesser known masterpiece. Most are somewhat familiar with the basic tale of the God of gods, Jupiter, using his God of prosperity, Midas, to help Jupiter get the woman of his desire, Danae. Only when Jupiter discovers that Danae has not only discovered Jupiter's deceptions but has fallen in love with Midas does Jupiter put the famous curse on Midas whereby everything the latter touches turns to solid gold is - therefore - unattainable. In the end, Jupiter tests Danae's true devotions and Midas' allegiance by allowing Danae to choose and - in so doing - Midas and Dane become lovers, yet powerless and Jupiter becomes saddened and awakened to the reality that neither power nor gold will influence true love. The performances here are great. Manuela Uhl as Danae, Mark Delavan as Jupiter and Matthias Klink as Midas are all gifted singers as well as actors. The secondary roles, in a relatively small cast, are also quite good; most notably that of Thomas Blondelle as Mercury. The stage design and direction by Kirsten Harms is also arresting. Huge sections of palace wall provide a minimalist backdrop and - later - serve as the wreckage to the palace. Large paintings of unclear reference are toted off during the initial cast off of Pollux's wealth (whom Jupiter has gypped) as is his grand piano.  The piano, in fact, makes for the single most strange stage prop throughout. Take from Pollux during the 'liquidation' of the initial scene (by being hoisted from its normal position to then hang suspended from the stage upside down, lid ajar) it then serves as some sort of symbol for - perhaps - the fleeting attraction of material wealth. Art Haus does its usual fine job of artistic packaging, superb video quality and very helpful booklet information. It is also a welcome benefit to have an additional 22' of film interviews with Kirsten Harms and dramaturge Andreas K.W. Meyer. I recommend this to anyone wanting to explore wonderful yet lesser known opera in a familiar tonal world but with contemporary and visually stunning vision.",1324944000,6,2892,4.791583166332665
8482058,4,B005OV1MRK,"I am happy to have this opera because it is the only one.  But I am too old and senile to see the point (and expense incurred)  hanging the piano over the stage. Claiming it symbolizes something about art means that they probably do not realize that the real are involved in ths sining, music and appropriate stage and costumes - not some stupid attention grabber.  To me it would have been a much better opera in reasonable costumes and without the stupid piano.  But still enjoyed it.  I can see some excuse for eurotrashing an opera that has been seen thousands times and you think people are bored with it in its original form,  but not this one which has not been around.",1324166400,5,676,4.411290322580645
8482059,5,B005OV1MRK,"Die Liebe der Danae was completed by Strauss in 1940 and had five Librettists-Hofmannsthal,Zweig,Gregor,Krauss and himself. The offical first performance of the opera was at the 1952 Salzburg festival,three years after Strauss's death. Since then there have only been 20 performances. Possibly the libretto was seen as out of touch with the times. Also,Strauss stated about the opera"" that he sought not lyricism,not poetry,not sentimentality,but a theatre of reason,full of brains and dry wit""The music is mainly light in texture ,but in the last act Strauss regains the warmth and richness of his last works, Capriccio and the Last four songs,and throughout the opera, looks back at Daphne. Jupiters Renunciation stands alongside his most beautiful pieces he ever wrote.

This opera is right in tune with today. For example, Act one, Scene 1: The throne room of King Pollux. A state crisis:there is no money in the coffers. To soothe his creditors, King Pollux sends his four nephews to King Midas,in the hope of being able to interest Midas in a marriage with his daughter Danae. Throughout her trials Jupiter falls in love with her,but Danae decides against him and decides in favour of Midas, even when he is turned into a poor donkey driver. She herself is turned from a vain, self loving girl into a woman who bravely defies poverty and hardship. Even Jupiter is touched and becomes a fatherly friend and then leaves the world.

 The scenery is set in an undefined period and hung from the ceiling is an upturned piano which can symbolize that Art is as important as life itself. Also, that the period in which the opera is set is in chaos. This point is made clear when pages of the score drop upon Danae's head instead of gold. Andrew Litton conducts the orchestra  and Choir of the Deutsche Oper Berlin to bring out the emotion and long lines of the music. Jupiter is the major part in this opera, the first and only time it was not a woman. Mark Delavan catches the Strausian line beautifully as does Matthias Klink as Midas. Manuela Uhl sings well and is a beautiful looking young woman, but she has not a Strauss voice like Lucia Popp, Schwarzkopf,even  Anne Schwanewilms. I can recommend this opera to traditionalists,for there is unlikely to be another production of this opera for a long time. Dont miss this if you like Richard Strauss.

8482060,4,B005OV1MRK,"I partially agree in some points with the previous two reviewers. In a nutshell,this is not a bad DVD and perhaps the only one we're gonna come across of this forgotten opera by a long shot,that is in the commercial market,of course.
Granted,the production is silly,score sheets instead of gold rain,Midas in trenchcoat and shirt and so on. But basically regisseur Kristin Harms respected the main elements of Gregor's libretto and transported the action from mythological times to an undetermined timeframe. That doesn't bother me that much. Even the suspended piano represents for her the state in which art found itself in the time of the composer. This last detail is completely unnecessary,yet not quite frugal.

In terms of the singers: Regarding german soprano Manuela Uhl,I beg to disagree with the previous reviewer. She navigates through the tough role with easiness,and she seems to have learnt from having sung it for many years,i.e. the previous CPO
audio set where she also stars. Strong singing from american baritone Mark Delavan in the beautiful role of Jupiter.
Only tenor Matthias Klink sounds uneven. He does pretty good in the first two acts,specially singing the high C that culminates his duo with Danae in the second act. But in his arioso at the beginning of the third act he seems to crack and he
almost drowns two notes.

The only downside of this version is the stupid cut that was imposed in the last scene of the third act,a long duet for Danae and Jupiter of extreme melodic beauty,written by a composer who was saying farewell to this life and had the hope of meeting his dear close ones in a better world (verbatim). All this is wonderfully expressed also in the symphonic interlude that precedes the scene,which some people call STRAUSSENS ABSCHIED.
This cut was not necessary and I don't see what difference does it make for an institution like the DEUTSCHE OPER BERLIN.
They can afford it. And if the opera was only 10 minutes longer it would not have affected anyone who sat already for the
rest of it.

Bottomline,I give it 4 stars for the effort of bringing about this magnificent jewel,which many despise but which I love,like
all the operas of the wonderful bavarian master.

8482061,5,B005OV1MRK,"Never before released on DVD and scarcely ever performed (according to the notes on this release there have been only 16 productions worldwide in the last 60 years), the time it seems has never been right for the playful nature of Die Liebe der Danae's mythological subject.  Composed in 1940 but not premiered until 1952 after Strauss' death, it would appeared to have had even less relevance in the post-war years and in an world of German opera that was embracing the earthier, discordant sounds of Berg, Hindemith and Weill.  This wonderful 2011 production at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin certainly makes a persuasive case that the time is finally right for Strauss' neglected late masterwork.

The classical subject of the opera relates to another of Jupiter's mythological liaisons (one or two of his other conquests also appear in this opera), disguising himself as Midas in order to seduce Danae, the daughter of the bankrupt King Pollux of Eos.  Danae however, against the odds and her love of gold, rejects the disguised Jupiter and falls in love with the real Midas instead, unaware of who he really is.  It's a choice that is to have grave repercussions.  The mythological elements of the opera have some similarity to Die Walkre - the allure and the power of the Gods diminishing, the strength of human love that takes its place expressed in the union of Midas and Danae taking its place - and the score accordingly sees some of Strauss' most Wagnerian touches, certainly in Act II at least.  It's tempting to see, as the author of the booklet notes on this release points out, Strauss in the role of Jupiter, considering his position at this stage in his life and concerned about his legacy in a world that may no longer need him.

There is however it seems to me something of Strauss in Midas also, ""cursed"" with a gift that turns everything to gold - Die Liebe der Danae is scored as beautifully, extravagantly, lushly and with infinite levels complexity as some of the greatest of Strauss' works - but it's a gift that carries with it the danger of turning whatever it touches into something cold and lifeless.  Strauss would question the function of opera again in his final work Capriccio, and seems to have reached an accommodation that the underlying truth and life in his work will endure and still find a way to reach out and touch the human spirit.  It's taken a long time for recognition to be given to this particular opera, but perhaps the time is finally right.  All that glitters may not always be gold, but sometimes it is.

Die Liebe der Danae is pure gold, and so is this production, particularly for fans of Strauss.  Directed by Kirsten Harms, there is perhaps some attempt to make a personal identification of the opera's themes with the composer by hanging an upturned piano over the set in all three acts with falling pages of a music score instead of golden rain, but otherwise this is a relatively straightforward and faithful staging of the opera, set in a timeless mythological world that is neither period nor modern.  It looks marvellous and comes across well on the screen, the sets perfectly appropriate for the scale and the nature of the subject.  The casting is good and the singing excellent with Manuela Uhl as Danae, Mark Delavan as Jupiter and Matthias Klink as Midas.  The full splendour and luscious beauty of the score is superbly performed by the orchestra of the Deutsche Oper under Andrew Litton.  This is good as you could hope for from a live performance of this work.",1323216000,7,3527,4.7182410423452765
