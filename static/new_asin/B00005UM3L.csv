1665786,2,B00005UM3L,"Story line was good. Happy to see a young Richard Prior at his best, as well as the other African-American stars at their peak during this time. The quality of the picture wasn't that great, but you need this in your collection if you are a serious collector of ""Blackpotation"" movies. Enjoyed it never the less",1214265600,,311,4.571428571428571
1665787,5,B00005UM3L,"I am a Stephen Boyd fan.  Boyd did such a wonderful job acting the role of Masala in Benhur that I have tried to see all of his movies.

The strange thing about Black Brigade is that I purchased the movie because of Stephen Boyd, but I found the members of the Black Brigade team were equally inspiring.

This is a war movie.  There were 12 black men acting under the charge of this white Officer.  By the end of the movie, both the Officer and I were impressed by the characters the black men played.  They were all 5 star actors.  It was a good story played by a team of excellent actors.",1187222400,,590,4.12280701754386

Robert Hooks,Rosie Grier&Moses Gunn are also in this film. it's a interesting film as the Unit has only a couple of days to get into order.",1174521600,4,310,4.456140350877193
1665789,3,B00005UM3L,"(...)That alone is scary-- I knew it might stink, but with the cast list, I thought it might actually be OK, and it is. It's a HORRID DVD transfer though, but for 1 dollar I can't complain too much!

It's what I thought it was, a TV movie (originally aired on ABC) from 1969 written by TV mogul Aaron Spelling and Produced by the great Danny Thomas Productions, who produced such classic TV shows as The Dick Van Dyke Show, That Girl, The Andy Griffith Show, etc,.
 This film stars Stephen Boyd, a great character actor/leading man known for his roles in such movies as 'Ben Hur' and 'Fantatstic Voyage'.

It features young newcomers such as Richard Pryor and Billy Dee Williams & football star Rosie Grier in great supporting roles as members of an all-black WW II US Army company ('B' Company) in France who are doing the 'grunt' work of the Army. Digging latrines, digging graves, dealing with garbage, etc. Basically getting No Respect. Blacks were considered second class citizens during WW II.

The story shows how Racist Redneck Major Carter (Boyd) is asked to go on a dangerous mission to blow up a Dam held by the Nazis and the only company of men to help accomplish the task are 'B' Company, (the all black company).

They appear lazy and shiftless to Major Carter, who doesn't believe they can help him blow up the dam. Little does he know, they are more than up for the job. Carter asks their lieutenant in charge for 'volunteers', and he picks 6 men, including Pryor, Williams & Grier.

It's fairly standard TV movie fare, and it's kind of neat to see Pryor and Williams in early roles, as well as great black character actors Moses Gunn & Glynn Thurman (Cooley High)--as well as Susan Oliver, a great blonde character actress who appeared in lots of TV drama in the 60's on shows like 'Star Trek', 'Mannix', 'The Wild Wild West',etc.

 It's a nice forgotten addition to black cinema, and shows that black men in WWII could be just as heroic as their white brothers. It's an interesting look at race relations in the late 60's context too, what with the Black Panther movement and all.

It's kind of funny how all the black actors have big afros and a few have mustaches/goatees--not typical of WWII U.S.Army standards, but more like1969 fashion. Pryor sports a natty red beret throughout the whole story, too.

I guess I recommend it as a piece of nostalgia. Again, The DVD transfer is Horrid, but viewable.",1098921600,14,2421,4.609302325581395
1665790,4,B00005UM3L,"I was curious about this movie primarily to see the comedic and cinematic development of a young Richard Pryor(pre the Toy and Superman 3 debacles)...the movie in my opinion DOES stand the test of time considering that it was made 34 years ago.  There were some cool cameos(a young Paul Mooney in the background)and of course an ensemble cast of some heavy weight & familiar African american actors..i.e..Billy Dee Williams(starring in Brian's Song the following year), Moses Gunn, Rosie Grier, Glynn Turman and Robert Hooks(a superb actor and father of noted actor/director Kevin Hooks).  Surprisingly, the movie holds up..an example of this is the reference to the Moses Gunn character being a physics teacher from Howard University who joined the war effort thus surprising the racist Stephen Boyd  character for being a learned Black man.  My main gripe is the transfer...yes..this was a Aaron Spelling made for tv movie but if the movie was remastered it would have been a hell of a lot more enjoyable to watch...but again...it WAS worth a gander to see some familiar actors during their prime.....it's worth a look.",1089417600,9,1121,5.076086956521739
1665791,2,B00005UM3L,Aron Spelling this was not one of your better writing scripts production Danny Thomas must of been sleeping on the job he had much better work out their  Some thing was lacking it per trade the racism of the time. It made the men look stupid and lazy were in fact they may of felt tired of being left behind from the fighting and just tired of the same ole s*** they must of faced every day of their back home. I liked the part were they stepped up in the end and got the job done but yet still abused bye the White soldiers. So true. I know every one was not that way even in WW2. The movie lacked Drama but being written in the 60s may be for TV it could of been a rush job it was good to see the new comers just starting out learning their craft. I enjoyed seeing them from the 60s again. It could of been Directed better may be it was just the budget they had to work with.,1472947200,,877,3.899441340782123

This production was directed at all audiences in America with many limitations it seems.  It includes an all star cast of young and famous black men that helped paved a way for up and coming next generation actors in Hollywood..  I salute all the actors during that time, living and dead, for their courage to compete with all the difficulties they had to face to carve out a carrier back then.",1445385600,,590,4.547169811320755

1665840,3,B00005UM3L,"Great cast from the 1969 movie that aired on TV! It does portray the lack of respect for black soldiers but offers the comic relief of Richard Pryor's character. New to the big screen at this time, he is easily recognizable and so is Rosie Grier. Certainly not a great storyline or cinematology. Kinda sad, kinda funny and a just kinda sort of movie. This was an Amazon recommendation . . . military history documentaries and I suppose they thought I need some comic relief (  ;

Recommended? Yes, for those who appreciate this genre. 'Kinda sorta' means 2, 3, or 4 star so you add 2 + 4 = 6 and then divide by 2 = 3 and that's your answer. I enjoyed the humor in the character portrayals!

The script was poor, and there were places of incontinuity throughout.  I thought that if any actor stood out it was Billy D. Williams.  His facial expressions, and attitude said a lot about the time when a black squadron was little more than a clean up crew.  The movie was not on par with The Tuskeegee Airman or Memphis Bell.  I guess, I was looking for another ""Glory"".  It made the point, and introduced some young up and coming actors.  We must not forget John Amos or Rosie Greer.
