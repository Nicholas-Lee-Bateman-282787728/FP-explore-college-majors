2169871,1,B000667GJQ,"It is no wonder that parents in our society are struggling to gain respect and be able to control their children.  We worry that movies and games they play are appropriate and make claims that there are terrible things being watched out there.  But right here in front of us is a movie we should feel safe watching and all it is showing our children is that it is okay to disrespect their father.  Besides, according to the movie, Dad's just don't get it anyways.",1107302400,3,463,4.423529411764706
2169872,4,B000667GJQ,"We bought and added this movie to the other ten our kids have(yep, they have the whole series for now!!).  My kids are six and seven.  They watch these movies more often than they do the disney movies which line their walls and movie cases.  It teaches the importance of telling the truth no matter how much it may hurt and not telling even the smallest lie because lies like to grow and mess everything up.  I'm just wondering, will there be another???????",1107216000,,457,4.469879518072289
2169873,1,B000667GJQ,"The series suck.  It's only good for kids, but older audience will be pissed to sit and watch the whole thing.  Disney movies are better to watch with your kids.  I enjoy watching Disney movies even teenager.  At least the adults can enjoy the movie too.",1106006400,2,254,4.456521739130435
2169874,4,B000667GJQ,We just bought this movie today and it's one of the best Land Before Time Videos.  I like how they introduce the beginning by saying that even the little things matter and then of course the movie goes on to show why even the littlest dinosaurs mean something.  Very cute!,1105401600,10,272,4.42
2169875,3,B000667GJQ,"First of all i just turned 14 and i used to watch these movies a LONG time ago. But i would buy it for a young child tho. I think these movies suck now but hey im not going to rate it bad because its a childrens movie. Personally i like action, comedy horror movies. But this movie is an OK film but i would recommend for a young child only",1101772800,3,340,3.8028169014084505
2169876,5,B000667GJQ,"The land before time movie's are great. My children 13 and 2 both love the movies, they have 1-10. They just can't wait for number 11 to come out especially my 13-year-old. You won't regret buying this, for first time buyers buy volume 1 see how they like it then 2,3,4 e.t.c . Trusts me you won't regret it if a 13-year-old will like it so will your child. Trusts me this movie will be awesome. try it you must by this ,you will only know if you like it if yu buy it, honestly.",1100217600,11,478,4.042105263157895
2169877,5,B000667GJQ,"Our daughter is 22 months old and absolutely LOVES this movie! We don't own any of the others in the series, but will be picking them up one at a time soon I'm sure. I didn't expect her to enjoy dinosaurs at her age (I thought she might even be afraid of them), but she has requested this movie every day since we first played it two weeks ago. She enjoys the songs and focuses on the action all the way through. One of her favorite parts is toward the end when a couple of meat-eating dinos show up and threaten the main characters.  She sees the bad guys and exclaims ""Teeth!"" and cheers when they are eventually chased off. Hard to say how this movie will hold up as she gets older, but for now, it's definitely a favorite!

Trivia: It was an interesting surprise to find out that the grandfather in this film is voiced by Kenneth Mars, the Inspector from ""Young Frankenstein"".  I kept waiting for him to shout ""To the lumberyard!"" Apparently, he's in most of the movies in this series.",1099267200,9,989,4.335135135135135
2169878,1,B000667GJQ,ok this is getting to be real annoying all they do is keep doing this dumb series and won't stop i saw the first one and never wanted to see it again ha if your kid wants it you should not get it because they will stop liking it in a year or so and you spent all that money for nothing! the person who created it just brain washes kids to get this movie and make there parents buy it so parents do not buy this.,1098748800,,411,3.735632183908046

Invasion of the Tinysauruses is entertaining like  'The Borrowers' because of the tiny long-necks befriending Little-foot.

2169944,5,B000667GJQ,"I have read some of the other reviews stating this movie is ""bad"" on dads. I think this movie just shows that anyone of any age can be wrong about people. The dad of the tinysauruses does not like the ""bigger"" dinos saying they are trouble and to stay away from them. Turns out the ""bigger"" dinos are more then willing to help out the little ones. In this movie the dad learns something new.  I think it shows kids that you are never too old to learn new things and no matter what your age, you should never judge others.",1329004800,,521,4.158415841584159

2169950,4,B000667GJQ,"The movie has two basic plots to it: Littlefoot telling a little lie that ends up being a huge problem and cera having to learn to share her father with his old girlfriend.  The time to eat a new sweet flower is upon the Great Valley and everyone is ready for a taste of the flowers.  Littlefoot looking to sneak the first taste knocks down all the flowers off the tree where the Tinysauruses eat all the flowers.  Instead of telling the truth,  Littlefoot says the tinysauruses ate all the flowers (which they did...but wouldn't have if not for him knocking the flowers down) and leads to what some of the other reviewers complain about.  All the adults get mad and forms groups to hunt down and chase off the innocent Tinysauruses.  This does show what can happen in the real world when people are confronted with beings they don't understand.  The one problem I did have with it was near the end when Cera's dad looked like he was so close to trampling the two main Tinysauruses.  Thankfully everything works out in the end.  Cera does find the strength to make an attempt to like her dad's girlfriend (which is good because she is a more permanent part of the crowd unlike the other friends that the gang meets each movie to only say goodbye...she is in movie twelve and the television series after all).  At first, Cera gets too agressive about the name Tria calls Mr. Threehorn (Topsy) even going to the point of ramming Ducky up into a tree.  I think that was a little too far because while Cera was always a stubborn one she never before would hurt any of her friends.",1178582400,4,1576,4.456445993031359

2169952,2,B000667GJQ,"We own all the Land Before Time videos, and I was disappointed in this one. Although the tiny dinosaurs are cute (and so is Cera's dad's girlfriend), the characters are either mean-spirited, dumb or ineffectual. Littlefoot and Cera are shown to be spiteful, Cera's dad is a raging, lying bully and Grampa has regressed from being a wise elder to being a weak and ignored character. The plot: Littlefoot feels inadequate for being short so he tries to eat the tree blossoms that Cera's dad guards fiercely. The tiny dinos come and eat what Littlefoot knocks down, Littlefoot lies to protect himself and Cera's dad organizes a posse to hunt and kill the little ones. The songs include references to eliminating others, how bad dads are, and other choice themes I'd rather not sing aloud with my 5 year old son. This is by far the worst of the lot.",1131321600,21,845,4.64
2169953,5,B000667GJQ,This is another great entry in the Land Before Time series.  SAFE FOR ALL CHILDREN.. NO ADULT INNUENDO!  I would reccomend it as a gift as well.,1122940800,4,144,4.296296296296297
2169954,3,B000667GJQ,"I have to admit, I was a little disappointed on how the way this movie turned out. I expected a little more ""flare and care"" then this. Don't get me wrong, it's not a horrible film.....but it's not great either.

The plot is this:

Littlefoot discovers a new species of dinosaur known as the Tinysaurus. (Heh. Take a guess at how they thought up the name...) Though they may seem cute, these little longnecks are also hungry....and Great Valley foods are on the menu for them. Naturally, Cera's father leads a protest against them, and the grown-ups of the valley make it their job to get rid of the pests. Littlefoot however, sees a good side to these guys, as he accidently stumbles upon them one day and finds out how nice they really are.

On the other side of the valley, Cera is having problems of her own. Her dad has been paying more attention to his girlfriend then to her (Cera). This leads to some anger management problems, as you can probably figure out.

The songs? Umm.....they're ok..I guess. True, they don't teach very good ""lessons"", which stinks. However, they have a really good beat to them. I surprised even myself when I started dancing to the music....

In a nutshell, this movie is good...but not great. Yes, the main plot is to bash all fathers of their evil intentions, with a sub-plot stating that ""a little lie can cause big problems"". However, it's up to you to decide if the kids will like it or not. It's pumped enough air into the tires that little toddlers might enjoy it, but hasn't put enough flavor in the lollypop to enthusiasticate the older kids. Just my opinion. Enjoy the movie at any rate.",1119139200,12,1633,4.540816326530612
2169955,2,B000667GJQ,"After watching this movie, my 4 year started singing dads are dumb, dads are dumb- because that's all she could remember of the song. Sometimes pre-schoolers don't ""get"" the entire message of a song or movie.

2169956,1,B000667GJQ,"Horrible.  Buffoonish, hateful, xenophobic dad attempts to engage his cruel, disrespectful and mean daughter who treats her friends like crap.  Need I go on?  How did we get from ""Mom and Dad are always there"" to Dads are stupid and clueless but we tolerate them...I guess.  Did the Land Before Time people trot out their C-team for this one?
