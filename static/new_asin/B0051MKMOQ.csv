8452923,2,B0051MKMOQ,"Tempted by the product's hyperbolic self-accolade, I ordered it without hesitation, and it turned out to be a rip-off. The picture quality and the video direction (2002!) are extremely poor, amateurish at best ('a professional video and audio team'!). The performance itself is average: a lethargic orchestra, a disinterested chorus of mostly old and worn-out singers, and soloists who are not truly Handelian and whose English intonation is mediocre (when a soprano cracks on a note in 'I know that my Redeemer liveth', the embarrassment should be saved using a voice-over, which isn't the case here: 'who cares?' the DVD's team must have thought). There are (in addition to the dal segno version of 'The trumpet shall sound') many cuts: I'm not sure why 'Let all the angels' and its recitative, 'Thou art gone up on high', 'How beautiful are the feet', 'Their sound is gone out', and 'O death' and its recitative were deleted, but 'He trusted in God' and its recitative, as well as 'Why do the nations', were deleted almost certainly because of these passages' alleged anti-Judaic undertones (as Marissen argues, rather unconvincingly, in _Tainted Glory_), the result being that 'Thy rebuke' and 'Let us break their bonds' make no sense at all in context. Despite some moments of fine singing (e.g., 'Ev'ry valley' and 'If Go be for us'), I don't recommend this recording.",1438819200,4,1374,5.030701754385965
