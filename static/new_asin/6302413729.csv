460179,4,6302413729,"Amityville-It's About Time is a fun movie for horror fans. The Amityville Horror is back again, this time encompassed in an antique clock with a sinister history. I don't know why, but I found this movie unintentionally hilarious, the father of the family gets bit by a dog and slowly goes mad-as the result of his proximity to the ""cursed"" clock of course!  The teen daughter turns seductive-also a victim of the clock's doings. The neighborhood psychic is the only one who seems like she can help...I liked this movie a lot, but I am perplexed by the ending. What exactly happened there? I don't want to give things away so I won't say more, but it is rather confusing.",978825600,6,671,4.591666666666667
460180,5,6302413729,"The movie is just great. It has great characters. One that played a real big role was Rusty (Damon Martin). Just think of it, an antique clock from Amityville that turns good into PURE EVIL. When the clock hits a certain time at night, strange things happen. From seeing a different room at the flip of a switch, to seeing a dead guy come out of the bathtub faucet. It all comes down when Rusty goes into a friend's house and sees the same clock in a different house from Amityville. Then Rusty is captured by police. The ex-wife sees a model of the neighborhood and it comes all down to a simple point, everybody in the house...must die. I can't tell you anymore cause it would spoil the story.",978652800,2,695,4.3538461538461535
460181,4,6302413729,"It's about time! After what seems like an unending period of mediocre sequels, the Amityville franchise produces a film on par with the gruesome original. Once again a family comes into contact with an evil clock. If  you're looking for originality, this won't be a treat. If you simply want  to enjoy another movie based on the formula, you've hit pay dirt. This film  isn't perhaps as scary as the original, but it does contain a bathroom  scene that gives ""Psycho"" a run for its money. The actors  themselves are unknowns, but turn in decent performances enhanced by the  best character development yet in the series. At times the movie seems too  bizare with far flung events such as the papa's dog bite which causes him  to fester at home until he becomes possessed by evil. Despite this, the  film never loses momentum. The pace builds steadily until the fairly  exciting climax with the inevitable showdown with the ingenue and the evil  clock. While it may not be the best horror film, it is hands down the best  Amityville.",962150400,4,1032,4.70391061452514
460182,3,6302413729,"WELL THIS ONE WAS A LOT BETTER THAN 1,AND2. THIS ONE WAS MORE SCARIER AND HAD A BETTER STORYLINE TO IT. STILL NOT THE BEST HORROR MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN BUT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD. I GIVE ***",946944000,,187,3.8205128205128207
460183,2,6302413729,"Could all those horrible movies be blamed on the simplicity of a mere clock? Head of the family brings home clock that possess father and daughter and kills anyone who tries to stop it. One of the best in the  series at times just tries too hard to hold our interests firm, even  dressing down a few cast members. Not much potential any way you look at  it.",945475200,2,357,4.220588235294118
460184,2,6302413729,"Fifth instalment of the Amityville series and  quite easily the worst of the series. The acting is what caught my eye most of all- poor, unconvincing unknowns were just, it seemed taken off the street with  someone prompting the script to them through the film. The effects, I  expected would have been a little more improved since Amityville's  predecessors but they still had a very cheap look about them. On the  positive side this film is watchable, but overall, all we are seeing is a  repeat of the famous, eerie Amityville house we have seen in the last four  films.",945043200,,573,4.67

7825408,3,6302413729,"The video on this copy was distorted, the color was severely off and the sound was muffled.  For some reason the spanish subtitles were  stuck on.  It was basically unplayable, but it was also an old VHS and I can't be too mad about it.  The whole movie turned out to be available on youtube so my friends and I still got to watch it and enjoy.  It's a silly movie with some ludicrously ridiculous moments and we had a great time watching it.",1421539200,,442,4.214285714285714
7825409,5,6302413729,"I found the storyline of this movie to be very interesting, in regards to the haunted clock from Amityville that basically attaches itself to a new house. Very well done!",1362441600,,170,4.7
7825410,4,6302413729,"What a suspensful flick this was! The story is interesting and quite complex. I have noticed that a lot of films kind of branch-off into different sub-plots, but this film doesn't, it has a main story. That makes it easy to follow. The characters were beleivable and that really adds to the horror. I must take away one star, simply because this film was a little to gross than it needed to be. For example, what was the disgusting and un-necessary deal with that guy who was ""sinking"" into the floor?",1059350400,3,501,4.516483516483516
7825411,4,6302413729,"This is probably the second best AMITYVILLE film.  It has a good plot, good acting, good directing and it's creepy.  It does have a very good story, I must say.  It's definately a story that's too good for a diret-to-video sequel.  If you liked the first film, check this one out.",1059350400,2,280,4.431372549019608
7825412,2,6302413729,"Everything goes wrong in this 6th (Yes, 6th) installment of the ""Amityville Horror"" series. Bad script, acting... no suspense & average special effects. An Unsuspecting suburban family buys a mantel clock (guess what... it's possessed) and then awful/dumb things start to happen. The opening sequence is gripping, but the movie starts going downhills after that.
Skip It.",1022284800,,371,5.526315789473684
7825413,3,6302413729,"A clock possessed with some of the evil from the cursed house in Amityville wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting family.  This low budget thriller manages to mix some surprisingly entertaining moments in with the expected hokem.  Recommended to bad b-movie buffs, those wanting a quality ghost yarn should look elsewhere.",996624000,3,316,5.3
