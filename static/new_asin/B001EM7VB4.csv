8298849,1,B001EM7VB4,"A kind of sex education that turns intoa consultation with a gynecologist. Very few excinting ! Moreover, it is not even Annie Sprinkle the patient. A goddess of sex ? a sad joke !!!",1424131200,,182,4.382352941176471

8298852,5,B001EM7VB4,"This video changed my life when I was a young woman eager to discover my sexuality while a graduate student at the University of California, Riverside.  It helped me see sex and erotic pleasure from and entirely new perspective.  I began to imagine how one could learn to be a good lover the way one learns to be a good painter: by practicing, practicing, practicing.  I've done that and the result is a very happy life.  In my wisdom years I've had the joy and privilege of meeting and working with Annie Sprinkle.  She had inspired my work as well.  Thank you, Annie Sprinkle, you are my hero.",1384041600,4,595,4.462962962962963
8298853,3,B001EM7VB4,"This video is somewhat dated visually, but has some good tips for those looking to expand their definition of sex and orgasm. Unfortunately there is some weird high pitched music on and off throughout the movie that detracts from the video. I would suggest this video is you are looking for something different from mainstream adult films and enjoy a variety of female body types. Main feature is only about 45 minutes. There is also a bonus video of zen meditations on the female anatomy that I have seen sold separately as its own video.",1249516800,2,539,4.684210526315789
