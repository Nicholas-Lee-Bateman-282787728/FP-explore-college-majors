2529271,3,B000EQ5PPA,"If you have been collecting the seasonal sets 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 like me, then you will want to pass on this.

First a quick word about these later seasons:
SEASON 4 - only 19 new half hour shows were produced. The rest of the season was filled out with re-runs.
SEASON 5 - NO new half hour shows were produced. BUT 66 new 3.5 minute Rocky & Bullwinkle segments were produced to be inserted into older shows, replacing the older Rocky & Bullwinkle segments. Thus 33 half hour shows were created for the 5th season re-using the secondary cartoons from previous seasons.

Each of the three stories starts out with one opening title section from season 2, a brief Rocky & Bullwinkle intro. And then the story chapters, uncut but with out the individual intros. Midway through we break for a Bullwinkle Fan Club or Bullwinkle's Corner segment, then back to the story. At the end of each completed story is a set of end credits based on the second season credits, but copyrighted 1997.

The episodes:
POTTSYLVANIA CREEPER - 6 chapters from season 5. Influenced by the cult classic film LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, Boris sells Bullwinkle a huge plant that eats people.

MOOSYLVANIA - 4 chapters from season 5. Influenced by Jay Ward's purchase of a small island that he called ""Moosylvania"". In this first part, Moosylvania is located in the Pacific Ocean, near California.  Rocky & Bullwinkle try to find Washington D.C. to declare state-hood for their island.  Boris & Natasha make a fake Washington D.C. to confuse them.

MOOSYLVANIA SAVED - 4 chapters from season 5. This final Rocky & Bullwinkle story is the only sequal produced, although characters from previous stories would re-appear in other stories.  Strangely within the same year as the first part of this story, the island of Moosylvania has now moved to the great lakes inbetween Canada and the U.S., where Jay's real island was. Canada & The U.S. argue that the island belongs to the other country while R&B request aid for their failing island.

There is no bonus material other than a forgettable brief collage of clips showing Boris in various disguises.  This disc runs only 60 minutes and should have had twice the material, especially since stories 2 & 3 are more like one long story.

Order season 5 here:

This was a wonderful Jay Ward collection and well worth the price. I bought it used on Amazon. The humor on this DVD is not just for kids it is a real enjoyable laugh for adults too. I miss the style of Jay Ward cartoons. His production style was pure genius. This is a great addition to my other Rocky and Bullwinkle collection.",1423353600,,477,4.085106382978723
