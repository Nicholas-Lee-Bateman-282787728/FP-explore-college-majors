5657434,5,B00BNAE6M4,"Teri Polo is one of my favorite actors, and this is one of the better movies in which I've seen her.  The story of two competing restaurant owners (one with a daughter), is funny as well as leaving me feeling great.",1370822400,4,215,4.2439024390243905

5657436,5,B00BNAE6M4,"I seen bits and pieces of this movie on the Hallmark channel and I was very interested now that I purchased it, and watched it; I found I liked the movie very much.  It was everything I expected Hallmark to offer.  Good family entertainment.",1370390400,17,241,4.454545454545454
5657437,5,B00BNAE6M4,"Had I mesmerizing powers, I would right now look you in the eyeball and compel you to watch this movie. Later, you can thank me for it. Pardon me a moment as I ransack the attic for my watch on a fob. It swings fine and with hypnotic purpose.

It's another Hallmark Channel joint, so it's very much of the family friendly persuasion. I feel it's one of the best films to air on that network; that's how much I enjoyed it. Don't let the standard romantic plot dishearten you. Take in instead the expert execution of that same standard plot, and the across-the-board chemistry of an engaged cast, and the movie's big heart.

Here's what's on the menu: Sara Westbrook (Teri Polo) is a classically trained chef, fancy head chef's uniform and perfect posture and very uptight. In Central Valley (wherever that is), she runs Chez Varenne, a restaurant specializing in exquisite French cuisine. Sara is a food psychic, so good at her job she can detect all the ingredients in any dish you care to place before her (I've the same preternatural skill, but it only works if you place a Reese's Pieces before me). Chez Varenne is underperforming. It boasts an underwhelming clientele; it's barely turning a profit. Sara is more uptight than ever. She's desperately wracking her brain.

It's hard to wrack your brain when the place next door is blasting rock & roll noises. Sara's new work neighbor is Gill Callahan (James Patrick Stuart), widower and retired fireman and now fledgling restaurateur. Gill just opened the Five Alarm Grill, an eatery that trots out barbecued comfort food. Sara welcomes Gill by busting in and asking him to turn down the music. Gill refuses. And, just like that, the birth of a feud and the onslaught of pranks from both parties. Here's another bitter pill for Sara, that the Five Alarm Grill attracts such robust business, never mind that Gill tends to make up his recipes as he goes along.

There's no arguing that Polo and Stuart draw up sparks together. The conflict between their characters arises not only from their natural professional competitiveness - Sara's precise, artful presentation versus Gill's messy, improvised dishes. Other things are in play. There's Sara's creeping demoralization as her hard work still results in her restaurant's flirting with insolvency. There's Gill's inertia rooted in his reluctance to move on even though his wife's been gone for two years. Teri Polo is really, really good in this movie. She's tough and brittle and appealingly vulnerable and, when given opportunity, so funny. What she does in that stream-of-consciousness babble meltdown in her kitchen (you'll know the scene) is priceless stuff. It reduced me to big smiles.

Okay, Sara at one end, Gill at the other, and it seems an unnegotiable impasse. But here's the bridge. 9-year-old Hannah (Bailee Madison) is obssessed with many things French, ever since her mom years ago promised her a trip to France. It's not a stretch that Hannah would approach Sara for French lessons in language and in cooking. Sara, for her part, immediately takes to Hannah. She doesn't know yet that Hannah is Gill's daughter. If she hadn't yet enchanted you as young Snow White (Once Upon A Time) or as an enterprising girl scout (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smart-Cookies/dp/B009INABXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smart Cookies</a>), Bailee Madison's Hannah should do the trick. Bailee is a captivating find. She doesn't try to get away with just reciting her lines and looking cute. She acts the hell out of this movie. Her composure amazes me, more so because it's not at the cost of a child's natural exuberance. But even Hannah needs a little help orchestrating a love connection for her dad. Thank goodness for those ruined crab cakes. They provide the opening move in a detente between two warring chefs. I'll stop right here. So, A Taste of Romance. Don't lollygag, you romantic fool. See it. Buy it. Or buy it, then see it. Whatever. I'm swinging my watch with the fob. You are getting sleepy...",1370217600,43,4051,5.0044510385756675
5657438,5,B00BNAE6M4,I was amazed that a film with such a simple plot could be so charming.  The story is very engaging and the dialogue is well crafted.  So many films seem these days to be produced on an assembly line with little quality control.  Just get another teenage mentality film out.  This film is truly fun to watch and reminds me of the film Return to Me.,1369267200,49,347,4.212121212121212

If this was a play, I would have been fine with the cheesy looking sets. But cheesy in a movie takes away from the ""real"" feel to see streets with no curbs, no difference between sidewalk and inside the restaurant, with house siding on industrial buildings, etc. etc.  The best acting was done by the little girl who could cry in all the right places, even though the adults couldn't squeeze out a tear.

Even worse, they are instantly successful with good basic food while the hoity-toity restaurant flounders.  Chef Sara (Teri Polo) of Chez Varenne tries to be neighborly by imperiously demanding they turn down their music.  Pranks ensue and sob stories abound.  The cook at the Five Alarm Grill (James Patrick Stuart as ex-fire fighter Gill) lost his wife to cancer and then quit working as a fire fighter when he almost died in a conflagration.  Naturally, Chef Sara could and would top that by announcing that both her parents are dead!  So there!  Of course they date, pushed at each other by his manipulative daughter Hannah (Bailee Madison).  Will they find true romance or will a snooty food critic (Charles Shaughnessy as Redman Rove) muck things up.

Cute, albeit predictable, with a foregone conclusion.  The story would have worked better without the artificial sweetener (Bailee Madison).  Otherwise, not bad.",1453593600,,1008,5.122699386503068

Led by handsome former fire fighter Gil Callahan (James Patrick Stuart) and his friend Danny (Rockmond Dunbar), The Five Alarm Grill is soon a big success while Sara and Patsy (Romy Rosemont), her pastry chef, struggle to bring in customers.

Sara suddenly softens when she meets Gill's 10-year-old daughter Hannah (Bailee Madison) who she can't help but take under her wing when she learns Hannah is growing up without a mom. Ignoring the obvious tension between her dad and Sara, Hannah is soon playing matchmaker.

As Gil and Sara slowly begin to stir up romance, their relationship is tested once again when a local food critic gets in the mix. Can the couple resist the temptation to compete with each other, or will the heat of competition drive them apart?",1391731200,,959,4.835365853658536

Sometimes they're not, and that makes it difficult to watch. Call me superficial, I don't mind. Teri Polo is a real movie star, not just a made-for-tv movie star, so that is a plus. The little girl is from ""Just Go With It"" and she's not as annoying when she's not doing all those fake accents. She does try to speak French a lot in this movie, but it fits in with the plot.

My husband and I liked the storyline of a chef attempting to get her new business off the ground and discovering her heart needed attention as well.  The father and daughter relationship was the type every little girl dreams of with her father...a dad who includes you in his life and is there to pamper you when you are injured and to hold you when you cry. The supporting role of friends in this movie adds to it as well. We thoroughly enjoyed it and added it to our library to keep from fast forwarding through the commercials on the DVR.,1386633600,,619,4.2905982905982905

5657818,5,B00BNAE6M4,"We are fans of Teri Polo for starters, and we really enjoyed the match with James Patrick Stuart (a newcomer to us).  But we absolutely fell in love with Bailee Madison.  It was Hannah (Bailee) who started the competition ball rolling between Sara and Gill, when she told Sara about how the firemen ""goof around and play tricks on each other at the fire hall.""  With some firemen's tales in our family, that made the competition in the story extremely real for us.",1373760000,2,464,4.566265060240964

5657820,4,B00BNAE6M4,"This is a pretty standard TV movie with a pretty standard romantic comedy plot. It is the story of how a French chef who owns a fancy but struggling restaurant learns to deal with a widowed dad and former fireman who opens up the ""Five Alarm Grill"" next door. At first there is a lot friction between them, but over time, they warm to each other. Most of the characters in this movie are likable and fairly realistic. They do a good job with their roles. There is nothing terribly original about the plot, but at the same time, there is also nothing outlandish or unrealistic. This is simply a nice, clean love story. It is one of the better TV movies I have seen and I recommend it for a nice low-key evening of watching.",1373587200,13,722,4.3161764705882355

5657832,4,B00BNAE6M4,"I like a lot of the movies on the Hallmark channel, but unfortunately many of them don't get a DVD release. So I was happy when this one came out to buy. Sweet, romantic movie about a retired fireman named Gill who opens a casual eatery complete with loud music right next door to a sophisticated French restaurant run by Sara. It's definitely not love at first sight for these two as one tries to out do the other but Sara does bond with Gill's young daughter Hannah, who tries to set up her single dad with her new friend.
Very entertaining movie with some romance and comedy that the whole family can watch.  I recommend this one to own.",1373241600,,640,4.333333333333333

5657839,5,B00BNAE6M4,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). A Taste of Romance was really, really clean.  There is mild language, a couple scenes of drinking wine, a discussion regarding a roof almost falling on fireman and a discussion about losing a mother to cancer and losing parent in an accident due to a drunk driver.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"". The Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for all ages.

Gill is a single father raising a young daughter.  After having a close call while being a fireman, he decides to quit and start a restaurant with some of his co-workers.  Sara has her own French restaurant right next door.  Gill's is an overnight success, while Sara struggles on a daily basis to make enough money to cover expenses.  They are at ""war"" at the beginning.  Sara, not like the firefighter's loud music and non-gourmet food, and Gill who tries to welcome her ""creatively"" to the neighborhood.  Hanna, Gill's young daughter, immediately lover Sara, who will talk French with her (reminding her of her mom) and will teach her the art of French cooking.  Hannah tries to get them together and little by little Gill and Sara comes to love each other.

While of course it is a formula romance, every character is actually likable!  It avoided the anger and childishness of ""damaged"" people as usually portrayed by Hollywood.  And the best part, the little girl is adorable and not a brat....another change from the usual. A darling, light chick flick that I would recommend to anybody.
