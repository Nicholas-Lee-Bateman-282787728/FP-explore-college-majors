Back in the 80s I used to watch a programme called ""Der Experimentelle Film"" (the experimental movie) or something like that a lot on our local TV station. (the WDR - West German Broadcast)

It would present a lot of fascinatingly weird works, like a film from Russia that combined weird imagery (think Tsarkowsky's ""Stalker"", only even more so) with creepy atonal music and old tape recordings of people rambling on about world conspiracies that were made in a Soviet insane asylum...

""Summer..."" invokes the spirit of these kinds of movies. It's cinematography (I do believe the word is justified even if it's shot digital), the music, the ramblings of the kid...

All comes across just as weird, maybe even disturbing as I remember the previously described Russian movie to be. The monologues of the lonely, disturbed child make me think of the classic French cinema of Truffaut and Goddart or the feeling of bleak loneliness that is oozing out Bergmann's oeuvre.

But with a puppet.

Is it a parody? Or a serious movie? Or something in between perhaps? It's hard to say, but I surely DID enjoy watching it, grinning like an idiot a lot. So that's got to be worth something, I guess...",1305849600,,1218,4.776190476190476

I loved his last movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Only-Interstellar-Pinball-Lives-Forever/dp/B003U4VGII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Only Interstellar Pinball Lives Forever</a>&nbsp;but it took me a couple of views to really get into it.  I saw this and wondered, is it a sequel?  It looked like a separate movie but using the same characters.  Turns out it's a new movie, not a sequel, but a different, darker take on the same strange relationship between a lonely guy and the childhood puppet that haunts him.  Unlike the last one, which was about weird ideas of living forever through pinball technology, this one is mostly an adult comedy about the crazy world of childhood boredom.  It would be hard to explain how the movie is much more than just that idea.  It's another trip through 1001 weird ideas with cool music and more puppet sights you'll find hard to forget.",1304726400,2,967,5.449664429530201
