8710383,4,B00VKFQ1CA,The 2014 edition of the TNA PPV Sacrifice was a solid show. Opening match the Wolves vs the BroMans 3 on 2 no dq tag team title match. Hard fought excellent opener. Samuel Shaw vs Mr Anderson. Winner must put their opponent in a padded wagon. Fun match. Ethan Carter 3 and Rockstar Spud vs Kurt Angle and Willow. Average match at best. Sad as all 4 guys are great wrestlers. TNA X-Division championship match Sanada vs Tigre Uno phenominal match. James Storm vs Gunner. Sick I Quit match. Knockouts championship match. Madison Rayne vs Angelina Love history making women's match. TNA World Heavyweight championship match. Eric Young vs Magnus. Underrated match as both guys worked their butts off.

8710385,3,B00VKFQ1CA,"The Tag Team Championship Handicap NO DQ Match: Champions the Bro-Mans and DJ Zema Ion vs. The Wolves (Richards and Edwards) was a good and fast paced opener and the title change came at the right time. The Committed Match: Mr. Anderson vs. Samuel Shaw was not great but pretty good. The Willow and Kurt Angle vs. Ethan Carter III and Spud tag team match was a confusing match, lots of stalling, no good . The X Division Championship Match: Champion Sanada vs. Tigre Uno was a bit sloppy and disconnected at times. The lack of crowd involvement also hurt it. The I-Quit Match: James Storm vs. Gunner was good work from both, including violence and blood that many wanted, but it lacked the crowd reaction/investment that their Lockdown match had, which is unfortunate. In front of a different crowd, its a different match. The Knockouts Championship Match: Champion Madison Rayne vs. Angelina Love was short with a stupid finish to boot. The Bobby Roode vs. Bully Ray-Tables Match was a nothing match with a horrible, flat finish that was so unneeded. The Eric Young vs. Magnus-TNA World Championship match was a good, solid bout without the normal TNA Stuff. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1429488000,,1190,4.698564593301436
8710386,3,B00VKFQ1CA,"This show is decent, but not the best. TNA has had great events, but this one was just ok and one of the biggest reasons was the crowd. There have been so many TNA shows done in Orlando at the Impact Zone so the crowd was dead at times where the show was awesome. The Tag Team Title match and the I Quit match were both great matches, with the rest of the matches on the show being pretty decent, even the Tables match was pretty good, and for anyone wondering the hilarious referee bump is on the DVD in all of its unedited glory. There's no extras.

Not bad, but not the greatest TNA show in 2014. I'd recommend Lockdown 2014 & Slammiversary 2014.",1429401600,,649,4.192

8710388,3,B00VKFQ1CA,"No Disqualification Match: Tag Team Champions BroMans & DJ Zema Ion vs. The Wolves - The BroMans had to finally defend their championship against The Wolves with Davey & Eddie taking control over all three early on with various double team offense along with using one opponent against the other on more than one occasion while The BroMans to resort to desperation allowing them to single out one member such as using the ringside environment & illegal tactics that didn't always work in their favor.

Committed Match: Mr. Anderson vs. Samuel Shaw - This is under the same rules as an Ambulance/Last Ride Match where the only way to win is to put your opponent in the back of the vehicle which is this case was a van to an asylum.  Shaw kept avoiding Anderson & even attempted to use Christy Hemme as a shield but Anderson was able to stay one step ahead working over Shaw before Shaw was able to get the advantage back working over Anderson including his judo choke out but kept his focus on Christy at ringside allowing Anderson to fight him all the way from the ring to backstage including the interview area with various weapons being used from the guardrail to a chair.

Kurt Angle & Willow vs. Ethan Carter III & Rockstar Spud - Both Ethan & Spud where so threatened by Angle that each man kept tagging each other in just to avoid him & argued over which one would get in the ring before we see Willow did something straight out of ""Mary Poppins"" from the top rope & worked over both men in the ring before Ethan was finally able to ground Willow working over his upper body & later finally working over Angle's bad leg while Angle heavily relied on his suplexes including one that heavily tossed one man across the ring & Willow being able to use his opponents against each other.

X Division Champion Senada vs. Tigre Uno - This was the final match in their Best Of Three series as both men had stalemates early on before Senada went aerial with a head scissors takeover to the outside & tumbleweed cradle while Uno stayed grounded with a knockout kick followed by a head scissor & armbar submission combination as both men traded momentum exchanging aerial moves such as a springboard dropkick, twisting flip dive, double under hook tiger suplex, catching his opponent in mid-air with a dropkick, and moonsault.  This was a good match with both men having a very similar style to each other.

""I Quit"" Match: Gunner vs. James Storm - This was also set to be the final match in their trilogy (Last Man Standing & No DQ/No Count Out) that started out with both men trading fist against each other with the action getting taken to the outside early with the ringside environment coming into play before settling back into the ring where Storm heavily worked over the throat as various weapons were introduced into the match including both men exchanging shots to the head with trash can lids as things got more violent including a hanging DDT into the steps & more shots to the head using chairs & other weapons while also using the referee to their advantage to the point where there was bleeding followed by one hell of superplex with an impactful landing & an ending that gave me flashbacks to around 3 decades ago.  This was no different than their previous two encounters in that this was a physical impactful war.

Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne vs. Angelina Love - Madison started out in control with a series of armdrags sending Angelina to the outside followed by a baseball slide to outside but Angelina was able to regain control using the ropes to her advantage along with going to the outside whenever Madison started to gain control only for Madison to take it the outside as they traded momentum with Velvet Sky getting involved from the outside whenever possible.  This match served it's purpose as far as re-establishing The Beautiful People but was just average at best as they never left first gear.

Tables Match: Bully Ray vs. Bobby Roode - Bully took control early in the match before Roode was able to catch Bully off guard & keep his advantage whenever Bully took his attention off him to set up various tables as both men were able to keep blocking each other's attempts at putting them through the table including delivering some hard hits to each other like strong chops to the chest, a spinebuster, neckbreaker from the top rope or one man putting his opponent through the table that the referee didn't see with it all coming down to not just who got put through the table but who was the person that did it.  This was one of those matches where the stipulation hurt more than it helped as we know that both men were capable of having a much stronger match than what we got but the match was just a background to pushing the storyline revolving around someone else who was effected by what happened LockDown more than anything else.

TNA Champion Eric Young vs. Magnus - This was the rematch from earlier in the month when Young won the TNA Championship as Young kept outsmarting Magnus with mind games such as taunting & making fun of him allowing him to take control & keep catching him in a side headlock takeover only for Magnus to finally catch Young on the outside delivering impactful moves such as a power slam & lariat while trying to keep Young grounded including working him over with a camel clutch submission as they traded momentum with both men executing the same offensive maneuvers against each other or having the same strategy of going for a submission win.  While this match on paper was lacking the star power expected for the PPV main event, this was a very solid main event match between both men made better because it was a CLEAN finish instead of the usual interference or heavily overbooked endings that TNA has had for over a year when it came to their championship matches.

TNA made the decision to stop doing live month to month PPV's (in favor of the One Night Only specials) around a year ago with one of the main reasons being that it gives the bigger shows more time to be built up & become a more special event with this PPV being the first one since that decision to happen a month after a previous live PPV event showcasing why it was a good decision to stop the back to back live events because this overall came off like a three hour edition of Impact where many of the matches felt like they were thrown together last minute or only on here to further a storyline.",1428019200,,6441,4.555747623163353
