5114946,5,B007Z1XERI,"This is a definite for the ultimate Laker fan.  This team had quite the Hall of Fame line up.  Though they were up in age, they put it all together and did it.",1399248000,,159,3.787878787878788
5114947,5,B007Z1XERI,the video quality is excellent for such old footage. Chick Hearns voice accompanies each highlight and lowlight in this video and identifies that Chick was as much a Laker as any of the players. I would recommend this disc to anyone who wants to know what it really means to be a Laker fan.,1374451200,3,290,4.388888888888889

5114950,5,B007Z1XERI,"With the Miami coming on strong, good to remind people of how good this Laker team was.  The best team of all time for one year!  33 in a row/69-13 and the Championship.",1364256000,2,169,4.090909090909091
5114951,5,B007Z1XERI,"Born in 1958, I never saw a televised game of my hero Jerry West and the awesome Lakers. This 1972 Championship season DVD is just wonderful. So great to see the old clips, the streak, etc.

5114952,5,B007Z1XERI,"Great old footage, and great interviews (mostly with Wilt, Jerry, Bill Sharman and Gail Goodrich) of the 71-72 team.  Surprisingly gives a good background as to the Lakers move to LA and the heartache the team endured year in and year out coming up just short of a title courtesy of the Celtics reign.  Makes it even more interesting to note just how this team achieved such a level of greatness that year, when most people figured that their best days were behind them.  Only complaint is that I would've liked to seen more material devoted to Happy Hairston and Jim MacMillan (as they were vital cogs to the teams success that year), but nevertheless a great vid.  Extras include interviews with Pat Riley, Bill Walton and Tommy Hawkins, and all are very entertaining and insightful.

Even if you are not a huge Lakers fan, if you were a fan of the NBA like I was in the late 60's and throughout the 70's, buy it.  You will not be disappointed on this one.",1360108800,7,958,4.477011494252873
5114953,5,B007Z1XERI,"To go back in time and watch those legends play was great to see. You go throught a litle history of Lakers failing to win and then you get to know the best players and then you just go throught the season with them and finish as champions.
West, Wilt and Gail wining and the sad part og Elgin Baylor not on the team.",1348531200,,317,3.96875

I think I'm going to buy this for my collection.",1419292800,,285,3.982456140350877

Highly recommend to Lakers fans and retro NBA basketball enthusiasts.",1404259200,2,252,4.555555555555555
