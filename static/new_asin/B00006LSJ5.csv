7971970,5,B00006LSJ5,"I was introduced to 'Still Game' and 'Chewin' the Fat' by my Scottish husband and to say it's hilarious is an understatement.

You could say it's like ""Grumpy Old Men"" set in Glasgow, but that wouldn't do this series justice. Greg Hemphill (""Victor"") and Ford Kiernan (""Jack"") are decades younger than the men they portray but they do it with such empathy it's hard to belive they are NOT senior citizens.

You MUST get this first disc and be introduced to ""Jack"" and ""Victor"" and the rest of the Craiglang Gang. Scottish humor IS different from the English humor we've been getting for decades.

We should all be lucky to be as popular in our neighborhoods as these two old men in our twilight years.",1143676800,2,701,4.592
