8278722,5,B001AQO40K,"It is currently 2013, and this was, and still is, my favorite tv show. I was upset back then that it didn't make it past Season 1, but now, I'm just glad that I'm able to watch the whole series (16 eps) with a satisfactory ending, and no forever cliffhanger.

8278724,5,B001AQO40K,"I taped the 16 episodes of Moonlight that we were lucky enough to have, bought the DVD at Amazon as soon as it came out, and I can harldy wait to get the Blu-ray version.

I have been a fan of the vampire genre my whole life, and Moonlight is the very best that I have ever seen or read.  The cast ensemble alone is amazing.  Alex O'Loughlin is brilliant as Mick St. John, a vampire who was turned against his will 85 years ago, and is now a PI - trying to use his powers to help people and to make up for some of the things he did in his early years as a vampire.  Jason Dohring's portrayal of Josef Kostan  is classic. Josef is a 402 year old vampire - very rich and powerful in the business world, and Mick's best friend and mentor. Some of the most enjoyable dialogue is between Mick and Josef.  Sophia Myles is delightful as Beth, an internet reporter and Mick's human love interest, and Shannyn Sossaman is outstanding as Mick's ex and the vampire who turned him on their wedding night in 1952.  The show is filled with wonderful and memorable characters, vampire and human, and I am still hoping for another season.  Well, no - MANY more seasons.  For the first time since I was a child I had a show to watch that allowed me to escape for one hour a week, and what a wonderful hour it was.

Moonlight changes the standard ""rules"" of vampire tales.  It is very modern and makes you feel like vampires could actually exist - maybe right-next door.  I love the changes - vampires can be in the sun, but the longer they are in the sun, the worse they feel, and they would eventually die.  They are not bothered by the standard crucifixes, holy water and garlic - all of this is neatly explained by Mick in the beginning of the first episode - and these and the rest of the changes take you into a very modern and exciting world of vampires that you just don't want to leave.  You will end up wishing that they did live right next-door.

Moonlight has something for everyone, even if you are not a fan of the vampire genre.  It has drama, romance, suspense - and the writing is excellent.  One of the things I love the most about the show is the witty and intelligent dialogue.  The banter between Mick and Josef alone is delightfully funny and often very moving as well.

Moonlight is slick, sexy and brilliantly unique.  Most of all it is downright fun.  Buy the DVD for yourself - and one for each of your family and friends.  You will love it and they will love you for it.",1233964800,,2479,4.240938166311301
8278725,5,B001AQO40K,"Prepare to fall in love all over again with the sexiest, charming and charismatic vampire ever on television. Moonlight DVD set is a must have, it has romance, crime, action, vengeance, betrayal and best of all, vampires. Alex O'Loughlin as Mick St. John in the TV series Moonlight is terrific. I already bought the DVD and now I can't wait for the Blu ray version!",1233792000,3,365,4.630769230769231
8278726,4,B001AQO40K,"""Moonlight"" begins with a laid-back vampire PI being interviewed in his mind, defining what about vampires is legend and what is real. ""I don't hunt innocents. But there's predators out there that need to be dealt with.""

It's a quirky reversal of Anne Rice tradition, and it sets the tone for a very unique blend of vampire tale and urban mystery -- and sadly it ended too soon. Especially since Alex O'Loughlin is an absolutely inspired vampire detective, and the quick direction, good CGI and snappy writing save this from being another cheesy vampire story.

Mick St. John (O'Laughlin) is a vampire detective in L.A. -- where there has recently been a vampiresque murder of a college student. But though the student was obsessed with vampires, Mick soon realizes that she wasn't murdered by one. And with the assistance of Beth Turner (Sophia Myles) -- who insists he looks familiar -- Mick uncovers a weird little vampire-obsessed cabal at Hearst college, and a professor whose infatuation with undeath goes beyond mere fanaticism.

And there are plenty of other nasty cases -- an ex-con gunning for the vampire detective, a forced stay in the desert, ""Black Crystal,"" a feral newbie vampire, a hooker-killing teenage vampire, a supposedly-dead cult killer, a killer gang going after Beth's boyfriend, a Hollywood starlet, an attempt to kill Mick's mentor, and a vampire who threatens to ""out"" every single vampire in L.A.

But no vampire story is complete without the nasty pasts and romantic tension -- Beth discovers Mick's true nature, and finds herself drawn to him until she's hit by a terrible personal tragedy. And Mick is confronted by a woman who looks suspiciously like Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon) -- his dead ex-wife, and the woman who made him a vampire.

Most vampire stories, whether on TV or in movies, are so abysmally cheesy that you could slice them up and serve them with wine and crackers. Fortunately ""Moonlight"" succeeds in being quite a bit better -- not a lot of vampiric superpowers (beyond enhanced senses and healing), fangs and glowing eyes. The writers even poke fun at some of the old cliches (""Garlic... is good on pizza"").

The weakest part of ""Moonlight"" is the crimes themselves -- most are fairly ordinary murder mysteries. But the series does succeed in balancing out the vampire stuff with the private eye plots, and as the series winds on and becomes far more complex, the vampiric element becomes more essential to every story. Quick swooping camerawork, fast-moving plots, some nice nasty action.

And these vampires are done with tongue in cheek, whether it's their un-cliche living conditions (sleek minimalist apartments and mansions) or their easy use of modern technology (""If I hadn't become a vampire I would have missed out on the Internet, TIVO, World of Warcraft and GPS"").

That slightly offbeat style is helped by the dialogue (""Can you fly?"" ""Just like Superman."" "" Really?"" ""No.... it would be pretty cool, wouldn't it?""). For the record, the best lines are all from Josef (""Well, the blood lust can be pretty heavy when you're first turned. And you could really lose it. I know I did. Damn, those were good times!"").

Alex O'Loughlin is excellent as a vampire PI haunted by his past and his vampiric nature (""monsters don't get happily ever after""), but handling it with a wry sense of humor, brains, and enhanced senses. He even goes through some ups-and-downs that most fictional vampires don't, such as temporarily becoming sort-of-human, but fortunately O'Laughlin keeps him from becoming emo.

Myles is pretty decent as the pretty reporter who begins to wonder if a human and a vampire can find love, and Sossamon is brilliant as the mysterious Coraline. And Jason Dohring absolutely steals the show as the witty, happily amoral Josef (""She's delicious. '82 was a good year""), who nevertheless has his own sad past.

""Moonlight"" manages to avoid the cheeze factor, and this all-too-brief series succeeds in being a unique blend of vampire love story and murder mystery. Definitely worth seeing.",1233705600,10,4060,5.008902077151335
8278727,5,B001AQO40K,"People's Choice award-winning series!  Not sure why CBS was clueless about its potential but never has immortality seemed more attractive.  If you have any imagination at all, this is a touchingly believable adult angle, tempered by high drama, incredibly amusing male interaction, and enough romance to keep us gals sighing and hungry for more.....",1233619200,7,349,5.444444444444445
