4464108,4,B004SO26RE,"As I write this in September 2011 and summer is coming to a close, the 2009 documentary VANISHNG OF THE BEES makes me realize I have not seen many bees throughout the season.  Come to think of it, the past few summers I've encountered relatively few bees.

The way VANISHING OF THE BEES explains the situation, bees are not avoiding just me.  What the film deems Colony Collapse Disorder results in beekeepers discovering their honeybees literally disappearing.  VANISHING OF THE BEES reminds us honeybees pollinate enough crops to be responsible for ""one out of every three bites of food on our tables,"" so this is not just nature taking its course.

So, why are the bees buzzing off?  Because agribusiness, pushing pesticides and farming monocultures, fails to heed the Chiffon warning, ""It's not nice to fool Mother Nature.""  In the name of cutting costs, the food industry unwittingly undermines itself by killing off irreplaceable honeybees.

See VANISHING OF THE BEES.",1315094400,24,974,5.04375
4464109,5,B004SO26RE,"This is not the easiest theme but important to learn about it.  A large percentage of our food security hinges upon solving this mystery.  The root causes are not that mysterious though, wide use of pesticides is wrecking havoc all over the world.",1312243200,6,247,4.72093023255814
4464110,1,B004SO26RE,"I realy hate these apocalyptic films....They take one case and expand it to disaster proportions....There are still plenty of bees. And bees that polinate all of our crops....Mason bees, Squash bees, leaf cutter bees, Bumble bees, miner bees....all native be to north America. Why do we not see this?  It is because they don't produce Honey..However, the native bees are 10 -100 times better polinators than the honey bees (which were introduced into North Amreica in he 1600's)..why do we not care.. becuase wild native bees cannot be manipulated by breeders like the honey bee.  This is the reason were are having problems with honey bees. Not to mention the africanized problem, again caused by breeders, a while ago.

This is a sappy and stuipd analysis of a problem that we created but, that will not destory the world.",1311033600,14,824,4.913669064748201
4464111,4,B004SO26RE,"Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict-- In late 2006, bees in North America started disappearing. This startling new trend (dubbed by scientists as Colony Collapse Disorder) generated a wide variety of conspiracy theories about the root cause of the disappearances--perhaps cell phones were to blame, or maybe it had something to do with the forthcoming apocalypse--but scientists were unable to effectively pin down the culprit responsible. The 2009 documentary Vanishing of the Bees isn't any more successful in terms of finding the official cause, but it does provide a reasonably compelling suggestion and mostly manages to avoid the absurd hyperbole that has surrounded the Great American Bee Debate.

In fact, so much of Vanishing of the Bees is so reasonable that it's a little startling when the film tosses us a fleeting curveball (as it does every 10-15 minutes).

Given some of the doomsday conversation that has surrounded this topic, Vanishing of the Bees does an admirable job of staying away from the kind of sensationalist rhetoric that has fueled so many magazine articles on the subject (which usually begin by quoting Albert Einstein and end by proclaiming that we'll all be dead soon if we don't figure this out by yesterday). Perhaps recognizing that it's taking enough license with its slightly-overconfident pesticide proclamations, the documentary otherwise chooses to focus on the effects CCD has on beekeepers and crops.

The DVD transfer is sturdy if unremarkable, faring the best when it focuses on its striking collection of farmland imagery. There are quite a few talking heads, along with some animated slides that look kind of crummy (along those lines, the pieces of archival footage employed look rougher than they ought to, also). Audio is clear and clean throughout, dominated by interviews with a host of bee farmers, scientists and activists, plus narration courtesy of Ellen Page (whose high-pitched, emotionally involved intonations are a pleasant contrast to the usual sort of booming gravitas that often accompanies this sort of thing). Extras include ""Honeybee Rescue"" (a piece on how to correctly remove a bee colony from your land), ""Beekeeping in France"" (a piece about beekeeping in France) and ""Colony Collapse Disorder"" (an animated short outlining the specifics of the disorder). The disc is housed in environmentally-friendly (I guess?) but super-flimsy packaging, as the disc sits on a thin plush dot stuck inside an alarmingly thin piece of cardboard. This thing is going to get beat up after a few years no matter how carefully you store it. Ah well, the apocalypse will claim us all pretty soon, anyway.

4464112,5,B004SO26RE,"Small creatures are giving us a BIG warning.

You may have heard about the honeybee ""issue"" across the news media over the last few years and not have given it too much thought. You maybe unknowingly helping in destroying food as we know it by the choices you make at the supermarket.

Vanishing of the Bees shows you this global problem in a wonderfully directed, shot and paced film, that I recommend everyone watch right away! The film shows all the heart, dedication and passion of the beekeepers that are on the front line of this issue. You will care about what is going on, what needs to be done and how you and your family can help. What more can you ask for in a documentary?

Yet another reason to change our food system.

If films like Food, Inc., Earthlings and Forks Over Knives or books like John Robbins: The Food Revolution, Micheal Pollens: In Defense of Food and Thomas Campbells: The China Study have not changed the way you and your family consume the food you eat 3 times a day then Vanishing of the Bees maybee your opportunity we need for change.",1307923200,23,1069,4.466666666666667

These seeds are developed with a cell of a poisonous substance inserted into the formula which becomes part of the seed DNA.  The plant reject insects and the fields do not have to be sprayed.  However, the plants still bloom and bees visit the flowers proving disastrous for the bees.  And, now Monarch butterflies are dying off and are also being linked to the GE seeds.

Even worse, the accumulative effects of humans consuming the crops is proving devastating over time leading to cancer.  In one South American country where soybeans have been grown for over 10 years with GE seeds, many cases of cancer and birth defects are showing up where these cases used to be rare.

This, like any other natural anomaly could very well be a natural cycle, just like global warming and cooling is a natural cycle.  I do agree that certain pesticides are having a negative impact on humans and probably bees, there is some evidence for that, but not conclusive.  If the bees disappearing were truly man caused, then why do countries that ban pesticides, or just don't use them, still have the same problem?  In addition, honey bees aren't even native to north America! (http://www.agriculture.purdue.edu/agcom/newscolumns/archives/OSL/1999/November/111199OSL.html).  Stop the fear mongering and start researching for yourselves!  We (United States) are not going to die out if bees go away.  If so, we would have died out centuries ago before we brought the honey bee over to the Americas!

4464191,5,B004SO26RE,"This film is an amazing look at the genesis of colony collapse disorder (CCD) from the perspectives of the beekeepers who first sounded the alarm. It also provides a sobering look at the challenges of doing anything about CCD in our current corporate-controlled system, and how the burden of proof lies with the bees and those who tend them. Michael Pollan and others in the film illustrate how mono-culture and our industrial food system practices are once again proving devastating to life in general.

For years, beekeepers (such as myself) have argued over the cause of CCD. This film suggests that we may all be right: CCD is just another symptom -like Varroa, Nosema, and all the other viruses, bacteria and pests; our bees are increasingly unable to fight disease because their immune systems are weakened year after year from our nearsighted farming (and beekeeping) practices.

It's moving and sad, but also inspired me to go out and be a better backyard beekeeper! It makes me grateful that one hive out of three in my apiary has survived this winter.",1391472000,,1061,4.888888888888889

4464208,5,B004SO26RE,"Mysterious omens emerge that challenge scientists to interpret their meanings.  One appeared in 2006 with the bewildering disappearance of honeybees.  That bees suddenly vanished might not have shocked the layperson, but to beekeepers and agriculturists dependent on honeybees for pollination of crops, this news was catastrophic. For the public it could mean lack of produce in the food stores. Through the eyes of bee keepers, insect specialists and food researchers, this DVD production traces the detecting sequences employed to try to explain this global bee disaster.  Finding that no virus or fungus was responsible for this calamity termed Colony Collapse Disorder, and ruling out an alien infection, scientists began looking at agricultural practices.  With the development of massive field monocultures that require pesticide spraying, suspicion arose that the systemic chemicals used might be the responsible factor.  Hypotheses suggested that these insecticides in combination produced a deleterious effect on the insects immune system or brain formation.  In response to farmers demand, the French agriculture commission banned systemic pesticide use on corn and sunflowers, and as a result, the bee population rebounded there within a year.  There are consequences for every action, changes from sustainable farming to conglomerate monocultures with the concomitant need for pesticide spraying has already harmed frogs, bats, birds, fish and now it appears to affect the insect that is needed to help produce the food that feeds the world.  There is a clear message in this film, we are the custodians of this world and if foolishly that mission is abused, there will be consequences.

4464236,4,B004SO26RE,"It seems a lot of people around me know of the 'Collapsed Colony Disorder' so I'm late to the party, but, after seeing this documentary, all I can say is ""better late than never.""

Here's the scoop. Honeybee keepers in various parts of the world were discovering that their bees were dying off in catastrophic numbers. This documentary focuses on two prominent bee keepers (one in Pennsylvania and the other in Florida) and their efforts to determine why this is happening and what to do about it. The results are surprising.

I was flabbergasted by this. First, that I was unaware it was even an issue, but secondly, how vastly important honeybees are to the ecosystem. I like the way this film was laid out. They address the problem, the research, the findings and prospectus, but it's interspersed with honeybee facts, history and observations by leading historical figures. The sad thing is that it's an old song. New farming methods and uses of newer pesticides seem to be at the root of the matter. Fewer and fewer American farmers are growing fruits and vegetables. They are, instead, heavy into grains, so there is less and less for the bees to do. They take you to France who is also in crisis with their bees and point a real strong finger at Bayer and their ""Gaucho"" pesticide which they have now banned. Their bee population bounced back in about a year.

It's seems so simple. Get back to more diversified farming and quit using nasty chemicals for pest control. How many times do we need to hear this?! We need to take a look at Mother Earth and listen to her. I like that they promote homes doing their own fruit and vegetable gardening. It will help keep the bees around and healthy.

4464242,1,B004SO26RE,"""Vanishing of the Bees"" by Hive Mentality Films, 87 min., some parts narrated by Helen Page;  2010.

 This is a ""soft"" documentary that could be good if edited down to 60 minutes to remove the non-science propaganda.  The highlight of the film is the way it personally follows the effect of colony collapse disorder (CCD) on the lives of two passionate beekeepers, David Hackenberg and David Mendes.  I have always found beekeepers to be unique gentleman farmers and they certainly represent their industry well. However, their story line is broken up too many times. The asides to bonafide researchers to explain the valid science are appropriate. The equal coverage of fringe and non-science political groups may add to the political setting but heavily detracts from this as a valid video for classroom use. Fortunately, its length will require a teacher to show it in chunks and this allows the opportunity to skip the New Age-like portions.

 The beginning is weak, using an old black-and-white teaching film (you have seen this mocked on ""The Simpsons"") and an uneven montage of commentators and science explainers. Teachers can start the video with Hackenberg's 2006 testimony on his discovery of CCD; the ""60 Minutes"" segment is excerpted, some animation describes bee foraging, and CCD syndrome and the mysterious disappearance of the bees are well-presented. Today, bee-keepers cannot make a living just on honey and this shows excellent footage of how the hives are loaded onto semi-trailers and driven across country from Florida to the almond orchards of California that desperately must have bees. David Mendes enters at this point to note that CCD is not just a bee problem but an indicator of environmental degradation. CCD causes Rick Smith of Arizona to go out of business and this is an appropriate human side to show for students.  Dennis van Engelsdorp of Penn State describes the dilemma as it developed in that state.  Teachers can then skip over the New Age-like history of bees as omens, the female as goddess, and Earth as mother which is neither science nor history.

 Concepts continue: harvesting of wild honeycomb in high trees in Malaysia at night; scientists sample bees, suggest symptoms indicate they are immune-compromised bees; research into viruses, bacteria, fungus, etc. indicates these are not the single cause. Briefly mentions false leads (including new cell phone towers). Michael Pollan discusses the Australian bee imports; as a teacher, I would only use this segment if you know the fuller story (can be found in ""Fruitless Fall"" by Rowan Jacobsen). Shows the application of powdered sugar and antibiotics-doesn't help. Notes how small operations do not cause the stress of cross-country truck hauling, but then meanders into ""holistic beekeeping"" with Gunther Hauk in Illinois keeping far fewer bees. [Again, ""Fruitless Fall"" discusses how this means living in near poverty.] Discusses ""mistreatment"" of the queen in re-queening but shows excellent footage of artificial insemination by sperm of 18 drones in the lab, that is considered additional mistreatment [uses the slang ""knocked up""]. Condemns use of sugar syrup. One commentator proposes that over generations, this diet causes inheritance of weak traits, an inheritance-of-acquired characteristics argument.

 Dee Lusby promotes organic beekeeping as an alternative (no sugar syrup or artificial pollen or insecticides) and contends the natural consequences of industrial beekeeping result in ""going down the road to hell""--although she understands the economic forces that drive the larger operators.

 Then we enter a ten minute segment that bashes China, Argentina and the customs inspectors.  A teacher will have to decide whether their class is focused on science (leave this out) or social studies.  The challenge from China is cheap honey [China is our major source for bonafide quality honey and royal jelly, etc.) but this portrays foreign honey as always watered down, or labeled as honey blend, called ""funny honey."" This unhappiness with current tariff controls and inspection is more protectionism than CCD, and solutions in this area are political-legal.

 The largest cases of CCD are shown at this point and the scenes of massive empty hives are staggering. Then Michael Pollan describes how monocultures require pesticides, and that is solid ecology. But the next scenes linking pesticide development to German gas warfare in the World War II are egregious. This over-the-top condemnation rolls on to use a broad brush to indict DDT showing another black and white ad that showed it being sprayed to prevent polio. While that rationale was wrong, DDT did prevent massive deaths during World War II from louse-borne typhus, deaths that in World War I were greater than the munitions-caused casualties: and DDT was a valid and effective control of malaria and was only problematic when used outdoors for crops and could enter the food chain. This type of superficial ideology dramatically drops the credibility of this section of the video that should be left out science classes. [Teachers who wish to know the science on DDT need to read ""Malaria Capers"" by Robert Desowitz.]

 A good place to begin the video again is with Mendes explaining why earlier pesticides were not a problem, but how the new pesticides are systemic; general effects are described. Short term research shows they are benign on bees. Maryann Frazier of Penn State finds the new systemic pesticides in tissues, but are these small non-lethal doses causing long term effects? Next scenes show the Washington DC hearings and Mendes' suspicion that this is the cause based on anecdotal evidence.

 The video now shifts to France and its 10-year earlier use of the systemic pesticides developed by Bayer; emergence of their ""mad bee disease"" and footage of bees on sunflowers with and without the pesticides. Footage shows bees weak and falling off, very impressive to an audience, but this is not science. French beekeepers protest and the French impose a systemic pesticide ban on corn and sunflowers. Mendes and Hackenberg attend the French ""17th National Conference of Apiculture"" where beekeepers are certain it is the systemic pesticides. Since there is a six month lag between application and CCD, this cause and effect is hard to prove. [They do not mention that the areas of pesticide use and CCD do not always correspond, see ""Fruitless Fall"" for more details.  The European union has placed a moratorium on use of these neonicotinoids as of 2013, well after this video was made, as a ""watch and see"" action.] British beekeepers protest. Italy joins French ban.

 Throughout the video, book pages turn between scenes and give various witty quotes out of their original contexts. Unfortunately, and Einstein quote is used to ""dis"" science. The French cautionary approach is contrasted with the EPA regulations that require risk assessment based on ""reasonable risk."" This is the U.S. situation [but the ire directed here at EPA should go towards lawmakers]. The fact that the manufacturers are to provide the research is considered the ""fox guarding the henhouse"" which again reveals the slant of this whole video.

  Solid entomologist Marla Spivak discusses accumulated harm over time and synergistic effects. Jay Feldman charges the EPA with ineffectiveness. Beekeeper Mendes however wisely explains how ""time will tell"" which is actually one of the most scientific statements in the program. In contrast, Michael Pollan asserts with certainty that ""exactly what is responsible"" is monoculture.
Without any details or other rationale, fears of GM crops are hyped and Feldman and Pollan assert that non-chemical systems can be just as productive. Feldman continues, making unsupported claims about autism, learning disorders, etc.

 The Natural Resources Defense Council suit against the EPA over systemics is described. The French beekeepers claim a ""bounce-back"" within one year when insecticides are banned (contradicted by the scenes in this video, but this is never mentioned). The last ten minutes move into a predictable environmentalist conclusion: celebrates organic beekeeping and highlights city bees in NY and San Francisco, portrays CCD in popular media and dance, and briefly provides suggestions for the common citizen.

 Three ""special features"" come with the DVD: ""Honeybee Rescue"" shows transfer of a wild colony from a playhouse (40 seconds); ""Honeybees in France"" shows more history of hives (good for classes) and hives on the roof of the Paris Opera House (3 minutes); and an ""Animated Short Story"" is a silent video, a demonization of urbanization with the bee as an indicator of our demise (2.5 minutes).

 This program could have been edited down to focus on beekeepers Hackenberg and Mendes and the science and made a good 5-Star 40-minute objective documentary. In its present 87 minute-format, it is unlikely to fit into classroom schedules and would need substantial teacher oversight.",1371513600,29,9017,5.281818181818182
4464243,2,B004SO26RE,Very disappointed in this documentary.  I purchased it hoping it would tell me why bees are dying.  The dying bees are causing the price of honey to go way up.  This documentary did not provide any concrete information as to why bees are dying by the thousands.  Basically all it did was interview farmers who stated they were having a difficult time economically because their bees were dying.  I ended up sending this documentary to one of our local colleges.  Maybe it will in some way prove of some value to the students there.,1367280000,2,531,4.595744680851064

4464246,5,B004SO26RE,"When we found a honeybee hive in our garden a year ago, my husband's first instinct was to kill the bees and remove the hive. I'd heard about the sad story of honeybee decline, so before we did anything to the bees we started learning more about them and all that they do for us.

We are now beginning beekeepers, due in large part to the information that is so well presented in this film. The decline in honeybee population in the United States, and worldwide, is more serious than just the loss of some insects. Once we understood more about just how important and amazing these creatures are, we wanted to do our part to protect them.

Beautiful, informative, and incredibly touching, this film will inspire viewers to feel compassion for the honeybee and hopefully inspire more discussion about just what we can do to protect them.",1364515200,3,836,4.641891891891892

4464253,5,B004SO26RE,"I have been interested in bees for some time (have a love/hate relationship with them, as I have a phobia of them).  Even so, I started watching this documentary assuming that it would be kind of dull.  It was anything but--I lost track of time while watching, which is a first.  Without giving things away, I was grateful to get insight into why migratory beekeepers would drive their hives all over the country, year after year--hint: it's not honey.  Having read Following the Bloom several years ago, I have always had a soft spot for beekeepers, and the warmth that people in this film exuded towards their apiary friends was touching.  Probably the best part about The Vanishing of the Bees is the sense that there is a solution.  It may be hard to implement, but we know what it is.
  Some other reviewers have compared this to ""Food, Inc.,"" which was very eye-opening but dragged quite a bit and didn't necessarily point towards a specific solution to the problem of our food supply.  Maybe this movie did a better job because it picked a specific ""character"" to follow and so had sharper focus.  It's been a long time since I've been so happy about a film.

4464264,5,B004SO26RE,"I really enjoyed this documentary. It was well laid out and clearly presented. I learned about the importance of bees in pollinating fruits and vegetables (such as almonds, blueberries, and cranberries). I learned that migratory beekeepers truck their bees from orchard to orchard where the bees are needed, and they might use practices such as artificially inseminating the queen or killing the queen every few months (by pinching it's head off). I learned that beekeepers all over the world have experienced colony collapse disorder and though it's not known exactly what chemicals are having sub-lethal effects on the bees, systemic pesticides are suspect.

I learned that older generation pesticides were sprayed on plants but that the newer systemic pesticides like gaucho or poncho are incorporated directly on the seed or into the ground. The systemic pesticides end up moving through plants and expressing themselves in the the plants' leaves, pollen, or nectar.

It's quite disturbing that the EPA doesn't do it's own research or take a pre-cautionary stance.

Either way, this was an enjoyable film interrelating the health of bees and the health of the environment. The only thing was, I don't think Ellen Page's voice was quite suitable for narrating (she sounds too quiet and passive).",1349654400,,1298,5.260869565217392

4464268,4,B004SO26RE,"It would be nice if they would update this and would quit harping on organic farming.  Organic does not mean chemical free and safe for bees or anyone else for that matter. What is really needed is to implement integrated pest management systems along with multiple crop rotations over 6 or 7 years.  We also need to cut back on the chemials that are used to condition the soils.

I am not sure if anyone else watching this was stressed when they showed how many miles the bees travelled by flatbed truck, but I know I was just stressed just thinking about having to make that journey by plane, let alone truck.  Travel weakens any living thing.  Then you add pesticides, the unhealthiness of eating only one type of pollen for weeks on end and it becomes very easy to see how the bees can get weakened and die.  Imagine if you were to ride along with a hive for a year. Then when you get to the field, you eat only that fruit or vegetable until it is time to travel again.  I will bet you would only make it one or two stops.

The use of BT modified plants and systemic chemicals are proving to be much more dangerous than originally thought.  These high yield plant varieties are only giving those high yields for a few years.  Designed that way? Only Monsanto knows.  The BT corn is now a favourite feast of the cut worms that were supposed to be killed by BT.  But is BT now killing our bees too? Oh yeah, BT is ""all natural"" and safe to use, or is it?

4464271,2,B004SO26RE,"Fascinating topic ('colony collapse disorder,' that is) but the treatment here is very, very lean on fact, statistics, empirical/historical context, etc.  Rather what we have in 'Vanishing of the Bees' is semi-educated hypothesizing and heartfelt sentiment from distraught beekeepers; rambling homage from 'experts' on bee mythology; political grandstanding and finger-pointing from anti-pesticide activists and, wait! they do spend a lot of time interviewing a UC Berkeley professor, Michael Pollan, a smart-looking chap who certainly must have a degree in agriculture or botany, or perhaps zoology, er, entomology?  Mmmm, no, false alarm.  Mr. Pollan-- a very nice man, I'm sure-- earned his Master's in English and holds a chair in journalism at Cal.  Were no actual scientists available to talk to?  Why, yes-- Pennsylvania's 'Acting State Apiarist' of PSU's Entomology Department!  Unfortunately, while he is crazy-casual, genial and entertaining, he seems to have more questions than answers.  Two other scientists appear but speak only to the possible causal impact of pesticides on CCD (which is inconclusive at best) and not to the issue at large, which goes far beyond the implications of external chemical regulation.  Finally the script, which wants to be more authoritative than its featherweight narration allows, comes across like a 'persuasive essay' I might have written for seventh-grade science class, as read by me in the fifth grade.

So, overall, as documentaries go, VOTB thankfully is not sensationalistic or even particularly alarmist in tone (though the second half becomes increasingly tendentious, dropping any pretense of a balanced investigation to reveal itself as boilerplate environmentalist propaganda); it is, however, simply, frustratingly, disorganized and slight.
