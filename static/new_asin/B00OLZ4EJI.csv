8684159,3,B00OLZ4EJI,"Personally I think this is the worst movie ever made, yet my friend was having a birthday and I needed to bring a gift. I saw this on Amazon and could believe they made a Blu-ray version. He bought this years ago on VHS, then DVD, yet did not know about the Blu-ray version. I'd rather box a kangaroo, while one of my arms is tied behind my back than watch Killer Klowns From Outer Space, but it makes a great - bad gift and as always Amazon shipping rocks.",1534118400,,457,4.088888888888889

8684167,5,B00OLZ4EJI,"If you are a fan of old fifties quasi sci-fi monster movies then this will be right up your alley. It was made in the same vein as the blob with the same antagonists. However you may notice that Officer Mooney (John Vernon) is still playing Animal House (1978.)

The theory that this may be the source of people being spooked by clowns is plausible after watching this movie.

Finally a movie where the popcorn sticks to your ribs, and what ever. The cotton candy has a 50's spin to it. And this movie will clown around with your mind. You won't be disappointed. See Suzanne Snyder (Debbie Stone) again in Weird Science (1985).

The DVD is loaded with the standard goodies. Thirteen year later the directors discus the original intent and some unique problems. There are out takes. And may other pieces of information to make viewing the movie fun.",1496016000,2,848,4.602649006622516
