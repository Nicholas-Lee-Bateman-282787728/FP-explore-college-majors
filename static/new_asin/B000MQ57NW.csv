8170968,5,B000MQ57NW,"I loved this video it really shows a unique side to Jimi hendrix , and a view on the beginnings of the hippie new age , plus some really good music, bu t also the times, although it is 1970-71, it is still the 1960s. The video itself is great condition and remastered it seems, great quality. i am going to watch it again and i might not be selling this video usually i will sell or give a video away after watching it, but i am holding onto this one, thanks so much.",1526860800,,467,3.978723404255319

8170971,5,B000MQ57NW,funny ive been trying to  get this dvd/cd for years now here is something far out I was at the concert in at rainbow bridge on halelakuka volcano 5000 feet up  there were about 400-500 hippies at this amazing concert. This was by invitation only concert I sat about 15-20 feet from the front stage needless to say this was one of the best concerts I ever attened. I was totally out of my mind having smoked DMT with the brothers of eternal love that's what they called themselves they were the people who organized this thing wow triple wow it was out of sight and mind. I would love to get  in touch with anyone who was there my email is mweiss99@cox.net if you were there feel free to connect with me. I would love it the music the site everything was just great. Hendrix was just great,1433289600,5,788,4.275167785234899
8170972,4,B000MQ57NW,Was chosen basically for the artist.  The movie was a little dificult to follow.  The concert footage was excellent and the best part of the movie.,1391212800,2,147,4.615384615384615
8170973,2,B000MQ57NW,The only reason I bought this piece of historical weirdness as I knew folks that where there for the concert. This validated what memory they had of all the Orange Sunshine and the Brotherhood of Eternal Love. The books set the background.,1382918400,,239,4.714285714285714
8170974,4,B000MQ57NW,In good condition and was sealed. But it does not play on the PS3. Format is not compatible. Everything else was fine.,1375833600,,118,4.409090909090909
8170975,1,B000MQ57NW,"Foreign made piece of crap. Sent back and still haven't received a refund from ""Deep Discount."" The minute I pushed the DVD into my new player, a sign popped up and read: WILL NOT PLAY. I was very upset and still am. I feel like I've been conned and as a P.I. of 45 years, I won't put up with it and no one else should either.",1374969600,,326,3.8805970149253732
8170976,4,B000MQ57NW,"Well, this is a very bizarre little film: It starts off being about this girl, Pat Hartley, leaving the Left Coast and going to the island of Maui, where some very strange UFO freaks have this foundation-- The Rainbow Bridge Foundation, and have New Age lectures from freaky old ladies who talk about Space Bases on the fifth moon of Jupiter, and a strange albino who tries to persuade a horny hippie chick not to try to hump him, and some instructions about meditation and other far-out New Age atuff.  About this time we meet some arriving surfers who have just smuggled a bunch of hashish from the far east in a hidden compartment in his surfboard, he and his buddies cut the board open, amd start smoking it, and we see some surf footage of the same kids for a little while, when Pat Hartley, the girl from the begginning of the movie starts to party with Jimi Hendrix back at the Rainbow Bridge Foundation. Jimi starts laying down some spaced-out rap on Pat, talking about how he'd like to ball her, and how Cleopatra is dressed up like a Social Worker with a mattress tied to her back screaming ""Curb service! Curb Service!,"" and then it's time for Jimi's show. A couple hundred spaced-out hippies sort of stagger up the mountainside, and hang out in front of the stage, and then Jimi comes on and does his thing for a half hour or so, and the film ends.

Really. It's that disjointed. It doesn't make much more sense watching it today than it did when I originally saw it as a midnite movie 29 years ago in a rather inhebriated condition. Be that as it may, it's got Jimi's second-to-last performance ever in the U.S., and it gives us a few songs off his never to be released ""First Rays Of The New Rising Sun"" LP like ""Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)"", and a few old numbers, and then it's over... the sound quality of the concert could have been better (actually the 2nd set was filmed but never released, allegedly because the wind blew too hard into the microphones, and the sound quality was even worse, but the Purple Haze 001 CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rainbow-Bridge-Concert/dp/B0000CB806/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rainbow Bridge Concert</a>&nbsp;has both sets almost complete, and gives lie to that rumor).

For a lot of us kids in the U.S. back in the '70's, this was our first or second introduction to seeing Jimi Hendrix actually play; although several shows had been filmed, only this, ""Woodstock"", and the bio film ""Jimi Hendrix"" were actually screened much in the U.S.A. in the decade after his death. It's quite a little cultural artifact. It doesn't dissapoint, but better films and more material has surfaced and been released in the last 30 years-- see the (more or less) complete ""Woodstock"" performance, ""Wild Blue Angel"", ""Live At Monterey"", ""Band Of Gypsies"", and ""Jimi Plays Berkley.""

Rhino released a ""Director's Cut"" of this on the old VCR format about a decade ago, that ran 125 minutes-- most of the new footage was more New Age programming from the Rainbow Bridge Foundation, and none of it was from Jimi's performance at the end of the film. It is unclear whether this is that edit, or the original film's edit.",1256860800,12,3204,4.788426763110308
