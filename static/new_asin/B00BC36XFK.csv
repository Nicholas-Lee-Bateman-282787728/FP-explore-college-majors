5573628,4,B00BC36XFK,"I am a huge fan of the show and I usually wait for each episode with impatience. This season though I found myself not that engaged with the story-line. Last season ended with a loud bang, with Bill gaining some scary powers and Eric, Sookie and the rest of the band running away from the compound. Here we see how the story continues and the series quickly jumps into topics that have to do with Warlow, Sookie's past and a powerful anti-vampire group.

The premise of the story is not bad, but the first half of the season the execution is lacking. It almost feels as if the writers did not really know which direction to take this series in. Finally, in the second half of the season, the story picks up and the end is much better than the beginning. Overall though, it is clearly the weakest season so far and it has shown in the drop in ratings.

Sadly, this was probably one of the contributing factors for HBO to decide that there will only be one more season of this show. I truly hope that the last season is better than this one and we get the ending that the series deserves. It would also be good if they go back to 12 episodes, since 10 feels a little short. When things started to get good, the season ended.",1378252800,76,1222,4.262931034482759
5573629,5,B00BC36XFK,"I think season sixth was great!!! I loved how bad Bill was and how we got to see Eric in a new light. I feel that the show kept me going, I watch it every Sunday night without fail. I hope that Eric isn't really gone because I am crazy over him and I don't want to see Bill leave either. I love that Sookie finally got some wolf on her plate. To bad we missed that part. I hope that the next season is just as good. I hope that Bill gets to catch a break next season because he has been bad long enough. And would some one please kill Sarah Newlin. I am one of your biggest fans!!!!!!!!",1377907200,6,586,3.8512396694214877
5573630,3,B00BC36XFK,"(Warning: spoilers ahead)

In years to come-True Blood fans may look back on the scene from episode 9 where all the vampires are dancing and holding hands like a bunch of idiot as the PRECISE moment when True Blood jumped the shark.  Now I'm not saying season 6 is all bad or even terrible.  It's still True Blood so it's still entertaining.  In some ways, I even thought it was an improvement over the disappointing season 5.  The problem however seems to be two-fold:

1) This season lacked the feel of a ""real"" True Blood season.  It almost felt like a ""side season"" or something not quite a part of the actual series but still related (sort of like Battlestar Gallactica one-offs like ""The Plan"" and ""Blood and Chrome"").  It just felt sort of empty and insignificant with no big threat or real enemy to fight.  The big-bad this season looked like it was going to be Warlow.  In the end however Warlow just came across as a chump, died like a chump and never really added much of anything to the story arch except for giving Sookie something and some ONE to do.  The governor-another possible central threat likewise seemed unimportant and added nothing to the bigger picture.  And what about Billith?  Sookie was right on the nose when she said, ""you're not a god Bill, you're just an a** hole.""  So really, out of three possible threats-there wasn't really much of any threat or any kind of real substance to keep the viewer interested.

2) This season was all over the place and I mean REALLY all over the place.  Many of the characters we know and love seemed to do completely irrational things or they just became more and more unlikeable as the season went on.  Eric was particularly nasty in the beginning, Bill was pretty much a dirt bag throughout even when he wasn't being Billith and even Alcide-who seems like one of the most morally grounded characters on the show became more and more unlikeable by the time the season ended.  Also-the story seemed to change on a whim without any true direction as to where they were taking it.  For those of you who watched this season-look back and try to describe it.  You can pretty sum it all up in a sentence or two.  ""So yeah, the government decides to capture vampires to study and torture them then there's this Warlow guy who may or may not be a bad guy that Sookie jumps all over even though she's been giving Alcide the cold shoulder for years, oh and Bill is a god-somehow that factors into things, though I don't really see how....""

Don't get me wrong.  This season was still entertaining and I still enjoyed watching it, but it just feels like if they don't start to right the ship a bit, True Blood could become the next show to fizzle out creatively and make us wish for it to end.  Please, writers-get this show back on track.  I miss the quality of the first four seasons.

PS: Writers- please also kill off Bill.  Pretty pretty please.  His character has run its course, and he's been a  d**che bag for about three or four seasons now.",1377129600,58,3007,4.476102941176471
5573631,4,B00BC36XFK,"TRUE BLOOD has been my favorite show on TV since its inception. Each year, Alan Ball envisioned another one of Charlaine Harris's books, with excellent results. Season 5 however stopped following the books. Instead, last year initiated characters and plot lines, which season 6 resolves. First of all there's Warlow, a powerful, malicious vampire who killed Sookie's parents, and has a claim on her life. The last episode of season 5 created the character of ""Billith"", an amalgamation of the vampire goddess Lilith, and Bill retooled as a religious fundamentalist. Along with Warlow, the other primary antagonist for this season is the vampire hating governor of Louisiana, Truman Burrell. This season introduced some new characters. Fans of the books, will be pleased to learn that the fairy prince Niall, perfectly portrayed by Rutger Hauer (Blade Runner), has escaped from a parallel dimension to aid his grandchildren Sookie and Jason, in their fight against Warlow. While walking to work, Sookie meets Ben, a handsome stranger she develops feelings for. The other storylines include the Billith-Jessica arc, as Bill tries to understand his new godlike powers, and how he is to prevent his vision of the vampire cast members from meeting the sun. Another arc is Eric-Pam-Tara-Nora, all on the run from the genocidal war that Governor Burrell is waging against all vampires. The Alcide-Sam-Emma-Nicole arc revolves around the fallout from Luna's death, Emma's fate, Alcide's role as Pack Master, and the human rights worker Nicole, who quickly replaces Luna, as Sam's new special someone. Last of all, we have the Bellefleur axis (Terry, Arlene, Sheriff Andy and his fairy daughters). Terry still feels guilty from killing his Marine Sargent last season, while Andy's four fairy hybrid daughters create situations as they grow up ""overnight"". Finally, lets call Governor Burrell, his girlfriend Sara Newlin, and his daughter Willa, another axis. If all that sounds like a confusing mess, it is.

The basic problem with this many story arcs, and character clusters, is how to keep them linked together, however tenuously. Throughout most of the season, you have Sookie, Ben, Niall and Jason exploring the Warlow dilemma, the vampires fighting Governor Burrell in and around the vampire concentration camp, Alcide and the werewolf pack chasing after Sam, Emma and Nicole, and the Bellefleurs worrying about Terry's insanity, and Andy's half fairy daughters. At best you have cohesion during the first and last episodes. Alan Ball's departure from the show, and the trouble finding a suitable replacement, may be partly to blame for the disjointed vibe. This year was said to portray the theme that evil corrupts, embodied by Bill's megalomania caused by wielding Lilith's powers, Alcide's new role as packmaster of the werewolves, and the Governor's power over the world's vampires, and their True Blood supply. However, which year DIDN'T portray the corruption of power? (Marnie, Salome, the Newlins, etc.) My major complaint, was the lack of interaction Sookie had with most the cast, especially Sam, Eric and Tara. Others have had problems with all the strange creatures, like the vampire-god hybrids, fairy-human hybrids, vampire-fairy hybrids, shifter-human hybrids, and shifter-werewolf hybrids. (Yes, these are all in the show this year.) For a show that takes itself so seriously, its become pretty wacky. Of course, the number of episodes was limited to ten, due to Anna Paquin's pregnancy. The tenth episode set up season seven, promising vampire-zombie hybrids, and a symbiotic allegiance between vampires and the human citizens of Bon Temps. Waiting between seasons doesn't suck like it used to.  Let's just hope we don't end up waxing nostalgic for the ""good ole days"" of Terry's fire monster.",1377129600,9,3808,5.302980132450331

Creator (of the show, not the books in which they're based on) and showrunner Alan Ball left True Blood (to helm Cinemax's Banshee, great show) after the fifth season and this worried a lot of fans. While I can say that this show has changed a lot from season 1 to season 6, it has been a natural progression and one that I don't feel was too forced. That being said, I didn't find season 6 as engaging or enthralling as the previous 5 seasons, which is sad because this season puts all of the main characters in the most danger yet. The show is still filled with gore, tons of nudity and some really cool action scenes and one liners that this show has become so popular for. Yet I found myself not being as emotionally invested in these characters as I normally am.

Season 6 brings back Anna Camp (Pitch Perfect) as Steve Newlin's estranged wife Sarah, and we have some new characters like Ben Flynn played by Robert Kazinsky (Pacific Rim) and  Nicole Wright played by the beautiful Jurnee Smollett-Bell (Friday Night Lights). But for me I thought Arliss Howard (Wilder Napalm) as Truman Burrell and Rutger Hauer (Bladerunner) as fairy king Niall Brigant were the stand out new additions to the show. As per usual, this is a character driven series but this season all bets are off for who lives and who dies. With tainted True Blood about to hit shelves, most of the main vampires locked up by Governor Burell, Sookie is after Warlow before he gets her, Jason is as confused as ever, and Bill has no idea who he is or what powers he has, or for how long he'll have them.

While some characters are dramatically down played from previous seasons (I feel like Sookie and Alcide had the least amount of screen time this season, until the last two episodes) we see a lot of Eric and Pam and Jessica and these new characters which helped make this season feel a bit more fresh, and at the same time a bit distant and stale when compared to previous seasons. Ultimately I think anyone who is a True Blood fan will enjoy season 6, it has some big moments, fills in some blanks from previous season loose ends, and delivers a lot of the things we've come to love from this show. Granted this is probably the weakest season since season 2, I still enjoyed it as much as I ever do. There were some very cool throw-away scenes in the last two episodes that were very reminiscent of season 1 and had a very light hearted feeling to it. And the last 2 episodes were the best of the season. Of course it ends with a cliff hanger to segue nicely into season 7. True Blood isn't for everyone, but for anyone who has been watching this show for the last 5 seasons, you'll be in for some great treats in season 6.",1376870400,128,3389,4.604304635761589

While I believe the stage prop guys for this film had a great time making it as gruesome as possible, the story content was so shallow, borrowed and blatantly transparent, I couldn't really enjoy even the gruesome-ness of it all.  Of course, to be fair, I only watched a small portion of one episode from one season, but I felt it was long enough to get the hint that someone was not really trying too hard for that paycheck at the end of that day anyway.

I think it sucks and appeals only to a amphibian-level intellect. Vampires? Really? If you enjoy watching something this stupid, you can always watch the debates, or soccer, or freakin Rachel Ray, and those are probably free to watch. Save your cash and donate it to the homeless guy on the corner, at least he'll get good and drunk and pass out, which would be vastly more entertaining than this stretch of any commonsense. I have noticed that mostly chicks like this kind of show, but if your a guy and like it? I wouldn't tell nobody, not even your significant other, as this a negative in the Manliness sector that you will never recover from, may as well turn in your Mancard and unused testicles.

5574743,4,B00BC36XFK,"I loved the first four seasons of True Blood mainly because of Sookie's chemistry with Eric.  By Season 5 and Season 6, the little town of Bon Temps, LA is juggling too many crazy (truly bizarre) storylines.  Even the humor the character ""Jason Stackhouse"" (played by Ryan Kwanten ) & the lusty good looks of Eric (played by Alex Skarsgard) can't completely salvage this season.

Still, you HAVE  to watch it because if you miss a single hunky scene of Alex Skarsgard, you will hate yourself.  Alex Skarsgard as Eric Northman makes the whole series.",1474243200,,549,4.7368421052631575

5574954,4,B00BC36XFK,"TrueBlood continues to enthrall, but I must admit that occasionally I played CandyCrush whilst simultaneously flicking my eyes toward the iPad screen, so in short, the early episodes of TB's Season Six were not as riveting as past seasons'.  The Lilith plot grew tiresome, and I began to forget why she mattered at all, then The Authority subplot came to mind, and I said, ""Oh, yeah, that's why.""  The werewolves/shifters subplot with Alcid drugged me with its melodrama, and frankly, the subplot seemed designed to fill time.  However, midway the episodes became more interesting and kept CandyCrush at bay.  The writers continue to mimic and mock our current times' angst, casting the Age of Uncertainty on fairies, rednecks, vampires, and werewolves, making them our avatars.  And, of course, just when you think Bon Temps will get a break . . . . it doesn't, and I can hardly wait until Amazon releases Season Seven, where this skein of craziness will be resolved.

I was so worried someone at home would walk in on me and think I was watching porn.  Sookie and Bill are the main characters but I sure liked Pam and Eric so much better.  They were awesome in their roles.  There are some plot lines that are rather repetitive and tiring. How many times can one person be taken hostage and chained up? I watched all 6 seasons so I must have liked it well enough but I sure don't get all of the hype. Anna Paquin won several awards for her portrayal of Sookie but really I was not so impressed with her acting. The Southern accents were a bit over the top and with me being from the Louisiana and Mississippi, the accents aggravated me to listen to. The blood sucking slurping was just yuk, I kept thinking ""not again!.""  But I watched 6 season so hey, guess it wasn't so bad.
