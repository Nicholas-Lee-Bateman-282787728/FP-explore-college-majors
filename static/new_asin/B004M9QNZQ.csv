4429034,5,B004M9QNZQ,"I'm interested in all kinds of different things from the ancient world. Especially the Medieval & Regency Periods in England. I'm constantly trying to write stories for my own enjoyment, and am always looking for all kinds of information that might help in that endeavor. I've seen this Documentary on TV and completely enjoyed it. This DVD was exactly the same with nothing left out. I was totally happy with it. Another one to watch is a DVD called ""Going Medieval"" -(another Great Documentary to buy) :-)",1370822400,7,507,4.839080459770115
4429035,5,B004M9QNZQ,This DVD is a wonderful look into history as to why the dark affects us so.  It is perfect for anyone who loves to look into human behavior as to why we behave the way we do toward old fears.,1364342400,5,191,3.775
8435762,4,B004M9QNZQ,"A fascinating documentary of Man's history with the night and how humanity has faced the night and the horrors we believed and saw in the darkness. From wild animals, demons, robbers, fire, ghost and what have you, this documentary is not just a documentary of superstition and religious interpretation of the night but the psychological deep rooted fears of the night that made me think of differently of the night and made me want to read more about it.

Based on the book ""At Day's close"" by A. Roger Ekrich that goes into a deeper depth than a 90+ documentary but the movie is a great introduction into the subject of the night and man's history with it. I Recommend this as is still shows the history channel can put good show that isn't just aliens, conspiracies or both.",1521504000,,777,4.589928057553957

8435769,5,B004M9QNZQ,"This DMV is an absolute must to better understand fear of the dark.  A tremendous amount of time went into this presentation.  Fabulous historic research is the most powerful foundation in this DVD.

I truly enjoyed it.

I set aside evenings to visit my friends and family to share this DVD with.  We all have very deep discussions after the documentary.",1448841600,,354,4.737704918032787
8435770,5,B004M9QNZQ,Nearly every documentary like this I have seen on History Channel has been a good one. And so it this one. Finding out how our early ancestors dealt with day to day (or night to night) problems is an interesting subject to me. Understanding how and why people slept in shifts instead of just through the night. Plus how people dealt with darkness without benefit of any sort of police force. And not only two legged dangers were out there. Depending on where you were in the world many four legged dangers could come out of the dark and ruin your night.,1443052800,3,553,4.431372549019608
