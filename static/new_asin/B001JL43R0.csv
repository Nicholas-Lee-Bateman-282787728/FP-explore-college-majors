3658299,5,B001JL43R0,"This was a well made comprehensive review of a man who has sacrificed so much for the common man.  The couple who dedicated themselves to do this film used not just photography but music that made you think this was a good movie, not a documentary. I was struck by the detail information from persons who knew Barack that I did not see in any video.  The bonus sections were a plus. I had purchased four or five dvd`s on the presidents life but this dvd far exceded my expection.  I will cherish it for times to come.",1252540800,11,517,4.255102040816326

3658302,5,B001JL43R0,"Only two reviews so far on this item, and I note the second has nothing to do with the item itself but is rather someone's big chance to soapbox his negativity about our new President.  Speaking as a consumer and someone interested in this item and perhaps buying it, can reviews please focus on the item itself and its quality/presentation, rather than personal opinions re. the subject?  Thank you.",1232582400,15,400,4.782608695652174
3658303,5,B001JL43R0,"I was looking for a good book about President Obama's life story, and I found this DVD: President Barack Obama: The Man and His Journey. It comes out officially on Inauguration Day, January 20th, and documents both his personal story AND his remarkable campaign up until Election Day. It's really comprehensive; there are amazing interviews and also the beautiful Brian McKnight song for the campaign, ""Yes We Can"". If you've been wanting to know more about this incredible man, I recommend this DVD. I mean it's a keepsake, so I think it's definitely nice to have to look back on how we lived through such a historic election.",1231977600,34,627,4.814814814814815
