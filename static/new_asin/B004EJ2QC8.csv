4337667,5,B004EJ2QC8,"Funny mid-life couple who are actually in love, not badgering each other. They go about their day, he an accountant, she (40) on the constant search of new creative outlets. Viewers do not have to be beyond their 30s to enjoy these mated mates. Hester (Julia McKenzie-`Miss Marple' `Cranford') creates the plots with her newest activity adventure. William (Anton Rodgers-`Lillie' `Dirty rotten Scoundrels' `Affairs of the Heart' `Noah's Ark') saves her or plays along. Always a surprise laugh to end each episode. Neighbor Sonja (Ann Beach) and Hester's mom, Nancy (Fanny Rowe) who lives in the granny house out back, add spark, humor, and the odd situation. Very family oriented, the exception being 2 fast shots of bare upper chest, and a couple of nude paintings that Hester created in art class.

SUBTITLES are included along with filmographies for the couple.
12 humorous PBS episodes, each 25 min., leaving you with the desire for more.

DISH OF THE DAY--Hester tries being a part-time chef at local eatery, Lucy's Kitchen. Her recipe for life has something missing. William to the rescue?

MIDDLE-AGE DREAD-- Hester's newest career attempt is at a trendy boutique. Age & body figure discrimination?

HOOK, LINE AND SINK HER-- William wants to wet a fish line. Hester & Nancy want to tag along. But there is on `odd' fourth person.

THE NAKED TRUTH-- William asks for Hester's help to impress a visiting Bagdad client. Can the Fields deal with the foreign notions?

DES DET RES--Bills & taxes give William a house sale plan. A move? Hester's got a plan of her own.

SOMETHING IN THE OVEN-- Hester's chef job will be reviewed by a media critic. There's more in the oven than cordon bleu.

A NIGHT TO REMEMBER--William plans a surprise 24th wedding anniversary. But BOTH get surprised!

A BRIEF ENCOUNTER-- Does Hester's fencing teacher have more in mind than crossed swords? Will William foil the Casanova's moves? Get the point?

ALRIGHT ON THE NIGHT-- Hester's church concert/bazaar is avoided by William via fishing. Alas--the best laid plans of mice & men OR the Fields. Super episode, my favorite.

IN THE SPRING-- Hester's writing creatively after a neighborhood scandal. The men, William & Hester's dad, have their own affair perspectives.

BUSINESS CONTACTS-- Hester fills in as office secretary when William's real employee, followed by a temp, both are ill. Good thing Hester is so creative--or is it?

GET ME TO THE CHURCH--Emma's wedding to Peter is all set. Hester's the bride's mother. That's NOT good.

Comedy within a solid marriage relationship. Refreshingly fine. Yet risqu at times. For those happily married and over 40, you'll relate. . .often. My wife and I are very glad we watched.",1294272000,9,2710,5.006681514476615
4337668,5,B004EJ2QC8,"BBC has finally released Fresh Fields!  I have been watching this since the 80's on PBS. Since I taped them off of tv I can watch the episodes, however, they are totally wearing out. This is a wonderful series and I hope the Beeb will also release French Fields.",1293753600,10,262,4.346938775510204
4337669,2,B004EJ2QC8,"I like British comedies in general: Last of the Summer Wine, Keeping Up Appearances, and As Time Goes By are some of my favorites. This series just doesn't measure up to those, in my opinion. Times have changed a little too much to make Julia McKenzie's character (Hester) sympathetic. Her kids have left home and, since she doesn't have a job and her husband earns a good income, she now has time to indulge all her interests. I am a middle-aged woman with two small children and a full time job and also the primary wage-earner, so to me Hester seems to have the dream life. I realize expectations and opportunities for women were different in the '70's, but really, why exactly can't she find fulfilling employment? I got bored with her ""problems"" very quickly. On the plus side, Hester is much more rational and intelligent (and therefore more likable) than Lucy Ricardo and Jean from As Time Goes By.",1324252800,,905,4.6625
4337670,5,B004EJ2QC8,"I just now ordered ""Fresh Fields"". I can not wait for it to arrive. It is a charming series and I agree with reviewers who suggest that the, ""As Time Goes By"",crowd will enjoy this show.  Hopefully, ""French Fields"" and ""May to December"", two other Anton Rodgers treats will soon be available in Region 1. Fingers crossed !",1316044800,,322,4.551724137931035
4337671,5,B004EJ2QC8,"I check Amazon all the time to see if Fresh Fields is available.  This is among my favorite Britcoms of all times--rarely, if ever, seen in the US.  The witty script makes visits to the Fields' so much fun.  Sonya's visits (""It's only Sonya!""), calls from Emma, the reappearance of Guy, and Nancy's comments all add to the many dimensions of this couple.  If you enjoy a clever situation comedy, you will enjoy this series.",1313798400,,423,4.6
4337672,4,B004EJ2QC8,"I've loved this series on PBS and was delighted to see the DVD's of series one here on Amazon.  Still just as funny and delightfully entertaining as it was several years ago (when I saw it last on PBS).

But where are the rest of the season?  And French Fields, the follow up series?  The series deserves FIVE STARS, but without the full set one is left wanting much more....",1313366400,,375,4.314285714285714
4337673,5,B004EJ2QC8,Fresh Fields is the series about an empty nest couple and the woman's escapades to find something to do now that her children have left. It's funny and totally charming. The characters are well developed and a joy to watch.,1304467200,,223,4.6
4337674,4,B004EJ2QC8,"Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict -- ""Acorn continues to build its reputation as the most prolific studio bringing Brit content from across the pond. Did I laugh? Nah. It's not my cup of tea, but I can objectively recognize the show's charm and wit, and McKenize and Rodgers have a warm, easygoing chemistry. After sitting through its charms for 12 episodes, I can safely say Fresh Fields is not uproarious, innovative, or groundbreaking, but it's comfortable, likable, and warm, like a well-knitted afghan or a leopard-print Snuggie.""",1303257600,3,534,5.149425287356322
4337675,4,B004EJ2QC8,One of my favorite British Sitcoms. Had not seen it for years until this CD came out. Now I can watch it anytime I like. It is always good for many laughs.,1302566400,,155,3.875
4337676,5,B004EJ2QC8,"Loved the show while it was on PBS and really was great to see it again.  We hope the other seasons come out on CD sooner, rather than later.  Great stories, good clean fun.

I love good humor and adore great humor.  I adore this series, and we'll watch it again very soon.

4337677,5,B004EJ2QC8,"This is a very good series...great characters, good writing and lots of British humor.  I think any fan of ""As Time Goes By"" would really enjoy this series too.  I'm a big fan of Ballard Berkley (""Major Gowen"" from Fawlty Towers) and his contributions to the show as the ""Happy-go-lucky"" father of Hester are not to be missed.  Just a good solid show.  I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out as well as the ""French Fields"" series.  Thanks Acorn!!!",1299369600,6,460,4.428571428571429
4337678,5,B004EJ2QC8,"A got to have collection. Very funny TV, very funny British Comedy, fresh and lively in its presentation.  French Fields follows with the same basic cast.  This is worth the money at twice the price! Fresh Fields ranks as some of the best British television. A thoroughly great experience. Its about time it hit the US.  The series has been out in Britain for some time.  Hopefully they will give us the whole set.",1299196800,,414,4.554054054054054

8427035,5,B004EJ2QC8,"Fresh Fields started on ITV in 1984 and ran for four series. Shortly after, three follow up series aired with a slightly different name, French Fields.
Julia Mackenzie and Antgon Rodgers stars as the married couple living in Barnes SW London with part of the family living in the granny flat at the bottom of the garden.
Fresh Fields is a typical comedy from the Eighties and is suitable for all the family. My two favourite episodes in this set were The Naked Truth and Middle Age Dread.
Well worth a watch!",1356912000,,508,4.532608695652174
