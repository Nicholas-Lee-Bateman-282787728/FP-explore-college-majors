8092641,4,B000BU0BAS,Shelly McDonald is excellent!  Great routine but the angles taken by the camera sometimes don't show what movements she is doing with her legs... So when you're starting with the routine it's a bit frustrating.,1470787200,,210,5.0

8092643,5,B000BU0BAS,"Years ago, I used to tape the Caribbean Workout on FitTv, but I haven't seen it on TV in years.  I was so excited to find these DVDs on Amazon and I purchased several of them.  I attend hour-long fitness classes three times per week and I use these videos on the days in between to get a quick workout in.  I love that they are fast, easy to follow, and Shelly McDonald is such a positive, sweet person that her instructions are fun to watch.  Definitely recommend these!",1393545600,,471,4.258426966292135
8092644,2,B000BU0BAS,"I originally purchased this DVD because it was supposed to be subtitled. No subtitles or closed-captioning to be found (I told Amazon.com to change the description).

And to make things ""worst"" for those who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing, the screen shot focuses on several areas rather than the whole body view.

Wish I could comment on the content of the video, but really can't if I couldn't follow the movements and instructions.

I wouldn't suggest the Caribbean Workout series for those who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing.",1202428800,,525,4.811111111111111
8092645,3,B000BU0BAS,"There are three workouts on this DVD, but the only one I  tried was the chi ball workout and, I was so annoyed that I have no interest in doing the others.  Whoever did the camera work and editing for this needs a good swift kick in the behind.  If it was a travel video, the constant switching to views of the water and the sky and the scenery would be appropriate; however, this is supposed to be a workout video and the camera should remain on the instructor and participants so the viewer can see what the heck they are doing.  Also, the camera often seemed to be focused in on bellies and chests when it should have been providing a full body shot so you could see changes in arm/foot movements.  I suppose if you did the workout often enough, you would be able to anticipate the changes without needing to see them, but when you are first learning, it is definitely a hindrance.  Had I not been so distracted by the camera angles, I might actually have enjoyed this workout.  This is going on my trade pile.",1171670400,7,1013,4.3
8092646,4,B000BU0BAS,"The thing I like most about the Caribbean Workout series is that the segments are 20-25 minutes each.  I hate to exercise, but I can talk myself into 25 minutes at a time.  This DVD contains 3 different workouts that are varied enough to prevent boredom and allow the viewer to choose just one or a combination.  If you want to do more than one, you don't have to do two aerobics sessions; you can do a cardio (aerobics/kickboxing) and a muscle conditioning (chi ball) or strength and flexibility (Pilates).  If variety isn't enough, the setting is beautiful, so, even if I am stuck in my living room, I can at least see the sandy, sun-drenched beaches of Barbados and take my mind off the yucky exercise.",1170979200,2,705,4.52755905511811
8092647,1,B000BU0BAS,"There are too much noise in this DVD, so I can not see. Very bad.

I should not have purchased.

I will never buy from Amazon.",1168300800,,126,3.8076923076923075
8092648,5,B000BU0BAS,"I love Shelley, I think she is one of the best work out instrutors.  The 3 types of work outs are great for a varity.",1141948800,,117,3.68
8092649,4,B000BU0BAS,"This DVD contains 3 - 20 minutes workouts from the Caribbean Workout TV show.  I was expecting 3 sculpting workouts with weights to be here but that is not exactly the case.  But after doing each of the workouts I am still pleased with this purchase.

The first segment is muscle conditioning, but it is actually a kickboxing workout with some toning work done with light weights.  Shelly McDonald leads here and is joined by Joanna and Carolyn.  The kickboxing workout is a lot of fun, but the toning work is pretty sparse.  They use one set of dumbells here.  For the kickboxing you will see all the punches, jabs, crosses, hooks and upper cuts, blocks, elbow strikes, knee smashes, front, back and side kicks.  Many of them are done in combination as well as on their own.  The toning work is brief but includes double arms rows, rear delt raises w/rear leg lifts, squats some adding a rear leg lift, and some standing ab work.  There are some minor cueing mistakes, but it isn't too bad.  The atmosphere is very relaxing as Shelly includes her friends in the conversations and it makes it more fun.

There is also a pilates segment here, Jen Tilley actually leads this part, she is joined by Shelly.  The focus here is the abs and back, the exercises in this segment include rollbacks (later adding rotation), pendulum, scissors, bridge (later  lifting/lowering leg), teasers (modified/advanced), single and double leg kicks, single leg circles, corkscrew, back extensions, breastroke, pushups, and the diamond.  Most of the exercises aren't too difficult but there are some advanced like the teaser and leg pull.  The leg pull is where you are in a reverse plank position and you lift and lower one leg at a time.  I found these to be pretty challenging and just left them out, maybe one day I will be able to do them.  I would definitely recommend this segment for those already familiar with pilates.

The last segment is a chi ball workout, where you use a small weighted ball, any ball would work though.  Shelly leads this segment along with Joanna and Carolyn.  Shelly says that this isn't a true chi ball workout, just an adaptation and her own variation.  But there is a variety of moves here where you are doing simple footwork while raising/lowering the ball or passing it from one hand to the other.  There are also some lunges and squats in this segment.  This segment isn't difficult by any means, but I found it interesting and there were times that my arms were actually getting a little tired.  I plan on using this segment for days where I want a some light toning and in the mood for something different.  I really enjoyed it.

This DVD contains a nice variety and I think is well worth the money.  The workouts are filmed in Barbados, so the scenery is awesome.  For the chi ball workout the scenery is especially nice, it is darker out but you can see the sun setting and there are some torches around to keep the area a little bit lit.  Kind of a moonlight workout.  I would definitely recommend this DVD along with Caribbean Workout aerobics and kickboxing DVDs.  They are a great deal for the price.",1137283200,36,3127,4.618874773139746
