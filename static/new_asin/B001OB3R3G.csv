8330077,4,B001OB3R3G,"- 2 out of 5 matches are exciting. They are Victor Belfort vs Scott Ferrozzo, and Mark Coleman vs Dan Severn. Victor is fast and furious. Mark is excellent at counter attacking.

- This DVD is definitely worth watching",1392940800,,218,4.589743589743589
8330078,3,B001OB3R3G,"UFC 12 was a night of firsts in mma. This was the first event in ufc history to be not hold at least an 8-man tournament. The ufc decided for this event to set up  two four-man tournaments and finally institute weight classes, a 199 & under class and a 200 & above. It was somewhat pointless however as the two winners, Jerry Bohlander and a debuting Vitor Belfort, were seperated by less than 5 lbs. It was a night when a heavyweight title was also created. Dan Severn fought Mark Coleman, who took over the spot of don frye, in a battle of two of the biggest competitors the ufc had seen up until that point. It was a letdown however as Severn was submitted rather easily by Coleman in under three minutes.",1231804800,3,708,4.2835820895522385
