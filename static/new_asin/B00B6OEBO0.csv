5559854,4,B00B6OEBO0,"Very Dark comedy.  I agree with the person who said it is so dark it's almost not comedic, and yet it still is. Very American Beauty (the leads phone had its theme as his ring tone) but wickedly entertaining.  Banks has a great scene at the end which made me appreciate her more than I ever had before and Linney just steals the film with her crazy, horny cat lady routine.  McGuire is good, but I would have liked it better with somebody else. Either way it still works and is delightfully bleak about the way people and life really are a lot of the time. Special plug for Haysbert who is excellent as well.",1375488000,2,608,4.269565217391304
5559855,4,B00B6OEBO0,"This film was my kind of film; Quirky,funny, dark, serious, and idiosycratic all together. Toby Mcquire who stars in it as the main character, for me was the perfect choice to play this role. Three turns as Spider Man in that huge money making franchise might for him have been enough.  This role really, in my opinion, allows him to venture off into more of his acting chops talent. He continues to bring forth all of the character's vulnerability especially with his extraordinary expressive face-emotionsand especially so in the closeups. Now Toby is not alone in his performance. He is unbelievably backed-supported by an extraordinary cast!!! Academy award winner in my understanding; Ms. Laura Linney, Academy nominee, Kerry Washington, Elizabeth Banks,Ray Liotta, Dennis Haysbert, and the cast list continues....  Who would of thought it?  The film was released last yr .Nov 7th in a limited nation-wide release. This means in my understanding to appox 600 plus movie theatres nationwide.  How did the Weinstein co. promote this or not promote this film!!!!  They must have had their heads up their behinds!!  The film's director-co
writer, Jacob aaron Estes did he create this jewel in vain?  I don't think so...But I'll ask again,Why was this film not promoted more?
Yet, Toby Mcquire's current project, The Great Gatsby is being promoted to the heavens!! So to speak.

In conclusion, I encourage any and all  true film buffs, actors,directors, writers, producers, afficionados, and of course, Robert Osborne of Turner Classics, to show this film on TCM and invite some of the cast members as well as the director-writers on his show!! and have a discussion of how it fell thru the cracks...

5559856,4,B00B6OEBO0,"At first I didn't want to continue watching but next thing you know the movie is done.  Good performances from Tobey and Linney and everyone in general.  I didn't read any plot synopsis so I didn't know what to expect and the twists and turns were well timed.  Overall enjoyed it in a creepy way which is what a dark comedy is supposed to do.  Didn't give it a 5 star because it wasn't great, but enjoyable nonetheless",1370217600,,418,4.32051282051282
5559857,4,B00B6OEBO0,"""The Deails"" brought to mind Woody Allen's masterpiece ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" where reasonably good people do unspeakable things and reasonably good people have horrific things happen to them.  This film isn't quite in that category.  I don't know whether to characterize it as a dark comedy with serious overtones or vice versa.  Regardless, it just doesn't have the bite of Allen's film.  Where does the fault lie?  The supporting players are uniformly good with a special shoutout for Laura Linney as the ditzy neighbor.  I think it comes down to the central performance of Tobey Maguire as the nice guy next door who through circumstance is forced to make immoral choices.  The role does require that his character be affable but Maguire doesn't seem to have the range where you could believe him capable of the unthinkable.  An interesting and moderately thought provoking film that falls oh so short.",1368316800,,909,5.053691275167785
5559858,5,B00B6OEBO0,"This is a classic. It is a dark comedy which will have you laughing and at the same time saying WoW poor guy! On some level it reminds us of our own lives, even though the story itself is about his life and the endless "" what next is going to happen to me?!"" it is similar to our own lives, those times when life just seems to throw one thing after the next at us and we are thinking ""how did I get in this situation?!"" You can understand him, which pulls you into the movie.",1367107200,2,475,3.9072164948453607

8563379,4,B00B6OEBO0,"Excellent dark comedy with Tobey Maguire as the protagonist Jeff Lang with Elizabeth Banks playing his wife Nealy. Twisted story with great supporting cast who all get to shine, especially Laura Linney, who has the scene stealing part as their crazy neighbor. SPOILER: I think one of the problems with the movie is Jeff Lang isn't just the ""anti-hero"", he's actually the villain. He's really not a nice guy. At all.

8563382,3,B00B6OEBO0,"Jeff Lang (Tobey Maguire) seems to have it all, a great career, beautiful family...and then it starts to fall apart: Raccoons tear up his new lawn. This drives him crazy and this is just the first of many bad things that happen, all leading up to cold-blooded murder.

This is a dark comedy with many funny and silly moments and just as many bizarre and absurd ones. Maguire is good as the Everyman character, but I thought Elizabeth Banks was way too teenage-Barbie doll-ish to play his wife. Dennis Haysbert is Jeff's loyal best friend and Laura Linney steals the show as his pathetic, loony neighbor.

There are lots of twists and turns and it was fun to watch until the end, which just stops, like the director ran out of time and told everyone to go home. The non-ending almost spoils a good movie and left me unsatisfied.",1386028800,,827,4.543624161073826
8563383,3,B00B6OEBO0,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

As I sat reflecting on the events in The Details, I couldn't help but ask, ""What the f*** did I just watch?"" Normally I wouldn't slap you with a profanity in the first sentence of a review, but anyone who's seen this movie understands that this reaction is more than appropriate. The Details is one of those movies that slipped under the radar for me, as I'm sure it did for many others, and the only reason I watched it was because I caught a glimpse of the box at the video store. Tobey Maguire. Ray Liotta. Elizabeth Banks. Ok, you have my attention. However, while I went in expecting a fun, quirky little movie, The Details is anything but.

To say that Jeff Lang (Maguire) has a crazy life would be a bit of an understatement. Jeff's a surgeon living in your everyday suburbia with his wife Nealy (Banks) and son. Because they live a financially comfortable life, the Langs are looking to do some renovations. With a second child on the way, Jeff and Nealy think it would be a good idea to add on to the house. Not only that, but Jeff also wants to fix up the backyard with some new grass. As if their relationship wasn't rocky enough, the difficulties that arise while doing this housework are about to make everything a whole lot worse. From crazy raccoons to their sociopathic neighbor, Lila (Laura Linney), things are about to get very difficult for this family of three.

The thing that surprised me most about The Details was how incredibly dark it was. Not in the tone that flows throughout the film's 91 minutes, that's surprisingly whimsical, but in the topics it chooses to discuss during this time. You see, Jeff is an undiagnosed sex addict and this is largely the biggest problem with his marriage. There's little-to-no intercourse between him and Nealy which winds up landing him in some hot water later on. Not only that, but he's extremely selfish for a large portion of the movie and he's also manipulative. Then there's the aforementioned Lila and his struggling friend Lincoln (Dennis Haysbert) -- he's stuck at a low paying job and he needs a kidney transplant. The cherry on top? Infidelity. It seemed as if every fifteen minutes someone was having sex with someone else who wasn't their spouse. Knowing all this, and seeing it written out, it's weird that The Details manages to keep a lighthearted tone throughout majority of its running time.

This pessimistic representation of humanity isn't what killed it for me, though. My biggest issue with The Details is that, apart from hitting you with one bad character trait after the next, it's not all that interesting to watch. It's very possible that the dull nature of the film is a product of all the negativity, but even without the dread that follows you through Jeff's story I still can't see the tale being terribly interesting. Jeff's antics with the racoons became old after the second encounter and Nealy never felt like she was important to the story being told. In fact, the only time she did feel important was when she laid on another layer of awfulness toward the end. Unfortunately, the worst thing about The Details is not it's dark or repetitive nature, but the predictability that plagues the final 30 minutes or so. Once you gain an understanding of the characters it becomes very easy to predict what's going to happen and a good 90% of my predictions were right.

With that said, not everything about The Details is full of doom and gloom. There are brief glimpses of humanity -- from Jeff, surprisingly, and a few other characters as well -- that help make those dark times worth it. For example, Lincoln is generally a wonderful person who chooses not to complain no matter how dire his circumstance is. He's accepting the hand he was dealt and that kind of attitude is extremely commendable, and welcome, in a movie like this. Also, Peter Mazzoni (Ray Liotta), Jeff's friend, is another character who feels purer than the rest. He may come from a family full of Italian mobsters, but he chooses not to let that identify who he is and he just wants a normal life with a woman who both loves and respects him. He wound up being my favorite character even though he was only in the movie for, like, eight minutes.

Finally, the performances, for the most part, were solid across the board. You may not like these characters, and you may want to throw them off of a bridge, but it would be hard to deny that everyone involved played their roles well. Maguire, in particular, really got into character and I'm surprised at how fitting he felt given how different Jeff is from his past roles. Dennis Haysbert was another standout for me. Part of it was probably how humane Lincoln felt compared to Jeff, but that's not to take away from Haysbert's performance. His ability to convey emotion across the entire spectrum was amazing and he always made you feel something for his character whether it was happiness, sadness, or pity.

Overall Score: 5.75/10 - The problem with The Details is not in its story or its cast, but in the way it's presented. There's some good ideas scattered throughout the movie, but most of the time they come off as sloppy and predictable. Add that to the repetitive nature of the film and the fact that it's not all that fun to watch and you're given a movie that had promise, but failed in its execution. While I can't really recommend this movie to anyone, I wouldn't talk someone out of watching it either. With a movie like this it all comes down to your gut instinct.",1375660800,2,5548,4.632113821138211
