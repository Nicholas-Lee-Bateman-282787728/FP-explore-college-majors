2196857,5,B0006VY6JO,"This is a perfect yoga video. I, like most reviewers, cannot rave enough about Ravi & Ana's DVD's. This one is more non-stop then the other ones. Less rest in between exercises but it never feels frantic like some other Kundalini Warrior Workouts I have tried. I watched it through first just because it is so beautiful to look at. There is lots of emphasis on the breath. Its the most dynamic, inviigorating yoga I have ever done. Ana Brett is obviously a very experienced practitioner. I have seen her in quite a few DVD's now and she is truly awe inspiring. This is probably the most advanced of the RaviAna DVD's and it is challenging. I really felt like I had had a satisfying metabolism boosting workout! I think an intermediate student could benefit from this one. For beginners, I would start with Total Tune Up (still one of my favorites!) or the Ultimate Stretch Workout. Remember that working with where you are is important in yoga. The 1 thing I miss: In his older videos Ravi semed to be saying more spiritual things as you were in the poses. I know some people do not enjoy the mystical side of yoga but I do! Please don't stop all the spiritual support Ravi!",1108598400,15,1174,4.490654205607477
2196858,5,B0006VY6JO,"3 months ago I got the 3 Ravi and Ana DVD's(Warrior Workout, Ultimate Stretch and Navel Power) and they are the most interesting workouts I have ever done.  I have had many years of neck and shoulder pains. I had been seeing a chiropractor 2X a week for a month before I read about these tapes and tried them. I tried the Warrior First(probably a mistake)and ended up feeling more tight in my neck and shoulders then I already did.  By the time I went to sleep that night though I started feeling really good. I slept like a baby and by the morning I felt better then I have in years.

I canceled a couple of my chiropractor appointments because I felt so good. They kept calling me and I finally went in to show them how good I was doing. I had all the doctors coming in and listening to my story about  doing the Kundalini Yoga DVD's They were amazed at how fluid my back really was now. I have been continuing with these DVD's and still maintain more openess and less tension in my neck and shoulders.

I plan to purchase their other DVD's to help me further explore Kundalini Yoga.

Thank you Ravi & Ana for giving me the opportunity to have this experience in my life.",1105747200,17,1173,4.261261261261262
2196859,5,B0006VY6JO,"I was a little afraid of the title but.... this workout is powerful... but doable! I had purchased Ravi & Anas Total Tune Up and was addicted to that for a long time but this one goes beyond in production values and music.

There are warmups. Two parts to the workout and a chanting mediation. It is really easy to break up into segments. It is like buying three DVD's in one.

Every exercise has a breathing pattern along with it. Either Long Deep breathing, Breath of Fire in moving or poses. After one hour of this you will feel amazing, this I guarantee.",1104364800,10,558,4.355769230769231
2196860,5,B0006VY6JO,"About 1,5 year ago the person I go to for SHIATSU , started to attend Kundalini-yoga-classes in Amsterdam.

 He became very, no, extremely enthousiastic and soon he started to teach me a bit at the beginning or end of the shiatsu. And so I started reading about Kundalini and got through him my first Kundalini tape, and soon after I bought the Ravi &  Ana Total Tune Up and Yoga Cleanse DVD's.

 Now I bought the newest DVD's and I am  thrilled with the new workouts!

The Kundalini yoga helped me very much to get out of a very serious depression, to structure and motivate me at the beginning of the day and also to overcome the side-effects of the medication I took.

 It also helps me to keep my lower back in shape because a hyper-mobility off my spine causes me severe back-problems when I meet stress.

The Kundalini-fever infected my life in such a positive way that I am gladly spreading the virus under my friends. The excellent DVD-work-outs are so clear and easy to follow, that it's a very nice way to do yoga on your own when you wake up in the morning.",1103068800,7,1068,4.375634517766497
2196881,5,B0006VY6JO,I practice several forms of yoga and was thrilled to find this DVD...

2196884,5,B0006VY6JO,"I purchased 8 of Ana Brett & Ravi's Kundalini DVD's so far, with plans of purchasing more of them.  I love each and every one of them!  Each one has something different to offer in one way or another.  I rotate them so never get tired of the same old routine.  I feel happier when I practice Kundalini yoga, and am more physically fit.  I am a better person because of Kundalini yoga.  I love the music, instruction, & chanting as well.  Ana is very positive and uplifting as well as an excellent teacher.  Ravi is awesome in his instruction as well.

2196886,5,B0006VY6JO,"Ive done yoga for about 10 years now, have been doing intermidiate forms, mainly vinyasa. this was definitely different than anything ive ever done. I became really emotional during this dvd, not sure if this is the norm for this type of yoga, like crying emotional, but i felt so much better afterward, never experienced anything like this when doing yoga in the past. Ive had some traumatic events, losses and such, over the past 3 years. I believe i was holding onto alot of the negative emotions from this and this dvd helped to cleanse my spirit/chakra if you will, felt lighter afterward, haha. this probably sounds bizarre to some. but this was my experience. Ill being doing kundalini for as long as im able after this. highly recommend trying this, especially if you hold onto a lot of negativity.",1387929600,14,806,4.723404255319149
2196887,5,B0006VY6JO,"I purchased this DVD probably more than 4 years ago now. I had done this and another one of Ravi & Ana's dvds when I was getting myself acquainted to yoga in general. The kundalini style threw me off then, but I still did it a bunch to try and see what it would do for me. I had abandoned it (and most yoga) for years until recently, where I've discovered how utterly crucial and beneficial yoga truly is. I'm older now and I have more patience and attention span to actually get myself through meditative practices. In the past, this would have been nearly impossible as I was on the ""high intensity only"" workout regimen of high impact cardio, plyometrics and strength training. The high from being fit and full of endorphin all the time is starting to wear thin for me and I've rediscovered yoga as a means of getting my mind involved.
Background aside, I dusted off this DVD and did it from start to finish and I felt incredible afterwards. It's a subtle feeling of having your mind and body aligned to feel less stress and negativity all day long. I also have more energy afterwards and I can enjoy the world around me much more. I plan to continue doing more yoga, especially kundalini and I have ordered another one of Ana & Ravi's DVDs.",1384128000,4,1244,4.413043478260869
2196888,5,B0006VY6JO,"If you're looking for a workout that can kick your butt and leave you with that peaceful calm of a yoga session, look no further. But be warned, as others have stated, this is hard work. Warrior Workout was my 5th DVD from Ravi and Ana, and I loved them so much, and they were becoming such a big part of my workout routine, that I wanted to go for something a little harder, but man did I underestimate. This DVD starts off innocently enough, with a warmup that's something of an amped up version of the first half of Begginers and Beyond, before moving into some more strenuous stretches, transformed into a cardio workout.

I have to admit, the first time I tried it, I didn't even make it through the whole workout. Poses I thought I had more or less mastered (ok maybe not mastered, but got the hang of) in Ultimate Stretch, were making me fall over. My legs were shaking, I was getting hungry, trying really hard not to curse Ana out, and I decided to get better control over my poses and try again. And I am so happy I did. This workout is tough, for reasons I can't even really explain, but it is so so worth it. So if you're looking for your first kundalini yoga DVD, even if you are good at other kinds of yoga, it is probably better to start somewhere else, like Ultimate Stretch or Beginners and Beyond.

A must have, I think, but not a first-buy.",1380672000,6,1359,4.263565891472868
2196889,5,B0006VY6JO,"I own several Kundalini yoga dvd's and this is by far one of the most challenging and I wouldn't recommend it for beginners. There was only one pose I could not really get through and that's the one where you stand up and sit down quickly. You will definitely feel this in your legs the next day! After doing kundalini dvd's for a few months now my back pain and plantar fasciitis has improved so much and I feel really good. I'm a convert. This DVD is fun. Some other yoga dvd's I own have me watching the clock but when I put the Raviana DVD's on, time just seems to zip by!",1375574400,2,576,4.106194690265487

2196914,5,B0006VY6JO,"I believe this is the #1 Kundalini DVD out there.  I discovered this Kundalini Yoga Series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh on Amazon about 2 years ago and it is incredible.  I have been doing casual yoga of various sorts here and there (Hatha, Kripalu, etc.) over the years but this series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh fundamentally changed my approach to wellness, fitness,  personal growth and outlook on life.  I was totally new to Kundalini Yoga and, frankly, a but skeptical about it since it has some ""unusual"" moves and poses and chanting compared to other forms of exercise and Yoga I have done at the gym and via DVDs.  Now I see the power of Kundalini via Ana and Ravi ""technology"" that integrates physicality, mindfulness, and spirit.  It is not easy at first - but that is the point.  You do what you can, dot judge yourself and you reap massive benefits.  I progressed quite rapidly from things I felt were impossible but worth trying to not so hard to challenging to ""not hard any more"".  I feel GREAT every single time I complete a DVD - -my mood, my body, my creativity, my stress, my mind clarity, my stamina, etc.  Its truly amazing.  The key to reaping these benefits is to not get caught up in saying ""this is weird"" but to say ""just try it and see how you feel"".  Incredibly fit and wise people did this type of yoga and meditation hundreds and thousands of years ago as a regular regime but Western society has somehow made it non-traditional and inaccessible.  Many other types of Yoga focus too much on the body and physicality and don't see the mind, body, spirit interconnection like Ravi and Ana.  Ravi and Ana make it so accessible - combining direction on how to do the poses and breathwork and sounds (mantras) that vibrate your body to heal it, strengthen it and give new clarity.  Ana demonstrates the poses (don't be intimidated by how easy she makes things look - just do your best is what I found) and Ravi and Ana explain the physiological basis of how each pose affects your glands, nervous system, muscular system. Brain and energy and spirit.  Ravi has amazing poetry sprinkled in to make it just a beautiful relaxing experience (even though its quite physical!).  The production is very professionally done -- different angles, alternatives if you have certain issues or challenges, music editing, pacing, etc.  I totally recommend any of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's DVD's to anyone whether you do Yoga already or not.  It can truly take your fitness to another level along with your outlook on life.

The workout is demonstrated by Ana while Ravi narrates in voice over format. This is typical of most RaviAna productions.  Those who are RaviAna fans will also appreciate this practice. It is one of their more strenuous productions; however, so I recommend that beginners do this workout in parts and take advantage of recommended modifications. More experienced practitioners of intermediate level or higher will likely be able to complete the entire workout along with Ana. It's possible that more advanced students will find some beneficial challenge, as well.

The setting is bright and music typical of the era for RaviAna productions. It was an enjoyable workout that can provide benefit for bone density and strength development, especially for the upper body. Practitioners would find value in performing the workout in parts or in its entirety. This practice is a nice addition to a RaviAna collection, offering variety from other their workouts, and building strength using kundalini focus and asanas.",1309392000,50,3588,4.703049759229534

Every single muscle gets worked, as well as your nerves, glands, inner organs, and more. Flexibility and strength are equally covered. There's sort of a Down Dog to Up Dog chattaranga sequence which is like a workout unto itself. On all of the Ravi & Ana DVD's they include a lot of great ab work. The demonstration by Ana Brett is inspiring to say the least. She's a real yoga athlete, right up there with Rodney Yee. Their instruction, is perfect. Also, their inspiring little quips stay in my head all day and make me a better person. There is so much to like about this DVD, I could keep writing and writing...",1302048000,5,706,4.48062015503876
2196931,3,B0006VY6JO,"I just bought this DVD, I've never bought anything in this series before, I do a lot of exercise DVDs and programs on ExerciseTV, and I was looking for a new, challenging workout.

I would characterize this as a detoxifying ritual, not a workout routine.  Most of it is a series of one-minute movements with different purposes like detoxifying the liver or opening up the solar plexus. Some of the movements are a bit cardio (like one minute of arm and leg raises), but most are not (like sitting cross-legged, grasping wrists, twisting side-to-side for one minute).  And several are pretty odd (like sticking out tongue and breathing in and out very quickly for one minute, or laying face down, arms at side, and raising and lowering hips very quickly for one minute - glad nobody walked in as I did that one!).

I had no problem with the DVD working properly, or with the music or the voice-over as a few other reviewers mentioned, but I did want to say that this is not an ""exercise routine"" along the lines of YogaWorksBodySlim (my current favorite), Jillian Michael's Yoga Meltdown, Angie Stewart's Yoga Fitness Fusion, or anything like that.  It may be good for overall health and I may do it again on days between other work-outs, but I would not do this as a form of ""exercise"".

Others may disagree, but this is just my two cents worth...",1300320000,7,1347,4.615062761506276
2196932,5,B0006VY6JO,"Warrior Workout is my third Ana&Ravi DVD and is a fantastic workout. I read many of the reviews on Amazon and wanted to add my opinion. This is a very intense and difficult workout but it is fantastic! The focus seems to be on the core and the sciatic nerve with some cardio as well. I have completed the workout in its entirety 6 or 7 times now and can feel myself getting stronger each time. There are two or three of the exercises that I am still having difficulty with but each time I attempt the closer I am to mastering them.
I purchased Beginner's and Beyond in July and I am hooked on these dvd's! I have lost 25 lbs and feel like a whole new person inside and out. I do recommend you start with Beginner's and Beyond if you have never done Kundalini Yoga before you try Warrior Workout.

At first I felt intimidated by the difficulty of some of the poses, but now accept that as part of the learning process.  What I love about Ana and Ravi is their ability to help you to relax and not feel as though you are inadequate if you cannot do every pose.  For this reason I have continued to use their DVD's and have been encouraged to continue with my practice.

I however found this overall workout a little disappointing. I just thought it was okay. Some issues I had with it:

1) Production is really bad on this one. I do have a 37"" hdtv, but the graphics looked way worse than usual.

2) I was super disappointed in the mantra. I personally had a ton of trouble following along and so I felt really disconnected. They took the words off screen pretty fast and I couldn't really make out the words from Ana's singing.

3) Cardio section wasn't too impressive - nowhere near the level of some of the newer stuff. I wasn't exactly huffing and puffing.

4) Same old poses. Warm up had some of the same poses as the cardio.

5) I was a little bored.

The one thing I do like about it is that some of the positions are a bit more challenging and I can see where I can get some use out of it.

Overall, cool to have added to the collection, but I'm just not excited to do this one again like I am with all the other DVDs I have.",1296604800,3,1119,3.986547085201794

What I especially love about this workout:

**Ravi's soothing voice (Note:  I have the pre-matrix version where only Ravi is giving instruction.)

**the focus on breathing.  This yoga workout, more than any other, forces me to really clear my mind and just breathe.  My mind doesn't wander so at the end of the workout, I feel completely renewed and refreshed.

**the perfect blend of breath work, yoga, stretching, light cardio and meditation.  I feel very worked out, yet completely relaxed after this workout.

**the clean white set.  I keep mentioning the set in my latest reviews because in Ravi/Ana's 2009/2010 they use a very fake looking outdoors set that's very distracting.

Some things to be aware of with this workout:

**you should have some experience with yoga before doing this. Ravi gives a few modifications, but not enough for someone completely new to yoga.

**if you're not familiar with the breath of fire or long, deep breathing, you should start with later Ravi/Ana workouts (produced after 2004).  Most of their subsequent workouts have a separate section that guide you through breathing.

A very highly recommended workout for anyone wanting a challenging Kundalini yoga workout.",1280361600,10,1462,5.10126582278481
2196939,5,B0006VY6JO,"This DVD is among the favourites in my collection of Yoga DVD's. By Ana Brett and Ravi Singh who are among my favourite Kundalini Yoga Teachers. The class production is good and accompanying music beautiful.

I find the Warrior Workout to be more of a challenge for me and do the best that I can within my own limits on any given day, I find that each day is different as to what I can achieve..and that is fine.

The class begins with a Tune in via a mantra and then onto the warm up section which I particularly enjoy as I feel that it prepares my body and mind for what is to come next. The sets are next and I really enjoy them, I just do what I can do comfortably and have fun. I like the way that the class flows and how it is structured. There are periods of relaxation/meditation inbetween and lots of encouragement from Ravi and inspiration from Ana. There is a relaxation section and then meditation and finally Tune Out via mantra.

I feel the effects quickly from doing this class, I benefit in many ways and feel calm yet energised and this carries on throughout the day...bliss.

I had practiced Hatha yoga for approx one year before discovering Kundalini Yoga. My main practice is now Kundalini yoga.",1278547200,3,1215,4.386666666666667
2196950,5,B0006VY6JO,"If you are looking for a flow DVD, don't buy this. If you are willing to try something new, I highly recommend it. Like many reviewers have said before, this isn't your typical hatha/vinyasa yoga. I had done (and I still do) a pretty heavy amount of vinyasa-style yoga. New to kundalini, my first RaviAna DVD was Fat Free Yoga and this DVD, both of which I bought based on the reviews. Yes, I was weirded out at first. No, I wasn't sure what was going on with all the ""panting like a happy puppy."" But I liked the focus on breathing, and my abs were sore the next day-- so I stuck with it. Thanks to this DVD (and FFY), I now have some ab definition, which I haven't seen since high school!

I think this type of yoga might be easier/more accessible for men. I have dragged my boyfriend to vinyasa classes, and his hamstrings are so tight that he has to bend his knees significantly in downdog. In general, you don't see a lot of downdog in kundalini, which means he gave it a shot, and he likes it. The DVD proved easy for us to follow right out of the box. The voiceover explains things fairly well. At first, there were a couple times I had to pause the DVD to see what Ana was demonstrating, but the white background makes it very easy to see her positioning.  I like that there are many modifications offered to make exercises easier. Warrior Workout is kind of tough, but it's fun when you notice that you've built up to doing fuller versions of the exercises.

 This DVD is also beginner friendly in that it retains chanting and meditations, but for those uncomfortable with that sort of thing, it reigns in the full on kundalini ""experience"" you get in classes (people in white turbans, talk of the coming of the Aquarian age, etc). Of course, the Ravi Ana DVDs led me to seek out classes, but the DVDs are great for when you are too busy to squeeze in a whole class. I've had this for 6 months and I still use it, which is less than I can say for my dust-collecting Rodney Yee/Jillian Michaels DVDs.  My only complaint is that I wish there was a way to turn off the background music and keep the vocal track.

P.S. A lot of people wonder why she is prancing around in underwear. As one teacher explained to me, she likes it when students wear shorts so that she can see the whole leg and check on their alignment. And as for the crop top, I like that I can see how the stomach is supposed to move when we breathe in a particular way too.",1277596800,8,2446,4.238197424892704
2196951,5,B0006VY6JO,I owned the original version ( without the matrix) and used it so much I decided to spring for the Matrixed version. I love it! Its now set up so you can do just parts and I do a few parts (or the whole thing) every day. Their are some more alignment tips (courtesy of Ana who is simply gorgous with her black hair - though I think the blonde suits her too!). The workout is challenging but a total joy(!!!!!!!!!) and I am so grateful that Ravi and Ana work so hard and creatively to always give their very large fan base such a vast variety of excellent DVDs that are so fun & easy to use! The 3 new ones just arrived in my mail and I am looking forward to learning all the new exercises. WooHoo!,1271462400,4,697,4.0215827338129495
2196952,5,B0006VY6JO,"This is a really great non-stop Kundalini Yoga workout. What I like about Ana & Ravi's workouts is that they are just hard enough but not so fanatic that you're left wondering if it's about you or the instructor. On Warrior Workout, everything gets covered: cardio, abs, arm strengthening, and of course all the spiritual uplift that you would expect from a Kundalini Yoga tape. My favorite thing to do on Sunday mornings is to take a 5 mile run and then do this tape. Ah, heaven!",1271376000,3,480,4.528735632183908

2196954,5,B0006VY6JO,"This is boot camp yoga but in a good way. It's not so hard that you just leave it on the shelf, but not too easy either. The exercises proceed with little or no breaks in between. Everything gets worked on and you feel that you're getting rid of toxins and getting your whole body oxygenated. It's powerful stuff. Afterwards it felt like endorphins were coursing through my system. Also it made me truly feel like a warrior!",1269475200,2,424,4.448717948717949

This is one of my favorite Ana & Ravi DVD's, and I have almost all of them. It's a powerful workout which leaves no stone unturned in its quest to deliver one of the most complete workouts you can imagine: body, mind, & soul. If you think you've seen it all in terms of approaches to exercise, you're in for a surprise. Kundalini Yoga, even though it's ancient, is completely original, and Ana & Ravi have turned it into a viable form of fitness for everyone. This one starts with some warming up and then goes right into a continuous routine which has cardio, strength building, ab work, flexibility exercises, and more. YOU WILL SWEAT. As in most of their DVD's, it ends with a deep relaxation and meditation. Type A personalities will appreciate this for its power and directness and everyone else will appreciate it for its beautiful undertones of Spirit!",1263859200,5,968,4.47457627118644
2196956,5,B0006VY6JO,"I recently got very thrown off my center from life and was craving a nice challenging workout to focus on. This is it! This gets me back on track! I like to work out hard so I really feel like I am making changes to my body and I can really feel how this is working to sculpt my entire body as I work out, and incredibly, while I am focusing on my body - afterward I feel a calm peace like buddah! It's supposedly healthy to at least break a sweat everyday and with this workout I really work up a nice full body ""perspiration,"" so by the end I feel cleansed and detoxified. Lastly, I really like that this is an all inclusive workout - cardio, abs, arms, and all, so I don't need to do anything else. This workout is just right, not so hard that I get sloppy and risk hurting myself, but just tough enough so I know I've done something really good for myself and want to keep coming back for more!",1260835200,4,898,4.050561797752809
2196957,2,B0006VY6JO,"I purchased this DVD based on so many of the positive reviews, but I couldn't have been more disappointed.  The instructional section on breathing was not at all helpful.  The workout itself was boring, and even after completing the whole thing I didn't feel that I had done a workout at all.  I have practiced yoga (mostly Iyengar) for about 10 years, so I do know my way around a yoga mat...there are much better Kundalini DVDs out there.",1260576000,3,440,4.544303797468355
2196958,5,B0006VY6JO,"I really like this workout.  I know some who have reviewed this DVD don't think it's a workout, think it's funny, or whatever, but you do have to open your mind and let it work for you.  If you write it off from the beginning, you'll never benefit from it.

No, it's not like the yoga most of us are accustomed to.  You won't be doing sun salutations.  But change can be a very good thing.  I frankly got tired of hatha yoga because I felt I was doing the same thing over and over again and I was getting bored with it.  I only do Kundalini now.

That said, Warrior is challenging, though not how you might expect.  There is a lot of breath of fire, particularly in the Warrior Cleanse portion of the workout.  It can make your nose burn for a bit, but I always feel great after doing this workout.  It works on several levels.  Warrior is great for flexibility, it has a cardio element, and it requires you to ""keep up,"" as Ana and Ravi always say. It builds endurance in more than just a cardio sense--I would venture that it builds mental strength and endurance, which all of us could use some more of.",1257033600,6,1105,4.20952380952381

I was looking for something a little more ""Do it yourself""-y. Sufficing to say after trying this DVD, I gave up on DVD's. I'm now studying yoga from books as they force me to memorize the postures and lessons, thus I'll no longer have to pay for another DVD featuring 1/4 of the information found in a book.",1256169600,2,483,4.148936170212766

2196983,5,B0006VY6JO,"I thought I would briefly share my experience, along with how kundalini played a role in my subsequent success.

2 years ago I was at a job in which I felt miserable.  I was working on my master's degree, so the job was something to just keep me going through school.  I felt as though my spirit and love for life were being extinguished, but as seems to be the case, when things are dark, quite often beacons of light come your way.

I was coming home every day with a bad headache from all the stress of my job, so I began to practice yoga as a means to relax and transition from a stressful workday.  Ravi and Ana's kundalini dvd's really had a deep impact on me, and suddenly I felt so much more aligned with myself, and the stress at work didn't penetrate as deeply anymore, and over the course of several months, as I ""awakened to my inner self"", I felt I needed to leave that job and find something more fulfilling.

So I left my job without any prospects of something new; I just had a deep feeling that things would work out.  I kept my kundalini practice strong during those uncertain 2 weeks as I approached my last day at that job.  Well, on my last day, I received a job offer from the type of job I had always dreamed about, in the field I was getting my degree in.  To add to that good fortune, I found myself working with other yogis, which was quite unexpected but very inspirational.  I found my place and have been flourishing ever since.

At the end of these dvd's, during the closing meditation, I used to envision myself being happy in the context of no longer being at that miserable job, but these days, I reflect on exactly where I'm at, and how happy I am.

The meditations and self-reflection that Ravi and Ana teach in their dvd's REALLY DO WORK and were instrumental in my transformation, in getting better in touch with myself to feel that the time was right to make that change, and to have the courage and faith to do so.",1251072000,18,1953,4.262872628726288
2196984,5,B0006VY6JO,"Some of the reviews for this don't do this justice. This is one of the most amazing yoga tapes I've ever done and here's why: 1. Kundalini Yoga is the only yoga system which truly has an aerobic component, through its use of breath and  movement. 2. Unlike so many yoga tapes which are a regurgatation of the same old thing, Kundalini Yoga is definitely something new and exciting in the  yoga world. 3. I really appreciate that Warrior Workout is exactly what the titles says. If you're not a Warrior already, it will make you one, not only because of the somewhat intense workout, but because of the philosophy presented in a very relatable way. It's obvious that the authors walk their talk. 4. People don't seem to understand that yoga is more than just physical exercises, it's an inner experience of Self. All of the Ana & Ravi workouts are more than just workokuts, they're an Experience. Bottom line: if you're on the fence about this one, climb over and get this one. You will feel amazing every time you do this!",1250985600,12,1022,4.548913043478261

It's great for reshaping your body, but it goes beyond that and reshapes your sensibility to help you draw on the inner determination and grit to do just about anything. I was very interested in the review below which says this is great for martial arts. I totally agree. I loved the Sarbang Danday Kriya (sp?), which is sort of a Kundalini Yoga version of the Sun Salute. Ana & Ravi explain that Sikh warriors did that 108x, 26x per for those who want something extra, and it delivers! P.S. if you're a beginner or intermediate yoga practitioner, don't let the word Warrior put you off. You'll definitely be able to do this workout.

I have been doing various kinds of yoga for the past 8 years, but have never seen anything like this. I realise that the premise of yoga is to move with your breath, but this took 'breathing' to a whole other level. I found all the 'fire breathing' and jerking backwards and forwards excessive not to mention ridiculous.

Warrior is to mean exactly that...a warrior.  This workout is in a shaman tradition with core power, intent, and balancing of all internal systems.  It you are not familiar with Kundalini Yoga...you may want to try another dvd by RaviAna instead that may be a little tamer...like Beauty Body or Bliss Hips and break yourself into a whole new world of bliss.  Lots of spine flexes in the beginning warmup...an interesting cardio sequence that really gets the heart rate moving.  I especially enjoyed the kriya that begins in down dog, to low plank, to up dog, back to down dog...sounds so basic, but this has a different feel and breath movement...nice.

It was actually one of the first of Ravi and Ana's workouts that I ever did. You can do it as a beginner, it will just be more challenging for awhile.

May seem odd at first but after you do it for awhile you will come to enjoy the great feeling.  I wish I had more time in the day to do them all everyday.

I'm assuming it was tough for me because it targeted areas I've been neglecting in other yoga routines (upper body), and because I needed the detox. After finishing I feel lighter and slightly sore, but invigorated.

This disc has a great balance of the kundalini yoga warmups that I have come to adore, some more traditional hatha yoga poses (down dog into up dog, repeated a few times- OW, my arms!), detox, and meditation. My only gripe is that I couldn't remember the words to the meditation song by the time they were removed from the screen (pausing the disc and jotting them down is my solution, although I had to make sure to print them big enough so as not to distract myself by having to squint).

Ana and Ravi singlehandedly turned me on to kundalini yoga, and my health and mental well-being have really benefited. I lost weight and have toned up! My skin has much more of a glow to it too.

2197024,3,B0006VY6JO,"I'm a huge fan of Ana and Ravi DVDs, but this is really one of my least favorite. The workout is difficult but doable, and that's what matters. On the other hand, Ana's voiceover is particularly annoying in this one, and doesn't make for a great meditative experience. Also, the video is strange -- not skipping, but the timing is off, which makes it pretty difficult to follow Ana ""to the rhythm of the breath of fire."" This is also one where they use repeat loops of the voiceovers, which is annoying if you do the video enough. Overall, it's worth buying for the workout and meditation, which are really great, but you're going to have to grit your teeth and bear Ana talking.",1229212800,20,679,4.483870967741935
2197025,5,B0006VY6JO,"While ordering my two favorite ""more traditional"" yoga tapes in DVD form, it was suggested I try Kundalini yoga. I'd never heard of it.  The first time I did the Beginners and Beyond workout I was taken aback, I felt almost giddy. Even though I was alone, I wanted to look over my shoulder and make sure no one had just watched me gyrating, twisting back and forth, and trying to chant along with Ana and Ravi.  I was strangely elated, and hooked. Instead of using all traditional static posing, Kundalini yoga often uses repetitive movements to warm and stretch your muscles. I love watching Ana.  I really like that it is just her, one-on-one. Ravi has a wonderful, mesmerizing voice. When I complete my workout, not only do I feel more limber and relaxed, but Ana and Ravi send you on your way with a little piece of joy tucked inside yourself.  I now have Fat Free Yoga, Ulimate Stretch Workout, Navel Power, Warrior Workout and Dance the Chakras. I can't wait to buy their latest CDs.  I have given them as gifts to my daughters and two of my friends. Need I say more.",1228262400,8,1073,4.454081632653061

Yes, it is definetly challenging but so worth it in the end. I get a great full body workout as well as a mental workout. I absolutely love how they show you modifications as well as tell you not to overdue it. The meditation at the end is fantastic. After completing the workout I keep the meditation in my head all day and I find it keeps me calm.

I've done the whole gym scene, classes, running, walking, diets, etc. None of that made as much of a change in my body and overall health and well being as these have. I've already lost inches and pounds in only two months, I haven't seen myself at this weight in years!!

It also works on your mind and soul, Ana and Ravi are always so encouraging and inspiring. You will find yourself calmer, more focused, happier, and at peace.

I love to hear what they say. Their voices are soothing and encouraging and get me to do exercises better then I ever could on my own. When I finish I feel like I have really accomplished something great and feel light and happy. To sum up - this is is a total body workout in 55 minutes, for that I really love the DVD.

It requires strength, flexibility and focus, so the level is more geared towards intermediate and advanced audiences, but there are some modifications shown for beginners. The sequences are well designed, and the chaptering makes it easy to create your own workout. The warm-up is deceiving: it starts lightly and then catches up fast.

This is a kickin' Yoga DVD! From this laymans point of  view, it seems to include everything - muscle strengthening, cardio, stretching and more. This is Power Yoga - Kundalini style, in other words, the best of Hatha plus (I've since been learning a lot about Kundalini Yoga). Additionally, I like to use the matrix option because, sadly, I often don't have the time to do a whole hour of Yoga.

There are some poses in which you do breath of fire standing on your toes with arms raised up. Another is downdog on fingertips and toes. Quite challenging but realy creates greater endurance. I don't recommend it for begginers. All the body is addressed and you can feel it. This one will up your physical condition and willpower. As always you are told how the pose is benefitting the body.

I had never done so much as a Kundalini move before until I read the reviews on one of their many DVDs and purchased it. I have now a total of 3, this one is almost my favorite, and I have built up my stamina to where I can do an entire hour of this exercise, compared to only 10min as I was getting used to breath of fire.

My only wish is that there were more of an instruction on exactly how to do breath of fire at the beginning of this DVD or any other one. I found out from talking to a yoga teacher friend that I was indeed focusing on the wrong part of the breath - it is a short in-breath and very intense out-breath and I was doing the opposite.

Watching Ana can only show you so much and the mechanics of the breathing could be better explained, just food for thought for Ana and Ravi who are otherwise magnificent. Thank you for the much bliss that I am now able to create by the Warrior Workout.",1204502400,19,1051,4.0

So, what was so difficult.  To start off I'm overweight FYI, and while not inflexible I'm no yoga buff, gymnast or dancer.  You have to hold this back bend what seems like forever and rotate in and out of it for example.  There are down dogs and they are so slow.  Holy cow.  And unlike my other two dvd's from Ana I have; Chakras, and house call, not much meditation inbetween the moves.  This one is more intense so if holding some gumby like positions is no problem for you and breath of fire simultaneously is your cup of tea, than drink up.

As for me, I'm keeping the DVD as something to work up to. An, ""I have arrived to the top of the yoga mountain DVD.""  Those backbends were such a killer, unbelievable.  My triceps were simply screaming.  Pilates was much easier than this by the way.

For those who'd like a comparison the warrior is a ten in effort compared to chakras (3) and house calls (2).  I guess they don't call it the warrior for nothing.",1198627200,23,1155,4.210045662100456

I love Ana and Ravi's instruction and cannot do this video too many times.  It is very invigorating.  You will begin to notice results in your additude and your body immediately.

Ravi's instructions are unobtrusive, yet extremely informative, allowing you to fully understand why you are doing what you are doing and how it will improve you. Ana is a pure inspiration and motivates me to 'take it to the next level'.

And at the end of the tape is a lovely song/chant. It makes me so happy. I will even just put on that part of the dvd after other yoga workouts because it's so uplifting.

It is a mild form of cardio that feels much healthier to my body then all that hard stepping up and down and running that I had been doing  I have been amazed to see I have finally started losing weight and actually seeing some muscles in my arms legs, back and stomach - all former problem areas.

I started doing Ana & Ravis DVDs in 2001. When I started I could not sit cross legged on the floor without pain, nor could I touch my toes without bending my knees. Now I am very flexible and have obtained a deep strength that feels more integrated then what I used to achieve through weights and running.

This workout like all of the Ravi/Ana workouts is exhilarating! It is probably their most advanced so I recommend starting with their Beginners and Beyond although,if you, like I was, are attracted to the Warrior title I say give it a go.

I believe in rotating workouts, to keep the metablism humming and mind/body energy high, so I use Warrior Workout or Navel Power when I want to burn calories and tone and their Ultimate Stretch Workout when I want a workout that focuses on flexibility. I also sometimes alternate with other workouts like Iyengar(Suzanne Deason) even Baron Baptiste(power vinyasa).

If you are fairly new to Kundalini Yoga I would start with Yoga Total Tune Up which is a particular favorite of mine, in place of Warrior, or Beginners & Beyond. You can't go wrong with any of their workouts for a full body workout that will leave you feeling great.

Ravi Singh is very adept at cultivating inner peace while Anas energetic and impeccable moves lead you through an invigorating workout.

So needless to say, I own (and have watched) many, many, many fitness videos (including many yoga ones.) I've stuck primarily with hatha and asthanga yoga in the past, so Kundalini is new to me. This is the first Kundalini video I've seen and I must say I loved it. To start, the quality of the video is great-the voiceover by Ravi is good, the set is simple and calming-not distracting, and I loved the music. The instruction is great. I wasn't left questioning how to do anything and I wasn't confused. I was able to follow along even though I'm new to Kundalini. I also loved how invigorating it is. I've recently given up all my other forms of fitness such as running and biking to stick with yoga (due to aches and pains). I find myself craving something more vigorous even after my power yoga sessions. This definately was not as hard core as running, but I felt unbelievable afterwards. I wasn't huffing and puffing or all red and sweaty, yet I felt as if I satisified my need for a more cardiovasular workout. It's perfect also, because I didn't have to worry about risk of injury or the aches and pains as I did with running.

My favorite part was the meditation song at the end. I was humming it all day which kept me smiling and relaxed. I felt so great after this video (and all day long) that I'm eager to get to bed at night because I can't wait for morning when I can do it again!! I've also bought all the other Ana Brett and Ravi Singh DVD's that they've made!! Compared to all my other yoga and dance videos, this is by far my favorite!!",1140652800,35,1640,4.256410256410256
2197095,5,B0006VY6JO,"First I have to comment on the previous review which got me to write this in the first place. The sound on my Warrior DVD is fine, better then most. It sounds like she has a problem with her player.

The concept of the Warrior is a big part of the Kundalini yoga tradition. This tape really helps you feel centered, strong and confident.

It starts with some warmups for the spine, stretching, and then goes into a very vigorous routine that is as aerobic as anything I have seen in the yoga realm.

This is a great all purpose DVD for total body conditioning, stretching and balancing.

I think this could be helpful for anyone, whatever their fitness needs.",1135123200,27,659,4.466666666666667
2197096,5,B0006VY6JO,Ok..Just when I thought I was moving to an advanced level in my practice a dvd comes along that kicks my butt! This one certainly did. I loved the variations of the poses and was glad to see that there were asanas that were not on my other dvd's. I am so tired of the Sun Salutation that is on other work outs. I have always had trouble with the lunge part of that set and this dvd cuts that part completely out. THANK YOU! It was a refreshing and tough workout and I am glad I bought it! Will be a nice complement for my other dvd's when I need to really get moving.,1130198400,13,567,3.9391304347826086
2197097,5,B0006VY6JO,"i first tried yoga when i was 17, 7 years ago. loved it, but it didn't last cuz i was not ready.. now i have been doing yoga on and off for two years, and pilates about one year.

i always felt like something was missing, like i was waiting for a deeper fullfilment in my body and mind. i love jennifer kries pilates, but have never been truly satisfied with yoga classes and dvds, all though i feelt a ""yoginis high"" after doing yoga. . i never felt i had the will power to continue yoga,

but this has changed after trying kundalini yoga. in addition, i feel that this type of yoga helps the seksual energy. -to release tennsion and anxiety - and channal it into personal power

After bying this dvd for a friend on her birthday, two friends and i sat down to watch the dvd. we became emotional and high, just by watching the beautifull ANA BRETT and listening to the mantra song.. after trying this dvd my back has never felt stronger( like many others i have had lower back and shoulder problems) this sounds a bit cheesy and woo woo, bUt i FEEL LIKE I AM ""HOME""!

when i listen to, and sing the mantra ""HARE GOBINDAY"" i cry. for the first time i feel like i am doing something that both makes my body stronger and more beautifull, my mind more focused and my soul more powerfull!

i recomend this to anyone who needs o boost of energy, a re-connection to your ""Self"", and a great workout all in one.

ps. i just love ana and ravi, ""all power to you"" for bringing this great yoga to us all !",1117238400,29,1495,4.173611111111111
2197098,5,B0006VY6JO,"I have practiced kundalini yoga for years, but moved away from my teacher and started practicing other diciplines including Qi Gong, power Yoga and Anusara My boyfriend bought the  Warrior Workout DVD along with several others from various sources to help him with his back. I put this one in to check it out and WOW!! I love it!! Definitely the best yoga video

I've experienced. Truly an enlightened work! Now I'm hooked, this workout is helping develop my body and energy system in amazing ways! THANK YOU!!",1112918400,10,510,4.784090909090909
2197099,5,B0006VY6JO,"I have an eclectic background of Tae Kwondo, Chi Kung, Hatha Yoga, Transcendental Meditation and Kundalini Yoga.  Embracing the mental and physical aspects of Kundalini Yoga took some time for me, but videos as the 'Warrior Workout' make the process far easier.  I couldn't disagree with our Minnesota reviewer more, then again we are all entitled to our own prejudices.  Note, this video isn't the best choice for a beginner.  The sequence can be a bit challenging, but it's a level of fitness and flexibility worth striving for.  This set seems to hit all the major systems (lymphatic, cardiovascular, circulatory) along with calming the nervous system.  Grab a copy!",1112486400,41,669,5.091743119266055

Since I started practicing their yoga, when I walk around, I feel light, I feel air flow in my body, my chest is open, I am flexible.  After this DVD, I feel as if I have taken a lovely nap. My face looks fresh! My voice is different. What a lovely thing to do for yourself each day!!

I have most of their other stuff. I have never ever stuck with any practice as long as I have stuck with Ravi Ana DVDs. Godsend. I hope these two are blessed -they have truly enriched the world with their work:)",1491350400,4,570,4.071428571428571
8043701,5,B0006VY6JO,"I loved the way this DVD attacks the lower body and chakras.  This is the foundation of kundalini yoga.  It also allows blessings of abundance come into your life more easily .  If you failed in relationships, business etc.  This will give you the power to break through all obstacles in your way.  Releasing that lower body stiffness will allow more power and this is a workout not for beginners.

I've tried other Ravi Anna  DVD's  but this one is the missing link I was looking for.  If nothing seems to be working for you in your life, try this one.  You can't go wrong and it will give you the power to become successful in all your endeavours.  I'm on my way from relieving fear of success . I'm giving myself 40 days to make a major change in my life.",1465948800,9,758,4.267605633802817
