I know that no movie is perfect, so the reviews that have pointed out some MINOR descrepancies between fact and fiction aren't really that big of a deal in the long run.  This isn't an Oscar contender, but it isn't trying to be.  This is a good action movie that also has enough of a plot that you care about the characters and enough humor to break any tension for those that don't like action all that much.  So this might be a win-win for date night! lol",1358380800,,624,4.254237288135593

I personally know Colombia. There are very nice people so developed cities with technological architectures. Bogota is a huge city with about (8'000.000) eight millions of population without presence of the guerrilla, in this movie Bogota appears like small insecure town. This movie was filmed in Puerto Rico, never in Colombia. I don't know how the director of this movie put Colombia against to United States when actually is the first ally of U.S.A government in South America; furthermore, the ARMY of Colombia and U.S.A interchange soldiers each other.

I think that this movie should be more respectful with Colombia because for some people who never have visited that nice country, could get a bad idea.

Factual errors: Toward the beginning of the film, the lieutenant before walking into the commanders office was saluted by a sailor. Per regulation, neither sailors nor Marines salute indoors while uncovered (not wearing their uniform cover (hat)). At the beginning of the film, Kevin Derricks was identified as a Chief Petty Officer. At the end he is wearing a Petty Officer Second Class uniform. People speak Spanish with a Puerto Rican accent not Colombian, when the movie supposedly is inspired.
I hadn't seen the first two films in the Behind Enemy Lines series and really had no desire to. Besides;I couldn't watch this movie in my computer so it is made in a bad format.",1232668800,3,1466,5.02880658436214
