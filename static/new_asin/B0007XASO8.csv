8053119,5,B0007XASO8,"This DVD is contains a wealth of information on catching, preparation, and special equipment usefull for lobster diving. It is a ""must"" for any diver trying to learn how to sucessfully catch lobster.  I wish it had been out 35 years ago.  It took me many years and lots of dives to learn how to catch bugs and now all that information is available for less than $20.00.  I bought one just to help teach my friends when I take them bug diving.",1115337600,,442,4.301204819277109
8053120,5,B0007XASO8,"Owning all (I think?) of Barsky's consumer oriented books and videos, I have to say this DVD maintains the same exceptionally high standards as his other offerings.

Being a long time diver and bug hunter, I bought this DVD hoping to glean some secret insight into how to locate lobsters more consistently, like depth, weather and tides, etc. Alas, it wasn't to be, although I did learn a thing or two about technique and equipment.

Viewing the video merely confirmed what I'd already suspected. If anyone really knew this information, they'd be catching limits of lobster every day. And no one does that because no one knows that information because lobsters are always on the move.

Keep up the great work, Barsky!",1115337600,,717,4.860655737704918
8053121,3,B0007XASO8,"The quality of this DVD is very good.  However, my one issue with it, is at a whopping 40? something minutes or so, it is extremely lite on any content.  They cover the basics, but really don't put much of their personal experience into it.  For example, they really don't cover what people's experiences have been like.  If I'm a novice, what should I expect?  How deep should we dive for these guys, any other clues to indicate what are good times ( weather, tides , etc. ) to go hunting for lobster.  On the other hand I do thank these people for making a DVD for such a niche market.  This must have been a labour of love, and not a high budget movie for profit venture.",1115164800,,674,4.21875
