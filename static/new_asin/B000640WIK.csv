8038092,2,B000640WIK,The horse who plays Gallant Bess is fantastic. Everything else about the film is not. Not only is this a poorly written and acted film but the quality here is really bad -- scenes seem to be missing. Perhaps one day the film will be restored -- but is it really worthwhile to restore such a bad film?,1496361600,,300,4.189655172413793

8038094,1,B000640WIK,"Don't bother getting this one - not even as popular and this movie is boring and a little light and no interest at all in it - - - don't ever waste your money on this one as I am not at all interested in riding bucking broncos and are not at all a very popular rodeo event, because breaking horses was a lot of work, so, broncos are more likely in Wild West shows and ranch rodeos and rodeos are mostly and more likely to have only calf roping (cowboys and cowgirls), steer wrestling and even, Brahman bull riding (cowboys and cowgirls) as those are the only three most popular contests that the cowboys and cowgirls only ever need in real rodeos, and also, again, real saddle bronc riding and bareback bronc riding is mostly and only in Wild West shows and also, ranch rodeos, as bull riding is more popular in rodeos, as rodeo's only roughstock event ever, as the real true done deal, and that's how people need to agree and take my advice on this one, as if this is going to be the real true done deal, if anyone doesn't get mad or upset about this, got it????

I'll just want to note to all of you to say that it doesn't hurt to just think about rodeo's original event steer roping (before calf roping replaced it), because I like calf roping better and the calf roping is more popular and also, for these reasons, many states banned steer roping, because of some cruelty and some killed and also, are sometimes too big to tie in the manner used for calves and even very difficult for one person to restrain a grown steer once down. However, the steer's ""trip"" causes it to be temporarily incapacitated allowing its legs to be tied in a manner akin to calf roping. The event has roots in ranch practices north of the Rio Grande, but is no longer seen at the majority of American rodeos. However, calf roping became the real popular true replacement as the real true great done deal, as for real true rodeo style roping, as today, calf roping is now actually steer roping, as calves that don't have horns is still steer roping, as that's true for people who need to only stick with calf roping as calves are more easier to lasso and catch around the neck or head as the real true great done deal, as that's what I like about calf roping, instead of steer roping, as it's OK in calf roping, if some calves do have a little bump or horns starting to grow and come out, because yes, CALF ROPING IS STEER ROPING, as I really want people to believe and just think that roping a young steer really requires catching and restraining young steers for branding or medical treatment, as calf roping is almost like steer roping, but, again, calf roping is steer roping, but, calves are definitely easier to rope and I (me, William MacLeod) used to try and think about trying to steer rope some, and I roped calves secondary, so I quit steer roping in 2002 and 2014 and just rope only calves as the real ture done deal, as I'm just glad that I was going in the right direction with just the calf roping and really had just decided to forget and quit the steer roping and just feel blessed to only rope just the calves as the real true done deal, as I'll still rope at the Calgary Stampede when I am at the age of 99, forever, ever and ever.

If people are looking for this movie on the website, here's the plot summary that should really talk about the movie and this would go:

On orders from their boss, rodeo owner Bud Millerick, cowboys Ted Daniels and Woody capture a magnificent wild horse, which Ted names ""Bess"" after a red-headed woman he knew in Amarillo. Later, after Ted sees Millerick mistreating his horses, he quits the rodeo and takes Bess with him to a job on a ranch. Ted teaches the horse several tricks, but eventually the ranch foreman fires him for spending too much time with Bess. While riding into town, Ted spots a poster for Millerick's rodeo - The Real Timed Event Championship. He renews his friendship with Woody and, as Millerick looks on, has Bess perform some of her tricks. Ted enters the rodeo contest of The Timed Event Championship, hoping to win the $250 prize money. After Ted wins the calf roping event, Millerick instructs his henchman Blake to sabotage his next event by oiling the horns of the steer Ted is to catch in the bulldogging event. Ted wins but passes out shortly thereafter and is taken to Dr. Ed Gray, who examines him and informs him he has multiple fractures of the leg. Back at the rodeo, Millerick tries to make Bess do her tricks but she will not cooperate and escapes into town, where she breaks saloon and car windows. She is eventually caught and locked up in a stable by the sheriff. In the meantime, Dr. Gray treats Ted's leg, placing it in a temporary cast. As he will also have to spend some time in a wheelchair, Dr. Gray's daughter Penny arranges for him to stay with her and her father. Ted learns that Millerick left town without paying him the prize money, and as Ted has no money to pay for all the damage wrought by Bess, the sheriff is obliged to sell the horse at a public auction. Ted asks Penny to attend the auction to find out who buys Bess. Millerick sends Blake to bid for the horse, and he is successful, but refuses to tell Penny the new owner's name. Ted is upset with Penny until her father tells him that she tried to buy Bess for him. Ted apologizes and explains about his relationship with Bess. From Penny's description of the man, Ted concludes it was probably Blake. Later, while Millerick incorporates Bess into his rodeo show, the still recuperating Ted becomes becomes close with Penny. One day, while out in the hills exploring an old cabin her father owns, they kiss. Ted tells Penny that he is leaving soon and, although he doesn't want to be tied down, intends to come back with Bess. Ted finds the rodeo and watches Millerick work Bess in her routines with the aid of a nail-studded crop. When Millerick reminds Ted that he bought Bess fair and square, Ted accuses him of swindling him out of the horse and the prize money. Ted and Millerick have a fistfight, which Ted is about to win when a police officer intervenes. Ted escapes in Woody's old car and Bess runs after them. When they stop to make minor repairs on the car, Bess almost catches up with them, but Woody spots her and, not wanting to be involved with a ""stolen"" horse, drives off. Woody drives so fast that the car's wheels fall off and Bess catches up. A police car then approaches and they hide Bess, but when the deputy mentions that there is a $500 reward for Bess's return, Woody whistles in astonishment and Bess, thinking she is being summoned, trots out from hiding. Woody and Ted try to trick the deputy and attempt to claim the reward money. However, the deputy takes Bess into town, hitched to the rear bumper of his car. As Ted and Woody walk on, Bess escapes from the deputy and finds them. They head back to the cabin, where Ted informs Woody that he is going to settle down. Woody tells him that Millerick will find him and that they should never have taken Bess from her herd in the first place. When Penny comes to the cabin later, Ted proposes marriage. In town, Woody spots Millerick and Blake in town and warns Ted. Later, Woody tells Penny that Ted has left to return Bess to the wild. Millerick and Blake follow him, but Ted manages to lose them and turns Bess loose in her ""home"" herd. Millerick and Blake go after Bess, but Ted chases after them, knocks Blake out and saves Millerick from being stomped by Bess. Finally defeated, Millerick gives Ted the bill of sale for Bess and Ted tears it up. In the confusion, Bess runs off, and Ted returns to the cabin and tells Penny that Bess is back where she belongs. Ted discovers, however, that Bess has chosen to return to the cabin's corral and to them.

So, this movie is a little light, and again, the rodeo was a timed event championship rodeo that featured only calf roping and bulldogging (which is rodeo's real true two main events) as rodeo - calf roping and steer wrestling, as if it looks like of how the title of Timed Event Champion is highly coveted, as to win the real title you have to bulldog 5 steers and rope and tie 5 calves... not to mention, beat the clock, as the event takes place each year in March at the Lazy E Arena in Guthrie, OK, as the 20 top all-around cowboys and also, 20 great cowgirls in calf roping are really invited to give it their best shot! It's also called the IRONMAN COMPETITION and IRONWOMAN CALF ROPING COMPETITION...and with good reason, as again, the 20 invited contestants must rope 5 calves and steer wrestle 5, as the fastest one in the real true great timed events of calf roping and steer wrestling becomes the Timed Events Champion of the World, as calf roping and steer wrestling are the real true specialties of rodeo's real timed events as the real true done deal, as people need to agree and just take my advice on this one, got it???????

Not this movie anyone would hope for, as I would not buy this movie at all, NEVER, as I'll just want to note to all of you to say that this is really one that any all-around or timed event competitor might enjoy, maybe for the Timed Event Championships, but again, this movie is really not one that any John Wayne fan would really want to own forever and ever, so me and other people will really just for sure pass on it and everyone needs to stick with John Wayne, because for actual real people who should think about all their real rodeo heroes have always been cowboys, I think anyone should really totally pass on this one with my advice and also, even the same for ""Trouble in Texas"" starring Tex Ritter and ""Frontier Town"" starring Tex Ritter were also all boring and a little light, as also, not everyone would have interest in those Tex Ritter movies and Gallant Bess, so, I would just stick with ""The Man From Utah"" and ""The Desert Trail"" with John Wayne, because everyone had more interest in John Wayne, because he was more popular to me, and this is going to be the real true done deal.

Also, because so, many other real rodeo people and John Wayne fans are more too busy watching the real western cowboy and rodeo movies of all of every one of all of John Wayne's western movies and also, those top real true greatest done deal of the top greatest and best 20 movies with the rodeo and all of every one of all of John Wayne's western movies will really totally kick into high gear as the real true done deal, so, forget about the Gallant Bess and Tex Ritter movies and just think about one person of mostly calf roping, so just stick with those real top 20 movies of rodeo that I recommended to be the real best and the greatest for every rodeo and John Wayne fan to keep on watching each and everyday all the time when rodeoing as the real true main events of calf roping, steer wrestling and bull riding are rodeo's three real main events for all the cowboys and cowgirls of every rodeo, because again, everyone need's to really take William MacLeod's (my) real advice and should just stick with my real true-done deal, just stick with the old Duke, Mr. John Wayne (the Duke) because he's the right cowboy for me and the right cowboy for everybody else, because here's only the real top 20 best movies with rodeo that I would totally recommend of all-time for everyone else like me to keep on watching over, over and over again for real rodeo people to watch over, over and over again that have clips of calf roping, steer wrestling and bull riding are:

Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack (bull riding and steer wrestling)
Cowgirls N' Angels (a movie for sure that has breakaway roping, steer wrestling and bull riding)

Those are the only movies of rodeo that people need to take and agree with my advice on to just rope and tie down calves and quit the single steer roping, because again, CALF ROPING IS STEER ROPING, and then again, I would really just keep on recommending to anyone who loves real rodeo and real John Wayne (the Duke), plus along with rodeo, be sure to watch all of John Wayne's westerns of ""McLintock!"" and other western movies John Wayne is in, as well, too, got it, as those are the real true tales of the real American west and rodeos, because in the future, there might be other movies released that may also have rodeo, as well, too, but those are the real ones that are the real must for any rodeo cowboy's library and those I would definitely recommend to all rodeo cowboys, rodeo cowgirls, rodeo calf ropers, rodeo steer wrestlers, rodeo bull riders and even also, John Wayne (the Duke) fans, as well, too, so, here's hoping that you and other rodeo people will watch those real top 20 of all-time from the past, present and future, forever, ever and ever as those are the ones that I think people will need to see over, over and over again all the time because those are the great ones of calf roping, steer wrestling and bull riding, and that's the real true done deal, OK??????????",1392336000,,15364,4.861450381679389
8038095,5,B000640WIK,"Had seen this movie many years ago, and loved it so much, but have never been able to find and view it again. Now I have it to watch whenever I like. Great story.",1384387200,,162,3.7941176470588234
8038096,4,B000640WIK,"I watched this movie so many times as a child, and it fueled my love of horses.  It is partly responsible for all the ""Bess's"" I have enjoyed and for the mustang mare I still have. The film combines a Black Beauty theme with the old fashioned corny westerns that made us all want to be cowboy heroes.  It shows a great horse at the mercy of the humans who care for her, hopefully teaching compassion for animals to young minds.  ""Bess"" is a beautiful, well  trained, entertaining horse, who upstages everyone else anyway.  I thought this movie had disappeared long ago since it's hardly a box office hit and was delighted to find it again. Caution: may inflict the ""horse bug"" in impressionable viewers! :)  The ""other"" Gallant Bess, based on a true war story was great also, but haven't located that one.",1166832000,3,805,4.555555555555555
8038097,5,B000640WIK,I love horse movies and this always touched my heart in a special way. It is truly one of my favorite horse movies!!!!!!,1139011200,3,120,4.260869565217392
8038098,2,B000640WIK,"Ted Daniels (Cameron Mitchell) captures, tames and trains a special wild horse that he names Gallant Bess. When Ted gets injured and incapacitated, Bess is stolen from him and he has to decide whether to pursue her - or to stay where he is a pursue the doctor's lovely daughter (Audrey Long) instead. Adventures of Gallant Bess is not to be confused with the more popular, better-remembered Gallant Bess, a movie that was released in 1947. This movie is an OK Western, but not the horse movie you may be hoping for (Gallant Bess, the other one, is about a soldier who finds a horse during WW2).
