2861460,5,B000R7I3YQ,"As goes within the realm of comedians, it is blatently apparent that Demetri Martin is one of the unknown, and unsung heros of our generation.  coming from obscurity, his extremely dry and witty form of humor is acceptable for all ages, whilst retaining a semblance of its adult draw.",1199664000,,284,4.795918367346939
2861461,5,B000R7I3YQ,My son ordered this dvd for his older brother for Xmas and we all watched it together and we all enjoyed the different comedy approach. We had seen him perform on the comedy channel and that inspired my son to order it for his borther,1199059200,2,234,4.222222222222222
2861462,5,B000R7I3YQ,"Demetri Martin is an extremely funny young comic who doesn't need the rants, raves, and fast-paced nonsense that other comics use in their acts.  Demetri creates big laughs from a look or short quip.  His comedy enlists the audience member to think, not just react to some wild provocation.  He fills the niche of subtle humor not tapped enough in this fast=paced world.  He is fantastic.",1194998400,8,388,4.833333333333333
2861463,5,B000R7I3YQ,"Demetri Martin could be the funniest person ever to exist. Literally. I have shared this DVD with several of my friends, and he quickly became their favorite, as well.
His humor is genius, as is he. You will laugh throughout this entire DVD, including the extra footage. The best part about his comedy is that so much of it is commentary on everyday objects and occurrences. This means that long after you've watched the DVD, you'll find yourself replaying his jokes in your mind as you witness the truth behind his observational humor manifested before your very eyes. I mean, who hasn't had the experience of being betrayed by their drinking straw? Don't think this describes you? Watch and learn. It does.",1194652800,5,708,4.811475409836065
2861464,2,B000R7I3YQ,"A let down, a disappointment, a failure.

If you've had a taste of Demetri's work on the Daily Show and want more, then you'll probably enjoy this, though not as much as you might expect.  Demetri's Trendspotting on the Daily Show hinted at absurdist comedic genius.  His 'These are Jokes' CD went a ways to confiming this view for me - but this DVD is a regression.  The principle downfall is that so many of the jokes are repeated from the CD.  The repetition suggests either a shallow talent or a cynical attempt to leach more $$$ from unwary admirers (it worked!).

The extras are weak and the show is remarkably short and stuffed with filler - strange animated ruminations on mythical mythical creatures.

Buy 'These are Jokes' instead, its a superior, less contrived offering that covers more material for less $$$.",1193356800,7,821,4.73943661971831
2861465,5,B000R7I3YQ,"Demetri Martin is a true comic genius.  Not only does his jokes make you laugh, they also make you think.  It is what I would like to call 'Smart Comedy'.  So if you like to laugh then check out this guy, you will not regret it.",1191628800,3,228,3.9130434782608696
2861466,4,B000R7I3YQ,"Demetri Martin's low-key, child-like comedy is an awful lot of fun to watch.  One part Zach Galifianakis, one part Mitch Hedburg and with a dash of early Pee Wee Herman on Ritalin, Demetri performs as though he's a talented but strange kid putting on a show for his parents.  Through stand up (""I like to stand around ATMs, wait until someone punches in their PIN number and say, 'Got it!"" and run away.""), odd train of thought music, graphs and pie charts of observations he's made (""This graph represents how cute a girl is vs. how long I'll listen to her talk about how intuitive her cat is...""), ""Art"", and even some animation, it's laugh out loud hilarious and worth watching twice.

  Criticism?  The stage play of ""Where my comedy goes"" could have been cut, or at least cut down.  It's amusing, but goes on a bit too long, hence, I give the DVD 4 instead of 5 stars.  An excellent show by perhaps the next superstar comic!",1188864000,22,929,4.488095238095238

While not as politically or socially conscious as his work on the Daily Show or Last Week Tonight (nor were we expecting it to be), it's still a great series of thoughts and observations with his wonderful British humor.

2861617,5,B000R7I3YQ,"Okay, I'm going to see how much I can say without saying too much.  It's difficult, I think, to properly review a standup CD or DVD because you can't really say anything more than `this is really funny' without giving away punch-lines and thus ruining the experience of the reader.  Comedy needs to be experienced in order to be fully appreciated, especially standup, because it's the being unaware of where the comedian is going that effectively elevates the experience.

So, I want to say that this is REALLY, REALLY funny.

I will say a little more than that though.

Demetri Martin is a very unique comic.  Instead of standing in place and telling a series of jokes he strums his guitar and plays the piano and shows you a series of pictures he drew himself, as well as some cartoon's he inspired.  He sings you a couple songs and yes, he tells you a lot of jokes.  To say that it's all about the delivery is an understatement.  Not only does Martin have that deadpan delivery that makes his humor all the more effective, but he manages to couple it with the right amount of setup to make it truly laugh-out-loud hysterical.

So it's like delivery + scenery.

His art section is my personal favorite.  It's so obvious it's funny.  His closing number, the musical reenactment of `where his jokes go after he tells them' is utterly hilarious.  Even my wife, who is not easily amused by standup, found this particular song to be one of the funniest things she's ever seen.  Martin makes you laugh with everything he does.  Even a ginger stroll across the stage to retrieve his harmonica can cause the viewer to burst out in laughter.

And get this, he's not offensive.

Okay, so I have nothing against an offensive comic (I really LOVE Daniel Tosh, and he is like the king of the dirty joke) but it's nice when a comic can be funny without pushing the envelope.  Martin doesn't feel the need to push your buttons, for he has a knack for finding the funny in things that any and everyone can listen to without squirming.  There are a few expletives peppered in here but nothing so extreme that the entire family can't enjoy this.

The extras are also a nice bonus, complimenting this Comedy Central special well; especially the commentary track which features Martin's mother, grandmother, uncles and sister.  There is some of is previous work included as well so the viewer can get to know the comic a little more.  What is so great about `Person' is that it is watchable and appeals to multiple viewings.  I've seen it at least seven times and have laughed out loud every time.  It is a DVD to share with friends and family and one you will be talking about for a long time to come.",1234310400,,2684,4.53014553014553

2861619,5,B000R7I3YQ,"This comedy is blunt but also unassuming. Martin gives observations without waiting for the audience to find it funny or relate, he just tells it as he experiences it. Also, his jokes are so accessible to relate to, such as the limit of how long you'll listen to a girl talk about her cat, in relation to how attractive she is. How many times have people tried to talk to you about their cat, or YOU have tried to share pet cat stories, and no one cares either way.

Buy this and laugh and laugh.",1233619200,,496,4.221052631578948
2861620,5,B000R7I3YQ,"""Person"" by Demetri Martin is a brilliant, intelligent, and very low-key stand up routine captured in a cable special, and now available on DVD. The DVD is short (around 40 minutes), but filled with gems. My only serious complaint about the DVD is that there are several previews at the beginning of the disc that you can't skip. Since I paid for the DVD, I resent having to watch ads for stuff I would never in a million years be interested in buying. Once the show starts, though, all is well.

Martin is known for using a guitar extensively during his monologues; here he also adds piano and bells to his act, and all help to produce a seamless and very funny show. The material is all over the map, from observations about linguistics and personal injury (""The easiest time to add insult to injury is when you're signing somebody's cast.""), to a video game, ""Super Busy Hospital"", where you have to take care of the victims shot in all the other video games, and, of course, many uncategorizable bits (""If I ever saw an amputee being hanged, I would just shout out letters."")

There are a couple of short animated links that Martin made which tie segments of the special together. I was especially fond of the inquiry into the deeper life of porcupines, and also enjoyed Professor Irwin Glands discussing less common mythical creatures such as the amoebicorn and the paradoxotaur.

The DVD has many bonus features that more than make up for the short special running time. I liked that Martin did a commentary track with his mom and grandmother: he comes across as a very well-grounded, smart, and funny guy. I especially appreciated that the material here is not lowbrow or dependent on scatological references. If you enjoy intelligent and thought-provoking humor, I highly recommend ""Person"" by Demetri Martin: watch it and discover why glitter is the herpes of craft supplies.",1226620800,2,1884,4.7907692307692304

If you don't know anything about Demetri Martin he's all over youtube.com so check him out, But be careful because if you search too much you'll spoil the DVD.",1212364800,,275,4.63265306122449
2861634,3,B000R7I3YQ,"I always liked Demetri Martin; I thought he's funny, different, and smart. Watching this show though didn't add much. Yes, I laughed the first 10 min, he was as funny as always, but then it was the point of ""now what?""
The Jokes became predictable, and his sketches weren't as smart as before.

I hope he still has more to give and this is only a temporary pause.",1212364800,,363,4.338235294117647

2861637,3,B000R7I3YQ,"Martin is something different for those who like off-beat standup comedy. Don't expect a lot of belly laughs, but instead a more subdued, goofy comedy that appeals to quirky and intelligent types. The artwork sketches, done by Martin himself, are the strongest elements.

If you like guys like Jim Carrey, Martin Lawrence or Carlos Mencia...forget this and look for something else. You won't ""get"" it.",1204416000,3,401,5.1692307692307695
2861638,5,B000R7I3YQ,"I saw Demetri Martin on a comedy central stand-up and my husband and I thought he was hilarious so we bought his DVD. We are so glad we did because this dvd was worth every cent!!!

Martin is absolutely hilarious! He is one of those rare artists who do not use profanity and sexuality for a laugh. Instead is comedy is based on pointing out the obvious but making it funny! He uses charts and graphs that he drew himself, a piano and harmonica, and a guitar. The ""finale"" has people acting out what he is saying in the background. An absolute riot!!!

DEF worth the purchase. Loved it!",1203379200,6,585,4.3577981651376145
