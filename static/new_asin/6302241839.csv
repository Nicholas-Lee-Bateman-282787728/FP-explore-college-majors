7822991,4,6302241839,"This review is not on the movie, but about the ""Up all night"" dvd's that have been showing up on Amazon. Breaking all the rules was my first purchase of one of these dvd-r's. No re-mastering has been done...well maybe a little...the quality is slightly above VHS. But considering that most of these movies wouldn't otherwise be on dvd, then I guess it's a plus that they are even being offered. I will probably buy more of them, because even at vhs quality these movies are great to have. Although, I have to say the price is pretty steep considering they haven't been remastered. (anywhere from $18-22 at the time of this review). The picture quality my differ from movie to movie, and like I said, this is my first ""up all night"" dvd....so we'll see.

On a side note, the ""mom and pop video shop"" dvd's that can also be found on Amazon have pretty decent picture quality. I have no complaints with the few of those that I have bought. Also, the MGM dvd-r are really nice. Nice picture and sound on those.

I hope this trend of digging up old obscure 80's movies to dvd continues. I like finally having the old stuff to watch again.",1371686400,11,1133,4.416267942583732
7822992,1,6302241839,"It took a little while to recieve it and when I did, it was the wrong movie. I got Breaking the rules instead... Im still waiting for the right movie. I hope i will get a response soon and the right movie eventually cause its a classic old school movie.",1348444800,,253,4.08
7822993,5,6302241839,"If you like the 80's you'll love this movie.

The story of a pair of teenagers who meet and fall in love in an amusement park on the last day of summer. All the while outwitting 3 dumb would-be jewel thieves who is in search of the ""Ice"".",1222214400,2,238,3.9583333333333335
7822994,2,6302241839,"Not a bad movie - not a good movie either--
BIG SPOILERS- the whole movie is detailed here,so if you dont
want to know what happens if you have not seen it- don't read!!!
Many people have seen this and have thought of it as retarded-
so it may not be a big problem
About 2 girl and 2 guy teens that hang out together at at Canadian Amusement Park getting to know each other-- and indeed fall in love
But 3 incompetant jewel theives are after a diamond
they hid in a stuffed animal prize at one of the Midway games---
The 3 dumb theives  run into these teens at night-
1 of the 2 teen girls has the jewel in her stuffed animal
that the theives are looking for--
The theives chase these teens around the park to get their diamond back as the teens try to outrun them--
Eventually the 3 foolish theives get caught-
And one of the teens who was indirectly involved
by placing his fingers on the case the jewel was in
is let off the hook-- naturally the cops think he was the theif
cause his fingerprints were on the case the diamond was in-
but he was looking at it- and had no intent to steal it--
but the 3 idiots are the ones who really have it--
and so this movie is a retarded romp through an
amusement park---
Beware-- I watched this when i was 8, or 9 with my brother
with the babysitter when my folks were not home because indeed
there are a few shots of FEMALE ANATOMY that may be
objectional!!!",1072828800,4,1400,4.109489051094891
