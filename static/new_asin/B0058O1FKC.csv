8461901,5,B0058O1FKC,"Matt Hughes at one time was the most dominate welterweight in mma history.  Not only was he a nine time ufc champ but he created the blue print for guys like GSP, Josh Kosckeck, John Fitch etc.  Matt Hughes has compiled an incredible record with an even more incredible finnish record (over 75%). For those just now watching the ufc you will definitely want to check this dvd out.  Matt has some of the best fights not only in welterweight history but also ufc history.  The quality and price on amazon is also excellent.",1334793600,2,521,4.51063829787234
8461902,5,B0058O1FKC,"I didn't know much about Matt Hughes considering that I've only been following the UFC for a little over a year now. However, coming from a strong wrestling upbringing, whenever someone is slammed or power-bombed  in  the Octagon I almost **** myself. This is the kind of fighter that sells tickets and brings in the casual/new MMA fan like myself. Aside from Rampage in his Pride fighting, it's not very often that you see such good wrestling in MMA. I am very pleased with this purchase.",1331769600,2,489,4.674418604651163
8461903,4,B0058O1FKC,"Before a certain French-Canadian came along the UFC's Welterweight division was dominated by one man, Hillsboro farm boy Matt Hughes. While newer fans of MMA might only know Hughes for his recent first round defeats to BJ Penn and Josh Koscheck, they will soon find out why Hughes was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in 2010 as during his two Welterweight Title reigns Hughes was the most dominant Welterweight Champion the UFC has ever seen. Complete with an All American Wrestling Division one pedigree Hughes had lethal ground and pound, big slams and a great Submission game. Finally with this DVD you can watch a Documentary of Hughes life and fighting carear as well as relive some of his greatest fights from the octagon.

The Documentary which runs for over 90 minutes gives the viewer a quick look at Matt's early life growing up with twin brother Mark that would help form a competitive edge, we also hear from his father. The main portion of the DVD looks at Matt's fighting career in the Octagon and has various talking heads such as Trainer and team mate Pat Militech as well as rivals he's faced such as GSP, BJ Penn and Frank Trigg who still deny's any wrong doing in their second title fight and is convinced the fight should have been stopped before Hughes remarkable recovery that see's him pick up Trigg and run to the other side of the Octagon and drop him with a vicious slam and choke him out shortly after. The fact that it's UFC's President Dana White's favorite moment say's it all. Matt admits he considered retiring after his second meeting and second loss to Dennis Hallman at UFC 29 when the UFC fired him. His trilogy of fights with GSP and BJ Penn(he's admits he thought he would defeat Penn easily) are discussed. His meeting against MMA pioneer Royce Gracie get's dissected and is put down to American Wrestling beating Brazilian Jiu-jitsu. For all he's accomplished Matt Hughes would prefer to be remembered as a good christian and family man first and fighter second.

There is 15 fights included, there is 3 on disc one including his Title winning Fight against Carlos Newton. The second disc has 12 full fights including THAT fight against Trigg, as well as an early title defense against Sean Sherk(who was probably undersized to fight at welterweight) which has commentary from Joe Rogan and  fighter Phil Baroni who can't seem to agree on anything during the fight, whilst Planet Jiu-jitsu founder Eddie Bravo scores each round. His first meeting against GSP is included and shows what a good Jiu-jitsu game Hughes has even though he trains it he doesn't do the belt levels. His dominating performances against Joe Riggs, Gracie and Ricardo Almeida are all included as well. The battle of The Ultimate Fighter season 6 coaches is included as well and since Matt Serra thinks he won the fight it's work a look to make up your own mind.

UFC Ultimate Matt Hughes has plenty of action on it as well as a great documentary and at 5 hours long is good value. It's disappointing his second fight with GSP isn't included(not surprising considering he lost) and it would have been nice to hear from more of his former training partners Jermery Horn, Jens Pulver and Tim Sylvia. But there's not much that can be faulted with this DVD release really, the second in the Ultimate series after Royce Gracie. It's great to get a look back at one of the most dominating Fighter and champions the UFC has ever had.",1326326400,2,3441,4.682644628099173
