7050123,5,B00UKO5EYS,"I went into this with vague memories of seeing some of it at my aunt and uncle's swag 70's pad when I was a kid.  They had cable and HBO--my uncle was a stoner, and so there were a lot of reasons for me to want to hang at their place.  They were the COOLEST CATS I knew!  He also had a great stash of porn magazines.  lol

At any rate, there are enough reviews on here for this for me to just say what a totally ASTOUNDING find it is.  I love music, and my taste is all over the place 50's, 60's, 70's, hell, every decade, I'm in!!  What I HATE about ""live"" musical performances is lip sync and air guitar--it really ruins the whole thing for me with very few exceptions (ok, sometimes I do cut someone some slack if they are dancing up a storm, doing acrobatics, etc, but they STILL have to look like their lips are moving to the words.  Michael Jackson was so bad at lip syncing that even the Motown 25 performance that catapulted him to superstardom is hard for me to watch.  It is a great irony that that particular ""performance"" was what REALLY made him a superstar.  It's a great DANCE performance to a recording of great hit song that he happened to write, and there is still magic in it, but it feels like eMpTV to me when I see performances like that, but I digress.

Almost every single performance on the collections of The Midnight Hour that I've bought  is a LIVE, FOR REAL performance, i.e. they are actually SINGING, PLAYING, etc.  Watching them game me pause.  There are songs on here that I've never particularly been a fan of, but that I found thrilling, engrossing, and enthralling to watch live.  The artistry, the fashion of the times, seeing so many solo artists of later years whom I loved, but whom I never knew were in some of these bands before going on to their solo careers, and becoming stars on their own are all fascinating and mesmerizing.  If you watch closely, you can get quite a great education on the family tree of music.  I watch these over and over again, and send them to every fellow music lover and soundphile I know for occasions.  I have blown many a mind with these.  ""Nuff said.",1433980800,2,2125,4.293969849246231

8707276,5,B00UKO5EYS,"This brings back so many childhood memories of staying up late on a non-school night and watching what was popular at the time. This was the original version of Friday Night Videos and MTV. It all started in 1973 on late night television with a show called The Midnight Special. This show featured the best music and comedy of the 1970's and early 1980's. Many modern acts got their starts on this show and owe it their lives. With too many musicians to name here and comedians galore, this will surely bring back memories of the 70's with artists like Heart, Santana, Croce, Steely Dan, Donna Summer, Dolly Parton, and more. Those are just the musicians. This collection also features comedy from the likes of Billy Crystal, George Carlin, Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, and more! If you like everything from REO Speedwagon to Christopher Cross; from Redd Foxx to David Brenner, and MANY more, this is the ultimate collection!",1440806400,6,925,4.823899371069182
8707277,3,B00UKO5EYS,This collection of THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL brings back memories of an appearance by The Who that I'm relieved to see wasn't included here. I was in high school at the time and very much wanted to learn to play a musical instrument but my family couldn't afford to buy one for me. The school did not offer an instrument I could borrow but instead harassed me about it and eventually removed me from the class. I was heartbroken. Then came the night that The Who made their appearance and totally destroyed their instruments on live TV. I thought I would be sick.,1438560000,,558,4.480392156862745
