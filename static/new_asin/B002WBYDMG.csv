4006435,5,B002WBYDMG,"Purchase this set of Dorf, as we have been a Tim Conway fan for many many years. This set was on sale and the delivery time was very fast. The video and audio quality was EXCELLENT for the whole set. Buying this set was a great lesson, you don't have to have crude jokes or crude pictures to make you laugh. This set is for everyone and my 9 year old grandson, laughed so hard he was in tears. We even purchased 2 other sets for gifts and our neighbors loved them. If you are an adult or have kids, this set is a must. We watched them over and over. Good clean fun and laughter. 5 Big Stars on this product.",1308441600,10,607,3.9836065573770494

4006468,4,B002WBYDMG,"Good quality, and I purchased it to relive childhood memories of Tim Conway. I had expected our kids might get a kick out of Dorf, but upon seeing this collection, I was rather surprised at some of Conway's language and adult humor, which is of course very inappropriate for kids. I remember seeing Dorf when I was a kid, but this PG13+ rated content must have been censored back then. I still like Tim Conway, but honestly, how long can an adult laugh at the sight gag of a man standing in a hole up to his knees?",1415577600,,514,4.255102040816326

If I put on normal kids shows like Dora the Explorer, they yell at the TV and try to get me involved in the story lines, such as they are.  Not with DORF.  When I put this puppy on, the kids just sit there and stare at the TV like dumb animals for hours.  I can even put the disc on repeat and the kids won't even notice.  I can't speak for the content of the program, because I haven't been able to watch more than a couple of minutes without leaving the room, but as a babysitter, it's the tops!",1399593600,,569,3.8706896551724137

4006486,4,B002WBYDMG,"as a rule i am anything but a sports fan. at the best of times i find sports tedious, repetative, and just plain pointless. (i have a personal witticism that Hitler was madly in love with the Jews compared to the way i feel about sports.) but i have found that i can sort of enjoy sports by proxy, for as long as it takes for say, Abbott & Costello to perform ""Who's On First"" or John Fogerty to sing ""Centerfield.""
one thing i do love is a good comedic characterisation, and for my money the pinnacle of Tim Conway's repertoire is Scandivaian midget ""athlete"" Derk Dorf. i'm serious: no one will ever confuse the subject matter or the approach with Shakespeare, but in terms of characterisation i legitimately feel that Dorf is to Tim Conway what Ralph Karmden is to Jackie Gleason or Captain Kirk is to William Shatner.
it turns out Conway had some gifts as a scribe as well as a performer, and combining the two, he came up with a nifty spoof of the glut of ""how-to"" videos that came about when the VCR started to become commonplace. that's no doubt why these released were direct-to-video, since the targets of the spoofery were as well.
the initial masterpiece DORF ON GOLF is the most satisfying, boasting a tight script and an outlandish but logical progression of stumbling blocks as Dorf tries to guide us through a single hole. it is also noteworthy for demonstrating the versatility of character actor Vincent Shiavelli. in what some might think a thankless role, that of Dorf's hapless caddy Leonard, Shiavelli brings his inconoclastic style to the stereotype goofball sidekick character.
next up, DORF'S GOLF BIBLE attempts to combine it's predecssor's seamless comedic vision with a parody of religion. it has some pretty good moments, and of course boasts a guest spot by ""Slammin'"" Sam Snead, but on the whole, alas, MONTY PYTHON'S LIFE OF BRIAN it ain't. most disappointing for me, though, is that Leonard couldn't make it, and his role is taken up with a less engaging (not to mention less original) ""nerd"" stereotype character named Waldo, played by Eddie Deezen. he's not a completely unappealling character, and Deezen certainly does what he can with what he has to work with, but he's no Vincent Shiavalli.
episode three, DORF & THE FIRST GAMES OF MT. OLYMPUS, is the second-best installment. not just because Shiavelli's Leonard is back, but that certainly helps. (the most pronounced weakness of the rest of the series is the lack of Shiavelli. he and Conway turned out to have a surprisingly unique chemistry.) the story tells how ancient Greek emperor ""Derkus"" Dorf invented the olympics, and the trials & tribulations he faces along the way.
next up is DORF GOES AUTO RACING. Conway's ambition appears to of gotten the best of him, because (a) it on film rather than videotape, and (b) it is extended from 30-35 minutes to 50 minutes. between the two, AUTO RACING is a little out of kilter with the feel of the rest of the series. although again, that doesn't mean there aren't thing to reccomend it. it offers appearances from such celebrities as NASCAR alum Richard Petty and singer/songwriter Hoyt Axton, who even gets to sing a couple of his songs. and of course i have too pronounced a weakness for puns not to be tickled by the change of name to Doozle Dorf.
DORF GOES FISHING bring the series back to it's original instructional video motif. Dorf has as much skewed fun with fishing as he initially had with golf, but the highlight here is a wonderful parody of home-shopping networks as hosted by Ronnie Schell (best known as Gomer Pyle's fellow marine). still, Conway's performances of caveman Dorf and caricature of Julia Childs don't exactly lag, either.
DORF ON THE DIAMOND (the one from which the ""Superfan"" reference was taken), tells the story of a hapless would-be athlete who continued to enjoy the game (baseball in this case), but never loses his unfeasible dreams of playing it himself. so basically, here Dorf is sort of a grown-up Charlie Brown, with just a pinch of Walter Mitty thrown in for texture.
DORF DA BINGO KING finds our semi-hero hosting a Bingo tournament, with the usual hectic results. not that Dorf himself isn't up to his usual slapdash standard, but again, Conway generously let's another steal the show, in this case a character actress named Louise Duart in a number of celebrity caricatures.
no. 8, however, the story of an elderly ping-pong champion, is as dark a horse as the world has ever seen. to describe THE LEGEND OF THE PADDLE: THE OLDIE HOLLIS STORY as bizarre would be like saying ""being decapitated could really ruin your whole day."" overlooking the surreal story and the downright avant-garde production values, there's the fact that Dorf appears only briefly. if there's a question to be asked beyond what the hell PADDLE is doing here, it's: ""why the hell is THIS the one Conway offers a commentary for?"" Oldie just isn't one of Conway's masterpieces.
the seven which center on Dorf have much to recommend them, albeit in fluctuating degrees. the material is of course set squarely at ""low"" comedy level, but then what would you expect from someone made a household name by The Carol Burnett Show? as i've said before, it seems to be a common theme in my reviews, things people either love or hate.
there are times when it ultimately boils down the question of whether you like the character or not. to those who don't like Dorf, i have this to  say: ""oh well, your loss. everyone's entitled to an opinion. if your's is wrong that's YOUR problem.""",1377216000,3,5532,4.756503642039542
