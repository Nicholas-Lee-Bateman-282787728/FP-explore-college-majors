877526,4,630443507X,"... --this is truly a great little horror picture...one of the most underrated in euro-horror cinema.  It is literally creepy and the unravelling of the narrative is way more mysterious and thrilling than ""Pet Sematary"" which later covered  some of the same territory.  Unfortunately, when this film was originally  released on video in the US it was retitled ""Revenge of the Dead""  and was marketed to appear like a gut-munching zombie picture.  Many  viewers may have been disappointed when they found out there was no blood  or gore and instead they were watching a stylishly unique and intelligent  thriller that required them to pay attention.  At least this new DVD  retains the original ""Zeder"" title and markets it for what it is.
That said, the DVD is quite disappointing in this full-frame release  with no extras.  The film also looks very grainy (the old video release  looked better!) and, most startling, there are some slight horizontal  ""video stretch"" marks in some of the later scenes! (I have  checked 2 separate DVDs of this title and they are identical).  Could this  transfer have been taken from a video master?  It sure appears to have  been considering such video drop-out.  Still, I must say it's a required  purchase, flaws and all.  ""Zeder"" on DVD....this is truly an  amazing period for euro-horror fans.",961113600,6,1333,4.954545454545454
877527,5,630443507X,"The title of this review is for all you chumps who wrote a bad review for this great movie.  Revenge of the Dead is the movie Zeder under a different name.  Don't buy the ROTD version, but do buy the slightly superior version  called Zeder that is also offered on this sight on VHS or DVD.  With that  clarified, let me get on with my review:  This movie ROCKS!  I have never  seen anything like it!  It's part conspiracy movie and part zombie flick.  Oh, and despite popular belief, Zombies ARE in this flick.  They get about  two minutes of screen time at the end of the movie (before that, we only  heard them breath or see their shadow) and their make-up job consists  entirely of only pale gray skin, but they are still creepy and cool.  The  violence level is also minimum.  This has all of the ingrdients of a  borefest of an Italian zombie flick (the fact that it runs for over 100  minutes doesn't help either), but the director makes it work.  It is  suspenseful, entertaining, and overall well done.  The zombies (when  they're around anyway) are some of the best ever.  They are fairly  intelligent (by zombie standards anyway), elusive (we usually only hear  them or see a shadow, like I said before.  There are no brainless armies of  the living dead here.), and just plain SCARY!  If you are expecting a  Romero or Fulci style zombie flick, you will be disapointed.  This film  demands its viewers to THINK for once and NOT be mindlessly entertained by  gore and mayhem.  The plot is a bit hard to follow, so you will have to  concentrate hard while watching.  If you can do that, you will have a great  time.  If you can't, go watch some brainless crap like Zombie 3 or Doctor  Butcher(fun films but still garbage).  If you want to go somewhere in the  middle as far as intelligence goes, watch The Beyond or Phenomena.",959040000,9,1835,4.455927051671733

877529,5,630443507X,"A rare and mysterious gem, ZEDER is a wonderful find for discriminating horror fans. Subtle, serious, atmospheric, intelligent, and woefully underrated, the film is one of the best kept secrets of the horror genre, largely due to its having been deceptively marketed on home video. Hidden behind moronic gut-muncher zombie box art, it disappointed those in search of cheap, bloody thrills, and was passed over without a second glance by most who could have appreciated it.

  After one of the best prologues to be found anywhere in fantasy cinema, ZEDER never degenerates into genre cliche. Maintaining a palpable aura of mystery to the end, it owes more to Borges and the smart supernatural investigation stories of M.R. James than it does to Stephen King. King's 'Pet Sematary' inevitably comes up in discussions of ZEDER due to their suspiciously similar conclusions: I don't know who got there first, but ZEDER has a permanent place in my collection, and if I never see 'Pet Sematary' again it will be too soon.

  So can someone explain to me why this DVD release, that was so welcome and so unexpected, is not only full frame, but appears to have been mastered from the ugly videotape of the butchered American version, 'Revenge Of The Dead'?

  Glad as I am to be able to add this film to my DVD  collection, this edition is a real disappointment: honestly, if you're  going to release a film like this one, in this format, wouldn't it make  sense to keep in mind who its likely audience is, and what their expectations are likely to be? There really is no excuse for this kind of thing when Anchor Bay has been showing us how it should be done for a number of years now - though rarely with a film the calibre of this one. Making this even more disappointing is the fact that there has since been a European DVD release that reportedly contains a glorious widescreen print.

  Having said that, it would be a mistake to miss ZEDER.",943056000,24,1939,4.661764705882353

This is a very un-typical horror film which makes it quite refreshing and interesting. For most of the beginning I was quite enthralled by the pacing and the effort of the protagonist to reach some sort of conclusion. The start of the film shows us a house in Italy in the early 1920's and it is haunted by some horrendous and malicious ghost who has recently killed an old hag, next comes a clairvoyant and a scientist who walk into the basement where the girl clairvoyant assumes the identity of the dead man from a previous life. Once they find the bones of the man, they find a wallet and it reveals that the man was 'Edward Zeder', an albino, lunatic-philosopher who had believed in ""Kai-zons"", areas which were places where death had no value, this is an ancient idea which stems from the Persians and the Greeks.

Arrive in Italy in the 1970's where a struggling writer who smokes too much is using a typewriter and he finds that the ribbon has some used text upon it and he types up a few papers from what he finds and has a mystery upon his hands. He goes through the usual odds and ends in an attempt to crack the mystery of the ""Kai-zons"" and he visits a small village where there is a cemetery and all sorts of weird people. The end of the film, in which his girlfriend dies and he takes her to a ""Kai-zon"" to bring her back, is a result from the lack of his willingness to have loved a living creature while she was alive and it is quite expected when she eats his neck. This is a very good film and the director is quite capable of pushing a story of interest along. For those of you expecting a zombie film, this isn't it.",1390780800,,1661,4.303514376996805
7871353,4,630443507X,"Zeder (Pupi Avati, 1983)

Giuseppe ""Pupi"" Avati, with the exception of a bit of the mid-nineties, has been pumping out movies at an average of two a year since 1975. He achieved his greatest success with his third movie, The House with the Laughing Windows, a low-key giallo flick which is revered by giallo fans as much as early Argento. This is not to say that his post-1976 output has been bad, just that not all that many people are seeing it. This is a crime, because the more of Avati's work I get to know, the more I think he's one of the gems of the Italian film industry. He's been making low-key horror, fantasy, and giallo films that stand in stark contrast to the operatic cinematography of Argento or the over-the-top gore of Lenzi or Fulci for over a quarter-century. It's only a matter of time before he becomes just as famous. Or so I fervently hope. And Zeder does nothing to disabuse me of that notion.

Zeder, which was also released in a butchered American version as Revenge of the Dead in 1984, is not your typical zombie flick in any way. Especially not your typical Italian zombie flick. First and foremost, and let's get this out of the way right now to warn the hardcore horror kids, there are only two zombies in this movie, and they only pop up in the last act. Fulci this ain't. In fact, until that point, the movie has much more in common with the drama-heavy gialli Avati made earlier in his career; there's a mystery afoot, however vague it may be, and the hapless protagonists get caught up in trying to solve it. The hapless protagonist in this case is Stefano (Profondo Rosso's Gabriele Lavia), a writer whose wife Alessandra (Piret-a-Porter's Anne Canovas) buys him an electric typewriter for their anniversary. (Yes, it's dated. That's part of its charm.) While examining the ribbon, he discovers a fragment of a text written by a defrocked priest regarding the raising of the dead, which consumes him to the point where he tries to hunt down the priest. As is always the case with such things, he soon wishes he hadn't started out on this quest...

The movie reminds me in many ways of the American Satanic-Panic movies of the seventies (Satan's Cheerleaders, The Devil's Rain, The Dunwich Horror, that sort of thing). It's got all the ingredients you need for a good devil-worship movie; the unsuspecting protagonists, the laid-back-but-kind-of-ominous locals, the mystery that no one in their right mind would get involved with after the bad stuff started happening, you know the drill. The difference is that Avati is a much lower-key director than Clark, Corman, or that lot, and knows how to inject loads of atmosphere into a film to make it actually suspenseful, rather than just silly. Well worth seeing, especially for Italian horror fans; for those who aren't, Avati may be an excellent introduction. *** ",1291161600,2,2852,4.732394366197183
7871354,4,630443507X,"This is another pretty good Italian horror film, and a bit different from most of the other stuff I've seen.  Though this film involves the supernatural and the undead and whatnot, it is essentially a mystery, making it actually rather like a giallo in a lot of ways.  Suffice to say, this isn't a zombie film, so don't come in expecting that.

'Zeder' is the story of a young novelist, Stefano, who receives an old typewriter as a gift.  He starts fiddling with it a bit and looks at the ribbon.  He sees that there's some pretty spooky stuff written their, apparently involving burials and potential rebirths and things along those lines.  He is fairly intrigued and concerned about this discovery, and goes on to investigate this story throughout the rest of the film, and discovers that such experiments are still going on today etc.

Much like Avati's `House with Laughing Windows' this is an atmospheric piece with little on screen violence, and without much of the flash that typifies Italian horror.  This may be a cause for concern, as those things are typically what attract people to Italian horror, but, again like `House with Laughing Windows', `Zeder' has an atypically interesting plot, and manages to generate some genuine creepiness.  The plot doesn't necessarily add up to anything all that brilliant or revelatory, but it is more than sufficiently compelling while you're watching, which is good enough for at least a single viewing.  (I've only seen it once, so I don't know how it would hold up under repeated viewing)

The acting dubbing, and dialogue is about par the course for this sorta film, meaning it is acceptable if far from remarkable and certainly not up to modern day Hollywood standards.  Technically, the film is again competent if unremarkable, except with regards to the editing, which is really very jagged and rough at the beginning of the film.  The film moves about from place to place quite a bit early on with few real transitions, so it's pretty damn jumpy.  It seems to clear itself up a bit as the film goes on.

The score is a bit weird, the most prominent piece being a throbbing, Goblin-esque bassline overlaid with some piercing shrieking strings.  This piece is acceptable, if a bit overbearing.  It can be pretty unnerving at times, particularly a nice pulsing little 2 note thing that come up every now and then.

This film certainly isn't scary but it can be pretty creepy at times.  The climax is well done, and there's a particularly nice scene towards the middle of the film where Stefano confronts a rather hostile, creepy old woman who is shrouded completely in shadow, except for her feet.

The DVD of this sucks.  Not widescreen, looks like crap, sounds like crap etc.  But, what are you gonna do.

Yes, another worthwhile Italian horror film.  Certainly not the best of the lot, but worth a look for aficionados.",1114300800,,2875,4.796747967479675

There is little to no gore, bad bad BAD acting and the soundtrack.  That soundtrack, yikes!  I wasn't expecting a Fulci-ish bloodfest but I was at least expecting to be entertained.  Watch it only if you're having trouble sleeping.  It took me three days to watch the entire film from beginning to end because I kept falling asleep.  Ugh!",1112659200,,584,4.504761904761905

7871357,5,630443507X,"The five star rating is for the movie and not for the Creature Features release here. This movie is called 'Zeder' and is available in an out-of-print DVD and I do believe VHS under that title. There is a current release of 'Zeder' on a region 2 PAL DVD which does have good reviews for the print quality. Amazon.com does not carry the region 2 PAL DVD but you can find it with a Froogle search. If you do not have a DVD player that is region free and will handle PAL, you can find one on Amazon.com, including some cheap models. Philips models DVD726 and DVP642, among other Philips models, and AMW S-99 can play this DVD (these models only require a 4 or 5 digit code you can enter from your remote to make them region free; you can get the code from videohelp.com). With regards to the Creature Features VHS tape, it is missing 10 minutes of the film including 2 very important scenes. Look in the used section on this page and you can find copies of the Lightning Video release which is the complete theatrical release and pretty good quality to boot. If you see a listing in the used section that states that the box has different cover art than the one pictured on this page, that is the Lightning Video release. The cover art is the same subject (a zombie coming out of the street) but is quite different with a blue nighttime sky for the background. We can be thankful that the cover art is different so as to easily distinguish the bad from the good. With regards to the movie 'Revenge Of The Dead' A.K.A. 'Zeder', this is one of my favorite horror movies and one of the best. If you are looking for a gorey plotness romp, then avoid this movie (an intelligent well made movie could offend your sensitivities; as evidenced by most of the reviews on this page). This movie was released to the U.S. in 1984 under the title 'Revenge Of The Dead' to play on the zombie movie popularity of the time. This was the distributors decision and had nothing to do with the film-maker. 'Zeder'/'Revenge Of The Dead' is an unsettling tale of a quest for immortality in contrast, that of the spirit and that of the flesh. In this story we have two men essentially in a search for something different; not so much a new beginning but a different direction. However, will one man's search interfere with the others; and those who seek what they would consider the ultimate prize, would they sacrifice it for themselves and others to protect it. This is a mix of giallo, gothic, and yes zombie movies which is frought with conspiracy. I have been intentionally vague to keep from spoiling anything for the would be viewer. This is not a movie for the gorehound or for someone who prefers movies that require no thought process. Enjoy-Bob",1086652800,2,2728,4.468937875751503
7871358,4,630443507X,"Italian director Pupi Avati's ""Zeder"" has received significant criticism from many horror film aficionados who thought that a picture about reanimated corpses should resemble Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" or the George Romero undead trilogy. A more attentive viewer adequately schooled in the subtleties of Italian horror films should quickly recognize that ""Zeder"" is a cerebral look at the living dead, a movie that moves beyond splatter effects and shambling creatures in an attempt to scare the socks off its viewers. Steeped in oppressive atmosphere and weird science, Avati's film achieves a measure of uniqueness even as it uses plot elements found in such diverse movies as ""Pet Semetary"" and ""The Exorcist."" Personally, I think Avati's ""The House with the Laughing Windows"" is light years ahead of ""Zeder,"" but that doesn't mean this film lacks interesting ideas and, even if they do not always work, a few attempts to craft very scary scenes. In short, you should probably look elsewhere if your interest lies in exploding heads or crude tracheotomies performed by lumbering, undead brutes. If you want to think a little bit, check out ""Zeder.""
The film opens in 1950s France, where a grim discovery made in the basement of a ostensibly haunted mansion turns out to be the body of the long missing Paolo Zeder. Although we don't learn much about this man's work until later in the film, the discovery of this scientist's corpse is of great interest to many people. How Zeder got here and why a young girl encountered a supernatural emanation over the exact spot where the police discovered the corpse initially begs explanation. Avati uses the opening sequences of the film to set the tone for the film, and what a tone it is! The house rumbles and bangs ominously as though haunted by a thousand ghosts. The basement where Zeder and the young girl turn up is a ghastly place heavy with menace. You know after just a few minutes that this film has the potential to be a very fearsome adventure.
Flash forward into early 1980s Italy where Stefano, an aspiring writer, and his sexy girlfriend Alessandra live. In order to celebrate an anniversary, Alessandra gives Stefano a nifty electric typewriter. Her boyfriend is quite happy with the gift and sets out to start writing when he discovers an anomaly on the ribbon cartridge that came with the gift. A quick investigation of this ribbon reveals that someone, probably the last person who owned the typewriter, wrote a most unusual report about some weird thing called K-zones and how the barriers of death will be broken down forever. Intrigued, Stefano quickly launches a wider inquiry into the origins of the strange message. His sleuthing takes him and his girlfriend into a world few could imagine. It turns out that Paolo Zeder discovered specific places on the planet where the dead can rise from their graves. Elated, Stefano further learns that the typewriter belonged to a priest who once lived in Italy. Dragging along the increasingly reluctant Alessandra, Stefano digs into this man's background and soon learns that a group of researchers from France are working in the same region where this priest lived. Stefano witnesses first hand how the K-zones work, and when an act of treachery takes the life of his beloved Alessandra, our hero resorts to the sort of behavior exhibited in a Stephen King novel with the same horrific results.
""Zeder"" is definitely a cut above your typical Italian horror film. The soundtrack, done by none other than ""Cannibal Holocaust"" composer Riz Ortolani, throbs and bangs away with a sense of desperate abandon. The acting, mainly from Gabriele Lavia as Stefano and Anne Canovas as the beautiful Alessandra, works about as well as you could expect from an Italian film. I probably wouldn't have cast Lavia in the lead role, as he is a rather bland figure for such a big part. The biggest drawback with ""Zeder"" is the lousy DVD transfer, which often obscures scenes in a slight haze of grain and gives the movie a cheap look. Moreover, I thought the pacing lagged in a few places, especially during Stefano's lengthy investigations into the priest who owned the typewriter. Overall, however, I liked ""Zeder"" and thought the idea of K-zones an intriguing one. I even laughed in a few places, like the scene where Stefano watches the laughing corpse on the monitor. A slap in the face to Fulci and Lenzi fans, perhaps, but Pupi Avati's film should find a few stalwart souls who will see something in it despite its absence of over the top gore.",1070668800,4,4541,4.906371911573472
