1255947,3,B00002RASV,"DJANGO has a wonderfully gritty feel to it. It and other Italian westerns of it's time (e.g., ""The Dollars Trilogy"") had an enormous effect on American cinema -- first in the Western genre (even the later John Wayne  films drew from the Italian West) and then branching into mainstream  affairs. Though the character of the antihero, so popular in the spaghetti  westerns, had long existed in American film, he lived (and usually died) in  the crime noir genre almost exclusively. Until Italy made its mark,  westerns were inhabited by absolutes: good guys wore white and bad guys  wore black. But if something as pure as the good old fashioned western  could be polluted by the noirish antihero elements, so could (and would)  all other genres. And so it went.
Franco Nero, as the title character,  Django, fulfills perfectly the classic spaghetti western role (as did  Eastwood in his own projects). He is the unstoppable, immoral, gunfighter  whose only weakness is his conscience. Seemingly indefatigable, he falters  only slightly when his heart is touched, and is undone -- only to return to  conquer all his opposition. Eastwood follows the identical path in FISTFULL  OF DOLLARS.
All told, DJANGO is a fun and entertaining, though not light  and inconsequential, glance back to the beginnings of the modern western.  My only real complaint with the DVD release is the lack of option  concerning subtitles and the original-language track. Especially after the  packaging material laments the poor English-language dubbing, I would've  been excited to hear the original track (with English subs, of course!).",961027200,2,1614,5.162162162162162
1255948,4,B00002RASV,"What a great find for those interested in the spaghetti Western!  _Django_ is one of the great films from this tradition, a true classic.
Set in an other-worldly town, where the streets are always muddy, the film creates  an unusual, haunting atmosphere.  Into this forgotten town trudges the man  in black, Django (played by Franco Nero), dragging a coffin behind him.  In  the coffin is his trusty Gatling gun, which he proceeds to whip out and mow  down scores of bad guys.
Director Sergio Corbucci created a truly  memorable experience with this film, one of the most violent of all  spaghetti Westerns.  It is truly on a par with the Sergio Leone/Clint  Eastwood collaborations that most people associate with the  genre.
Unfortunately, _Django Strikes Again_ isn't quite in the same  league.  It is certainly an entertaining film, with Django (again played by  Nero) now a monk, perhaps to make up for his former ways, called back into  action against a band of slavers who patrol the Amazon River in an armored  steamship!  You can't get much further from the typical landscape of the  Western than the Amazon jungle, which is only one area where the sequel is  a bit of a misfire.  It's nice to see Franco Nero back in action, but the  film doesn't compare well to the original.
Still, Anchor Bay, the company  which released this double bill, must be congratulated for taking a chance  with this material.  Hopefully, sales of this title will warrant the  release of more spaghetti Western classics (such as _The Big Gundown_ and  _The Great Silence_).",948326400,5,1561,4.836501901140684
1255949,4,B00002RASV,"Django and its sequel are well known to fans of the Spaghetti Western, legendary for their action, nerve, and impact on the genre.  The original is very similar to A Fistful of Dollars (lone gunman comes to a wretched  town with two gangs ruling it) but the film appears even more low-budget  and nasty than the Leone film.  For SW fans, the dvd release is a dream  come true.  Django Strikes Again is an excellent action film made long  after the SW fad had run its course.  It manages to be true to the  conventions of the genre while still being palatable to a wide modern  audience.  It has many amazing action scenes, and definitely was worthy of  a USA release...but none of the Django films ever appeared here  theatrically (and there were over 50 sequels to the original!).  Nero is  good as the mysterious gunfighter and has matured into a solid presence  onscreen.  Filmed in Colombia, Django Strikes Back is recommended to any  fan of the action genre.",946080000,3,963,4.597633136094674
1255950,3,B00002RASV,"Django was director's Sergio Corbucci pet project for a couple of years (he hardly finished the film, as half way through he ran out of money). It features italian actor Franco Nero in one of his first roles ever (he had  been working as a fireman prior to making this film), and the film would  spawn many other rip off's in name only. It remained so popular, that in  Germany whenever there is a film with Franco Nero in it, they use the  Django name (even if the film takes place nowadays). As far as the story  goes, it features a black-clad gunslinger dragging a coffin through the  mud, he arrives in a border town and pulls out a machine-gun from his  coffin, killing about everyone in sight. The bad guys, of course don't  appreciate this, and start torturing the locals. Among the tortures, there  is the infamous ear-slicing scene that probably inspired Tarantino's in  Reservoir Dogs, only that here it goes beyond anything you could have  imagined (I'm referring to the uncut and uncensored version of this film,  which I hope is the same as this DVD). Afterwards, a series of further  tortures and sadism ensues, until our hero, against all odds, must beat the  bad fuys in a cemetary. An incredible film, not for the faint-hearted, that  included among it's crew members, director of photography Enzo Barboni, who  would later on make the Trinity films (featuring a Franco Nero look-alike  in Terence Hill) and Ruggero Deodato, who would make the infamous Cannibal  Holocaust (when will this gorefest be released in DVD?). Django would also  influence the Jimmy Cliff reggae gangster film The Harder They Come, which  covers pretty much the same story. Django Strikes Again, on the other hand,  is among the worst sequels ever made (hence, the overall 3 stars, 5 for  Django and 1 for the sequel). Almost entirely shot in Colombia, South  America (? ), featuring some of the country's worst local actors along the  way. The least said about this inept sequel the better (when will Giulio  Questi's Django Kill... If You Live Shoot! starring Tomas Milian be  released?).",942537600,14,2083,4.79718309859155

7916162,3,B00002RASV,"Other then the excelent ""The Great Silence"" - Most Corbucci films are inept, sloppy, and cartoonish. Speed Racer can be less cartoonsish. (just check out Navajo Joe or Campaneros).

In Django a laconic, x-yankee officer, anti-hero drags around a crucifix incrusted coffin with a little surprise inside.  I assume Django must represent the vengeful Christ of Revelations. This is because as Christ figure Django certainly is not of the ""turn the other cheek"" variety. Django seems to be surrounded by more Christ symbolism then I can count including a death wielding crucifix in a grave yard showdown(with symbolic red rose bush and Catholic prayer).

I found that much of the music in the film is quite good for a non-Morricone soundtrack but the opening corny Django song seems way over the top to say the least.

Very unfortunately Franco Nero's understated anti-hero style acting is completely ruined be thin Casper Milquetoast voice, hokey dialogue and thin flat sound in the English dubbed version.

I would only recommend wathing Django in the Blue Underground Italian language version.  In the Italian version, Django's voice, other voices and music sound rich and full. The dialogue is vastly improved and much more interesting as well. That said - the dubbed italian voices do not match the mouths very well and it is a bit odd watching the these American western characters speaking in Italian.

i would not recommend Anchor Bay's version of Django becaue it looks and sounds only OK but Blue Underground's version looks and sounds great.  Blue Underground's beautiful Italian dubbed version rates 4 stars.

The other DVD in the two DVD package is ""Django Strikes Again"" and it's worse on every level, although it does make a cliched attempt to be stylish. The plot and acting are inane, and the action scenes are preposterous. - (Django escapes by rolling down a hill in a barrel). The people and locations give no feeling for the American West, or Mexico. The film would be insulting if it were not so unimportant and forgettable. For example an evil but hot looking black babe in a retro-chain-outfit pours water over herself as a means to torture enslaved Mexicans on a jet-black river boat that apears to be cruising the Amazon  - Where the hell is this supposed to take place?! Simply laughable.

Poor Donald Pleasance cannot help this atrocity. Instead seeing him in the film is merely sad. Its tough to rate this DVD combo with such a bad movie included in it. I would have given ""Django"" more stars if ""Strikes Again"" were not attached to this package. Expect ""Strikes Again"" to be on Mystery Science theater 3000 someday.

Fortunatly the original ""Django"" is a good film in its Italian language by Blue Underground. Django along with A Fistful Of Dollars were the the proto-types for the Spaghetti Western anti-hero and the many dark, violent stylish spaghetti westerns that were to follow. In that regard maybe Django deserves recognition and a place in history. That said I can't say the same for Django Strikes Again which degrades the two DVD package.",1133136000,2,3075,4.9264990328820115
7916163,5,B00002RASV,This is a fantastic DVD set with two very entertaining Django movies starring Franco Nero. Both flicks are fun stuff and this is a terrific DVD package with some cool extra features. IT'S GREAT! THANKS ANCHOR BAY!,1132704000,2,213,4.783783783783784
7916164,4,B00002RASV,"Not sure about director 'Ted Archer' but one thing is certain: 'Ted Archer' is not Guiseppe Colizzi or Sergio Carbucci! -- however 'Ted' is still a gifted director all the same.  Likewise not sure if 'Django Strikes Again' truly qualifies as a spaghetti western or just as an offbeat Italian film?  Whatever the case diehard Italian film/spaghetti western lovers will love this movie but everyone else will probably loathe it as we can see from the one-star reviews already submitted. For those of us who love the imagination and intention of these Italian films the movie does not disappoint, especially with the characteristically eccentric performance of Donald Pleasance, as well as a very mature and thoughtful rendition from Franco Nero.  The transfer to DVD is excellent in region zero - a nice surprise as well!  Italian film/spaghetti western movie lovers will rate this film as four stars, while all others will probably give only one star.  In the end though as a creative work it is a great effort based upon a lofty ideal which the film does not quite reach however four out of five stars for trying!",1059264000,2,1113,4.867724867724868
7916165,3,B00002RASV,"This film is the perfect counterpoint to Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" which rewards the patient viewer with a slowly unfolding mythic tale that ends up transcending both the American and Spaghetti western genres.  Corbucci, as always, is an impatient director, beginning his film not with an interminable wait for a train, but with a simple image of a gunfighter hauling a coffin and saddle (most people forget that little detail) behind him through a muddy wasteland.  Enzo Barboni's exquisite camerawork and Luis Bacalov's witty score punctuates this frenetic, modest film.  If it weren't for the literally dozens of interchangeable villains (Corbucci has Major Jackson's cretins wear red scarves seemingly so Django and the audience can tell bystanders from bad guys), this probably wouldn't have been such an influential film in Europe.  But the extremity of the violence, combined with the comic-book style stunt-work and photography (John Woo points to Peckinpah as a major influence, but one has to wonder how many times he watched Corbucci, too!), is probably what made it such a phenomenon.  There's art to this movie--but an art diametrically opposed to Leone's works.  For whereas Leone is all suspense--a series of build-ups and crescendi, almost classical in their orientation, concluding with a final, overwhelmingly tense battle--Corbucci seems always in a hurry to get on to the *next* battle.  Men fall like ten-pins; bullets fly thick as a swarm of bees; and it's all over usually before any level of suspense ever begins to build.  Only the concluding scene, with the mysterious Django struggling to use his beloved's (?) cemetery cross as a desperate replacement for his mangled hands, gestures to anything more than the sum of the film's parts.  Great fun for those who don't mind a ""Wild Bunch""-like bodycount to go with a whole lot of style but not a whole lot of substance.",1032652800,3,1908,5.089743589743589
7916166,4,B00002RASV,"I won't argue here, the four westerns directed by Sergio Leone in the sixties fly high above the hundreds of spaghetti westerns shot in Spain, Greece, Portugal, Italy or Iceland during the same blessed period. However, this not a reason to overlook the cinematographic works of the outsiders of the italian master. Take Sergio Corbucci's DJANGO for instance. True that Franco Nero doesn't have Clint Eastwood's presence, true that DJANGO's supporting characters can't be compared with Gian-Maria Volont or Klaus Kinski's hysterical apparitions.
So what, why leave this movie in the overpopulated Purgatory of forgotten movies. I was excited by the duels presented in Django, not by the machine-gun duels too predictible, but rather by the duel in Nathaniel's saloon or the final duel in a cemetery between a Franco Nero dealing with a crushed hand and the bad guys wearing red clothes so that you (and Django) can't miss them when the gunfight starts.
DJANGO STRIKES BACK, set in Mexico but shot in beautiful Colombia 20 years later, is not so exciting but you absolutely have to watch once the prologue of the movie, presented in italian with subtitles. Two pistoleros, well over the 60 years old mark, desperately try, after an hilarious gunfight, to remember the name of this legend of the West, the Man with the machine-gun. The irony of this scene is an excellent homage to Sergio Leone.
Two mini-interviews with Franco Nero, an interactive game for your kids, production notes and trailers complete this limited Anchor Bay edition.
