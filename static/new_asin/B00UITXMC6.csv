8707028,4,B00UITXMC6,"My 6 year old daughter loves Max & Ruby. I bought this video for her to watch with our friendship and sharing unit study. Max & Ruby is fun, I often wonder why the mom and dad are not present in the show. I love how Max always seems to help in the end even though he has been getting into trouble the entire time. Ruby is patient  with him and so kind. I believe this series teaches kids to be kind to one another! Great show and the price was awesome as well.",1458691200,2,460,3.893617021276596
