8105526,2,B000E3LGS8,"even awful.

Is there anything worse than a gathering of unknown actors playing the roles of bad, and badly self-conscious (even Molly Parker), actors who are convincingly ""acting"" like amatuers -- including those who are ostensibly successful?

And then the best parts are played by Sandra Oh, who has less than fifteen seconds of screen time, and a guy who is instead a cop pretending to be an actor: better at it than all the other actors who, according to the script, had and or were training in acting.

And I must have missed the widescreen.",1338508800,,547,4.677083333333333

8105529,5,B000E3LGS8,"I saw BREAK A LEG at a film festival a couple years ago and was pleasantly surprised.  First off, John Cassini is one of those actor's actors who has been in everything but you probably wouldn't recognize him if he were to punch you in the nose.  At any rate, he does an excellent job at keeping the reins in on his character, where I think a lot of other actors would start chewing up the scenery and blow it.  Cassini does anything but that and provides a very compelling and beguiling anti-hero.  The dialogue is crisp, the story tight and director Monika Mitchell maintains that delicate balance between the sardonic and the satirical that is so hard to do to pay off a black comedy like this one.  A real indie gem and a must-see for actors.  I wish there were more like it out there.",1185580800,5,789,4.333333333333333
8105530,5,B000E3LGS8,"I saw this movie in the theatre at a film festival a year or so ago.  It was a surprisingly good drama/comedy/thriller with surprises the whole way through that really keep you on the edge of your seat.  I don't always expect too much from indie films, but this one was really very good.  This movie gives you a look at what people go through in Hollywood and New York to pursue the acting dream.  The main character goes through many changes and makes some life-altering choices in his pursuit of a starring role.  Jennifer Beals co-stars and gives a funny and charming performance as the lead characters' actress friend.  While I enjoyed this movie, I probably wouldn't pay over $20 to own it, but it is definately worth $15-$20, in my opinion.",1140393600,12,746,4.571428571428571
8105531,5,B000E3LGS8,"I saw this about two years ago on cable and I was very pleased about it. I really enjoyed it, despite missing the first 20 Minutes. I was waiting for a DVD Release for a while and it's coming.

Break a Leg is a good film about a good actor who can't get a break. So he literly breaks a leg. No, not his. Other actors, filmmakers, etc. who will stop him from acting. It's a Thriller/Comedy/Drama and is very well made.

Rated R - For Violence, Language and Themes.",1140134400,8,463,4.133333333333334
