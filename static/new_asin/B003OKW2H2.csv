8547916,5,B003OKW2H2,"Got this to see what we might expect from a Caribbean cruise. We didn't do this exact itnerary, but it was a good look at the general sights and things to do for the kids. Our family loved watching it to get excited about our upcoming trip. Great looks into each island stop (It has Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Cozumel and Labadee)It shows the area in Haiti before the earthquake in Haiti, but I don't think that port was damaged and the boats still go there. Very beautiful scenery and nice video of Haiti and all the islands. Very nice scenics, music, information and funny segments for the kids. Very well produced travel guide.
The DVD also comes with full video segments of other trips the traveling family has done in the past. I think these are from other DVDs so it was great to be included on this one. It shows things to do in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and the Bahamas. It also has an episode on the Miami area for kids which is very well done and we enjoyed watching it, even though we won't have enough time in Miami, but if you have a few days, the video is great. Lots of fun segments on the ship, which is good to see, even if you're not on this exact ship. Showed how the boats steers and had an interview with the captain. Great value for the money, lots of bonus features and a great trip planner for any of the included islands. Have fun!!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cruising-With-Kids-Travel-With-Kids-Caribbean-Cruise/dp/B003OKW2H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cruising With Kids: Travel With Kids Caribbean Cruise</a>",1281916800,,1584,4.892193308550186
