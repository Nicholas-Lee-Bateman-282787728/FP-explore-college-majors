8274149,4,B0019K4YQQ,"I liked this documentary.  I was expecting it to be more about the Ferus Gallery (since that is the subtitle) and it was spot on.  I think they did a great job with the probably limited amount of footage about the subjects from that time.  I am glad I could get this film on DVD.  I had little idea about American art at this time, especially on the west coast. It will be worth watching a few times over the years as I see more exhibits.",1444608000,,438,4.058139534883721
8274150,3,B0019K4YQQ,"This is a cut-and-paste documentary that rambles and flip-flops its way to the end. The filmmaker offers appetizers, but manages to keep his intended audience away from the main subjects. A forced reunion of artists in their old age intermingled with periodic comments by a self-important Dennis Hopper doesn't exactly make for a good show. Initially, what drew me to ""The Cool School"" was the fact that it was bringing attention to an art scene which has long deserved to be showcased on film. I was excited to learn more about Ed Kienholz, but before any substantial information builds up about any of the artists, the film switches gear to focus on Walter Hopps. Walter Hopps corralled these artists with his Ferus Gallery and helped to bring them nationwide recognition, but the heart of the documentary should center on the artists and their works, rather than the man/men who acted as their keepers. The crowning achievement on this disc is the bonus feature on Ed Kienholz where he's explaining his artistic processes while casting a naked, clueless interviewer from the waist down, and later, from the waist up with wet plaster.",1430697600,4,1136,4.952879581151833
8274151,2,B0019K4YQQ,"Kristine McKenna and Morgan Neville's film aims to show us how ""LA learned to Love Modern Art."" They make their case via a singular focus on the troubled, erratic curator (the late) Walter Hopps and suave opportunistic gallerist Irving Blum and their joint venture, Ferus Gallery, in the early 1960s. The modern artists that LA learned to love include Edward Kienholz, Ken Price, Ed Ruscha, Billy Al Bengston, Craig Kauffman, Ed Moses, John Altoon, Larry Bell and Robert Irwin. The strength of this documentary is the gathering of vintage photography and film from the Ferus ""group.""

""The Cool School,"" however, is premised on a false conceit, and merely repeats the 30 year old publicity-tinged received wisdom that LA crossed the threshold into embracing modern art with Hopps, Ferus and their stable only in the early 1960s. This anti-historical claim is easily overturned by consulting the real modernist art history of Southern California.

A-list Modernist art was being done in Southern California since the 1920s by such pioneering modernists as Stanton McDonald Wright; and during the 1940s by abstractionist Lorser Feitelson and his wife, the surrealist/abstractionist Helen Lundeberg. All three were active into the 1970s. Serious modern-friendly galleries included the Stanley Rose Bookshop and Zeitlin & VerBrugge on La Cienega Blvd. (later, LA's gallery row); other modernist galleries included Earl Stendahl, Frank Perls and the very notable Jacob Landau.

The post-war period saw the rise of artists like Rico LeBrun (arrived in LA, 1938 - and in 2012, still no retrospective exhibition!), his pupil Howard Warshaw, and the anti-fascist Hungarian &eacute;migr&eacute; social surrealist, Francis DeErdely, who taught at USC. UCLA's Bill Brice went from representation to abstraction in the 1950s; and his colleague Jan Stussy worked in an expressionist figurative mode throughout his career. Sculptor Jack Zajac produced powerful, tortured bronzes. In my own career as a curator in LA, 1981 - 2008, I often encountered these works in the homes of Hollywood art collectors and on the Westside. Clearly these were people of LA who ""learned to love Modern Art"" ----  without Ferus. I could go on and on with pre-Ferus examples, but I trust I've made my point.

What separates the earlier Southern California artists from ""The Cool School"" is their choice to be in historical lineage with European modernist tendencies, adapting these styles to the LA and California milieu. They were painters, sculptors and printmakers who grounded their modernism in art history and traditional foundational preparation. By contrast, ""The Cool School"" scorned precedent, and embraced novelty and new materials like fiberglass, optical effects, or the detritus of junk shops. In my view, theirs is a mixed legacy, with Irwin having the most credible output and depth over a long career. Kienholz lost his way in the 1980s, devolving into embarrassing cliches; the word paintings and prints of Ruscha are in the end little more than clever games. And the novelty-driven bad-boy ""Cool School"" proved oblivious to genius: they voted NOT to include Richard Diebenkorn in the Ferus stable. Diebenkorn is now considered one of the most important American artists of the later 20th century.

McKenna and Neville's film, in addition to failing art history, is barely coherent. The narrative thread is frequently lost to excurses of anecdotal interviews with surviving artists, ex-wives, collectors, and Hopps and Blum; some of their remarks are banal. The interviews are shot at odd angles, jumpy, and occasionally the black and white stock is ""accented"" by digitally coloring an artist's shoes or the paint in his bucket. Gee whiz!

The biggest failing of ""The Cool School"" is its lack of serious analysis of the art and what it means in the 21st century and LA's modernist legacy. As noted in other reviews, this tends to cast negative suspicions on the art itself, in addition to this mis-direction of the documentary.

As time passes, art history reserves the best analysis. In 2012, the Pasadena Museum of California Art presented ""LA Raw: Abject Expressionism in Los Angeles, 1945 -80,"" curated by Michael Duncan, and with a catalog that offered a wider and deeper context for Southern California modernism than trivially served up by ""The Cool School.""",1341446400,9,4348,5.2821997105644
8274152,3,B0019K4YQQ,"I found this documentary by chance. I'm thrilled that it exists. But it is kind of a disappointment. For a documentary about visual art, it's not particularly easy on the eye. And for a documentary about visual art, it doesn't include much discussion of art or even much art. The cover seems to promise an affectionate look at a handful of ""cool"" California artists (John Altoon, Craig Kauffman, Allen Lynch, Ed Kienholz, Ed Moses, Robert Irwin & Billy Al Bengston are the ones that appear on the cover photo, but the group also included Larry Bell & Ed Ruscha) that gathered together in the late fifties in Southern California and began creating art before Southern California had an art scene. But instead of foregrounding the half dozen or so ""cool"" California artists living in a boheme paradise & creating a new kind of art (which explored/incorporated/appropriated car culture & other industrial/commercial forms & contents, exhibited a frank anti-romantic attitude toward sexuality, and displayed an irreverence toward previous art history and toward NY art scene seriousness) the filmmakers foreground Ferus Gallery co-founders Walter Hopps & Irving Blum. These two may have provided the gallery space, but poverty and lack of attention from the outside world is what kept the group together; and the lure of fame & fortune is what tore it apart. That's the real story here, and the essence of their brand of California cool & detachment. If only the documentary had focused less on Hopps & Blum & the Ferus Gallery & more on the actual artists & art work & what relation the work had to Southern California culture/independence/attitude/cool this could have been a real masterpiece.  There's a little of that, but not nearly enough.

The doc will be most interesting to those with an interest in the sociology of artistic collectives/movements.",1294876800,16,1853,5.072131147540984
8274153,3,B0019K4YQQ,"I love art, I love jazz, I love LA -- but I only managed to make it half way through The Cool School before I gave up and hit eject. The art looked abysmal... completely unappealing--actually not that much was shown, and maybe that was a blessing--and most of the artists came across in their interviews as a bunch of self-inflated egos -- so full of themselves that it became insufferable. Nevertheless, that is no fault of the documentary maker, and the film itself is well done. Marcel Duchamp was shown a little, but did the film makers mention Man Ray's presence in LA for a numbers of years before the LA art scene got rolling and that got Duchamp to LA to begin with? No; and Man Ray and was probably the best artist in LA before going back to Paris. If I'd like the art better or could get past the artists who were trying so hard to be somebody, maybe I would have gotten through the entire film. But I simply got fed up watching interviews with people who struck me as inferior talents with an exaggerated sense of self-importance.",1287619200,6,1041,4.398963730569948
