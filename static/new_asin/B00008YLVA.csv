1867459,5,B00008YLVA,Seeing all of the fascinating animals of North America (Extinct and Extant) is always a vision akin to a view of a beautiful landscape.,1390176000,,135,4.666666666666667
1867460,3,B00008YLVA,"I bought this for my grandson, but he was disappointed that it did not have more information.  It has good illustrations.",1373068800,,121,4.761904761904762
1867461,4,B00008YLVA,"In comparison with the epochal, revolutionary BBC pseudo-documentaries ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" and ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"", their ""Prehistoric America"" (hereafter PA) series is a bit pedestrian and muted.  Make no mistake, PA bestows a fascinating treasure trove of data, speculation, and analysis of several American megafauna mammals such as the American mastodon (Mammut), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), the short-faced bear (Arctodus), the saber-toothed cat Smilodon, the armadillo-like Glyphtodon, and the giant ground sloth.  However, I don't think you feel the same stirrings of wonder and stupefaction you do with the ""Walking..."" series.  Perhaps, that's because the CGI renderings of these now-extinct beasts comprise a relatively measly percentage of PA's running time.  Also, admittedly, the CGI is markedly inferior to that of the ""Walking..."" series, although PA does show CGI extinct mammals plausibly interacting with living modern mammals (Two examples: a Smilodon stalks and slays a camel and a jaguar - amazingly - throttles an armored glyphtodont).  Nevertheless, I do appreciate the BBC's producers strenuous efforts to recreate America's environment and climate in the Ice Age and the mammals - including Cro Magnon, our direct human ancestors - that populated it.

As another reviewer here outlined, PA is composed of six (6) main episodes (each narrated by the stately British tones of Jack Fortune) exploring various Ice Age American regions, from the Pacific Northwest, through the Arizona canyonlands, through the Midwest, to the tropical Florida oases.  Each episode begins by exploring fossils and other remains and speculating not only what the original animal may have looked like, but also what its environment looked like, and how it survived and eventually died there.  The extinct animals and environments are compared to modern ones.  Each episode concludes with a CGI rendition of how the flora and fauna might have appeared in 15,000 B.C. and forward.

Paleontology aficionados, more than the casual prehistoric animal buff, may appreciate PA and the ample, careful analysis of fossilized bones, tusks, teeth, and armor scutes it employs to reach its hypothetical conclusions about the prehistoric megafauna.  Others may find it a bit low-key, repetitious, and yawn-inducing.  I can understand the detractors' point of view, but I rather enjoyed PA anyway because of its insights into not only about how modern American fauna came about, but also how we humans entered and conquered (if that's the word) much of the continent.  PA also speculates on why most of the American megafauna died out, and why others (like musk oxen, bison, and grizzly bears) managed to carry on.  PA provides valuable lessons about the North American continent's constantly morphing environment, geography, and life and its implications for its future, including man's encroachment into more and more hitherto unspoiled habitats.

P.S.:  Although PA's CGI and animatronic illustrations are somewhat variable, they certainly have animation of proboscideans (you know, Columbian mammoths, woolly mammoths, and mastodons) down pat.  The series also has two bonus features (narrated by British actor Christopher Plummer) about the Grand Canyon's and the Everglades's modern creatures, reptiles, mammals, birds, and all.",1334016000,,3351,5.643426294820717
1867462,5,B00008YLVA,"A lot of bang for the buck.  True to form, the BBC once again delivers loads of interesting facts in an entertaining story-telling format. We get to see the fossils, then the modern landscape melts away to reveal a day in the life of the Great Plains at the end of the ice age 14,000 years ago. Just when you think it's over, there's 2 bonus chapters exploring the Everglades and the Grand Canyon.  Suitable for a wide audience. Walking With Dinosaure fans will not be disappointed.  Beautifully filmed, pleasing soundtrack and narration by Jack Fortune all suck you in for a long ride.",1197936000,3,586,4.615384615384615
1867463,4,B00008YLVA,"I have to be honest, the 1st time I watched this, I was a bit disappointed. I felt there was a bit too much focus on current species. However, upon reading more about this era, I realized that animals that are still there today do in fact play a big part of the fauna of this era as well, as do the extinct mega-fauna that are no longer with us. The program is very informative, and while some of the CG shots do tend to re-occur, I found the overall presentation of the product to be excellent. If you go into it knowing that you'll see a lot of information on current animals as well as those no longer with us, you should be very satisfied with this DVD. The only real lingering drawback for me is that no mention whatsoever is made of the Dire Wolf, and given that the same La Brea tar pits that yielded so many Smilodon skeletons also had even greater deposits of Dire Wolf remains, it does strike me as a glaring omission. Still, I'd have no problem recommending this program.",1188086400,,982,4.25668449197861
1867464,3,B00008YLVA,"There is an undisguised environmentalist streak running through this series but it is still quite good. The major focus, except for the last episode, is the fauna of North America during the last ice age.

The general pattern is as follows: an area is chosen and its climate is explained. Fossil evidence is examined as are the analogs provided by species which are still alive. From that, ""a typical day"" is constructed from the evidence.

Episode Synopses follow:

Land of the Mammoth - This episode concentrates on the animals of Beringia, the land mass exposed between Alaska and Siberia about 14,000 years ago. It is a harsh, northern climate, cold and dry. The star of the show is the wooly mammoth but there are other beasts examined as well. Some are still alive today and some are extinct. All are part of the eat or be eaten web of life. Only the very briefest mention is made of the top predator, man.

Canyonlands - This episode still takes place during the Pleistocene ice age but the environment is much different. It focuses on the region around the Grand Canyon. It was still magnificent back then and a harsh environment but it was moister too. Many of the animals in this one are familiar but there is a survey of extinct varieties as well. These include saber toothed cats, giant sloths and another variety of mammoth. The predation of man plays a bigger role in this episode.

Ice Age Oasis - This episode looks at the area of Florida which had quite a different climate at the time of the ice age. Mastodon, a relative of the mammoth, roamed the land as did giant armadillos and saber tooth cats. A sloth the height of a giraffe is another spectacular example. Along with these now extinct species were some that are still extant. The most dangerous of these was man.

Edge of the Ice - I think this is probably the best episode on the first disk. It does not spend as much time dealing with novel animals but the ones it does examine are covered in a bit more depth. It takes place in the Pacific Northwest. Instead of being covered by glaciers, it is depicted here as being on the edge of the ice and having grasslands and forests. The fauna, primarily mammoths, mastodons and scimitar toothed cats have been encountered in previous episodes but more time is devoted to their natural history. More time is spent with man as well. Instead of positing the first people arriving by the Beringia land bridge, it posits island hoping nomads in boats. It is well done.

American Serengeti - In this look at the Great Plains during the ice age, we are introduced to more mastodons, the short faced bear and a variety of animals that have close relatives in Africa. These include lions, cheetahs, camels, zebras a few who are still around in America like prairie dogs and bison.

Mammoths to Manhattan - The title of this episode is misleading. While it does, indeed, deal a bit with ""Manhattan"", the main subject is the extinction of the Ice Age creatures, the adaptation of others and the introduction from Europe of still more. The general thrust is that no species has survived the introduction of man to the environment without some changes. This is most true with Europeans.",1143676800,12,3195,4.6325088339222615
1867465,4,B00008YLVA,"Go in knowing what to expect and this DVD is a rewarding experience.  If (like the cover art would make you believe) you approach this DVD thinking that it will be a ""CG-documentary"" that imagines it is taking place in the Ice Age, replete with 100% CG and animatronics, then you will be sorely disappointed.  About 10% of the footage is of CG creatures (Mastodons, Mammoths, Sabre-Tooth Lions, etc.).  Most of this documentary concentrates on the living Ice Age relic species (Musk Ox, Arctic Ground Squirrel) or the living relatives of extinct species (African elephant substitutes for Mammoth; Prewalski's horse substitutes for ancient horse; modern bison substitute for Long-horned Bison, etc.)
The three documentaries on this DVD are intended to depict what this continent's flora & fauna were like prior to the widespread changes brought about by the Homo-Sapien arrival.  In this respect, it is interesting and fairly well-done.  Since the CG is not very good (on par with ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" but nowhere near as realistic as feature films such as ""Jurassic Park"") I was pleased that the vast majority of footage was of living species.  I suspect I will be in the minority.",1083715200,20,1185,5.051282051282051
1867466,2,B00008YLVA,"Obviously Computer Generated.  Fades from modern to ancient times to increase length without having to computer generate animals, which I found exceptionally anoying.  Limited on the number of animals shown over and over again.  They even used animals that died out here but not in other places of the world.  That was fine with me.  At least those looked real. Don't waste your time or money on this one.  I expected something more like ""Walking with Dinosaurs"".  Boy was I wrong.

Discovery channel made this longer version.  They sell a shorter version for almost twice the price with half the footage.  I unfortunately purchased both.  I won't buy anything from the Discovery Channel any more.  No way.  I was extremely dissapointed.  Especially with the more expensive but shorter version they sell.  They are the same program.  I expected much more from them.  This was a waste of time and money.  You would never guess they are the same program.  This version comes in a case and contains 2 DVDs with two, 50 minute programs each.  The other has 3 DVDs with about 1 hour each and has a case for each DVD.  Who would have guessed they were the same program.  Even the covers and titles of the programs are different.  Never again.  Even if they are able to make real looking animals in the future.",1068854400,31,1303,4.663716814159292

7987980,3,B00008YLVA,"I enjoy documentaries coming out on prehistoric mammals (since I have a greater interest in them than dinosaurs), and though this is fairly informative the CGI was marginal.  Though the industry has gone to great length to get the dinosaur movement right, the mammals are much more stiff and well..fake.  Also, in this documentary, they use a CGI sequence several times, even in a single episode.  I am guessing this was a budget necessity.  If you are looking for information and interesting tidbits on prehistoric America then this is worthwhile.  If you are also wanting good multiple species interactions like in Walking with Dinosaurs, well keep walking.",1493164800,,659,5.121495327102804

7987983,2,B00008YLVA,It has some really good points the CGI is fabulous the mixing of real and fake animals was really well done although this was a positive it was way overused. The scenery used throughout the shows was absolutely beautiful and the narrator had a peaceful and calm voice. BUT this became an issue this show was so slow all the scenery slowed down any actual information at times and the slow peaceful voice became torture as this documentary droned endlessly on and on and on. The show talks about the land and the animals and the humans at the time but surprising enough despite the continual droning of the narrator interesting facts for even people who aren't into the sciences was nearly non existent. As there is over 400 minutes of this series I'd take it in short doses to avoid going into a coma.,1455926400,2,801,4.531034482758621
7987984,4,B00008YLVA,"It is very interesting, it shows us how north America was.",1430784000,,58,4.363636363636363
7987985,4,B00008YLVA,"""Prehistoric America"" comprises two DVD's.  The first opens with a teaser trailer for ""Walking With Cavemen"" before going to the main production.  There are four episodes on the first DVD:  ""Land of the Mammoth,"" ""Canyon Lands,"" ""Ice Age Oasis"" and ""Edge of the Ice.""

The second DVD opens with a teaser trailer for ""Building the Great Pyramid,"" narrated by Omar Sharif.  There are two episodes on the second DVD: ""American Serengeti"" and ""Mammoths to Manhattan,"" much better than the lesser Doctor Who episode ""Daleks in Manhattan.""  (Sorry, couldn't resist.)

The first show in the series, ""Land of the Mammoth,"" is a suitable illustration of how this presentation works.  It examines the ecology of Beringia, the land mass that existed between Asia and the America in the ice age.  A wind-swept steppe, it hosted grazers from both continents: Long-Horned American Buffalo, Saiga Antelope, American Horses, Musk Oxen, Arctic Hares and, of course, Wooly Mammoths.  Their predators, American Lions and Short-Faced Bear, were there, too.

This series utilizes the latest finds in paleontology.  Using predator wounds on frozen carcasses and the dentition of Mammoths, and such, it builds a study of the world that existed then.  After that, the show presents a day in the life of Beringia, using the data that it has built up earlier.  This same pattern is used in five of the other episodes.  The last one is a summation that brings us up to the world of today.

For example, in ""Ice Age Oasis,"" the animals that come together are those of South America: Llamas, Cabybaras and Glyptodonts; and North America: Mastodons and American Buffalo.  Due to the pattern, there is a certain amount of repetition, but it serves a purpose to set up each show.  The CGI is pretty good, not always perfect, but good enough.  I would imagine that these series do not have unlimited budgets, and this one certainly did well with what it had.

Especially considering the price and all the extras, ""Prehistoric America"" is quite the bargain.  Watching it will help you learn about a vanished America.  There is, also, a certain sadness involved.  As it shows, there was a brief time when there were the hunting artifacts of the people who came from Asia and the remains of the wondrous, giant beasts of the Americas.  Then, there are no longer any traces of the large animals that roamed our land.  It shows how small bands of hominid hunters can completely alter the ecology of a continent.

The second DVD, also, contains a slew of extra features: British shows ""Grand Canyon: From Dinosaurs to Dams"" and ""Everglades: To Hell and Back,"" both narrated by Tim Pigott-Smith, along with a Photo Gallery and a Fact File with information on the various animals featured in ""Prehistoric America.

In addition, there are a slew of trailers and previews under Special Features: Sir David Attenborough's ""The Life of Mammals"" and ""The Blue Planet: Seas of Life,"" ""Building the Great Pyramid,"" ""Walking with Cavemen,"" ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"" and ""Walking with Dinosaurs/Allosaurus.""

7987986,5,B00008YLVA,"I haven't yet had a chance to view the DVD but it looks very interesting (the graphics look amazing) and I look forward to doing so.  I have always been very interested in Ice Age megafauna - usually the remarkable creatures that lived in my home country of Australia.  However, those of America are also quite awesome, and from when I was a kid I was always intrigued by the La Brea tar pits.  I anticipated the DVD to be a single documentary but I was pleasantly surprised to discover that there are several on it, totalling up to about five hours of viewing.  This DVD is fantastic value!",1410134400,,591,4.394495412844036
