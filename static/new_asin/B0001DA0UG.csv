1989676,5,B0001DA0UG,"Whoo boy, I thought the diving helmet and gorilla costume from 'Robot Monster' was bad. Check out this winged terror! Remember the vulture from the Bugs Bunny cartoons? Rememebr the real stupid one who always go 'Aw nope nope nope nope'. Well now imagine him as a terrifying creature from outer space that eats people, destroys airplanes, and topples New York City. Uh, yeah.

Supposedly this thing can fly without being detected by radar. That's because he's from an 'anti-matter dimension' and he generates his own force field. This leaves him impervious to missles, bombs, and rockets. However, it lays eggs and the eggs can be shot with a rifle. Go figure.

The plot is really nothing more than 'Oh my God! There's a giant bird attacking the world!'. There's a whole lot of kooky 50's Sci-Fi mumbo jumbo talking about science that makes no sense, an over zealous military general, a so-so leading lady, and our star the chicken buzzard. It looks like a child's project gone horribly wrong. You can't help but to laugh watching this.",1123459200,9,1036,4.814606741573034
1989677,5,B0001DA0UG,"The Giant Claw is definitely one of the best Sci-Fi B Films of the 1950's. Starring Jeff Morrow and Mara Corday. Jeff Morrow portrays a test pilot who is testing a new device on a vintage jet fighter aircraft in an Arctic Circle U.S.Airforce base During mid flight he sees a gigantic shawdow ""the size of a battleship"" which bypasses his aircraft and radioes his base and a couple of jet interceptors scramble to intercept the gigantic flying object, but neither the base nor the scrambled interceptors radars show anything. The gorgeous looking Mara Corday portrays Morrow's co-worker and scientist monitoring Morrow's test flight. Morrow is ""put on the rug"" by the base military who believe Morrow caused a false alarm. Their suspicions dissipate as sightings of the huge flying object are reported from elsewhere, however the huge object is never detected by radar. Finally during one of the sightings the flying object becomes visible as terrified onlookers see a gargantuan size bird who proceeds to dive and engulf people destroy buildings and destroys or downs flying aircraft. Air force interceptors are powerless and are destroyed in considerable numbers, against the huge bird as their bullets and rockets bounce off some sort of ""deflector protective shield"" covering the bird.
Time is running out for humanity as scientists and U.S.Airforce brass work franctically to find a way for anti-aircraft proyectiles and missiles to penetrate the bird's defensive shield and pierce his skin.
Special effects in this movie are not of a very good quality and the gigantic bird from outer space,built by mexican films industry special effects model people, looks like a huge flying black feathered turkey with claws. However this film is definitely a typical and outstanding Saturday matinee classic gold ""B"" movie of the late 50's, which will surely become one of your favorites. A must have in every Sci-Fi collection. Unfortunately this film has been discontinued and right now is not available, but it will surely resurface again,most likely on DVD format, due to its popularity with collectors who demand its presence in the market.",1079395200,14,2138,5.164265129682997
1989678,5,B0001DA0UG,This is the funiest creatur feature I have ever seen is just great with possibly the worst monster ever put on film I know any cult or horror fan will love this movie so check out you won't be sorry,1077494400,3,198,3.975
1989679,3,B0001DA0UG,"When I saw this picture, I was amazed at the meager budget Columbia Pictures set for it. They knew that this movie would lay an egg.
I purchased it years ago, why, because it was escapism, low brow suspend logic entertainment. Columbia put next nothing into making Giant Claw, yet manage to make money on this exercise in cheapness. If you can turn off your brain for a while, it is so bad  it is quiet tolerable.",1384819200,,413,4.363636363636363
1989680,2,B0001DA0UG,"The film starts out with the standard sci-fi introduction of how radar can track down anything.  Of course there might be a few holes of the radar coverage; however these holes can be fixed by pilots flying around and checking out the area.

One such pilot (Jeff Morrow) spots a UFO ""big as a battleship,"" and does not show up on radar.  Throughout the film everyone thinks he is ditzy but still allows him to call the shots.  As you will soon find out this is the generic mysterious monster movie with all the standard characters and clich plots of the sci-fi of the time.

The story turns out to be murder most fowl with an antimatter twist.

This might have been a fun science fiction movie if the hokey monster did not look so cute; he is even cuter than the heroine (Mara Corday.)

One of the DVD extras tells the story of how the actors never saw the monster until the film was finished.",1383955200,,893,4.343373493975903
1989681,1,B0001DA0UG,"""The Giant Claw"" is a monster film from 1957. Although somewhat dragging, it *could* have worked, had it not been for one rather decisive detail: the monster. It's so bizarrely bad, that I felt embarrassed watching it - not the feeling you want when you devour a turkey. The director is supposed to be embarrassed, not you!

Even worse, the monster *is* a turkey, a quite literal, flying monster turkey the size of a battleship, protected by a shield of anti-matter??!! Or is it an alien turkey vulture? Or an ""overgrown buzzard"", to quote one of the brave soldiers sent out to destroy this latest threat to the American way of life, and, I suppose, the Endangered Species Act?

No matter the species, the birdie is both hungry and angry at humanity, and soon threatens both the Manhattan skyline and the rest of the world with complete annihilation. In one of those usual bouts of illogical of which C-movies are full, the eggs of the exotic thunderbird turn out to be vulnerable to ordinary gunfire, so *that* problem is quickly disposed of.

Apparently, ""The Giant Claw"" was so underfinanced, that parts of the movie reuses footage from three other science fiction films! But sure, only nerds can spot *that*. Everyone can see the monster - everyone, apparently, but the actors. They didn't see the mutant grouse until the movie premiered, causing them eternal shame and embarrassment. They have my deep sympathy and understanding. Even a cosmic blackbird (Icteridae) would have been far scarier than this...

One star - or five stars, if you like turkey shooting, LOL.",1377216000,,1572,4.876404494382022
1989682,5,B0001DA0UG,"i really enjoy the old clasic movies, even the ones in black and white, it makes you think what could be out there in outer space!! you know U.F.O.s and all, but i do love sci-fi. stuf, thanks again..",1363132800,,200,4.153846153846154
1989683,1,B0001DA0UG,"According to the cast members of 1957's THE GIANT CLAW, the movie was filmed without them knowing what the monster looked like.  When leading man Jeff Morrow saw the film, the audience burst into laughter each time the monster appeared on screen, and he slipped out a side door before he could be recognized.

There is a notion that PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is the worst film ever made, but in actual truth there are quite a few that are much worse, and THE GIANT CLAW is one of them.  Producer Sam Katzman was notorious for grade-z movies, with more than two hundred flicks that ranged from the cheap explotation to the worst of Elvis Presley.  Along the way he made several horror movies, most infamously THE WEREWOLF, ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU, THE CREATURE WITH THE ATOMIC BRAIN, and perhaps most ludicrously THE GIANT CLAW.  In this drive-in flop, a group of scientists are unnerved when an aircraft is attacked by a OOFO--an out of focus object.  Time passes and it transpires the OOFO is not a UFO but a big bird marionette made in Mexico.  Yes, one can well understand why the audience burst into laughter at the premiere.

It seems that this is a bird from another world, and it is protected by a shield of anti-mater (don't ask why it doesn't blow up when it comes into contact with matter), and it is probably here on earth to build a nest and lay eggs.  There's lots of stock footage, lots of people running and screaming in shots pulled from EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, and lots of wires showing whenever the bird is on camera.  The movie ends as we knew it would all along and the audience is left to stagger in ennui.  Yes, I suppose there are a few giggles to be gained from this flick, expecially when you see the bird, which looks a bit like Phyllis Diller hung over and without a wig.  But the simple truth is that most bad movies are simply bad, and this is one of that variety.

1989684,5,B0001DA0UG,"THE GIANT CLAW is yet another of those disastrous lovable Creature Feature classics that's so bad it's nearly great. This time, Earth is threatened by something ""the size of a flying battleship"" that has Stealth capability and an antimatter shield around it that absorbs any and all ballistic projectiles fired at it. Instead of it being a giant high-tech spacecraft, it's a giant low-tech avian squawking something-or-other from Who Knows Where with a thyroid problem and bad teeth that looks like your Thanksgiving Dinner run amuck.

Beware as it swoops out of the sky to eat people, cars, tanks, and the film's scriptwriter. Too bad it didn't eat the Special Effects people first, but, then again, if it had, we wouldn't have THE GIANT CLAW to laugh at. Fortunately, the busty Mara Corday saves the day just by being the busty Mara Corday. God, I love this kind of movie!",1303257600,,874,4.826666666666667
1989685,3,B0001DA0UG,"I am a Sci-fi Lover from way back in the mid 50's when I went to the Saturday movies! This movie..""The Giant Claw"" was one that I remember seeing twice because I liked it soooooo much! I have looked for this movie for years, but could never remember the name of it until I ran across it on Amazon! They say you can never go back...........well I guess in some ways that is true. As I remembered this movie as being more scarey then it really is. Now is seems kind of silly and tame to me, but as a 10 year old...it gave me some Big Thrills! I still do recommend it as it is different then most 50's Science Fiction movies. Not really Great Big....special effects, but still a novel idea and I remember being very scared of that BIG BIRD...swoping down and grabbing me on my way back home after the movies. I also remember the Bird's caugh, caugh, caugh sound for along time. KIDS...what did we know? But all in all........go for it. Great popcorn and Fun movie!",1216598400,,961,4.285714285714286

This movie is frightening for about 30 seconds. The minute you get a look at this bird...! And the model work makes some of the Japanese Gozilla movies look stupendous! The Giant Gila Monster is bad (the movie, not the creature). This thing transcends bad all the way back to good. If you're into 50's era sci-fi, or you just love a good, bad movie (or like me you're both)This movie is a must see! Let the kids see it. They won't believe we actually paid to see this. Any movie that is so bad it sticks in your mind for over 40 years can't be missed.",1128211200,4,802,4.141025641025641

8010238,5,B0001DA0UG,"Oh boy! My wife ran across this one at random on TV and though I had a ton of work to do with my writing and stuff, I couldn't resist. Ive probably seen it before but it was so long ago, I don't remember most of it. I wonder why???

This was a real cheapo as far as special effects. Okay, the acting wasn't exactly Oscar material either. The dialogue came close to the Robot Monster/Ed Wood school, but it was at least a few notches above that. Also, the science added a bit more worthy legitimacy to material that was of course, completely shot down by the rest of the cheesy effects and script.

A lot of the actors looked vaguely familiar. Some were so relatively young, I probably would know them immediately in a more mature role. The older ones maybe in a different role. Doesnt matter.

This movie was pure B-movie nirvana, a perfect subject for Mystery Science Theater. It may have been one of their features, for all I know. This is the stuff I live for! The best part, of course, besides the plastic model airplanes and the toy trains was the google-eyed Muppet bird monster. Wow! How scary!

Folks, Im still trembling in my socks. Highly recommended.",1450396800,2,1161,4.436619718309859
8010239,5,B0001DA0UG,"""The Giant Claw"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. Let me qualify that statement. It is a terrible sci-fi giant creature thriller from 1957 about a turkey vulture from outer space that is terrorizing the Earth. The special effects on this film will make your jaw drop no matter how many comically terrible movies you've seen. The film works as great entertainment in a ""so bad it's good"" way because of the absolute sincerity of the performers and the stern and ponderous tone of the script. Much of the dialogue is beyond hilarious, and the science mumbo-jumbo and flying lingo in particular are astonishing. I love the concept of an ""antimatter screen"", the reason for the bird's imperviousness to radar, the entire concept of ""atomic spitballs"", and occasional bouts of almost completely nonsensical dialogue delivered in a deadly serious manner. My favorite line is from star Jeff Morrow, who contemplates being the only pilot to survive an encounter with the creature thusly: ""That makes me chief cook and bottle washer in a one-man birdwatcher's society."" What?

I have seen ""The Giant Claw"" a number of times, and was an early purchaser of the film on VHS: fortunately it is now also available on DVD though as part of the ""Sam Katzman 'Icons of Horror Collection'"", which I highly recommend if you have any interest in 1950s sci-fi or horror films. This turkey is a pleasure to see again and again, and is particularly fun watching it with like-minded friends. This is a must-see film for anyone who loves B-movies: truly a classic of special effects underachievement, I guarantee that if you watch ""The Giant Claw"" you will never forget the beak from outer space!",1449014400,3,1679,4.870629370629371

8010242,3,B0001DA0UG,"An electrical engineer flying a fighter jet is buzzed by a giant bird while calibrating a radar station in Alaska.  He is not believed until other crashes occur, including his own transport back to New York.  He and his gal pal mathematician help the authorities come up with a meson particle cannon to defeat the bird's antimatter shield and allow it to be killed.

There is a mix of 1950's US Air Force planes in stock footage that lacks any continuity to type when edited together.  There's also shots of Canadian CF-100's taking off.  The model work is fair to poor, with a C-54 substitute that's very simplified.  The B-25 with the tail cannon is better, but stock shots are also lifted from Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.  Rockets from the plane finish off the bird, and I understand the B-25H/PBJ-1H did carry HVAR during WW2.",1414886400,,829,4.675862068965517

What really stands out is just how bad the dialog is. This is an awful movie, but it's a black and white sci fi film from the 1950s, so it's worth a look.
