3140330,4,B00153ZQR8,"Super Pocoyo is a collection of small Pocoyo episodes which are great for kids with small attention spans or just as something quick to watch.  In Pocoyo there is a narrator that talks but other than that the characters only make a few sounds/words every now and then.  It is a cute and simple show great for preschoolers.  My 2 year old actually cracked up when watching this DVD and then I laughed because I couldn't figure out what he was laughing at!  The animation is bright, colorful and full of fun shapes but as far as a plot goes there really isn't one.  The show just has Pocoyo and his friends doing simple tasks and small adventures.  It is not really meant to be educational but rather ""learning through laughter"" and showing friendship.",1292803200,4,750,4.559701492537314
3140331,5,B00153ZQR8,"es, this kid's name is Pocoyo. It looks much harder to say than it really is (trust me, Moose can say it, so can you). And, yes, I'll admit when I received my first Pocoyo movie, I wasn't too impressed at first glance. However, it's a really cute show. And a pretty big hit! You can even get Pocoyo bath figures.

We received a copy of Super Pocoyo for review. My boys loved it, just like they do their other two Pocoyo DVDs. The animation is pretty simple, the plots aren't too demanding. I personally like that it's not a loud show with a lot of action. I prefer my boys' shows to be pretty simple, if not educational. Pocoyo is educational but not like Blue's Clues or Sesame Street. It's more like it's subtitle: Learning Through Laughter.

This title is not up for release until January 11, 2011 so if you're looking for a nice present for your kids for after the New Year (perhaps so you can rest on the couch while they watch), I highly recommend this. I trust Pocoyo to entertain my children with fun and learning unlike so many kids' shows these days.",1292284800,,1060,4.348484848484849

This seller is consistently great:  good communication and on-time shipping, with very competitive prices.  I find myself choosing this seller over others that might have slightly lower prices.

Pocoyo is ACTUALLY for children, as opposed to shows that have adult humor couched in silly characters.  It's amazingly silly, well written and produced.",1341532800,,473,5.24
3140347,5,B00153ZQR8,"We have a 3 1/2 year old that spends some time in our home. We catch the 10 minute episodes of Pocoyo on PBS on occasion, and he just loves them, but they only come on twice a day. I thought it would be fun to have a video for rainy or boring days in the house. We really enjoyed this dvd. The cartoon is quite cute, entertaining, and fun, even for adults. The stories are short, so they keep the kids' attention, and they always have a wonderful little moral (like sharing, working together, helping a friend, etc.). And, unlike some of the popular cartoons or shows, they're not annoying or tiresome for adults to watch. I have shown this show to several children, both boys and girls, and ages 6 months to 5 years, and they all enjoy this show. I purchased 4 Pocoyo dvds at once, and ended up giving two of them to a girlfriend who has a toddler and runs a child day care from her home, and she and her kids love them, as well! And again, they range in age from a few months old to almost kindergarten. She loves that, on a rainy or housebound day, it catches and keeps the kids' attention, they laugh, play along, and really enjoy the stories.

I didn't notice when I was considering purchasing this dvd, but there are several stories/skits on each dvd, which adds up to an hour (or more) per dvd. I wasn't certain, since the shows are only 10 minutes on tv, so that's why I purchased 4 dvds. But, since they are each so long and have so many shows on each one, that is why I gifted two of them to my friend. I knew her kids would enjoy them and she would make good use of them.

It's highly educational, fun, colorful and more!  I figured all Mommy's need to know about ""Word World"" too.  ;)",1333411200,,440,4.011494252873563

She can tell me if he is angry, happy, etc. And all with few if any words on the DVD.

3140358,5,B00153ZQR8,"Pocoyo is an animated series that comes from Spain (though you can't tell by the english version).  Fortunately for this series of cute 7 minute episodes, the english version is narrated by the incredibly talented Stephen Fry.

Pocoyo has a very cute toddler voice (when he speaks!), and the narrator tells most of the story, often through talking to Pocoyo and friends.  Most of the time curious Pocoyo interacts with his friends Duck, Elly the Elephant, Loula the dog, and Sleepy Bird as they do things like flying an airplane, going camping, and playing hide and seek.

The educational side of TV shows are important to me, and this one educates very subtly.  It teaches my 3 year old about friendship, loyalty, sharing, caring, and more.

It has simple 3D animation with a white background, witty storytelling and exceptional narration, and great characters. I absolutely love it too because it's so clever and adorable.

Example from Super Pocoyo:
(Pocoyo runs across screen with Zorro type mask on)
Stephen Fry: Theeeere's Pocoyo.  Hello, Pocoyo!
(Pocoyo screeches to a stop, is gesturing with closed eyes, doesn't answer)
Stephen Fry: Pocoyo. (no response) Pocoyo!
Pocoyo: No!
Stephen Fry: No what, Pocoyo?
Pocoyo: Not Pocoyo!
Stephen Fry: ""You're *not* Pocoyo?
(Pocoyo nods no)
Stephen Fyry: Well then, who are you?
(Pocoyo points to his chest, which has a superhero P on it, accompanied by sound effects)
Stephen Fry says, ""Can any of you tell me what Pocoyo is today?""
(Pocoyo strikes a superhero pose)
Kids voices say, ""He's a Super Hero!""

As a side note, Pocoyo - Musical Blocks, not on here, is my favorite Pocoyo.  You can see it on Youtube, linked from the Pocoyo site, along with many other Pocoyo videos if you would like a preview.",1311033600,5,1750,4.901694915254238
3140359,5,B00153ZQR8,"The kids are crazy about these and want to watch them over and over and over and....you know how they are. This one is super because it has 12 episodes, which is more than most other disks.",1301184000,5,189,4.135135135135135
3140360,5,B00153ZQR8,"I bought our first Pocoyo DVD after seeing a Pocoyo cartoon with my 4 year old nephew while on vacation. He was mesmerized, which surprised me because he is a very energetic child.

I bought this one because of how much he enjoyed the first one (till he ""lost"" it), and he's going through a superhero craze right now. This DVD is broken up into 8-10 smaller stories. Running time is about an hour and a half, though you can choose how much of it your child watches from the menu. You can play them all or select individual ones.

The stories are very simple to understand, and are done with almost no dialogue (all are narrated). Pocoyo and his friends perform simpler tasks, play make believe, and have small adventures. It's all very gentle, but not boring. There is excitement in the color palette (bright characters on a white background), in the music, and in Pocoyo's mannerisms. The emotions taught are realistic, as are the reactions of his friends.

Overall, I think this a great DVD for little kids. As I said, my nephew who will be 5 in June watched the whole DVD through twice in a day. His favorite episodes were ""Super Pocoyo"" and ""Pocoyo juggles."" Enjoy - it's worth it!",1299542400,4,1185,4.52803738317757
3140361,5,B00153ZQR8,"My 3 year old son loves Pocoyo. We don't watch much TV, but saw this on ""Noggin"" as a short clip some time back.  I purchased one DVD since he wanted to watch the ""clip"" more than the show we had recorded for him, and we enjoyed them so much we have collected 3 more DVD's since then.

Pocoyo is a toddler (3 years old or so), and as such, he says very few words (and rare-to-none as far as full sentences go) therefore, toddlers and children of various age ranges will be able to easily relate to him --no matter where their developing language abilities/skills may currently be (though as an adult reviewer, I also found his stories refreshing, and entertaining, lol!)  Pocoyo's actions are clear, and his stories always come out with a ""positive lesson learned"" (I always watch DVD's alone first to ""approve"" before allowing my toddler to watch, and I saw no crying, no temper tantrums, nor any ""general bad behavior"" in these DVD's).

This aspect of the DVD content is very important to me, (& one reason we don't watch reg TV), because as most Moms/Dads know: Shows with *EXAMPLED-THEN-CORRECTED* BAD BEHAVIOR: USUALLY TEACH THE BAD BEHAVIOR INSTEAD OF THE ""LESSON"" INTENDED to most children (child psych will tell any TV show producer that a child's mind was designed to reach their ""end-goals"" & survive -and aren't mature enough to be cognizant of, much less capable of ""FIXING"" an anxiety/behavioral issue)  Unfortunately, an adult's mind may see a ""lesson"" to be derived from the show, but a child witnessing the initial shocking ""bad behavior"", will likely store the memory in the back of their minds, and continued viewing of such shows will allow continued decline of their accepted ""standards of behavior"" no matter what Mom & Dad tell them are appropriate.  But, even if only considering the short-term effects, viewing a respected character the child loves and wants to emulate, in the act of hitting, yelling, or throwing a temper-tantrum (regardless of the later correction of the behavior) will make some serious heartache (and headache) for Mom/Dad who can't understand where the ""undesirable behavior"" is suddenly coming from.  (YES --I'm talking about you: --> NH,K-L & YoGG! <--!!!)

Back from the short diversion into reasons it could be a good idea to buy DVDs like this one, vs. the potential pitfalls of watching live (or un-parental reviewed) TV shows and commercials and back to the review itself ;)  --There is also a very nice ""narrator"" (father/adult type -voice only) who speaks directly to Pocoyo and slightly less commonly to two other characters (a duck and an elephant --who obviously also say very little, but like all of the characters, they are also very animated and easily ""read"") from time-to-time.  This narrator sometimes ""clarifies"" what is happening, or may give some foreshadowing at times, but always in a child friendly way.

Overall it's a lighthearted, well rounded set of entertaining lessons in short-story format (several short episodes in general: ~7 min(+/-), which is helpful for young attention spans), very cute (contains no ""undesirable behavior"" to emulate), and very entertaining.",1298332800,3,3143,4.990439770554493

The only tiff i have with it is it take WAY TOO LONG to get to the Pocoyo Clips because they over filled it with clips pushing other PBS shows, etc.  PS - I'd also recommend the entire Word World collection.  It's highly educational, fun, colorful and more!  I figured all Mommy's need to know about ""Word World"" too.  ;)",1333411200,,440,4.011494252873563

My grand daughter who has SPD laughs aloud more at this DVD than any other. Also she mimics Pocoyo's expressions.  She can tell me if he is angry, happy, etc. And all with few if any words on the DVD.

3374855,5,B00153ZQR8,"Pocoyo is an animated series that comes from Spain (though you can't tell by the english version).  Fortunately for this series of cute 7 minute episodes, the english version is narrated by the incredibly talented Stephen Fry.

Pocoyo has a very cute toddler voice (when he speaks!), and the narrator tells most of the story, often through talking to Pocoyo and friends.  Most of the time curious Pocoyo interacts with his friends Duck, Elly the Elephant, Loula the dog, and Sleepy Bird as they do things like flying an airplane, going camping, and playing hide and seek.

The educational side of TV shows are important to me, and this one educates very subtly.  It teaches my 3 year old about friendship, loyalty, sharing, caring, and more.

It has simple 3D animation with a white background, witty storytelling and exceptional narration, and great characters. I absolutely love it too because it's so clever and adorable.

Example from Super Pocoyo:
(Pocoyo runs across screen with Zorro type mask on)
Stephen Fry: Theeeere's Pocoyo.  Hello, Pocoyo!
(Pocoyo screeches to a stop, is gesturing with closed eyes, doesn't answer)
Stephen Fry: Pocoyo. (no response) Pocoyo!
Pocoyo: No!
Stephen Fry: No what, Pocoyo?
Pocoyo: Not Pocoyo!
Stephen Fry: ""You're *not* Pocoyo?
(Pocoyo nods no)
Stephen Fyry: Well then, who are you?
(Pocoyo points to his chest, which has a superhero P on it, accompanied by sound effects)
Stephen Fry says, ""Can any of you tell me what Pocoyo is today?""
(Pocoyo strikes a superhero pose)
Kids voices say, ""He's a Super Hero!""

As a side note, Pocoyo - Musical Blocks, not on here, is my favorite Pocoyo.  You can see it on Youtube, linked from the Pocoyo site, along with many other Pocoyo videos if you would like a preview.",1311033600,5,1750,4.901694915254238

3374857,5,B00153ZQR8,"I bought our first Pocoyo DVD after seeing a Pocoyo cartoon with my 4 year old nephew while on vacation. He was mesmerized, which surprised me because he is a very energetic child.

I bought this one because of how much he enjoyed the first one (till he ""lost"" it), and he's going through a superhero craze right now. This DVD is broken up into 8-10 smaller stories. Running time is about an hour and a half, though you can choose how much of it your child watches from the menu. You can play them all or select individual ones.

The stories are very simple to understand, and are done with almost no dialogue (all are narrated). Pocoyo and his friends perform simpler tasks, play make believe, and have small adventures. It's all very gentle, but not boring. There is excitement in the color palette (bright characters on a white background), in the music, and in Pocoyo's mannerisms. The emotions taught are realistic, as are the reactions of his friends.

Overall, I think this a great DVD for little kids. As I said, my nephew who will be 5 in June watched the whole DVD through twice in a day. His favorite episodes were ""Super Pocoyo"" and ""Pocoyo juggles."" Enjoy - it's worth it!",1299542400,4,1185,4.52803738317757
3374858,5,B00153ZQR8,"My 3 year old son loves Pocoyo. We don't watch much TV, but saw this on ""Noggin"" as a short clip some time back.  I purchased one DVD since he wanted to watch the ""clip"" more than the show we had recorded for him, and we enjoyed them so much we have collected 3 more DVD's since then.

Pocoyo is a toddler (3 years old or so), and as such, he says very few words (and rare-to-none as far as full sentences go) therefore, toddlers and children of various age ranges will be able to easily relate to him --no matter where their developing language abilities/skills may currently be (though as an adult reviewer, I also found his stories refreshing, and entertaining, lol!)  Pocoyo's actions are clear, and his stories always come out with a ""positive lesson learned"" (I always watch DVD's alone first to ""approve"" before allowing my toddler to watch, and I saw no crying, no temper tantrums, nor any ""general bad behavior"" in these DVD's).

This aspect of the DVD content is very important to me, (& one reason we don't watch reg TV), because as most Moms/Dads know: Shows with *EXAMPLED-THEN-CORRECTED* BAD BEHAVIOR: USUALLY TEACH THE BAD BEHAVIOR INSTEAD OF THE ""LESSON"" INTENDED to most children (child psych will tell any TV show producer that a child's mind was designed to reach their ""end-goals"" & survive -and aren't mature enough to be cognizant of, much less capable of ""FIXING"" an anxiety/behavioral issue)  Unfortunately, an adult's mind may see a ""lesson"" to be derived from the show, but a child witnessing the initial shocking ""bad behavior"", will likely store the memory in the back of their minds, and continued viewing of such shows will allow continued decline of their accepted ""standards of behavior"" no matter what Mom & Dad tell them are appropriate.  But, even if only considering the short-term effects, viewing a respected character the child loves and wants to emulate, in the act of hitting, yelling, or throwing a temper-tantrum (regardless of the later correction of the behavior) will make some serious heartache (and headache) for Mom/Dad who can't understand where the ""undesirable behavior"" is suddenly coming from.  (YES --I'm talking about you: --> NH,K-L & YoGG! <--!!!)

Back from the short diversion into reasons it could be a good idea to buy DVDs like this one, vs. the potential pitfalls of watching live (or un-parental reviewed) TV shows and commercials and back to the review itself ;)  --There is also a very nice ""narrator"" (father/adult type -voice only) who speaks directly to Pocoyo and slightly less commonly to two other characters (a duck and an elephant --who obviously also say very little, but like all of the characters, they are also very animated and easily ""read"") from time-to-time.  This narrator sometimes ""clarifies"" what is happening, or may give some foreshadowing at times, but always in a child friendly way.

Overall it's a lighthearted, well rounded set of entertaining lessons in short-story format (several short episodes in general: ~7 min(+/-), which is helpful for young attention spans), very cute (contains no ""undesirable behavior"" to emulate), and very entertaining.",1298332800,3,3143,4.990439770554493
