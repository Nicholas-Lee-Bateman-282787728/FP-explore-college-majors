2469806,5,B000CQQI9E,"I'm not a huge fan of movies about hit men, but this one really sucked me in and kept me absorbed for its full two hours of nonstop action. A mix of thriller and police procedural, this film by Flemish director Erik Van Looy is clever, intelligent, and compelling as any Helen Mirren ""Prime Suspect."" There is wit and some broad humor, and it recalls at times the finest suspense sequences in Alfred Hitchcock, managing to keep our sympathies with both the young police investigators *and* the aging hit man they are pursuing - quite a trick. An added twist is that the hit man in question is suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's, which alters his perception of what is going on around him as well as his memory.

The performances in the film are excellent, especially the amazing Jan Decleir as the killer, and the cinematography and editing perfectly reflect the complexity of the intertwining threads of plot. The soundtrack is drivingly strident (sounds like beating on trash cans) and creepy by turns. And BMW owners may wish that the film didn't make so much of a malicious practical joke directed as unerringly at them as the laser beam that shines from the hit man's gun.",1165536000,3,1189,4.688995215311005

But when the child ends up dead anyway, he starts on a journey of vendetta that implicates some very important people.  On his tail were Antwerp's  Detectives Vincke and Verstuyft.

However,he agrees to complete one last job, at least until he discovers his target is a 12 year old girl.

2469810,4,B000CQQI9E,"""The Memory of a Killer"", a new Belgian film, received a very limited theatrical release buoyed by positive reviews from Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper. The film was recently released on DVD prompting Ebert and Roeper to profile it again, so I rented it.

Angelo Ledda (Jan De Cleir) is a professional hit man and after years of fulfilling various contracts, he finds himself at a crossroads. Experiencing the first stages of Alzheimer's, he writes important information of his arm; hotel name, room number, contacts, name of his hit. Arriving in Antwerp, he meets with his new employer and goes about his first assignment, the City Planner. Vincke (Koen De Bouw) and Verstufyt (Werner De Smedt), two of the top detectives, and seemingly the only honest cops, in the Antwerp police department, uncover a child prostitution ring and save a 13 year old girl from her father. Soon, the paths of these characters will cross.

""The Memory of a Killer"" shows great promise. The first two thirds of the film are effectively tense as we follow the two different storylines, watching as they move closer and closer to one another. The more interesting story belongs to Ledda, the contract killer. As he attempts to survive with his new condition, the character actually manages to make us feel empathy towards him, even as he sets out to fulfill his contracts and kill people. We begin to care for this person because he is experiencing something terrifying, something we could all, at some point, experience; the onset of Alzheimer's.

As Ledda goes about his job, we see evidence of his skill. Even dealing with the disease, he proves to be a scary guy. Brief moments of memory loss temporarily disorient him, but he quickly refocuses and finishes the task at hand. Even with this disease, he proves to be ruthless, efficient and quite good at his job. It would be terrifying to watch him working at the height of his powers. Jan De Cleir is quite good as the aging assassin. His intensity is a good match for the effects of the disease.

Less effective, director Erik Van Looy employs a number of camera angles, movements and editing tricks to convey Ledda's vision of the disease. So for each of these brief moments of memory loss, we see a quick barrage of camera angles, grainy film, quick zooms and the like. Instead of adequately conveying the character's feelings, these sequences resemble a bad music video or the fight sequences from the old ""Batman"" television series. They serve to remove us from the story, drawing attention to the fact we are watching a film.

Vincke and Verstufyt are also interesting. The Belgium equivalent of Riggs and Murtaugh (""Lethal Weapon"") or any other cop/ buddy duo in American films, they follow pretty closely to the rule book, the rule book all movie detectives/ cops follow. Honest to a ""T"", they are the type of cops who obsess over any unsolved case. After they rescue the 13 year old girl, Vincke becomes a guardian angel to her, watching out for her welfare, from a distance.

When the two stories merge, we suddenly see how all of the different plot points click into place. What part does the 13 year old girl play? The City Planner? What is the connection between the people Ledda is hired to kill? The story seems complicated, but everything has been laid out for us. If you pay attention, everything will make sense.

The final act is a disappointment. After a tense game of cat and mouse, with the detectives always a foot behind Ledda, the story abruptly changes, thrusting all three characters into an extended situation. The change is too abrupt and doesn't work well with the rest of the story.

The first two thirds of ""Killer"" creates a genuine level of suspense, despite the fact the film is clearly the work of a director who loves American films. ""Killer"" almost seems a homage to the films he loves, yanking bits and pieces from other films and tying them all together. During the last act, the film falls apart because it can't maintain everything it has going; suspense, character study, action, homage to American films. This is unfortunate because the last half hour drags and this hurts our impression of the film, leaving us with a slightly marred memory of the story. Perhaps this is the director's way of imposing a little of Ledda's life upon us.",1141689600,6,4314,4.765729585006693
2469811,5,B000CQQI9E,"'De Zaak Alzheimer' or 'The Alzheimer Case' or the US titled 'The Memory of a Killer' is a stunningly well written, directed, acted, and photographed film from Belgium.  Though termed by director Erik Van Looy as a 'police thriller', this gripping drama is so much more: this is the story of organized crime, of the men and women who fight crime, and of a man afflicted with progressive Alzheimer's Disease which alters his entire view of his life of crime.  It is a police thriller with a soul and as such is one of the finest films of this genre this viewer has ever seen.

Angelo Ledda (the enormously gifted Jan Decleir) is a hit man sent to Antwerp to eliminate some important 'clients'.  He is hesitant to take on the job as he understands that his mind is being slowly altered by the effects of Alzheimer's disease.  But go he must and after his first successful 'kill', he is ordered to kill a young girl, an order he cannot follow, and an order, which with his failing memory and abilities acknowledged, he decides to turn on his employers and rid the world of those big crime magnates.  The Flemish police, lead by two superb minds - Vincke (Koen De Bouw) and Verstuyft (Werner De Smedt) - follow the path of corpses that lay in Ledda's wake of destroying the important heads of crime in Antwerp.  Ledda becomes strangely connected and committed to the two police, in reality helping them by remote stance do their job, but the movie is a cat and mouse chase between the police and Ledda and one whose ending, though somewhat predictable, manages to tear at the heart of the audience as the unwinding of Ledda's mind by Alzheimer's disease results in a metamorphosis of a killer's mentality to that of a quasi-hero.

Brilliantly photographed by Danny Elsen and accompanied by an electrifying musical score by Stephen Warbeck  THE MEMORY OF A KILLER is a taut, tense, unnerving, and fascinating tale told to perfection by Carl Joos' screenplay based on Jef Geeraerts' novel.  There isn't a weak link here - every actor is superb and the performance by Jan Decleir is the stuff of which legends are made.  Recommended without reservation.

2469825,4,B000CQQI9E,I would highly recommend seeing this movie. Definitely an interesting take on the life of a paid assassin (hit man) and he's all business (brutal).

2469829,5,B000CQQI9E,"This is an excellent movie and its too bad its not available to rent. The issue of Alzheimer's slowly closing in on him is done with a such deft directorial hand it leaves the view with a new understanding how confusing and horrifying this disease really is. As he progresses along and his memory blinks like an intermittent neon sign, he is determined to bring down those even more immoral and depraved than he, a cold-blooded hired killer. The pivotal moment that holds such emotional glory amidst a spectacle of terrifying chaos is when he sees that the girl is only 12 - it conjures up a whole spectrum of moral issues about minors (she is a prostitute and an astute one at that) as well as soothes the savagery that threatens the viewer that he could just as easily kill her. This was also present in The Replacement Killers when John Lee (Yun Fat Chow) could not kill the boy, bringing that world down around him, like this. The chase by law enforcement spirals down into a confusing mess and especially dark and droll and drizzling prelude to finale, but the end is killer clarity, no Alzheimer's there, at all. A must see, but pay close attention as it has that Girl with the Dragon Tattoo intensity.",1296864000,2,1208,4.545871559633028
2469830,4,B000CQQI9E,"I've been on a streak as of late. After having seen ""The Question in Their Eyes"" and ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" I figured there couldn't be too many crime thrillers left out there that were of equal caliber but I was wrong. ""The Memory of a Killer"" is a great yarn and it's because, as in the aforementioned films, it draws as much from character as it does from plot.

This is no skin deep thriller. You get to know the main players here and you care for them and their outcomes. It's set in Belgium but seems to draw from France in a way of which I wasn't quite certain. It takes a bit from ""Memento"" in that the main characters in both films have memory problems and need to write things on their person to not let them fade away. That's where the similarity ends.

Here, the main character is a professional hit-man that turns against his employer when he finds out that part of the landscape involves child prostitution. He simply won't go there and won't tolerate it. The two detectives on his tail are in a precarious position in that they need to nab him but he is their guide to a much bigger fish. An uneasy bond is forged as each tries to help the other without blurring professional lines of conduct.

This is a cool flick. It's not just bad guys vs. good guys. Here there is some squabbling going on between various departments and government factions, some of which are in bed with the guy they ultimately want to put behind bars, so things get pretty thick. The viewer knows what should happen but the outcome is by no means certain.

All the production values are top shelf. The acting, directing, editing etc. are all pro level. This is a very good entry into the genre, so if crime thrillers are your poison then this should knock you out.",1288051200,3,1764,4.3689024390243905
2469831,5,B000CQQI9E,Others have discussed the plot so my comments will be short. I saw a preview of the movie and eventually purchased it.

2469842,5,B000CQQI9E,"The Memory of a Killer is a movie in Dutch, (some French too) subtitled in English.

I really like this movie, it is very touching. Jan Decleir is such a great actor!",1271808000,,166,4.1875
2469843,4,B000CQQI9E,"Angelo Ledda (as in Yeats and mythology's swan Leda, he notes) as portrayed by Jan Decleir is a man on the edge. He has spent most of his life as a murderer, most of it paid, some not. But now, as the movie begins, he is in the throes of something way beyond him: Alzheimer's. And for a man who has seemingly always had the details of his life in line during his long, conflicted life...this is not a good thing. Nor is it something that he understands...nor something that he can control. Ledda knows that he is near death and that makes him dangerous and gives him the kind of freedom that only those who are near death possess.
Director Erik Van Looy's ""The Memory of a Killer"" is basically a policier: a film with layer upon layer of storyline that ultimately come together by way of Angelo, D.C.I. Vincke (a wounded, sad-sack performance by Koen de Bouw) who form a sort of bond based on their shared backgrounds of deserted parents, un-successful love affairs and amazing intellect. What's particularly interesting is that this ""relationship"" is formed by way of phone calls and crime scene clues left by Angelo. They don't actually meet until well into the film. Vincke and Ledda share more in life experience than either of than would like to admit and that adds friction and ambiguity that gives this film its substantial bone structure.
There is a very funny and strange scene about mid film in which Ledda wakes up in bed in the throes of an Alzheimer's episode after having sex with a sexy short haired platinum blond, looks around and forgets who she is and what he has just done to her: scary and patently real.
There are many ways in which ""The Memory of a Killer"" reminds me of Helen Mirren's PBS series, ""Prime Suspect"" in that the police are just as messed up psychologically and morally conflicted as the criminals. And this brings a certain verisimilitude to the proceedings: we are after all human, all capable of the best and the worst in human behavior and like Leda: ""mastered by the brute blood in the air.""",1207958400,5,2032,4.5698630136986305
2469844,4,B000CQQI9E,"Interesting but the subject is a bit revolting.  Dealing with Alzheimers was a new twist and the story was well presented.  The European air left me with a bit of a ""who cares"" whim but it was time well spent.",1206489600,,209,4.2
2469845,4,B000CQQI9E,"Set in Belgium, this unusual thriller has as its protagonist an anti-hero--a 57-year old hitman who's beginning to experience symptoms of Alzheimer's. His brother, older and residing in a nursing home, has an advanced form of the same disease. But the hitman, Angelo Ledda, has enough of his wits about him to know what's going on; he does have some slips in memory from time to time, though, and these throw him off, to some extent at least, in the context of remembering what he's just done or where he just was--or who he might have just executed.

The acting is superior; this in combination with a smart storyline with sharp dialogue makes for an engrossing two hours. As is true of many modern noir tales, this one involves corruption in high places, as a result of which murders ensue--some committed by Ledda, some not.

The pacing here is pretty much flawless. The back and forth between the cops, the hitman, and the evil higher-up guys is spot on. This is a great companion piece to the recent French policier ""36 Quai des Orfevres"" directed by Olivier Marechal which, unfortunately, is not available on DVD here in the US, but is available in a non-region 1 European DVD release.

Highly recommended.",1200787200,6,1212,4.734597156398104
2469846,5,B000CQQI9E,"The Memory of a Killer (Erik van Looy, 2003)

How is it that, until I watched this movie, I had never heard the name Jef Geeraerts, upon whose book this movie is based? There is a crime going on here somewhere, and I mean to find it. If the book is a tenth as good as the film, the English-speaking world has been kept in the dark about one of the best crime writers going today. Yeah, I realize that every once in a while mediocre (or just plain bad) novels get made into great movies, but still, I'm playing the odds on this one. Most movies aren't as good as the books on which they're based, and The Memory of a Killer is a very good movie.

Angelo Ledda (the great Jan Decleir) is a French contract killer who is sent to Belgium to take out a minor official after retrieving a certain metal box from him. Once he has completed that assignment, his contact, Seynaeve (Gene Bervoets) orders him out on a related contract: the murder of a child prostitute, Bieke Cuypers (Laurien Van den Broeck). When Ledda discovers Cuypers' age, he refuses to take the contract, saying no one in his profession will kill a child. That night, on the news, he hears she's been shot, and sets out to find out who was behind the murder and why. Meanwhile, Eric Vincke (Koen de Bouw), a Detective Chief Inspector who was assigned to the Cuypers case, is also trying to figure out who killed Bieke Cuypers. When their paths cross, the game of cat and mouse begins-- will Ledda get to each person higher on the food chain before Vincke? And does Vincke really want to stop him? Complicating matters is the fact that Ledda is slowly sliding into Alzheimer's-related dementia.

There are a great many things to love about The Memory of a Killer, but all discussion of how good the film is must start with Jan Decleir, who quite simply owns this role. Decleir is wonderful as Ledda, the aging killer with a conscience. Everything about him is calm, precise, understated... unless it's not, of course. When Ledda's facade shows signs of wear and tear, that's when you can see how excellent a performance this is. Opposite Decleir you have de Bouw, the harried detective, who's not only chasing a killer who's baiting him, but is encountering resistance from places where it doesn't make sense, not least of all his partner. de Bouw's vision of Vincke as the guy who just puts his head down and bulls his way through, damn the torpedoes and full steam ahead, is just as capable as Decleir's vision of Ledda. This would be a great movie if it were just the two of them sitting in an interview room its entire length (viz. Closetland). But there is a plot to go along with it, and that a police procedural can be fresh and inventive in an age of endless Law and Order clones is impressive in itself. That screenwriter Carl Joos drops the biggest plot twist in such a way that you may not even notice how you've been fooled by this script through its entire length is just brilliant.

I'm not sure I can recommend this movie highly enough. If you haven't yet had the chance to see it, do so at your earliest convenience. **** ",1194825600,8,3099,4.448943661971831
2469847,4,B000CQQI9E,"Belgian films are quite rare and so it was for the novelity that I bought 'The Memory of a Killer.' That said I was not disapionted. The story starts with a disturbing scene as the Antwerp Police break a child prostitution racket. A scene in which the child's pimp is her own father. The film then moves on to a French hitman named Angelo Leda, being hired to carry out two murders in Antwerp, which it turns out is his home town. He carries out the first murder, of a corrupt town planner, with the expected professionalism.

His second victim is the thirteen year prostitute rescued earlier by the police. When he sees her and recognises that she is a child, he refuses to carry out the hit. His boss then tries to kill him. When he fails, Leda sets out to kill all those involved in the child prostitution racket.

He may be doing this because he knows he is starting to suffer from Altzemers and he is seeking to redress all the evil things he has done in his life or he may be angry that he has been asked to break his uinderworld code by murdering a child. In a telephone conversation with a Belgian Policeman he says he is killing off these people becasuse the Police cannot, which would tend to the first idea.

I am afraid the Altzemers theme does not really work, Leda may be losing his mind but that does not stop him remaining one step ahead of  both the Police and the underworld. In reality an Altzemers victim would have fallen victim to the Police or the gangsters quite early. It would have been more realistic to have had him suffer fron cancer or some other illness.

Having said that this film is worth a couple of hours of your time and proof that Belgians can make a good gangster film. As a fan of the genre  I hope they make more. All the actors are good and Jan Decleir is great as the hitman. I hope we see of him in the future and I would not complain if he was playing another Belgian gangster.",1192665600,2,1922,4.266483516483516
2469848,5,B000CQQI9E,"This is one of those instances where every part of the filmmaking process comes together to create a true masterpiece. Jan Decleir gives a performance that puts most Hollywood actors or even New-York style method-actors to shame. The film will drag you in in a matter of a very few minutes with a gripping storyline and fast-paced action, dunking you 'in medias res' after barely getting started.
The story unfolds from there, and the first two-thirds or so are so fantastic you won't be able to sit still in your chair... The last part, as has been remarked by a reviewer, is less jam-packed and comparatively less visually compelling (although still good) and may be much better understood and appreciated by Belgians, for whom this storyline is about a decade old and stems from a few sordid trials and their unsavory 'witnesses' with their equally unpleasant stories and accusations.
Be that as it may, the first two thirds to three quarters are Hitchcock-quality moviemaking and will leave you with your mind reeling. You will want to watch it again and appreciate the immense power it has. In intensity it is like having a Slayer concert in your living room, in finesse it's like a great Mozart performance.
