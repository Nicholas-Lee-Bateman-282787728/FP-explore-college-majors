165574,5,0800112652,Hot Stuff is one my favorite movies from the 70's. Great Actors and story. Can't wait til it comes to DVD.,1156809600,3,106,4.095238095238095
165575,5,0800112652,"This was one movie I thought was really goofy.  It's about four Miami police officers who team up together and do a stolen goods sting operation.  It stars Suzanne Pleashette (Newhart, Oh Book II), Jerry Reed (Smokey and the Bandits 1,2,3), Luis Avalos (Stir Crazy, THE ELECTRIC COMPANY on PBS), and of course directed and written and his family in it as well Dom DeLuise, along with Ossie Davis.  Some of the scenes in this movie are pointless but the parts where they have the mafia involved are stupid.  But if you like chases, shooting guns and food fights this is the one to watch.  My favorite part is where Doug (played by Jerry Reed) finds the stolen goods store and when a black man comes in with stolen 35mm cameras and (later this black actor appears in the movie Caddyshack as a bystander fisherman) when Reed says ""You're under arrest"".  The black guys eyes get amazingly BIG like bug eyes.  I thought that was so funny!  And he does that in the movie Caddyshack when the boat that the late Rodney Dangerfield was driving right at him.  But thats another movie.  Anyway, when Doug finds it, he goes to Capt. Guyburger (Davis) and tells him of it and pulls in Louis (Pleashette), and the other two, they bust over 100 and the mafia as well.  I hope that Columbia/Tri-Star will put this out on DVD cause I would definitely like to have it.",1150848000,4,1350,4.491803278688525
165576,5,0800112652,"JERRY REED IS HOTTER THAN HELL BUT, BOUND FOR HEAVEN!! I PRAY WHEN I DIE AND THEN JERRY REED DIES, WE BECOME NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS IN HEAVEN. HEARING JERRY PICK AND SING, TO ME, IS NEXT TO HEAVEN ITSELF!! PLAY ON GUITAR PLAYER, PLAY ON!!

165577,5,0800112652,I remember seeing this movie in the theater as a kid.  Initially my dad took myself and my two brothers to see a different movie but it was no longer running when we got to the theater.  One of the best movies I have seen that my parents had no intention of taking us to.  Plenty of laughs!  I too wish it was available on DVD.  I keep hoping it will happen some day!,1123027200,11,367,3.9054054054054053
165578,5,0800112652,"This is one of the few movies I watched over and over in the theater without the humor, romance, or characters wearing thin.  Everybody in this film did a good job, with just the right mix of dramatic tension and belly laughs.  The chemistry between Pleshette and Reed was wonderful, and the ending (including a final superb touch!) had me on the floor.

It's out on DVD!!!!!!! Hoo blooming RAY!!!!!

One note: there are three movies that, to my knowledge, I've gone to the theater more than three times just to watch it:  Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and this one.

Go ahead! Make my year!!!!!!",1115769600,14,602,4.527777777777778
165579,4,0800112652,"I happen to like this movie, despite how few people have seen it.  It's about a cop (Deluise) who is soon retiring but he has one last job.  He and two partners I believe set up a S.T.I.N.G. operation to catch thieves selling stolen goods.  I'm only 20, so I wasn't even born when this movie was made, ...",1055462400,4,305,4.135593220338983
165580,3,0800112652,"It almost seemsas if this movie was originally written with Burt Reynold in mind, but for some reason he couldn't or wouldn't do it.
They certainly rounded up the Usual Reynolds-Film Suspects -- Jerry Reed, Dom deLuise, Alfie Wise, Pat McCormick and others, and the overall humour has exactly that slightly sardonic, semi-detached air that Burt's raised eyebrow and signature cackle/chuckle (so associated with him that it was used as part of an animated studio logo bit on ""Smokey & the Bandit"") suit so well .
Even without Burt, the cast are an excellent ensemble who play well off each other, delivering the goods quite satisfactorily.
If nothing else, it's definitely an agreeable-enough way to while away an otherwise unfilled hour and a half or so; i don't think this film will fail to entertain, so long as you're not expecting Great Classic Entertainment.
(Look for the then-Mayors of Miami Beach and Miami in cameos -- for a friend who grew up in Miami, they were almost the funniest part of the film.  I won't spoil it for you -- check the end credits, if you don't spot them.  Also, take a close look at the police cars you see charging through the night in one shot)",1033776000,5,1178,4.685990338164252
165581,5,0800112652,Great movie if you feel like having the giggles,1508544000,,47,4.333333333333333
165582,4,0800112652,"An okay film regarding mid level larceny and the police attempting to deal with it.  It's the kind of film that Hollywood used to make a lot of before the big blockbuster ""make or break"" B-movie with a lot of CGI came along to just ruin and otherwise trash the film market and film going experience.

It's not a fantastic film, but it's okay for what it is.  The tech is dated, and the action scenes are so so, but it's a likeable film all the same.  If you're looking for a so-so crime comedy that has some mid range name stars from the 70s, then this film might do it for you.

Check it out once, and see what you think.

I'm just sorry they don't make moderately budgeted films anymore with real looking everyday people actors.",1507593600,,730,4.253623188405797
165583,3,0800112652,I usually like Dom Deluise but in this film he uses bad language a lot and I actually prefer his cleaner language shows more so! I'm a single man (no family of my own) but Cussing doesn't make me laugh and Cannonball Run was still better than this movie!!,1503360000,,255,4.224489795918367

165594,5,0800112652,"If you're looking for Oscar winning acting or a deep plot this isn't it. I love it. The Dom DeLuise scene getting the munchies is one of my favorites. Suzanne Pleshette is a heart throb from my youth. Typical yelling police boss formula. Simple plot line of a buying stolen goods sting. Not real racy, good family entertainment. It's definitely a ""B"" movie.",1490745600,2,357,4.682539682539683
165595,5,0800112652,I had seen this movie in theatres when it first came out and I thought it was so funny. I saw it several times. I was elated to find that it was on DVD visiting Amazon's site that I had to buy it. When it arrived I immediately watched it and the movie is just as funny as it was in the theatres. You put Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed together and comedy ensues.,1490659200,,358,3.8513513513513513

I don't smoke dope, but that doesn't mean I don't laugh myself into stomach cramps when Dom gets some ""laughing grass"" and giggles until tears run down his cheeks. The whole premise, the plot twists, and the acting are so outrageous, one just has to go along for the insanity.  Hot Stuff should have become a huge cult classic.",1478390400,2,409,4.44

Hot Stuff takes me back to a time when movies weren't made of CGI but instead relied on people's talents to make it great rather than computer technology. When you saw a stunt you *knew* a real person was doing it and there was real risk involved.

I've always loved the actors in Hot Stuff but it saddens me deeply that ALL of them are now deceased. Jerry Reed, Dom Deloise, Suzanne Pleshette and Luis Avalos made Hot Stuff a movie the whole family can enjoy. Living in Miami I always loved watching movies that were shot in and around the city, and I've seen a LOT of television shows and movies being made in greater Miami over the decades. Another interesting fact about this movie is that numerous actors in Hot Stuff also either starred or appeared on Miami Vice, which aired from 1984-1990. Luke Halpin, who originally played Sandy in the 60's TV show ""Flipper"", also played a very small part in Hot Stuff and also played ""Detective Frankel"" in Miami Vice as well.

This is a wonderful movie with a lot of silly, fun humor by some truly great actors who aren't with us anymore. These were the days...",1370822400,,1244,4.404347826086957

Dom Delouise & Jerry Reed play cops going under cover to catch a bunch of thieves and burglars. All pretty much petty thieves with a twist.

It's a fun, silly comedy with action, bursting with great characters and lots of memorable moments.

The DVD quality is definitely the best I have ever seen this film.  Older prints came out murky.  This is as clear as you could ever hope for, and the sound is great.

165774,5,0800112652,"Over the years I would check Amazon every so often to see if ""Hot Stuff"" were finally available on DVD.  I knew it would be a long shot because unlike popular seventies films ""Jaws"" or ""The Godfather"", ""Hot Stuff"" is not a well known movie.  You ask anybody if they have seen it and you're more likely to get an answer such as ""What?"".  I was very pleased to see the movie is finally available.  I ordered a copy immediately.

Supposedly based on an actual sting operation run by the Miami Dade Police Department, ""Hot Suff"" stars the late Jerry Reed and the late Dom Deluise (Who worked together previously on ""Smokey and the Bandit 2"". Deluise also serves as director here.) as two Miami police detectives facing reassignment if their department does not start getting convictions.  After busting a shady pawn shop for accepting stolen property, Reed suggests taking over the shop and posing as gangsters running a fencing operation.  They set up shop along with Luis Avalos and the late Suzanne Plechette.  It's all downhill from there.

The movie is perfectly cast.  The main cast members are all excellent.  The late Ossie Davis is fantastic as the police captain overseeing the operation.  There are hysterical scenes through out the movie.  The two best in my opinion are a cameo by the late Pat McCormick as a man selling Cuban cigars and Deluise sampling some marijuana being offered by two British drug dealers.  I can mention scene after scene here that will have you laughing your head off, but I would not want to spoil the movie for you.  The climactic scene at the party where the crooks are busted is just plain fun.

It's too bad ""Hot Stuff"" did not get much attention upon its initial release.  Now with the movie finally available on DVD maybe it will get a little attention.  I recommend you give it some attention as soon as you can.",1342396800,7,1854,4.634969325153374

younger, I'm so glad I could get it on DVD.",1296950400,,201,3.8095238095238093
165829,5,0800112652,"I remember seeing this movie in the Summer of '79 at the Sameric Theatre(formerly the Boyd) on a double-bill with ""North Dallas Forty"".  That tidbit aside, Dom DeLuise made some interesting choices in and around that time.  In 1978 he did a memorable turn as a schizophrenic in ""The End"", a dark comedy about death and dying starring and directed by Burt Reynolds.  In 1980 he was the star of ""Fatso"", a film about the travails of an obese young man which was directed by Anne Bancroft.  No less an expert than Martin Scorsese characterized that film as one the best depictions of an Italian-American family ever made.  Currently that film is unavailable on DVD and I would recommend strongly that some company take the impetus to reissue it.  This is an interesting piece for DeLuise to helm in his directorial debut.  Ostensibly a cop caper film DeLuise demonstrates an assuredness behind the camera.  He artfully captures Miami in all it's sunsplashed seediness that predates ""Miami Vice"" by five years.  The script is at turns whimsical, witty, and gritty which should come as no surprise because it was co-scripted by Donald Westlake who expertly adapted Jim Thompson's ""The Grifters"" a decade later. A bit by Marc Lawrence(""The Asphalt Jungle"") as a mobster gives the film further gravitas.  I remember when this film was released in the waning days of Summer with little fanfare.  The studio probably didn't know whether to promote it as a raucous comedy or a gritty cop flick.  It's unfortunate it's been released on DVD by mail order only.  Word of mouth about this unheralded gem might entice a distributor to make it more readily available.",1295136000,2,1651,4.874551971326165
165830,5,0800112652,Good family movie for children and adults alike - cops (undercover)fencing in a pawn shop trying to catch bad guys but lots of mishaps through out the movie... A must see if you like movies like cannonball run... Dom Deluise at his funniest!  Too Cute.,1241913600,,252,4.6
165831,4,0800112652,"Sure wish this was out on DVD, with any and all available extra footage. With Dom and Jerry gone, it sure is way overdue.",1241481600,,121,4.083333333333333
165832,3,0800112652,"It's funny how it was decades since viewing this movie again but I always remembered and liked best was Dom DeLuise experimenting and lighting up a joint, and then laughing hysterically. That laugh put me in tears.  Twenty years after I first saw this film (at the theater), I still chuckle at Dom's laugh.

He's still fun to watch as are his partners in crime in this story: Suzanne Pleshette, Jerry Reed and Ossie Davis. Actually, DeLuise, Reed and Pleshette play undercover cops in a sting operation, if you can believe that!  The only negative for me was hearing nice-guy Dom use the Lord's name in vain so much in this film, at least early on,

If you enjoy seeing oddball characters, you'll like this comedy crime caper. It certainly has it's share of wackos.",1235260800,3,765,4.644444444444445
165833,5,0800112652,"This is a movie I grew up watching.  Not many others have seen it, except for die hard Jerry Reid fans! (I am not, I just love the movie).  Dom DeLuise directed and Jerry Reid sings the theme song, and you see plenty of cops wearing leisure suits and bell bottoms. What more could you ask for?
I bought this for my mom since it is not available on DVD since the version on our beta machine no longer works! Hail to the '80s movies!",1200960000,,431,4.0588235294117645
165834,4,0800112652,"I wish this would come out on dvd not that it is such a great movie but the scene where dom buys & samples ""pot"" is worth the price of watching the rest.
He accidently gets high & begins laughing & the rest of the cast probably enjoyed the scene as much as the audience.",1188172800,,270,3.9272727272727272
