8092466,5,B000BTJD6M,"We bought this for our almost [...] son and he loves both of them. They are older videos and skits from the early days of the Wiggles, but still just as good. The skits on Wiggle Playtime are silly, but cute. Yummy Yummy is mostly videos, and even though others have complained in the reviews for this dvd about the puppet parts, my son loves them. I will mention that we bought them for a few dollars less at Walmart, but this is still a good price for two dvds....

But then again, the Wiggles can do no wrong in the eyes of my little one!! He loves everything they do and these dvds are a life safer for when I need to get things done around the house.",1154390400,,655,4.077519379844961
