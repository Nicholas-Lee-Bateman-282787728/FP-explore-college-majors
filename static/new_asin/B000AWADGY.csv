We follow triplets whose parents died in a car wreck. One is blinded, one is okay, the other floats down the river to be rescued by a woman coming home from her mother's funeral.

That woman raises the girl and never tells her of the family's search for the missing triplet.

When they grow up, the blind one is sweet, like Melanie in GWTW; one is glamorous and hopelessly in (incestuous) love with her uncle; while the third is raised poor but honest in a village. (She sings.)

The actress who plays all three roles, Lucero, does a great job of differentiating the three characters and the romantic lead is played by Luis Jose Santander, who looks like a burly Ryan O'Neal. The actor who plays the uncle, Otto Sirgo, is wonderful and I just saw Sortilegio where he plays a villain. I loved the scene where he really put the screws to a feminist. He paid her bill at a restaurant (she was at another table); he only regretted that he couldn't see her face when she finds out that a man paid for her meal.

The best thing about this is the editing for the climactic scene in the basement when one triplet traps the other two and intends to kill them so she can have her uncle to herself. The actress is terrific and the editing is to die for! I got my set from Amazon.",1407542400,,1298,4.299180327868853

8079980,5,B000AWADGY,"This is one of the best Telenovelas of all time. This DVD, like the others in this series, is an edited version, but shows from beginning to end the whole story. It does leave out alot of details but you still get 4 1/2 hours of footage. I recommend this to anybody who has seen or never seen the novela. I was very happy just to experience the novela again.",1129507200,7,358,4.128571428571429
