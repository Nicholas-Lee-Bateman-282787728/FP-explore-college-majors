This DVD has four sections, each about 15 minutes long.  The sections:

AB SECTION 1
**Standing core work while using light weights and then it's on to the floor for crunches.  Some folks think they bulk up if they do ab work with light weights.  If this is the case, simply do the exercises with no weights; you'll still feel them!

AB SECTION 2
**Different plank variations - ouch!  You also use a stability ball for some fun variations, e.g. ball transfer and side twist.

STRETCH SECTION 1
**Standing stretches using a band.  You'll also work on your balance with some of the stretches.

STRETCH SECTION 2
**Stretches while lying down.  The band is used to help extend the stretch.  Amy gives special focus to your breathing in this section, which really helps you relax your muscles and go further into the stretch.

What I especially liked about this DVD:

**Amy encourages lots of breaks between ab exercises.  This really helps you to attack that next set with more energy.

**Amy is so relaxed and joyous.  She is having a blast and her enthusiasm is catching.  It's as though you're in a live class with her.  I was particularly impressed with Amy in this DVD since this was one of her first DVD workouts.

**Amy is doing the exercises right along with you.  She is encouraging you the whole time, which is especially welcome near the end of a set when you're running out of steam.

**the 15 minute time frame for each section is just right.  The timing makes it so easy to tack on these routines to another workout.

**the clean, airy feel of the set.  The set looks to be a living room, with wood floors and bare walls.

I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who dreads core work and who never takes time to stretch.  Amy and these routines may just get you hooked!",1278460800,4,2045,4.478260869565218
