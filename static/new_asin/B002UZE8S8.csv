3993726,5,B002UZE8S8,This is one of the most compelling stories about connecting persons with dementia to life again. I highly recommend it to anyone who has a friend or family member with any form of dementia. It will inspire you to see the light in a perceived dark world and it will spark ideas on connecting persons with dementia to ways that open their minds and their lives again. It is a fabulous story that begins with a caregiver's observation and progresses to the caregiver and daughter connecting the dots that ultimately opens her mother's mind to living again. It is also the story of a deep commitment to enhancing a person's life with dementia.,1380067200,2,639,4.663716814159292
3993727,4,B002UZE8S8,"Interesting, thoughtful, and a useful teaching aid in terms of showing ways to access and express personhood in dementia. Nice touch to have the 96 year-old Olivia de Havilland narrate.

Perhaps slightly over-dichotomizes the medical/residential approach versus the creative approach, and the residential homes seem very well-staffed and appointed in international terms - a state of affairs that we should all be advocating for!

A very minor reservation is the slightly off-beam focus on the amygdala in terms of preserved emotions - we are much more than our amygdala!  The Procrustean urge to narrow neurological localization is a relic of Victorian neurology and needs reining in...

Overall recommended for lay, caring and professional viewing.",1366156800,,750,5.552631578947368

3993730,5,B002UZE8S8,"When I think of my mother as her Alzheimer's Disease progressed, I think of her eyes.  They became more and more cloudy and distant as her disease progressed.  It upset me so much that I never could know what was behind them, or bring them back to life.

I thought of my mother as I watched this film.  I was so moved when I saw the eyes of these patients begin to sparkle again as they worked with their brushes and paint.  How incredibly wonderful!
What is also so great about this film is that it provides expert commentary and explanation from some of the nation's leading scientific and medical experts on Alzheimer's Disease. The film is emotionally rich and leaves one hopeful.  I loved it.",1273190400,9,697,4.492063492063492
3993731,5,B002UZE8S8,"This film had a great impact on me. Watching a good friend of my family suffer through this horrible disease, I wish I had known about these new methods sooner. Watching people with Alheimer's suffer and stuggling to connect with them myself is so defeating. When I watched this film, I felt hope. It's amazing how art and these new therapies really do help slow down Alzheimer's and help families and friends reconnect with people with the disease. By going to museums or participating in the arts, people diagnosed with Alzheimer's have a chance to impede the progress of this disease and remain active and vibrant. It's amazing to me, when I watch this film, to know that these people have Alzheimer's. I don't recognize the disease in them. It is such a stark contrast from my visits to the care residences I have come to know. While taking into account the different stages of the disease, it is still hard for me to compare the Alzheimer's patients I have seen in person to those in the movie.

More medication is not the answer. I can attest to the healing power of art in my own life, whatever form it may take, but to see it pervading all walks and conditions just reiterates how important creativity is to the human condition itself. The film does not only focus on painting, music, and drawing, but also describes the importance of exercise for all who are at risk of developing Alzheimer's, not just for those in their later years. There is talk about how important exercise is for you and me. I know I hear it all the time, but this time there is proof that exercise also protects us against Alzheimer's, which is one I haven't heard.

If you know someone with Alzheimer's or are in some way affected by the disease, watch this film. It's never too late to make someone's life a little better. There are ways to reconnect with those with Alzheimer's and there are ways to slow down its symptoms. This film reminds us not to give up.",1257465600,22,1945,4.538461538461538
3993742,5,B002UZE8S8,"This film is exceptional! It erases all arguments why you think you shouldn't make an effort to engage people with dementia. As a professional in the field, this film making team did a super job of capturing what so many of us have seen firsthand. You will not be disappointed, but instead will be thrilled and inspired for sure! Enjoy!",1428969600,,336,4.616666666666666

3993747,5,B002UZE8S8,I heard about this film when doing research on Alzheimers. I volunteer as a care group facilitator and lost my Mom to the disease recently. I am a huge advocate for finding activities for seniors who are in nursing homes. There is never enough money or staff it seems. Art Therapy is an amazing gift to people and this DVD shows how effective it can be. It is a must see for Rec Therapists and staff at facilities.,1408665600,2,414,4.32051282051282

3993750,5,B002UZE8S8,"I selfishly don't want to review this product, since I never want there to be a shortage!  These we're recommended by a respected nutritionist and they are amazing. It's like eating a mounds bar but filling and with unbelievably low sugar content.  How these things taste like they do without sugar and with low calories is beyond me. Expensive but totally worth it.",1394150400,,366,4.7936507936507935

As with most books and media about dementia, Alzheimer's, etc., such a multi-faceted disease makes it difficult to be completely comprehensive. Still, I recommend it as a companion with other means of learning more.",1471305600,,293,5.25531914893617
