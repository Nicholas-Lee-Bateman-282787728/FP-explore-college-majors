2163254,3,B00062L8W6,"Good addition to other workouts such as Yoga, Pilates and weight training. Starting point for a beginner (in this genre, me.)  Basic - but not easy - routine builds endurance and strength using your own body weight. The separate instruction on exercise form is very good. The ITB (illiotibial band) stretch during the warmup... isn't.  See this url for a good ITB stretch. [...]  The absence of a brief stretch at the end of the workout is a gap.  After the workout, consider stretching psoas, ITB, quadriceps, calves and chest - even if you are playing ""Pretend"".",1132444800,2,564,4.783505154639175

2163256,5,B00062L8W6,"We purchased this DVD for our son before he entered the Navy.  He thought he was in great shape and ready for bootcamp.  He had been running several days a week and had built up to about 6 miles.  After exercising with this workout system, he found a few ""weak"" areas!  Long distance running was not enough to get his body ready!  This simple workout routine was great for strengthening his upper body and abdominal areas.  After a few weeks, the full body push-up ""pyramid"" routine and ab crunches helped to build him up to an advanced level.  We liked this workout system because it required no extra equipment--just a couple of chairs and a wall.  It was a simple, no-frills video that everyone should try.  Hum-m-m-m, maybe after my son leaves for bootcamp, I might try a few reps!",1125273600,4,785,4.55

2163258,5,B00062L8W6,"I recently wrote a review for this product to try and help correct a misunderstanding that another reviewer had wrote but after having and using the product for a few more weeks have decided that the quality of the product deserves a more in-depth review (hence the edit of my previous one). It's a little longer than the original but for those considering parting with our hard earned cash the more information available to you on a product has always been better (for me at least).

This DVD is the start of a four part series with this DVD being System 1 - Preparatory which will follow on to System 2 - Master Level Fitness, System 3 - Plateau Breakers and System 4 - Out Blast. You must understand this before you purchase it as although it is a complete and challenging workout for all levels it is also the start or foundation workout for the more advanced DVD's that will follow.

The DVD is very well produced and presented, is shot in what I would consider an exotic location and is easy to navigate having the option of the workout and a focus on technique (plus scene selections) available from the menu. The workout portion runs to nearly 55 minutes plus you get the focus on technique section to ensure you do the movement the right way.

The workout consists of a warm-up with jumping jacks and high knees, you then have about 5 different stretches and then move on to dips, push ups, lunges, mountain climbers, calf raises, the wall, hand to toes, crunches and reverse crunches. Within just about each area there are different levels for the beginner, intermediate and advanced user. Essentially this provides a complete full body workout and if done while following the DVD I would be surprised if no matter your level of fitness if you don't feel it. You also need do not need any equipment, just some motivation, a place to workout and a couple of chairs or something suitable to do dips on.

The other section is the focus on technique section in which the author illustrates each of the movements that will be used within the workout. For me at least initially this was the reason that I originally purchased the DVD as I do not wish to go to a gym to ensure that I have the correct technique and this was the only DVD I could find that I trusted enough to show it to me. The workout came as a bonus and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was considering I did initially look at it for the workout.

While you may be thinking that this DVD is not a complete workout, it is and the author has done the admirable thing by separating his workout series into a number of different DVD's. For one thing you get much more information than would be available if he tried to put everything on one DVD and more importantly he has tried to eliminate the problem of injuries which many people would face if they fail to create a solid foundation of fitness.

Remarkably this DVD is able to create a solid foundation of fitness for beginners and have something useful for the more advanced individuals, through the author's use of different reps within the workout. Few individuals who consider themselves fit would be able to say they have not had a workout if they follow this exercise routine and most beginners should be able to easily cope with the workout and see positive results before the next level DVD is available.

Over recent years more and more prominent fitness gurus and authors have begun to advocate the use of body weight exercises, probably due to there effectiveness, the reduction of the risk of injury and the total body workout that can be had at least from the methods that this author advocates. The thing that has always turned me off many of these authors is the cult following which some of them have and the complete lack of objectivity that some of their reviewers have, I generally do not take the time to do reviews unless I feel a product is truly worthy or if is good and has no reviews or there is misleading information on the product but with this DVD I feel that it is worthy of your hard earned money.

I would have to say that I believe this DVD is worth the money and that the workout is challenging, comprehensive and above all safe and that although there are not a lot of other options available in this genre even if there was I don't think you would find a better product unless there was a massive change in the way these types of products are made.

Finally I would also say that you should evaluate the track record and credibility of any author that produces any workout video or book. Although I have purchased this authors books before I find him credible and trust him as professional in his field for the following reasons. He has a number of books which have always received high praise on Amazon, he has not just dreamed up some new thing and tried to sell it, he has also always advocated these types of exercises and at least in my opinion has managed to incorporated them into a better overall package and refined how he delivers them but most importantly for me is the fact that he always comes across as a passionate man for the subject area and gives you the feeling that he does not only care about selling his product but also cares about the individual that will be using it something that is lacking in many of the other authors that currently produce fitness books and videos.",1123459200,71,5361,4.473415132924336
2163259,2,B00062L8W6,"""Aerobics and push-ups"" would be a more apropriate title for this DVD. It could be a nice starter for somebody who never worked out or is completely out of shape, but otherwise I strongly advise that people skip this one. This is a definite case of false advertising. On the cover Mark Delisle is wearing a weighted vest and looks like he's got some muscle, the cover reads that this is will be good for anyone. You'd think that there's some inovative and unique material here...nope. In reality Mark is very scrawny and so are the other two people performing the workouts. They don't have great physiques, they're just not fat, big deal. The whole workout is a few stretches, aerobics, pushup pyramids and crunches(not even sit-ups!), nothing new. Anyone who's been working out a few years can come up with an equivalent program. Damn, it doesn't even have pull-ups in it, how can it be called ""Special Ops"" or ""System 1""? A name like that deserves a program truly suited for spec-ops teams who I'm sure learn more than to stretch and do push-ups. If this is how Special Forces and Navy Seals work out then we're in deep trouble.",1123286400,7,1130,4.626865671641791
2163260,5,B00062L8W6,"I tell ya I never really had a good work out for awhile, when I 1st tried it my Body was in soo much of a burn I didn't think I could make it on the 3rd day! but I did and I'm feeling alot stronger and motivated to get system 2!

You want a workout geared for time and getting the most out of? by all means get this dvd!

Mark really knows what he's doing! He teaches you how to do it right the 1st time so when you take on the routine you build up to flexibility, strength, and endurance.

plus it helps if you have a hot tub to sooth your muscles too! :)

I've stopped drinking and smoking in order to get in shape using this program and reading his book, I'm no expert, but if I have to quit drinking and smoking in order to get in shape and have this workout routine to keep me going! you do the math!",1111536000,3,805,3.802395209580838
2163261,4,B00062L8W6,"I like this DVD, and use it several times a week. This is one of the workouts where there is a beginner, intermediate, and advanced version, three people one doing each version. The advanced is somewhat challenging starting with 1 min worth of jumping jacks, and high knee's. Then several minutes of stretching. The workout then begins with dips 40x3 with a short break in between, the short break for endurance makes it difficult. Then pushups using the pyrimyd system, 12-14- to 20, and back. Again with a short break in between sets.

Next is lower body with 40 2 count lunges, mountian climbers, and 300 calf raises. The most challenging one comes next ''The wall'' squating with your back against a wall for 5 min. As the the instructor says, this is a mental challenge, because of the pain after several min, and the boaring nature of it. But again it is challenging. Then finally Abs. This is a killer ab routine consisting of hand to toes 60x3, crunches 60x3, and reverse crunches 30x3. Again with a short rest period between the sets. I just described the advanced version,the other two are itentical with lower reps so you can build up to advanced. Over all a like it, and have seen results. Hope this helps.",1107475200,36,1218,4.638888888888889
2163262,5,B00062L8W6,"I bought this hoping it would be a good DVD workout and I can tell you it was!  I love this DVD and use it quite often.  This really is a full body workout and I wish he would come out with the next system.  If you do get this DVD and really use it, you will get in shape.  It is easy to follow and he explains everything extremely well.

Another nice thing about this video is that you do not need any weights of any kind which means if you are on the road traveling, when you get to your hotel at night pop this into your laptops dvd player and go at it.  You ca do this workout just about anywhere.  I highly recommend it.

An excellent one to add to the collection!",1190073600,,669,3.8676470588235294
2163263,3,B00062L8W6,"I had purchased this video because nothing else seemed stimulating.....and being prior military, I figured it would be what I was accustomed to.  I have found myself bored with it after 2 weeks. I took things from it that I wanted, and turn on my own music to work out.

It DOES cause a good burn, and make you work....good to start out with, and get into a routine with.  It did not, however, keep my attention.",1183766400,2,412,4.324675324675325
2163264,4,B00062L8W6,"This video delivers everything it promises. The workout is very challenging and will leave you sore if you're a beginner like me. The video itself could use better organization. The video does the beginner, intermediate, and advanced workouts all together. e.g. Jumping jacks Beginner do 30, Intermediate do 40, Advanced do 50. The exercise begins with all three instructors doing the exercise. Then the beginner stops, then the intermediate stops, then when the advanced finished they do a 30 second break between sets. This gives beginners a long break between sets (by design?) and drags the workout out a lot longer than it should be. I would still recommend the video for your strength training days. It is not something you could do every day without getting bored but good for mixing things up.",1178409600,2,801,4.985074626865671
2163265,4,B00062L8W6,"Great workout!  This gets the job done. I'm a personal trainer and I wasn't sure if this would give me an intense workout, but it does--and then some. My only gripe is the placement of the stretching segment--it would be better placed at the end of the session. If you're looking for a good, no-frills, a**-kicking workout that focuses on strength and cardio this is it.",1176163200,2,370,4.606060606060606
2163266,5,B00062L8W6,"I am a triathlete and have gone through many DVDs of this type. None approaches the intensity nor the effectiveness of this one. It is fast and furious, with 30 sec break in between, and for me,will be  a keeper. I have gotten much stronger, run , bike and swim faster because of this DVD. Highly recommended, truly a cut above the rest.

2163267,2,B00062L8W6,Great dvd. I tried it for about a three weeks really didn't do much for me since I do the Bas Rutten MMA Workout on CD and through in Matt Furey's Combat Conditioning.  Those programs are so challenging.  I would recommened it to someone that is trying to get back in shape since it great for overall conditioning if you have had a long layoff from workingout.,1168473600,3,360,4.358208955223881

2163269,3,B00062L8W6,"I like Mark De Lisle's fitness products, especially Breakthrough to Master Level Fitness.  This DVD is a good addition to that book and is quite effective as far as it does, especially for a beginner's workout.

However, its supposed to be a build-up for more advanced Systems 2 and 3 etc.  I brought the DVD over six months ago and nothing else in the series has come out - I think people will soon get bored with this DVD and will give up waiting for others in the series to come out.",1151020800,2,486,4.260869565217392
2163270,3,B00062L8W6,"I have my share of Bodyweight programs, such as combat Conditioning, Body by Fish, The Miracle seven, pushing yourself to power and a few others. I have no connection to any of them, I have paid my hard earned money, just like you and I have nothing to gain, nor do I have an axe to grain, and no I am not selling any product of my own. Having said that:

Mark's DVD is good, it is a nice workout. As already mentioned by another reviewer:  ""This DVD is the start of a four part series with this DVD being System 1 . . . ou must understand this before you purchase it as although it is a complete and challenging workout for all levels it is also the start or foundation workout for the more advanced DVD's that will follow.""

The DVD will give you a nice workout, but it does fall short in a few areas:

1. The rest periods are too long between beginner and advanced. If you are doing the beginner's workout, you will stop and rest while the other two people finish their workout and then get the normal 30 second rest,way to long if you ask me.

2. On one set, they forget to tell the Beginners to stop (calf raises portion, if my memory is correct)

3. On the Wall Portion, the beginners are suppose to do 1 minute, he ups this time on the tape to 115 or 130, geesh.

4. Watching Mark look at his watch is pretty lame, should have used an off camera clock.

5. looks as if Mark's tape is a poor copy of Stephen ""Scott"" Helvenston series of workouts (Scott was a former SEAL recently killed in the Middle East).

Marks is a nice workout, but falls a bit short. Buy Stephen ""Scott"" Helvenston, it is a better buy and workout for your money.",1139184000,,1641,4.151419558359621
2163271,4,B00062L8W6,"I bought this dvd about a month ago I go to the gym 3 days a week and off my off days from the gym I used the semper fit routine.  I bought it this dvd on mark delisle (sp.) name and reputation as putting out good products.  This is a great dvd but after a few weeks of it I found myself going back to the semper fit routine.  There are some good exercises on this that I had neglected doing the marine corp workout like the calf raises, mountain climbers, wall sit.  And the exercises are also set into a logical progression depending on the level used about a minute of aerobics i.e. jumping jacks, and high knee raises followed by stretching, then to triceps, chest, legs, abs with a beginner, intermediate, and advanced workout routine.  Overall very good but there are better products this dvd did give me some new exercises that I have incorporated into the semper fit workout.  It also should be noted that the workout can be done with no exercise equipment which is why I am not reviewing it down for no pull ups or back work.",1132876800,6,1034,4.304123711340206

8037632,1,B00062L8W6,I do not know how other people rated this dvd so well. It showed a very basic workout routine that you do three days a week. It was very elementary and it was made for couch potatoes who never workout. Just because you're a Navy SEAL doesn't mean you should be making fitness videos. Do not waste your money on this! If I could get my money back I would. There are plenty of reputable DVD's and books on fitness out there that teach you a lot more.,1292630400,,448,4.1022727272727275

It is very hard to get my husband to work out inside, but he loves this one.  After doing it 5-6 times, he was able to write the exercises down and do them in his hotel room while traveling.  That is a definite plus since he travels a lot for his job.  Another reason it is great for us is the varied levels within the workout.  My husband is stronger than I am and more fit.  So, when I can't do anymore, he just keeps going to the higher levels on the video while I stretch.  It's great!",1257292800,,593,3.9661016949152543

I did not like it for myself, I prefer to be able to do pull ups and work out slower, with no breaks between exercises in order to get the heart rate going (improves recovery and stroke volume), then follow it by intervals (sprints, bycicle sprints or jump rope intervals).",1229990400,,387,4.464788732394366
8037637,4,B00062L8W6,"This workourt is a good basic workout for people who haven't been exercising regularly. A bit about me: I have been a cyclist for years but found myself lacking core strength and upper body strength. I picked up on the Navy Seals a few years ago, and figured if they get in shape doing basic calesthenics, then it is good enough for me also. I also have Mark's book on Navy Seal Workout book, along with Stew Smith's books.

This DVD is good because it has beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. The only thing this DVD lacks is pullups, and it is for that it loses one star. I am looking forward to System 2 ( Mark, I hope you are reading.) One of the things I like is you can skip to the next scene to bypass workouts that are too easy or advanced for you.

Overall, good solid workout is obtained and I feel the workout for days afterwords. I will keep using this DVD for a long time. I would highly recommend this anyone, man or woman, boy or girl. You have good control over the workout you get from the DVD.",1215993600,,1018,4.2153846153846155
8037638,5,B00062L8W6,"I am a fairly fit female and I am living in a remote area of Europe for a year--no gyms, living out of a suitcase and a lap-top bag, and so my workouts are pretty much limited to things that require minimal equipment.  This DVD is a fabulous find for that.  Sure, all of these exercises are ones I've done before (lunges, tricep dips, mountain climbers, push-ups, sit-ups, wall-squats), but if they weren't all put together on the DVD with someone TELLING me what to do and saying motivating things, I wouldn't do the strength training half as often.
There is a short aerobic warmup and some stretching--I usually do this after a walk or light jog, otherwise the warmup would be a bit short for my tastes.  Then they move right into strength moves.  The program has excellent descriptions of the moves separate from the exercise portion of the DVD, so watch that before your first use and maybe refresh yourself once or twice to make the moves most effective.  The first exercises are chest, back, shoulders focused, with legs and abs later on.  The set-up is great: there are three levels, with more repetitions at each level.  If you don't fast forward, the lower levels thus have more rest time as well.  Being a female, I use the extra rest time on the upper body things (although the woman who demonstrates the intermediate level never looks too tired,so that is good motivation...) but not the extra rest time on the lower body and abs.  So you can tailor your workout a bit--you advance to the next level for each exercise individually, so if you are 'unevenly' strong like me, you aren't stuck at one level for all.
There is something very motivating but at the same time reasonable about the instructor's voice and personality.  He is positive without being perky or annoying, and he really does seem to want you to succeed.  His talking gets a little old the more times you view it, but surprisingly I still find that certain things he says motivate me to try a few more reps.
This is a very solid workout, with good safe instructions and a motivating instructor and demonstrators.  It can be done with a minimum of equipment--you need a wall, and somewhere to do chest dips (chairs, solid bedframe, rock).  Other than that, you are good to go.  Other than the sorta short warmup, I have nothing but praise for this system.  I have done a lot of workout DVDs, classes, and I have done team and individual sports in high school, college, and beyond, and I feel like this is challenging but not unreasonable for anyone to do.  True beginners or those who have let their fitness slide for quite a while might find themselves struggling even to do the beginner level at first, but stick with it and don't worry if you can't do all the reps at first--these are basic, proven exercises and you WILL increase your strength and stamina if you keep at it.",1214352000,,2856,4.570588235294117

I am 54 years old, already in fairly good shape and am at the beginner level for many of the exercises and interim for the rest. Once, I reach the advanced levels, I should be in outstanding shape! If you are looking for an exercise video without silly music or people in fancy outfits (although the folks in this one do wear fatigues,)the need for extra eqpt, and are only interested in getting into good shape (or maintaining), I highly recommend this video. After a short time, I will have the routines memorized and have a workout for the rest of my life.
