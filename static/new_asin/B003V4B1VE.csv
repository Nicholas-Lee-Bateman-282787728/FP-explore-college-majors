8589383,5,B003V4B1VE,"Sean Penn represents a way of thinking and doing that Americans would be wise to both listen to and emulate. He is the epitome of what might still allow the USA to earn a measure of genuine respect -- plus a lot less enemies -- in the rest of the world. For generations now the message 'preached' to those who live overseas has been nothing but one of purest arrogance, a 'wouldn't you all love to live exactly the same as we do' attitude, one that does far more than imply superiority. All but the most recent immigrants, myself among them, have lost all connection with ancestors who were  poor, but were battlers, who were often humble, but genuinely proud of who they were and what they brought with them. This has very nearly vanished.
  However, Sean Penn -- by what he believes in and what he does -- offers a means by which honesty as well as respect may become what America is seen to stand for in the eyes and hearts of others. He is no paranoid braggart, he is the opposite of this -- in fact the way Charlie Rose so obviously respects him bears this out.
  Today's interview offers hope for a future where global partnership and co-operation do away with the need for conflict, where armies can be used to build and not destroy. Mr. Penn is too up front to be attracted to politics -- what a pity!",1279584000,2,1309,4.348360655737705
