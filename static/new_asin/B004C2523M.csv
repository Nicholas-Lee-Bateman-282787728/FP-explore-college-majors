4324244,5,B004C2523M,"THE PROWLER (1951) was one of the long unseen Holy Grail's of film noir until the Film Noir Foundation and the UCLA Film and Television Archive restored it a few years ago in a joint effort.

At first glance, THE PROWLER might appear to be another knock-off of classic noirs in which an adulterous couple murders the lady's husband.  But, this one is somewhat different.

Evelyn Keyes plays a lonely housewife who calls the police when she sees a prowler peeking in her window.  One of the cops who takes the call is unscrupulous Van Helfin, and he, almost immediately, decides that he want s this woman...particularly when he discovers that her husband is quite wealthy.

Unlike similar themed films like DOUBLE INDEMNITY, it is the man, not the woman, in this story who is the evil one.  While she cheats on her husband, Keyes is also a victim of the predatory Heflin, and although he is definitely the villain of the piece, he is certainly not your typical black-and-white heavy.  Indeed, his is a well-rounded character who if, at times, he doesn't evoke our sympathy, does induce our understanding.

The performances are exquisite.  Heflin, one of the finest actors of his day, is at the top of his game, and Ms. Keyes proves that she is capable of playing a much more complex character than Scarlett O'Hara's youngest sister or Al Jolson's wife.

The screenplay by blacklisted Dalton Trumbo (using a ""front"") is first-rate, as is the direction by also blacklisted Joseph Losey.

Among the extras on the DVD from VCI Entertainment is an excellent documentary featurette about the ""making of"" the movie, which includes interviews with James Ellroy, Alan K. Rode and Trumbo's son, Christopher.

Although the main actress can seem a little over the top at points, it is classic noir at its finest.  I would highly recommend it to all lovers of this genre.  So grab your favorite snack, dim the lights, and sit back and enjoy ""The Powler""!",1300665600,5,398,4.397260273972603
4324246,5,B004C2523M,"I received the DVD of The Prowler from Amazon yesterday and watched it immediately.  I was blown away.  This ranks in the very top tier of noirs along with Double Indemnity, Out of the Past, The Narrow Margin, and a very few others.  Heflin shows again he is THE most under appreciated actor of the golden age.....his performance as a sociopathic cop is subtle and chilling.

Many thanks to the Film Noir Foundation and UCLA for recovering and restroring this lost orphan.  The movie looks great, the sound is clear, and the special features are informative and interesting.  The commentary by Eddie Mueller is the highlight as it is every time he does one of these.

Not to be missed.............highest praise possible.",1297468800,38,721,4.860655737704918

The story goes something like this, when officer Webb Garwood (Van Heflin) investigates a wee-hours peeping-Tom call with his veteran partner Bud (John Maxwell), he finds himself drawn to the victim - attractive and vulnerable housewife Susan Gilvray (Evelyn Keyes) --- Dutiful and quietly desperate, Mrs. Gilvray spends evenings listening to her DJ husband John's late-night radio show - which he ends every night by cooing ""I'll be seeing you Susan..."" ---

Tense and taunt dialogue with one of his best performances by somestimes overlooked veteran actor Van Heflin.

4324248,5,B004C2523M,"I saw this at a Film Noir Foundation screening at the Music Box in Chicago about two years ago, and was absolutely blown away.  If you like film noir, you don't want to miss this one.  Kudos to the Film Noir Foundation for their efforts in preserving this masterpiece.",1293840000,7,268,4.448979591836735
4324249,5,B004C2523M,"THE PROWLER is one of the best film noir you've probably never seen.
I first discovered it more than 25 years ago on late night tv in the UK (those were the days when the BBC still screened old movies) and it hooked me right away. The story of illicit passion and murder exuded an incredibly compelling sense of suffocating claustrophobia and barely suppressed tension, and that memory's stuck with me for the ensuing quarter century.
So when I was finally able to get my hands on a VHS copy my concern was that the reality wouldn't live up to the memory, and I'd be left wondering what on earth is was I ever saw in the film.
I watched THE PROWLER again last night all my worries were put to rest. This 1951 film is a five star classic.
Van Heflin stars as Webb Garwood, a police patrolman in an upscale neighborhood in Los Angeles. One night he and his dull as ditchwater partner, Bud Crocker, are called to investigate a prowler at one of the big houses on their beat. They find an attractive young woman, Susan Gilvray, home alone and Webb takes an instant liking to her. Even though she's married and initially resists his advances, Webb determines to seduce her and use her to get what he wants out of life.
Heflin's masterful performance is a major factor in this film's effectiveness. As an actor he often played characters who exuded a certain vulnerability borne of physical or moral weakness, but here he turns it into a strength. Garwood's moral compass has been so eroded by the acidic bitterness of failed dreams that he's no longer restrained by any sense of right and wrong. He targets Susan like a tiger stalking its prey. His cynical and unscrupulous manipulation of her undermines everything that his police uniform represents.
In the hands of Evelyn Keyes, Susan is a not entirely unwilling victim. Looking and acting like a bargain basement Lana Turner, she comes across as only slightly less untrustworthy than her seducer. Trapped in a loveless and controlling marriage to a much older man, she wants to believe that Webb is the solution to her unhappy existence, and at times it's difficult to determine just who is manipulating who.
On a larger scale THE PROWLER is an unsettling indictment of the corrupting influence of materialism on the American Dream. Webb bitterly resents his inability to get ahead yet he's unwilling to put in the honest toil required to bring even his modest ambition of running a motel within his grasp. Susan has more than Webb can ever aspire to yet she lives the life of a bird trapped in a gilded cage, paid for by her husband's syrupy, insincere shilling for the sponsors of his late-night radio show.
What is perhaps most depressing is the lack of viable alternatives offered up by the story. A man in Webb's situation, it says, has no choice but to act boldly and disregard accepted norms of behaviour if he's to avoid being crushed by conformity. The best that the American Dream can offer is the life of mind-numbing soul destroying tedium embodied by Webb's middle-aged partner Bud. The biggest kick in Bud's life is showing off his collection of rocks amassed during his annual vacation to the California desert.
Reportedly shot in just 17 days on a budget of $700,000 THE PROWLER offers up more food for thought than any of the bloated, special effects engorged thrillers which pass for cinematic entertainment these days.
I can't wait for 11 February 2011 and the release of THE PROWLER on DVD. To see the film in its restored version will only enhance its brilliance. Beg, borrow, buy or steal a copy of this film. It will stay with you for life.",1289865600,137,3612,4.663009404388715

The screenplay and Losey's direction combine to retain a crucial ambiguity in the character played by Van Heflin - is he motivated by love or by money? His ultimate demise is the fulfillment of a tragic irony and embodies Trumbo and Losey's view of the destructive effect of the capitalist system on the individual caught in its entrails. This movie is critical to any serious study of Losey's career and should be available on DVD.",1227398400,23,620,4.75

4324257,5,B004C2523M,"Well plotted, ""The Prowler"" stars Van Heflin and Evelyn Keyes, two of my all-time favorites.  Evelyn Keyes is married to an old fuddy duddy when she meets and has an affair with policeman Van Heflin.  When her husband gets murdered, she marries Heflin and tells him he's gonna be a daddy.  Fearing people will figure out she must have gotten pregnant by Heflin while she was still married, and Heflin was the cop that said he accidentally shot her husband, the couple go out to a lonely place in the desert to have the baby.  (I don't know why they just couldn't say the baby's father was Keyes' dead husband's.  He couldn't have children, but she could still insist, in those pre-DNA days.)  But they do things the hard way, which makes the movie even better, especially when things start to go south.

4324259,4,B004C2523M,"Very compelling! By the 1950s, noir films had started losing their gritty edge. The stories softened out, and the moral lessons became a little more blatant. The Prowler maintains its grit, while at the same time, ventures into strange territory for a noir film. It's dark and sinister like the classics, but it's got a thread of sexual tension that many noir films lacked. The themes are complex; exploring the dangers of breaking social norms while at the same time, analyzing the oppressive elements within those social norms. Slow in a few places, but overall, this is well worth adding to any noir collection.",1442361600,2,614,4.913461538461538

4324289,5,B004C2523M,"This is one of the least known of the truly fine noir films from the 40s and early 50s, in large part because it was from an obscure studio and its director, Joseph Losey, only hit the big-time when he moved to England in later years. (Few people even remember that Losey worked in the US.) The set-up is partially reminiscent of DOUBLE INDEMNITY, but with the genders reversed: this time its the man from outside the large house using his animal magnetism to corrupt a woman inside of it (and who schemes to kill her husband). But though its story is not as archetypal as that of the James M. Cain novel (and the famous film based on it), it's subtler in its own way. Van Heflin plays an entitled Los Angeles cop who answers a call about a prowler from a beautiful unhappy wife (Evelyn Keyes); within days he's wormed his way into her affections and has a plan in place to rid her of her husband. What makes the film different are the ambiguity of Keyes's feelings (she desires Heflin but cannot really bring herself to condone murder) and the existentialist long denouement that begins when Keyes's character becomes pregnant. The camera work is really spectacular, beginning with the prowler's-eye view of Keyes's window over the opening credits, and continuing through other equally startling shots (a reverse-angle of the first shot from over Keyes's shoulder of Heflin looking into the window from the yard; a large car pulling up from the desert from the sheer emptiness beyond it). Both Heflin and Keyes found here the best parts they ever had in their careers, and played them for all they could. Though a handsomer actor might have made more sense for Heflin's part, and there were better actresses in Hollywood than Keyes (the part almost screams out for Ida Lupino), the two of them acquit themselves very well. Heflin especially carries most of the emotive weight of the story: he's a great anti-hero, always kept on the outside of the better life that he thought had been promised to him when he was a high school star athlete.",1407283200,,2041,4.6722222222222225

4324306,4,B004C2523M,"""The Prowler"" is an interesting film that fell short of my expectations.  It seems to draw most of its inspiration from James M. Cain notably ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"".  Director Joseph Losey evokes a satisfactorily noirish mood and the script by Dalton Trumbo is provocative but it seemed to me that there was a deliberate attempt to push the envelope of the Production Code for the sake of pushing it.  There's certainly any number of interesting twists here but ironically they are undermined by an ending that the Production Code people would approve of.  The film's selling point would be the spellbinding performance of Van Heflin as Webb the disgruntled L.A. patrolman.  His name is ironic because he is a tangle of malfeasance, self loathing, self pity, and manipulation.  So effective is Heflin that he makes the psychotic Webb almost sympathetic.  Evelyn Keyes as Susan, the frustrated housewife that Webb preys on, is another story.  Keyes has the range of a Barbie doll and Heflin has to compensate for her shortcomings as an actress.  I've read some of the reviews giving unqualified praise to the film probably more by its reputation than anything else.  This is passable but not classic noir.",1379203200,2,1214,4.965346534653466

4324310,4,B004C2523M,"I wouldn't quite go along with some of the raves I've heard so far.  Keyes and Van Heflin are good, but some of the motivation does not ring true.  Would not the coroner have questioned why Heflin did not make inquiries at the front door before going out back and engaging in a shooting?  Wouldn't Heflin's partner have been suspicious of Keyes' testimony, at her not recognizing the two policemen from their earlier encounter?  And would Keyes for a moment have given Heflin the benefit of the doubt in terms of being innocent?  I doubt it.  But it is hard to tell at times exactly what their relationship truly is, or where she stands.  I think this is more a weakness of the script than simple ambivalence on the part of the characters.  There are moments when the shared high school background of Keyes and Heflin makes the relationship believable, but Heflin's character doesn't track on a consistent basis. The script tends to be ambivalent toward him.  Are we supposed to like or hate him?  He's kind of a mug throughout portions of the film and when in uniform, but then a more sympathetic character with higher aspirations at times when he's with Keyes.  Even though I can understand his motivation as seducer and manipulator, there are moments that don't ring true.  You never really get a sense of their relationship having any central core.  Plot spoiler: a better idea might have been to have him shoot and kill a REAL prowler toward the end, and be found guilty of murder when his prior affair with Keyes is revealed.  This would have made him a more sympathetic character. Indeed, it might have been more dramatically viable if the Keyes character had pursued the Heflin character right from the very start, rather than vice versa.  And the movie tends to run amok at the end.",1367280000,,1791,4.659235668789809

4324326,3,B004C2523M,"As the film opens, cops Van Heflin and his partner investigate a call concerning a prowler in upscale 50s suburbia. This reviewer does not recall ""Los Angeles"" being specifically mentioned, but that is the apparent setting.  The caller is Evelyn Keyes, a lonely housewife whose husband is an all night DJ.  Heflin and his partner find nothing amiss but VH promises to check back on Keyes in the future: The perfect setup for a noir plot.

There is a crawly, uncanny feeling here straight from the first frame. Heflin's unhappiness with how his life has developed is palpable. The former high school basketball star is a bitter, sad guy. Look for the frame in which he reads ""Muscle Power"" magazine.  Noirish fate deems that the pair will run off together.  What did the obviously intelligent Keyes see in this man? Why does she leave a comfortable, stable, if boring suburban marriage to run off with a creep?  How many similar women in the movies (and real life) make such a slip?

Commentary on the plot is ending here. That is because ""The Prowler"" features a major (!) as well as ingenious plot twist.  A good review should maintain an air of mystery.  Suffice it so say that this ""twist"" changes everything for Heflin and Keyes.  They wind up in the bleak California desert, far from comfy suburbia. Look for the contrast!

The strict rating call from this source is 3 stars, though ""The Prowler"" plausibly rates a 4th.  This reviewer was uncomfortable with the cumbersome finale, yet others may be pleased. On the positive side, Keyes and Heflin are excellent. The supporting cast is absolutely first rate. The cloying, confining, orderly 50s suburbia creates a perfect mood.

4324342,5,B004C2523M,"A married young woman calls the police when she notices someone looking in through her bathroom window.  One of the cops takes an unhealthy interest in her, eventually pressuring her into an affair.  It's an unsettling scenario, one you know can only end badly, but it's so well written and directed that you can't look away.

Upon arriving at the woman's home, the younger cop searches outside for traces of the voyeur, while she shows his partner where she'd been.  She's startled when the young cop's face appears in the window, immediately suggesting an analogy between the cop and the alleged prowler.  Unhappy as a cop, he's looking in on a life from which he feels excluded unjustly.  What he wants is not just this woman, but the lifestyle and privilege that, he imagines, are the natural prerequisites for possessing her.  His desire is not just lust, but social envy, and with their realization that they'd grown up near each other in Indiana, he comes to think that she should have been his, that it's just an accident of fate that she wasn't and another accident of fate might restore him to what he imagines as his rightful place.  The film, I think, doesn't entirely side against him in this - there is a kind of injustice that he rightly identifies, but that he gets wrong when he takes it personally and attempts to overcome by means of further injustices.  The film manages to create an ambivalent sympathy for him even as he is shown to be willing to go as far as necessary to create for himself a place in the world.

He comes to think of her, along with the prosperity that would enable him to give her the lifestyle that makes her attractive to him, as the American Dream he was promised but lost.  He'd been the all-American boy - a hotshot basketball player who went to college on a major scholarship he lost for refusing to be a ""team player"" - and is now stuck in a job he's not proud of.  She'd been the beauty queen, but became a failed actress and accepted a loveless but safe marriage as an alternative to the dreams she'd once had.  What struck me, though, and what I like a lot about this film is that the picture's not all bleak.  The marriage of his older and wiser partner serves as healthy alternative to the unsettling depictions of class difference, of the tragedy of aspirations and dreams gone bad.  They aren't wealthy or especially beautiful.  Yet their marriage, not perhaps as romantic as the dream that animates the others, is sustained by a degree of mutual respect and shared hobbies and an interest in American history (including the history of ghost towns that figure in an interesting turn in the plot, and that indicate the fruitless search for some kind of prosperity to be a longstanding part of the American myth, that has taken various shapes throughout its history).

The dialogue is rich, shot through with double meanings - in its elegant efficiency it reminded me of the writing in some of the comedy classics of the 1930s, especially those described by Stanley Cavell as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/comedies-of-remarriage/dp/067473906X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""comedies of remarriage""</a>.  The film shares themes with those films as well, insofar as the officer Webb Garwood doesn't so much seduce the married Susan, as try to convince her that they share a past, they grew up together, that he shares her loneliness and what they need is each other.  He goes as far as to invent a past when they might have or should have met at a dance, and by implication they could have or even should have been sweethearts.  They later try to recreate a marriage in a spot that's isolated from the rest of the world, a marriage entirely on their own terms, until reality encroaches on their little fantasy.  It's a rich and intriguing and darkly tragic thriller, well worth watching.",1313107200,5,3881,4.806015037593985

4324344,5,B004C2523M,"This story is different from other noir films I've seen albeit it shares some traits. A police officer murders in cold blood the husband of a woman he is interested in for financial reasons. The cop, Webb Garwood, meets Susan, the female protagonist, when he responds to a call of a prowler around her house. He immediately puts his eyes on the property and things that Susan owns through her marriage with a well to do radio host. Well aware that Susan is to inherit a considerable amount of money from her husband he sets out to conquer the woman's heart. This is not so difficult for him to do because she is a lonely housewife, there is a considerable difference in age between Susan and husband, and her husband always works at night at the radio. In addition to this, they both come from the same hometown. Once Webb is convinced that Susan loves her, he ""prowls"" the house by making noises around her house, knowing that she will call the police. Webb gets assigned immediately to check Susan's house. Once he gets there he hides in some bushes and shoots her husband making it look like an accident. A police investigation ensues, Susan suspects Webb of foul play in spite of her love for him, but he turns out innocent during trial. Later Webb sets out to reconquer Susan by convincing her that he killed her husband accidentally and they marry. After this, the plot takes a twist and turn that I bet will surprise everyone. I had never seen such a surprising plot device introduced to obliterate what could have been a perfect crime.

It is set effectively in black and white. Although the film is not difficult to understand, it communicates characters intentions subtly, so that you have to pay close attention to the body language and facial gestures of Webb and Susan to figure out hidden intentions. We notice also that Webb is the true ""prowler"" here as he masterminds his way into Susan's heart to be able to live a wealthy lifestyle that he may never achieve as a cop. So I think this film is worthwhile for any noir fan, or any film buff who loves to watch a challenging movie. Five thumbs up.",1310860800,6,2112,4.543307086614173

4324347,4,B004C2523M,"Susan Gilvray (Evelyn Keyes) is used to being alone at night in her large Spanish style home; her husband John spends his evenings doing his own radio show for a local station. One night after a shower, Susan spots a man peeking in her window, so she calls the police to report a prowler. Officers Webb Garwood (Van Heflin) and Bud Crocker (John Maxwell) are dispatched to her home to check into the matter.

The policemen look around, but there isn't much to be seen. The recently cut grass shows no trace of footprints, not even in the vacant lot next door. They reassure the woman that they will keep an eye on the house. Officer Garwood seems particularly interested in the pretty lady, commenting on her to his partner as they leave her home. Later he returns, alone. He says he is simply doing his duty, but his interest in her is obvious. Turns out they both come from Indiana, and once upon a time she watched him play basketball. Now he's a cop, which he hates. Life cheated him out of his athletic career.

Webb worms his way into Susan's confidence and into her life, becoming obsessed with the married woman. He visits her in the absence of her husband, and she entertains and feeds him, as if he is no more than an old friend. When he goes too far and makes an advance upon her, she not only rejects him, but she indignantly slaps him and demands that he leave. But he can't seem to stay away. He returns, in uniform, to apologize, and she ends up falling into his arms.

Now he sees her all the time, her husband's voice on the radio a bizarre backdrop to their affair. There is something very odd about Webb. He's a rather bitter man, he hates his job, and it seems as if nothing is ever his fault. A prescription for unhappiness and disaster in the making.

The closer they get, the more tangled the web, until they're in so deep that they don't know which way is up or down.

I like old films of all sorts, including film noir, which I believe this qualifies as. It's in black and white, but that only adds to the noirish quality. Van Heflin--well, I just expected creepiness from him from the beginning, so I guess I was looking for it. You might remember him as D.O. Guerrero from the film Airport. He's the guy with the bomb. He has a very creepy presence in The Prowler; perhaps it's his eyes; he delivers a powerful performance as Webb Garwood. His obsession with Susan Gilvray is more than a little eerie, as are the lengths he'll go to get what he wants. In one scene, he runs out of cigarettes but she doesn't smoke. However, her husband has a carton, which he keeps locked up. Webb takes a hairpin from Susan's hair--making the very act of doing so both sensual and unnerving--and picks the lock, helping himself to a pack of cigarettes. And he also eyeballs the personal papers that are there.

While I liked the film, I felt it could have delved more into the psychology of Webb Garwood and why he is like he is. All we know is that he was a starting center on his college basketball team and he was benched after two games. Perhaps we are meant to infer that he did something to bring that about. We also know that he hates being a cop, and that he lives alone in a room at a hotel and shaves himself using an electric razor while lying in bed. Susan Gilvray seems to love her husband at first, but as the film goes on you see the cracks in the faade, which perhaps explains her loneliness and her slide into the policeman's arms.

There is a great deal of sexual tension in the film between the lonely woman and the dissatisfied policeman. I kept wondering what was going through Susan's mind that she would allow this strange man into her life, and why she let him back in after he kissed her. It is an interesting psychological study of these two characters.

The film definitely has some twists to it, and sometimes I wasn't sure which way it was going to go. The ending wasn't exactly satisfying, and left a lot of unanswered questions, but perhaps that is just meant to show that not everything can be tidied up into neat little bundles and explained away. On the whole, I enjoyed watching it. It isn't rated, but I wouldn't recommend it for children, mostly because of the adult themes, and the darkness of the subject matter. Teens and up should be fine. Would I watch it again, given the opportunity?  Probably.

Piece of trivia: Look for Aunt Harriet of TV's Batman fame in a small role. Also, I'm guessing that Dalton Trumbo wrote this under another name because he was one of the writers blacklisted during the McCarthy era. And producer S.P. Eagle is actually Sam Spiegel.",1306368000,5,4614,4.4112808460634545

The film is exciting,and not easy to predict. As their world comes crashing around them, it is the end of the film that I find a bit unsettling.  However, don`t let this put you off.  It is overall, a good film.",1306368000,6,641,4.336134453781512
4324349,4,B004C2523M,"""The Prowler"" was a film noir made in 1951, just after the peak of the style in the late 1940s, while the taste for cynical, Freudian crime films was still strong, but a 1950s sensibility was beginning to creep in. The screenplay was written by Dalton Trumbo, whose name was removed from the credits for decades due to his blacklisting for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee about communism in Hollywood. He was one of the ""Hollywood Ten"". ""The Prowler"" may be unique among film noirs for its reversal of iconic male and female roles. It features an homme fatal and his willing victim who, in falling for his enticements, falls prey to her own foibles.

Police officers Webb Garwood (Van Heflin) and Bud Crocker (John Maxwell) investigate a report of a prowler at the home of Susan Gilvray (Evelyn Keyes), a comely housewife who stays up nights to listen to her husband's radio program. Webb thinks Susan is ""quite a dish"" and decides to return at the end of his shift to check up on her. The pair discover they have a connection in their youth. They become friendly. Susan's marriage is unhappy, and Webb keeps appearing on her doorstep. He's manipulative and a bit boorish. But she can't resist. Webb has bigger plans than a fling with a frustrated housewife, though. He wants her comfortable bourgeois lifestyle too.

The crime writer James Ellroy has called ""The Prowler"" ""perv noir"". Psychosexual deviance is a common theme in film noir. ""The Prowler"" is not the most sophisticated in that respect. Rather, it is in-your-face creepy. Webb Garwood is outrightly predatory. His motives are thinly veiled, if at all. They are the motives of a femme fatale: sex as a means to money. His name is suggestive of the Black Widow. Susan Gilvray is not just a good girl attracted to a bad boy. He's a nearly sociopathic creep whom she insists on believing is honest. She plays the traditional male role in falling prey to the homme fatal, whose predations only serve to ensnare her in her own weaknesses.

It's all about sex and money, but with a dim view of post-War materialism. Webb believes in the American Dream -after a fashion. He wants to live on easy street but doesn't care for the socially acceptable ways of getting there. Van Helflin is fantastic as this working class guy, a predatory police officer, who dreams constantly of bourgeois comfort. He sees the world through covetous eyes. Appearances are all that matters. Susan married for comfort but found herself a virtual prisoner of a sterile husband who locks her out of her own furnishings. Somehow she can't resist the trouble that comes knocking. ""The Prowler""'s small budget shows, but the lead performances pack a punch.

The DVD (VCI 2011): There are 3 featurettes, an original theatrical trailer (2 min), a Press Book Photo Gallery, and an audio commentary by film noir historian Eddie Muller. ""The Cost of Living: Creating the Prowler"" (25 min) interviews authors James Ellroy, Denise Hamilton, Alan K. Rode, Eddie Muller and Dalton Trumbo's son Christopher, now deceased, about the film's production history, themes, actors, the Production Code, and its 20-day shoot. ""Masterpiece in the Margins"" (20 min) is an interview with French director Bernard Tavernier, who praises and analyses the film. ""On the Prowl: Restoring the Prowler"" (9 min) interviews archivists and preservationists at the UCLA Film & Television Archive and the Stanford Theater Film Lab about restoring this film and others.

4324351,5,B004C2523M,"Perusing through Amazon.com, I came across this soon to be released film, The Prowler, with Van Heflin as a nasty sleazy opportunist, preying on the naive, unhappily married,lonely wife (Evelyn Keyes)who meets cop Heflin when she calls the police after seeing a peeping tom was watching her take a bath.
The script is from the pen of Dalton Trumbo, a man targeted by the House of Un-American Activities,who spent years writing under pseudonyms,a very great writer indeed. It seems that with all this going for it, The Prowler couldn't miss - and it doesn't.
Heflin keeps returning to Keyes' home to check that she is ok, and the underlying sexual innuendo and double entendres raises the tension in the film as we wait and see how long it will be before he has wangled his way into her heart.
With Losey's tight direction, and Trumbo's wonderful script, backed up by fine performances of Heflin (I'd never seen him play such an evil role before this!)and Miss Keyes (always a good performer, why didn't her career take off ?,) this is a film to enjoy and appreciate - a true film noir at it's most suspenseful.

8422661,3,B004C2523M,"Saw this on TCM, hosted by Eddie Muller. I was expecting a more coherent/ believable story. I watch many film noirs, and this one simply lacked verisimilitude. Unlike Double Indemnity (which I give 5 stars), The Prowler chunked along with little context re: time table of the action. Perhaps some chunks were edited out, but I simply did not ""buy"" the rapid seduction of Susan Gilvray (Evelyn Keyes as the lonely housewife) by the creepy Webb Garwood (Van Hefflin as the bored policeman). Van Hefflin does a great job as a predatory pervert. But, I did not see any veracity to Susan's attraction to him. Susan had become consumed by her attraction to Webb -- but, why? It was simply not plausible.

Spoilers below:
Then, when Webb ""accidentally"" killed/murdered Susan's husband, she despised Webb again. But, implausibly, once again, she becomes consumed with love for him because he says it really was an accidental killing. A little more plausible than the original attraction before the killing -- but, still, this did not have the ""ring of truth"" to me.

Then, the idea of hiding out in a ghost town to birth a baby? In a dilapidated building with no water or electricity, in the desert? No, not plausible in my book. The idea of  having a baby ""too early"" makes the timing of the baby's birth critical to the plot. When the two had met and had an affair gives lie to the testimony (at the inquest) that the two had never met prior to the night of the ""accidental"" killing of the husband. An interesting idea, but not really believable that they couldn't have simply gone on vacation out of the area (to avoid having to answer questions to the local papers and friends) and had the baby out of state or far from LA. Disappear for a few months, have the baby, move back, and nobody would really know or care how old the baby was. So, this was a weak plot point, in my opinion.

Finally, the doctor fled and got the police to show up immediately. It is unknown what Susan told the doctor exactly, but it does not ring true that he would flee and bring the police, who would then shoot to kill Webb, who at that point had not really been proven to have done anything wrong -- let alone warrant being shot in the back by a policeman who was simply called to the scene! No, this ending borders on the ridiculous.

So, putting aside the accolades by Eddie Muller and others, the excellent photography, the fact that Dalton Trumbo co-wrote the screenplay this film does not live up to my standards for a good or excellent film noir.",1494892800,,2529,4.525164113785558
8422662,4,B004C2523M,"""The Prowler""  (1951)  Directed by Joseph Losey.  Screenplay by Dalton Trumbo, with Hugo Butler.  Produced by Sam Spiegel, John Huston, and Samuel Reiner.  Starring Van Heflin and Evelyn Keyes.

This movie, like ""Detour"" from 1945, can be appreciated as an example of a ""B"" noir genre effort  that overcomes a low budget with good scripting, many subtexts, and a huge sense of unremitting despair.  Like many noir flicks, it treats the police and criminals as two sides of the same coin.  It attracted disparagement from the wielders of the production code through its raw exposure of class envy and the manipulative nature of relationships between men and women.  This is a movie in which the cynicism runs very deep.

Van Heflin and Evelyn Keyes ( who was the wife of John Huston at the time) give fine performances as ""Webb Garwood"", the predatory cop, and ""Susan Gilvray"", the cultured wife who hides a lonely secret.  Garwood is a man hungry for more status than his police work can possibly bring, and he fastens on Susan Gilray by playing on her nostalgia for the Indiana background that they both share.  Its fascinating to see how he starts wooing her in plain clothes, moves too fast, and then reverts to his uniform to offer reassurances.  Neither Keyes nor Heflin wears any make-up, and both characters are obviously desperate, but for different reasons.  The tangled web they weave results in a pregnancy which she wants, but will result in the policeman's undoing--- so they are forced to hide in a barren ghost town while she gives birth.  They are reduced to being complete desperadoes, and the cave-like existence is a mockery of the comforts they pursue in trying to fulfill the ""American dream"".  ""You and me and baby makes three"" becomes a horrible nightmare, and the line between being embraced by society and becoming an outcast is shown to be thin, indeed..

""The Prowler"" is a classic of noir, but the underlying desperation makes it tough to watch.  The camera work is very good, and the tale is gripping.  The only thing that puzzled me is that in their exile in a ghost town, living with only light provided by a gas lantern, they are still able to enjoy the luxury of a portable phonograph ( a device which enables a devastating bit of irony).  Susan explains that her deceased husband had the record player ""custom built"", and indeed it is exceptional, playing without having to be plugged into electricity.",1494806400,,2436,4.793764988009593

A great film noir of a cop gone bad George Nader has a bit part as the photographer on the church steps. Fans of the cast will like this the most.",1467676800,,260,4.117647058823529

8422665,3,B004C2523M,"As much as I have learned to appreciate the acting range of Van Heflin (see ""3 Musketeers"" and ""Shane"" and ""3:10 to Yuma"") I was  surprised how THE PROWLER had not much more to offer.  Despite the extras telling me how Heflin's cop is the most perverted character of the 1940's - I just didn't get that ""sleazy"" of an appreciation for the movie or the character.  As a matter-of-fact this ""Prowler"" manages to keep his foot in the door by 'playing hard to get!'
Anyways, Evelyn Keyes - who began to look more like Lana Turner as movie progressed, especially the platinum blonde hair - did not get anywhere near the 'juicy' role Lana Turner got in ""A Postman Always Rings Twice"".  As a matter of fact her ""married"" woman who suspects the troubled, hates-his-job, cop 'boyfriend' is not what he might seem SUDDENLY gets dumb, or blind, because - oh, I don't know, she just gets naive because he was good in the sack...I guess.  Oh, they almost knew each other from their high school days in Indiana, too.
The restoration of this movie by the UCLA film commission seems quite well done.
3 stars.",1457136000,3,1092,4.522842639593908
