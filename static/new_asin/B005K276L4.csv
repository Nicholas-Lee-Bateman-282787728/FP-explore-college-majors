4715201,5,B005K276L4,"Great beginning. They actually see the brain being self reflective and taking care of itself. They do not conclude that the brain is more than a body, namely that it also involves self reflective mind.

4715203,5,B005K276L4,"One of the most important documentaries ever made.  This information puts the solution to mental disorders of all kinds within reach of us all, and all without medication of any kind.  All mental disorders such as PTSD, ADD, ADHD, co-dependency, brain retardation, stroke damage, compulsive behavior, and more, can be managed and nearly eliminated through the brains ability to create new neurons that support normal, healthy thinking.",1471737600,2,435,5.477611940298507

4715210,5,B005K276L4,"This was a very informative documentary. I enjoyed it, especially the near ending (last 10-23 minutes.) The talking pig part made me laugh a little (see watch documentary and you will know what I am talking about) I don't regret watching this documentary at all and found watching it very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend watching this documentary if you are considering to watch it, which you most likely are you are reading this review.

4715211,5,B005K276L4,"Astounding, miraculous, spell-binding film about how the brain can adjust and compensate after the body has suffered traumatic injury.  Unbelievable, until you see the actual results.  This is a fascinating, must-watch video.  I knew the human body was amazing, but this is jaw-dropping stuff.  The film is aimed at average, non-medical people.",1497916800,3,344,5.5576923076923075

I would recommend this book to anyone that may have health issues, and personality issues. This book challenges the watcher that the brain can change.",1495238400,,294,4.764705882352941
4715213,4,B005K276L4,"I watched this documentary in hopes that the issue of what happens to our brains as we age would be addressed. Both my mother and my grandmother died with dementia, which leads me to believe that heredity plays a part in what will happen with me. I will soon be 70 years old and I have already begun to exhibit signs that I am in the early onset of the disease. I am having an extremely hard time in coping with the signs that say I will be a third generation recipient and do not know how to live with the disease.  I would really like to watch more videos which this issue is being addressed and how hopeful the medical professionals are that major advancements are being made to stop and/or delay the deterioration of this debilitating disease of the brain.",1494979200,6,760,4.352112676056338

4715215,5,B005K276L4,"I chose this video because I live with epilepsy and bipolar disorder. I am constantly seeking new information because I believe there are better ways to treat...even cure through healing the brain. The drugs I take do not completely control my conditions and they come with a multitude of side effects. Although there some slight genetic link on one side of my family in regards to epilepsy, my mother had a very difficult delivery and due to the risks of her very high blood pressure, I was delivered with forceps. I was born in 1968, C-sections were not common, perhaps even not used during that time. My mother said when she first saw me after delivery, my entire face was very bruised, especially the temporal regions and they also had noticeable indentions. I had my first seizure, a grand mal, at age 5 and was hospitalized shortly for testing. A specific brain wave was found to be abnormal in relation to a ""normal"" brain and I was put on phenobarbital, the only drug available at that time to treat epilepsy. Later, I was switched to Dilantin when that became available. I am left handed. I had difficulty in school under the influence of these drugs. Handwriting was very difficult to learn. However, because I lived in right handed world, I learned to use certain tools like scissors very effectively and I posses a higher degree of ambidexterity than most individuals. Many of my motor tasks are still right brain oriented but some I can easily switch between either hand. At age 11, because no further seizures occurred, medication was discontinued. Needless to say, I went from a struggling C level student to A's and B's. When I entered my late teens/early twenties, I started to have a different form of seizure known as JME. They were partially controlled. I was allergic to many medications or could not withstand the side effects. My brain became kindled and grand mals started to occur with increasing frequency. I was also diagnosed with bi polar disorder in my 20's which could be a mood disorder that developed from the seizures. They shake hands somewhere. Now I am 48. I have been implanted with a VNS device which seems to help mildly with depressive episodes which are season in nature. I do not have full seizure control. I remain on meds for both conditions. I live the healthiest that I am able. I follow a low carb diet but not low enough to be considered ketogenic. I have recently started to use some Buddhist rituals to see if they will help and I go to a therapist who uses DBT as the main treatment from a psychological aspect. In my deepest of being I believe eventually there will be a way to teach our brains how to regulate the biochemistry. I worked in the medical field as a radiation therapist and radiologic technology so I can fully understand the materials I have been able to locate. I think biofeedback and imagination may be the route. I can't have TMS because of the VNS device..which I question if constant stimulation of that nature is the healthiest route. I know I suffer from frequent insomnia that disappears when I turn the device off via the magnet. The lack of sleep contributes to existing health conditions. I'm highly photosensitive. Computer usage must be limited due to the refresh rate of monitors available at this time and I have the best possible screen. I am disabled. I frequently can not drive. I can not swim or bath without some supervision and of course there is SUDEP which has taken the lives of many prematurely. I'm telling my story because this was based more on motor sensory and control than behavioral and biochemical and those like me need these techniques to be looked at on a broader spectrum. If there are any out there who see this or are involved in anyway with these type of innovations that may benefit others with neurological deficits, I beg you to please share anything you think will help. The memory games might override the memory, balance, and word recall that I personally suffer from due to the medications which we know alter cellular structure. I will be attempting to contact the professionals in this video in hopes they may be able to offer some methods in which a broader spectrum of those in need can benefit from and I was amazed by the results. From my deepest convictions come the gratitude for the work you have done and are doing. I believe you are on the cusp of even more phenomenal discoveries which can be extended to humanity. I wanted to add that music might be interesting to use with these treatments because it's ability to stimulate the entire brain. Just a thought.

Respectfully, Julie Gianferrara.",1494374400,,4621,4.683886838868388

4715222,5,B005K276L4,"This film provides a great introduction to the concept and reality of neuroplasticity. This involves the brain's ability to rewire itself so that significant healing can take place.  People who have suffered strokes, traumatic brain injuries, PTSD, and brain damage prior to (or after) birth can greatly benefit from watching this with loved ones.

I have experienced the plasticity of the brain first hand as I had a stroke a few years ago and had to re-learn many things, using new parts of the brain that weren't affected by the stroke. I was impressed by some of the techniques that were shown in this film, and happy to see that there are doctors who have found a way to improve the function of even damaged brains.

Over the last thirty years, I've observed my brain changing itself, coming back from a scalpel-slip that locked me into a world where I could remember nothing for more than ten minutes. My neurologist told me to expect no improvement, and my company offered to lavishly retire me at age 32. To me, both options sounded dreadful. (These days, I'd have the sense to take the retirement, then get a job, duh!)

If you met me today, you might be able to trip me up by telling me your name and then immediately asking me what your name is, or by asking me to remember directions that involve two or more turns, but the only other obvious clue is that I ALWAYS carry a 3x5 index card in my pocket, and write on it constantly.

Doidge apparently had been well aware of the brain properties that I learned about as neuroplasticity in grad school in the fifties.  The big difference that came later that he dealt with was making good theoretical and therapeutic use of that knowledge.  I actually learned from the movie even from work with which I was quite familiar.

So great to see science finally supporting my personal view and to also see how so many are benefitting medically from this deviation from traditionally accepted science.,1474329600,,334,4.87719298245614

4715553,4,B005K276L4,"Very interesting and well explained cases showing neural plasticity and the fact our brains are not static hardware. It did bother me they took this to mean our brains are not like computers. The fact our brain physically changes in reaction to thought processes can be likened to software which interacts with mechanical tools which rearrange hardware to be more efficient for the specific softwares purpose. In other words it shows brains to be complex self-modifying computers.

Overall this point wasn't key to learning something from this presentation. Very interesting stuff that'll make you wonder if we'll soon be creating new senses with technology.",1473811200,3,658,5.326923076923077
