6376838,5,B00JLC57OW,"Who says cancer support groups can't be uplifting? On the first official ""open"" day of the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival, I managed to catch a film that wasn't part of the press screenings I have attended for the past three weeks. And was it worth it! The Egyptian Theatre was filled to the rafters with fans of the wildly popular Young Adult novel by John Green; it was fun to watch the audience telegraph each phase of this realistic look at young people dealing with malignancies. The young gal next to me pulled out some tissue in anticipation of one sad scene and wriggled with glee when something funny was coming up.

This film is loaded with humor, but it also has powerful performances by stellar actors. The author was on set during the filming, so he was downstairs while the mother and daughter were doing an extremely emotional scene in an upstairs bedroom. Green became so agitated when he heard the girl's voice, they had to restrain him from barging in on the scene to comfort her.

We admire:
  * Shailene Woodley (""Divergent"") is Hazel, our young heroine, suffering from terminal cancer, who schleps her oxygen equipment everywhere she goes...including Anne Frank's attic in Amsterdam!
  * Ansel Elgort (""Divergent"" - he was her brother in that one) Gus refuses to be pulled into Hazel's negative space, but he does it with such wit and charm, she can't help but respond.
  * Laura Dern (""Enlightened"") is our heroine's happily married mother, insightful, supportive and consistently loving.
  * Sam Trammell (""True Blood"") is her father, who isn't sure his girl has enough strength for a friendship like this.
  * Nat Wolff (""Stuck in Love"") is their best friend Isaac who has lost one eye to cancer and now is confronted with the possibility of losing the other...plus a girlfriend. He shows us the therapeutic value of venting one's rage. We LOVED the scene with the eggs!
  * Willem Dafoe (""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") is Peter Van Houten, a much-admired author they want to meet.
  * Lotte Verbeek (""Outlander""!) is his lovely personal assistant.

Kudos to Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber for adapting this poignant novel for its legions of youthful fans. There is no profanity, nudity, gunfire, vehicular mayhem or blowie uppie stuff. This audience left the theater very, very happy.",1400976000,16,2323,4.885204081632653

6376871,5,B00JLC57OW,"I'm not a person that cries a lot but I have to say, after reading the book and buying this movie, I cried from the beginning to the end. When I was reading the book I thought I was tough enough as I didn't cry until the last sentence. ""You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers"" It summarizes the book so wonderfully that when you look back every sentence was loaded with emotions. This movie was the same. Every moment was so precious that defined their choices of loving each other and not regret about it. I guess in the end we don't need a million admires do we, we just need to be loved by one so deeply and that's enough for the whole life",1520985600,,743,3.96

6376882,5,B00JLC57OW,"First and foremost, this was a sad love story and a grand love story.  It's worth watching.  I don't know anything about the book.  I think the movie shows clearly that whether or not there is a creator (and I believe not) sometimes life deals you a bad hand, sometimes a fatally bad hand.  It sucks.  There's no reason why, it just is.  And there's no guiding force making anything happen.  Again, stuff happens.  It's meaningful to us while we're living and hopefully meaningful to others after we're gone.  We make our own meaning.  But there is no eternal meaning.  The universe doesn't care.  If believing in a loving god makes you feel good, great for you.  The problem is when people become organized about it and try to control others through it, specifically politically.  At that point it's no longer just for personal comfort but used in the worst possible way.  I want to write more about this but not now and not here.  For now, this was a good movie, but my endorsement of it does not mean I endorse a religious worldview.  In fact, I wasn't even certain that the characters in the movie did this (I guess different viewers will see it differently).  According to Wikipedia, the author identifies as a Christian.  I will end this review by stating again that this was a sad love story and a grand love story.  I'm glad I watched it.  It would have been even better if religion was left out of it.",1519516800,,1410,4.47244094488189

6376898,5,B00JLC57OW,"One of the greatest movies to be released...I see some negative reviews. They don't understand the concept of the movie or they came to watch the movie after reading the book like the way other transitions are. It does follow close to the book; but it's Hollywood. This movie is in my Top 5 and it's definitely a tear jerker at spots. Shailene Woodley gives a great performance as the character Hazel. There are 2 spots where it looks like she fumbles through the lines/overacts, but keep in mind, she's playing a role that very FEW people can play and she went above and beyond. Same went for Anset Elgort in the role of Gus. Will Dafoe plays another role as a drunk has-been more towards the end of the movie..and I won't go too much further than that..if you haven't read the book and want to see this movie...don't bother with the book, get the movie and check it out. It's a great movie with an awesome cast, a great storyline, a ton of inspiring quotes, a cliffhanger for an ending and a fun setting. One of the things that you can take away from this movie is the sense of knowing that not all illnesses are visible to the eye. You won't be disappointed with this purchase...trust me.",1514678400,,1191,4.418181818181818

The story is obviously a chick-flick, but don't let that stop you from watching the movie ( or reading the book ), the plot really opens your eyes to the viewing of cancer. The reason I gave it a 4.5 is because, like any movie that was based on a book, it has some differences from the book. Its been awhile since I have read it but if I remember correctly, Isaac had blonde hair in the book, but in the movie, he didnt. Besides the tiny differences, It is amazing and I will recommend it to almost anyone ( 13 and older ).",1509667200,,542,4.027777777777778

I read the book because I was familiar with the author via the vlog he and his brother Hank have been doing for a long time and I like both of them.  Generating enthusiasm for reading a book about a teenage girl with cancer who falls in love with a boy who lost one leg to cancer is an impossible task, but the people will draw you in and hold you there and help you to learn some useful lessons in ways that will move you tears and help you to laugh through them.  The story is about how good life can be in spite of how bad it can seem.

Also,had pently people in my family die from cancer in real life but they got to live past their 40's,get married,have kids,and grandchildren,So to me the their journey in life was great but people who only get to live to see (8),(16),or (20)well that's got to be the one of the deepest,and hardest pains for families to deal with.

I was glad I didn't, because even though I could tell where it was going, I enjoyed discovering things about the main characters. I liked that it ends on something of a high note, without telling you if Hazel Grace lives to have a long, full life, or the expected shorter one.

6377075,5,B00JLC57OW,"I really enjoyed this movie for the faithfulness it had to the books. The movie starts out light-heartedly despite the illness that is faced by the main characters. Gus/Ansel is such a sweetheart. Exactly how I imagined Gus to be. Shaliene never disappoints. The only criticism I have is that at times some lines are delivered kind of dryly by the actors. This is romance, and just like pain, it demands to be felt, so the oft dry delivery makes the romance hard to be believable.

6377110,4,B00JLC57OW,"#1 Best-selling novel, The Fault in Our Stars, written by John Green, was turned into a cinematic success in June of 2014. This beautifully written, yet agonizing story has a superior storyline, as well as a thought provoking plot seen throughout the film. The intriguing love story has its ups and downs, in which the film director has done a phenomenal job at showing, while keeping the audience at the edge of their seats begging to know more.
Hazel Grace Lancaster, played by Shailene Woodley, is perceived as an outcast. A teenage girl who longs to live a life to the fullest but struggles to do so. As a thirteen year old, Hazel was diagnosed with cancer, forcing her to lug around a oxygen tank wherever she goes. When she meets Augustus (Gus) Waters, played by Ansel Elgort, at a cancer support group she instantly falls in love. Augustus is an outspoken seventeen year old who wishes to be remembered on the Earth but also jokes here and there about his prosthetic leg (in which he lost due to cancer). (Spoiler Alert!) Throughout their journey of true love, it is clear to the audience that happily ever after isn't an option for this pair of teenagers. The couple -and us- are taken on an emotional roller coaster filled with the ups and downs of cancer, love, and ultimately, living.
Although the film is based on the novel, the words don't seem to fit in with the generation. As an audience member, the film seemed thrown together and very unrealistic (nobody travels across the world to meet their favorite author, just to receive the answers to the final questions of the book). Similar to the romantic film We Got Mail, it lacks the flair and originality everybody is wanting in a new film. The teenagers have their own forever and always like every romantic film has. Okay is used to make the romance stronger, yet it takes away the realistic romance the author, John Green, does exceptionally well at making clear in the novel. Although based on the novel, the film seemed to be a mirror image with no sudden surprises or unexpected twists in the plot, making it seem very plain and lacking the flair that romantic films such as The Notebook and Dear John have.
While other times, the romantic sayings such as I fell in love like you fall asleep, slowly then all at once, and perhaps okay will be our always,  precisely placed into scenes make the audience long for a happily ever after for the two love struck teenagers. During the emotional scenes, the silence was always filled with pop alternative music (All I Want -Kodaline), which formed a lump in your throat causing it to swell up as the scene intensifies. Throughout the entire film, you are left to question the meaning of the characters decisions, one thing I loved about John Greens storyline. As a couple they learn the world is not a wish granting factory, something that may seem irrelevant right away but serves a purpose throughout the couples journey. Many lessons are taught to this young group of people, many of which make the audience question the amount of things they have taken for granted in their lives. Towards the end of the film, all of the questions wandering around in your head are answered in the most unexpected way.
This beautiful cinematic success focuses on romance, the struggle of wanting to be a normal teenager, as well as worrying about the oblivion, something that Gus does constantly. Throughout the journey of the two teenagers love story, many lessons are learned and many hearts are broken. Just like Hazels favorite book An Imperial Affliction stated Pain demands to be felt. It is safe to say this film left the audience heartbroken.",1476748800,,3652,4.715179968701095

Go into this one with a new box of Kleenex, and I'd strongly suggest it be the jumbo size box - you'll need it.

Strongly feel that this story, with minor edits, would be a MUCH better story to have kids dive into than Romeo and Juliet.  Everyone will one day face a reality of someone close to them with cancer or some other ailment.  The message here is that life is precious, live it to the fullest, and R&J is a tragic love story, and there is a place for that I guess, but this story has a life lesson we can all relate to.",1474934400,2,734,4.237410071942446

I debated myself on watching this movie for a long time because I wasn't a big fan of ""The Secret Life Of The American Teenager"" on The Family Channel a few years back which is what I think Shailene Woodley is most known for, that show was just terrible acting & juvenile writing/story plots. But, she & her co-stars really showed their acting skills in this movie & it had a fantastic story line. You definitely wanna have a box of tissues nearby because it's an emotional roller coaster - SO GOOD & highly recommended! So glad I bought this movie because I will watch it over & over again. A great movie for when you just want to veg out on some good chick flick movies.

6377202,3,B00JLC57OW,"I read the book first so I was disappointed and annoyed that Augustus Waters in the movie did not have blue eyes since she (Hazel) ranted and raved often in the book about his beautiful blue eyes. I was also a little wigged-out that they cast Ansel Elgort as Shailene Woodley's lover due to the fact that he played opposite her in the Divergent trilogy as her mousy brother. There are hundreds of actors out there; they could not find a blue-eyed actor that never played her brother in other films? I really found that odd and a little uncomfortable. The movie of course did not closely follow the book which is nothing unusual - just annoying! In the book there were no curse words but of course the infamous ""F"" word had to be implemented into the movie - why? The movie was OK but not one of my favorites.",1468281600,,808,4.357615894039735

It's about falling in love! (whether you are sick or healthy, it goes beyond that) The book is even better, I feel they left out important stuff, like for instance the reason behind the title of the movie/book... But it's still good on its own! It reminds you, no matter how hard and complex life is, love is simple when its with the right person...

I'm a mess right now. I cried so much that my face hurts and I can't breathe, but this was an incredible movie and such a touching love story.
After reading the book, it does such a fantastic job of portraying what I had envisioned. I loved Augustus in the book and I loved him in the film. The two actors that play Augustus and Hazel were so well suited to the roles.
I did notice a few changes to suit the film, but it was alright....
This is one of those movies that I could watch again and again. So heartbreaking, yet, so real. Plus I laughed out loud so many times. Just all around wonderful movie.
Maybe not a date night movie, since you're guaranteed to break out the ugly cry, but totally worth watching it any other time. :-)

I didn't read the book, and I waited quite awhile to watch the movie, because I originally thought it seemed a little... overhyped. But a night or two ago I decided to give it a go and this movie is actually pretty great. I really enjoyed the acting and, as another commenter stated, it's definitely one of those bittersweet movies. I was literally simultaneously smiling and crying. It's heartwarming and heart-wrenching. And of course, the relationship is as perfect as it could be.

The teenage years are when we feel such passionate love as these teenagers in 'Stars' what makes the story so watchable but this film has a twist as both the leads have cancer.
The Fault in our stars appeals to our innermost romantic and is worth a watch. The two leads especially Shailene Woodley are just terrific. I enjoyed this love story because it was so different and especially because of Woodley. Release date: June 6th, 2014.",1451692800,,612,4.623853211009174

The acting is good, the music is excellent, and the tears on my face were real.  I haven't felt so much emotion from a movie since watching Schindler's List in middle school.

6377554,5,B00JLC57OW,"It took me a long time to finally read John Green's bestselling novel, The Fault in Our Stars. My life was intimately touched by cancer a couple years ago, so I needed time to become emotionally ready to read the tragic tale. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the book was not the tear-jerking cancer story I feared it would be. Yes, it is about kid's with cancer, but the book is more a bittersweet once in a lifetime kind of love story. The genuine characters, sharp writing, and deeper questions of mortality and legacy made for a very strong novel.

Fortunately the film adaptation of the novel remains true to the book and manages to capture much of the magic from the text. The film follows Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a teenager who is fighting a terminal case of cancer. She is on an experimental medication that keeps her disease at bay, but she will eventually succumb to her illness. An only child, Hazel spends her days reading, attending college classes, or watching T.V. with her parents. At the insistence of her mother, Hazel finds herself at a weekly support group for critically ill teens.

It is at these meetings that Hazel meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a lanky, attractive, former high school basketball star who lost a leg to cancer. The two form an immediate connection, and we watch as their young love blossoms. They bond over Hazel's favorite book, An Imperial Affliction, and obsess about the book's ending, or lack thereof. Their curiosity leads them to contact the book's author, Peter Van Houten (Willem Defoe), and even travel to Amsterdam to visit with him. A plot twist near the end brings their entire relationship into question and forces the two to face realities neither of them are prepared for.

The two leading actors expertly portray the humor, angst, and wonder of two young people falling in love. The stellar performances by each member of the cast helps to elevate what could easily be a cheesy Lifetime Channel romance story into something more. Laura Dern as Hazel's overprotective mother, does a particularly fantastic job as a woman facing the possibility of losing her only daughter. Cancer is a difficult subject to talk about and can easily become morbid and cliche. This film approaches the subject with a respectful lightness and humor, making the tragic elements easier to stomach. There are a couple minor changes from the book, but none of them have a negative effect on the story. Fans of the novel will be pleased that this adaptation maintains the romance, hope, sadness and wit of Green's story.",1439510400,,2572,4.840909090909091

6377592,5,B00JLC57OW,"Based on John Greens immensely popular novel by the same name, adapted for the screen with extreme skill by Scott Neustader and Michael H. Weber, and directed with sensitivity and taste by Josh Boone THE FAULT IN OUR STARS steps so far beyond expectations that it may just be another Nicholas Sparks young adults tearjerkers and actually becomes one of the more impressive dialogues about death and dying and the meaning and importance of love. Add to that a cast of young actors (an experienced actors) who live their roles and the result is a film that should be experienced by everyone.

Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus (Ansel Elgort) are two teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps them on a journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous, given that Hazel's other constant companion is an oxygen tank, Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they meet and fall in love at a cancer support group. Add to that the presence of Gus best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) who also has cancer which makes him lose his eyes (and his mental stability at times) and we have a trio of youth facing enormous odds who end up discovering the real meaning of being alive in the world and the importance of love. Hazels parents are (for once in film) sincerely supportive in the face of a dying child and realistically portrayed by the brilliant Laura Dern and Sam Trammel. Hazel and Gus travel to Amsterdam to visit Hazels favorite novelist Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) and discover he is a smarmy drunk who lives with the compassionate Lidewij (Lotte Verbeek). Sharing how the story plays out would involve spoilers for those who have not read the book.

The on screen chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgot sends this film into that rarefied realm of becoming a classic. But for this viewer, even more important is the lesson it offers about the process and concept and meaning and insignificance of death as an ending: it is a continuation.

By doing that I got myself a box of tissues and my blanket so I could cuddle in with it. The movie was really good. It made me laugh at all the right parts, it made me smile, and sadly I must say it.it even made me cry a lot of times. The Fault in Our Stars is the most awesome movie ever. Even if its about two cancer patients that met at a Support Group for other Cancer Kids around their ages. They met, they become friends, and slowly they start to fall in love. Well mostly Gus at first because he likes to admit it but Hazel never did admit it until they get to Amsterdam.

I guess the main reason is because Hazel just never really wanted to hurt Augustus, Gus, like other Cancer Kids do eventually. And when I say eventually I mean that as the most heartwarming kindness that I can because any story that has cancer in it someone will die. You just know it. I did when I read the back of the book but then again I also knew it because someone at my high school told me that back when I was in high school about four years ago now. But anyways Augustus and Hazel has, or have if you want to be cruel to your own heart, the most amazing love story that any young teenage person can have with cancer in their lives.

These two are just two wonderful people that shouldnt have had cancer in their lives at all and should be able to live a happily ever after like most people their own ages. Including Isaac. He shouldnt have had to have his eyes removed and be blind for the rest of his life. I cried my hardest at every single part whenever someone else cried because I felt like I was apart of their lives even if as Peter Van Houten would say that they are literary characters and that we shouldnt matter with what happened to them. I say that he is full of bulls*** because with the characters in this book and the characters that we hear of from An Imperial Affliction that they all matter, and that what happened to the person that died, loved ones they also matter in what happens afterward for them.

I mean I care for Hazel, Isaac, and everyone in #TIFOS in both the books and the movies since anyone that has been hurt by Death taking one of their loved ones will know that they will live on forever in that persons heart. Trust me I lost my great aunt and my grandfather, one when it was her time and the other from cancer, I just like to think that my heart has room for Gus and Hazel and everyone else in The Fault in Our Stars family because Cancer is just a thing that is made up of you that will eventually kill you and there is no way out of it since Pain is inevitable.

I hope that you also like this movie as much as I did and that you will walk the rest of the day and the rest of your life knowing that you bared witness to the most wonderful love story ever of Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster. Who shall ever be in my heart. Okay? Okay.

6377640,5,B00JLC57OW,"'Hazel' (Shailene Woodley) has a terminal illness, she is encouraged to attend groups where she
will meet young people with a variety of illnesses, this is where she meets 'Gus' (Ansel Elgort)
The two find they have similar outlooks to life and share an off-beat humour.
Despite his difficulties after a lower leg amputation, 'Gus' has a light-hearted approach to life.
'Hazel' and 'Gus' get on well together from the word go, the depression that constantly hovers over
'Hazel' lifts when they are together.
'Gus's' family offer to take 'Hazel' to 'Amsterdam' where she'd meet her favourite author, it's a trip
of a lifetime that's on offer, an ambition fulfilled.
However the medic's tell her that she is too poorly, a long-haul trip is out of the question.
'Gus' wants to get closer to 'Hazel' however knowing she has so little time it wouldn't make sense,
she suggests they just remain good-, though he fully understands what she's saying he tells her
it's a journey he'd be happy to share.
Despite the difficulties with their daughters health, and the equipment that has to travel with them,
'Hazel's' parents organise a trip to Amsterdam, her parents wanting their daughter to fulfil her dream,
'Gus' travels with 'Hazel' and her mum.
In Amsterdam they get to meet 'Peter Van Houten' (Williem Defoe) the author, he turns out to be both
eccentric and very rude, he's also an alcoholic, the author bursts her bubble some, though his wife
try's to show more pleasant approach than her husband and takes them to a few special places of
interest to the couple.
'Hazel' has to overcome her limitations to take that one step further than her condition really permits,
however they do enjoy the three day mini-holiday.
Romance between them had blossomed during the trip, though they both know there is no long-term
future for them, making the best of the time they have is what counts.
'Gus' has a secret he has to reveal about himself before too long.
The film though perhaps predictable by nature is a heart-wrenching yet somehow beautifully portrayed
drama.
The film is a tear-jerker, you may well need a box of tissues, not everyone's cup of tea perhaps, however
if you do like movies such as this it's really brilliantly portrayed.

The acting is terrible, they are not very convincing at all. It is like you are watching a high school play rather than a movie.

They also seems like high school students rather than adults.

Don't bother with this movie at all. If you want to see some version of this movie I recommend ""A Walk To Remember"" or ""Love Story"". Both movies are much, much better version of the same story.",1434326400,7,577,4.2272727272727275

6377676,5,B00JLC57OW,It is hard to put a review of this movie into more than a few words because it's one of those films you just have to tell people to watch. I highly recommend reading the book (preferably before) but even after it will still catch you off guard/spark strong emotions. The film was the best/truest adaptation of a book into a film I've experienced.  It has very good acting and a strong message that will invoke everyone to at least get choked up during multiple points along the movie.  There is a reason so many people have flocked to John Green's novels and why so many are being made into movies: they're just well done/thought out.  Definitely worth a watch/read.

The emotional roller-coaster that this movie put me through was exhausting.

Before the movie began I had this preconceived notion about how the movie was going to flow, but the twist near the end broke me and led me to tears.

6377801,4,B00JLC57OW,"Two Indianapolis teenagers Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgort) meet at a cancer support group. Hazel is a clever 16-year-old girl with thyroid cancer, who has dry humor and sarcasm, and Gus is an outgoing 17-year-old boy with bone cancer. As you expect, Hazel and Gus fall in love with one another.

Hazels favorite book is An Imperial Affliction, which ends in abrupt way, and Hazel has long been curious to know what happens after that. Her e-mail correspondence with the author Peter van Houten, currently living in Amsterdam, leads to an unexpected result.

Based on John Greens novel, The Fault in Our Stars belongs to a familiar genre called tearjerker, and some part of the events in Amsterdam is not really convincing, but the film itself, especially the first half of it, is witty and funny with slick direction. The story gets sentimental towards the end, maybe a little poignant, but not sugary or maudlin.

The greatest part of The Fault in Our Stars is the star Shailene Woodley, who was impressive in The Descendants. Also, Nat Wolff is equally good as Guss best friend.",1428019200,,1096,4.850267379679145

This isn't the type of movie I long to see but with so much hype around it I had to see it. Love the move and happy I purchased it and will watch it many more times after I read the book.

6377898,1,B00JLC57OW,"This movie is the most pretentious phony tween tragedy/rom-com that I have ever had the dis-pleasure of acknowledging the existence of.

Full Disclosure: I could only stomach a few minutes as I skipped through the first part of the film, mostly on mute.

Where to even begin?  Perhaps most glaring of all is the main female character, Hazel, who sports tubes into her nose which are never fully explained.  Now, in all seriousness, has anybody ever seen somebody casually walking around the mall with tubes in their nose, yet looking like a Hollywood Starlet?

The main female and male leads are so phony, predictable, and full of cliches that I cannot even begin to enumerate them.

I did not read the book, I was simply bombarded by trailers and commercials until I had to at least try viewing the film.  Please note, however, the lightning speed with which this movie made its way from the theatres to cable - a sure sign that it made zero money, and is just plain awful.

In sum, you have to be 13 years old, or have the mindset of a 13 year old, to get anything out of this film.  Perhaps 10-12 is a more appropriate age bracket.  Either way, this movie attempts to pull on your heart strings using cancer but portraying the characters as upbeat, beautiful, and on an amazing journey of self discovery.  Perhaps the worst movie of the year, and the most obvious example of how detached Hollywood is from the other 99.9% of the population.",1425600000,,1443,4.575875486381323
6377899,5,B00JLC57OW,"The Fault in Our Stars is a tale that depicts the inseparable relationship between love and suffering. It is a truthful portrayal of the human experience. The content of the movie is raw and realistic. The main character, Hazel, contemplates throughout the whole meaning a question that strikes at the heart of every person: what is the meaning of suffering? I think a key point exemplified by the film is that suffering is only bearable with love. This is shown through the unconditional and sacrificial relationship of Hazel and Gus as well as Hazels parents intense love for their daughter. Suffering is only understandable through the eyes of love and that is a truth that needs to be communicated. This film is more than a generational romantic tale; it is an inspiring depiction of the truth of human experience brought to the big screen.",1425513600,,844,4.868055555555555

It was very close to the book although like all movies based on books, a few things were dropped that help tie the story together.  It still works great though.  I love Shailene Woodley. She is going to be one of those actresses that is around forever.  She has a way of sucking you into loving her character.  I recommend you do read the book.  The author is a very good writer who makes you laugh and cry, which translated well into a movie.  The movie is sad but very true life like.  I have been work in the medical field and can tell you, the thoughts and emotions that go into this movie are so right on point.  I bought the movie to watch anytime I need a good cry.  If you are a female, you know what I mean.  For the males out there, my husband liked the movie, but hate that it got to him so much, he too cried.  He did admit it was good though, even though he had never read the book and doesn't plan to either.  He doesn't want to cry any more than he already has. ; )  So, I would totally recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 13, just because there is a small, not to dirty sex scene.

The actors playing Hazel and Gus completely make this movie, and breathe charming, innocent, young life into two very dull, two-dimensional characters in the book. A little angsty, a little contrived, but hey, what do you expect from yet another terminally-ill, star-crossed teen love story? This is ""A Walk To Remember"" revamped, except everyone has cancer in this version, not just the girl. Of course it's going to have vast amounts of cheese in it. But fortunately, the delightful acting of the two main stars helps you forget the irksome flaws of the book.

6378026,2,B00JLC57OW,"Based on the best-selling novel by John Green and starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is an occasionally poignant, but contrived, story about love and life. The plot is really easy to summarize, as it follows the basic YA formula of having two people who are quite different enter into a romance with each other. The only difference, and what I feel to be most contrived part of all, is that both of them have cancer. I wouldn't necessarily call myself cynical, but this seems to me like one of the cheapest ways to get audience sympathy. I suppose John Green set out to write a ridiculously depressing tearjerker of a novel, and for its target demographic it seems to have worked like a charm. However, I am not so easily swayed and this film didn't work on me the way it might work for others. That's not to say it wasn't well-made or well-acted, because it is, but the story felt deliberately constructed to get a certain reaction and in that respect, again for me, it failed. Neither one of the leads was particularly likeable or interesting to me, and some of the dialogue they were given to say felt odd and unnatural: stuff I can't really picture teenagers actually saying. I also thought that the voiceover was a weak point, as it kind of gives away the endgame a little too early and removes tension about the main character's survival. Still, it wasn't all bad. I did enjoy the segment of the film in which Hazel and Augustus travel to Amsterdam to meet the writer of Hazel's favorite novel, ""An Imperial Affliction."" I won't spoil the cameo for those who haven't seen the film, but I enjoyed his character and the brutal honesty he portrays, despite him being somewhat of an a-hole. I also did appreciate some of the conclusions that the film draws about the relationships we have with others and what we leave behind. It's just a bit sad that the film wallows in so much misery and self-pity to get there. Not having read the book and not usually liking this type of film, I already know that this probably wasn't meant for me. Still, I like to go in with an open mind and give certain things a shot, especially when they're generally well-received. I'd hesitate to call this a bad film, but I will say I didn't like it. Fans of the book will probably love the hell out of this, but I was left mostly cold.",1423612800,,2349,4.477855477855478

I could not care less whatever else happened in the film after that. Whenever you mention one of the greatest Indiana Pacers players of all time, you get thumbs up from me. But so you know, the actual story was tremendous. Shailene Woodley is one of the best young actresses of today and she simply shines as Hazel. You simply could not have asked for a better counterpart for Woodley than Ansel Elgort. They made it very difficult to look away from the screen even for a split second.

This movie will make you think ""Will I ever come across another movie that touches my heart like this one?"" The Characters are portrayed very well by the actors. The director Josh Boone did a significant job of honoring their love without recoiling away from the abrasive moments. Egort and Woodley have amazing chemistry and it shows in the film, they were truly comfortable. This movie pulled at all the strings of my heart ! This was the movie of 2014, and that is my utmost honest opinion. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you do right away !

I thought the acting was superb and both the characters, and their interactions to be believable. I also loved the dialogue.  I found myself laughing, and of course, crying. I cried my eyes out during some very touching scenes in this movie. I didn't find the movie depressing, I found it to be very thought provoking. The movie made me feel grateful for all the blessings I have. It really made me think of the importance of our lives; the fragility of our lives. I'm a hopeless romantic, and don't mind a good tear jerker, so this movie was right up my alley.
  The movie was recommended to me by a friend, and after hearing the plot, I hesitated to watch it. I really thought it would be depressing, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really enjoyed it. I could watch it over and over again. I just fell in love with it. It will make you cry.

6378979,2,B00JLC57OW,"I read the book, and watched the movie, and the movie simply did not do the book justice. While the book felt layered, literary, dark, and revealing, the movie did far less to scratch the emotional surface. The movie was about 2 kids who fall quickly into love (and they happen to have cancer), whereas the book drives at many more compelling questions and themes; how the hell do I live my life, when I know that there isn't enough of it left, how to die with dignity, what does it mean to live a purposeful life, how society saps the personhood from people will disabilities or illness, and how do different people cope with their mortality. In short, the movie was fine, watchable, and very glossy, but a true disappointment compared to the thought-provoking and perspective-altering book.",1418428800,,792,4.746376811594203

6378997,5,B00JLC57OW,"The Fault In Our Stars by John Green portrays the realistic struggle of falling in love at the mere age of eighteen. While most believe it is the common, clich, romantic novel, after reading I have discovered much more lies beneath the surface. Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters are the typical teenagers with extraordinary lives. If you like anything dealing with love, friendship, tragedy, excitement, and surprises around every corner, I suggest this book to you.
It is very well known how difficult any relationship can be, and the author of this book manages to actually put himself into others shoes while writing about the emotion and feeling behind every characters eyes. The descriptions given are incredible and keep me wanting to turn the page without stopping.
Not only is The Fault In Our Stars filled with sophistication, class, elegance, and grace all in the modern era, it also manages to capture the relatable moments in everyones life that i have found myself appreciating. Then again, I was reading this book through an English assignment and found myself being able to appreciate the freedom in just being able to choose the book I wanted to read. But I have no regrets upon my decision.
While reading this book, I was just dealing with the daily struggle of trying to balance my social life with school work while maintaining an appropriate amount of income along with as much sleep needed in order to function properly. The book offers the relatable situations that every teen deals with at one point. How you project yourself, why you were granted with some opportunities, and mainly what is life about? Those are all questions that John Green captures in his brilliant novel.
Looking back, I see this book as a step into the lives of these cancer struck teens. How they dealt with it and what struggles they have gone through to get to this point. I can still picture the scenarios the author was able to paint in my head with his vivid explanations and amazing job at capturing the overall scenes. I don't think Ill ever be able to forget the impact the book has had on me. The words written in this novel have opened my eyes to see things from a whole new perspective. And for that, Ill always have John Green to thank.
If you're anything like me, an excitable, loving, sensitive, relatable teen, you're bound to fall in love with this book the way I have. And if not, Im sure there are still many relatable quotes and images placed in The Fault In Our Stars that everyone will find themselves being able to appreciate in time. I recommend this book to anyone, preferably in the age range of fifteen plus due to the vast vocabulary and difficulty to comprehend the scenarios. I also would like to give this book a five star rating for a multitude of reasons which I have previously listed.",1418169600,,2813,4.684848484848485

6379009,4,B00JLC57OW,"I read the book first and I really liked how Shailene & Ansel brought the characters to life in the movie version.  Their love store was truly beautiful and heart breaking.

However, the movie just glosses over why the book ending is so important to Hazel.  After the character dies, Hazel wants to know if the mom is alright - so she'll know that her mom will be alright when she passes away.  This was a major theme in the book and the movies just dropped the connection.

The book also glosses over Gus struggle with cancer.  I guess the movie focused on the relationship between Hazel and Gus more than the results of cancer - a rather disservice to those suffering with the disease, I think.",1418083200,,696,4.440944881889764

6379042,4,B00JLC57OW,"Watched this movie twice. Once by myself and once with my wife. We both thought it was a very good movie.
We thought the scenes done in Ann Franks house were really good. A voice over the house speaker system reading from Ann's diary was especially meaningful as Hazel Grace struggled to climb the stairs and ladder to Ann's room. The part of the  parents of both Hazel Grace and Gus were, In my opinion, well written and well acted. They were also hero 's in this story, for parents of a child with a devastating disease can only love their child and be there for every crisis. Some how, some how, they they must let them have room to live their own lives.

The relationship with Hazel Grace and Gus grew while she began to come out of her social shell.  Now and then I found it difficult to understand what the actor playing Hazel Grace was saying.

Filming a special wish in Amsterdam allowed for spreading their wings and confronting a author who had meant so much to Hazel Grace when she read his book. He turned out not to be so nice, not taking his own grief so well. I won't spoil the plot any further. However there is a good lesson to be learned there.

As in sickness and well as in health, surprises come. This is not a sugar coated film but a rather honest and meaningful one. Actually much of the movie was fun, it was not all about gloom and doom.",1417824000,2,1362,4.263565891472868

It's purpose of selling me on seeing the movie in it's entirety was a total success. I anticipated watching it with excitement BEFORE seeing the extended preview. Afterwards I knew it needed to be in my video library rather than just a temporary rental.

Ordering it from Amazon was a
no-brainer.  I could see my options all in one place. The options avaliable to me included previously used (and the various conditions available) or brand new in original packaging. I knew my efforts to find the best price/value wouldn't be necessary.  Amazon had done that for me. All I needed to do was determine what condition suited me. I could easily see how soon  it could be shipped.  Obvious to see, thanks to Amazon, the new one  was the better value. It came with free shipping in as little as two days.

I received the item as it was described. It arrived quickly as promised.

The movie was everything I hoped it would be! Immediately after seeing it i knew I'd watch it a second time.  Happy with my purchase and the process, the movie is now a part of my movie library.",1417478400,,1199,4.463302752293578

It's a nice story but we didn't sit around being sad about the inevitability of death, we fought to make ends meet and survive.  Death was something that happened, often.  While tragic, it was something you came to accept and guard for, we didn't have the luxury of sitting around in a big beautiful house crying about things of that sort.

My days of ""identifying myself"" with the young folks have come and gone. But, I remember so vividly what it was like to be in
love for the first time and to feel invincible. So, I did watch the movie partly from the young folks perspective.
When the whole mood of the movie changes ( trying to not give away any of the story ), I switched and began watching it through the parent's eyes. Now, this, became a visceral experience. Not nearly as much fun. Even the two young characters had to ""go down the rabbit hole"" ( so to speak ); In order to have some sort of completion and closure within themselves. Lots of big name actors doing a really good job and two young actors stealing the show! All in all a great movie!",1416614400,,828,4.280254777070064

6379364,4,B00JLC57OW,"Shailene Woodley does an excellent job in the lead role, she certainly looks different to her Divergent character, the only other film of hers I've seen.  The DVD version I watched has an extra showing them cutting off most of her hair for her to become this character, that and the other behind the scenes extras were quite good and worth picking a version that includes extras. The only thing they probably should have done was make her and the other terminally ill people look a bit sicker for want of a better word (more realistic to someone undergoing the treatment would look).  The film itself is a little predictable, but it's a nice journey there.

There was the odd unrealistic scene, (spoilers follow) such as a making out scene in Anne Frank's House, and instead of someone speaking up saying ""Hey you two this a sacred place, that's inappropriate to do here, take it outside, everyone else claps.  Now if all the other people had known the background leading up to this, that the two were dying of cancer you could maybe accept that, but all the other tourists, except the author's assistant know nothing except Hazel struggled to get up the stairs.  Also (and this may well have been played out in the book) it was a bit of a quick jump from both sets of parents not really wanting the other teen around (both are rushed to the hospital at different times and the other is waiting anxiously outside and says the staff won't let them in as they are not family and both times the parent blows them off with a well better go home then), to fighting for them against medical advice to be allowed to go to Amsterdam.  I also didn't get why the author decided to jump on a plane and come to the funeral, it just didn't fit in with his character up to that stage.  I could understand if his assistant made him, or she'd quit her job, but this isn't said.

Overall it's a decent watch, probably needed a bit more from Gus' point of view for you to feel a bit more at the end of the film where similar films would have had you tearing up.",1416009600,,2043,4.386243386243386

When you start a movie out with someone having cancer, you obviously expect them (or someone else) to die. Plus the whole tissue comment already spoiled it for you. So it was a matter of, okay when are they gonna die?  I cried when I watched The Notebook, The Last Song, and A Walk To Remember, but not this. Also, don't use stupid names like Hazel and Augustus. What time period are you wanting us to think this is in?  Seriously. Pick more common names. And what kind of whack job just puts a cigarette to their lips and doesn't smoke it?

But, this movie is 5 STARS definately.  I would have cried even more than I did, had I not read the book first.  I cried so much reading the book I had to put it down and go back the next day, a couple of times.  I read alot, and I must say this is one of my all time favorites!  And the DVD is top notch!

6379633,4,B00JLC57OW,"This movie was pretty good. I'm usually into action/adventure/horror, but my wife wanted some romance and what my wife wants, my wife gets. So here's the 30 second rundown of ""The Fault in Our Stars.""

This movie starts off with us getting to know our protagonist, Hazel Grace, a smoking hot cancer patient who thinks she's not smoking hot because of a thin strip of plastic on her face, think John Hughes syndrome for the millenials. Anyway, Hazel Grace has not had it easy in life and basically spends all day moping around until her parents, who were really looking forward to her dying as a child, forcibly drive her to a support group.

After a few meetings, Hazel, referred to as Hottie McBreathingTube from this point forward, is introduced to a creepy guy who won't stop staring at her. Creepy guy, Augustus, or Gus for short, wins her over by basically growing on her long and slow, like a fungus. Gus also had cancer and had his leg amputated, Lt. Dan-style.

Hottie McBreathing Tube and Lt. Dan Jr. spend some time doing normal teenaged stuff, at which point they share books and decide to stalk the author of Hottie's favorite book down in Amsterdam. They arrange a trip by basically getting a two-fer out of the movie's ""Make a wish"" trope, but Hazel gets sick and is told she can't go. Then told she can. So the duo fly mostly unsupervised to Amsterdam where you're forced to watch an awful ""New to this country"" montage set to ""Boom Clap"" by that annoying band. After a romantic evening paid for by the author of the book, the two set out to meet the author, who turns out to be a REALLLY drunk William Dafoe. See, it turns out that the whole ordeal was set up by William's hot assistant, possibly lover, who looks like the hot red head playing the new Wendy on Wendy's commercials. He basically acts like an existential jerk and makes them both cry. Wendy runs outside to apologize and the group decides that they can lighten the mood by visiting the Anne Frank house. This is a really bad idea, because while hot, Hazel basically has 1/4 of a lung and there aren't any elevators. After climbing through the house Anne Frank built and nearly dying twice, Hazel and Dan Jr. express their love physically, though Hazel has to put the breathing tube back in, but he basks in her hottness for about 30 seconds. *Sidenote* If this movie taught me anything, it's that you can still have terrible debilitating cancer and both be hot and have amazing abs. *End Sidenote*

After that, Lt. Dan Jr. dies. Ya, you heard me. Straight. Up. Dies. You see, they were leading up to Hazel being the super sick one the whole time. Turns out our friend the lieutenant had been hiding the fact that he had super cancer and it basically spread everywhere, but not before Hazel and their blind friend could read him his own eulogy. At the lieutenant's funeral, William shows up again, less Green Goblin, more Finding Nemo. Hottie McHotHot chews him out, only to find out that her boyfriend wrote a really nice letter about her and had Green Goblin deliver it.

Oh and there was something about underage  drinking and stars.

Hope you enjoy the movie!",1415059200,5,3143,4.571936056838366

If you enjoyed the book, I think you'll be happy with the adaption.
Shailene Woodley is suitably jaded and yet vulnerable as Hazel Grace. But Ansel Elgort steals this movie as Augustus Waters.
Charming, witty, urbane, but also completely in love with Hazel Grace and isn't ashamed to admit it. And honest.
It portrays the weary wisdom that children with cancer often seem to have. Been there, done that. Got the t-shirt.

I usually like to read the book before I watch a movie (if it is based off a book), but I didn't get a chance to do that with this one. The previews had me anticipating this coming to rental. I am so glad I chose to rent this movie.

It is an amazing, thought provoking movie that makes you think how precious our lives are, how to make the most of every moment, and to make sure everyone in your life knows just how much you care for them. This movie is a love story; not just in the sense of her relationship with her boyfriend but also with her family and her friends. Life goes by so fast and we so often take it for granted.

6379718,4,B00JLC57OW,"If you choose, you could be snarky about this film. Characters about to die of cancer somehow look better than most of us on our best days, and the selection of (excellent) indie songs used as score gets a bit too constant and insistent on telling us what to feel.

But at it's core this is a good-hearted, wonderfully acted, funny, human and very, very sad film about being adolescent and trying to open your heart to love while facing a life span measured in months, not decades or even years.

Josh Boone does a very nice, subtle job as director, getting nuanced performances from all, and finding visual touches that enhance without being self-conscious. Laura Dern, Sam Trammell, Nat Wolff and Willem Dafoe all provide terrific work in supporting roles. Ansel Elgot takes a role that is much trickier than it looks  as one critic put it he's an actor playing a kid who himself is playing a character - Gus is doing his best to play the brave, cocky optimist, but there's clearly a much more vulnerable young man underneath. Elgot walks that tightrope very well. And Shailene Woodley brings tremendous depth and complexity to Hazel. She takes a character it would be hard not to love, but makes her something much more; a multi faceted, very real human being.

While it has it's occasional Hollywood moments, it's deeply moving and life affirming without denying the suffering, loss and pain, which is all one can really ask of a film about death.",1414368000,2,1451,4.700787401574803

6379789,3,B00JLC57OW,"The fault in our stars tackles the difficult issue of young people (teenagers) dealing with an issue much beyond their years. Cancer.

Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters meet during a support group meeting. Augustus is in remission and Hazel Grace is stable for the time being, despite issues with her lungs. The two start off as friends but the relationship quickly becomes much more as they being experiencing life together and sharing interests. One such interest is the book An Imperial Affection. Hazel and Augustus fall in love with this book and decide they need to know what happens to the characters after it ends. They go on a joint journey to Amsterdam to meet with the author, who ends up being a jerk. They decide to visit the Anne Frank house and explore their albeit temporary freedom in the new city.

Selecting Shailene Woodley as Hazel Grace was the perfect casting job. Unfortunately, they should have reconsidered their selections of Augustus and Peter.

Augustus- I slowly began to accept him in this role as the movie went on, but a lot of the lines seems very rushed and forced. Nothing kills an important, intimate moment quicker than an awkward reading. Two points really stick out in my mind:

1. The picnic- Before Hazel can even chew the first bite of her sandwich, Augustus is quick to ask her if she understands the symbolism of their situation. Some may argue he was so excited that he simply couldn't wait, but it definitely came off as unnatural. Like throwing a baseball and telling the person to catch after it has left your hand. He didn't allow Hazel any time to even consider the various elements of her surroundings. Instead, he quickly revealed his grand plan for the picnic. This was an important point of the movie and should have been slowed down.

2. The dinner at Oranjee- Something about Augustus' delivery of his dialogue felt very wrong. When the two were going back and forth with small chit chat, everything seemed perfectly normal. However, when Augustus starts his rants, it felt very forced and unnatural.

As I alluded to earlier, the other poor casting choice was Peter. I love Willem Dafoe, but in my mind I pictured Peter as an overweight alcoholic with little reason to live. Dafoe does not fit this description at all, even on his worst days. He can play the villain of the piece of course, but was not the ideal candidate by a long shot.

The movie covered the main points of the story, but left out what I felt were tidbits that should have been included.

1. Only really sick kids take the elevator. It is thought of as a step before death to reduce yourself to using the elevator rather than taking the stairs.
2. The drawing on the desk in Holland. You couldn't even see it on the movie!! Why even include it if you don't allow watchers to see it?
3. Augustus' fight with his parents before their trip didn't happen. In fact, a lot of the scenes at Augustus' house were cut out entirely.
4. Listing the swingset on Craig's list didn't happen.
5. This is a small thing, but shows a lack of caring. When the dad picks up Hazel, her mom, and Augustus, you couldn't even read the sign he held up for them. Again, probably not important, but I'm sure it had something creative written on it.

For the reasons above, I would recommend reading the book unless you prefer the watered down version of things. Or simply don't have the time to devote to a book.

 The movie is passable, but doesn't stir up the feelings of the book.",1413936000,,3482,4.581993569131833

6379803,3,B00JLC57OW,"Pros: It's a teen romance. Follows the typical teen romance formula with classic cliche's here and there. Shy girl, charismatic charming guy sweeps her off her feet. He gives her everything, she gives him everything. The twist of course is that these two have some involvement with cancer. Death is right around the corner, you only live once. These two did a lot of living from the moment their story begins, to the moment of it ends. Beautiful story.
--
Cons: This doesn't get a better rating due to the typical formula and the cliche's. The story had elements in it that felt forced, especially from the parents point of view. Those forced elements are things that a teenager may related too in their perspective, which is the primary audience anyway, so it can be forgiven. The story also lacked new, unique, more could have been done which makes it lack that wow factor. You can't remember the character's names the next day. The acting also works against it, look at the difference between William Dafoe's acting and the acting of the main character's father.

You can't just think about ""when i die how many people would care"" because its true it doesn't matter how many people do it matters on the people who where there with you till the every end, and thats what counts. The people around you.. your friends your family.. isn't that enough?

6379855,4,B00JLC57OW,"In the movie Fault In Our Stars, Hazel Woodley) and Gus (Elgort) are two teenagers who face their fight with cancer together after they meet and fall in love at a cancer support group.

When I first started watching this, I was like hey those two actors look familiar, especially since I had recently watched Divergent.  Not being a big book reader (I just don't have the time to get into a novel), I was not very familiar with the story other than what I had seen on the movie trailers but even with that, it looked interested enough to me to watch.  Plus my wife didn't give me the option ;-)...

Both Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort have a definite chemistry in this movie. In fact, Elgort plays the role very well.  The story although at times feels a bit formulaic, it is never the less beautifully written and even amongst the sadness of the tale, has a wit and charm about it throughout that made me smile throughout.  It is a nicely written love story that makes you feel for both characters as they struggle through and in the end will make tears come to your eyes.  Or at least it did me.  I did feel at times though the movie was a bit too long at 2 hours and 6 minutes and tried a bit too hard to pull at you.  Minor though as the story was a good one and both me and the wife enjoyed a lot.  4 stars.",1413676800,,1315,4.141732283464567

6379895,2,B00JLC57OW,"I wanted to like this movie because I loved the book so much, but it just didn't meet my expectations. Unfortunately, John Green's witty metaphors and sarcastic humor that I loved reading just didn't translate that well when spoken out loud. The dialogue between Hazel and Augustus sounded exactly like what it was: scripted. And part of it was because of the not so great casting. Shailene Woodley is not a bad actress, but she didn't play Hazel in this movie. She played an entirely different girl than the one I read about, one who was too giggly, cutesy, and much too open to flirting with Gus from the start to ever be Hazel Grace Lancaster. Ansel Elgort was even worse. He took a smart, charming, infectiously positive and honest boy and turned him into a dorky, obnoxious, cocky douchebag. There was no chemistry between Woodley and Elgort. I bawled at the end of the book and didn't shed a single tear throughout this entire movie. Nat Wolff was the best part, and he didn't get nearly enough screentime. Perhaps if I hadn't read the book I would've liked this movie. But I did read the book. And I didn't like the movie.",1413590400,3,1129,4.566502463054187

6379985,4,B00JLC57OW,"Leaving the parking-lot last night after picking up The Fault in Our Stars from Redbox, my wife looks at me and says, I don't want to be depressed tonight.  I understand the idea of not wanting to be depressed, but I just spent the money on a one day rental and you KNEW what movie we were getting so why are you telling me this now?  She says Im just warning you now, I may have to make fun of this movie to spare myself depression and I shrugged and said well, you know that Woodley forages for food and doesnt wear deodorant and eats chalk or soap or rocks or something like that and so I figured we were good; that we were safe.  Besides, my wife never cries.  The long running joke in our family is that Im the wife since Im the one who cries at every movie.  In fact, I refuse to sit next to my wife whenever we watch anything that has a reputation for making someone cry, because shes always stone faced and ridicules me later for uncontrollable sobbing.

We got home, put kids to bed and settled into our respective places in the living room.  The movie started, the movie ended, and not a word was said by either of us throughout the entire film.  When it was over, my wife stood up, said I don't ever want to talk about that movie again and walked upstairs to our bedroom.

She had reached her cinematic breaking point.

The funny thing about kids is that they really mess you up.  They change everything about your emotional makeup.  One day nothing bothers you and the next every little thing makes you well with tears.  Its not always sadness.  It can be overwhelming happiness, but regardless, something about being a parent just changes you.  A film like The Fault in Our Stars, for a parent, is one of the hardest things to sit through, because it challenges everything you know about being a parent, everything you instinctively feel.  My children are my world, and the very idea of losing one of them, whether it be to cancer or something else entirely, nearly reduces me to a walking coma.  Watching this movie, I felt the weight of Augustuss words, where he says (in voiceover) I willed myself to imagine a world without us and what a worthless world that would be, and he is so right.

You watch this film and you want to reach out and hold and comfort and fix and, as the film so clearly points out, you cant always do that.

For me, The Fault in Our Stars was misery porn, and I honestly cant stomach why so many tote this as one of their favorite movies ever.  Instagram lights up with teenage acquaintance after teenage acquaintance dedicating their evenings to a box of tissues and this movie and Im sitting there shaking my head now because Ive seen it and they have no idea.  These teenagers look at this film about star crossed lovers and such undying emotion and such sweet chemistry and they think if only I could find a love as deep and yet they don't see WHY this movie is so difficult, why it is so painful because they have no idea what its like to love someone that deeply.  They focus on the puppydog aspect of this love story, but the real love story here is in the loss that these kids have no idea about.  Give them ten years and a baby and theyll never want to watch this movie again; ever.

And Im not trying to knock the film at all, because despite the flaws (and there are flaws), it is a beautifully composed film and one that I truly liked; but I could never watch this again, and I fear that the abandon with which these flocks of teens are throwing their love towards it is misplaced because they simply lack the life experience to fully understand this movie.

The Fault in Our Stars tells a tragic love story, one of a young girl named Hazel who is dying of cancer who falls in love with a young boy named Augustus who is also dying of cancer.  They have come to terms with their illness and their life course, but they feed off each other in order to move forward, embracing their lives the best they can.  In the process, their families are trying to prepare themselves, live a normal life but a cautious and attentive one, and this process leaves scars on Hazel, who is consumed with the wonderment of what life will be like for her loved ones after she is gone.  She is filled with an internal guilt over leaving her family behind and is plagued by a memory of when she was thirteen, watching her mother cry at her side while in the hospital.  The weight of her own inevitability is crushing down on Hazel, but Augustus gives her room to breathe.

The film opens with the pretense that this will be that honest portrayal of a life in decay; that it will avoid the stereotypical Hollywood candy coating, but it is in this statement that the film finds its biggest flaw.  This is one of those strange films that singlehandedly avoids and embraces the very same clichs.  It handles the morose topic and character development with such sophisticated nonchalance and naturalism and yet it turns around and exploits it for cheap tears.  Scenes like the pre-funeral or the visit to the Anne Frank house or that ill constructed final voiceover feel so manipulative and unnecessary when the remainder of the film was SO EFFECTIVE already.

We didn't need to be told to cry; we were already doing it.

But, despite these moments of manipulation, The Fault in Our Stars succeeds mostly because the film is anchored by two tremendous performances.  Both Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort are so natural, so complex and so devoted to these characters that you feel them reach right into your heart.  Their chemistry is uncanny, and their performances so rich with honesty and naturalism that I feel as though they will forever be in my heart because of this.  Not a false note, not ONE.  I believed them every single step of the way.  Laura Dern gives a heartbreaking performance as Hazels mother, and Nat Wolff offers some nicely played comedic support.  I felt that Willem Dafoes character was a misstep for the film, and that Sam Trammells hushed voice gave him a creepy air that made me uncomfortable (and, for the father or a cancer patient, he had no depth), but they aren't really important here.

Its not perfect, and its crushing emotionally, but I cant say that The Fault in Our Stars is a bad movie.  Its hard to judge this movie.  I fail to understand why anyone wants to be entertained by dying children, but I cant deny that the film packs a powerful punch.  I just don't think I want to be punched like this again.",1413331200,,6471,4.423628691983122

6379998,5,B00JLC57OW,"This movie was, when it came out, a surprisingly huge hit.  Surprisingly because it is about young people with cancer.  But it is an astonishingly direct and beautiful picture.  The chemistry between to two stars is so believable that you cherish each scene they do. The total build is flawless.  Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort are quite believable as the young teens.  Sheilene carries much of the film with nary a false step.  Ansel is always impish, his love for Grace (Shailene) shining through so that, when he confesses his is full of cancer and not in remission at all, his demeanor changes to tearful results.  This picture is very sad, but it is never depressing. Laura Dern and Nat Trammel are Grace's parents and most believable.  Have a box of tissues handy, however, because the end comes with crushing power.  The sadness does not come because of the progress of cancer but because the lives can't go on to the joyous conclusion they deserve.  The tie-in with Anne Frank is important, for she too was trapped in an unwinnable situation, unable to let her emotions emerge.",1413331200,,1088,4.770053475935829

6380057,5,B00JLC57OW,"..or thats what I did anyway. But if you are wondering .. there are a zillion other romantic movies built along the same lines (P.S. I love you, Autumn in NewYork..etc etc ...) you are most definitey right. But this movie (book) does so much more... there is so much of drama and the brutality of truth that you almost forget about the romance. Not that it has got any surprises. I pretty much figured out what was going to happen within the first 30 mins or so but still kept on watching...

The book has terrific oneliners and full of funny and sarcastic throws that adds a zing in the mix. But speakin for myself I completely fell in love with the math. Hazel, I am guessing is the bigger infinity and Gus (her lover) was the slightly smaller infinity, and between them they had this tiny little infinity which just went on forever. Its not hard to feel pity for Peter Van Hauten, but if I was intelligent I woud say he was Cancer himself. But I am happy feeling angry at him.

The movie however .. although it followed the book as close as possible (really close) got a whole new character .. thanks a lot to Shailene Woodley. She is impeccable. But the drama was so dramatic ... one scene .. I would humbly say reminded me of the you-tubed version of Charlie Chaplins Great Dictator speech .. the one with the Inception soundtrack etc..it felt that good. The movie literally comes out of the screen and grabs you by the collar and says ..Celebrate life you idiots.

I felt the movie(not the book) was incomplete. What happens to Hazel? I see a funeral...everyone leaves .. save for Peter Van Houten .. drunk .. sad .. raising his flask....(aaahh don't we like a good tragedy )

I also see life.. a full remission ...  the American girl with the Dutch Tulip Man (a really old and really sober Tulip man ) ..and maybe Sissyphus too :)",1412985600,8,1837,4.391176470588236

6380114,4,B00JLC57OW,"The Fault in Our Stars is the film based on the wildly successful young adult novel by John Green. In an interview, Green said in writing the book that he wanted to create a moving and realistic portrait of what its like to be young and in love and sick. Now if that doesnt sound interesting, you're probably not a 15-year-old girl. Nonetheless, Josh Boone directs a film that achieves Greens goal by telling a humanizing story about very adult situations impacting some very young people.
The Fault in Our Stars is the story of seventeen-year-old Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and eighteen-year-old Augustus (Ansel Elgort). Hazel lives with stage IV Thyroid cancer with metastasis forming in her lungs causing her to be perpetually connected to an oxygen tank. Augustus is recovering from a bout with osteosarcoma that took one of his legs. Hazel nearly died from complications of her cancer when she was thirteen, but favorable results from an experimental drug called Philanxiphor have slowed the growth of her cancer. Hazel and Augustus form an immediate bond when they meet in a cancer support group, and the film basically documents their growing relationship as it buds into romance.
As with any romantic film, much of its success relies on the chemistry between the stars, and Woodley and Elgort have it. Woodley practically makes me forget about her dull and droning performance in Divergent and instead makes me recall a much better film of hers, The Spectacular Now. She plays Hazel with the intelligence, dignity, and realism that her character deserves. Elgort brings the extreme likability of Augustus off the page and to life. Augustuss goal is to be remembered, to seize the day and do remarkable things. Greens book and Boones film do a nice job of showing an audience who is likely on the young side that being a good person is the best way to make this happen.
Theres no getting around this, The Fault in Our Stars is sad. The reason that makes it worth the emotional struggle is that the story is so human. That is not to say that the film does not pander for tears. On occasion, it does, but the films love, life, and spirit of humanity far outweigh its struggles, darkness, and frailty of life.
While the film does have young protagonists and is told chiefly through their eyes, there is a sphere of adult perspective from both Hazels and Augustuss parents. Hazels mother (Laura Dern) is developed well in the film, and in some of the films happiest moments, Dern is responsible for the audiences biggest smiles.
The Fault in Our Stars is a strongly accurate adaptation of Greens novel. It is also a beautiful little film about young love under bleak circumstances. There is no doubt you know what you are getting into before buying a ticket for this film, but in the words of the films strangest character Peter Van Houten (Willem Defoe), Thats the thing about pain, it demands to be felt.

The endless voice over will clog your brain with faux deep thoughts and cause you to lose 12 IQ points in the 90 minutes you're exposed --- oh, I could go on and on... Yes, I will go on: this movie manages to offend by having a one of Hollywood's tritest gimmicks, a ""slow clap"" scene, in the Anne Frank house! If that doesn't make you think twice about this movie, you're going to love it.

6380146,4,B00JLC57OW,"There comes a time when your girlfriend asks you to watch a movie and you've seen the preview of said picture and you are reluctant to proceed.  Well, this happened and I wasn't at all willing to participate in the viewing of The Fault In Our Stars, not one little bit.  It looked way to depressing. In the end, for love and/or simple caving to the insistence, I relented.  A movie about kids with terminal cancer? Why was I watching this? To appease the gods? To ensure that I wasn't murdered in my sleep? Perhaps a little of both.  Anyway...

The plot is pretty basic.

16 year old girl  Hazel Grace Lancaster has terminal cancer, while attending a support group meeting she meets 18 year old boy Augustus Waters, who had his bout with cancer and survived, losing part of his leg in the process.  Hazel has, apparently, come to terms with her imminent  demise, yet her parents have not.  She refuses to get romantically involved with Gus, knowing that the affair will only end in sorrow when she dies.

This movie is depressing beyond belief.  It is also charming and clever and so heart-felt that if you aren't reaching for a Kleenex at any number of scenes, then you have absolutely no human emotional characteristics at all and you should immediately seek serious psychiatric treatment before it's too late.  The Fault In My Stars is not going to be for everyone. I don't think I will ever have the guts to watch it again.  Having dealt with friends and family members who succumbed to cancer, it is was too personal.  Watching parents have to deal with the unimaginable torment of watching their children suffer and eventually die makes my emotions run the gamut from terror to anger to a sadness so complete it scarred my soul.  Not for the meek.  I did not read the book.  I don't think I would want to. Overall, amazing use of emotions, finding cheer in small victories.  The film makes you understand that although some people have a short amount of time to live, they may find solace in sharing moments that really count.  Love is cruel and often painful when dealing with terminal illness, but it is necessary. Worth the watch.  Worth the tears.

It doesn't take into account that today's 18 year old narcissists don't give a crap about pretty much anything that's not solipsistically focused on themselves.  As such, the movie - and the story - require a huge, huge suspension of disbelief that is just not possible given that particular generation's bloated sense of self regard and absolute disregard for anything but themselves.  Gave it a 3 however for some really fantastic performances that offer a glimmer of hope for what has been called the worst generation ever.

6380196,5,B00JLC57OW,"I was traveling down to florida, a long 12 hour journey ahead of me, I found myself with a perfect opportunity to listen to my audio book of The Fault in Our Stars. I had heard so many raves about TFIOS, and that even though it was in a genre I normally don't read, I was feeling very tempted to try it out.... I AM SO GLAD I DID.  I loved it so much I didn't want my trip to end, I just wanted to continuously drive until it was done.

I don't want to give away too much of the story because I was pleasantly surprised that the plot was still very much a surprise to me. Even though everyone talks about this book and there are endless movie trailers for TFIOS, I was very surprised that they did not give away the plot for the book. TFIOS follows Hazel, as a young girl suffering from lung cancer, and Hazel meets Augustus at a group meeting.  TFIOS follows these two as they battle cancer, friendship, and living each day like it might be your last.

The situations that Hazel and Gus deal with, no matter how difficult, are met with humor, sarcasm and wit. They both had a way of handling their hard situations with words that was just... perfect! I personally don't have the words to describe it, but I have no doubt that Hazel and Gus would !

About the Audio Book.
I don't have too much experience with listening to audio books. I have listened to a few, however this was hands down the BEST AUDIO BOOK I HAVE EVER READ LISTENED TO. I didn't think it made a difference on who the audio book was read by, I was wrong! TFIOS was read by Kate Rudd and it was extremely easy to listen to. I felt like she embodied the spirit of Hazel and read every line with as much wit and sarcasm that each line deserved. I listened to this audiobook as easily as I could watch a movie. I laughed, I cried, It was an amazing experience and I highly recommend this audiobook, and any audiobooks that Kate Rudd read whole heartedly.",1412294400,,1919,4.1897018970189706

6380214,3,B00JLC57OW,"My husband and I both decided that the actors all do a great job at being sad. Some spots can choke you up, but for the most part, the only way that would make the teen actors, especially Gus, believable is if they all played theater/drama students. Otherwise, it all feels rather forced. Every moment, Gus must act as if he were on a Broadway show. Some people might be okay with that, but I was hoping for more of a Ferris Bueller vibe for Gus.

Also, I'm kind of tired of watching movies with rich teens.

I thought the movie was a fairly accurate adaption of the book, so if you are looking for a movie that is accurate to the source material, this is it.",1412208000,,659,4.181102362204724

If you read the book, you almost feel as if you are finally meeting these characters, no these friends, and are going on this journey all over again with them. Be aware, you will need tissues, and to make sure you don't yell out while watching as if you are there. It could happen. It is a heartwarming movie, and a massive tear jerker, but I promise, best film you will have ever saw. You become so invested in the people and that's why you cry and don't even know it. You let them in and they grab you. Not a bad soundtrack either.

Not sure what happened, but we did not expect this from a new release.
Regarding the story line:  It was predictably bittersweet.  You know before you view, what it is about.  There were many aspects of the unfolding story that were too far fetched.  Its worth renting to hear some of the words of wisdom presented by teens, who were wise beyond their years.. but make sure you are not expecting an uplifting movie, to cheer you up.",1412121600,,710,4.457364341085271

For the average fan and moviegoer, any version of TFiOS will delight, if you appreciate the subject matter.

6380387,2,B00JLC57OW,"I would have given this film one star except Shailene Woodley is an excellent actress. I was first very impressed with her performance in The Descendants. But then I was simply blown away by her performance in Spectacular Now, which was a fantastic film. So when I saw this movie got over 8 stars on imdb, I had high hopes. Those hopes were quickly dashed.

This film is one long clich. Every scene you feel like you've seen 100 times before. And except for Woodley (who they must have paid boat loads of money) the cast was not good. Woodley's parents were so miscast, I felt like they must have walked out into the hallway and grabbed the first male and female actor to walk by. Contrast this to the relationship between Miles Teller (son) and Jennifer Jason Leigh (mom) in Spectacular Now which was an amazing look at a mother-son relationship. Woodley's parents were more like placeholders to deliver the proper clich at the proper moment.

And the fact that Woodley's character seemed to be near death in every other scene just telegraphed the fact that it was the boy who would be the one to die. I knew nothing of this story, but that was so obvious to me almost from the first scene. And OMG, the slow clap after their first kiss! That was so cheesy I cannot find the right words to describe it.

I will continue to be a fan of Shailene Woodley. But in the long- term, this film will be one she would like to forget.",1411689600,3,1424,4.406844106463878

6380398,4,B00JLC57OW,"I read the book a few months before seeing the movie. I rated the book 4 stars as well by the way. This movie is very well made, especially considering that there are no big name actors in it (no offense to the actors in this movie, they did a really great job). The casting was spot on. Since I read the book first I was curious to see what actors they chose to play these roles and I think they nailed it. The reason why I am not giving the move 5 stars is because, just like the book, the movie is too unrealistic for me. What I mean by that is that too many things happen too perfectly in order to enhance the plot or make things too dramatic. Its a really emotional movie and there are so many sad scenes throughout the movie that at times it feels a bit overdone. The writing is good, just like book. Like any other book that was made into a movie, the book is better and more enjoyable, but in this case its only slightly better. They really did a good job translating the book into a movie. Not a lot is lost (it was a short book, so that makes sense) and you get the full story in the movie.
All in all, this is a good movie that is recommended whether you read the book or not. If you haven't read the book and are thinking about reading it, I would read the book first. The acting is really great and the casting is spot on. The story flows well but feels very ""teenager-ish"" which is a bit of shame because I think the movie could have been a lot better if it was more adult.",1411603200,,1487,3.9932885906040267

Ansel Elgort also does good job as the fated boyfriend.  Great to see Laura Dern again, who did great job playing Ms. Woodley's mother.  Only miscasting, in my opinion, was the  Van Houten character who was played by William Defoe, otherwise a great actor, but not here playing the acerbic, caustic  alcoholic  part, which was so well developed in book.  John Goodman would've been better choice. Tight script with no wasted efforts.

6380442,2,B00JLC57OW,"I really, really, really wanted to like this movie mainly because I really enjoyed the book.  That being said, I was disappointed with the movie adaptation for a number of reasons.  There was too much information left out of the movie from the book.  I understand that the majority of movies leave out information from the books they are adapted from, but in this case leaving out the information does this movie an injustice.  I found it difficult to connect with the characters without this information.  The acting by Woodley and Elgort just wasn't believable.  There was no chemistry between these two at all.  I found it difficult to believe that they were friends let alone boyfriend and girlfriend.  In the book, Gus comes across as a very light hearted and funny person.  Elgort seems to be forcing the dialogue as if he was bored.  Scenes that were so powerful in the book just didn't emit the same power in the movie.  The scene where they egg Monica's car is rather humorous in text, but blah in the movie.  Another example of this is the seen with the writer and Hazel in the car, the movie rendition just couldn't pull off the emotion that it needed to.  I wish they had left Gus' eulogy scene as it was in the book.  The effect was lost by leaving out Van Houten's reaction to what Gus had written.  I don't even know where to start with how Isaac was depicted in the movie.  This was just bad in every aspect.  There are some good aspects of the movie.  Gus' death is handled rather well.  Woodley did an excellant job in this scene.  Viewers are able to feel the sadness of Hazel.  Hazel's eulogy of Gus was very touching.  It did bring tears to my eyes.  If you haven't read the book, you will most likely really enjoy this film, but if you've read the book, you might want to skip it.",1411430400,3,1802,4.410334346504559

6380456,5,B00JLC57OW,"FAULT IN OUR STARS is a quite remarkable film, if only for the stunning performances of Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort in the leading roles as two teenagers suffering from terminal cancer.  There might have been a temptation to sentimentalize this story in the manner of LOVE STORY (1972), but director Josh Boone manages to create instead a story of remarkable poignancy while remaining aware of just how destructive the awareness that one has cancer can be.

It's often difficult to explain to non-sufferers the effects of cancer, not only physically but emotionally.  Despite the well-meaning intentions of her parents (Laura Dern, Sam Trammell), Hazel (Woodley) cannot really communicate her true feelings to them.  She is not simply an ""Ugly Duckling"" whose illness renders her somehow 'different' from her classmates; she is a living, breathing person who wants to be regarded just like anyone else.  The fact that she has an illness is irrelevant; in the limited time she has available, she wants to live life to the full.  This is precisely what Gus (Elgort) and fellow cancer-sufferer Isaac (Nat Wolff) understand, and hence the three of them become almost inseparable.  When Hazel and Gus are together, they not only gain strength from one another but learn how to treat the world on their own terms, and not necessarily listen to their parents.  Boone's handling of these sequences is quite brilliant, especially the sequence where the two teenagers hug and kiss in bed.

In the end, however, the realities of cancer leads to a sad ending; but is it really 'sad'?  According to a non-cancer suffer, it might be considered as such, but to Hazel it represents something else, something intangible.  She might experience severe emotional distress, but that experience gives her a renewed faith in life.  Cancer requires people to rethink their lives and try to approach each day in different ways, to reconstruct themselves and to become more mindful of the world around them.  This is what Hazel manages to do, which is why we feel so supportive of her.

FAULT IN OUR STARS is perhaps the first movie I have seen to approach the experience of cancer in a way that non-cancer suffers might understand.  It is a groundbreaking piece; if it could be shown to anyone and everyone who has encountered the disease, it might change their lives for the better.",1411430400,,2364,4.949367088607595

The two fall in love over literature and the wonder of finding their favorite author in Amsterdam. While in Amsterdam Hazel learns the worst about Augustus, which is that his battle with cancer is not over, but just beginning. This book while a thrilling read, it doesnt seem believable because the elements surrounding the characters are far beyond their years. They travel across continents and speak with words most adults would not use and lastly, have such a desire to understand eternity and the meaning of the universe. Once you are past the disbelief of the characters is when the heavy impact of the story shines through. The themes in the book force readers to their emotional edge as they stretch between life, love, and finality of death. I would definitely recommend this book.",1411344000,,949,4.828220858895706

6380538,3,B00JLC57OW,"This movie is extremely well-acted. I agree that Shailene Woodley's in the running for an Oscar. It's well-done from a technical standpoint as well.

It's just not that enjoyable to watch. The screenplay's often immature or too clich for a film trying to be more artsy and unconventional. Note that I haven't read the book on which the movie's based and so can't speak to whether that's the fault of the original author or the film's direction.

Some scenes were so unrealistic as to be laughable, such as the applause in the Anne Frank house, which really took away from the emotional atmosphere the film was trying to convey. Other elements, like how the male lead carries an unlit cigarette in his mouth as some kind of a statement, just seemed juvenile. (I remember thinking, ""Wow, that's so what I would have done in high school to try to look cool."" What's compelling about Gus is that he's genuine and secure in himself and doesn't ""try to look"".)

What was most lacking was the story arc. There's little internal conflict. There are several interesting conflicts that are touched upon briefly but then left without any depth -- how Hazel's health affects her parents, Isaac's relationship with his girlfriend, Hazel not wanting to hurt Gus, Hazel having to be hospitalized briefly. In general the storyline is just following a sequence of events. There's no tension, aside from the possibility of Hazel dying which the viewer can be fairly confident won't happen since it would end the film. (Of course, if this was happening in reality a relatively tension-free life would be a wonderful thing, but it doesn't make for a very interesting movie.)

(Spoilers) Even when Gus's health goes downhill his death just seems inevitable, and while all the characters are sad it doesn't generate internal conflict. I think the most compelling scenes in the whole movie were Gus at the gas station, and William Dafoe's character's last appearance, both of which were pretty brief.

Maybe the director and writers were trying to balance making compelling movie and staying true to the book's storyline, when they could really successfully only do one or the other. I don't know since, again, I haven't read the book.

I find no fault in the stars (the actors). The film's premise is interesting, it's a beautiful film to look at, and it does make for a good tear-jerker-chick-flick-first-date kind of experience. But so do 'A Walk to Remember' and 'The Notebook', which provide a much more complete and dynamic story arc than this.",1411257600,13,2527,4.892523364485982

Ugly yet beautiful, harsh yet tender. I know that sounds crazy but it's true and this is why I loved it. It was real yet had the essence of a fairy tale. I cried, smiled, laughed and I felt so much emotion- it was a deep movie. Two stand out scenes (SPOILER IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED IT SO STOP HERE IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT) The end when they showed that he snuck into her hospital room when she was sick and they read his letter and showed the flashbacks- that touched me. 2nd stand out scene the way he looked when she read his eulogy- so well acted and touching.

6380546,5,B00JLC57OW,"I've read a lot of books, but this one is one of my top favorites. It's a touching story about a touchy subject. The book shows that true love is blind. It doesn't see illness or ugliness, even in such young people. It takes you deep into it's clutches and doesn't release you until you've finished the book. It kept me interested from the first few pages. Very heartwarming, clean, love story with moments of tears. It shows what love really is, loving someone for their imperfection and not giving up on them. I love that John Green wrote about people being sick, but can still love and live each day like it's your last. Even though I love Hazel, it was Augustus who stole my attention. Even though it was fictional, he demanded my emotion and I gave it to him. The book makes you laugh and cry at the same time. You go through every emotion reading it, but I promise that it will be worth reading. John Green has a very neat way in his writing and you definitely notice it while you read this book. I personally can relate to the book because I know someone with cancer. It made me realize a lot, but even if you can't relate to the book, it's still enjoyable to read. I give it five stars! Even if you don't enjoy reading, you would love the book and never want to put it down. I believe this book allowed a measure if closure to be had those who died too young, but lived so fiercely.

6380595,5,B00JLC57OW,"When a well-loved book is adapted as a movie I always wonder if the film can live up to my expectations.  In this case, it's John Green's fabulous book, The Fault in Our Stars. I didn't get to the theatres to see it, so I happily sat down with the newly released The Fault in Our Stars Little Infinites Blu-ray.

 Director Josh Boone's vision of the book was excellent! For those of you unaware of either book or movie (and how can that be!) The Fault in Our stars is the love story of Hazel and Augustus - who meet at a teen cancer group. Actors Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort both did an amazing job bringing these characters to the screen. Supporting actors Laura Dern and Sam Trammel also embodied the mental images I had created for Hazel's parents. Woodley and Elgort nail the sarcastic dialogue, the poignant scenes and the 'get the tissue box moments' (seriously you're going to want to have that handy) and made me fall in love all over again with this story.

 There are so many great scenes and lines from the book that stuck in my head as I was reading and I wondered if they would appear in the movie. They did - including my personal favourite - ""Some infinities are bigger than other infinities."" This Blu-ray edition is actually called the Little Infinities Extended Edition (and comes with a limited edition little infinities bracelet) The Fault in Our Stars tackles a serious topic with humour, grace, wit and so much emotion. It's impossible not to love the story.

 Although I loved getting lost in watching the movie, I was also eager to see the additional features included - an extended version, deleted scenes (including a cameo cut from John Green), features on the cast, the process of taking a book to a movie and many more.

 Is it a movie I would watch again? Absolutely. Definitely recommended to movie and book lovers - one of the best book to film adaptions I've seen.",1411084800,,1903,4.54093567251462

6380603,4,B00JLC57OW,"I did like it, but I felt that it was alittle bit boring in the beginning. I did fine myself crying when he told her that he was dying. I had a hard time with the boy. He didn't really make me fine that he was dying. I also would of liked for Shailene to shed a few tears at the funeral. I felt the movie was good, but not awesome. There was a problem with the movie and that was that almost at the end the movie stopped and then started all over again.",1410998400,,453,3.778947368421053

6380605,4,B00JLC57OW,"This review is for the Little Infinities Edition.
First off, if you love the movie and are a fan to begin with I don't think you'll be  disappointed. The cover sleeve/cover looked really pretty. There is one regular dvd disc and one blu ray disc, with each of them including both the theatrical and extended versions of the film. Inside also includes a limited edition of a Fault in Our Stars bracelet. I personally don't like the bracelet too much but it is a decent souvenir. The bracelet includes the ""Okay"" and a few other quotes along with the year 2014  shown on it, which is a nice touch. My only little complaint is that if you want to see Deleted Scenes and a few other things, you would have to view them on the blu ray disc as these features aren't included on the regular dvd disc. This could be a minor issue for those who don't have a blu ray player. Oh, and there's also a paper with a redeemable code to put on your computer or any other device. So the description is accurate. Other than that, I'm happy that it is finally on my dvd collection!",1410998400,2,1061,4.3

6380617,5,B00JLC57OW,"This movie is one of the best adaptations of a book! The characters are exactly as they are written in the book, and the casting is phenomenal. With as cheesy as some of the characters are in the movie, they are in the book and you're meant to feel embarrassed for them! I love how it feels like I'm reading the book over again when I watch this. I cry just as hard as I did when I read the story on paper, as I do watching it on screen. John Green'screen story has taken us by storm and I am proud to say I am a Nerdfighter!!! For all of those who know, DFTBA!!

Yes, it was sad, any young love cut short is sad, but this was different. There was so much thought and emotion that was eloquently played. They had their 'ok'.

6380662,1,B00JLC57OW,"I saw all those positive reviews and felt compelled to interject a dose of reality here. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am not a huge fan of romances to begin with but even so, this one came just short of making me hurl. Maybe if you are 12 and still believe in Barbie & Ken's magic  you might think this is awesome (but shouldn't be watching it anyway because the climax of the movie is two underage teens having sex) but the whole thing was so over-the-top gushy and unrealistic that I and the other mom had to pull our 14 yr old daughters' aside to let them know that this is NOT the way things happen. Dad would never stand at an airport waiting expectantly with a gushy welcome back sign as you and mom return from a weekend jaunt unless he had been abducted by aliens or had burned down the house and wanted to ease into his excuse with artificial pleasantries. Add to this the fact that any guy who acts soooooooo eager to please like the love-interest in this movie is a CREEP and/or a PEDOPHILE and you should RUN away from him as quickly as possible. The weirdo author that screams and tells them off suddenly flies across the ocean because he received another letter (suddenly he read this one but ignores and despises all the other ones??) It doesn't make any sense. There was not an ounce of realism at least as far as the males in the movie are concerned. It was so unconvincing that I couldn't even get into the characters and just wanted one of them to go ahead and drop off so this painful movie could end and I could go home.",1410566400,13,1565,4.234113712374582

My mom and I went to see this movie together, me having read the book over a dozen times and my mother only knowing it was a movie about cancer. Being a cancer survivor myself, this book hit me in all the tender-hearted right places. The movie was everything and more that I could have ever wanted. My mom fell in love with it the moment it began. I didn't last the first ten minutes before I was a sobbing mess and my mom followed shortly after. Like Hazel with An Imperial Affliction, TFIOS is my be-all-end-all book and now it is my be-all-end-all movie.

6380688,5,B00JLC57OW,"Easily one of the best movie about sick people. Having grown up in various medical settings, I felt that Hazel and Gus had very believable attitudes about illness and about how to live their lives. Yes, there are extreme up and downs. It is easy to see the person with an illness as brave fighter and role model. But few get to see the lows that a person can go through. I worked at a children's hospital one time and people ask me if that was depressing. I always say no, because there is so much hope even with all the sickness. That is how I feel the movie protrays this area of human experience.",1410393600,,599,4.217391304347826

Only thing I agree with on some reviews is I think it is just unfortunate casting that the guy that plays Gus is her boyfriend in this movie and brother in Divergent. If you've seen both it is a bit odd but I think just bad timing for the releases. You get over it once you get swept up in the movie.,1409875200,,366,4.027397260273973

6380773,5,B00JLC57OW,"For those of you who have not read the book, the storyline focuses on two teenagers Augustus and Hazel who meet at a cancer support group.  From at first glance you can feel the chemistry, they are drawn together but not just because they have cancer, but by love and all they want to experience together.  The emotional journey they embark on, has you hooked.  You will cry, laugh and wish for an alternate ending, but all of us book nerds know how it ends.

 As with all books turned into movies, you will notice some subtle differences in The Fault in Our Stars, the movie omits Hazel's best friend (Kaitlyn), so Hazel appears to be a loner, but it works.  Another character omitted was Gus' former girlfriend Caroline who died of cancer.  There were a few other smaller differences throughout the movie, but the biggest difference for me was at the end, when Hazel searches everywhere for that ""letter"" Gus wrote for her, that is portrayed differently in the movie, it is not as frantic, emotional, gut wrenching as the book.

The acting was superb, Woodley and Elgort portrayed the characters exactly as I imagined.  Laura Dern nailed Hazel's mom!  I was also shocked that William Defoe was cast as  Van Houten, I was expecting an older cantankerous character.  I truly loved this film, even once I was done watching it, I wanted more.  I will be watching this film over and over again.

Looking for some girl time this weekend, I would suggest experiencing The Fault in Our Stars!  A great book turned into a movie is always a safe bet and good time.  A great way to stay connected with the characters we fell in love with on paper, now to only fall in love again on the big screen!

I must admit that I didn't expect such a spectacular performance from two actors that I had really never even heard of before, but I would recommend that anyone and everyone watch it. This movie brings laughs, tears, life lessons, and inspiration that no matter how tough it gets, just hold your head up high and roll with the punches. I can't wait to read the book (because I know the movie can't fit in everything from the book). I have watched this movie over and over already, and it has quickly become my favorite to watch. I suggest it to anyone, but be prepared for the tears.",1409788800,,611,4.368421052631579
6380780,4,B00JLC57OW,"""The Fault in Our Stars"" was a very poignant story about young love and the impact of cancer on young lives.  As a reader, you will feel the pain and suffering and the love between the main characters.  The author chronicles the relationship of Gus and Hazel who meet at a cancer kids support group.  In the book's dialogue between Gus and Hazel, they are just regular teens cracking jokes and making fun of themselves, laughing about their shared experiences with cancer treatments and playing video games.  The pace of the story seems spontaneous and genuine as it brings the friendship of Gus and Hazel into a love story.  ""Fault in our Stars"" has many other secondary stories including Hazel's fixation with her favorite author who writes a book without and ending and their mutual friend, Isaac from the cancer group who loses his vision to cancer.  It honestly portrays the relationship of Gus and Hazel with their respective parents who struggle with the reality of having kids who are so sick.  I have read other novels about cancer victims but ""Fault in Our Stars"" is the first book about cancer which I have read that honestly portrays the everyday suffering of kids with cancer patients and their outlook on living and dying.  In this book, the reader knows that Hazel and Gus will succumb to their cancer  and never enjoy the love that they have discovered.  It is sad but honest in its depiction of Gus and Hazel's unique insights about being terminally ill.",1409788800,2,1471,4.733333333333333

The actors playing Peter Van Houten and Patrick were terrific,  Augustus looks as healthy at death's door than he did in the beginning of the film.  The film lacked the emotional punch of the book and I cannot understand for the life of me why anyone would cry over this.  Of course I am in a differrent demographic: 58 years old and male.

6380807,5,B00JLC57OW,"""The Fault in Our Stars"" is movie adaptation of the beautiful book with the same title, written by the brilliant Mr. John Green. In my opinion, this movie more than does justice to Green's story. It manages to keep the essence of the story intact, doing so in a way where too many other movies-based-on-books have fallen short. In general, the film is wonderfully done. I am far from what you can call an expert when it comes to movies, but I can promise you this one is worth watching. You will be hooked from the first few minutes and will watch experience a rollercoaster of emotions, on which you will hang on to eagerly until the end You will laugh, and sigh, just as surely as you will cry.

The chemistry between these young actors (Elgor & Woodley) was phenomenal. The supporting cast were terrific. In addition the movie is well scripted & every scene in the movie seems to be super charged. This flick was an absolute emotional roller coaster (funny, sad, uplifting, tender & sweet). Though the film does live up to it's reputation as a major ""tearjerker"", it provides much more as a sweet & tender journey you won't soon forget.  Terrific movie!! Don't miss it!!",1406764800,3,587,4.86
6380913,1,B00JLC57OW,"One of the most vexing frustrations of watching ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is the degree to which Josh Boone and his production team attempt to manipulate the audience with an excessively maudlin story that is utterly shallow from beginning to end. The positive reception that the film has received from average moviegoers seems reflective of the fact that the film is effectively a cinematic carbon copy of John Green's best-selling novel. Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity to fix the flaws of the novel (of which there are many), Josh Boone simply compounds them in a film that is truly excruciating to watch.

  The film centers around Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley), a sixteen year old with terminal thyroid cancer. Initially diagnosed at age thirteen, she is able to function with the aid of an experimental drug, though she begins to exhibit signs of depression at the thought of her inevitable death. Her parents, played by Laura Dern and Sam Trammell, grow increasingly concerned with Hazel's behavior and force her to go to a cancer support group at a local Episcopal church. While there, she meets - and eventually falls in love with - Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a cancer survivor who lost a leg in the process.

  If you are unfamiliar with the the story and want a reasonable description of the two main characters involved, I'll tell you. Hazel is essentially the cinematic equivalent of Holden Caulfield, except she is arguably more annoying. In the initial sequence of the film, she speaks in a voice-over narration, describing her condition in what amounts to nothing more than existential moaning and groaning. Throughout the film, she spouts naive social commentary, punctuated by the occasional trite observation ( ""Depression isn't a side effect of cancer; it's a side effect of dying.""). Yes, that is an actual quote from the film. Augustus Waters, similarly, suffers under the weight of poor writing. He also speaks mostly in platitudes ( ""This silence is deafening.""; ""You look ravishing.""; ""So, yeah, that just happened.""). His character arc, to the extent he has one, modulates very little in the first two-thirds of the film. Nor does it help that Ansel Elgort gives a very artificial performance. Don't expect to see him in many films in the future.

  Around the halfway point, Hazel and Augustus travel to Amsterdam to meet the reclusive author of a book they love. The meeting between Hazel, Augustus, and the author (Willem Defoe) provides one of the few genuine moments in the entire film. Ironically, despite being targeted as the ""bad guy"", Willem Defoe's performance is one of the film's few bright spots.

  In the final act, the emotional manipulation is magnified, as the outcome of this cancer movie moves towards its inevitable conclusion. Most of the scenes in the final portion are purely self-indulgent and exist only to reduce the members of the audience to a puddle of tears. One scene, in particular, involving a ""pre-funeral"", was unbelievably contrived. I'm not necessarily opposed to films that are sentimental, but the mawkishness of ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is unbearable.

  To a certain degree, the film does seek to be more intelligent than the average ""tearjerker."" There is much talk about the idea of an afterlife and ""oblivion"", but ""The Fault in Our Stars"" offers no new insights on the human condition that weren't already rather obvious. The fact that this film is more well-known for its mawkishness than the inherent intelligence of the story should be a solid testament to its overall quality (or the lack thereof).

  What did I dislike the most about ""The Fault in Our Stars""? Perhaps it was the weak characterizations of its leads. Perhaps it was the excessively moody soundtrack that told you how you must feel every ten minutes. Perhaps it was the hackneyed and manipulative script. All, however, are good reasons to avoid spending the time and money to watch this rather mediocre film.",1406678400,25,3981,4.9969742813918305

The movie is not inapropriate anything but the message and heavy content of the movie will touch your heart.  Some of the things in this movie may be hard to comprehend for children under the age of 13. I did not have any problems with understanding the messages as I am 16.

I basically have the book memorized this point so I notice all the minor changes, but overall I felt like it did the book justice, and that's all I can ask for. I did see this movie a total of 6 times in theaters so far and I rarely ever see a movie more than once while in theaters. It's just so amazing that I have to see it again and again.
If you aren't into sad movies or teenage love stories this it's not for you, but if you like a bittersweet love story you'll love this movie. It has a messages that anyone can learn from, especially by how we view sick people in our society.

6380926,5,B00JLC57OW,"Upon meeting Hazel Lancaster, we understand that she has thyroid cancer . While on her way to a cancer support group in (I quote) "" the heart of Jesus"" she mistakenly bumps into a boy. Much to her surprise,  Augustus Waters can not stop staring at Hazel. Little does Hazel know is that there is more to Augustus than meets the eye.

The Fault in our Stars offers a lot of good things as a movie ladies and gentlemen. Yes people label this movie romance and yes there are in fact romantic moments in the movie but the movie itself is more than just two kids falling in love. It's about having hope when others around you have given up. It's about accepting whatever comes your way and facing adversity head on . Shailene Woodley knows exactly what I'm talking about here. Hazel is the embodiment of these traits  I just mentioned. I was Highly impressed (and deeply moved a few times) with the way Shailene Woodley handled playing Hazel. Ansel Elgort has a nice outing as Augustus Waters in the movie. He may be over the top in the confidence department, but he exhibits a likable charm and clever attitude throughout the film so well, that it's hard to not like his character. Willem Dafoe also stars as Peter Van Houten author of An Imperial Affliction which happens to be the book Hazel is a big fan of.  I enjoyed his take on the character;  he was rather uh, interesting to say the very least. Nat Wolff also plays Augustus's friend Issac and he did a good job. Sam Trammell and Laura Dern star as Michael and Frannie Lancaster and they were also good in their respective roles.

I admit I have not read the book though I do intend to, but I like how the story in the movie progresses. The Fault in our Stars works well as a drama due to each act being directed extensively, and again with the positive acting on both sides.

But above all else my friends, something about The Fault in our Stars sticks with you. And strangely enough, I cannot yet decide what exactly it is. Maybe it's Shailene Woodley's uplifting performance in the movie. Maybe it's the fact that I cared about the characters in the movie. Or maybe just maybe, it is the overall feeling I had once the movie was over.

So there you have it. I have given my thoughts on The Fault in our Stars the movie. I gave my thoughts on the acting, the story, and the movie as a whole. I definitely will be getting the book as well as the blu ray in the foreseeable future, and as for the score well, here it is

6380927,1,B00JLC57OW,"So, so, so, so bad.  Yikes, where to begin???  There are faults a-plenty in this sappy, cliched, unrealistic, unmoving movie, but then again I'm getting old, 59, and I'm guessing the target audience is much younger.  Among my gripes:  the cartoonish depiction of the Christian support group leader as a pathetic loser who hooks religious-themed rugs during his recovery from ""ball cancer"" (which is the way Shailene Woodley's character refers to it in a snarky voiceover) and invites the group members to ""sit in the literal heart of Jesus!"" whose image is on the rug... HA-HA-HA, WHAT A DORK!  That's the intended reaction for the audience.  All through this boring movie, the audience is manipulated to react in very specific ways with the subtlety of a gong to the head.  We're mainly to feel crushing sorrow and heroic admiration for the simply adorable lead characters who are, after all, cancer victims.  Oddly enough, they're as lithe and fit as Abercrombie models, with snappy dialogue and sassy one-liners.  You know, just like teenagers with terminal cancer in real life!  Shailene Woodley's character wears an oxygen tube which is meant to stab you in the heart with pity, but it just didn't work for me.  Because other than her cute little tube, and the oxygen canister she lugs around martyr-style, with many a fainting pause even as she's refusing help, she's the picture of health.  Ain't nothing different about her life with cancer...she drives, she dates, she drinks, she has sex.  The guy character, Gus, looks like an Olympian until he raises his jeans to show a prosthetic leg... my only reaction to this scene, obviously intended to stun, was to muse on how special effects are done in the movies, since the guy clearly doesn't have a missing leg.  His personality was grating to the point of wanting to hurl things at the screen, but that's just a personal reaction.  If he said the name ""Hazel Grace"" once (because he thought it was cute to call Woodley's character by her full clunky name), he said it six million times, always with a smirk to show how cute he was to use her full name.  His disclosure to Hazel Grace that he was still a virgin was meant to evoke our pity and shock, much as it evoked Hazel Grace's... a virgin!  At your ripe old age of 18??!??!!  How the HELL did that happen???  Oooooh, it's because you have CANCER.  Well, we'll fix that!  As soon as we go on a magic trip to Amsterdam, and toss back a few bottles of Dom Perignon at a five-star restaurant while everyone gazes at us adoringly, we'll go back to our ritzy hotel room and get it on!!  (with Hazel Grace's mom in the adjoining room, and whose reaction to the kids' night of love is to smile sweetly and tell them how adorable they are.)  I could go on and on -- like the scene where Hazel Grace and Gus make out in the Anne Frank Museum (yes, right in the room where Anne hid), and all the other tourists slowly, appreciatively, lovingly, applaud them.  WHA??????  Revolting.  Willem Dafoe plays an alcoholic weirdo author who lives in Amsterdam but suddenly shows up at (spoiler alert) Gus's funeral in America (because oh yeah, Gus suddenly croaks after a harrowing bout of... what?  Nothing led up to his demise, other than a trip to the gas station which apparently did him in.)  In real life, I watched my darling brother-in-law suffer through leukemia in his mid-20s, then die from it at 32.  Actual cancer looks nothing like this Hollywood version.  This movie was offensive to me on every level and I would've walked out except I was there as my neighbor's guest.  Come to find out, she hated it too!  This being amazon, I know I'm in for a slew of insults, protests, accusations, and hate mail but oh well, it's my opinion and I'm putting it out there!  One other thing -- I cry far too easily (i.e. the end of certain Modern Family episodes and those Bud commercials with the Clydesdales) but I literally didn't squeak out a single tear through the entire film.",1403568000,47,3980,4.6239316239316235
6380928,3,B00JLC57OW,"So I understand that four spots out of top five books in young adult fiction are John Green's. And I realize that the movie will translate that demand and hold some of that appeal. This movie price, unfortunately, reflects an over-confidence in supply/demand economics. I resent that the admiration of the talent of this writer necessitates the robbing of the wallets of the youth that he professes to admire and by extension the emotional blackmail of their parents. I will not pre-order this book turned movie. However, I will be patient and when the ""blush falls off the rose"", I may consider the purchase next year when it is in the ten dollar movie bin at Wal-mart.
If the pre-order price was even a few dollars less or if they were donating some of the proceeds to ""This Star Won't Go Out"", Esther's Day non-profit for cancer victims and their families, I wouldn't have felt the need for this review about Hollywood avarice.",1403308800,,930,4.711656441717792

6380930,5,B00JLC57OW,"For starters, this movie will make even the most hard of hearts cry. If you've read the book, you know what will be coming, and you will cry anyway. If you haven't, then the pain of the heartbreak will just flow over you in waves of intense emotion that will only cease whenever you decide to get a hold of yourself. But honestly, you won't want to.

The story is not like most of the teenage movies you see today, filled with fantasy and werewolves, but instead of the most unlikely people. The sick ones, the ones that only stand out because they themselves have a defect. For Augustus, the fake leg, and for Hazel, and oxygen tank that she has to wheel around with her. They fall in love through a cancer support group, and go on a trip to meet Van Houten, the author of Hazel's favorite book. Though as the trip does not go as they planned, they make the very best of it until the secret is out right before they leave, and the movie takes a turn towards the neverending waterfall of tears.
I won't spoil it for you, but the ending is tragic.

More than half of the movie is quoted directly from the book, which is just something that is unheard of in today's book to film adaptations. The soundtrack for the movie is stellar, with lyrics that only increase the tears throughout the movie. The acting is spectacular, especially in the gas station scene, as well as the Pre-Funeral.
My only complaint is that they left out one of my favorite lines in the entire book. ""My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations."" A short phrase, really, but such an important one. They leave out little details like the machine that helps her breathe at night, her blue teddy bear, and the fact that she looks like Caroline Mathers, Gus' old girlfriend. That being said, all of these things were not necessary to the movie in any way shape or form, just to the book, and tbh, I am okay with these changes.

Overall, this is by far the best book to film adaptation I have ever seen. I'm impressed and heartbroken in the best possible way.",1403049600,4,2039,4.403183023872679
6380931,4,B00JLC57OW,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

Like I suspect everybody, I went into this film having a pretty good idea of what it is about and its consequences.  I was primarily attracted by Shailene Woodley who has been so good in everything she's ever done professionally.  This film is no exception.  Here she plays Hazel, a 16 year old with cancer.  The cancer has affected her breathing so she walks around hauling a portable oxygen tank that constantly feeds her through one of those removable tubes attached to her nose.

Her parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) are constantly nearby and while Hazel understands, she also finds it a bit annoying.  Reluctantly Hazel begins to go to a support group where she meets 18 year old Gus (Ansel Elgort who ironically played Woodley's character's brother in ""Divergent"").  Gus has had his own battle with cancer losing a leg below the knee.  He appears to be in remission, while Hazel battles on with occasional trips to the ER.  After both make goo-goo eyes at each other they get together, as friends of course.  The chemistry between the two is very good.  Both are a bit acerbic but are usually in good spirits and use their humor to keep things in perspective.

Hazel asks Gus to read one of her favorite books and to her surprise, he understands it.  This leads to their hunt for the author who left the story without a perfect ending, even to the point of concluding the novel mid-sentence.  Van Houten (a scene chewing Willem Dafoe), never wrote again (ever heard that plot point before?) and has become a recluse in Amsterdam...The Netherlands one.  Much to their ultimate disappointment they make the trip, with mom as chaperone, and hook up with the cranky author.

Even without reading the book by John Green, you just know this isn't going to end with grins and giggles, but give the director (Josh Boone) and the writers (Scott Neustadter & Michael H. Weber) credit for not making it a maudlin, morose journey.  Don't get me wrong, tears will be shed but what do you expect?  The film isn't perfect to be sure.  Gus's occasional smugness can be a bit annoying as is his metaphorically unlit cigarette dangling from his lips.  You will also recognize a clich or two.  Minor quibbles aside, Ms.  Woodley's performance is worth watching alone.  The film is sad at times, funny most of the time and is just about 2 young people falling in love that just happen to have cancer.  Recommended.",1402963200,,2449,4.7035294117647055

The film is loaded with metaphors and messages. Gus' cigarette being the most powerful. It is ""Love Story"" for a new generation. The film will bea ""people's choice"" more than a critic's choice.

6380934,5,B00JLC57OW,"Never have I seen a movie so heart wrenching as this one. The Fault In Our Stars is an exceptional movie that will have you crying, laughing and anxious all at the same time. It is based on the amazing novel written by John Green. In this movie, Shailene Woodley plays Hazel Grace, a girl diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Ansel Elgort plays Gus Waters who is diagnosed with cancer as well. They fell in love with each other the way we fall asleep, slowly and then all at once. Their journey goes from meeting their favorite author in Amsterdam to rushing to the hospital for immediate chemotherapy.  This movie shows the hardships of being in love and fighting for your life in such a beautiful but realistic manner. I absolutely love this film.

There are so many great aspects about this movie that its hard to highlight a few. However, one of my favorite things is the whole plot and its meaning. It creatively captures a teenagers perspective of love but also of dealing with cancer. It reaches out to a younger audience but still allows an older audience to enjoy it.  John Green knows how to grab the audience's attention by intertwining the two most heart-wrenching aspects of life - love and death. Another thing I really love about the movie is how well it depicts the book it is based on. I read the book a few months ago and I loved how the director put in just enough of the details to keep its authenticity. I didn't feel like there was anything missing. Overall, this movie is extremely great and I want everyone to enjoy it as I did.

My favorite character is Hazel Grace Lancaster. Hazel is witty and smart but also strong and understands things. She teaches Gus a lot about books and how not to be afraid of oblivion. Hazel knows shes going to die but she accepts that and she wants her parents to accept that too. I think a lot of teens going through love or even pain can relate to Hazel Grace.

My favorite scene is when Hazel, Gus and Isaac go to Isaacs ex-girlfriends house. Isaacs ex-girlfriend, Monica, dumped Isaac because he was going to have eye surgery which would leave him blind. Right before the surgery, Monica dumped Isaac and never even asked if he was okay. Hazel, Gus and Isaac want revenge so they go to egg her house. This part is so funny because Isaac is blind and he cant see where hes throwing the eggs. This struck me as so funny because hes throwing the eggs in the bushes and at the trees but Hazel and Gus try to keep his spirit up by giving him encouragement. It is just a funny scene.
I recommend this movie for ages 12 to 18 because it is a lot to comprehend and some of the information about death may be too much for young children. I am 14 and have never cried so much in two hours. This is an amazing movie and I give it 5 out of 5 stars. This is a great movie for teens to go out and watch with friends. It comes out this weekend so make sure you get to watch this movie, you won't regret it!

6380936,4,B00JLC57OW,"Nine Things about the Movie ""The Fault in Our Stars"" [USA, 2014]

1. This film is based on the young adult novel by the same name. It's about a girl with cancer that falls in love with a boy she meets at a support group. I never read it, because that's just not my kind of story. But friends that did read it were frothing at the mouth, proclaiming how good it was. So when the movie came out, I decided to give it a try.

2. A romantic drama about kids with cancer screams exploitation. Exploitation of cancer, and exploitation of the audience. I expected an emotionally-manipulative, sugar coated piece of crap that would give me diabetes.

3. I was so wrong. The movie knows what the conventions are for this kind of movie, and deliberately subverts them. It's a smart, clear-eyed look at terminal love.

4. The burgeoning relationship is handled well. The girl, Hazel, and the boy, Gus, struggle with their feelings for each other, knowing that the relationship can't go anywhere.

5. The movie stares death straight in the face. Hazel admits to an existential loneliness, while
Gus struggles to find a deeper meaning to his life.

6. There's a subplot where the two travel to Amsterdam to visit their favorite author (played with acidic gruffness by Willem Dafoe). The meeting does not go as well as the two had hoped, and the resulting feelings ripple through their world-views.

7. Hazel is played by Shailene Woodley and Gus is played by Ansel Elgort. They also played brother and sister in ""Divergent"". Woodley and Elgort are astounding in their portrayal of the characters. It's some of the best acting I've seen this year.

8. There are several times that the movie has the chance to veer into the typical romantic angst, or a depiction of courage in the face of impossible obstacles. But each time, it refuses to go there, staying on a more realistic path.

9. This movie sparkles with intelligence and wit and sorrow. Especially considering it's targeted at young people, it openly struggles with the harder truths about life, and doesn't flinch when it gives sad answers. I can see some parents having problems with letting their kid go see this. But the realistic trajectory of the movie is exactly what gives the movie a real heart, so when it does get emotional, it feels much more natural, not exploitative, to go with it.",1402704000,5,2340,4.68780487804878

Yes the story is super sad in parts but my thought is it may be sad but the love part of the story kind of makes up for the sad parts!! I didn't even wait till it had been released at the Theater's.

6380940,5,B00JLC57OW,"***This review assumes you have read the book A Fault in Our Stars and may have spoilers if you haven't.***
The Fault in Our Stars was one of the best books I read last year so I had high hopes that the movie would do the book justice. I was not disappointed.
When I heard that Shailene Woodley was cast as Hazel, I was concerned. I know her mostly from The Secret Life of the American Teenager and I never thought she was very good in that. Granted, that may have been because of the material she was given to work with. However, her acting was great in this movie. She conveyed complex emotions through subtle facial expressions. I was impressed. Her haircut and wardrobe made her sufficiently dowdy like I pictured Hazel would be.
Ansel Elgort was a good choice for Gus, both in looks and attitude. I was also happy with the rest of the cast. I'm a fan of Mike Birbiglia and was surprised that he was in this movie. He turned out to be great as the cheesy support group leader Mike. And True Blood fans - Sam (Sam Trammell) plays Hazel's dad!
The movie condensed the book in just the right way. Augustus still has some of his angsty, mature dialogue but not as much as in the book. I know some people thought the way he talked in the book was unrealistic. They will probably think the movie version is more believable. The one thing that bothered me is the stupid cigarette that Gus has dangling out of his mouth most of the time. I don't remember it being as prominent in the book. Maybe I just didn't visualize it when reading. Either way, I didn't care for it. It's supposed to be a metaphor but it seems like he depends on it as a comfort item, even though he never lights it of course. I remember the storyline with Hazel's favorite author (played by the awesome Willem Dafoe) being kind of zany in the book and it was too much for me. It's toned down nicely in the movie.
Even if you haven't read the book, this is a fantastic movie. It's a love story about two people who happen to have cancer. It's not overly sentimental or trite. I give it two thumbs way up!",1402272000,12,2071,4.272264631043257

Hazel Grace is 17, smart, and obsessive. She's also taking an experimental drug that gives her the ability to resist the build up of tumors in her lungs and to breathe. She falls for dreamy cancer survivor Augustus Waters, but wrestles with the guilt of the damage she will cause when she leaves (i.e. dies).

What did I think?

It may lack the explosions of a `summer blockbuster' but Hazel and Augustus are so beautifully portrayed it doesn't matter. A film about cancer will always have that sword of Damocles hanging over the characters' heads. It is impressive that knowing this going in, you still can't help yourself from falling for them both, knowing full well that every moment there's a medical discovery to be revealed, your heart will screw itself up into a knot.

If you are, or ever have been, a 17-year-old girl you should definitely see this gripping love story (remove half a star from the review if you've never been a 17-year-old girl, but it's still pretty good).

6380942,3,B00JLC57OW,"Move over ""Beaches,"" and' ""Terms of Endearment,"" and make room for ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" based on the best-seller by John Green, and starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, who play star-crossed young lovers and cancer survivors.  Both alas, fit the type most likely to come down with cancer in a Hollywood movie: white, relatively well-off, youthful and so dewy skinned and radiant that at times I felt like I was watching a shampoo commercial.  However, the acting of the two leads is excellent, as is the supporting cast, but the script - despite the narrator's insistence to the contrary - is formulaic.  The whole picture is beautifully choreographed and set to a fitting soundtrack, but to me, it often seemed manipulative.

Don't get me wrong.  Cancer is sad, and death is sad, and beautiful people dying well before they should, especially when they have a unique relationship and are soul mates is tragic, but I thought the director and scriptwriter didn't have to work quite so hard to convince me of this.  Case in point: the two take a trip to Amsterdam to visit a reclusive author that Shailene's character idolizes, and they also see the Anne Frank House.  We don't just get to see Shailene struggle to climb endless flights of stairs to reach the attic - we get to hear Anne's voiceover.  When the couple finally reach their destination, they are overcome and make out.  And - the icing on the cake - they are treated to a slow clap from the other tourists.  As a character in ""Not Another Teen Movie,"" says, ""You have to know when the right time is for a slow clap,' and this is definitely it.

There's a funeral at the end; actually there are kind of two funerals.  I won't give away who dies, in case you haven't read the book, but the last half hour of the movie ramps up the tear jerking to new heights.  (The two girls next to me sobbed nonstop.)  If you have a decently sized heart and a working set of tear ducts, you may want to bring along a box of Kleenex when you go see this movie.  If you, like me, have a cynical side, you may feel sorry for the characters but resent what seems like emotional blackmail.  The director employs every trick in the book to get you to weep, but if you'd rather not be subjected to such tactics, you may want to give this movie a pass.",1402185600,10,2302,4.458233890214797
6380943,5,B00JLC57OW,This teenage love story is unique. I just fell in love with all the characters. This  is a very heart felt movie. It will have you in tears.,1402185600,6,140,4.0
6380944,5,B00JLC57OW,"Theres a critics quote on the back of my copy of The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green, which I really felt captured the books essence and how it felt to read it. This is a book that will break your heart  not by wearing it down, but by making it bigger and bigger until it bursts. This is true. But, don't be mistaken. This is an emotionally exhausting story. All a movie of a beloved book can hope to accomplish is to do justice to the books essence, and to give the viewer the same feeling they had when reading it as a novel. The Fault in Our Stars does this, and then some.

Stars follows Hazel (Shailene Woodley), who was diagnosed with cancer at the age of thirteen. A clinical trial gave her a few good years, but she has never been really anything but terminal. Her behavior leads her parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammel) to believe shes depressed, and force her to attend an insufferable cancer support group, where she meets who turns out to be the love of her life, Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort).

So first, Ill calm the book readers down a bit. Woodley, who proved in 2011s The Descendants, that she is a dynamic actress, and could helm YA-novel adaptations without being compared to Kristen Stewart, makes for a dynamic Hazel, giving a sublime and beautiful performance that could (and should) earn her some Academy attention this winter. Elgort is brooding, romantic and infectiously charismatic  a pitch perfect Augustus. And best yet, these two young actors have a chemistry that is electric, and should hit non-fans just as hard as it does those familiar with the source material.

Amy Jellicoe, I mean, Laura Dern is lovely as Hazels martyr mother. Dern played Amy Jellicoe in one of my favorite television series of all time, HBOs cancelled-too-soon Enlightened, and she plays exactly the character from the book, and doesnt change much. Sam Trammel (HBOs True Blood) does nice work too. In the novel, Hazels father broke out crying almost every time she was in his presence, which Trammel doesnt do. I guess thats a good thing.

When the end-of-second-act plot twist hits, you will likely be in tears the entire third act of the movie, like I was. The books tone reminded me of Showtimes series The Big C. Its about a morbid subject  cancer, but treats its subject with lightness and finds a way to convey the humor in a terrible situation. The Fault in Our Stars is like the book in that way  it is at times grim and morbid in its detail about disease. But the characters manage to crack jokes about their awful predicament, which makes the third-act punch hurt a little less.

The film only makes a few slight changes in story from the book. Hazels friend Kaitlyn is written out completely, which actually works. Hazel is better portrayed as someone who was lonely and friendless until the great love of her life came around. Kaitlyn was an afterthought in the book anyway. The backstory of Augustuss previous girlfriend Caroline is also written out, which is not such a good choice. But a book fan is always going to find things to nitpick.

In the end, Josh Boone made a superb adaptation of a beloved novel, which captured what it felt like to read the book. Not only that, but it captures the unmistakable feeling of being in love for the first time. The film itself is heartbreaking (you will cryno way around it,) hopeful, wise, and acerbic in its wit. It will remind you not to live every day like its your last  but to just live.

6380945,5,B00JLC57OW,"Whenever I see a trailer for a new love story coming to theaters (whether it be involving sparkling vampires or the typical high-school sweethearts) I usually groan at how predictable and unoriginal the genre has become. But lucky for me, along with the fans of classic films like Say Anything that perfectly encapsulated young love, there's a new breed of filmmakers that are working to create beloved romance for this generation.

Just over a year ago we received the fantastic indie-drama The Spectacular Now from the spectacular writing team of Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber. It surely wasn't a sugar-coated work but it was authentic and true, and that's the prime reason why I enjoyed their newest book adaptation The Fault in Our Stars so much as well. It may seem like the typical movie fad of this summer but I think it will transcend its many teenage admirers and touch more people than you might think.

Based on John Green's best-selling novel of the same title, it follows the quirky and perpetually sweet relationship between two emotionally wounded young people: Hazel Grace, a girl permanently ridden with an oxygen tank at her side due to her constant bouts with cancer, and Augustus Waters, a boy who lost one of his legs due to similar clashes with his health. Meeting at a support group, they bond over their unusual outlooks on life and, as you can guess,  fall deeply in love.

But unlike most movies of the same kind, Stars doesn't feel the need to wrap everything up in a beautiful little package. It shows the harsh realities of life and how much you affect everyone around you without feeling overly preachy to the audience.

The two leads (Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort) are wonderful together, and their undeniably-great chemistry through all the scenes they share may annoy some -- but I found the dialogue between the two to be refreshing and sweet. My only gripe with the film is that we didn't get to delve too much into Isaac's character, though he was excellently portrayed by Nat Wolff. All in all, I felt the acting was stupendous and there was next to nothing wrong with the movie.

Rated PG-13 for language and sexuality, Stars is a sharp and charming look on love, and I urge you to give it a shot. It just may surprise you.",1401926400,6,2271,4.707808564231738
6380946,5,B00JLC57OW,"One of the great things about John Green's novel, The Fault In Our Stars, is that it isn't a typical cancer story. It isn't a typical anything, really, and even loosely considering it a ""cancer story"" seems like a momentary injustice. Nor does it quite conform to our traditional notions of sappy, angst-ridden teen romances. There's something quite extraordinary about the novel; its realized characters and full-hearted story of exceptional love, both of the romantic variety and the unbreakable love a parent has for their child. And because of all the things the book gets so right, the fact of Josh Boone's big screen adaptation nailing them so perfectly makes the film all the more special.

Right away the lead character, Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) lets you know this isn't going to your average everyday story, either. Hazel is a brilliant, witty, well-read young woman who also happens to have thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs. Because of it she carries an oxygen tank around with her and has little tubes connected to her nose. But her outlook on the situation is more acerbic than grim, with her clever and funny observations on ""cancer perks"" drawing the attention of Augustus ""Gus"" Waters (Ansel Elgort), a handsome, 18-year-old she meets at a cancer support group. Not exactly the ideal meet-cute, but then again nothing about their situation is truly ideal, which makes them finding one another such a thing of pure magic.

See, Augustus is currently in remission from osteosarcoma, ending his basketball career when the disease took his leg. Like Hazel, he has a somewhat offbeat perspective on life, and where she's a bit bleak he's of a sunnier disposition. They complete one another and learn from one another in just about every way imaginable. A voracious reader, Hazel introduces Gus to her favorite book, An Imperial Affliction, an extensive tome from a reclusive author now holed up in Amsterdam. Gus loves Hazel almost immediately, ingratiating himself into her life and charming her parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell), even though Hazel remains distant in an effort to hurt as few people as possible.

Green's novel, written with incredible care and emotional heft, does much of the heavy lifting for screenwriters Michael H. Weber and Scott Neustadter (500 Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now); both old hands at penning romances that are a little off the beaten path. They also know how to work with Woodley, who is content presenting Hazel and all of her flaws and quirks. Despite this being a story with a somewhat inevitably heart-wrenching conclusion, none of the characters are treated with kid gloves. Hazel has her issues; she's as stubborn and moody as she is funny and passionate. And while Woodley is careful not to make Hazel too precious, Elgort has the difficult job of making the all-too-perfect Gus seem like a real person. A boy with a fondness for grand symbolic gestures, Gus will give you flashbacks of Say Anything's Lloyd Dobbler, and Elgort's performance on par with John Cusack's. Elgort, who played Woodley's brother in Divergent just a couple of months ago, exudes confidence without being brash. Both he and Woodley capture the frailty and strength in these wonderful, unforgettable characters. Beyond the terrific pop culture references there are so many quotable lines that you'll want to try them out on your significant other.

There are a few small changes from the novel that don't completely work, mainly in the streamlining of the relationship between Hazel and Gus. It's almost too planned, too preordained the journey they are on. As wonderful and heartbreaking as the performances by Dern and Trammell, there needed to be more of Hazel's relationship with her parents, who are on just as much of an emotional roller coaster. But these are small quibbles, and to include more would detract from every cherished moment with Gus and Hazel, and we simply can't have that. The Fault In Our Stars isn't a story about two people dying from cancer, but of two people who lived and loved to the fullest extent despite it. Everything that made John Green's book so great is here, so maybe just this once the world really is ""a wish-granting factory.""",1401926400,10,4236,4.978813559322034
6380947,5,B00JLC57OW,"Last night I saw an advanced screening of the film expecting the best: the book was already an amazing work of art written by an amazing author, and since he was involved in the making of this movie, I felt more secure with it, because let's face it: Hollywood has screwed up some great books with horrible movie adaptations, but that's not the case with ""The Fault in our Stars"".
The film is a faithful adaptation to John Green's work, in my case I even read the book for the second time a week before the day I would see it to see how much of the book was left out, and pretty much everything is on the film, like in any book adaptation, some stuff is skipped (but not really important stuff, so if you watch the film with an open mind you won't care), and some parts are put together to save time.
The movie tells the story of the book so well and you feel like you're really reading the book all over again. Ansel and Shailene have undeniable chemistry, they were the perfect choice to play the main characters, but I was a little insecure since they played siblings recently on Divergent, but you forget about Divergent as soon as ""Hazel"" and ""Gus"" meet for the first time. The chemistry is just there. The rest of the cast is amazing, the locations and the direction by Josh Boone was good as well.
You laugh, you cry... you have everything of what a good movie should be. If you saw the movie without reading the book, then read it! You'll love it as much as the movie.",1401667200,7,1476,4.275
6380948,5,B00JLC57OW,"I highly recommend this movie.

It's a sensitive adaptation of the best selling young adult novel.

What is it about? It's a love story- two star crossed lovers who find each other through their fight with a common enemy: cancer.

Shailene Woodley is perfectly cast, as Hazel Grace Lancaster, a normal teenage girl coping with all of the agonies of growing up, with the additional challenge of battling cancer.

The story explores her battle with cancer, as well as her first romance and the frustrations of growing up.

Laura Dern stands out as Hazel's loving mother, who portrays all the love and angst of the parent of a terminally ill child.

There's a subplot involving Hazel visiting a famous author in Amsterdam (a cantankerous Willam Defoe), and a poignant visit to the home of Anne Frank.

This type of story is difficult to bring to the screen successfully- the artistic talents involved have done that, creating a beautiful and moving cinematic experience, which is well worthwhile.

The other will make you want to hate tweet John Green for writing such an emotionally tormenting story

First off you will probably cry at this film more than you ever have at a movie. You will probably ugly cry. Just warning you! The film of The Fault in Our Stars is a great adaption of a beautiful and wonderfully-written novel. It's sort of perfect.

I think they picked the perfect actors to play the roles so many have come to appreciate through the book and the film follows along the story well, being true to Green's excellente novel. When it's brought to life, there's actually more emotion and feeling than I felt with the book, which is saying alot. I love when Agustus Waters compliments Hazel Grace with her canula draped under her nose and over her ears. I couldn't stop bawling and my heart kinda flutters now every time I hear someone say ""okay"".

The acting is good and maintains the believability of the characters and the story, which is important because while these are everyday teens living in an everyday town, their fight with a horrible disease and the unusual things it makes people do is tough to pull off if you're not a good actor. Shailene and Ansel certainly are.
