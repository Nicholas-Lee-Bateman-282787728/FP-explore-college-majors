1970267,4,B00014K58W,"A gritty and violent study of a group of thoroughly unlikeable and pathetic lowlives. It's very well acted, and I was pleasantly surprised to see Lisa Kudrow put in a nice performance as John Holmes' first wife. You almost feel like you're a fly on the wall choking on the secondhand cigarette smoke as these people slither and stumble through their stoned paces. Features a cameo by the always-annoying and vapid Paris Hilton that is redeemed by Eric Bogosian(playing L.A. drug/nightclub kingpin Eddie Nash) telling her to ""get out of here"". The bonus materials are great(how did they get that LAPD video?) and the limited edition version comes with the documentary ""Wadd"" as a bonus disc, which is also very good, arguably better than the movie.",1076803200,,747,4.936507936507937
1970268,5,B00014K58W,"Though ""Wonderland"" has its flaws...I am a sucker for period pieces and I will say this is a superb movie..mainly due to the strong performances of Bosworth, McDermott(I dare you to identify him w/o help), Kudrow, Lucas, others and of course Kilmer...This guy plays real life roles better than anyone!! The story of the gruesome, and they are gruesome Wonderland murders is told in Rashomon style but this movie grabs you and doesn't let you go...Superb music from the late 70's and early 80's as well..if you also look hard enough you'll notice a cameo by filthy rich princess Paris Hilton...This movie was very underrated in its theatrical release but now it should get its due on DVD...buy the DVD...you get like 5 hours of total footage..including a very graphic LAPD crime tape...very graphic...The Johnny Wadd Documentary...which is priceless..Deleted Scenes..Trailers..Interviews....Commentary..man it's got it all...check it out",1076803200,3,936,5.417808219178082
1970269,5,B00014K58W,"This DVD set is great. I had seen the movie ""Wonderland"" when it was in theatres back in Oct. but the release of this two DVD set with all the extras like the LAPD crime scene video and the documentary WADD:The Life and Times of John C.

1970270,5,B00014K58W,"This movie is a look at the life of John C. Holmes after his
star had lost it's luster in the world of porn. During the 1970's
and 1980's Holmes was called a legend in the world of porn. This
movie shows his cocaine addiction and the unflattering state of his life. The star who demanded and got paid top dollar for his
starring roles in porno movie had become a deadbeat dopehead. He
was keeping the company of thugs who had a strong desire for
narcotics. This group robs a notorious hoodlum named Eddie Nash.
Holmes helps Eddie Nash break into the living quarters of the
group that committed the killing. Holmes is tried for murder and
found not guilty. He died of aids in 1988. This was an interesting
tale on the Wonderland murders. John Holmes was not the king of porn in this movie. The role of hid wife was also well played.
Watch this movie. It is very informative.",1076716800,2,873,4.361963190184049
1970271,4,B00014K58W,"WONDERLAND is a terrific piece of filmmaking.  Director James Cox has taken a true story (the still unsolved Wonderland murders of 1981) and recreates it through the eyes of the people around the periphery of this despicable slaughter.  By utilizing the handheld camera, extraordinary editing techniques, and finding the core of the drug-induced delusional/hallucinatory perspective of the victims and possible perpetrators, Cox has succeeded in giving us a ""slice"" of reality and in further justifying why all the pieces will probably never be pieced together correctly.
Wonderland is a street in Laurel Canyon ( Southern California)and this is the site of the murders of 4 wacko druggies and drug dealers.  The centerpiece of the story is an attempt to explain the involvement of infamous Porn Star John Holmes (who died of AIDS in 1998) in this Manson-Mimic mass murder.  Cox has selected fine actors to enact the roles, many of them cast in roles completely opposite to their public personas:  Dylan McDermott is a sleazy biker who is one of the first to rat to the police, Lisa Kudrow plays the estranged wife of Holmes, Kate Bosworth is Holmes 'girl' who just happens to be close to his estranged wife (!), Josh Lucas as an utterly spaced-out junky mastermind and victim, Tim Blake Nelson as another of the druggie victims, Eric Bogosian as Eddie Nash - a drug lord addicted to his work, and Franky G as one of the cops (still showing great promise as an important character actor), and of course Val Kilmer giving a consistently fine, fully realized performance as the Porn King John Holmes.
This film is as close to being a direct observer of a slaughter as the viewer will ever get.  It is amazingly realistic, very graphic, and gut-wrenchingly believable.  WONDERLAND is not a film for the queasy, but when the film is dissected and all its parts examined (cinematography, rhythm, re-creation of a crime scene, music, and a lingering insight into the drug-user psyche) then this is a fine achievement.  The bonus (!) selections are almost too grisly to bear.  A definite Genre film, worth watching as an art piece.",1076716800,2,2124,4.927170868347339
1970272,4,B00014K58W,"This is a great true crime dvd. I love the way it was constructed, intertwining different points of view as to what occured on Wonderland Ave.
What puzzles me is ""Where do I get the book about this murder that was advertised on the Court TV clip?"" It's called ""Four On The Floor"", and was written by Robert Souza and Tom Lange, both LAPD detectives. Can't locate it anywhere.",1076630400,2,375,4.449275362318841
1970273,4,B00014K58W,"This film gives you two points of view of the Wonderland murders.  One from Dylan McDermott and one from Val Kilmer (as John Holmes).  I think the sheer brutality of these murders are enough to captivate, but the film basically goes nowhere.  You don't learn anything about Holmes other than the fact that's he's a major drug addict.  The film has nothing to do with porn or sex.  It's a true crime movie that just never really gets off the ground.  The second disc is a documentary on Holmes himself.  That is the better disc.  It gives you an in-depth look at the life of a guy with a practical-joke sized piece of anatomy.  This documentary is far more interesting than the film Wonderland.
There is a 25 minute crime scene police video included as well.  It is as graphic as graphic gets.  The bodies are still there as the police carefully document the bloody scene.  I assume it's there for shock value.  Don't let your kids anywhere near this.",1076544000,64,950,4.517647058823529
1970274,3,B00014K58W,"When I first saw the preview for this film nearly a year ago, I was chomping at the bit to see it. The all-star cast, the real-life story of legendary porn star John Holmes, and the brutal murders at the downside of his career made this movie seem like a sure hit. But for the most part, it misses. First off, I have to say that the acting here is very good. Val Kilmer is always good, and he creates a charisma and vulnerability in Holmes that could be considered unexpected. Kate Bosworth plays his girlfriend with a wide-eyed innocence, and Lisa Kudrow is quietly strong as his wife. Josh Lucas and Dylan McDermot do well as drug-crazed lunatics and criminals.
That said, the problems here are with the plot. ""Wonderland"" is the telling of the multiple murders on Wonderland Avenue that seemed to have involved John Holmes on some way. One point of view is from Holmes and the other is from McDermot. There are some mildly clever writing tricks here, making the stories overlap at parts, and the manipulation of flashbacks, but this has been done before, and there is nothing new here.
The worst part of the writing is that the movie just ends out of nowhere. Nothing is really resolved, and all of the plot is concluded with text on the screen at the end of the film. I would have liked to see what happened to a certain point, instead of reading about it as Holmes drives off into the sunset, leaving the viewers unfulfilled. Also, as I was watching the opening credits, I was impressed at the cast, because everybody that was in this film seemed to be a pretty big actor. Brilliance is expected when an ensemble like this is put together, but most of them are used very little, if at all. Paris Hilton has more lines than the talented Jeanene Garofolo.
The soundtrack to ""Wonderland"" is very good, mostly dotted with 70's songs thrown in with a couple from the early 80's. Nothing special, but good nonetheless.
With a little resolution and a more concise script, this movie could have easily been five stars, but alas, it is only three, and that is only because of the interesting subject matter and a couple of strong performances. Maybe this film could not have lived up to my high hopes, but for a film with such promise, it really fails you in the end, no matter how interested you may find yourself as you're watching it. For a similar movie, but one that is extremely well-written, I would reccomend ""Boogie Nights"", from the genius director PT Anderson.",1076544000,,2467,4.558558558558558

I've never been to LA but I really felt like I was in 1981 Los Angeles.  There are so many Actors in this movie and every single one could be an award winner!  I'm very familiar with all the Actors & I wasn't seeing Actors performing...I felt like I was seeing the real story being played out on my screen.  I ordered & added it to my Prime Video Collection.  So glad I have it!  The music chosen for the film was absolutely perfect.  I read the review given by Roger Ebert when the movie first came out.  Fourteen years later I'm left wondering if we saw the same movie?!  Some found it convoluted, but I caught on very early on & found it easy to follow, but I can definitely see where anyone might get confused.  For those...all I can say is watch it again.

Its actually two versions of the same story, one told by John Holmes and the other by David Lind, a member of the Wonderland gang. Val Kilmer gives one of his best performances as John Holmes, and Lisa Kudrow's acting is superb.  My only disappointment with the movie is the way Dawn Schiller is portrayed, as weak and subservient to John's every whim.  Dawn is actually much stronger than portrayed here and stood up to John many times even if it meant taking a beating from him.

1970296,5,B00014K58W,"Just terrific, absorbing portrayal of a true story. In early 1980's, former porn star, John Holmes was too addicted to cocaine and free-basing to perform sexually.

To get free cocaine for his heavy habit, he befriended 2 sources, one a notorious, big drug dealer and killer who was a fan of Holmes, the other a group of dealers living in a suburban home on a street called Wonderland in the Laurel Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles.

The group ended robbing the big dealer of a million dollars in drugs and money - for which he retaliated by having them beaten to death.

What role Holmes played in the robbery and then in the murders is explored in the film with terrific against type acting, and you decide who you believe as the fascinating story is revealed.

Just great directing. I love the ending, too. A quality film that's highly entertaining. Val Kilmer turned the role down 8 times before he understood that it wasn't about pornography. He's a Christian Scientist and quite religious, and claims to have drowned while out surfing and come back.",1488499200,2,1057,4.728260869565218

1970402,5,B00014K58W,"Like others have commented, I also believe this is Val Kilmer's best work.  I was captivated by viewing it and have watched it several times since, always seeming to surprisingly discover something new I hadn't noticed in a prior time watching it.  What I found very sad is that this was based on a true story and I do believe John Holmes was framed for these murders and thankfully, eventually acquitted.  I also was convinced he and Dawn truly loved each other for a long time, but it didn't fully delve into how John pimped her out to obtain money for more drugs and I read that one scene where John beat Dawn when he forced her to hook up with Eddie Nash was intentionally cut out so John would appear more likable when John, in real life, eventually bat Dawn repeatedly to comply with his demands.  How very sad.  I also ordered and read Dawn Schiller's biography and was very grim in knowing what a neglectful upbringing she had.  When John lavished attention upon her, whereas her parents could have cared less whether she even ate, it's no wonder she fell in love with John and remained with him for five years.  Dylan McDermott was fabulous as David Lind, and I enjoyed Kate Bosworth's portrayal and beauty as Dawn. I never even knew anything about John Holmes and was very surprised he was married at the time; Lisa Kudrow portrayed his wife, Sharon.  Loved seeing Ted Levine again in his policeman/detective role, but it is Val Kilmer who truly stood out.  I always watch him intently and enjoy the expressions in his face, especially when he slightly smirks.  He is remarkable at staying in character at all times.",1421798400,2,1626,4.595155709342561

Then ""Wonderland""...whoa...big change of pace here folks.  Thought it couldn't be all that bad, after all Val Kilmer was in it...  Pretty boy Val may have been the most understandable character as big-time porn star John Holmes.

1970423,5,B00014K58W,"Another Val Kilmer movie that should be more popular.  He does  a great job of portraying John Holmes, a former porn star who was responsible for the Wonderland murders of 1980.  Drugs, violence, and a sense of doom keeps the attention span from waning.  There is not that much brutality, but what there is intense.  A great cast too:  Lisa Kudrow as a jaded wife, Dylan McDermot as a villainous biker, Josh Lucas as a violent party animal, and Eric Bogosian as a decadent night club owner.  The movie shows two alternate versions of what happened at Wonderland since the murder investigation never came to a definitive conclusion.

The blu-ray has good sound and picture quality, and has the same extra features as the DVD.  The John Holmes documentary is very good, giving a vivid picture of who he was and how he eventually became a coked out dirtbag.  There is also the LAPD video of the crime scene which is very grisly.  Both of them are great additions and enhance the overall viewing experience.",1402876800,,1003,4.674285714285714

1970426,5,B00014K58W,"The Wonderland murders involving, in one capacity or another, John Holmes aka The King Of Porn. I remember this taking place back then, in the summer of 1981. Problem back then was that we did not have the 'speed of light' news coverage that we have today. News of things which happened in say, Los Angeles, took awhile to reach Connecticut and when they did, it was often muddled with parts and pieces of the entire story missing or changed. So although I do recall this event from back then, it was not for some time after that I knew the entire story and Holmes' involvement. None-the-less it is a very interesting story of a horrible event that took place and the decent into a hellish nightmare for the man who was once on top of the world. That said, it is a rather depressing story as well. To 'witness' this man's 'fall from grace' leading to the end of his life is not exactly an uplifting story. I'm not sticking up for John Holmes as he was a questionable character at best to begin with. However to watch him and his once high and mighty 'empire' absolutely disintegrate around him is nearly a crime in and of itself.

I'm not going to go into the specifics of the movie. If you haven't seen it, watch it, Especially if you are old enough to remember the Wonderland murders. Lisa Kudrow as Sharon (John's wife) is positively perfect. Val Kilmer as the 'King' was spot on. My only gripe about the film is that is does jump around a bit. From present to past and back to present and back to past and as such, it can be confusing trying to keep track of who's who and how they were involved. Might even be beneficial to watch it twice. (I might do that myself). But because this is the true story of a horrific event (the murders) and the story of John Holmes' life absolutely unraveling around him to become a living hell, it actually is quite fascinating.",1397260800,6,1866,4.377521613832853

1970434,2,B00014K58W,"Val Kilmer was awesome in 'Top Gun' and 'Willow' many moons ago, but to stoop to this kind of half-baked uneven film making, gives a clue as to his more recent job offerings. The film is basically about a roomful of drug addled low lives, who are hedonistic and careless in the extreme. Every other scene has the same pack of miscreants sitting around the drug and accompanying paraphernalia covered coffee table, doing their best to get high, and basically arguing over how to score more drugs, and enough more for customers, so they can buy even more drugs. We all knew people like this and avoided them, knowing they would die young. What the movie does is add a controversial name like John Holmes to get everyone's attention, and then not solve the multiple murder mystery in which this fated porn star may or may not have participated. Thanks for nothing Hollywood. Unfortunately even the talented Lisa Kudrow phoned in her role. I give it two stars instead of one, for casting Paris Hilton as a mindless concubine - truth sometimes being stranger than fiction, an excellent but not too graphic murder scene, and pretty girls to ogle throughout. Understand though, that what draws people to this, the legend of 'Johnny Wadd', has little to do with anything in the film.",1391472000,,1275,4.747747747747748

1970455,3,B00014K58W,"I watched a documentary a while ago, which featured the girlfriend of John Holmes.  I believe that her name was ""Dawn,"" and so I'll use that name for simplicity.  That documentary was riveting, and I also believe that it was based upon and helped promote a book that she had written about her life.

And if you watch that documentary, you'd realize that it would be almost impossible to screw up this story.  But you'd be wrong.  You'd realize that it is quite possible while and after watching ""Wonderland.""

First of all, they started out too late in this story.  From what I remember, Mr. Holmes met Dawn when she was 15 and started a relationship with her, even though he was still married.  Here, you won't find out until perhaps the third act that he was still married, and you won't find out (perhaps ever) that Dawn was only 15 when they first met.  Perhaps the filmmakers hid this information from an American public, a public they knew might turn against them -- and Mr. Holmes -- if they knew?

Secondly, this narrative is told in a very non-linear way.  In general, I believe that screenplays should be written as linearly as is possible; it makes it easier for the viewer to follow.  But here, there are flashbacks, there are multiple points of view (which does work sometimes, as they show how different people remember different events from the past), etc.  Not only that, but too many characters are introduced but not introduced; you won't find out until much later who they really are and how they relate to Mr. Holmes or the story.

Third, when the ""druggies"" in this film are under the influence, the film uses different techniques -- blurred filming, blurred audio, etc. -- to make the viewer feel as if he is under the influence as well.  The filmmakers of ""Night Stalker"" tried this in a film that came out about the same time, to no more success than here.  I just felt like I needed some Dramamine at certain points along the way.

Ultimately, this film was almost a failure, just because the story was there, it was intriguing, but they seemed to want to screw it up for no apparent reason.  If you know some of the history about Mr. Holmes or ""Dawn,"" perhaps a mild recommendation.  Otherwise, this would be a pass by me.",1376179200,,2248,4.54726368159204

Nothing that delves into the mindset of those responsible for the gruesome crimes which the movie is about. Just tell us why the quadruple homicide happened. A drug dealer who used to appear in porn films is NOT  interesting enough to make a 2 hour movie about!
Obviously murder scenes are not going to be pretty and no one expects them to be. But it happened in gorgeous Los Angeles. I don't think putting in a few scenes here and there that would have been positive experiences to watch-so that the whole movie isn't just 2 hours of ""Yuck"" is asking too much- but this film's makers clearly disagree.
And next time do a little research,guys. Even drug dealers and people addicted to hard drugs sometimes carry on conversations other than JUST saying the ""F"" word every other second for two solid hours. Even if that does happen a lot in the real world,the movie is already about four people dying very grizzly deaths,and a lot of other gruesome crimes leading up to the mass killing. You didn't need to try to be offensive when that was already the topic.
If this film's creators wanted to get the attention of people who are interested in the murders that happened on Wonderland Avenue in 1981, for any reason other than being a sicko, why not put together something that intrigues people,makes them want to hear more,and makes them want to recommend the movie,even if the contents is extremely disturbing?",1361059200,4,1549,4.758364312267658

1970479,4,B00014K58W,"A former Adult Film star John Holmes (Val Kilmer) on the edge of his career and well on his way to becoming just another junkie finds himself in a very bad situation.  Holmes (Kilmer) is almost in a limbo between post stardom and lifelong drug addiction.  Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth) is his girlfriend and partner in his misadventures.

John continues to put himself and his girlfriend into one bad situation after another.  Finally his plans go horribly wrong, and he finds himself in situation far more sinister and horrific than he or anyone else involved would have ever imagined.

Problems arise between one of Johns friends Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) and a group of his other friends some of which are Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), David Lind (Dylan Mc Dermott), and Billy Several (Tim Blake Nelson).
Holmes friends hatch a plan along with him, or with his help (both of which are left open to interoperation) to rob his friend Eddie Nash.

From the time the plan is hatched, its clear its not going to work out well for anyone involved.

However there were some unexpectedly lighter spots in the film such as seeing Sharon Holmes (Lisa Kudrow) in a type of role I had at the time not yet seen her in.

While I had thought the movie would be entertaining, it was actually very good!  Of course this movie was not about the entire life of John Holmes, rather a series of events which he was either involved in and/or had some knowledge of.
I really had no idea what to expect from the film other than it was very good, and I had a felling it would be. I just had no idea what it was about the film that would make it good.  I guess interesting and fascinating would be better ways to describe the film.  Wonderland is one of those movies you cannot stop watching until it is over, even though the subject matter is dark and at time disturbing  you have to see what happens next.

How much of the film, if any was actually true in the way its portrayed is not clear  though its close enough to the events of the time to seem possible in the mind of the viewer.",1356134400,,2062,4.406332453825858

In presenting a number of competing perspectives on what exactly led to the killings, including several mildly different interpretations of the same scene, the idea is to leave ultimate judgment to the audience. Instead, the lack of conviction just results in a hazy, jumbled, inconclusive mess of rumor and uncertainty. Kilmer is miscast as the shady, self-serving loser at the end of his rope, and keeps trying to turn on the charisma when he should be cowering and sniveling. His big-name supporting cast only produces similarly phoned in performances, while a glut of gimmicky after-effects gives the whole picture the kind of sparkly, overproduced sheen that's usually reserved for car commercials.

1970491,4,B00014K58W,"I saw ""Wonderland"" not too long ago on HBO and it left me with such a disgusting feeling that I was compelled to research more about the 1981 Wonderland Murders.  In short, justice failed and four young drug addicts were brutally murdered for no good reason.

To think that people this rich can resort to such awful gangland tactics is a testament to the demonic power of drugs and at this time it was the rich man's drug--coke.  Crack and meth, two deadlier killers, had not gone down the socioeconomic rungs quite yet.

Let it be said once and for all that Val Kilmer doth not make a movie under any circumstances.  He is a 3rd rate actor who needs to be covered in tattoos, skull rings, or tons of caveman hair (as he is in his this one) to deliver even a passable performance.  The reason we sympathize with this wretched figure (John Holmes, ""legendary porn actor"" and drugged out washup) is all Kate Bosworth in her role as Dawn Schiller.  Holmes' only real contact to reality, Schiller stands out in stark contrast to the scum all around her.  She is a strong Catholic woman who still helps out her wasted and drug abused husband as a kind of act of corporal mercy, and refuses to divorce him.

John gets caught up with some seriously bad people (the worst played by Eric Bogosian of ""Law and Order"" fame) as Eddie Nash, one cruel SOB with a lot of power and influence in Hollywood.  John's friends get the bad idea of robbing him because they are fiends.  They use John as the ruse to get inside his mansion.  Big mistake.

1970495,5,B00014K58W,"This is a very good movie which tells about the horrendous wonderland murders of 1981. There is little doubt that John Holmes was at the murders wether he was forced to kill someone or not is not known. However the movie does depict the ruined lives of hard drug addicted people whose very existance is a nightmare wether they live in wonderland or not. They had degenerated into shambling people whose only reason to exist was to get high.
One reviewer says this movie doesn't make them sympathetic, well in truth , why these were people sinking into the abyss , all of their good qualities were lost in drug addiction. It reminded me of the many people I know who sank into the swamp of addiction. Who they were was gone mainly buried in the false promises of the drug culture, that brotherhood and good times will last, instead of a sordid selfabsorbed reality wether you can handle it or not. In fact I lost a friend two weeks ago , he was shot in the head over drugs.  He was two credits away from his college degree too.  This movie really does a great job in capturing the early 80's, a time of truly great music and longer hair on men was still around mainly. (it would fade out mainly for most men in  a few years time though),  val kilmer does a great job here depicting john holmes as the junkie he had become, ready to sell out anyone for a snort, and eric b is excellent as the gangster nash; the corrupted man who has enough money to escape justice. In fact the whole cast is excellent in this movie , you get a feeling for the reality of lost dreams not only in holmes life; who died of aids 7 years later but of everyone involved , people who just wanted to party and now have no existance but gettting high really, it's the trap that has destroyed millions of lives since the 60's ( a many more earlier but it wasn't mainstreamed then) , and there is no wonderland for most of  us in that lifestyle even in los angelos , unless it's like this well made movie which gives us both sides of the story and lets you decide what most likely happened. The sad fact is that four people who were lost souls finally lost their lives and there was little justice for them.  I think everyone involved with this movie did  a fine job in bringing back a lost drug era , the coke era, which was soon to be replaced by the even more deadly crack and meth eras.

1970497,4,B00014K58W,"WONDERLAND has many qualities to recommend it, including a unique style that is reminiscent of Friedkin's TO LIVE AND DIE IN LA, several superb performances, most obviously Val Kilmer's portrayal of John Holmes.

This film successfully captures the fright, the decadence, and the horror of that intersection of porn, narcissism and narcotics that was so hard to ignore in the Hollywood of the 80s.

A brave film--I put this in the same category with CHAPTER 27 as a bold film that everyone thought nobody should ever make because it touched on or overtly violated an unspoken taboo.

The scenes involving detectives trying to put the puzzle together are weak but common structural devices, and the cops are competent enough that these scenes are not silly.

The heart of the film involves the depiction of the sordid world of John Holmes and his sacrificial girlfriend and ex-wife.

In my opinion, this was a very underrated, underappreciated movie with guts, passion and insight.",1264377600,,980,5.062111801242236
1970498,5,B00014K58W,"""Wonderland"" depicts the events that happened on Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles during the summer of 1981 in which legendary porn star John Holmes was embroiled in a vicious multiple murder. By the turn of the eighties Holmes was a drug-ridden cocaine adddict who found himself washed-up as a porn actor. No longer in demand by adult studios for work due to his drug problem, Holmes started stealing and robbing from people to feed his habit. He also got himself involved with a bunch of shaddy characters in the drug trade. Eventually, things continued to spiral downward for Holmes as he was involved with the multiple murders of people at a house on Wonderland Avenue. Holmes insisted emphatically that he didn't perform the killings, but the film leaves the door open as to whether or not Holmes knew who did. Val Kilmer (who plays Holmes) does a good job in playing the porn king, but I only wish the film would have dealt more with Holme's life starting with his start in the adult film industry to his demise from AIDS in 1988. The filmakers could have done so much more with John Holme's lifestory. An even greater film than ""Wonderland"" is 1997's ""Boogie Nights"" starring Mark Whalberg playing a character based on Holmes. In that film we see how a young man enters the porn business and how his introduction to drugs nearly destroys him. Also, if you can find the two disc set of ""Wonderland"" grab it although I don't see any available on Amazon. That set contains a very informative documentary on John Holme's life called ""Wadd: The Life And times Of John C. Holmes"" and it's even better than ""Wonderland"" as people who knew Holmes is interviewed including his ex-wife.",1250899200,2,1683,4.727891156462585
1970499,3,B00014K58W,"In the 1970s, when pornographic movies became increasingly available to mainstream consumers, John Holmes (1944-1988) parlayed his supersized endowment into stardom.  Those who knew him well describe him as likeable but somewhat dim; when his stardom began to fade he had nothing on which to fall back, and he became just another drug-addicted has been, trading on what was left of his dubious celebrity for a line of cocaine here and a line of cocaine there.  In 1981 Holmes tended to bounce between big-time drug dealer Eddie Nash and a group of smaller-time dealers who lived on Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles--and found himself greatly over his head.

Police described the Wonderland murder case as the most gruesome murder scene since the 1969 Manson family killing spree.  Although theories differ in details, they are consistent in outline: Holmes set up Nash for robbery by the Wonderland dealers; Nash responded by having Holmes set up the Wonderland dealers for a mass hit, carried off by people weilding pipes.  Four people died, one survived with serious injuries and without memory of the attack.  The 2003 film WONDERLAND attempts to portray both the crimes and the conflicting stories that Holmes, Nash, a Wonderland insider, and others gave during the course of the investigation.

Val Kilmer is unexpectedly convincing as the whining John Holmes, unable to focus beyond the next score, coming up with one silly idea after another.  Lisa Kudrow is particularly memorable in the role of Holmes' estranged wife, Sharon; Kate Bosworth equals her as Holmes' current girl, Dawn Schiller.  Although the movie is littered with cameos that actually tend to distract--Paris Hilton and Carrie Fisher, among others--the supporting cast is also quite fine.  But the script, editing, and overall concept lets them down: it begins well and finishes well, but the middle portion of the film is weak and the overall movie lacks emotional or psychological depth.

WONDERLAND's characters are not likeable, and director and co-writer James Cox doesn't even attempt to find a means of bringing us inside their heads and lives in a way that makes them understandable, much less sympathetic. The film instead attempts to jump from character to character and idea to idea while also sliding back and forth in time--and in the process never quite stays in one place long enough for you get a firm grip.  Everything does eventually link up, but all the same you'd better not blink too often as the movie plays out: if you do, you'll be lost when the final credits role.

The film is also plagued by a lot of hand-held-camera cinematography, presumably in order to convey the drug-laden atmosphere through which the characters move; there are also quite a few graphics, split screens, and so on.  I find that a little of this goes quite a long way, and between the camera tricks and the constant shifts WONDERLAND looses focus and at times becomes a little wearing.

Even so, WONDERLAND still manages to be an interesting film, the sort of film that you wish had been undertaken by a great artist instead of director and co-writer James Cox, who would be most gracefully described as somewhat unpolished.  There are at least two DVD issues of the film, one that is the film alone, another which also includes a documentary on John Holmes that is actually more interesting than the movie itself; if you have to pick between the two, go with the latter.  Recommended, just don't expect too much.

1970501,2,B00014K58W,"Wonderland is a mediocrity with a poorly written central character. But
De Niro's performance as Max Cady, which could easily have gone over
the top, is the only thing that raises that trite thriller up to
mediocrity. Kilmer's Holmes does not elicit sympathy nor disdain, even
when he pimps his girlfriend Dawn to Nash, and later physically abuses
her. Yet, the scene where De Niro tries to seduce Juliette Lewis's
character still creeps a viewer out even as the written dialogue seems
absurd. THAT'S the difference!

To use a more contemporaneous actor, looking at Guy Pearce from Memento
shows the difference- as well. In Memento and The Salton Sea, both
actors shine, but compare them in lesser vehicles like The Time Machine
and The Saint. Pearce makes his character somewhat sympathetic & a
viewer almost empathizes with the hero of the unbelievable tale. Yet,
in The Saint, Kilmer lacks the suavity of Roger Moore's TV original,
and the role almost descends to parody with Simon Templar as a Lon
Chaney wannabe. He becomes a cartoon figure where Pearce's character
retains its integrity. This is why Kilmer has to be selective in roles
and films he chooses- he has a limited range and only when a role
niches in that role can his greatness shine. This is not so much a
criticism as a recognition, for Kilmer- as an actor- is like the 3
Bears' porridge. When he's in his range he's good- and he's very, very
good, but when he's not he's, well- a cool, tasteless grain-type
cereal.",1222214400,,1485,4.755813953488372

1970503,2,B00014K58W,"Presumably the director made this film frantic and confusing on purpose, to better simulate the world as seen through the eyes of coke addicts.

Even assuming that to be the case, though, the technique wasn't successful.  Tremendous demands are made on the viewer: unless you know a great deal about the Wonderland murders, you'll simply be on the wrong foot for virtually the entire film.

Unfortunately, if you DO know something about the Wonderland murders, this film has little of interest to add.

What's really great about this DVD, though, is not the film itself, but rather the feature-length documentary that comes on the second disk:  ""The Life and Times of Johnny Wadd.""  This is so well done that it alone is worth the price of admission:  it will tell you all you ever wanted to know about not only John Holmes, but the Wonderland murders as well.",1214524800,3,860,4.77027027027027
1970504,4,B00014K58W,"Basically, this film suffers from having been released after Boogie Nights.  Where that film was loosely based upon the life and deeds of John Holmes, Wonderland attempts to detail the last public burst of attention Holmes received and why such came to pass.  It is a Rashomon-like retelling of the Wonderland Avenue murders, from the viewpoints of Holmes and sometime accomplice David Lind.  A third version of Holmes' involvement, that of a police detective investigating the murders, is briefly alluded to, but is relegated to an end-of-film ""what if"" thread.  The viewer must be warned that a certain bit of dramatic license has apparently been taken by the creative team behind the film, as written and other documentary sources seem to allude to other specific details of the actual murders which either are not included in Wonderland or have been slightly altered.  What is depicted, in all its sleazy, pathetic glory is the intersection of porn, drugs, and the cult of personality that grew around such ""performers"" as John Holmes.  Where Boogie Nights leavened the first half of it's narrative with humor and a tongue-in-cheek viewpoint, Wonderland dumps the viewer headlong into a boiling stew of cocaine, prostitution, violence, guilt, and desperation.  None of the acting performances can be faulted, but Val Kilmer's turn as John Holmes and Lisa Kudrow's as his estranged wife stand out in particular.  Still, even with an unusually strong acting troupe and a compelling story, Wonderland just doesn't seem to come together as it should have.  It's still a good film, and definitely worth a look, if only to see what the world of porn and drugs was really like at the turn of the Eighties.  If possible, get the two-disc version, as it contains the documentary Wadd:  The Life and Times of John C. Holmes as a bonus feature.  This film documents Holmes' rise and fall in excruciating, heartbreaking detail.  No matter what one's opinion of pornography is, Holmes' story is ultimately one of tragedy, and his collapse into himself is one of the cautionary tales of our time, one that should be passed on to anyone who thinks that they're going to become a ""star"" by following in his footsteps.  This is only my opinion; yours on the subject may be far different.  However, Wadd is a riveting documentary and alone is worth the price of admission.",1212969600,7,2358,4.949238578680203
1970505,2,B00014K58W,"A policeman called it the most horrific crime scene he had ever seen: An elegant townhouse on trendy Wonderland Avenue in the Hollywood Hills whose walls and ceiling were virtually painted with blood and brains.  Unknown assailants had surprised the residents at dawn and savagely bashed in their skulls with steel pipes.  The four dead were almost unrecognizable; a fifth survived with permanent brain damage.  Three of them were women.  The horror that rippled through L.A. when the news hit the streets has been compared to that caused by the Manson Murders.

This anxiety wasn't only due to the posh address or the body count.  The massacre occurred in the summer of 1981, which, like the Manson summer of '69, was a time of transition.  L.A. was still all about sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, but the heady blush of the '70's was wearing off and the ground rules had changed.  This theme was explored in Paul Thomas Anderson's film ""Boogie Nights,"" which dramatized the home invasion of a drug lord that led to the Wonderland killings.  Though the affair is often called a ""mystery,"" one fact is beyond dispute: both crimes were set up by porno king John Holmes.

Mike Sager's essay ""The Devil and John Holmes"" tells it all, and more effectively than this botched movie: by '81 Holmes was a washed-up cokehead supporting himself by petty theft and running drugs for the dealer denizens of the Wonderland house.  One day Holmes dipped into the blow he was supposed to deliver and was threatened by the gang's leader, Dan Launius.  I can make it up to you, Holmes told him; I have this friend, see...Holmes was a regular at the Hollywood mansion of Arab mobster Eddie Nash, owner of the Starwood club.  With Holmes's help, the Wonderland Gang invaded Nash's home, brutalized Nash and his bodyguard, and made off with $1.3 million in booty.  Two days later, the reckoning (see above).

James Cox's ""Wonderland"" tries to tell the story of this stomach-churning chain of events.  It's the classic case of a bad movie that clearly unraveled before even leaving the pitch room.  Attempting an ""edgy,"" underground novelty like ""Boogie Nights,"" Cox made the mistake of running with every idea prompted by the source material.  The murders led him to imitate ""In Cold Blood,"" the drug use to steal bad psychedelia from ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Requiem for a Dream,"" the conflicting testimonies to parrot ""Rashomon"" and ""JFK""...""Wonderland"" tries to be so many other movies it forgets to be itself.

It starts off with a naturalistic tone, ugly but riveting, then blows it all on vagueness and silly camp.  Soon you lose track of whose testimony is being dramatized, because the acts you see begin to have no relation to the characters' words and you wonder, did someone really describe Holmes as gleefully bashing heads?  Or did you guys just make that crap up?  The mind behind the movie starts to seem as feckless and sketchy as its characters.  Meanwhile, the period design collapses beneath countless anachronisms.  Your trust suffers early on when Carrie Fisher plays a Holy Roller; by the time a ""hip"" character starts referencing Primal Scream Therapy (in 1981!!), you have lost all faith.

David Lind, the White Supremacist biker who served as the Wonderland Gang's muscle (played with a glued-on pirate beard by a miscast Dylan McDermott) is emotionally engaging in the film's first third: he vents his anguish at the murder of his girlfriend and paints a fond picture of the party-life at the townhouse.  After his bare-bulb testimony, however, he disappears and we are left with the emotionally and morally blank Holmes.  The film implodes because drama requires connection, and it's impossible to comprehend, much less empathize with, Holmes or his masochistic jailbait squeeze Dawn.

Oliver Stone had the talent to do a skein; ""JFK"" strung its overpopulated narrative on Garrison's crusade to get to the bottom of the assassination plot.  In ""Wonderland,"" you aren't even sure whose story this is: the insufferable John Holmes?  His sanctimonious wife?  Dawn?  David Lind?  The LAPD?  Every time you get interested, the point of view shifts.

The movie's main focus is Holmes, by no coincidence the only celebrity in the scandal.  Though it's clear to most of the characters that his sole redeeming trait (never shown) is 13 inches long, Kilmer and the script fail to make this poignant or meaningful.  Their Holmes is a cipher - a groveling, back-stabbing, wannabe-pimp with no perceptible inner life.  Kilmer's attempt at ""conflict"" by periodically sobbing, ""I'm sorry, that was wrong!"" (for instance, while pimping his teen girlfriend out to Nash) only makes Holmes contemptible, and is factually wrong--the real Holmes beat Dawn until she sold her body for him, then beat her again for this ""infidelity.""  Holmes should be the axle around which the mayhem turns, but he is a pathetically blind Eye of the Storm.

So why was this thing made?  If no one in the movie cares about Holmes without his equipment, why would anyone in the movie theater?

There was an interesting tale somewhere in this muck heap, but it had less to do with the porno star than the war between Nash and the Wonderland Gang.  The contrast between the two rivals is telling, braiding threads of West vs. East, domesticity vs. solitude, innocence vs. corruption, tradition vs. modernity.  The first we see of Dan Launius, he's twirling a pair of antique cowboy pistols while whooping like a desperado.  His gang are mad-dog outlaws, too excited or too high to plan further than the next party or daring caper.  Yet Launius is married, and the group lives almost a parody of a domestic drill with breakfast nook, entertainment center, and frequent soirees.  Their scenes glow with a warmth and sociality, and hint at the Hollywood fault-line where playacting and real life get blurred.

Because these outlaws seem like innocents, cowboys who followed the Wild West's call too far and ended up dazed in 1980's L.A.  To what end?  They are domesticated but not mature, hip but not aware, jubilant but unsatisfied.

Eddie Nash seems to be living on a different planet altogether.  He is inert, meticulous, fond of lounging about his sunken rumpus room in a silk robe and a Speedo.  He too has parties, but they are conducted in an eerie darkness and informed by rigid ceremony.  This Nash is a repository for every hoary stereotype of the East, just as the Wonderland crew epitomizes the West.  He suggests an exhausted Turkish sultan, sated by drugs and women, finding release only in acts of diabolical cruelty.

His destruction of the Wonderland Gang is emblematic of the turn of the decade.  There's a maxim that you can tell everything about an American cultural moment by looking at its cars.  1970's car bodies were romantic, individualistic; by the early '80's they had turned efficient, uniform, dull.  If the '70's had a lifestyle fixation and outlaw brio, the '80's were the age of conformity, professionalism, and ruthless downsizing.  Beneath his torpor Nash is a cautious and efficient mobster.  The fact that Holmes, porno pioneer, sold out his Jesse James buddies to The Man says a lot about the decade of Michael Milken.

But Cox's script eschews psychological as well as cultural depth.  The real Dan Launius was a brutal thug suspected in 28 separate murders, a Vietnam Vet who allegedly smuggled dope in the corpses of his comrades.  The biggest mystery here is, why did this psychopath spare the lives of Nash and his bodyguard?  Any marginally hip Los Angelean knew this to be synonymous with suicide.  Dealers tend to rob other dealers because they know the cops won't be summoned, whereas murder is different.  But Nash was a real-life Keyser Soje, an Eastern Mafioso with a line of nightclubs, millions of dollars in drug connections, and a blood-feud approach to payback.  The LAPD were a basketful of kittens in comparison.

The answer seems to lie in the reality bubble drugs create, a limbo that feeds delusions and blinds users to changing times.  Launius & Co. were so busy mainlining they didn't notice they'd grown old and soft.  ""Wonderland"" hints at this in a sad moment when Launius and his wife argue over drugs, sounding weirdly like Blondie scolding Dagwood for the size of his sandwiches.  But this sparkle, like the others in the film, quickly fades.

F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" asks, what happens when you reach that golden Western shore, and have to turn back?  What's left for a race of freebooters when the frontier ends and the adventure is done?  Were you really just after the booty (as it were), or was there a deeper meaning that got lost along the way?  For Gatsby, the answers came in a torrent of blood.  ""Wonderland"" seems to take the same path, but gets lost in a swamp of bad casting, pretentious narrative, and sleazy shallowness.  It promises meaning, then burns its customers.  At least straight horror flicks like ""Halloween"" didn't get our hopes up.",1212969600,17,8998,4.9072847682119205
1970506,3,B00014K58W,"True life crime stories based on real events often make for a compelling and yet disturbing experience. Such was the case years ago when television viewers first experienced the horror that was HELTER SKELTER. That movie came to mind while I was watching this one. I was horrified at the story unfolding before me, but felt that I had to watch at the same time.

Don't let the hype be the only thing to draw you in here. Most publicity focuses on the fact that porn star John Holmes was involved in the murders that took place on Wonderland Avenue. But the story is so much more than that.

In the summer of 1981, four people were brutally murdered on Wonderland Avenue. Another victim survived. The truth of what happened there has been pieced together and charges filed, but the results of those charges and trials were far from satisfying to the public.

The movie takes the tact of telling the same story from various points of view, beginning with that of Dawn (Kate Bosworth), the current girlfriend of John Holmes (Val Kilmer). An addict just as Holmes was, her focus is on the next fix and the attention that Holmes showers on her when he can see straight. She is young and in love and that is all that matters. What is actually happening around her is only caught in glimpses.

The second set up is seen through the eyes of a biker hoodlum named David Lind (an almost unrecognizable Dylan McDermott). Lind was not at the scene of the crime when it took place, but claims to know what went on to cause the events to unfold. His take revolves around Holmes being the center of the storm, the whole person responsible for the murders. Of course, his girlfriend was one of the victims and he has a grudge to bear.

The last full look at the crime comes through the eyes of Holmes' himself. As portrayed by Kilmer, Holmes' is actually a sad character, filled with insecurities and unsure of himself, relying on the small amount of celebrity status he has yet embarrassed by it at the same time. He looks at the world around him as a group that takes advantage of him while the viewer sees up close the user that he was, using drugs and people to get whatever it was he needed.

The film ends with a tie up of all of the stories and viewpoints that give us a possibility of what truly happened. This version includes information all parties concerned haven't given to the police via Holmes' wife Sharon (Lisa Kudrow). What happened that night at Wonderland affected her as well, even though for all purposes she and Holmes' were separated.

What makes this film one to watch is the raw look at what went on behind the scenes there in Hollywood. No look at the glitz and glamour, no look at the world of pornography, but a look at the seedier side, the low level criminals and how the operated, what they were interested in. It looks at how people involved with one another, offer no amount of loyalty to one another, always looking out for number one.

And perhaps the most simple of the reasons we watch is that innate sense of wonder that we all share, rubbernecking as we drive by an accident, afraid of the gory details, yet for some reason compelled to look. And in that sense, we are offered a glimpse into the world of Wonderland and what happened.

My expectations for this film were to find one that relied on the sensational image of John Holmes and not on the events of that summer evening. Instead I was given a solid film that told the story of a night filled with murder and what paved the way for that event. And in that story is a chilling tail that deserves to be watched.",1205539200,5,3592,4.4385432473444615

This is an ugly story of drugs, sex, and blackmail that revolves around the totally unattractive but well-endowed  porn king John Holmes (Kilmer, in a dizzying performance). The supporting players range from a tattooed and over-the-top Dylan McDermott to Josh Lucas and Eric Bogosian doing their standard sleazy guy routine.

1970509,4,B00014K58W,"I saw this movie in the theatre, and liked it, but not as much as re-watching it on dvd.  Seeing it a second time made me really appreciate the decent story that was woven by this tale. John Holmes (AKA Jonny Wadd) was a legend in the adult film industry. This is the tale of how the mighty have fallen.  The story is what Boogie Nights is loosly based on, which is also one of my favorite movies.  I was impressed by the performance by dillon mcdermott and val kilmer, and the overall cinematography of this film.
  The real treasure of this edition is the ""WADD"" feature on the second disc, an almost two hour documetary of the life of John Holmes with his wife, his girlfriend, and many of the actresses that he had involvment with over the years.  Very well made with people who viewed his life from both sides. I highly recommend viewing this movie if you like historical drama and liked boogie nights.",1197849600,,907,4.401197604790419

Val Kilmer is a longtime favorite of mine and delivers a great, effortless performance as an addicted, sad and confused man at his wit's end who (unwittingly?) gets involved in an impossible situation that spirals out of control and ends in murder. Of particular note in this film are; Josh Lucas as a crazed drug fiend who lights up the screen every time he appears, Dylan McDermott as David Lind whose version of the Wonderland caper we hear first(the version I believe)and Lisa Kudrow as Sharon Holmes who at first, seems to underplay her role but in later scenes reveals layers of hurt, resentment and inner strength that break your heart. ""Wonderland"" is a jolting, fast-paced film that will repel some viewers with it's violence, coarse language and overall air of sorrow, after a while you are truly disgusted by and feel sorry for these people and the sad state of thier lives.

First account given is poor and unconvincing, and villians are not well established.
Great timeline technique showing Holmes' girlfriend wating impatiently through a TV guide.

1970512,4,B00014K58W,"I bought this movie in a bin at Wal-Mart for $5.50. I had never heard of this movie, nor of the true story of the Wonderland Murders that is was based upon, and I had no clue who John Holmes was. So on that note, I went into this movie without any preconceived thoughts on what this film should be like. With that said, I must say I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. Val Kilmer delivers a decent performance, though, to me, him, along with his ""buddies"" that wind up murdered, seem a bit over the top characters as far as junkies go. But the overall story is good in my opinion. No, this story does not have anything to do with John Holmes - the porn star. And this isn't some biography film strictly about John Holmes. And though it does explain some back story on Holmes' life, the film still mainly revolves around the murders. Like I said, Kilmer does a decent job portraying Holmes, and Lisa Kudrow gives a good performance as Holmes' estranged wife. As far as bonus features, Disc 1 has the usual stuff, like Deleted Scenes, Director's Commentary, and interview clips. But what I couldn't believe was that also included on this disc was actual police video footage of a walk-through of the Wonderland residence after the murders took place. This footage shows everything, blood stains and splatters everywhere, and even the bodies of the victims. I can't believe that this stuff could be put on DVD and sold to the public. Needless to say, this is a very interesting and shocking special feature. Disc 2 is also very good, with an hour and half in depth look at the entire life of John Holmes. It includes interviews of his 2 former wives, his girlfriend, and people who knew him throughout the porn film industry. If you've not familiar with John Holmes, it's definitely worth watching. All in all, I think this is a pretty good film, and the special features definitely make it worth buying, especially at this price.",1190073600,3,1923,4.544668587896253
1970514,3,B00014K58W,"The life and times of John Holmes defines public perception of the adult entertainment industry. You occasionally come across an article or two nowadays talking about how its merely a business and its practitioners are really just entrepreneurs, how only a select few engage in the types of behavior exhibited by Holmes back in the 1970s and 1980s. What was that behavior? You already know. Think about your perceptions of the adult film industry. It's loaded from top to bottom with strung out junkies, misogynists, and women abused as children now taking their internal pain out on themselves. Producers and distributors don't escape scorn, either. They're abusers of female flesh always looking for the next buck, always looking out for some fresh perversion to put up on the screen in order to lure in customers. Drugs, anti-feminists, abusers, predators--not a pretty picture. John Holmes fit the bill when it came to drugs and other assorted criminal enterprises. After his career in the business faded, he sank into a personal hell of cocaine and heroin addiction. His death from the AIDS virus in 1988 only confirmed what many already thought about this sordid and seamy lifestyle.

""Wonderland"" touches on one of the sleazier parts in John Holmes's long slide into oblivion. As we soon learn from the film, a heinous crime occurred in a known drug den located in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles. On July 1, 1981, someone or several someones broke into the house and severely bludgeoned all five occupants with steel pipes. Four of them died. The fifth victim, a woman, survived with serious injuries. A police investigation into the crime discovered that nearly everyone associated with the house was deeply involved in drugs. Then an informant named David Lind contacted the authorities. He told a strange story about the former film star John Holmes. According to Lind, Holmes frequented the drug parlor on a regular basis and was actually in the house the night of the murders. Moreover, he helped the gang in the house plan a drug robbery involving a big time cocaine dealer named Eddie Nash. Holmes helped eyeball Eddie's pad and then gave the information to his friends. They robbed the drug dealer, but Nash found out who was responsible and retaliated by putting out a hit on the residents of the house. When the police finally caught up with John Holmes, he offered up a different version of events.

The movie ""Wonderland"" presents to its audience both accounts of what happened in the house that night. Before we get to the good stuff, the film sets up the story. Holmes (Val Kilmer) spends all of his time with his underage girlfriend Dawn (Kate Bosworth) trying to score dope. Oddly enough, he still maintains contact with his estranged ex-wife Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), which often leads to very strange scenes when Holmes shows up with his girlfriend. Sharon will eventually play a small, albeit important, role in what happens later. Then ""Wonderland"" treats us to endless scenes of drug dealing and drug using at the house. It's fairly clear in at least one of the film's narratives that Holmes isn't well respected by the gang living in the house. They think he's a mooch and a loser whose only worth to them is one of cruel entertainment. For example, he's forced to show a couple of girls his...equipment...much to the amusement of the others. It's hard to see this pathetic loser actively participating in a series of brutal murders. According to David Lind (Dylan McDermott), however, that's exactly what happened. Holmes was not only there; he actively participated in the killings.

I think that summary pretty much nails it, although I wouldn't bet any money on it. That's the main problem with ""Wonderland"". The narrative style of the film incorporates at least two versions of events, and these stories move around in odd circles that make it tough for a viewer to keep track of the proceedings. Did Eddie Nash force Holmes to roll over on his friends? Or did Holmes decide to rat them out for his own personal gain? That's the crux of the story. We don't receive a definitive answer in the movie largely because the legal system never solved the case. Don't worry about the confusing plot, though, because the film does a good job of looking at the sordid underside of life in Los Angeles. The set pieces look great, and the performances work wonders. I wasn't that impressed with Val Kilmer as the main character; he's done much better work in other films, and he doesn't seem to have much to do here. Lisa Kudrow spellbinds in her small role, and Eric Bogosian exudes menace as the dangerous Eddie Nash. Look for appearances from Christina Applegate, Carrie Fischer, and Janeane Garofalo in smaller parts.

We've got a big slab of DVD to dissect here, folks. ""Wonderland"" as a two-disc set boasts a ton of supplements that will keep you busy LONG after the credits roll. You want a commentary track? We get one with director James Cox and some dude named Captain Mauzner. We also get deleted scenes, lots of short interviews with the cast, a brief Court TV segment dealing with the case, and trailers. The best extras are a long documentary on the life of John Holmes and a grisly 24 minute long LAPD crime video showing the inside of the house after the murders. We see the bodies and the blood splatter in nauseating detail, and it's nasty stuff. Keep that in mind if you've got a weak stomach. Ultimately, I'm going to give ""Wonderland"" three stars. I thought the film was only so-so. It's definitely not Kilmer's finest hour. Also, I don't really care much about the deaths of a bunch of low-life scumbags. Sue me.

As told through the eyes of two men, Holmes being one and the other being former business partner David Lind (McDermott) who lost his girlfriend Barbara (Wagner) in this quadruple homicide that took the lives of drug dealer Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Billy Deverell (Nelson), Joy Miller (Gerofalo) and Barbara as well as injuring Ron's wife Susan (Applegate).  These people were beaten to death with pipes, which is pretty graphically reenacted in this film so beware...

The film explores Holmes involvement in the crime, but more interesting it delves into his personal life at the time of the murders, showing his relationships with both his underage girlfriend Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth) and his wife Sharon (Kudrow) as well as exploring his relationships with the deceased.  The acting overall is what saves this movie for me, for we really get to see these people for who they were, or at least how others saw them.  Getting to hear the same story two ways helps us to understand different ones perspective of the situation but it's seeing their eyes that helps us decide who's lying...or maybe they both are.

Being freakishly ""gifted"" as a male, the adult-film industry suited Holmes quite well, giving him unlimited access to drugs and women.

With his underage girlfriend Dawn (Kate Bosworth) and unsavory friends, Holmes and his group of cohorts go after what they believe to be an easy money scheme, but wind out picking the wrong victim.  Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), owner of the Starwood, was once said to have left forty acres of skulls with the teeth removed in his wake.  Eddie Nash wasn't the type of man you hit with burglary.

The movie is interesting because it is literally told from two separate points of view.  First from David Lind (played by Dylan McDermott) telling his version of the story which incriminates Johnny.  But when he is cornered, Johnny tells a different tale, insisting on his innocence.

The incredible acting from Val Kilmar, a stunning performance by Lisa Kudrow as Susan Holmes, and amazing supporting roles from Christina Applegate, Kate Bosworth, Carrie Fisher, Janeane Garafalo, Josh Lucas, and Michael Pitt lend excitement and credibility to the Wonderland murders account.  And yes, that's nasty little Paris Hilton as Barbie on Nash's boat.

This is the story of

(Opening frame of <em>Wonderland</em>)

Welcome to the disintegrating world of John Holmes. Once a legendary porn star famous for his astonishing 14 inch penis, he hasn't worked in years and can't escape the stigma of his past. The drug habit that killed his career and squandered his fortune now threatens to consume him completely.

After exhausting his credit with every dealer in town, Holmes (Val Kilmer) is desperate to maintain his supply of drugs. Beholden to the proprietors of a drug den on Wonderland Avenue, he formulates a reckless plan that will culminate in the grisliest murders since the Tate/LaBianca killings over a decade before.

<em>Wonderland</em> offers two versions of the events leading up to the murders through a series of flashbacks from individual characters.

David Lind (Dylan McDermott) is the only resident of 8763 Wonderland left to refute Holmes' account of the days preceding the murders. Returning from out of town, he is  confronted with the news that four of his roommates have been beaten to death and another is in critical condition. Distraught over the death of his girlfriend, he angrily relates his suspicions of Holmes' involvement to the LAPD.

While Lind insists that Holmes must have set his friends up, Holmes attempts to minimize his role to the police. Painting the murder victims as inept criminals who invited their own doom, he insists he was powerless to prevent the murders. Seeming to revel in the detective's attention, he shows no sympathy for the dealers who treated him like a circus freak, forcing him to show his 14 inch appendage to strangers at gunpoint.

The most significant memories may be those of Sharon (Lisa Kudrow's strongest performance to date), Holmes' long suffering, estranged wife. She feels disgusted and betrayed by his porn career but can't bring herself to cut him out of her life completely. Her recollection of a bizarre visit from Holmes shortly after the murders provides valuable illumination on what really happened that night on Wonderland Avenue.

Excellent performances and creative editing elevate <em>Wonderland</em> from what could have been a typical exploitation movie. The two perspective mystery element is engaging enough to make you abandon your preconceptions and get engrossed in the storyline.

Special features include <em>Wadd: The Life and Times of John C. Holmes</em> (A documentary about John Holmes rise to fame in the porn industry) and a truncated version of LAPD video of the Wonderland crime scene. The crime scene video features none other than Tom Lange (LAPD detective of O.J. Simpson trial fame) and is extremely graphic and not for the weak of stomach.

One of which is a 10 minute trailer of Wonderland. Dont buy this dvd if you ever want to watch it more than once, unless you want to sit through the same 20 minute prologue every time. I hate when DVDs won't let you just jump to what you want to see, but this one actually forced me to take it out altogether.",1139875200,4,451,4.078651685393258
1970523,4,B00014K58W,"The film is very enjoyable post Natural Born Killer excercise, with fine central performance and exciting if not overly original visuals. My problem is with the historical details -- people are too pretty, and taut, for the ""hang loose"" decadence of very early 80s, hair a bit too gelled - check out Boogie Nights for the ultimate recreation of the 70s look or any late 70s/early 80s TV shows like Three's Company or even old porn :) Also, the first celluar service didn't arrive until 1983 and that was for car phones not the biga$$ Moto cell whih was marketed in the LATE 80s... anyhoo that diminished the film's impact/realism somewhat for me but not enough to make me want to turn it off.",1139097600,4,692,4.588709677419355
1970534,5,B00014K58W,"Wonderland sounded like my kind of movie. Sex, drugs, rock n' roll and murder. I've always been interested in serial killers, murders, psychos and the general CSI types of things. I couldn't have been more pleased. Despite my fascination with subjects like this, I didn't have much prior knowledge about the Wonderland murders. But to me, that didn't matter as this movie was absolutely riveting. A much darker Boogie Nights for sure. The music in Wonderland is fantastic as well, taking you back to a time when music really was music and not the cheap, plastic pop crud it tends to be now. You won't be disappointed in this movie.

Now, you might ask what could make a great movie even better? Ah, well for $9.99 at Target, I found the version of Wonderland that comes with a bonus disc. On that disc is a one hour and forty-something minutes documentary called Wadd, about the life of John Holmes. Not only do I highly recommned this movie, but I also feel the same for the documentary. Good stuff! On the first disc, with the movie Wonderland come some other great special features like deleted scenes, but the star in this section is the actual crime scene video. It's about 25 minutes long and if you love crime stuff, you will definitely want to watch it. But please keep in mind it is the ACTUAL crime scene footage. It shows in great detail the crime scene from the Wonderland murders and the bodies of those who were killed. If you have a weak stomach or this sort of thing puts you off, then you may want to skip watching that special feature. This is an incredible DVD for anyone's collection and I absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in this type of material.",1138665600,3,1680,4.562913907284768

1970536,4,B00014K58W,"Wonderland tells the tale of the 1981 murders at Wonderland Drive in a drug deal gone sour.  Legendary porn star John Holmes (played by Val Kilmer) was tied up in the crowd that committed the score.  Was he at the scene as an observer?  Did he participate in the murders?  Did he rat out the rest of the gang to save himself?  Is he trying to pull something over on the police, on his friends, or on both?  The events unfold from several different points of view, leaving the reader to interpret the conflicting accounts on their own.  Holmes comes off as a desperate slacker trying to score drugs for himself and rarely thinking of others, but it isn't clear that he's a cold-blooded killer.  Lisa Kudrow is also fantastic as Holmes's estranged wife.

Wonderland is a dark, gritty film and a fascinating character study.  Bonus items on the DVD include a documentary on Holmes (terrific!) and a gruesome LAPD crime scene video (not recommended if you have a weak stomach).",1135728000,,973,4.637426900584796
1970537,2,B00014K58W,"This movie, based on a true story, had all the elements to make it a classic but director Cox can't seem to decide if he wants to make a serious drama or long MTV movie with camera tricks that don't work. The picture is sleazy and often boring. The story of John Holmes should have produced better material than this.

Articles about John Holmes present a sleazy but fascinating picture of a porn star whose only ""redeeming"" value was his ...um... instrument. But although Wonderland shows him as a loser...it neglects some facts including how he constantly abused his teenaged lover. The love story as it's presented here doesn't evoke sympathy for the couple. The audience is more than likely to be annoyed with and irritated by them instead.

We also could have seen more character development. The Wonderland gang and Eddie Nash are not flushed out and seem cartoonish. Perhaps this is why much of the acting seems stilted. The one exception is Lisa Kudrow, as Sharon, Holmes' first wife. The story could have been improved if we understood more about their marriage.

The DVD also features a video from the actual crime scene with graphic pictures of the murder victims shown as the LAPD dispassionately collect evidence from the crime scene. For those with weak stomachs, it's gruesome and shouldn't be shown around children.

Wadd, the documentary on the real life John Holmes on the second DVD, is actually more interesting than the main feature. It includes some crucial facts that the movie neglected and presents a fuller picture. Holmes continued on his downward spiral after Wonderland's conclusion and it was not a happy end. I would recommend the documentary as more interesting.",1134691200,6,1694,4.933333333333334

1970539,2,B00014K58W,"I am going to make this review rather short and to the point, which is the absolute opposite of the movie. If you think that spending about 2 hours listening to a group of drugged-out degenerates offering conflicting, confusing, self-serving viewpoints about a brutal murder is entertaining, then by all means watch this disjointed nightmare of a movie...but please be warned:

There is no attempt to filter any of the information and it is presented with no regard to sequence or source: at times, three different viewpoints are presented almost simultaneously. You never know who is thinking what, and to be very honest, you rapidly cease to care. You cannot draw any logical conclusions, because the information you are receiving is garbled and, at times, incomprehensible. It is much like being on the jury in a trial that is presided over by a group of crack addicts....in Chinese.

If you are tempted to watch the movie due to the lurid reputation of ""porno king"" John Holmes, be advised that it is completely devoid of any real insights into that portion of his life. The movie depicts only his post-career slide into serious drug addiction and (possibly) murder, and for that reason could be about any loser. ""Boogie Nights"" portrays the full spectrum of his life in an infinitely better, more entertaining manner.

I have heard comparisons of this movie to Rashomon, which is a cruel insult to an infinitely greater movie. Yes, Rashomon presented its story through conflicting viewpoints, but each of the viewpoints is clearly presented and its source is known. The audience becomes acclimated to the characters their conflicting viewpoints, and can draw valid conclusions. Such cannot be said for this pasted-together, tangled-up assault on the senses. It is just a mess....an inkblot on a dirty canvas. If you are at all interested in a truly skillful, entertaining retelling of the ""ups and downs"" of the ""porno king"" please (for your own good) avoid this travesty and get ""Boogie Nights""....it is like comparing skid marks to a Picasso.",1128297600,7,2049,5.020588235294118
1970540,3,B00014K58W,"In the summer of 1981, four people were found dead, brutally murdered, in the apartment at Wonderland Ave., LA. Another woman was also in critical condition, unable to talk about the incident.

The LAPD started investigation, and found out the connection between the victims and one legendary porno star John Holms played by Val Kilmer.  Now John is no longer in the movie business, but is doing drugs and causing troubles with his girlfriend Dawn played by cast-against-type Kate Bosworth.  Thus 'Wonderland' wisely skips the days when John Holmes (on whose life 'Boogie Nights' is loosely based) was famous, and offers possible versions of what really happened to John Holmes when he suddenly left the motel, and came back there, terribly shocked.

[RASHOMON STYLE]  So the film does not solve the bloody murder.  Using the mouth of characters testifying before the police, 'Wonderland' offers its own plausible version(s) about what really happened to John Holmes, and the inmates of the apartment who, the film desribes, robbed a local magnate.  In whatever versions, the film shows, crimes were committed before the murder, but the film's real concern is in what way John was involved.

And in what way?  Guilty or Not Guilty?  Not exacly.  To be honest, I still don't see the point.  There are different versions, to be sure, but the frequent use of flashy cameraworks and awfully complicated narrative structure prevent us from understand how different.  Yes, they are differenct, but I couldn't see the impact of the differences because they are not presented clearly.  Some things are only suggested, but not suggestive enough forus to be intrigued.  I know, they made the film that way to avoid being sued, but it's a pity because the film has two interesting names -- the associate producers Dawn Schiller herself and consultant Sharon Holmes, wife of John.

But as far as the realistic air of the frivolous 80s, just before we face issues related to HIV, 'Wonderland' is convincing, and so is the acting.  Also, the cast is very interesting -- Val Kilmer, Kate Bosworth, Lisa Kudrow (as John's separated wife), Josh Lucas, Tim Blake Nelson, Dylan McDermott, Christina Applegate, Eric Bogosian, Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Natasha Gregson Wagner, Michael Pitt (whom I cannot remember) and even Janeane Garofalo.  And, wow ... cameo of Palis Hilton.  What can I say?

'Wonderland' conveys the feeling of belated summer of love in the 80s LA, but as to the central characters John Holmes and two women who loved him, the film shows mo more insight into their relationship than the murder itself.  But perhaps it should be so.",1127088000,3,2633,5.006896551724138
1970541,5,B00014K58W,"I was very intriqued with this film after I heard that it was being made. Unfortunatly, it went into a very limited release in theaters and was forgotten by me until I happened to see it in a local movie rental shop.

""Wonderland"" is about the Wonderland Ave Murders in Hollywood in 1981. It is also a story about the decline of a legend (John Holmes) and the horrible toll that drugs can cause. What is most shocking about the film that it was based on a true story and most of the film was accurate. These murders were about as shocking and the Sharon Tate/Manson Family Murders, but little is discussed about them. The movie guides us through the month period, both before and after the murders and gives different points of view about what might actually had happened and who was responsible for the murders. It also gives us a very shocking glimpse into drugs and it's excess and the means that some will go to feed their habits.

The film is at it's best when it tries to take us back to that time period and it's use of ""TV Guide"" pages and newspaper headlines in the backdrop when showing the timelines helps us that were alive back then to remember that summer in which the murders took place. Also, Val Kilmer does a great job in playing John Holmes and Kate Bosworth is equally as good as his teenage girlfriend, Dawn. Dylan McDermott does well in the film, as does Lisa Kudrow as Holmes estranged wife, Sharon.

Anyone expecting to see a documentary on the porn industry, this is not your movie. Go watch ""Boogie Nights"" for that. Little is mentioned about it, other than referring to John Holmes celeberity status. This is more about drugs and excess than porn.

All I can say is that it affected me in a way that no movie had since ""Seven"". Though the two movies are much different in almost every aspect, the shock I had at the end of both films were the same. Also, the LAPD Crime Scene video was one of the most shocking pieces of film I have ever seen and it should come with a disclaimer before watching it. The John Holmes documentary ""WADD"" was also very interesting and a must see.

Excellent film... go watch it!",1126051200,2,2135,4.422391857506361
1970542,3,B00014K58W,"Perhaps it's because the central mystery (what, if anything, did John Holmes have to do, DIRECTLY, with the Wonderland slayings?) is never solved, the movie has a natural hole in it.  We'd like to know, because so much of the rest of the movie feels a bit pointless.  It almost feels like it was made, or edited, by someone in a bit of a drug haze.  I think that could be effective from time to time, but the movie is too unfocused from a narrative standpoint.  We literally don't always know what's going on.

Frankly, the main reason to see this lurid movie is because we might be interested in finding out something about famed porn star John Holmes...NOT because of the murder-mystery itself.  And we certainly get to see the dark side of Holmes...the drugs and the self-delusion.  But there's no real sense of the man behind the drug-influenced behavior. And he had an interesting life, one would think.  The world of porn, however distasteful, would hold a certain grim fascination.  And his relationships with women ""in the real world,"" only hinted at here, seemed to have been quite complicated and a bit sad.

I can understand a filmmaker wishing to compact the John Holmes story into this few days that brought him unwanted ""attention"" later in his life.  But I really think the boat was missed here.  BOOGIE NIGHTS has often been referred to as a sort of semi-biography of Holmes.  I don't know how true that is...Dirk Digler (of BOOGIE NIGHTS) and Holmes each had legendary ""tools"" of their trade, but whereas Dirk comes back to his ""family"" in adult films...Holmes went in other directions, and eventually AIDS claimed his life.  There's the film.

Val Kilmer, who isn't a favorite of mine, is actually very good in the film, but the script doesn't give him a lot meat.  Lisa Kudrow and Kate Bosworth, along with a wonderfully cast-against-type Dylan McDermott are good too.  But the whole film just doesn't add up to solid entertainment.

The DVD set is excellent, however.  Disc 2 contains a full-length biography of Holmes.  It's a bit amateurish, but after seeing WONDERLAND, it makes a FANTASTIC companion piece, and if delving into the world of porn is what you wanted, this will fit that bill.  It's a very graphic documentary...but fascinating.

Other bonus materials are more about the murders themselves, and if those are of interest, you'll get plenty of ""real-life"" graphic stuff to sift through.  THIS MOVIE AND ITS BONUS MATERIALS MUST BE KEPT OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.  It is not for the faint of heart or the impressionable.

I can't recommend it terribly highly, but if even after my revue you are still interested, you probably won't be horribly disappointed in the time you'll spend.",1122940800,,2715,4.787096774193548
1970543,4,B00014K58W,"This 2003 film is also known as The Wonderland Murders, the title referring the name of the block where some real-life grizzly murders occurred in the 1980s.  At that time, an adult entertainment star known as John Holmes, was somehow involved in these murders and actually was one of the people put on trial.  Nobody was ever convicted though and the real story remains unknown.  However, the producers of this film chose to bring the story to the screen in typical Hollywood fashion.

Val Kilmer is cast as John Holmes.  When we meet him, his career is starting to fade and he is completely hooked on cocaine.  He has a teenage girlfriend played by Kate Bosworth who adores him in spite of the fact that he often disappears, does drugs all the time, and his life is a mystery.  But there is definitely chemistry between them and there are a few smoldering scenes to illustrate this.

John also has a wife, played by Lisa Kudrow, and when he is in trouble he goes running to her.  The girlfriend is known to the wife and the two women have a good relationship.  This is an interesting triangle, and because the acting is so good, this triangle really feels believable.

The rest of the plot spools out like a bunch of little boys in a childish gang war.  All the guys are drug addicts and when one group robs the other, the first group goes for revenge.  Many scenes seem like nothing but drug orgies.  Other scenes seem like nothing but violent attacks and revenge.  And, because the story is based on a real incident, the facts are purposely obscured and the conclusion is left open-ended and shaded with doubts about what really happened.

There's a feature of the DVD that includes the girlfriend, now grown up.  And some details about the trial.  John Holmes himself died a few years after the trials from AIDS.  Somehow though even though this is the stuff that soap opera's are made of, I found myself interested and must admit that I did enjoy watching this rather silly film.",1122163200,,1985,4.572237960339943
1970553,3,B00014K58W,"There are some excellent actors here, decent dialogue and good camera work.  It's just that this film is nothing more than a stylish, drawn-out rehashing of some fairly trivial murders that would probably never have been rehashed had it not involved John Holmes, the porn legend with his legendary johnson.  Unlike the far better ""Boogie Nights"" which detailed not only the porn industry but also had something of a subtext, this film is just your typical sensationalistic entertainment journalism.

Talk about bait-and-switch: this movie really doesn't tell us much about John Holmes at all, let alone the porn industry that created him.

1970554,4,B00014K58W,"I felt that this movie was unfairly bashed by newspaper critics.  I got the impression that none dared venture anything positive once a consensus had been established.

I was so curious about this affair after reading the Rolling Stone article years ago that I saw this movie when it was first released in theaters; I wanted to see if it corroborated the article.  So did it?  That's the movie:  two different versions of the heist are presented --John Holmes' and David Lind's.  It's one thing to hear a story, but something else to see it enacted.  John Holmes' version was amusing to see enacted because it made his lies obvious; some things could not have happened as he told them (ridiculous) and the audience laughed on those.  Toward the end is a chilling Roman holiday of a murder scene that I believe, all things considered, is as close to the truth as we will come.  For example, I believe it was Deverell who answered the door, and I am convinced that Holmes was there and probably coerced into participating in order to implicate him and thus prevent him from turning against Eddie again by testifying.

This two-disc set also includes omitted scenes, a Crime TV segment, and telling interviews with Sharon Holmes, Dawn Schiller, and people who knew Holmes from ""the industry.""  There are photos taken of the victims when they were alive which I found very interesting, just to see what they looked like.  The LAPD crime scene video was not as hard to take as I had expected, mostly due to the then-poor quality of video tape (it has come a long way since 1981 and this will jog your memory); three of the four just look like they're sleeping except that their hair is caked with blood.  There are also interviews with some of the actors.  I didn't know who Josh Lucas was before seeing this; his performance was outstanding.",1120521600,27,1837,4.647058823529412
1970555,4,B00014K58W,"Even with Val Kilmer being on the botttom of my list of favorite actors, I sincerely did not understand some of the bashing this movie received. It's a different (but no arrogant) movie: two versions of the Wonderland murders almost equally divided by half.

And that's exactly what happened in the real trials: the two versions were presented, Holmes was judged not guilty.

Since the beginning, the movie makes it clear that this is NOT about John Holme's career in the adult movie business. A honest decision by the producers. So, this is another ""based in real facts"" movies. Of course, there is the trouble of not a single real people presented in the movie be a likeable person at all (well, maybe Lisa Kudrow's charater... anyway, she may have changed with time, but anyone who married a guy like Holmes must have been an airhead or a complete insane person...That's why not even the character of Ann is a likeable one.)

Abyway, the movie is not judgmental at all. It tries to give you a balanced portrait of what may have happened. A very good, intelligent movie.",1118793600,5,1072,4.691489361702128

Dark and well directed, Wonderland is a mood piece, and a slice-of-life Rashomon tale rather than anything else.  It takes us into a dark corner of LA to the Wonderland gang and a small part of John Holmes' life.

(Note: Those expecting to see a biopic on John Holmes' porn career - this is NOT about that)  Nonetheless, an interesting, gripping movie.  Go take a shower after watching this.",1116892800,4,548,4.597938144329897
1970557,4,B00014K58W,"ok, i'll admit it sure helps alot to have been around hollywood during the late seventies early eighties to fully appreciate this film. nevertheless, even if you never went to the starwood and actually saw the sleaze that was running the clubs as drug fronts during the seventies / eighties coke era, i think this film gives you a REAL GODDAMNED FLAVOR of what it was like. i also don't believe you have to have some knowledge of what went down at Wonderland Avenue to appreciate this flick. but obviously if you're a rockin' rollin' type you're gonna dig this real life based tale of sleaze and murder and already be familiar with the subject matter. either way it works. sure there are no heroes here (although john holmes and his under age girlfriend do sort of ride off into the sunset at the end which is very ironic), but going into it, you should know that.

initially, i thought the casting was bad. but that was before watching the movie. i saw all these television actors listed and was a bit worried. despite my concerns, all the acting was first rate and all were appropriately scummy. the way the film is shot speeds things along and works for me. those who get confused must be confused easily.

soundtrack is also very effective with iggy, patti, roxy music, funkadelic, tery reid, joan jett, t.rex etc. not all of these artists appear on the soundtrack cd, but the songs give the movie more grit and work well with the subject matter.

1970558,2,B00014K58W,"James Cox takes what ought to be an interesting crime drama based on true-life events and creates an extremely superficial film with little character development.  The jerky sequencing of telling the story from different points of view confuses rather than illuminates the film.  Cox directed the fairly brainless ""Highway"" with Jake Gyllenhaal and Jared Leto; so this may be an improvement since the subject does have some weight.  But as a piece of story telling, the film drowns in its pretentiously sequenced screenplay and editing.

While there are few deep character portrayals, Cox does work with an excellent cast.  I was particularly amazed by Lisa Kudrow's frank and direct portrayal of Sharon Holmes.  While she has some of the quirky mannerisms that make her such an endearing comic character as Phoebe on the ""Friends"" TV sitcom, her performance is remarkably focused, delivered with bullseye precision.  We see her being emotionally torn between what was an obvious caring for her ex-husband, but equally decided that she wants nothing to do with his libertine lifestyle.  Hers really was an overlooked Oscar-caliber performance, probably overlooked because it's in such a cinematic mess.

Other supporting characters are good.  Dylan McDermott whose face became well known from ""The Practice"" TV series looks quite different and gives what is probably the deepest performance of his career as David Lind, con-guy turned informant because of the brutal death of his girlfriend.  Kate Bosworth who is becoming well-known from films like ""Blue Crush"" & ""Win A Date With Tad Hamilton"" gives a sterling performance as the emotionally fragile Dawn Shiller, the girlfriend of John Holmes.  Josh Lucas as Wonderland gang planner Ron Launius looks too nice to really be believable as the out-of-control basehead who stupidly rushes into hit the mafioso Eddie Nash.  Carrie Fisher as an evangelistic church lady and Eric Bogosian as crime master Eddie Nash add nice touches to paper-thin roles.

Val Kilmer is affecting as John Holmes.  He revels in Holmes' bravado even as he hits the gutter.  It is a layered performance from a character who uses people.  The weakness of the film is that Holmes is the main character.  We simply don't like him.  If the central character had been Kudrow and we'd seen her struggle against John, perhaps there'd be more to cheer about.  There's an old saying, ""Garbage In, Garbage Out.""  In the end, this is a sleazy picture about immoral people doing reprehensible things told confusingly.

I have seen few movies do a better job at setting the mood via lighting, camera work, and film grain.  Kilmer's performance is surprisingly stellar.

The movie is told essentially by two characters, first by Lind, also impressively acted by Dylan McDermott, and then by Holmes.  The two-sides-of-the-story plot, while by no means an original idea, is executed well, both enhancing the sense of mystery around the murders and causing multiple sways in the sympathies of the viewer towards Holmes: from arrogant bastard to compulsive liar to strung-out junkie to wrong guy at the wrong place in the wrong time.

Val Kilmer is excellent as John Holmes, he's very good at portraying true characters including Jim Morrison in the film 'The Doors' and Doc Holliday in 'Tombstone'. The rest of the cast were all true to their characters, awesome performances.

The extra features included in this DVD could stand on their own and only makes this Wonderland DVD package all the more worthwhile. The extra features on the DVD include a documentary on John Holmes, there's interviews with Holmes as well as his ex-wife and Dawn Schiller, who was his teenaged girlfriend during the time of the murders. There's a short segment about the murders, CourtTV type of clip, there's a shocking crime scene video and interviews with two of the investigators involved in the Wonderland case. They discuss a book they've written about it that's titled, 'Four on the Floor', which I've been unable to find so it must not have gone to publication yet. Dawn Schiller has also written a book that I'm anxious to read.

The film is great, all the extras are great, and to be honest, I am quite surprised to find any negative reviews.

This high-schoolish production is a 30 minute movie stretched into almost two hours. Don't waste your time; visit your local library and dig up the original story in Rolling Stone; the well-written article is rock-solid reading and worth the work to find it; the movie, however, is so bad that it isn't laughable. We wondered, ""when the heck will this thing end?!?"" Well, not soon enough.

The film drags through a boring Rasomonian loop of murder scene takes while cutting, slicing and shaking around camera angles as if they just HAD to use every snippet of stuff that was shot.

Dylan McDemott is good but unintentionally funny as a long-haired killer with a badly glued-on Fu Manchu; the fake hair doesn't bland with his real locks.

Somebody mixed in a Donnas tune over this 80's story; time warp gaff, eh?

Carrie Fisher's bit part is embarrassing.

Lisa Kudrow plays Mrs. Johnny Holmes; not bad, but all I could see was Phoebe.

Val Kilmer pulls off his portrayal of Johnny Holmes, the perennially unlikable and self-proclaimed king of porn.

This story was a bit too much for me, mainly cause it has(mostly)exessive amount of drugs being used and it got annoying but that isn't the point.  This film was pretty good.  It was cool to see Both sides of the two mens story.  Which is true?...Honestly they both had there pros and there cons.  Lets put it this way...THEY BOTH LIED at some point of the story.

The cast in this film was superb.  Especially Dawn played by that girl from the movie Blue Crush.  Lis Kudrow did an awesome job too, very convincing character.  Besides this raw, real Story on Crime and Drugs lets not forget this still happends in the world, but this time it happend to happen to John Holms.  Val Kilmer did a great job as the Porn King, acctually all the characters did a superb job.

NOTE:Now just because this is based on some porn start don't expect some graphic scenes of sexual behaviour and nudity because you ain't gettin' none in this except for one lil' sex scene which is nothing.

Besides the good acting the film was just plain good, and yeah it didn't have a wrap up ending BUT WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING.  Now if you wanna' know the real story behind the WONDERLAND murders you can GOOGLE it up on your net and find some good articles about it....The only thing I know that's true for sure is that Nash(the arabian)is YES still out there...some were in LA..Creepy isn't it..And if you don't think so, I think you should RE-watch this film.

4.0 out of 5 stars....$3.50 Well spent....

And then there are movies that you might not like by the first time but then if you give it another try then you will start loving it. And then you have to watch it more than a dozen times because you love that movie so much. Well, Wonderland is that type of movie. First time I watched this movie I was confused and could not get the plot right but then the second time I started getting the plot. Now I LOVE THIS MOVIE ! First of all the story is about the Laurel Canyon Murder but also the Wonderland murder. To this day there are two versions of the story what really happened in the house on the Wonderland Avenue up on the Hollywood hills. The plot is unique especially considering that is based on true events and just because of this reason everyone should watch this movie. Then we have the amazing acting of Val Kilmer, Kate Bosworth, Joshua Lucas, and Lisa Kudrow and ofcourse we should not forget about Eric Bogosian as Eddie Nash who was ""the prince of darkness"" in the underground world. All these guys do an AWESOME work. You just feel what they are going through during the movie. In addition we have the amazing work of James Cox, the director. The cutscenes, editting, and camera work is so well done that makes this movie even a much better one. Then we have the GREAT soundtrack that adds the spice to this movie. But there is another better reason why this movie is so unique. The reality is that there are people like (maybe not as unique as John Holmes) these guys in real life. There are guys outthere who go through the same thing. I quote ""You want to get out of life but life is too f.. good to get out"". This movie is SO WELL DONE THAT I COULD NEVER STOP SAYING GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT! Should you decide to buy or watch this movie (which I highly recommand) then be prepared!

1970569,3,B00014K58W,"The central figure of James Cox's ""Wonderland"" is John Holmes, the man who became known the world over as the ""King of Porn"" in the 1970's and who died of AIDS in 1988 at the age of 43.  Holmes, who went by the appellation ""Johnny Wadd,"" made over 2,000 sex flicks and claimed to have bedded more than 10,000 women.  Strangely enough, however, the film is not all that interested in that aspect of his life but, instead, focuses on his involvement with the drug trade and a sensational multiple homicide that rocked Southern California in the summer of 1981, years after he had stopped making movies.  One of the theories was that Holmes had fingered some of his drug buddies for a revenge killing after they cheated him out of his share of the loot from a heist that he himself organized.  Since the case was never successfully solved, the truth, as it plays out in the movie, is left to the eye of the beholder.

The film achieves this sense of ambiguity through both its structure and its style.  Taking a ""Rashomon""-type approach to the story, the script provides us with separate and often conflicting accounts of the murders as seen through the eyes of two of the key players, Holmes and a psycho biker named David Lind.  Cox uses jump cuts, flashy editing techniques and speeded-up motion to capture the fragmentary, fractured and hallucinatory quality of a world in which drug addiction and crime are everyday occurrences and in which just about anyone could be guilty of manslaughter or even cold-blooded murder if the price is right.  In fact, there is always so much visual commotion taking place that - despite the fact that we cannot take our eyes off the screen - the main characters tend to get lost in the shuffle of fancy directorial footwork and narrative complexity.  When the film is over, we don't feel as if we know anything more about Holmes than we did before it started.  He remains pretty much a blank figure all the way through the film.  ""Wonderland"" does a thorough job conveying the essence of the seedy underbelly of L.A. life, but that is something we have encountered numerous times on film before.  In all honesty, the movie would probably have been more interesting had it concentrated on Holmes' true claim to fame - his porn career - instead of this less notable footnote to his abbreviated life.  That way, although the movie would have risked comparisons to the much better ""Boogie Nights,"" we, at least, might have gotten a sense of who Holmes really was.

Actually, of the actors, it is those in supporting roles who generate the most impact on the viewer.  Lisa Kudrow as Holmes' bitter, longsuffering wife; Kate Bosworth as his clinging, drug-addled girlfriend; and Dylan McDermott as Lind, the star witness against Holmes' in the trial that ensued, all deliver first rate performances.  As Holmes, Val Kilmer fails to go much beyond the surface aspects of the character, rarely allowing us to see the spiritual and emotional torment taking place deep inside Holmes' soul.

Yet, despite the reservations one might have about the film, ""Wonderland"" is ultimately worth watching for its storyline and the fascinating glimpse it affords into this bizarre piece of pop culture history.  We may not learn much about Holmes as a person, but we find ourselves drawn into his tale anyway.  ""Wonderland"" may not be very deep, but it sure is interesting to watch.",1102809600,5,3396,4.774358974358974

1970571,3,B00014K58W,"This movie exposes the events surrounding the brutal murders of four people on Wonderland Drive in 1981 bringing insight into a mystery never quite solved.

John Holmes (Val Kilmer) made a name for himself and his ""member"" during the 70's as a popular porn star but the excess he lived with only served him poorly in the end. In this film we meet Holmes as an aged drug addict with no real ambition or future other than staying in drugs and trouble. He has left his wife (Lisa Kudrow) and carts around a teenage girl (Kate Bosworth) using her for his drug induced whims along the way. Holmes exists between two powerful parallels where gangs and drugs control emotion and the apparently the ability to remain alive. Several different versions of the notorious night in 1981 are told and a straight answer is never really divulged making it seem possible that the actual murders of Wonderland were never completely solvable.

This movie is dark and filmed in a very gritty and up close and personal way by director James Cox. At the forefront Val Kilmer plays Holmes as a drugged up loser who exists in a world of excess, using everyone around him for a moment of induced mindfulness. Kilmer, always great, is dreadful in this role bringing the soiled selfishness of the real Holmes to new life. As his wife Lisa Kudrow exposes herself to the lens as an older, less attractive version of herself but holds her own against Kilmer. Kate Bosworth is the trusting teenage Dawn who ran about with Holmes without understanding her real predicament. Dylan McDermott pulls off a less than attractive role as a tough gangster willing to expose the events of Wonderland to detectives searching for answers. The movie is interesting because it shows how difficult piecing a puzzle together can be when your only answers come from untrustworthy characters. The life of Holmes isn't something to celebrate necessarily but exposing his life as a tragic piece of excess may lead to a better understanding of a world most of us would prefer not to delve into.

1970573,4,B00014K58W,"Wonderland (James Cox, 2003)

A couple of weeks ago, I mentioned in the review of Suspect Zero a reviwer for another publication who had described the movie as ""physically hideous."" To be blunt, that may have been the single dumbest  comment I'd ever read in a movie review, as applied to the relatively benign Suspect Zero (a film which lacked even as many curl-up-and-mewl-softly moments as The Silence of the Lambs). Having seen Wonderland over the weekend, however, I can't think of a more apt description for it. I rush to add that in the case of Wonderland, ""physically hideous"" is a high compliment.

Wonderland may be the most maligned movie to come out so far this decade. I have read some of the most scathing reviews ever written on this movie, things that make Mike Nelson and Roger Ebert's attacks on the true underbelly of the film world look like Univision's review of Battlefield Earth (which I think was the only good review Battlefield Earth ever got). For the record, Ebert (who gave the movie a two-star review) voiced much the same complaint as many of the other reviews: he couldn't figure out what was going on. I don't know if the majesty of seeing this movie on the big screen made it harder to understand, or whether people just weren't paying attention, but I didn't have of the continuity problems others did. There were a couple of times where I couldn't place a particular character, but all were resolved within a minute or two.

For those not up on their porn-star history (and there is a fine deconstruction of the whole mess at Luke Ford's website, which may be the most literate porn site on the web), John Holmes was, in some way, connected to the 1981 Wonderland murders. The five victims of the murders (four deaths, one surviving with permanent brain damage) had recently robbed Eddie Nash, one of LA's underground kingpins. To this day, no one is sure of the whole truth of what happened, so it's pretty obvious that any factually-based account is going to have some unanswered questions. Cox and his co-writers do attempt a definitive account based on the testimony of Holmes' widow (who served as a consultant on the film, along with Holmes' longtime girlfriend Dawn Schiller) and a synthesis of the conflicting stories given by two of the principals, but there are still questions. No one seemed to have a problem with it in the Aileen Wuornos documentaries. Why they do here is, well, another unanswered question.

Cox's hyperkinetic style also draws a good deal of criticism, even from those familiar with his direct-to-video feature-length debut Highway, shot in much the same way. But, let's face it, most of the characters here are coke fiends. What better method of filmmaking?

While the cast itself is often cited as the only good ting about the movie, Cox's portrayals of them are often criticized. Funny, that. To me, a good makeup job combined with a few changes in one's appearance so I can't recognize a big actor is a GOOD thing. In this film, Dylan McDermott is completely unrecognizable. I like that in a movie. Val Kilmer could never be mistaken for anyone else, but he's so in the role (Kilmer, who lives and dies by Stanislavsky, was said to be so unlikeable during the shoot that many of his co-workers were constantly uncomfortable around him) that you forget this guy was, well, Madmartigan. Lisa Kudrow gives, by a mile, the performance of her career; Kate Bosworth is a long, long way from Blue Crush and Win a Date with Tad Hamilton! here. And the list goes on, way on (Natasha Gregson Wagner, Ted Levine, Josh Lucas, Janeane Garofalo, Paris Hilton, Eric Bogosian, Faison Love, Tim Blake Nelson, Christina Applegate... you get the idea.) In fact, it's not only Kudrow. Of the bunch, Kilmer (in Tombstone and, arguably, Heat), Garofalo (whose role here is too small to really give her comparison), Ted Levine (in The Silence of the Lambs, natch), and Michael Pitt (in Bully) haven't turned in performances that outshine anything they've done previously.

The story itself is complex, unsolvable, and told from different perspectives in flashback (the movie is often compared, unfavorably, to Rashomon), but pay attention and you'll figure it out. As long as you do that, it's entirely possible that Wonderland will end up being one of the best films you see this year. ****",1095120000,14,4340,4.809651474530831
1970574,3,B00014K58W,"I had higher hopes for this film, especially after the bungled treatment this true story got in BOOGIE NIGHTS.

I'd read an outstanding article in Rolling Stone some years ago about porn king John Holmes and thought that would make an excellent movie.  (Obviously the WONDERLAND filmmakers had read it too since the opening of the article--Holmes starting his ""career"" by measuring himself in the bathroom--makes it into the script).

There was so much behind the image: Holmes was not flown all over world and living in luxury (""the toast of Europe!"") as a porn superstar--he was living on the beach, breaking into cars and pimping his teenage girlfriend for drug money.  His descent into the netherworld of porn and drugs led him into 300 (!) gay porn films in the 1980's where he probably picked up the AIDS virus.  He died demented and penniless in a V.A. hospital, still hounded by the detectives trying to solve the Wonderland murders.

WONDERLAND avoids going into much of that life, instead replaying the crimes from different perspectives.

Holmes' life in itself could have been a dark, fascinating movie, but instead he's just another twitching junkie in WONDERLAND (or the RAGING BULL knock-off in BOOGIE NIGHTS, for that matter).  Val Kilmer does an excellent job but he disappears too many times from the movie.

By the time WONDERLAND ends, you're still unsure of what exactly happened that July of 1981 on Wonderland Avenue.

But whether you found out what did or did not happen, you still arrive at same conclusion: some scumbag dopeheads killed some other scumbag dopeheads.

1970575,5,B00014K58W,"John Holmes who, as a detective in the movie describes as, ""a mile worth of d--k but no balls,"" is at the center of the murders of four people on Wonderland Avenue. Its a true story, but the only problem is finding out just what role Holmes (convincingly played by Val Kilmer) had in all this blood and gore. THe movie offers a number of scenarios, but in all of them one thing is clear; John Holmes, the kind of porn stars, was just as sick and sordid as many of the other people in Los Angeles. On the screen they exhibit characteristics that generate envy among the insecure populace; but their private lives, stripped of its pomp and rather impious ceremony, is nothing more than daily wastes of skin, blood and bone. Holmes comes across, for the most part, as a coward and as someone who is so hooked on cocaine and crack that he can't see straight half the time. You will remember that he died of AIDS in 1988. But despite the moralizing, this is an interesting movie from beginning to end, and it is made all the more interesting by the fact that other people, not Holmes it seems, were more caught up and mesmerized by his sexual endowments, going to far as to ask (or order)him to ""see it."" There has not been a movie like this one, because this one is based on incidents that actually took place.

1970576,5,B00014K58W,"I appreciate the guts of the producers of WONDERLAND to bankroll this movie, since it is not the kind of mainstream stuff Hollywood usually finances these days. Almost all of the characters are sleazy scumbags, drug addicts and criminals. The main character is porn's first superstar John C. HOLMES (convincingly played by Val KILMER)at the end of his career, a pathetic loser, manipulative, pimping his young girlfriend and due to his drug habits hanging out with the wrong guys.

It is a bit tricky to give a brief plot synopsis for this one without giving too much away, but I'll try it anyway.

WONDERLAND is a true crime story about the horrifying murders that occured on July 1st, 1981 in a house on Wonderland avenue in LA and left four people dead and one woman seriously injured. The victims were beaten to death with lead pipes. One of the residents, who was not present at the time the killings occurred, turns himself in to the police and tells the cops a story involving drugs, the robbery of a nightclub owner named Eddie NASH (terrific performance by Eric BOGOSIAN) and XXX movie star John C. HOLMES. Questioned by the cops, HOLMES gives his version of the story. Needless to say it is very different...

I won't tell more about the plot, just add that it is terrific.

All actors deliver powerhouse performances. Aside from KILMER and BOGOSIAN, I particularly liked Josh LUCAS as criminal Ron LAUNIUS. The movie is also exceptionally well shot. I also like to give kudos to the scriptwriters for their efforts.

The DVD also has great extra features. There are some brief interviews with actors Val KILMER, Josh LUCAS, Eric BOGOSIAN and Tim BLAKE-NELSON. There are seven brief deleted scenes, but none would have added much to the film had they been included. Another extra is a photo gallery, but it is nothing to write home about. Then there is a short documentary about the Wonderland-murders called COURT TV: HOLLYWOOD AT LARGE. As a true crime fan my favorite among the extras is the 20 minute original crime scene video from the LAPD. We see the horrifying crime scene, while a homicide detective comments (""We are now in the residence, the first level living room area, wherein the first victim was found. Apparent bloodsplatterings are evident on the walls and on the sofa located on the west wall of the living room."") Not for the squeamish!

The second DVD contains a feature-length documentary about John C. HOLMES, titled WADD. THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JOHN C. HOLMES. There are lots of interviews with XXX stars (Annette HAVEN, Kitten NATIVIDAD,...) and snippets from HOLMES films. (Note that it is the R-rated cut of the documentary, so the included scenes from HOLMES films are softcore.) Suffice to say, the documentary (as well as the WONDERLAND main feature) are not for the easily offended.

All of this excess is spiced with frenetic quick-cut editing in order to create the drug high of freebasing for three straight days. I liked ""Wonderland,"" but then again I have a morbid fascination with crime. The story plays out in a he-said-she-said, ""Rashomon""-like fashion confusing more than aiding. Three versions of this story are shown, so the viewer can decide for themselves. Director James Cox has gone to great lengths to make a stylish film about the most unsettling cretins in Hollywood history.
""Wonderland"" is a true story that happened in 1981. Four people are found brutally murdered in a house on Wonderland Avenue, pounded by lead pipes and a baseball bat or two. Johnny C. Holmes, one of the most famous porn stars in history, is a prime suspect. The Wonderland house was a drug den, and Johnny who hadn't made a film in two years, hung around often. Investigators haul Holmes in and get a convoluted story detailing robbery, double cross and dope. It appears the Wonderland victims had robbed the home of Eddie Nash, Los Angeles nightclub owner and drug king. Nash suspected Holmes was involved, and forced the weaselly drug addict to lead his own goons over to the Wonderland house to exact revenge.
Everyone in this film is sleazy, and it's surprising such a strong cast to include Kilmer, Dylan McDermott, Lisa Kudrow, Josh Lucas, Kate Bosworth, Jeneane Garofalo, Carrie Fisher and Christina Applegate would take on such shady roles. The performances are uniformly good, though a lot of fine actors disappear in the shadows of communion dope smoke and coke snort. Some of the best scenes in ""Wonderland"" are when Kilmer (as Holmes) is figuratively flogging himself for the unparalleled loser he's become. He repeats over and over, ""Please forgive me. I'm sorry. Please forgive me."" But you will have to look quick to see this great scene because Cox, in obsessive MTV fashion, cuts away as quickly as possible. We eventually see the entire scene, only in snip-snip pieces, inter cut with Holmes' girlfriend sleeping with another man.
If you pick up the ""Wonderland"" DVD, you have a lovely little extra which is the actual LAPD crime scene video taken at the scene. In all its crimson, hand-held glory, you can see the infamous Wonderland pad, complete with close-ups of the dead kids. I turned it off quickly, and am frankly stunned such an insensitive extra would be included. Dope dealers and criminals granted, but these kids deserve a bit more respect than to have their indecent murders serve as an extra on a DVD.
There's not much character development in ""Wonderland,"" and motivation is about as thin as a sheet of recycled toilet paper. Brief stardom and falls from porn grace have been brilliantly documented in Paul Thomas Anderson's 1997 film ""Boogie Nights."" In fact, Dirk Diggler was based on Johnny Holmes. The robbery of Eddie Nash was covered in the unforgettable scene where Alfred Molina dances around to Night Ranger in sweaty speedos. I suppose ""Wonderland"" is the seedy next-day truth to ""Boogie Nights,"" as Diggler-er-Holmes is forced to go to Wonderland Avenue and pound out a bloody revenge against his friends. To ""Wonderland's"" credit, we never see Holmes' member. He is forced to pull it out at one point - away from camera view - for party guests.
""Wonderland"" accurately portrays a horrible crime and the days leading up to its resolution. Like watching a crime scene video, you'll find yourself wanting to look away. But like the party-goers staring wide-eyed at Johnny's infamous member, you won't.",1088035200,7,3723,4.996779388083736

It truly does not succeed on any level.  John Holmes is the ""star"" of the film, but he is the least interesting and most two-dimensional character here.  I did not find myself engaged in the story or caring about any of these characters.  An attempt at tension or dramatic suspense just fizzled for me.
What is of interest here are the extras on the DVD, including an unbelievably graphic and grisly crime scene video.  Now that was engaging...  There is also an interview with Dawn Schiller, Holmes' then teenage girlfriend.  Even though she seems to be cashing in on her connection to the story, it is always interesting to hear from the real people.

That fascinating movie isn't here, though. For some reason, director James Cox decides to bury the screenplay under a mish-mash of MTV camera tricks, hyper-fast editing, and distracting CGI effects (like newspaper photos coming to life, etc.) Only once or twice does he slow down and just let the actors do their thing, and its those scenes that are the most remarkable, especially the riveting and emotionally complex scene where Holmes bullys, coaxes, sweet-talks, and beats his girlfriend into pimping for him. Another highlight is a confrontation between Holmes and his estranged wife played by Lisa Kudrow, where you see 15 years of marriage summed up in a few minutes of vicious arguing.

Director James Cox allows the viewer to see the events unfold through different perspectives before leaving the decision up to the viewer as to whose story to trust.  What makes Wonderland unique is that it doesn't deal with Holmes' career, it deals with his life when his career seemed to be on the downhill and his drug raddled involvment with the people associated with the crime.  Kilmer is solid as Holmes, while the standout performances go to Lisa Kudrow as Holmes' estranged wife and Josh Lucas as an ill-fated drug peddler.

If this film is said to have done one thing, let it be said to have not had any biased lookout on events. You see every person's account and you see stuff as it happened. Holmes and most every living person got off very easy and he and his woman driving off into the sunset for Florida really happened so as for what you are ""supposed to feel"" is up to each individual's perception. The DVD contains great extra features and the real crime scene footage. The movie also sports a great soundtrack featuring Iggy Pop and the Cars to name but a few.

1970587,2,B00014K58W,"Val Kilmer has played a variation of the John Holmes persona - strung out, teetering, past all kinds of primes - for half of his career, so it makes sense he plays the man in ""Wonderland,"" a ""Rashomon""-style retelling of the brutal 1981 murders in Laurel Canyon to which porn star Holmes is forever linked.
Writer/director James Cox fashions a straight police procedural, fixated on the murder of drug addicts like it's a Tuesday night cop drama. Consider that the climax of the picture involves Ted Levine and M.C. Gainey, of all the pairs, hashing out their theories on the crime, and you begin to understand the characters serve as pawns in Cox's conspiracy theory flick.
Though it took years to put anyone in jail, the court of public opinion knew at the time that the victims at Wonderland Avenue were drug addicts and second-rate crooks who, with help from Holmes, stole a pile of drugs and money from nightclub owner/gangster Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian). Nash ordered their deaths execution-style. Of the thieves only David Lind (Dylan McDermott) wasn't at the apartment; he initially fingered the coke-addicted Holmes for the crime, and the first half of ""Wonderland"" is, essentially, his testimony. Holmes rebuts in the second half, and it's striking to see how little of a difference resides in their stories.
The question was this: Was Holmes forced to show Nash's gangsters the hideout after Nash discovered Holmes's role in the robbery? Or did Holmes willfully lead the hitmen to their prey, then participate in the crime?
Padded around these interviews are small details of Holmes's life, including the odd arrangement where he remains estranged-yet-married to a woman entirely outside his scene, Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), while living with a nubile, teen surfer girl Dawn (Kate Bosworth). The best scenes of ""Wonderland"" are Kudrow's, where she calls her husband's every bluff and kindly warns Dawn of the trouble to come. Dawn, strung out and turned out by Holmes, is a good change of pace for Bosworth, a smart, genial actress who alternates vulnerability, nurturing and extreme stupidity in this role with some skill.
Kilmer, shaggy, bloodshot, alternating between mumbling and manic, convincing in his interview, delves deep into Holmes, but Cox breaks the performance into a series of flashbacks and reenactments, filtered through the lens of two different recollections. Which performance do we trust? The real center of ""Wonderland,"" when he's onscreen, is Josh Lucas as Ron Launius, the guts and bravado of the robbery. A paranoid bully with charm and ambition, Launius likes to shame Holmes, and maybe short Holmes his take of the cash and drugs. His performance is reminiscent of Thomas Jane's work in ""Boogie Nights.""
In fact, ""Wonderland"" aspires to the entirety of ""Boogie Nights,"" - which is itself is a riff off of Holmes's life - with its close-ups of newspaper headlines and attempt at PT Anderson's camera virtuosity. But there is no sly humor in this movie or, for anyone remotely familiar with the crime and its various trials, mystery.",1082851200,2,3066,5.073267326732673

I've spent plenty of hours watching those tv specials based on real life crime drama, so of course, I really enjoyed this movie.  One of the interesting aspects of it was that the story was told, and done quite well for that matter, from two different perspectives.
One note, for those that might care, this movie, while based on a porno star, isn't about that industry (it bares no resemblance to ""Boogie Nights"" in other words).  The famous adult movie star was also a drug addict and his involvement in drugs and crime lead him to him getting caught up in a gruesome quadruple murder.  Val Kilmer's acting was very superior in this film as well, he's hardly recognizable as the normal ""action"" actor.
Now, as to whether it's worth owning or not.  It's a hard call here.  The movie is pretty gruesome and in some parts very violent.  There is a lot of cussing, yelling and drug use so it's not a ""fun to watch"" action/adventure type that you can pop in and watch every once in awhile for enjoyment.  There is also the fact once seen, the outcome is known and the surprises are gone.

One of the chief suspects in the murders was the former ""Porno King"" of 1970s ""XXX"" movies namely, John Curtis Holmes.  Back in 1981, John Holmes had been reduced to being a thieving, degenerate, manipulative cocaine user who had not actually made a movie in two years.

1970593,3,B00014K58W,"Highlights: Decent performances from the cast led by Val Kilmer; several brilliant, genuinely poignant scenes; sustained grim atmosphere that aids the plot.
Lowpoints: Sketchy, amateur editing; strained direction; plot provides no resolution.
Conclusion: From the director of the inspired-but-uneven road-flick ""Highway"" (with Jake ""Darko"" Gyllenhall tripping on acid ""Hunter S. Thompson style"")comes a gloomy overview of the notorious life of 1970s pornstar John Holmes. While the topic has been handled in a more general (and much better, at that) matter by P.Anderson in ""Boogie Nights"", ""Wonderland"" focuses on the specific day that the infamous murders were committed. The story is told good-ol' ""flashback-style"", letting us in on the main characters' versions of what actually happened.
 The film's topic is a little to grand for the director to handle, which becomes obvious in choppy editing that cuts away from some crucial moments, the uneven narrative, and the lack of conclusion - what DID happen? Unfortunately, ""Wonderland"" does not convince us that it doesn't matter who, it's about how - we enjoyed 'how' but we still want the 'who', and the film leaves it up to us to guess.
 Despite all that, nowadays movies have to be reviewed on the 'contrast' basis: in contrast to most of the other fluff nowadays, ""Wonderland"" manages to enthrall with quality acting (the ever reliable Val Kilmer carries his scenes, while Kate Bosworth as his girl and Lisa Kudrow as his wife impress with unexpected poignant performances), some gripping moments (don't expect much sex, but do expect much violence), and an honest approach. Worth a rent. If you're into that kinda thing, that is.",1079395200,,1688,5.294776119402985
1970594,2,B00014K58W,"Does anybody remember the Wonderland murders that happened in 1981?  I certainly don't.  Perhaps it's my ""East Coast bias"" showing through, but this film certainly didn't live up to my expectations in terms of either style or substance.  There are many things that caused my head to buzz with cognitive dissonance after viewing the DVD, but here are the top 4.
1. The director uses quick cuts between multiple camera angles and various distortion effects, usually to simulate a drug-induced freneticism...ad nauseum.  The device works a few times, but the director runs it into the ground, ruining the aesthetics of the film.
2. Most of the main characters are well-known actors who are (except for Kilmer) playing totally against type (e.g., Dylan McDermott is barely recognizable as a tattooed junkie, Carrie Fisher has a brief cameo as a ""holy roller,"" and Lisa Kudrow is totally humorless as John Holmes' estranged wife.  The only two characters who seem to be correctly cast are Kilmer and Kate Bosworth. Their passionate but dysfunctional relationship is one of the few things that huamizes this film and allows it to be remotely watchable.
3. The inclusion of the LAPD crime scene video on the DVD, showing the real crime scene and real corpses of the real victims of the Wonderland murders is unconscionable.  This footage is gruesome, bloody, and totally unnecessary. I couldn't watch the whole thing.  There is often a fine line between Hollywood and reality, and this crosses that line in an obvious and tasteless way.  Showing theatrical blood splattered on the wall of a set is one thing, but the real crime scene video is disturbing and completely inappropriate for inclusion on the disc.
4.  Although the way in which the storyline is divulged is clever, it failed to hold my interest and I actually fell asleep about an hour and ten minutes.  I woke up during the final five minutes of the film, and sadly, when I skimmed the portion I slept through the following day, I found that I hadn't missed much.
I usually enjoy history and crime dramas, but this one was so senseless and sordid that it does not merit the ultimate glorification it receives by the filmmakers.  If I could unrent it and unsee it, I would most definitely do so.  Fortunately, the film is thoroughly forgettable, so it should not be difficult to put it out of my mind.",1079308800,15,2356,4.818858560794045
1970595,5,B00014K58W,"I like this movie more than I thought I would. Some of the reviews have not been very positive but I actually think that the movie in general was well done.
Val Kilmer gives a staggering performance as porn legend John Holmes and he engulfed the charater of the drug addicted and doomed porn star completely which made it totally believeable.
The film does not discuss Holmes career as the biggest male porn star of the 70's or the adult movie industry for that matter, is all about the quadruple murder that shocked Los Angeles on July 1, 1981 where Holmes was a suspected to have been involve in. His name was eventually clear of all possibility linking him to the murders.
The cinematography is often dark and some of the scenes are somewhat difficult to really see and understand what is going on since about half of the movie was filmed at night. The rest of the cast does a good job especially Dylan McDermott who plays an informant(and heroin user) to the police about Eddie Nash a notorious drug dealer with possible ties to the mob but who strongly believes and confesses to the police that Holmes was the one that radded them out.
Lisa Kudrow who plays Holmes estranged and separated wife (they're not officially divorced) is pretty good considering her small role. Holmes mistress Dawn is also good as the the other woman involve in his rollercoaster life who sees her own life spiraling out of control.
The DVD also brings and added bonus: a second DVD that chronicles the life and times of John Holmes from his childhood to his ultimate stardom in the adult industry and eventually his untimely death of Aids in 1988 at the age of 43. WONDERLAND, the movie and the documentary which narrates Holmes life is a good way to spend an evening especially if you have nothing better to watch on television.

People comment on how bad or good Val Kilmer's portrayal of John Holmes is, but to be honest, I don't know enough about John Holmes and his offscreen personality in the real world to know how accurate Val's performance is.  He seemed to do fine to me.  He's certainly too good looking to be John Holmes though.  The film takes advantage of that whole quick-cut, MTV-like camera work which I find quite annoying.  I don't know quite how accurate this film is, but it does put Holmes in a few different scenarios where his role in the murders is different each time.  That's probably the most interesting thing about the film.  Each of these scenarios could have very well happened, you decide.  There is virtually no time devoted to his film career at all, just a few references.  This was a good play, coz we've already got Boogie Nights to basically tell us that story.
