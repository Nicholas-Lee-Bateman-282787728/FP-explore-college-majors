This series takes you to places that are not common - most series have the beach, waves, aquariums, waterfalls, etc., but to get to see swamps, everglades, and different parts of Africa?  To me, it feels like I can bring a piece of any part of the world into my home.

I hope the price of these drops, as I think $20 is too steep in this market, and I want more titles but can't afford them!  Other suggestions - I always prefer to have natural sounds options and musical options.  These just have relaxaing music.  Keep them coming!!!",1219104000,,690,4.516129032258065
