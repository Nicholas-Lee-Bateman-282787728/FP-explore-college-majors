8382402,5,B000M59VAS,"This DVD was originally produced by the Bible Society and won an award. Although is over 20 years old, the presentation of the information about the accuracy and sheer number of the ancient manuscripts of the Bible is superb. The first of the three programmes is ideal to watch at a first session of Alpha, Start, Christianity Explored, and one man told me that he was converted by watching the first programme! This is a very useful resource to use with a group of enquirers or to give to someone who doubts the historicity of the Christian faith or the reliability of the Bible.",1318982400,,580,4.586538461538462
8382403,4,B000M59VAS,"The Incomparable Book: Messages from the Memory Banks was very well researched. The questions that many of us have had about the authenticity of the bible and its origins are very well explained. The presenter makes it fun to watch and held my interest. It took a little time for me to get used to his British accent, but, after hearing it for a short while, he's entertaining.",1226275200,,377,4.5588235294117645
