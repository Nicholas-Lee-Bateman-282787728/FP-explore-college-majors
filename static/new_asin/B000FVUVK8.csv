8127415,5,B000FVUVK8,"First of all this is the original two-hour cut of the film and not the butchered and re-edited hour-and-half version that the distributors found fit for the American public and that was panned by the critics. I previously owned the DVD (Also with the original cut) and had enjoyed the movie several times.

This film is an Epic Fantasy in the ""Wuxha"" tradition but at the same time somewhat rather different -with more emphasis in the fantasy, almost like a folk-tale- and like in all good fairy-tales, lessons are eventually provided for all involved. Five  different characters find their destiny: an extremely loyal slave (Who starts crawling and ends up flying), an arrogant General (Who finally discovers love for the first time), a cunning beautiful Princess (Who is cursed to lose every man she loves), an evil Duke  (Who at the end proves to be as insecure as he is evil), and a pitiable  assassin (Who betrayed not his people but himself). All the afore mentioned under the hand of gifted Director Kaige Chen providing us with the most incredible ravishing visuals, amazing wire-work and pathos of operatic proportions (Klaus Badelt composed the extraordinarily lyrical musical score).

This is a somewhat story-wise complex film with several intertwined plots with lot of different ideas that at the end provide the core for some hard-earned lessons, like the morality-play that all fairy-tales usually are. Many people have criticized the CGI of this movie and they are not at fault: the CGI in this film is quite far-reaching, and yes some is gorgeous (Fortunately most of the time) and some is poor (The bull's run for example), but do not let this to hinder your enjoyment of this stunningly beautiful film. This film is not perfect, but when it is good, it is exceedingly good.

The Bluray -though is single-layered- looks sumptuous in my 50"" plasma, and the Mandarin 7.1 DTS-Master HD audio sounds spectacular. The delivery by Amazon (Through a secondary seller) was excellent.",1353283200,4,1993,4.9879518072289155
8127416,3,B000FVUVK8,"I'm writing this review even though I generally feel that reviews should come only after you've seen the movie.  In this case that is partially correct.

I own the original DVD and I must say that even though I'd call it an Asian fantasy film, the effects seen during the buffalo scene are extremely cheesy.  This comes as a surprise as the movie itself was not intended to be a low-budget movie.

The reason this is an issue, is that to see that scene in a Blu-ray medium would seem to exacerbate the problem.

Because of this fact, and the fact that the movie might seem strange to the un-initiated, you might be disappointed.

I'd seen the movie advertised on MonkeyPeaches.com and from that alone, I made my purchase.  Keep in mind this is where I first saw Hero, Red Cliff and some other Asian films that I came to like.

This is more a cautionary review rather than a traditional review.  I highly suggest you rent the DVD, or Blu-ray, if you can, before making a purchase.",1232841600,,979,4.455056179775281
8127417,5,B000FVUVK8,Don't be suckered into getting this version it's ad is a lie. The ad say it's 150 Min because it has extended scenes and that is not true. The other single disc version they advertise here is also not 120 Min it's 110 Min. The real extented version that I have is only 122 Min and it also marks on the cover that say The Uncut Version. great film but false advertisment on this 2-Disc.,1153612800,12,385,4.1466666666666665
8127418,2,B000FVUVK8,"This ambitious movie is masterminded by Chen Kaige, one of the most prominent Director from mainland China after Zhang Yimou.  I was very impressed by some of his earlier works and based upon his illustrious references, one would imagine this movie would be a sure winner especially when it was also nominated for this year Golden Globe Award Best Foreign Movie category.  Based upon the diverse mix of actors and actresses involved in this movie, one would presume that the production company wishes to broaden its appeal in the Asia market.  For example, Hiroyuki Sanada is the ""in-thing"" now in Japan (a charismatic presence in the Last Samurai), Jang Don-guang (very famous in Korea), Nicholas Tsie (famous actor and Canto-pop singer from Hong Kong) and Vivian Hsu (notorious for her bold showing in soft-porn movies in Asia, originated from Taiwan).  Anyway, the story is simple enough, a young girl (orphan?) is given a promise to be the most beautiful princess in the Land as long as she's willing to forsake to find the true love in her life.  The question is why does the ""Mother Fairy"" chooses to grant her the wish?  Explanation is never forthcoming but suffice to say that ""The Promise"" is all about special effects gone berzerk.  Whilst it's made in the spirit of Lord of the Rings trilogy, one could feel that every actions, every movements, every (sub)plots are there to highlight the marvel of special effects.  To make an effective movie, special effects need to be made secondary, and it's there to facilitate the telling of a story.  A story that's made without a soul, without human emotions is simply ain't going to work.  If you ask the Weinstein brothers from Miramax, they wouldn't be involved in this movie whatsoever because it's simply not within their parameters.  Anyway, to make better movies, one should experiment and I applaud Chen Kaige for doing that but in this instance, I think he has missed his mark.  There are simply too many moments that he pinched from other movies such as Superman, Mission Impossible, Lion King, Lord of the Rings, Silence of the Lamb and the list continues but all characters here are very wooden and two-dimensional but that I sat through the longest two hours of my life.  Anyway, the script is very incoherent especially when the Princess grows up into this woman but remember, she was an orphan beforehand and she literally had to steal food from dead people before.  Instead of depicting the Princess as a rare gem, she's portrayed more like a nymph with a slutty tendency because she has this 'just because she couldn't get love anyway and therefore, why serious about it?' mentality.  To cut the story short, whilst Chinese made movies are going through leaps and bounds right now, this probably would be the largest disappointment of the year.  What saddens me is that many of these actors here are A-grade and very accomplished and it's still beyond me why they would get themselves involved in such a contrived and messily-put together movie?  The additional feature is the making of the movie, which is compiled on a separate disc, 110 minutes long. Obviously, Chinese movie is upping its standard in terms of disc presentation as well.  Yes, the effort is made but still, it has a long way to go.",1152403200,7,3271,4.821109123434705
