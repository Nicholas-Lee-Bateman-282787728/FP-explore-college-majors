8498439,2,B006HH5ZDM,"I love Metallica so I feel ripped off that this is not an official metallica dvd. There is no metallica music at all, just some British people talking about metallica's roots. I'm pretty bummed that of the two disc's in this documentary one of them was cracked so I can't even watch it, and the other one which I was able to watch was a complete let down. Make sure if you are looking for an official metallica dvd to pass the his one up.",1487376000,,438,4.1647058823529415

8498442,1,B006HH5ZDM,"Not happy with this set, does not indicate that it is NOT authorized by Metallica...and is not solely regarding Metallica.  Bought it as a gift.  The quality is poor (like someone recorded interviews with random people from their living room from their phone).  Bought for my husband who is an avid Metallica fan.
