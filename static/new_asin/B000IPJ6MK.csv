8147227,5,B000IPJ6MK,"Don't you love that painted look in colorized versions? Yes and you will only get this in these editions of Disney's Zorro, continued here in 8 more episodes of volume 4 of season 1.

Lots of ""Eagle"" action as the storyline continues; lots of laughs and memories of the golden days of television. Grab now whilst still available and enjoy. My Sundays have returned to Disney at 6.30pm for a couple of hours and Zorro joins my other Disney favs. The old shows always the BEST - colorized or not!",1268438400,6,494,4.488888888888889
