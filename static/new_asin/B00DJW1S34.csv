5819672,4,B00DJW1S34,"I wanted to give this 5 stars but because the Tonight Show band music is missing throughout the program and some ""funky"" little combo tracks are played that really discounts the authenticity of the program. Along with that the Ed McMahon's full introduction has been clipped, probably because of the music situation again. Other than these things the program's contents are a welcomed journey down the wonderful memory lane of the Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson. It is great to have the complete monologues, the guest interviews, the commercials, and the guest singers and musicians performances. We are almost there...let's hope that future issues will include ""everything"" and the show will really be ""complete."" Until then I will enjoy what I have in hand right now.",1378684800,7,774,5.150793650793651
5819673,4,B00DJW1S34,"The ONLY thing keeping me from rating this 5 stars is the ludicrous price.... I paid it , but I'm not on a budget.  If I didn't own everything else Carson on DVD It would probably be the last thing I purchased due to its poor minute per dollar ratio.  It is certainly fun to enjoy close to complete episodes in comparison to the butchered mess on his other programs most notably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tonight-4-Decades-of-The-Tonight-Show-starring-Johnny-Carson/dp/B003V0FW9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tonight - 4 Decades of The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson</a>&nbsp;Being a fan of Dom Deluise doesn't hurt my rating either, he was a genius comedian and a brilliant guest.

5819674,5,B00DJW1S34,"This was a good selection of episodes. The 10th anniversary show was an amazing collection of talent on stage together and interacting spontaneously. Let's have more episodes with more Don Rickles - in his prime he was the funniest man alive. And include some with Buddy Hackett! I haven't seen him since the 70s but remember he was a very funny guy. Do the show where Buddy told the story of borrowing a sweet old lady's camera while she was away, taking a certain picture, and replacing her camera! Lot's of hilarious memories from that era. I'm glad they're doing this series and with such good quality. They ought to do the show that aired on Jan. 1, 1971, which contained the final cigarette commercial ever to air on U.S. TV: Virginia Slims .... and include that full 60 second commercial.",1377129600,2,795,4.6453900709219855

5819678,5,B00DJW1S34,"While the box sets have been great, I think that what every ""Tonight Show"" fan has been hoping for is full-length shows. Not ones where the entire guest list is announced, then only certain segments are included, and not somebody else's idea of ""best of"".

This first volume includes two shows from late 1972 (the second show date comes first and the first date is second; a tad odd, but okay), plus a bonus clip from around the same time. One feature I wasn't expecting is that the menu allows you to select viewing each show with *or* without the commercials; if the commercials bugged you the first time they aired years ago, you can dispense with them now. Personally, I like seeing which ads I remember and what isn't being manufactured anymore. Nice walk down advertising's Memory Lane.

The editing of the band's original music has been a topic of some discussion; while I wish it had all been left completely intact, the substitution isn't uncomfortable or disruptive. (As long as it wasn't played by a kazoo band or electronic keyboard, I'm fine with it. Just kidding.). Given the reviews that I'd read, I thought it was going to be awful. As it turned out, it was better than I expected. Much better, in fact.

All in all, I'm really glad I got this. We're enjoying it thoroughly and look forward to Volume 2.",1374537600,19,1319,4.604255319148936
5819679,4,B00DJW1S34,"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson - The Vault Series: Volume 1 is a step in the right direction for Carson fans.  The shows are complete and include some original commercials which is really interesting to see.  However, there is some editing of music in the opening theme and commercial breaks. It's not perfect but it's the best release we've gotten thus far.  I look forward to Volume 2.",1372896000,4,396,4.7101449275362315
5819680,1,B00DJW1S34,"The Johnny Carson Vault series which professes to be complete is not complete. All of the original music(including the opening theme song!!)has been scrubbed and replaced with anemic smaller band recordings designed to fool the buyer. I would imagine that the company that is putting out this video doesn't want to pay the musicians in Doc Severinsen's orchestra so they just pulled the plug on the original music and dubbed in some cheap recordings that mimic the sound of the original. Johnny Carson loved the fact that he had one of the greatest orchestras of all time on his show every night. I guarantee you that Johnny himself would never consider these shows ""complete"".

8593880,5,B00DJW1S34,"I have seen reports from others that say they got copies missing the original opening theme song and Ed McMahon stating ""From Hollywood..The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson.."" and then he recites this evenings guests.  Well my copy that I just purchased at Costco HAS all if this intact.

So I wonder if after all of the complaints, Carson Entertainment re-mastered the Volume 1 DVDs?

Both of these are great shows, but are out of order.  The proper sequence would be to watch the second show on the disc, then the first show (the 10th Anniversary show).  The second show on the disc makes references to the upcoming 10th Anniversary show.

I just love to watch these with the original National Commercials.  Note that when we watched these, th elocal station would insert their commercials in after the 60 seconds of national commercials.  Since the local commercials are not here and the stand-by bumper has been shortened, these 90 minute shows run only 76:30 BUT they ARE COMPLETE.

One thing I am not sure of is the music over the end credits, it is not the music that I remember.  But this is over 40 years ago and I may not remember a different theme over the credits.  Applause from an audience can be heard over most of the end theme, but that could have been mixed in.  But I can assure you that the original theme is in the opening with Ed announcing.

I am surprised to see the NBC Peacock color opening, I thought NBC had dropped this by 1972.",1403740800,3,1461,4.530534351145038
8593881,5,B00DJW1S34,"UPDATE!!

I just purchase the complete set from the Johnny Carson Vault Series (Volumes 1 through 6) and I can honestly tell you now that all of the original music and the guests lineup being announced by Ed are ALL there now. I have no idea when the change was made, but if you are worried about the music being cut out, you no longer have to worry about that.

One other note - The entire quality of Volume 1 is just plain mind-blowing excellent. I'd almost swear that I was watching this in High Definition because it was that good.  And the tenth anniversary show itself is outstanding. However, you won't see Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis together. Dean makes a few comments at the beginning of the DVD and Jerry is one of the guest stars.

I gave this one a solid FIVE (5) stars.  Take my word, Volume 1 is absolutely awesome, especially if you want to experience being in a time capsule and taken back in time to watch Johnny Carson in his prime.",1401408000,3,951,4.320224719101123

8593885,4,B00DJW1S34,"I enjoyed the episodes AND, yes, the commercials! (Although I hesitate to believe that those were the actual network commercials that aired during those specific programs.) It's nice to finally have some (almost) complete episodes instead of the butchered episodes presented in the previously released big box sets.

I am, however, disappointed that the theme and bump music on one of the two episodes was re-recorded. Why? It defeats the purpose of having original ""uncut"" episodes of one of the greatest programs in TV history. The shows are great... but NO need to re-record the bump music or the iconic theme song and Ed McMahon intro.",1385769600,2,639,5.028301886792453
