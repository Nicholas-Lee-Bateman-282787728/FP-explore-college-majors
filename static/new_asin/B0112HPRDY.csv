Forgive me but perhaps because I was a history buff of sort, and attended the  U of I in honors history I have a differnt view.. It would take to long to list all of the missing milestones but the Space program was chopped more than others... But the video series was a nice simplistic overview of major history events.

8723361,5,B0112HPRDY,"This American Genius DVD has 8 amazing docudramas about the back stories of early American inventors and innovators, revealing how competition held back some and pushed forward others.  I was so thrilled by the reenactments and expert interviews in each of the 8 segments that I search for interesting books that also explored the rivalries, power struggles, deceit, timing and pure ambition involved in bringing to past these great inventions and innovations.  I even found a few picture books to read to young students about Farnsworth, the real inventor of television, Tesla, the genius who harnessed DC current, and Curtiss who succeeded in using his more powerful engines for military airplanes.  I highly recommend watching all 8 episodes of the American Genius!",1451088000,2,768,5.278688524590164
