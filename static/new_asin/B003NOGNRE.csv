8401309,1,B003NOGNRE,"They sure took a long time to depict adultery, spousal disrespect, whats-best-for-us-not-the-child self-absorbed choices, self-introspection AD NAUSEUM, the perpetual advancement of the homosexual agenda via a crude gay sex description scene delivered in scene aftet scene of angst ridden forty something's on Xanex trying to be witty. I am a HUGE fan of movies, as they shape our culture and are at once, a reflection of it. Watch this and you won't wonder what's happened to America. This movie is a right on-target view of the Me Culture we live in with barely a smidge of ""how will my choices affect you?"" Have you ever sat and listened to someone who knows little or nothing about much, attempt to pontificate deep meanings out of absolutely nothing? Or listened interminably to a story awaiting a climactic end only to hear ""...and she stepped on the ball!"" While perhaps it would propel society foward to ponder the extraordinary depth of how having an inny or an outy belly button correlates with one's personality, I for one don't care, except that that discussion is on par with this film. No deep meanings here. Just 2 people who made promises to each other when it felt good then threw them aside when it wasn't fun any more. If that isn't typical Hollywood I don't know what is. Another cogent example might be  good example would be renewing wedding vows after being married 4 months.  Really?? We dozed off often over the utter predictability of it and the lack of any substantive reparte. Since we thought at least Hutton would deliver, we bought it. We always try to honor the effort in this medium, so watched to the end as a sign of respect for that. Alas, there were no hidden depths. When the CHILD has more depth and conscience than the adults what's wrong with that picture??  So we walked it to the trash can and plunked it in, thinking no more about it than that. It says a lot when we don't even recycle the case.",1508630400,,1939,4.647230320699708

8401315,5,B003NOGNRE,"I can't remember where I saw a reference to this film but I owe whomever tweeted about it, mentioned it on FB, or what have you a debt of gratitude. It spoke to me completely in the sense that all three main characters resonated with my own experiences. I guess the reviewer who hated it so profoundly hasn't experienced the combination of bad timing, ambivalence, and cold feet that seems to dictate the course of so many relationships, nor pondered whether the consequences of our actions or inactions in this context are somehow fated by our deep character flaws or rather within our control. For me a huge portion of the film rang very true, and the parts that didn't still worked as hyperbole to add emphasis and humor. I also thoroughly appreciated the original and refreshing art direction and the soundtrack. And while not a feel-good film, the bittersweet treatment of the characters is handled without meanness or cynicism. To all involved, from the writer/director to the cast and production team, I can only say ""well done indeed!""",1333670400,3,1043,4.832402234636872
8401316,1,B003NOGNRE,"A pretentious piece of trash, the dialogue seems to be taken with trying to convince us how these characters are sophisticated New York intellectuals as they make references to behaving like white trash (heaven forbid) yet their favorite expletive is the f-bomb. Then they go on a vagina tirade and it seems they play a game of how many times they can get the word into a 2 minute scene like naughty little school boys who just learned what the word means. Who uses the word vagina anyway other than medical people? Taking the Lord's name in vain seems like an after thought as though the director realized they hadn't offended enough people so he crammed it in several times nearer the end.  It seems to me if being ""white trash"" was so abhorrent to them perhaps cleaning up their mouths might be a good place to start improving.

The title even strikes me as pretentious drivel. Timothy Hutton seems to be stuck in the typewriter, scruffy beard, bathrobe, professor look these days. I think we're supposed to care about these characters but I didn't like any of them (even the precocious kid). Oh, and let's not forget the token relationship enlightened Gabriel has with his gay friend. If I were gay I'd be offended at this attempt to appeal to me. People used to make fun of white people who told black people that they had a black friend. This movie is telling us Gabriel is so with it he has a real gay friend!..... The movie is so ridiculous it's embarrassing.

I doubt the movie will receive the reviews the fake playwright did in this pseudo-intellectual dud. My advice to the producer ""bury it at sea some cold dark night"" and then hope we all forget.",1313625600,5,1661,4.567114093959732
8401317,5,B003NOGNRE,How can you not love Timothy Hutton! Great job by all the cast members and especially loved the scenes with actress Paris Rose Yates as Elizabeth's best friend!,1299024000,6,160,4.75
