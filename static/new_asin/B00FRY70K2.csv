6030753,2,B00FRY70K2,"Yes, other reviewers noted that if you just want to watch ""goofy horror"" then this might be your kind of movie.  But I'm scratching my head now, trying to compare this one to a number of other low-budget ""disaster"" movies, to figure if any of them were any better.

The plot is fairly lame..ok SPOILER ALERT!  SPOILER ALERT!  Yes it's supposed to relate to an ancient Indian (Mayan?  what tribe?  I forget, if it said) prophecy about the END OF THE WORLD.  Funny how the only signs of the approaching END OF THE WORLD seem to be appearing in the town of Calgary... Calgary, somewhere.  In fact the whole town gets sealed off from the rest of the world by some kind of force field as the 12 signs of the end unfold.

Oh, just as signs of disaster begin, our heroine's grandmother gives her an ""ancient"" ring and tells her that she is the secret to saving humanity.  Then grandma dies before getting to explain any more.  So, confused heroine and dad have to seek out...OF COURSE...an old bookseller in this small town who JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE in his possession an ancient book about this prophecy, which he's been studying for years.  How fortunate that the girl with the special power, the ring, the book, all are in the right place at the right time--right?

Coolest parts (in my opinion) of the whole cheesy movie are the idea that the prophecy about the disastrous warning signs was cleverly hidden in the ""12 Days of Christmas"" song, so that it would be remembered centuries later!  (Good thing the song was a hit and not forgotten, eh what?)  Also the ""ancient book"" with its hand-drawings of the disasters and how to stop them.  I confess I'm a sucker for old books and maps and artwork.  Someone must have spent hours drawing these color sketches.  Too bad the viewers can't spend more time appreciating the art because...well that art surpasses the CG effects, surpasses the dialog, surpasses the ""acting"", and just about anything else in the film.  A reviewer on Wikipedia noted ""some bad films are just bad while others you end up watching in perverse fascination ""in the hope they will never get better"".  If you enjoy films that never do get better, you'll enjoy this one.  Personally what I like best is finding unexpectedly maybe ONE SCENE, perhaps only a few seconds of dialog or of visuals that somehow reach way above the rest of a low-budget production.  You'll find little of that here (if anything, as I say, probably the drawings in the old book).  Comparing to other ""low-grade disaster"" movies--the one which sticks out most in my mind is ""The Core"", a movie with, if anything even worse plot, acting and dialog than this one--yet something really stood out.  I was watching it just for something to do.  Some weird things start happening.  Birds flying the wrong direction for example.  Then, a space shuttle trying to land gets off-course and almost crashes killing everyone on board.  As I was watching the film, the shuttle Columbia's break-up on re-entry had JUST HAPPENED ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE!  In other words, this movie (made in 2008) depicted a shuttle problem upon re-entry that actually happened, shortly after the film was completed.  Well, it's also true that ""The Core"" had a much bigger budget and bigger-name actors than 12 Disasters (yet was almost equally bad, except the one memorable scene).

Oh yes, every movie like this has to have a bad guy, right?  In this case the bad guy (who wants to build a big box store which will put local businesses out of business--so, the perfect ""bad guy"" I guess?) thinks that the meaning of the book is that your young heroine has to be sacrificed in order to stop the end of the world...  Well, forewarned is....whatever.",1393804800,15,3700,4.660493827160494

6030757,4,B00FRY70K2,"Totally goofy- fun movie to watch with friends.  Pretty good effects- Grant it the movie is way off base- extreme over acting.  If time and subject matter was important character building would be of great benefit to understand why some went into rages so quickly, but more important - and frustrated me a bunch was the actors who started saying something like ""I need to tell you something ......then seemed confused like they didn't know how....One funny part to me was the end [spoiler alert] a flash of energy like fire consumed this girl and seems to have burnt her cloths off, but somehow her pretty long blond hair was okay!

6030758,4,B00FRY70K2,"Oh, Syfy Channel...you just continue to bring us the best in low-budget horror entertainment!  I say this with only the slightest hint of sarcasm; after all, I love the schlocky gems they have given us over the years, like SHARKNADO and ICE SPIDERS.  I have a new addition to my favorites list:  12 DISASTERS.  This film is an offering from director Steven R. Monroe, the genius behind 2010s I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE remake.  And while it won't be for everyone, 12 DISASTERS is a lot of fun if youll give it a chance.

You obviously cant go into this film expecting seriousness.  If you do, then youll hate it.  But if you take it for what it is, I bet you will enjoy it.  Theres too much here NOT to enjoy.

12 DISASTERS is shot well and looks good overall.  I do have to confess that the CG is not the best, but you shouldnt expect high-budget effects from a TV movie.  Still, the effects are not that bad, and they are even good enough to make you cringe every now and then.  Of particular note is when the giant icicles impale people; nice, gruesome imagery to take you through the rest of the movie!

Underneath the darkly comedic overtones (regardless of whether they are intentional or not), Monroe once again presents a strong female protagonist who is portrayed this time by Magda Apanowicz.  This plucky young actress does a great job with her role and is a joy to watch onscreen.  The rest of the cast does a pretty good job supporting her, however she is the primary focal point in the film.

12 DISASTERS is a win for me, although moviegoers expecting big-budget affairs should steer clear.  But if you can look past the exterior and enjoy the story within, this film should entertain plenty.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1389139200,30,1753,4.455974842767295

6030801,3,B00FRY70K2,"I bought this movie as an alternate holiday flick to offset some of the more syrupy offerings at this time of year.  The plot is appropriately whack-a-doodle, some nonsense about a set of rings and an obscure Mayan prophecy of impending doom.  Naturally, it takes place in Canada, where the secret magic rings are scattered about in supposedly hard to find locations (only a special decoder can decipher their resting places).  Yet they barely have to scratch below the surface to `dig' them up.  This movie starts with a very liberal rant against the evils of HUGE stores pushing out small businesses.  The villain of the piece just happens to be the evil owner of said store (Kane, played Roark Critchlow).  He goes from a concerned citizen to a deranged religious fanatic in about two seconds.  He wants to sacrifice the dopey daughter (Magda Apanowicz) of the town's leading liberal (played with a stupefying lack of emotion by Ed Quinn).  Will they find all five rings in time, can the dad with little personality save his daughter from the evil clutches of Kane, or is this the end of the world!!!!???

It's hard to imagine a movie with a plot dopier than this one that still manages to be highly entertaining.  I'm glad I bought it.  It's poorly made on every level (wasting the considerable talents of Donnelly Rhodes in a tiny role of a nervous Nelly fond of far too many conspiracy theories).  But it's fun.  Nothing says Merry Christmas like the end of the world!",1418256000,,1474,4.688715953307393
