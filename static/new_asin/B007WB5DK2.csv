Best part for me was the bonus material which provided Albert's progression over the years. I'm sorry to say I would not recommend especially at the price.

5112326,5,B007WB5DK2,"I have little to add to the glowing reviews here. The Audio and Video are superlative, and compliment the artistry of Albert Lee perfectly. The feature I really found helpful, is the ability to change the audio tracks on the fly without interrupting the song. Simply hit the menu button while the song is playing, and a small menu appears in the lower right hand corner of the screen. Choose audio setup, and the audio choices are displayed while the song continues to play. Make your choice, and the disc switches to that mode without interrupting the song. This is a great feature when you are trying to compare how the different audio tracks sound in your particular media room.",1354924800,7,681,4.683333333333334
5112327,5,B007WB5DK2,"If you like great playing. If you like great sound and picture. If you like Albert Lee. Buy this blu ray!
  This is a wonderful performance by Albert and his band that is recorded in high definition video and 96/24 high definition pcm audio.",1344211200,5,241,4.454545454545454
5112328,5,B007WB5DK2,"About 10 years ago I reviewed a DVD from Producer Mark Waldrep's AIX record label, featuring string-wizard John McEuen. It featured HD sound and HD video, as well as a feature that let you choose the camera angle. (All this was before the advent of Bluray.)

This new BD from AIX  - though a 2012 release - was recorded in 2006 at the Colburn School for Performing Arts in Los Angeles (Lee lives in Malibu when not on the road).

Lee is what I call the Zelig of the Americana music world. Though born and raised in the UK (he's a contemporary of  Beatles, Stones,  Yardbirds (he replaced Jimmy Page in a band when Page joined the Yardbirds), his heart was always in skiffle music in the UK and Country in the US. He came to the US as part of the band Head Hands and Feet who had a top US hit with ""Country Boy"" and 1971 and decided to stay. From there he began playing guitar and touring with Eric Clapton (5 years) and the Everly Brothers (20 years). He was also part of Emmy Lou Harris's band. While he had a couple of solo albums, he was more at ease as part of a backup group. But this guy can play and loves guitars.

I had the chance to see Lee in Memphis a few Years ago at the International Folk Alliance and his set blew me away. When I got this DVD I felt the same way. He leads his touring band and does the vocals for 58 minutes covering 14 songs by John Hiatt, Rodney Crowell, Johnny Burnette, Fats Domino, and TWO by Felice and Boudreau Bryant (who penned most of the Everly Brothers hits). The band also play the Lee co-write ""Country Boy"". The sound and the camera work is great and, even thought it's in HD, the image looked great on my 30 year old standard def television.

The DVD comes with some nice bonues. First there is a 35-minute interview (well, you don't hear the questions; just Lee's answers)  with the very personable Lee about his career. The producer cleverly inserts archival  still photos - and even video clips! - at appropriuate points in the interview. There are two other ""interview"" sections - recorded at the same time. In the first (7 minutes) Lee discusses how he learned to play the guitar and demonstrates it with his favorite model. In the last clip (4 minutes) he discusses his favorite guitars over the years.

There are text bios of the band members an a screen of liner notes.

The package incluses a 12 page booklet with the lyrics to all the songs performed.

Lee is often confused in name with another guitarist, Alvin Lee, from the band Ten Years after, but, while both play guitar, they are far different players. For my money, Albert wins hands down.

I know that producer Waldep added lots of tekkie bells and whistles to this DVD but most are beyond my sonic grasp. I do know that I loved watching this and found the performance (as well as the lengthy interview) highly entertaining.
I  hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5112329,5,B007WB5DK2,"Albert Lee is essentially a guitar legend. This Blu-ray is no shortcoming when talking about Albert Lee either.  As usual AIX Records have succeeded in capturing HD audio as well as HD video and bringing the intimacy of this session into your own living room.  Albert Lee has never sounded better.  With multiple mixes to choose from, you can listen to this great session how ever you like.  The interview with Albert Lee is just the icing on the cake with this product.  Recommended for music fans and guitar playing fans of all types.",1341878400,6,536,4.659574468085107
5112330,5,B007WB5DK2,"Stunning audio quality with several available tracks. Albert and band are smoking hot. If you like rockabilly and country guitar, you'll want this disc.

Don't miss the hour or so of bonus content where Albert talks about his amazing career, his guitars and how he learned to play. Also includes several sets of stereo audio files you can copy off the disc, MP3 and high-res FLAC of every tune.",1341446400,7,394,4.7101449275362315
5112331,5,B007WB5DK2,"I experienced a preview of this Blu-ray disc at a recent audiophile show and all I can say is wow! Albert sings and plays his favorite country tunes including his signature tunes ""Country Boy"" and ""Luxury Liner"" with a great  backup band. The whole thing is presented in HD...including the two 5.1 surround music mixes. In a good home theater this is as close to having a private concert as it gets. Highly recommended.",1339286400,7,419,4.662162162162162

8522466,5,B007WB5DK2,"Those in the know realize that Albert Lee is an utter guitar Monster, and has been for decades.  He takes runs, riffs, trills, and unknown descriptive verbs to his total guitar mastery for you to see and hear in this Blu-ray presentation.  Dang this guy is good.  What will blow your mind are the surround mixes of this performance.  Sit in the middle of your system and turn it up.  The depth of this sound envelope is expansive.  Go ahead, play your favorite CD, Blu-ray, SACD, or DVD-Audio right after listening to Albert Lee and his band, then go back to the ""Stage"" surround mix perspective in Dolby TrueHD.  State of the freaking art man.  I considered breaking my hands so that I would never do injustice to another guitar after listening to Albert, but then decided to simply sit with my mouth agape.",1429142400,,808,4.5625

8522469,3,B007WB5DK2,"I love this artist, and this company ,AIX, makes quality products. The bonus interview is nice but the show itself isn't as long as I'd hoped for but my biggest gripe is that they have a peddle steel guitarist sharing licks and sonic space with Albert and I blame the producer for that. I bought this hoping to hear Alberts' insane guitar playing, not his sidemen. For me this comes off more like a producer in love with getting all the other instruments in the action rather than a producer who realizes that Albert and his guitar should be the big issue and the other instruments and players are support. It IS Alberts' face on the cover and this isn't a cheap product by any means. I'd expect a longer show and more Albert to give this more than an average review...sadly.",1383004800,4,775,4.464788732394366
8522470,5,B007WB5DK2,"Seeing this in blu ray is a real treat.  I have been an Albert Lee fan for a while now and think he is a  phenomenal player.  The music is first rate.  It's filmed in a studio so that takes something away from it, but to watch and listen to him play makes  up for the surroundings.  I really thought it was great.",1375228800,2,313,3.888888888888889
8522471,4,B007WB5DK2,This is more of a studio type thing than a live performance with an audience like I had expected. Love Albert Lee and he is one of my guitar heroes. Was happy to get this and enjoyed watching.,1373241600,,192,4.078947368421052
8522472,4,B007WB5DK2,"The good...just purchased a flagship model Panasonic VT50 plasma,  and a Denon Home Theater Receiver.  This was the first Blu Ray that I watched and it did not disappoint,  The sound is superb,.,.if you can set your Blu Ray player and HT Receiver to support  DTS-HD Master 96kHz/24 bit audio,  the channel separation and crystal-clear sound will blow you away.

The bad (more like the ugly)  while they all are definitely great musicians they could have cleaned up themselves a little...they sort of look like the over-the-hill gang and have that Willie Nelson vibe goin' on.  Like they were dragged out of a bar for this gig.

I just watched the Fender 50 Year  Strat-pack Anniversary show where Albert does his signature song ""Country Boy"".  I don't know if he rose to the occasion more because of the live audience,  but that performance is by far better then what's on this disk.  However,  it is always amazing and entertaining to watch him.  The pedal steal guy is pretty amazing too.",1364169600,,990,4.741176470588235
