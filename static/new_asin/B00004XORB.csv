gone is the cute, sexy and cuddly charlie we knew and loved.
this is our charlie stretching her thespian muscles in a trying to be a serious portrait of a couple on the skids grade z type movie.
emphasis on grade Z!
looks like it was filmed with a cam-corder.
the lead male actor has about as much charm as the cowboy in the life of david gale. oh, but he has a gambling problem...i see.
y a w n .
i worry about the audience that would like this 'movie'.
charlie is no longer the charlie we savored and charlie fans, be forewarned.
the entire 'movie' is cheap, tawdry, unlikeable and a shame.
i returned it to the video store to be buried once again in the deep, dark stack from whence i pulled it.
Am now leary of latter-day spradling projects. will stick with her early 90's period for sure.",1047772800,,1018,4.307291666666667
7926045,5,B00004XORB,"Max has a little problem.  Bridgette has a little problem. Even the roommate has a little problem. And the biggest problem of all, is that they  have succeeded in hiding their problems . . . from themselves.
Max (Jason  London) is a frustrated out of work actor. He likes football -- when he  bets on the right team with the right point spread, that is. But when he  loses on his expectant guesses (rather than educated guesses), he refuses  to cut his losses and deal. Instead, he doubles up on his bets, trying to  make headway back into the non-negative digits. As you might guess,  sometimes he wins and sometimes he loses. And sometimes he loses more than  he can ever win back.
Bridgette (Charlie Spradling) has her own smaller  problem. (Or so she'd have you think.) When compared to her long-term  boyfriend's gambling problem, is a little social drinking really a problem?  Well, if she does it all day, and alone, yup it pretty much is!
Then  there is the dream roommate we've all searched for, but instead ended up  with the ""Single White Female"" variety. This roommate is quiet,  kind, considerate, always ready to do Max's laundry, spot him cash, cook  the dinners -- you name it! Max's friends constantly tease him about his  Mr. Mom roommate, but they all secretly like him, and Max is thankful for a  friend like him. But, as together as he might seem, he too has a little  problem. He's in love with Max. The realization would be a shocker to Max.  But, it's obvious that admitting his true feelings to himself is the real  test.
This film delves into how these three separate lives run together  and how they coexist in each others vices and problems. It's rather honest  in the illustration of how we act and feel when we are young and trying to  figure ourselves out. We seem to think we will have our whole lives ahead  of us to get ourselves on the right track, but what about all the years  we've wasted?  Invincible is the word that comes to mind, when describing  these characters. Invincible, yet scared and in denial. Those three things  are opposite in nature, and so you see the conflicts fueling these three  into understanding themselves and those around them.
This film has as  much humor and great one-liners as it does heart and soul. It's a  combination that any actor would be happy to be a part of, because its  eclectic emotions let them show their many facets. Jason's comedic side was  illustrated quite successfully, as well as his dramatic ability.  In fact,  there is one incredible scene in this film that I'm sure will come to mind  everytime I think of Jason in a dramatic role. I've always considered Jason  slow on reaching that emotional meltdown within his characters. But on this  film, he was so in touch with the sensitivity and emotion within himself,  that he almost had me crying in one scene! (I just wasn't about to start  bawling in a public place.:)
As a writer, I have to send kudos out for  the great writing. For without good words for the actors to relay, there  would be no movie and definitely no heart to the characters. Actors can  make characters come to life in the most incredible ways, but the writer  gave life to the characters long before, hoping to find the right host to  do the written character justice. In this film, they won on both accounts  -- writing and acting.",967075200,2,3346,4.564924114671164
