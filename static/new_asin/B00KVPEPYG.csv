6451602,5,B00KVPEPYG,"Hunter future cop is an interesting movie. Lt. Hunter played by Ron Becks is dealing with a cop killer, his boss blackmailing him, and having to care for a runaway from Tennessee. There are 2 interactions in the movie that I liked. One is between the Tennessee runaway named Kelly played by the talented Magda Marcella and Hunter's boss Captain Goodwell played by Kristine Debell from Meatballs fame. The other are the chats between Kelly and Lt Hunter who it seems like to play the trombone. The movie also stars ex 007 George Lazenby as a American general. Not sure what his whole role is since his character just seems to vanish from the movie. I look forward to seeing more stuff from Ron Becks and Magda Marcella.",1443052800,,718,4.6171875
