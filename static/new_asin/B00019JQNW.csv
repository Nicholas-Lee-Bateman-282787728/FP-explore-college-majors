8008670,5,B00019JQNW,"This dvd was by far the funniest dvds I have ever seen. In this dvd Iggy(the loser geek and the wanna b Tak) gets a car. At first he presents it as a 86', but when his boss takes a look at it under the hood its actually a 85'(which is funny because of the difference in power). So after the guys laugh at iggy then he decides to accept that car as his own and decides to take it for a run up the akina trail. As soon as they reach the top they are then confronted by a gang of street racers who are looking for the person who drives the 86'. Tak and Iggy exit the 85' and the guys decide to make fun of them because of their ages and the fact that they have an old car. Little do they know that Tak is the best driver and they are about to get a little surprise. As soon as the gang leaves Tak decides to take on those drivers on a little downhill competition. He takes the 85' AND WHOOPS THEM!! So if you like to see that happen then you have got to buy this dvd. Cuz only one word describes this dvd. HYSTERICAL",1111104000,2,1013,3.8285714285714287

Meanwhile, Takumi and Natsuki openly express their feelings for each other and finally start dating. Little does Takumi realize that Natsuki is dating someone else.",1095897600,,325,5.269230769230769
8008672,4,B00019JQNW,"This one was better than the 3rd but not the second. A little more character devlopment plus we get to see Iggy's serious side. He gets a sucky 85 and gets picked on but begins to like the car cause its his.
Tak finally races a dirty drive from the Night Kids with a Honda Civic hatchback. I got sick of him racing good goodies so it ld be interesting on part 5",1078790400,2,361,3.958904109589041
8008673,5,B00019JQNW,I'm not much of a racing fan and I don't know much about cars. But this DVD really changed my thinking about cars. I actually like to drive now (LOL). So far this is the best anime I seen so far. This DVD has the best graphics on the cars.,1074556800,,239,3.8
