7972586,3,B00006LPC7,"This was set up as an interesting piece and to a point it was. Wenders takes a typical approach for him and, with his somewhat enigmatic subject (Yamamoto), presents something engaging. The problems come with the sound and picture quality...the latter the worst but both disappointing. The dvd needs a lot of work to 'deserve' both the subject and the work of the film-maker.",1400803200,,375,4.875
7972587,1,B00006LPC7,"I love Yohji's clothing and I thought this movie would give me more insight on his creative process. It fell a little short for me on many levels. Maybe I'm not familiar with the filmmaker or the style of which he shoots his films. But I found his cinematography to be distracting and his directing to be less about Yohji and more about himself. Which may be what's cool about it, but wasn't what I was expecting. I assumed it was going to be a documentary about a fashion designer, not a narrative monologue thats badly shot movie with an equally horrible soundtrack. For such a modern fashion designer, this was a horrible representation.",1224028800,7,640,4.62280701754386
7972588,5,B00006LPC7,"I bought my own copy of this movie after renting it. Like Latcho Drom, it's something that I've watched more times than I can count; each time, I come away with something new. Here, the meditations on who we think we are, and the shaping power of place in forming our identities (a power that's really thrown into question in our ever-more-placeless times), encourage me to think again about my own identity, and what shapes it.
There are other pleasures here as well, springing forth from the collaboration of two deeply thoughtful people, Wenders and Yamamoto. Among them--thoughts about how clothes ""make the man"" (or person); the paradoxical idea of fashion as an art form; how many people's work goes into making one person famous as an ""artist""; whether Eastern or Japanese ideas of artistic identity differ from Western ones; and much more--you're sure to find your own themes. Some of the music is a bit overblown, but that's my only, slight reservation. The pace might seem slow, but if you slow down with it and let it speak to you (and think WITH you), you're sure to come away with a richer perspective on much in life.
PS--the DVD version has a good commentary overlay by Wenders.",1073260800,15,1193,4.740384615384615
