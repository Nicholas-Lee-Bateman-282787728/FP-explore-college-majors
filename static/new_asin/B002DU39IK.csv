3912645,4,B002DU39IK,"The movie is a little corny but if you liked Northern Lights. part of the the Nora Roberts collection, you will enjoy this. Brittany Murphy is great. I am so glad that I ordered the movie since Brittany Murphy passed away today. I beleive she was 32. There is a editing error in the movie, one big and one small. See if you can find them. The more times you see the movie, the better it gets.",1265068800,16,392,4.103896103896104
3912646,1,B002DU39IK,"I agree with other reviewer comments.  This movie only minutely follows Nora Robert's book of the same title.  The acting was horrible.  Brittany Murphy was clearly a poor choice for the lead female role.  Her attempts to play a romantic heroine was laughable.  Plus, the hairdo she had throughout the film is enough to turn one off.  Was the budget so tight that even a comb would have put the movie over budget?  The guy wasn't much better but at least he didn't consistently overact his role as much as Murphy did.  The movie was also so disjointed that it didn't make a whole lot of sense in numerous places.  Suffice it to say that it was an effort to watch it all the way through.  It was ironic that I had just finished reading the book the same day this movie was shown.  Was totally amazed how the makers of the movie could have put out such a piece of worthless and uninteresting film and used Nora Roberts name as a draw to get it shown during prime time TV.  Wonder if Ms. Roberts has seen this travesty of her book?  This one is a candidate for a ""Razzberry"" award.  Don't waste your time or money on this one. It stinks.",1261872000,3,1134,4.287735849056604
3912647,1,B002DU39IK,Great Seller...The movie was terrible.  Bad acting by all.  Nothing more I can say about it except...Save your money.,1258329600,3,117,5.105263157894737
3912648,1,B002DU39IK,"This movie was beyond horrible.  I can't say enough bad things about it.  If you've read the book first you will know what I'm talking about.  Why they would ever cast Britany Murphy as Cilla McGowen is beyond me.  She is nothing like the character in the book.  Cilla is tall, blond and with ice blue eyes.  Murphy is short with brown eys.  And that actor who played Ford Sawyer was a complete disaster.  The acting was atrocious.  Who ever wrote the script and directed this should be ashamed for tearing apart a totally wonderful book until it became absolutely unrecognizable on film.  I would give it less than one star if I could.  Skip this movie and buy the book.  You won't feel you've wasted your time.",1256428800,5,712,4.4765625
3912649,1,B002DU39IK,"Tribute mixes the corny acting of a soap opera with the silly scares of a B-horror movie. The movie descends into a drama about a 30-year-old suicide/murder. Despite the description of the movie, the whole ""child actor"" drama doesn't really play as large a role.

The acting is pretty lame. Jason Lewis doesn't come across as a comforting boyfriend, but rather as a stalker in his own right. Maybe it's his sinister voice, or the fact that he looks at Brittany Murphy with binoculars. Nonetheless, he doesn't work well. Brittany Murphy isn't horrible, but not compelling - almost as if she were the child actor who quit acting.

The movie leaves loose ends everywhere. One of Brittany Murphy's friend's is knocked out and lying in a hospital, but by the end of the movie we still don't know what happened to him. There are others, but I won't reveal them for fear of spoiling the plot.

At the end of he movie, I just didn't feel satisfied. This had way too much soap opera, not enough plot for a good movie.",1255737600,7,1008,4.558011049723757

3912725,3,B002DU39IK,"Cilla McGowan (Brittany Murphy) buys and moves into her grandmother's old house in Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. Being an attractive young girl she soon attracts the attention of a local fantasy magazine writer Ford Sawyer (Jason Lewis). Cilla also has an unexpected visit from her ex-husband Steve Chensky (Christian Oliver). Soon, Cilla is targeted - newly planted trees get cut down, Steve is attacked, a local man stalks her - and she turns to local detective Alvin Wilson (Mark Wilson) for help. Cilla discovers by reading old letters in the barn that her grandmother, who was a movie star and popular singer, had an affair with a local married man who made her pregnant. She also `visits' Cilla in spirit to watch over and guide her as she explores her past. Her grandmother's `suicide' seems to be more and more unlikely. There are twists and turns in the plot which makes for quite an entertaining thriller, though I wouldn't give it a top rating. The film was directed by Martha Coolidge.",1350086400,2,998,4.842105263157895

3912727,4,B002DU39IK,"This is the third Nora Robert's book based movie I have seen, and I have to say it was the best followed secondly by Angel Falls. I knew before hand that it wouldn't be as good as the book, however I like seeing characters brought to life on screen so I gave it a shot. And in this case I enjoyed it. I loved Brittany Murphy, her delivery always made me smile. Good cast all around really. Yes they had to cut a lot of the book out to fit it into the time frame but they followed the just of the book and it was still pretty darn good and entertaining. I rented it originally but now I am definitely buying it to own from Amazon.",1331424000,5,629,3.9606299212598426
3912738,4,B002DU39IK,"When I read the book I loved it. Then saw it was going to be a movie and could hardly wait. This is my favorite Roberts book to become a movie. I think they did an excellent job with fitting the story into the time limit they had to work with. Brittany Murphy was very good as Cilla.

This story is about a young lady who buys and flips homes. She was a child star from a family of actors. Her grandmother Janet was one of the most famous actresses of her time and Cilla moves into Janet's house to restore it and live there. While there she has visions of her grandmother trying to tell her the truth about her death. Cilla starts looking for clues and with the help of her neighbor and new lover Ford, she discovers her grandmother did not commit suicide as it was reported. They are searching for Janet's murderer and the murderer is trying to scare her away.

This is not a big dollar Hollywood movie. It is a made for TV movie and will not have all of the high tech that is available for a theater movie. Enjoy it for what it is. I did.",1307404800,9,1041,4.098039215686274

3912740,1,B002DU39IK,I really like Brittany I can't believe she is no longer but I was hard to watch because her lips were too big whoever did her lip job messed up big time it and you could tell she had hair extentions and the acting was not good at all. I was really surprised.  But I will watch because I'm a fan of Brittany.,1295481600,,307,3.873015873015873

I Reallly love this movie and all of the other Nora Robert movies, the only thing that I wish they were is a bit longer so more of the story could be put into the movie like the book, esp. the ones like Monata Sky, Northern Lights, and Angels Fall, but really all of the movies. They do a pretty job of staying with the book for the most part which I really do like. Because I relly hate movies that are based off of books and then are so far off the book it makes you not want to finish watching it. So for the others that gave this movie such a bad review to each is own that is their right, but you don't have to listen to them. And I had forgetten that this was Brittany Murphy's last movie before she died. She will be missed. She did a very good job on it.",1265500800,25,798,3.8719512195121952
