This DVD will show you how to play both of the above-named tunes along with such greats as Day Tripper(Beatles), Message in a Bottle(Police), Oye Como Va(Santana), Refugee(Tom Petty), Takin' Care of Business(Bachman Turner Overdrive), and Tush(ZZ Top). Doug Boduch is a talented guitarist and instructor. He deconstructs each tune into its component parts and then shows you in close-up detail how to play each part. He also offers useful advice and practice tips so that this DVD is the next best thing to having a knowledgeable and patient guitar teacher. My only beef is that I would have preferred ZZ Top's La Grange over Tush. Also, if you're going to put out a Guitar Signature Licks: Classic Rock DVD, you have to leave room for Stairway to Heaven. However, outside of those minor objections, this DVD offers sound advice and instruction and is highly recommended for all guitarists at the intermediate level or above.",1147737600,11,1088,4.886486486486486
