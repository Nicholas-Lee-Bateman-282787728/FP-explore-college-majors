6247193,5,B00I1O34YG,A very refreshing anthology more in the spirit of The Twilight Zone than the more gore-centric films out today.  Highly recommended!,1396224000,3,132,5.285714285714286
6247194,1,B00I1O34YG,"i only watched first 45 minutes or so and chose not to watch the rest.  was not what i was looking for.  the melodrama outweighed any philosophy.  the phrase ""know thyself"" is as deep as it gets.",1396224000,,195,4.216216216216216

6247196,3,B00I1O34YG,"The movie is about a man who is down on his luck working for a eccentric cowboy on a fake town where they have shows of cowboys in during the western age. The man takes a position as a janitor. Something he dislikes terribly after 2 long years in prison. As the cowboy owner talks to the man about his position, he takes him on a tour of the place and shows him old antics that has a story behind each and everyone. All connected to a gym locker with the number, ""13"".

This movie was alright. It kind of reminded me of, ""Tales from the Hood."" The only difference is the man telling a story of artifacts with a long and troubling history instead of dead corpses. I was really disappointed though. The stories went quick and I didn't get to see more of my favorite character, Tatyana Ali. I have the hots for her, so when she appeared it was like she was just a one of those nobodies that wanted to be in a movies. I was disappointed. I'm searching through my kindle now to see if there is anymore movies with her in them and if so, I hope she has a better viewing than this.",1402444800,,1074,4.114285714285714
6247197,4,B00I1O34YG,"Skip (Jason Spisak ) has spent 2 years in jail, crime unspecified. Upon his release he gets a job as the night shift janitor at a west world run by philosopher cowboy Archie (Jon Gries). While showing Skip around Archie relates to him four separate stories about how choices determine our life.

1) Tommy (Ricky Schroder) is a human punching bag who wants to be a boxer. He comes across an old set of gloves that turns him into a killer boxer.

2) Eugene (Bart Johnson) gets initiated into the Red Fez Society which takes a twist.

3) Bill (Alexander Polinsky) wants to kill himself and then meets Jack (Jason Marsden) on a roof top.

4) A hitman (Rick Hoffman) tries to determine which one of three women hired him to kill her husband.

After the four episodes are told, Skip is instructed not to go into Locker 13 which lasts about 30 seconds. He becomes our fifth story.

The stories were well acted out, but the first and fourth episodes were overly predictable. The suicide club episode really didn't twist much and didn't have anything to do with Locker 13. It appears to have been something they just tossed in. The Red Fez Society seemed more like an opportunity squandered.

It is a nice little anthology of stories. Not to be confused with the film the ""13th Unit.""

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. One of those odd ""R"" ratings for violence.",1399766400,2,1347,4.537190082644628
6247198,3,B00I1O34YG,"If you're hoping for a crazy V/H/S type movie like they claim in numerous reviews, then you are going to be REALLY disappointed.  That being said, it isn't that bad of a movie.  It's more along the lines of what you'd find on any given afternoon weekend on SyFy or TBS.  It's basically the telling of numerous stories via ""Alfred Hitchcock"" or ""The Twilight Zone"" which basically have no connection what so ever to the main storyline itself, with the exception of each character making certain ""choices"" in their life.  And, that might have fully been it's intention?  However, I was really hoping for something that would completely tie the stories together.  Instead, each of the 4 separate stories could have been it's own short without having been connected to this movie at all.  The acting was good, the writing was good, and I enjoyed each story on it's own.  I just felt that the main story lacked any real substance.

Again, I'm not really sure how it didn't get a simple ""PG"" rating, because I saw nothing in it that would require an ""R""?  It's very soft in it's violence and from what I can remember, there weren't any expletives.  Don't hold me to that, but I sure can't remember any offhand.

As I said, the stories, themselves were very well written/acted/told and it wasn't something I felt I wasted my time watching.  I read a few reviews and really was expecting something far different than what I got.  And the ""twist"" at the end, really didn't come as any surprise to me.  Not sure why, but I was honestly expecting it.  The only part I didn't understand was.......

*******SPOILERS*******

.......if he died 24 hours later, how come he didn't get rich after giving the numbers to his other self?

Either way?  Not too bad of a movie if you know what you're getting.

Final Verdict:  Check it out if it's on SyFy on the weekend.

6247199,1,B00I1O34YG,"If this has appeal to anyone, I certainly don't understand it.  I got maybe 3/4 of the way through this & couldn't take anymore.  It's disjointed and frustrating to watch, and the ""wrap around"" features this smug, philosophical goober that worked on me like nails on a chalkboard.  If this has a point, I didn't get it.  The stories were not that interesting or appealing and I just finally had to stop it and go find something rewarding to do, like clean the cat box.",1398902400,,468,4.470588235294118
6247200,1,B00I1O34YG,"...I found myself trying to understand how this could be a ""watch it before it's in theaters"" flick. After about 20 minutes I realized that I'd been had. This movie never was and never will show in a theater where the name doesn't start with ""home"".

Think of a grown up collection of Aesop fables or a long bad episode of tales from the crypt.",1398211200,,344,4.292307692307692
6247201,5,B00I1O34YG,"When I first read the press release for this film, I didn't pick up on the fact that it is an anthology.  Like V/H/S and its sequel, this film weaves several horror shorts into one overarching storyline.  And again, like V/H/S, this film is an outright hit.  If you like THE TWILIGHT ZONE, TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE, or TALES FROM THE CRYPT, then you're going to love LOCKER 13!

This film blew me away; I was hoping it would be good, but I didn't expect it to be this good!  It pulled me in from the opening scenes and never let go.  As a result, 95 minutes flew by, and the credits were rolling before I even knew it.

Each segment of LOCKER 13 is shot well and looks great onscreen.  And despite the fact there are five directors, the pieces of the film are sewn together with such precision that its difficult to tell who directed what.  The fact that there is no noticeable difference in directing styles is a true testament to the talent of the creators.

The acting is top-notch as well.  I particularly enjoyed Ricky Schroders performance as the boxer, Rick Hoffman as the hit-man, Jon Gries as Archie, and Jason Spisak as Skip.  The rest of the cast does an excellent job in their roles as well, and it is nice to see such a diverse group of actors in a project like this.

The stories in LOCKER 13 are the real winners here, though.  Each one kept me guessing until the end, especially the main storyline involving Archie and Skip.  I had no idea what to expect, but I was certainly not disappointed when the ending came about!  The writers of this film (and the shorts) are all to be commended.  I will definitely be keeping tabs on their future works.

LOCKER 13 is a major win for me and highly recommend giving it a look.  Even if you're not a horror fan, you have to check this one out if only for the originality of the writing.  The film hits store shelves in a bit over a week, so make a note.",1397779200,3,1909,4.264623955431754
6247202,5,B00I1O34YG,"There's something for everyone waiting inside Locker 13! Told with a slight ""Twilight Zone"" flair, but with plenty of originality and interest. You might wish some of the individual stories were a bit longer, but the writers knew just when to end each one.

Not too may bad words and no nudity or extreme graphic violence, so I would recommend for ages 15 and older. Adult audiences should find this compilation of mystery and suspense (and a bit of wickedness) a pleasure to watch. I'm ready for a second viewing, since I'm sure I missed a few things the first time!",1396915200,8,567,4.6138613861386135

8638289,1,B00I1O34YG,"Subpar addition to the recent resurgence of the horror anthology that counts way to much on fairly predictable twist endings. Phoned in acting from some people who should know better like Schroder and Gries sink any potential for a standout. Stick with V/H/S, Southbound, or any other stronger example of the sub genre.",1478995200,,319,5.037735849056604

8638292,3,B00I1O34YG,"I gave this anthology type of movie an okay only because only 2 of the 5 stories were any good at all. I should have gone only 2 stars but the 2 that I liked, I really did like. The first one with Ricky Schroeder as a washed up boxer who gets a pair of gloves that turn him into a killer was very good, the 3rd one about a man trying to kill himself until Jason Marsden shows up is also very good. The fez society, the hitman and the final locker 13 reflection ones are dull and predictable.",1435363200,,491,3.92

8638295,5,B00I1O34YG,Great movie that definitely makes you think after you've finished watching. If you're not in to the Twilight Zone or shows/movies like that then maybe it's not for you. I would definitely recommend watching!,1408924800,,207,5.117647058823529
