2756934,5,B000N60H9U,"I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter who, for some reason has developed a crush on Michael J. Fox. After collecting the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy, and both volumes of the ""Spin City"" DVD's, this collection was an economical way to expand her back catalog of films Michael J. Fox has starred in. 4 movies for under $15 ?  How can you go wrong?  One can only hope that someday soon ""Light Of Day"", the movie he starred in with Joan Jett will be made available on DVD. That, and the entire ""Spin City"" series.  Until then,  this collect is, and will remain, highly recommended.",1219622400,12,585,4.388888888888889

2756955,5,B000N60H9U,"Bought this for the same price as the single movie in the collection - that I was after; GREEDY!

The movie Greedy is SO CLEVER and all of the cast - so very humorous!  This movie can't really be described outside of the already present description without a SPOILER -  Watch the movie.... it's delightful - revealing ALL THE ANTICS those 'dear' relatives will go through... to inherit your fortune!",1423526400,,399,4.671428571428572

2756965,5,B000N60H9U,These are great 80's Michael J Fox movies. I can watch these over and over. Some of the best 80's shows,1402617600,,103,3.9523809523809526
2756966,5,B000N60H9U,Bought this for my 14 year old granddaughter who is over the moon with 80s movies and Michael J. Fox in particular.  She loved that so many good movies were on one disk.  Quite a value.,1401148800,,185,4.111111111111111

2756971,5,B000N60H9U,"The long and the short of it! There is no film in which I am not always entertained by Michael J. Fox This collection of 4 films is great and I add to a few others I also own. GREEDY, s a film I saw for the first time earlier in the year on cable. Aside from Michael being Michael [always so damn lovable & dependable to make you smile], KIRK DOUGLAS gives a bravo performance as a crotchety old very very rich man with predatory condescending vulturous relatives. EVERYTHING Michael is worth the buy.",1388448000,,501,4.28421052631579
2756972,5,B000N60H9U,"Quality was prefect in play mode, no issues at all !!!  -- I rate it PG only because there is one nude-topless scene near the beginning.  Mine was english version, great condition I'm extremely happy.  No R-Rated language at all. Great down to earth movie with nothing fancy just a plain common story line about  a little old country town. Sorry I think this is a  great movie fit for any age and it plain and simple every day life in a sleepy little town.  People complain on here about the movie, Sorry if your expecting --F this and --F that with hardcore cum-sex, drugs and guns and drinking...then you will be extremely disappointed.  Personally I think it a  great movie.",1387929600,,677,4.537190082644628
2756973,3,B000N60H9U,"It shocks me that not many of Michael J. Fox's classic comedy films are available on Blu-ray. This 3-disc DVD collection meets the need because you get 4 good films (Secret of My Success, The Hard Way, For Love or Money, Greedy). Secret of My Success is by far the best. It has a great cast, it's hilarious and the music is enjoyable. Fans should also check out the Back to the Future trilogy and Teen Wolf on Blu-ray. My only complaint is that the bonus features in this set are light (consisting of trailers, cast bios, and production notes). I rate the films 4 stars but this release gets 3 stars. A Blu-ray collection of these films loaded with extras would rate higher. At this price, this comedy collection is well worth the money.",1378857600,,737,4.466666666666667
2756974,5,B000N60H9U,"All these Videos work every good, so its worth the money your spend.

2756975,5,B000N60H9U,"Michael J Fox is known best for his back to the future or teen wolf movies characters but I think these four movies define him in a different light I love him in all four but my two favorites in this collection is the secret to my success and for love or money,  great movies to add to any movie buffs  library",1374710400,,310,3.9838709677419355
2756976,5,B000N60H9U,"We love everything he does, but were tired of just seeing Spin City reruns over and over!  His movies are fun and light, perfect for Sunday afternoons.",1372896000,,151,4.592592592592593
2756977,5,B000N60H9U,how can you go wrong with Michael J Fox movies- all of his moves are just that some are better then others,1366848000,,106,3.8636363636363638
2756978,5,B000N60H9U,The four movies on here are great for the family and are really worth the price. Awesome set to own.,1357084800,,100,4.05
2756979,5,B000N60H9U,Michael J Fox is a great actor and I love his movies.  I recommend this DVD.  Good price and good to have this collection.,1356739200,,122,4.041666666666667
2756980,3,B000N60H9U,By far not his finest work. Though getting two movies for the price of one  compensated for the marginal movies,1355616000,,111,4.55
2756981,5,B000N60H9U,"Product was tremendous value--4 dvds for less than price of one!  (And fun.)  The Hard Way was a little too hyper  for me, but the others were great.",1351728000,,149,4.25
2756982,4,B000N60H9U,"I enjoyed all four of the movies,I really enjoyed The Secret of My Success. The four movie dvd pack is well worth the money.",1351209600,,124,4.208333333333333
2756983,5,B000N60H9U,"I like ""The Secret of My Success"" and had it on video and finally decided to pick up a DVD copy. Ended up picking up all 4 movies in this collection for around $9. 3 separate DVDs contain the 4 movies. Watched ""The Secret of My Success"" last night with no problems. Container is fancier than another 4 movie collection I picked up at the same time and as a Michael J. Fox fan, I look forward to watching the other movies. Don't expect many extra features on the DVDs though - with some older movies, there probably weren't any beyond the trailer anyway.",1344211200,,553,4.326923076923077
2756984,5,B000N60H9U,"First, all four are fantastic and ""Greed"" seems to be the at the center of the plot in all four, one way or the other, be it love or money. The Best by far is Greedy, one of the best films ever made. The writer and director did a fantastic job of making it dance through the steps of pulling the greedy realitives up and down and when it all washes out there isn't much left in the bottom of the sieve. Take a look see, you will love it.

2756985,3,B000N60H9U,"Michael J. Fox is a pleasant and personable chap and I've seen him on TV a few times recently, but I had never seen any of his movies. As such, I found a ""Michael J. Fox Comedy Favorites Collection"" on the bargain rack at my local Ross Store and I picked it up. Four movies resided in a nicely presented packet of three CDs (two movies were on one of the CDs). I've been viewing them as late-night entertainment over the past few weeks. I have mixed feelings about the packet. All the movies have high production values, I should add. And Michael J. Fox has a large following of fans. I just didn't care all that much for the movies, especially two of them. I reviewed all of the movies under their individual titles and this review is for the total package.

""The Hard Way"" was one of the Funnier selections. Fox played a TV tough-guy cop (somewhat like Dirty Harry) who needed to get his act brightened up and paired with a real live Dirty-Harry-Style NYC detective, much to the detectives disgust. It had it's humorous moments. Perhaps the best of the movies was ""Greed"" in which Fox teamed up with Kirk Douglas in an examination of family values. It was funny, but also half serious. I saw both of these movies as being four-star rated. ""The Secret Of My Success"" had Fox as a mail-room boy who manipulated himself into the upper corporate ranks. It just wasn't believable. ""For Love or Money"" had Fox as an upper-scale hotel concierge. This movie lacked believability also. In these latter two movies. the last third of the movies really dragged and I had trouble finishing them. I rated them as threes and twos. All in all, the movie set was a mixed experience and I doubt that I would buy further Fox DVDs, although he certainly has a large contingent of fans who enjoy his offerings.
