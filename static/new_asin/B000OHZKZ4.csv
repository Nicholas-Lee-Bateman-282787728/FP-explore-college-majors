2794876,5,B000OHZKZ4,"Another great season of Monk.  Great writing, great episodes.

This set also has the pilot for Psych.  I ran out and bought it too.  If you like Monk, you'll like Psych too.  Get the package deal on the two and save.",1185148800,,216,4.170731707317073
2794877,5,B000OHZKZ4,"The 5th season of the OC detective continues to provide insight, delightful comedy, pathos, and excellent acting by the entire cast.  Monk continue to delight.  Writing is sharp and witty, performances are clean and the cast is seamless in working off oneanother.
I find the show tends to get a bit morose when it comes to Monk's loss of his wife, however, when they shoot for just plan fun detective work, they outshine the rest.",1184457600,,430,4.72
2794878,2,B000OHZKZ4,"The first four seasons were TERRIFIC overall, but only a few of Season 5's episodes measure up to that standard. The plots are predominantly less complex and less interesting, and some of the characters are more annoying than funny. Do they have a new writer? Please bring back the old one!
By all means, buy Season 1 through 4, but think twice about 5, or at least wait for a super discount.
Unfortunately, the opening episode of Season 6 shows no sign of a comeback.",1184457600,6,468,4.517647058823529
2794879,3,B000OHZKZ4,"Why is it in recent years that the producers of successful television shows frequently allow writers to screw around with the successful formula which gave them a winning in the first place?  We are big fans of this series, which we only view on DVD since it is the only way we can get it.  We eagerly awaited the fifth season, and have gone through it one episode after the other since we received the set.  It was a big letdown compared to the previous four years.  There may be more to it, but it seems the major problem is a significant drop in the quality of writing.  While our view at this point is that ""bad Monk is better than no Monk at all,"" that's not much of a recommendation. It would be good if the people in charge of this show could clean up their act and get interested in it again, or turn the show over to better handlers.  This show could be a cash cow for many more years in the right hands, assuming loyal followers are not driven away.",1183334400,21,959,4.184782608695652
2794880,5,B000OHZKZ4,"Season five of Monk continues to bring us the cases and struggles of Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) as he struggles to solve crimes despite his OCD and many phobias.  This season finds Monk facing new issues in the same old way.

When the city garbage workers go on strike, it's up to Monk to solve a murder to get everything cleaned up.  His assistant Natalie (Traylor Howard) convinces Monk to strike out on his own and open a private eye business.  Monk's 25 year class reunion at Berkley involves a painful stroll down memory lane and the murder of a nurse.  When Captain Stottlemeyer's (Ted Levine) son skips school to attend a rock concert, Monk finds a dead man in an outhouse.  And in a ""Wings"" reunion, Steven Weber plays a shock jock that may have killed his wife.  He just has the perfect alibi; he was on the air at the time.

This season featured two episodes at aired during the hiatus between parts of the season.  In the first, Monk finally meets his dad, a trucker who needs Monk's help to solve a murder.  The second is very interesting.  ""Mr. Monk and the Leper"" was originally shown in black and white and color.  It's a very noirish tale, and the black and white color scheme really adds to the episode.  Both versions, including their original introductions are included in the set.

As always, this season provided many fun character moments and some hilarious situations.  At times, the characters can become cartoonish.  This felt especially true near the beginning of the season.  But the actors do a great job of keeping things believable and human.

Since the set has both the black and white and color versions of the one episode, there are 17 episodes in this four disc set.  Extras include an audio commentary (a first for the series) on the black and white version of ""Mr. Monk and the Leper.""  Disc four contains some hilarious ""webisodes"" that premiered on line.  I know I've seen at least one used as a promo on TV, however.  Finally, there's the pilot of ""Psych,"" a similar comedic mystery.

Monk isn't for everyone.  But anyone who is a fan will love the latest set.",1183248000,13,2100,4.583333333333333
2794881,5,B000OHZKZ4,"Since I refuse to schedule my life by television, I had to wait until this season came out on DVD to enjoy it. Plus, watching the DVDs gives you so many more features than waiting each week for the next episode. I pre-ordered this season and waited anxiously for it to arrive, and wasn't disappointed.

Oddly enough, I was surprised again at how much more Natalie (Mr. Monk's assistant) suits the part than did his previous assistant/nurse, Sharona. I think it's her background, and a good bit of personality. Like Monk, she has lost a spouse tragically, which enables her to empathize with him a bit more whenever the subject of Trudy, his deceased wife, comes up. I hope she stays with him for a long time.

I was glad to see Ted Levine's character, Captain Stottlemeyer, move on after his wife left him in the previous season. She caused irritation in every episode she appeared.

Other than those observations, season 5 is as good as any previous season, and shows no sign of slowing down. If they keep making them like this, I'll keep buying them and highly recommending them. It has to be about the best TV out there today.",1183161600,4,1129,4.579207920792079
2794882,5,B000OHZKZ4,"I have always been a big fan of the USA original series, Monk. So when Monk season 5 was released I immediately set out to purchase it and trust me, you will not be disappointed with this season. Season five comes on 4 disks and 16 episodes, including:

Mr. Monk and the Actor:
A famous actor plays Monk in a movie about the obsessive compulsive detective. However, the more he spends time with Monk, the more Natalie grows concerned about how the actor's behavior takes a weird turn. He also gets too involved in a murder case Monk is currently trying to solve.

Mr. Monk and the Garbage Strike:
When a union boss' death threatens to prolong a city-wide garbage strike in San Francisco, it's up to Monk to help end the strike by determining whether the boss' death was suicide or murder. It also is very funny to see Monk try to clean up the city by himself.

Mr. Monk and the Big Game:
Julie and her friends hire Monk to look into the suspicious death of their basketball coach. Monk isn't too sure and soon realizes the case may have one twist even he wouldnt have seen coming.

Mr. Monk Cant See and Thing:
Mr. Monk looses his eyesight after a bizarre altercation with a murder suspect in a fire station. Determined not to let it disable him, he continues on to solve the case.

Mr. Monk, Private Eye:
When Natalie convinces Monk to go into business as a private eye, his first case is a small fender bender that leads to a far more dangerous investigation that involves plenty of twists.

Mr. Monk and the Class Reunion:
Monk attends his college reunion and uncovers a complex murder plot against one of his former classmates. Pretty cool episode in my opinion.

Mr. Monk Gets a New Shrink:
When Dr. Kroger retires after his cleaning lady is killed in his own office, it's up to Monk to solve the case and get Dr. Kroger back to work as soon as possible, or Monk may not make it.

Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert:
Monk goes to a rock concert to look for Captain Stottlemeyer's son and finds himself in the middle of a murder investigation.

Mr. Monk Meets his Dad:
One of my favorite episodes in this season. When Monk's truck driving father rolls into town at Christmastime, Monk joins him on the road, where they stumble across a mystery that even Monk may not be able to solve.

Mr. Monk and the Leper:
A missing millionaire suffering from leprosy comes out of hiding to hire Monk, who soon finds himself in the middle of a murder investigation as well as realizing different stories may have one common, mysterious, factor.

Mr. Monk Makes a Friend:
An easy going guy named Hal bumps into Monk at a grocery store, and the two become fast friends. For the first time in his life, Monk appears to have a buddy. However Hal may not be all that he appears to be...

Mr. Monk is at Your Service:
When Natalie suspects foul play in the deaths of her parents' wealthy neighbors, Monk goes undercover as a butler to investigate

Mr. Monk is on the Air:
In one of the better episodes Monk goes toe to toe with a popular radio shock jock who is suspected of killing his wife.

Mr. Monk Visits a Farm:
When Lt. Disher inherits a farm from an uncle who committed suicide, he decides to quit the police force and start a new life in the country. But Disher soon suspects that his uncle was murdered, so Monk joins him on the farm to investigate.

Mr. Monk and the Really, Really Dead Guy:
When a dangerous criminal named the ""Six Way Killer"" strikes in San Francisco, Monk has to match his detective skills against the flashy forensic technology of a federal agent as they both pursue the murderer.

Mr. Monk Goes to the Hospital:
Monk goes to the hospital with a bloody nose, but when a doctor in the hospital turns up dead, Monk joins the murder investigation, and soon his own life is in grave danger.

This is definately worth your money. Adrian Monk is awesome to watch and some of the episodes are really very clever and all are completely original. Highly recommended...",1182816000,39,3973,4.442916093535076
2794883,5,B000OHZKZ4,"If you know Monk, you know that Season Five is irresistable! Monk is the best series I have ever encountered! Hilarious is the best way of describing Monk. Tony is an amazing actor. If you want some family fun, PLEASE, watch Monk. You'll thank me later.",1180224000,15,253,4.521739130434782
2794884,4,B000OHZKZ4,"Most cult TV dies pretty quickly, but Adrian Monk has been charming viewers with his quirky detecting for five seasons now. The fifth season occasionally crosses the line into cartoonishness, but overall it's still an entertaining, amusing little detective show... with the world's only OCD detective.

In the opening episode, a movie is going to be made about Monk's (Tony Shalhoub) life and amazing abilities, with well-known actor David Ruskin (Stanley Tucci) as Monk. But Ruskin turns out to be the world's best method actor, as he observes Monk doing his detective work -- and starts to acquire Monk's OCD and personality. Sometimes acting can be TOO good.

But Monk's problems don't cease when he's paralyzed by a garbage strike, and the strike leader is murdered. Other cases include a mysterious electrocution in a gym shower, being blinded by a murderer, a stint as a private eye, a college reunion, a disastrous rock concert, a leper, posing as a butler, a radio host whose wife died while he was on the air, and he competes against technology to find a serial killer.

On the personal front, Monk gets reacquainted with his father, who left the family when he was a child, and he also tries to deal with Dr. Kroger's early retirement, by solving the crime that prompted him to leave. And he helps Randy (Jason Gray-Stanford ) out when the latter inherits a farm -- and a mysterious death.

The fifth season does sag a little in the middle -- the retirement and rocker episodes have Monk's OCD becoming almost cartoonishly comic. But most of the rest of the episodes are quite good, with the typical unsolvable cases, unbreakable alibis, and inexplicable phobias from poor Monk.

Writingwise, there's nothing to complain about -- solid writing, solid plots full of difficult mysteries, and Monk undergoing lots of stress as he tries to deal with his many phobias. The dialogue is top-notch (""There's never hope. I wish I drank. Is it wonderful?""), and the writers allow all the regular characters to shine now and again, including Randy and Stottlemeyer (who have a kind of big-brother/little-brother vibe).

Tony Shalhoub is just amazing here, as Monk tries to navigate the dangers of a dirty, random world. He's absolutely hilarious when poor Monk has to square dance, feed chickens, and single-handedly tries to clean up San Francisco. But he also gives us some truly beautiful moments, such as when we see Monk watching his wedding video, quietly crying.

Traylor Howard continues to give a solid performance as Monk's assistant, while Ted Levine and Gray-Stanford round off the regular cast as the kindly Stottlemeyer and naive Randy. Alice Cooper has a fun cameo, and Tucci is absolutely great as a Monk-impersonator. And Sean Astin gives a glorious performance as a murderous, spoiled rich brat.

The fifth season of ""Monk"" has a few episodes that are lacking, but most of them are still excellent, suspenseful little mysteries. Definitely worth seeing.",1174521600,122,2970,4.997975708502024

2794917,5,B000OHZKZ4,"As with previous seasons, Monk does not disappoint. In all honesty, the episode, ""Monk Gets A New Shrink"" is worth the cost of the entire DVD. Although the critics felt this was a weak episode, this one had me in constant laughter. Amusing as it was to see him go through the 5 stages of grief in a matter of seconds, what was even more hilarious was the inside look of Dr. Kroger's family dynamic. Instead of observing a very happy family, the doctor and his wife seem to have their hands full with a very disturbed, rebellious son who insists on having his DNA tested repeatedly to prove he is their biological child.  Add Harold and his competitive thirst for Dr. Kroger's full time attention and devotion, and you have the recipe for success!

Needless to say, this is a must get DVD!",1494460800,,788,4.465277777777778
2794918,5,B000OHZKZ4,This show is loads of fun to watch.  I especially enjoy seeing him get the best of the bully or bad guy.  He is obviously impaired with his obsessive/compulsive tendencies and the bad guy thinks he has found a weakness in the investigation and he/she will get away with it.  They are always wrong.  The creators and writers come up with impossible situations where Monk cannot possibly be right about his conclusion as to who did it.  The fun is in seeing how he hones in on little details that give away the villain and how he/she did it.  So very entertaining to watch.  Tony Shalhoub is remarkable as Monk.  He is such a versatile actor.  Season Five is great as is all of the other seasons.,1494115200,,694,4.4015748031496065

2794945,2,B000OHZKZ4,"I rate the show five stars, but I found the Amazon video quality disappointing.

When I saw Monk on sale on Amazon video, I bought Season 5 since I already had the first four seasons on DVD, however I found the video to be blurry.  I thought it was my eyes at first and waited for the video to clear up but it never did.  I have bought and watched other videos from Amazon and never encountered this problem.  I thought maybe it was just season 5, so I went ahead and bought season 6 and it had the same problem.

I then took out and watched my season 1 DVD and the picture looked fine to me (not blurry) though it's SD.  So I thought maybe they're somehow messing up the HD picture by trying to enhance it, and bought season 7 in SD instead of HD.  Disappointingly, not only it was blurry but fuzzy as well.  But I suppose the picture wasn't any worse since the fuzziness kind of masked out the blurriness.  I suppose my eyes are sensitive (and I'm picky) because I haven't seen anybody else comment on this problem.

Note: it's Amazon's policy not to refund video downloads, but the particular customer service person I chatted with decided to give me a refund since I am a ""valuable customer"".

I then tried buying Monk on Vudu since it was on sale there also.  Season 1 (episode 1) looked fine to me -- sharper than the DVD.  Season 5 (episode 1) seemed a little blurry to me at times, but better than on Amazon.  Season 6 (episode 1) seemed a little grainy, but clear enough.  So Monk on Vudu looks superior to me than on Amazon.

I normally buy Amazon Video instead of Vudu since Vudu is not available on Fire TV or Fire tablets (I switch to my Roku to watch Vudu on TV).  Also I prefer Amazon's captions to Vudu's.  But in this particular case, I went with Vudu since their video is superior to my eyes.

Monk completists will want the DVDs as well, since they contain special features that are not provided on Amazon Video or Vudu.",1483228800,,1939,4.263013698630137

It states that he went back to England to play the role of Hamlet,  rather than the role of Nr. Monk. which was too ""dark"".",1453507200,,400,4.1558441558441555

2795098,4,B000OHZKZ4,"Although all of the Monk DVDs are excellent, episode one of season 5 is outstanding...especially if you are interested in acting.  At the beginning, a movie studio decides to make a movie about Monk. The person playing the part of Monk gets involved with Monk's life to study his character, mannerisms, etc.  It is fascinating to see how a great actor would work -- probing his way into Monk's psyche, getting deeper than even Monk's shrink ever did. Through this constant probing,  the ACTOR actually  reveals something that Monk has never spoken of to anyone - the secret that is the key to  Monk's emotional disorder. It's most amazing that the secret is revealed by the actor, Not Monk! The reason, I believe, is that the psyche's of the two men had become blended as one and the actor instinctually knew Monk's hidden thoughts.  Finally, the actor is satisfied that he now has what he needs to HONESTLY  portray Monk on the screen.",1433635200,2,936,4.705521472392638

Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Throughout this season Monk deals with a garbage strike, loses his eyesight, attends his college reunion, goes to a rock concert, finally meets his dad, goes on the air, and much more.

I wasn't too keen on the first two episodes ('Mr Monk & the Actor' & 'Mr Monk & the Garbage Strike') which I thought were just a little bit silly, but apart from that minor speed bump this season rocks.

2795434,5,B000OHZKZ4,"As always, Monk delivers an outstanding performance of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Detective).  Sharona was enjoyable, but I find I like Natalie as his long suffering assistant even more for her spirited responses and believable care for Monk's self-inflicted predicaments.  Stottlemeyer, while not the greatest actor around, is still convincing as the empathetic but grouchy police captain.  Randy, as his assistant, gets funnier all the time. As a whole, the entire series just keeps getting better!  But what I like the best about Mr. Monk is that he is saying it's ok to be less than perfect.",1230595200,3,594,5.15625

Each episode, while each has the same theme of cracking an impossible case by a challenged ex-policeman, is fresh.  For the most part, the evidence is there for all of us to figure out if we could put it together.  Mr. Monk is an endearing character.  The chemistry is just right among the characters to weave a fabric of entertainment from beginning to end.  There are few loose ends. Over the years I have caught a few minutes of an episode on free TV and when the commercial came on, I switched channels.  It was not until I purchased the DVD that I found out how wonderful this series is.  I found this true of a number of TV series like ""NYPD Blue"" ""Picket Fences"" etc.  What have I been watching for the last 10 years.......Commercials.  Free TV and now cable and satellite TV are nothing more than advertisements for TV shows to be purchased. I go to the library and get the DVD free for the first season to find if I like it.  Since libraries do not carry the latests TV DVDs, I buy the rest on Amazon or eBay.  1/2 the time Amazon is less expensive than eBay.  I buy used as much as possible and then sell them on eBay so the cost to me is very close to the auction cost.  Sure beats paying a cable bill.",1224028800,2,1346,4.166666666666667
2795438,1,B000OHZKZ4,"My good ness, look at all the glowing reviews. I gave this one star just to offset the rating a little. Honestly I would have given 2 stars. I have been a fan of Monk since the beginning. I loved seasons 1& 2. Season 3 was pretty good as well, but not as good as the previous two. Season 4 started to fall off. My wife and I though there were at least 6 or 7 throw away episodes. Also the show got considerably sillier. Season 5 has done it for me. I just tinished the last episode and I am officially over ""Monk"". The writing on this show has gone so downhill it's not even funny. It has become a silly almost farcical satire. It was not this silly in the first two seasons I'm sorry. It had humor, yes but it was fresh and the storylines took center stage and Monk was an interesting Character. Season five consisted of recycled plots, recycled jokes and every character has become more of a caricature. Stottlemeyer and Disher have become especially absurd when they could have been explored more as charaters. Really sad. Monk was a nice gimmick for a while and great writing could have kept it afloat. However this has not been the case whatsoever. The writing has become abysmal.

2795439,2,B000OHZKZ4,this series was is appointing in many ways. I bought it because it was so many minutes of my favorite series but it was not worth the money. It had a repeated episode (Monk meets the Lepord). It was not even that good of a story. They wanted to show it in black and white and color what a waste. There was not that many episodes. The only saving factor was the Psyco bonus episode. In conclusion it is not worth the effort to buy or watch. I hope season 6 is better.,1219190400,4,466,4.021505376344086

2795441,5,B000OHZKZ4,"In the fifth season of this series, Mr. Monk and his colleagues keep evolving despite his being stuck with all the OCDs he has had since the beginning.  He's still seeing Dr. Kroger but little progress has been made.  Still, Monk manages to solve cases that no one else can, even outwitting the expensive gadgetry used in ""Mr. Monk and the really, really dead guy.""
The appealing detective Randy Disher gets more to do this season, while Julie Teeger teaches Mr. Monk the finer points of email so he can try to join the 21st century.
 The final episode has Monk beaten up and nearly killed by a doctor in a hospital, but Natalie arrives in time to save him, as she frequently does.
Monk is still obsessing on Trudy, but I suspect that he might become interested in someone else eventually.  I'll know for sure after viewing season six.",1216425600,2,835,4.546666666666667

(Seventeen episodes, if you count both the B&W and color versions of ""The Leper"".)

Aside from a comedic make-out scene, a reference to a ""sex affair"" (both in ""the Leper""), and some mild swearing throughout it's as family-friendly as ever. (Thank you USAnetwork!)

The mysteries are still challenging and creative. (Keep an eye out for clues!)

As for the DVDs themselves, the quality is excellent. All episodes are in widescreen.

The only way at all that this product is lacking is the sparse special-features. The brief webisodes are odd and don't fit the style of normal Monk episodes at all.

The additional Psych episode is neither here nor there unless you have a strong opinion concerning the show. (I hate it. :P)

However, the commentary over Mr. Monk and the Leper is priceless and very enjoyable. It's worth sitting through the episode a second time.

I love Monk.  I have watched him on TV whenerver I can from the first.  I love the way he does the Sherlock Holmes style of detecting.  It is all so logical and carefully studied as opposed to agressive cop style detective work.

I would like to see him get cured of most of his phobias and get back on the force as a real detective.  Sometimes the silliness of his phobias overpowers the detecting part of the plays.  Maybe he could get mostly cured and get on the force and still be a little strange.",1193616000,2,653,5.29126213592233

2795472,5,B000OHZKZ4,"And Monk alone
Whilst I am a fan of Mr Monk with Sharona, since that team embodied the original concept of the series, this season has been very good as a way of showing how Tony Shalhoub is the master at working his character.
Stand out episodes in a group of great works include, Mr Monk and the Actor, Mr Monk and the Garbage Strike, Mr Monk and the Class Reunion, Mr Monk Meets his Dad, and Mr Monk Goes to Hospital. Each of these key episodes show either emotional key points, or emotional depth to Monk that only Tony seems to be able to illustrate. The Most striking visual for me is when Mr Monk is alone and watching such happy times of his wedding to Trudy, when earlier he had shown how miserable his childhood had been. In Mr Monk meets his Dad, Dan Hedaya brings a swing bridge to Monks life to show just how special he was and is in life.
It still strikes me that it is only Sharona who has acted as a Good counterpoint to Monks depth. Traylor is not up to the demands of the original characters role, so she is in as a fifth wheel.
I challenge any first season fan to watch that and then go straight to this season and say they have the same product outside of Monk. I was glad to See Tony recently in 1408 and he showed his skill there.
THE DVD: The Bonus Features... Webisodes, kinda cute but not a good add on. The Commentary was not that great. And as much as I like PSYCH, just why was this added ??? I would have preferred MORE Monk  material.",1192492800,2,1464,4.136842105263158

2795484,2,B000OHZKZ4,"This season is, sadly to say, the worst yet.  In a downhill pattern from season to season, Monk has gotten worse and worse.

Reasons for believing this:  The character Monk is no longer funny or even that amusing.  Instead, the character gets more and more depressing.  I realize OCD is not ""funny"", but this show was meant to be somewhat comical.
Another character who has been getting worse is lieutenant Disher(?).  He's become too moronic to be believable as a cop, let alone a lieutenant.  I realize cops aren't the brightest, but this is pushing the envelope.
Thirdly, the fact that Monk (or anybody else on the show) has never found his wife's killer is getting old.  There's no reason to keep this going.  Make a two-episode show out of it.  Do whatever, but just end this.  Monk will still be Monk and maybe this would be a turn in the right direction (i.e. from depressing back to comical, with every now and then, a sad moment in the show).

The show Psych seems to be taking Monk's place and the show Monk will soon be weeded out unless something changes in the writing.",1191196800,6,1082,4.520618556701031

2795504,4,B000OHZKZ4,"Recovering from surgery recently,  I found myself watching episode after episode of MONK, a show I had long heard about but had yet to see.  I don't subscribe to cable, but a  friend loaned me Season 5, so that was my first exposure to the series.  I had long been curious about the show ands wondered how a series about a detective with OCD could be handled with any degree of sensitivity at all.  It seemed like you'd have to either have to wantonly play the disability up for cheap laughs OR you'd have to be so PC about OCD that it would appear to be little more than a personality quirk.

Well, the real answer was neither, of course.  For the most part,  the writers, directors--and certainly the actors--have pulled off this delicate feat by making the title character so likeable and human--and  so downright brilliant--that you can't help but love and admire the guy.  He's as brilliant as Sherlock Holmes even as he exceeds that  character in terms of sheer neurosis.

So MONK would seem to be as original and as entertaining as almost anything else currently  on TV (although, admittedly,  I'm guessing there since I don't really watch very much at all).  What I do garner from reading the other reviews posted here, however, is that  Season 5 may be the season where the show ""jumped the shark"" (or at least  approached the dorsal fin).  And I can guess why that is.  There were a number of intriguing episodes (""Mr. Monk and the Leper"" with its film noir feel;  ""Mr Monk and the Actor"" featured a great turn by Stanley Tucci;  ""Mr. Monk Meets His Dad"" was an interesting change of pace, with  a solid Dan Hedaya guesting as the elder Monk).  Lots of wonderful moments to convince even a neophyte (and somewhat skeptical) viewer like me that this was a witty and stylish series.

But I could also see some weaknesses here and there.  ""Mr. Monk and the Class Reunion""  was a series entry that  showed up some of its potential weaknesses.  The episode's premise was certainly intriguing,  and almost any episode that focuses on Monk's devotion to his deceased wife Trudy is going to give Tony Shalhoub a chance to dig a little deeper into his quirky character.  But the story was convoluted to the point of being almost baroque.  To solve it,  Monk had to display abilities that went beyond the keenly insightful and into the nearly psychic.  (And isn't that another show entirely? One whose pilot is included in this package?)  ""Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert"" seemed a somewhat strained attempt at presenting Monk as even more of a fish out of water than usual.  Had the resolution also not been a strain (of credibility),  all this might have been forgivable, but as it was,  the episode had an ""air"" of desperation about it.

But by and large, this viewer was won over.  If seasons one through four are actually better than I'd have to say that this series seems to have had a pretty decent run.  I can't wait to start catching up.  As for the future,  well,  I did invite myself over to a friend's house to catch some of the current season's episodes, and yes,  it could well be that that shark has been jumped (and it must have been terrifying for poor Adrian).  If the rock concert seemed strained,  ""Mr Monk and the Rapper"" was much worse.  Just plain dumb, I'd call it.  Monk is ALWAYS out of his element:  you don't need him up onstage attempting to ""rhyme"" with Snoop Dogg to show how ill at ease he is in today's world.

But at least,  there's a backlog of four seasons worth of episodes to catch up on.  If the future is iffy, well, I can look forward to catching up with the past.",1186876800,2,3605,4.484567901234568
2795505,3,B000OHZKZ4,"This season opens with a few strong episodes, but decays quickly.  By the end you're wincing: the crime plots occupy only a few minutes of each episode (with less cleverness and more obvious ""holes"" than ever before).  The characters have become like parodies of themselves.  Monk himself becomes just something to laugh at, not to empathize with.  Some episodes just hurt to watch.

They've also made some large-scale decisions (reuniting Monk with his father, for instance) that required careful handling and handled them recklessly.  Anyone who has seen the Monk-Ambrose episodes will cringe at the way Monk sells out his brother in order to bring the reunion to a tidy conclusion.  Even the FBI men, who were always cardboard foils to Monk, have become so ridiculous that there's no pleasure in seeing them get theirs.

There's comedy here, but it's not the witty, brainy comedy of the early seasons--it's more like what you would see in a slapstick movie for kids.  I'm glad some others enjoyed it--I'll continue to watch in hopes that it will recover--but it left my wife and me depressed.",1186617600,5,1095,4.939890710382514
2795506,3,B000OHZKZ4,"For some reason, Monk is more annoying than funny in season 5.  What were amusing quirks have now become annoying distractions.  Either the humor has become predictable over time, or the timing of the scripts has gone off.  The stories seem to take too much effort at trying to be funny, setting up situations for Monk's quirks instead of letting them happen from the normal flow of the story.  Re-viewing seasons 1 to 4 points towards the season 5 scripts as the problem. And the mysteries are so far fetched that it is useless to play along with the detective work.  The solution will be totally absurd.

There are still a few enjoyable episodes, and Monk's new partner fits in well. I would wait for a $19.99 special to get this.",1186099200,12,732,4.549618320610687

Looks like they need to hire a bunch of creative writers. With few more seasons with this kind of quality, will surely drive away all of the Monk fans.

Replacing ""Sharona"" with ""Natalie"" couldn't have been easy but the writers and actors blend that change very smoothly and the continuity was not lost and even made it a better show. Captain Stottlemeyer's disintegrating marriage and subsequent relationship added a new side to the captain. Randy Disher as sidekick added a quirky comedic side to the show. And of course, Monk's sad but smart, in-depth character is really the anchor for this creative, smart and touching show.
