- a job he decidedly does not want - after falling for the daughter of the current, retiring holder of that position.

Anti death penalty in a quiet way, it also makes good fun of political bureaucracy and family.  If not
on a level with the great dark satires like ""Dr. Strangelove"" or ""Network"", it's still amusing and witty,",1373068800,,422,4.767123287671233
8276172,5,B001A5C4CG,"A decade later of the fabulous success of Mr. Marshall, Berlanga decided to make his glorious masterpiece. A demolishing black satire about the daughter of the executioner and a modest burier.

The main executioner is an aged man who really thinks to get off his job which is to be the final agent who works out as the official executioner of the state. But there's just a minor problem, he has to find someone who occupies his place and he realizes the appropriate candidate is a humble gravedigger. On one hand, he will marry with his non so pleasant daughter, and on the other he will be able to live his last days thanks to a juicy pension warranted by his years of service.

Berlanga plays hard with a very dark humor that rides between the caustic irreverence and the untamed surrealism. Every single detail is supported on a very smart script that works out at unthinkable levels.

This is without question, the most irreverent dark comedy of the sixties and due its peculiar nature, became a cult movie, since its first release in 1963.

Since I watched it in Caracas 1976, I loved it and I could get a DVD from Spain, thanks to the good will of a beloved friend in 2003.

Acquire at soon as you can this unique and original satire.",1250640000,5,1240,4.493333333333333
