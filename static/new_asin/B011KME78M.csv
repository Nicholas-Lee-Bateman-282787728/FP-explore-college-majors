7333981,4,B011KME78M,"A fairly worthy continuance of the Tremors story, this time set in Africa, with differently evolving grabboids and assblasters.  Without Michael Gross, it wouldn't be worth buying.  Micheal Gross is the custodian of the Burt character.  I do wonder if this will be the end of the series.",1512691200,,287,4.9375

7333984,5,B011KME78M,"For an avid fan of the series I actually enjoyed this movie. After the second movie, they all kind of got a little goofy for me. I mean the series itself is goofy with the plot of the movie. But this is the first Tremors movie that actually shows a little of horror in terms of being more scary then movies in the past. These have always been move horror/comedy movies. This movie does have a few nod backs to the older movies, and they still deliver some funny one liners. But this is a great movie in my opinion. It adds more horror the movies in the past.",1509580800,,558,4.128440366972477
7333985,5,B011KME78M,"The Tremors movies are the most fun you can have with something that is stupid but smart at the same time, rips off and makes fun of ""mainstream"" movies like Jurassic Park, Jaws, and several others, works within an obviously very low special effects budget, but the monsters still WORK, and Michael Gross is hilarious. Burt Gummer is my hero.

Jamie Kennedy fits right in with the ""Tremors Franchise"" and I can't wait for the next one (number 6) to come out next year. This is not HIGH ART, but it's certainly entertaining, funny as heck, and classic monster movie stuff.",1508716800,,571,4.653465346534653

7333991,3,B011KME78M,"Check it out. It's Tremors..... sadly it's without the original actors, 'cept one. At least ""he"" stayed behind to continue to amuse us. And I thank him grandly. The movie would be a complete dive if not for him! He is the main actor these days it seems for Tremors. Sad but true.  If you decide you are a die hard fan of Tremors, it may be alright.",1500595200,,348,4.117647058823529

Bert's past catches up with him as he pursues a new African version of the beasties.
I found it to be a bit to comedic for me, but there were several gory scenes to remind you its a monster movie.

7334008,4,B011KME78M,"We have all the Tremors movies.  We figured they'd run the franchise dry.  Apparently not.  We bought mostly to satisfy our curiosity.  Turned out it wasn't too bad.  If it wasn't for Michael Gross, this franchise would've fallen flat on it's face with the first movie.  He just plays his role so good.  I would recommend it.",1487116800,,325,4.5964912280701755
7334009,4,B011KME78M,"Put this on in the background on a Sunday afternoon and you will not be disappointed. The first and fourth films were the best, this was distinctly a made-for-Syfy television event.  It had something to do with ass-blasters protecting Graboids bloodlines? And it was in Africa for some reason? And somehow in every step of this series the Graoids et al. get inexplicably more diverse and powerful?

The father from Family Ties teams up with Malibu's Most Wanted and then they kill some weird animals whose evolutionary purpose is entirely unclear. Sure, why not?

The nonsense piles up, but just let it wash over you - just ignore the lion pissing-on-face scene! (Yes, that was really a thing)  Ignore how it took the pilot all of two minutes to hook up pilfered rocket pods to his helicopter! Ignore the pathetic characterization, ridiculous scenarios, unlikely events compiling upon one another. It was harmless, and you can go happily along for the ride as there are few consequences you are compelled to care about.",1485820800,,1019,4.906976744186046

I loved the first two films in this venerable monster franchise, but the last two were awful.  I haven't checked out the TV show, but I am happy to report that the Tremors series has made a minor comeback with its fifth installment.  It still comes nowhere close to the originals, but it easily comes in third with fun performances from Gross and Kennedy and a decent script that keeps things moving along.",1480723200,,514,4.688888888888889

The scenes in the desert with the lion are absolutely gut busting and true to the character. All the supporting characters keep this in the realm of the first. As someone else has commented, it could have been a lot worse. It wasn't. The end keeps the possibility of another series open. I hope it happens.",1474761600,,444,4.493827160493828

It brought back the dread quite nicely while still keeping some of the humor, and Burt Gummer has never been more awesome, the greatest survivalist of them all.

Directed by Don Michael Paul. Written by William Truesmith, M.A. Deuce and John Whelpley.

Returning: Michael Gross as ""Burt Gummer"".

The movie begins with Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) giving you a filmed refresher course of the different types of graboids that have evolved.
Then we see Johan Dreyer (Brandon Auret) and Basson (Lawrence Joffe) in South Africa hunting for wildlife to photograph. Dreyer hears rumbling from the ground. Basson wants to take a piss and trips over some rocks and into a deep open hole. He is trapped in a caveran and something is down there with him. Dreyer gets a rope to pull him up, but as he pulls as hard as he can, a graboid eats Basson right on the rope. Dreyer is pulled along, but is not hurt on the surface.
  While Burt continues to film in the Mojave Desert of Nevada with his cameraman, Riley (Zak Hendrikz), a man on a motorcycle comes upon Burt. He is Travis B. Welker (Jamie Kennedy) and he is there to replace Riley, unbeknownst to Burt. Riley leaves immediately to go to his next union job, The Housewives of Las Vegas. As Travis tries to get to Burt's more friendly side, Erich van Wyk (Daniel Janks) arrives in his van also finding Burt on location. He has a job for Burt. A flying graboid has been spotted in Gauteng. South Africa.

7334101,1,B011KME78M,"Not only are the special effects horrendous, but all of the charm of the original series is completely gone. This movie was filmed on a bare-bones budget and it shows. Bad CGI, horrendous cinematography, unlikable characters that you hope catch the Jigger, very limited weapons, and a giant insult to fans of the series. The Graboid is especially bad. Even 3 and 4 gave us something new and interesting with the Graboid's life cycle, but 5 only offers cheap one-ride tricks that both make no sense and make the monster seem weaker and smaller. If you wanted to see a movie where Burt Gummer turns into Bear Grylls, which includes stripping near-naked and covering himself in his own piss as insect repellent, then this is a movie for you. People that liked the rest of the series should stay away.

I'd rather drink piss than acknowledge that this movie exists. You know why? Because drinking piss can be washed out if you brush your teeth and take enough mints, and it doesn't completely ruin a classic, memorable character. Tremors 5 can NOT be washed out, because this is the end of the Tremors franchise. Tremors dies with a whisper, and no amount of washing can make that go away.",1463184000,2,1185,4.669856459330144
7334102,4,B011KME78M,"They came up with another place for the Graboids and Assblasters to rain down death and destruction.

The creatures are slightly different, whether for evolution for branches in the gene lines.  But that is good and OK for the storyline.

I have to say though that I liked number 4 the most of all the movies due to its slant on the story being from the old west timeline as the beginning, but this one is OK too.  It is becoming a cult movie line, so I have to watch and buy each one as they come.

A new character has been brought into the story and it gives all sorts of options to the writers.  The character was made out to be the long lost son of Burt and that gives the writers of the next movie the ability to branch out with a new character and have Burt get a rest or whatever.  But I don't like his acting as the new character on the block.  So it has a negative aspect.

We will see now.  Keep it coming.",1463011200,,916,4.011049723756906

This is, non-the less, a good Sci-Fi flick. Effects are good and there is no excessive gore other than the occasional rain of exploded graboids.",1461369600,,475,4.804878048780488

7334124,4,B011KME78M,"I will preface this review by saying that I have seen all of the previous Tremor movies (several times) and all episodes of the short-lived Tremors TV show. Obviously, when I first saw that Tremors 5 was out, I had to have it.

Assuming that you haven't watched all of the above, the original Tremors movie had a rather large budget and cast that included Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Reba McEntire and Michael Gross. The story centers around the town of Perfection, Nevada and its small population who come under attack from giant, underground worms called ""Graboids"". The subsequent movies and TV series seem to have been shot on a considerably lower budget with almost the entire cast either disappearing or being killed off in the process. The lone survivor of the franchise is survivalist Burt Gummer (played by Michael Gross) and the Graboids themselves.

Tremors 5 seems to be a step up in the budget and production departments, with a much larger cast and much of the movie having actually been shot on location in South Africa. As I understand it, the original script had the scenery switched to Australia, but Universal made a LOT of changes and subsequently decided not to re-hire the original writers or production company that had made the previous 4 films along with the TV series. Usually, this would be a recipe for disaster, but Universal actually did a good job and this came across as one of the more interesting and entertaining of the entire franchise.

While the cast has expanded quite a bit, the entire movie really revolves around Burt Gummer, so Michael Gross really needed to come through in order to make this film work. Fortunately, Gross brought his usual A-Game and his performance pretty much outshone everyone else in the movie. When making ""monster movies"" you really have to ride a fine line between serious and ""campy"", which both the writers and Gross seem to have nailed in what may be the final chapter in the franchise. I'm not giving any spoilers away here, but Michael Gross is no spring chicken and unless this movie makes a lot more than the previous installments I'm not sure that Universal will be willing to foot the bill for Tremors 6.

That aside, if you are a fan of slightly campy sci-fi movies, you will definitely enjoy this, especially if you have seen the previous 4 movies. Even if you haven't, the plot stays pretty simple, so you won't feel left out if this is your first look at the Tremors franchise. The only reason that I am marking this down to 4 stars is due to the lousy CGI work they used, which was produced in Romania. Fortunately, there isn't that much of it that they used. I would have much rather seen the low-tech special effects that the franchise used in the early installments than the junk that passes as CGI these days. This is really the only part of the film that Universal truly screwed-up, but if you blink at the right time you will miss these appearances entirely.

P.S. For those of you die hard Tremors fans, the rumors are true. The Shriekers do not appear at all in this movie. Only the Graboids and the Ass Blasters. The reasoning for this may be something having to do with the evolutionary cycle of the African Graboids. The reasoning seems pretty speculative within the dialogue of the film. It could be that the CGI was just so horrible that the footage never made it off the cutting room floor though. Only the producers know for sure.",1459641600,,3424,4.643564356435643

7334136,2,B011KME78M,"I'm a fan of the Tremors films, I even liked Back to Perfection regardless of the horrible CGI work and if they had used practical effects more in that film, I think it would have been better received. Bloodlines uses a lot of CGI, but it is much better this time around. Unfortunately they lost the charm associated with these films somewhere, it just doesn't feel like a Tremors sequel. The effects are well done, but the new reimagined monsters are uninspired and borrow elements of Predator, Blade and too many other creatures in other films. I think what worked in the other Tremors films is that the creatures were more original, but that being said, it is interesting how these creatures evolve with each film. Technical this is a well made film, but for me it just wasn't very fun, maybe after repeat viewings I'll warm up to it, I own all of the movies including this one so I will watch it again the next time I'm in the mood for a complete Tremors franchise fix. I have heard rumors of a 6th film coming with Bacon returning, If this is true I can only hope that they will return to the tone that made the Tremors films so enjoyable.

It's not a total lose, but if part 3 had CGI that was this convincing, then that film would be way better than this one. As it is, it's worth a look for fans, but keep your expectations very low. I'd give it 2 stars, too bad because it certainly could have been one of the better sequels.",1458518400,,1434,4.311111111111111

7334162,5,B011KME78M,"Just finished watching ""Tremors 5 - Bloodlines"" released by Universal.
Mom, Dad, Selma, and I watched the first ""Tremors"" movie back at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina on the silver screen when it was first released a couple of decades ago - that's how old and how still popular the Tremors series is and how strong the cult following behind it is.
Actor Michael Gross continues to be spot on in his performance as Survivalist Burt Gummer, who is now filming his own reality television show in an attempt to rebuild ""The Gummer"" brand.
Only fate intervenes in the form of two arrivals on the scene.  The first is free wheeling motorcyclist and cameraman Travis Welker who presents himself as a social media specialist who has been hired by the network to help Gummer come a little way back onto the Grid; and the other arrival on the scene is a South African wildlife official who needs Gummer's help in capturing the deadly Assblaster carnivore which is on a killing rampage in the African country.
At first Gummer is skeptical - the Graboid population is confined to North America.  But sure enough, he's convinced and with Wekler in tow, he's off to kill monsters in South Africa.
Only all is not what it seems and neither is Welker - who - SPOILER ALERT - has a rather unexpected tie to Gummer.
A great and fun entry into the Tremors series.
Strongly Recommended!

Wow...what a waste of time and money. Very disappointing to see the series stoop this low. The redesigns are terrible...everything you like about the graboid life cycle is gutted and vomited into the new designs. The GRABOIDS can now fly vertically out of the ground and into the air in this one...the tentacles can detach...the characters are annoying/forgettable. One of the producers must have a pee fetish because there is a lot of pee ""humor"". This movie was such a let down.

7334183,5,B011KME78M,"The original ""Tremors"" was destined to be a success with its relatively low budget & the talent of Fred Ward & Kevin Bacon ( At his Peak ) it was a win, win scenario for the studio!!!  Its no surprise with the profits it pulled in that there would be a sequel.  But a Franchise???  Why not?  The real surprise is it is a really good franchise!!!  This is what happens when you have clever writers working for you, & a hungry for more fan base doesn't hurt a bit!  So decades later a ""Tremors 5""???  Again...  Why Not???  Take the ultimate survivor & throw him in Africa... where everything is bigger...add in some fun loving fans ready for more fun & you got yourselves yet another hit movie!  ""Tremors"" was always meant to be a tongue in cheek nod to the old 50's 60's era giant monster movies & never took itself to seriously & the fans know it.  This is escapist fantasy at its best & the success of the Tremors Franchise is simple...  give the fans what they want Action, Adventure & Comedy.  And that is what they have delivered from the start.  Tremors 5:  Bloodlines  was not produced with a Academy Award in mind, just giving the fans what they wanted more outrageous monster's & one tenacious hardcore bad ass named Burt Gummer!!!  Of course Michael Gross A.K.A. (Burt Gummer) would deny all that and just say ""I'm just a survivalist!""  The Fans know better, good old Burt has survived being consumed by a ""Graboid"", air assaults from "" Assblasters "" & even a divorce... there's nothing Burt can't get through!!!  I wouldn't be surprised if those creepy creatures from before the cretaceous don't show up in Russia next !!!  Hey I'd buy it after all the Mongolian death worm has to be based on something!!!  Lots of gooey action and adventure left in them there Worms.  And a lot of fans young & old that are up for some wild fun!!!",1453852800,,1841,4.416666666666667

I am widely known for being a terrible critic of movies. That being said, this movie was awesome. Why didn't it get 5 stars then, you ask? I'm giving it a star ranking as compared to the other films in the series, with 1 and 2 obviously at 5 stars, and the other three a step lower at 4 stars. I'd actually go with 10/10 for #1, 9/10 for #2, 8/10 for #3 and #5, and 7/10 for #4. If you've come here looking for a scholarly critique of a straight to video 5th film in a horror/comedy series, then you need to reevaluate things. It's a movie about giant, underground worms that eat people. It is the 5th such film in the series. It is not going to be up for any Oscars.

I'd heard rumors that it was being shot in South America, and then Australia, but it looks like South Africa won this time around.  Don't know why they never went with a theatrical release but I suppose there's more money to be made in the direct to DVD market.

7334216,4,B011KME78M,"Didn't even know there was a new ""Tremors"" movie until I saw this advertised on netflix. So, I ordered it...

I missed the badinage between Val and Earl from the first film, and in the second film, Earl and Christopher Garlin. When Bert became the focal point, a lot of that humor was lost but enough remained, courtesy of the survivalist's seriousness contrasted against whomever was the sidekick that week. In this one, Bert seems to have any glint of humor at all. He's dead-serious until the very, very end.

This time around, Graboids have been discovered in South Africa, both in fossil and living forms. The former form is identified by archologists who quickly become prey. Pity, it would've been nice to have kept them around for some batting back and forth with Bert. In this film, it seems all the interesting characters are little used or get disposed of fast.

The monsters in this one have evolved and are different and more deadly than their US cousins. WIth the unwanted assistance of a cinematographer who has a secret of his own to share with Bert, our hero, as the only expert on Graboids, goes to the Dark Continent to help out and to make a documentary of the trip. The usual deaths and hunt ensue.

The story really has nothing new and except for a couple of surprises having nothing to do with the creatures, is pretty much as usual. Actually filmed on location in South Africa, there's no love interest for the sidekick, and not much viewing of the bodies though there is a great deal of blood and monster bits sprayed around.

I'd tag this as ""relatively entertaining"" but nowhere close to the original. The little promotional video for Bert inserted in the end-credits is more intriguing than most of the movie. Perhaps the next one, if it happens, will be that documentary.

7334251,2,B011KME78M,"This one unfortunately fell flat for me, even a devoted Tremmie for many years now.  Obviously none will compare to the original, but Bloodlines is the weakest of the entire movies series, including Back to Perfection (Tremors 4), which is saying something, considering Michael Gross played his character's own grandfather, among other things.  The special effects were low budget CGI, fitting for a SyFy Original Movie but not Tremors, where puppeteering and practical effects have always been the best.  Limited Graboid action.  Yet another reincarnation of the Graboid life cycles and appearance.  Plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon- no one had heard of Graboids before the first movie, yet South African tribes have centuries old ritualistic dances to prevent Graboid/Shrieker/Assblaster attacks?  Really?  ""Oh sure Earl- everybody knows about 'em... we just didn't tell you!""

In their attempts to pay homage and drop lines for long-time fans, classic scenes and lines were copied, sometimes word-for-word, which instead of coming off as a fun ""I see what you did there!"" it just looks lazy and ill fitting.

Michael Gross didn't seem to enjoy himself nearly as much as in the other movies, or series (yes, I've seen them all, several times).  The ""reveal"" with his character at the end was cliche, pointless, and reasonable foreseeable if you gave it half a thought (which I didn't simply because this is Tremors, not a lifetime movie).  I cringed.  Hard.

It's worth a Redbox if you're a die-hard fan like myself, or just into bad sci-fi movies, also like myself.

Unfortunately this particular sequel isn't nearly as good as previous Tremors movies.  And, sadly, Burt (Michael Gross) seems to have lost both his enthusiasm and crust, and just seems tired (and much thinner). There also wasn't nearly as much action as in previous Tremors... it felt more like they were trying to make a buddy movie, except the buddy is so unlikable that you keep hoping he'll get eaten.  Still, if your a die-hard Tremors fan like me, you may still want to see what definitely feels like a wrap-up to the series.

I really wanted to love this as much as the previous movies and hated to give it 3 stars; but it felt really tired, was far from action packed, and sadly just wasn't up to the Tremors franchise.",1448323200,,892,4.527950310559007

7334261,5,B011KME78M,"Unlike many of the comments about this movie that were written before this movie was even released, I am writing mine after having watched it.

In my opinion, this is a fine addition to the Tremors series.
I actually feel it's more of a 4.5 Stars.
The CGI is such that I did not even realize it was CGI. I thought it was all puppets.
It turns out that they used both puppets and CGI. And they did quite a good job doing so (contrary to what the naysayers who posted before this movie was released say). Most of the scenes with the CGI were seamless and did not appear to be computer graphics.

The characters, overall, are pretty interesting. Including the human villains

My only complaint about this film is that it is kind of Jaime Kennedy heavy.
I wondered--while waiting for it to arrive--why his name got top billing instead of Michael Gross. Burt Gummer is the coolest character I have seen in movies for a long time and I really wanted more of him.
Although the percentage is kind of close--about 52% Jamie Kennedy to 48% Michael Gross--I would have liked more Burt.
Some of Jamie's character was saying or doing things that sometimes made me wonder 'Why?'.

However, do NOT let that stop you from getting this movie and adding it to your Tremors library. It is a very fine addition to the franchise. I have loved them all. The ""strong"" and the ""weak"" (I do not think any of them are truly ""weak"". They are all quite good).

I am very happy to have this added to my collection.

7334276,3,B011KME78M,"You decide: as a Tremors/Graboid fan, it's great to see the franchise still alive and kicking with a pretty good, well made monster flick; however, it did lack some of the fun and humor and endearing characters that made the series a cult classic.

Burt(Michael Gross- who's got his cantankerous, survivalist role down to the tee- heads off to beautiful, South Africa to check out monster sightings/killings.  His weapons don't clear customs fast enough so he's under serviced, and ""has to think ousidet of the box"", and his ""newbie"" partner guy is more interested in dancing with the natives than taking on the serious business at hand.

There are plenty of outdoor shots, creative action, CGI special effects, a few Tremor approved twists, and plenty of gory get munched up scenes that should satisfy the horror fans of the series.

Now, the cons, no Perfection here.  My wife and I have watched these flicks from the start, and we both thought this one lacked the fun.  Even though there are one liners and silly situations, especially Burt and the qualities of urine, the focus was more on the horror, and the humor more crass.  The secondary characters didn't capture my interest and Burt's new partner lacked likability.  We always enjoyed the character interactions more than the monster show.

Unfortunately, he is saddled with a horrible plot ploy (Jamie Kennedy).  Of all the sidekicks Burt has been paired with over the years, this one is the worst.  Kennedys brand of humor is jarring.

First off, I have always liked the main characters in the Tremors movies, but Tremors 5 introduced a new main character that I cannot stand. He was so annoying that I thought they made him that way on purpose because he was going to be eaten by a Graboid. But alas he was not eaten and they made him a huge part of the movie. The whole cage scene was both annoying and stupid. Burt is always prepared, but not in this movie.
Of course there are parts of movies that are not realistic, but there is a certain point in which they cross the line.  The new ""symbiotic components"" on the Graboids are just too far out there. The redesign of the ***blasters is not an improvement.  It looked more like a cross between ""Jeffery"" from Men in Black and an actual ***blaster.  Tremors 5 missed the mark.

Having been an avid watcher of the series, I was thrilled when I heard there was another tremors, I mean come on, another episode of Burt and his big guns? Throw in some great side characters, a lot of witty remarks and all in all you have a great movie.

Sadly this movie was not like the ones before.

1: Characters

Its hard to get into a story when your characters are bland, or they are just ghost of characters past, you could easily tell who was going to die, and who was going to live, within the first few seconds of meeting a said character, not to mention they were all unoriginal and boring to me. Nothing I could relate to, and no real tension between potential love interest, or even just that mother/daughter relationship. And the money grubbing bad guy, *gasp* who didn't see that coming. There was just no relationship with the characters for me no ""Ah, someone just died!"" I felt disinterested.

2: Plot
Rushed and generic, there was really no back story on why these grabiods were different than the ones in America and Mexico, just that they were mutated and bigger for some reason. It never really drew me in and the people and I that I  was watching with became more interested in our belly buttons than the movie for lack of any decent writing.

3: Fear Factor
It seems movie directors have confused jump scares and gore for true fear. The first movies had me terrified Graboids where going to get us all, this one had me predicting what was going to happen and giving a look of disgust when they substituted tension with blood., and I walked away feeling like I needed my time back.

All in all I felt the humor, plot, characters, story writing and the fact that Burt had none of his guns, just made the movie not worth it, I kinda want my money back and my time...",1446508800,5,1814,4.413173652694611

His videographer quits, as his replacement arrives on the scene via a dirt bike. The newby is quick on the draw,especially with the verbal comebacks. Just as they are discussing Gummer's new ""branding"",a bloke shows up from South Africa,apparently from a governmental agency there. It seems there have been new deaths reported from the same creatures that stalked the Nevada desert years before. At first skeptical, Gummer eventually agrees to go and also let the newby tag along with his camera, as they head to a game reserve in Africa.
Upon arrival the newb becomes fast friends with the female attendant there,while Burt gets right to work. It doesn't take long, as an ass-blaster arrives on the scene,killing one of the reserve employees. Burt is flummoxed by the South African government's confiscation of his weaponry. What he is given are relative pea shooters to what he is used to carrying. But he makes due and he and the G-man,go a-hunting. They soon find and have a stand off with an ass-blaster. They kill it but find something inside-an egg. At that moment the G-man turns his weapon on Burt and absconds with the egg,after locking him in a cage they brought to capture one of the creatures. It seems he was a poacher,not a G-man. Burt did NOT see that one coming. Burt sits in the cage going from raging mad to delerious. After almost a day in it, the newb finally comes to the rescue. Getting a graboid reading on his sensor at that exact moment,the newb drags Burt in the cage along behind the truck he came in. The chain breaks and Burt goes tumbling out of control. The truck also has broken a fuel line and is out of gas. The two are forced to route march it back to the reserve. Along the way they run into the poacher who is running,bloodied,from a graboid,with the egg in a metal box. A tentacle comes out and grabs the box,while soon after a graboid eats the man whole and travels to a nearby cave. They have now discovered three new things:1)the graboids nesting grounds, 2)the tentacles can now detach from the graboid body and 3) the graboids here are leaner and longer than their North American counterparts.
While the newb and Burt stand on rocks,Burt radios for a local pilot to come and rescue them. He shows up in a helicopter but both he and a helper get swallowed up by a graboid. Burt and the newb manage to get into the chopper which bristles with fire power. They send multiple rockets into the cave and blow it up. Just then the helicopter pilot resurfaces explaining that the graboid didn't like him shooting his stomach,and spit him out. The three head back to the reserve ,where they have also been under attack by graboids and have fled to a nearby village. Finding the reserve  empty when they arrive, they too head for the village. Upon arrival they see that most of the villagers are up on roofs and fences. The reserve attendants daughter has inadvertently been carrying a graboid egg around with her and she is now stranded in the village circle,surrounded by two self propelled tentacles. Burt and the newb devise a plan:the newb will distract the graboid while the villagers set a trap to coincide with an electrical storm which hits daily around that time. They put out every metallic object they can find,and when the time is right,the graboid is led back to the village by the newb who sweeps up the girl,while the egg is put on top of the metal,and the graboid is killed as the lightning strikes.
While all this plot has been played out, sly references by the newb have been thrown out to Burt regarding a certain gun show he attended in the 70s in Florida,the same state the newb is from. Turns out Burt had a one night stand with his mother and the newb was produced!
The film ends in the credits as they are making a new vid about ""The Survivalists"".The vid explains this new father and son team will tackle any nightmare problem(monsters,things that go bump in the night,etc)that one may encounter.
Do I sense a new spin off franchise here? If done right,it could work well. However,to the film at hand. Michael Gross is fully back in character as the paranoic but lovable Burt Gummer. The film is really his,and the rest revolves around his exploits throughout. However ,he is ably assisted by the entire cast,especially his new found son,the newb,aka Jamie Kennedy. Kennedy's character has a wise cracking,more modern sense of comportment,as opposed to Burt who is definitely old school. The news of his new found son doesn't bring him down as much as I thought it might. But just don't call him""pops"".
The film moves along at a great pace and is well edited. We learn a lot about this new graboid menace now half way around the world in South Africa. It isn't just a rehash of the older tremors films,which is refreshing.
Technically the film is clear and crisp in its original w/s a/r of 1:78:1. There is commentary,a featurette,deleted scenes and outtakes.
All in all a very nice and new addition to the Tremors franchise. Mr. Gross is bang on and back in perfect character as Burt Gummer. Highly recommended. 4-4- 1/2 stars.",1446163200,,5417,4.6961093585699265

7334337,3,B011KME78M,"The fifth movie in the ""Tremors"" series, like its predecessors, shows further mutations and variations on its signature monsters. Michael Gross entertains in his return as series mainstay Burt Gummer, this time paired up with Jamie Kennedy, his long-lost son, as they fight the Graboids and Ass Blasters in South Africa. The change in location offers new secondary characters, all of whom are more interesting than Kennedy and don't get the screen time they deserve. Pearl Thusi, portraying a veterinarian who runs a wildlife preserve, and Rea Rangaka, one of the preserve's rangers, are both far more interesting than Kennedy.
In a nod to other films, one scene portrays several of the South African characters face down Ass Blasters in a high-tech kitchen in a manner reminiscent of the original ""Jurassic Park"". Later, Kennedy, in a cave full of graboid eggs, imitates one of Bruce Willis' sarcastic monologues from the original ""Die Hard"".
Overall, ""Tremors 5"" lacks the creativity of the earlier films and even the television series. The transition from blended animatronic and CGI monsters to CGI-only makes this feel like any other direct-to-video creature feature. Perhaps the greatest weakness is the filmmakers' choice to focus so much on Kennedy. The movie would have been better if Gross's character had teamed up with Thusi's, whose character has mysterious access to automatic weaponry and uses a bow and fire arrow to great effect. Fans of the series will find certain parts enjoyable, but, unlike the earlier films, it's not likely to bring in new fans on its own.",1445817600,,1580,5.127906976744186

Is it silly? Definitely. But that's why you're here in the first place, isn't it?

Michael Gross returns in all of his glory as Burt Gummer, and proves once again that he really is the only one who can. The discovery of Ass Blasters in South Africa has him crossing the globe to go and take care of the problem, and we learn a bit more about the Tremors lore along the way. For example, some of the characters encounter ancient cave paintings depicting humans being attacked by graboids, and there is a Zulu word for ""Ass Blaster"", so we've apparently been dealing with these baddies for a long time (though that does raise the question of how nobody noticed that fact until now). This latest installment in the franchise also features a Jurassic Park homage, a sexy female hero, and possibly Burt's coolest getup yet (http://www.imfdb.org/images/thumb/5/5e/Tremors5burt303bsa.jpg/500px-Tremors5burt303bsa.jpg - though you gotta see it in action to really appreciate it).

7334358,2,B011KME78M,"Like many Tremors fans, I was very excited when I found out about this film and I bought the DVD as soon as it came out.  I loved Tremors 1-3, but I wish I had saved my money and rented this installment instead.  Tremors 5: Bloodlines is better than Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (which I hated), but worse than the first three Tremors movies (Tremors, Aftershocks, and Back to Perfection).

There were so many things I disliked about this movie.  The warmth and humor that made the first three films so enjoyable and fun to watch is missing in this installment of the series.  Other than Burt (played by Michael Gross), I didn't care for any of the characters (& that includes his son played by Jamie Kennedy), with the exception of Burt and one old guy, the characters lacked personality.  Much of the humor is not funny; the repeated urination scenes and the constant jabs at Burt's age.  There is a scene I especially disliked where Burt goes temporarily insane/crazy while trapped in a lion cage, the scene was not needed, it was not funny, it was not in keeping with Burt's character, and it went on way too long.  The whole setup for the film didn't work (I won't spoil it, but it would have been better if the only villains in the film had been the monsters).  Moving the film location to Africa didn't do anything to make the film better, the series works best when it's in the US Southwest.  As a whole, I didn't find the monsters enjoyable or interesting.  The CGI used for the Graboids was not good, the old-style Graboids were visually better and what's more they actually had personalities (especially in the first film).  Most of the film's monster action involved the A-blasters which I've never liked.

So was there anything I did like?  Only a few things.  As always, I liked Burt, he is fun to watch, and it's nice that Burt has a son who wants to follow in his footsteps and work with him (even if I didn't find the son appealing or likable).  Although the monsters were uninteresting due to lack of personality, bad CGI, and the emphasis on the A-blasters, the idea of latest evolution of Graboids as smaller and faster is good.

Could there be another installment in this film franchise?  Maybe, but sadly I think the franchise has run its course.",1445126400,4,2268,4.530712530712531

Personally I loved this movie and I hope it continues on with his ""son"". I was surprised to see the changes to the Ass Blasters but personally I am OK with it since that is where the monster industry is heading with the overly dramatic monsters that look more like wood chippers........or pencil sharpeners depending on how you look at it.
I was glad to see they stuck with the original reveal plot of hiding the monsters during the first half of the movie while not lacking in the attacks leading up to the big dramatic reveal.
The lack of Shriekers was not ignored thanks to Gummer yelling it during one of the final attacks, the ""Where the hell are the Shriekers?"" was much needed at that point. They never did explain the lack of Shriekers but then again they did say this Sub Species was more efficient then the Western Hemisphere cousins.

It starts great, with Burt being Burt, and then we flash to Africa and a guy taking a dump. Grunts and moans, are included.
He then pees himself (in graphic detail) while hanging from a rope and about to be eaten.
Next bathroom scene (there are more than you want details on) Burt in the cage dumping urine on himself as insect repellant.
Next, he urinates again and drinks it.
Then he is urinated on by the lion who found the cage.
At that point, I puked and turned the film off.  (Using the word 'film' generously.) Who thinks up this crap?
There were other issues-such as the creepy, neurotic new camera guy who think he's a motorcycle stuntman, terrible dialogue, and cheesy makeup on the monsters.
The acting sucked, the action sucked, and I was already 57% through it and still had no idea what the plotline was. The blurb mentioned a fifth, new monster, but I couldn't take anymore peeing or defecating to get to it.
On the whole, it is an hour I will never get back, disgusting images that will never leave my brain, and a final lid on the box that used to be an interesting sci-fi series. Good luck getting ANYONE to buy a part 6.

I actually don't hate the fourth one, I think it's an okay B-movie, but this one made me sad. I had been looking forward to this movie for some time, and was surprised to see it available to watch on Netflix. Burt Gummer returns and teams up with Jamie Kennedy. Kennedy's character in this ranged from intolerable (he reminded me of Melvin) to almost bearable. Burt was less energetic then in all of the previous films and the mini series, and he seemed to be treated as ""too old"" throughout the film, (being the butt of age jokes throughout) which made me very sad. The creatures from the previous films and the series are not in this, and while I could complain about the CGI, it wasn't that bad, it just wasn't the same as the practical effects from the past. The good? There were a couple of scenes where the action was good, there was plenty of people getting covered in orange goo, and.. that's it. It's not set in Perfection, it doesn't have the classic grabiods, or any of the other characters from before, other then Burt Gummer who seems sad and quiet, and Jamie Kennedy is irritating. All of that and I still would have given it 3 stars for nostalgia. Until one scene.

7334374,3,B011KME78M,"[Spoilers maybe, but not really] Perhaps its because I came in expecting much much worse, I was actually pleasantly surprised by this one. This film had a lot of red flags. Redesigned monsters, new locale, being the 5th movie in a series that has stayed alive on straight to video sequels for way too long, and Jamie Kennedy. However, it wasn't that bad. Not great, but had a lot of great moments that I didn't expect. Jamie Kennedy wasn't even all that unbearable. In fact I'd take him over Fred Ward's sidekick in Tremors 2 any day. The FX were much better than I expected, especially with atrociously named A** Blasters. Most of their time on screen was pretty impressive and downright creepy.

On that note, that may be my biggest complaint, hearing that name waaaay too much in one movie. Even after they give them a different name from the indigenous people, everyone still stuck with A** Blasters till the end, Ugh. Theres also quite an abundance of them in this movie, making up about 90% of the monster interactions. The worms pretty much make a cameo by the end of the movie but really aren't the focal point till then. Most of the other effects were decent, only really falling apart when it came to the worms busting in and out of the ground constantly, which is ironic considering that's part of what made the first movie great. Having the Jaws effect of never seeing the monster is totally lost in this one when they're basically now swimming LIKE sharks half in and out of the dirt. And it's the worst CGI in the movie, but only marginally.

The biggest fault of this movie is the redesign of the creatures though. They have a good explanation as to why (they're an entirely different species) but they're SOOOOOO vastly different with almost no similarities to the originals, that you almost forget you're watching a tremors movie at all. That's what I think lead to so many bad reviews as it sorta spits in the face of fans who don't see any throwback to the original design we all grew up with. Tho to be fair they did finally explain the confusing life cycle of the constantly metamorphosised creatures. (Tho I didn't watch the series, so maybe I'm late to that party.)

But as a B-Movie monster flick, it still holds up. The acting was shockingly decent with some surprisingly good lines and deliveries from the background cast. The writing...well, kinda sucks, but I've definitely seen worse, with characers making decisions that don't make any sense, like in several occasions where they're hiding on a rock from a graboid, but then keep constantly strolling off of it for apparently no reason and no look of concern or urgency.

If anything, the worst parts were with Burt as they tried to put him through comedicly tough situations, but instead turn them into way-too-long montages of him doing increasingly more embarrassingly stupid things. I hope he got paid handsomely for the cage scene alone (you'll get it when you see it).

In the end I walked away not feeling disappointed or angry that I had wasted my time watching it. It didn't do me much fan service but it did leave me more entertained than I expected. It actually made me want to see another one, instead of me wanting the series to die like 3 and 4 did. As long as the next one isn't tremors in space, or in ""Da Hood"", I may still give them another chance. And the ending sets up that there may be a new character to take Burt's place once he gets too old to keep making them, so I assume they have more in queue.",1444867200,,3503,4.545166402535657

While this was a good movie, it wasn't that funny and it really wasn't that good. The movie was kind of spoiled by the overuse of CGIthe shriekers, ass blasters and graboids were entirely new creatures that didn't even act or look much like the ones in the other movies. They looked like they were created for a real horror flick and didn't fit the campy attitude of the Tremors series. They were way over done. CGI was a waste of money and was detrimental to the whole film.

This film was a remake of the first 4 movies. (Why was there a buried concrete wall in the middle of the yard at the lodge? Gummer had to be cut out of the graboid with a chainsaw, but the graboid spit the pilot out?) Not only did they try to bring back the essence of the original cast of characters and completely failed, but you can see how they did the same scenes as in the original movies; just set in Africa. That and scenes stolen wholesale straight of other moviesJurassic Park [""fully fund your videos for the next 3 years"" ""full fund your dig for the"" the scene with the Shrieker in was a turn by turn copy of the scene of the raptors in the kitchen; except for the toe tapping part, in which the toe shown tapping looks nothing like the toe of any of the monsters in movie. Hammond had a jet waiting for them in Chouteau and this guy has a jet waiting for Gummer, et al.] and Die Hard [""Come to LA, we'll have some laughs..."" ""Come to Africa, we'll have some laughs...""] Van Wyk calls it ""South African Wildlife Ministry"" while Burt and Travis call it the ""South African Wildlife Federation.""

The there was the non-sequitors: Why was the girl zapping the ground for worms in the first place? Is she going fishing? I didn't see any bodies of water around. (I know it was a lead on into what follows.) Why did it take the graboid so long to eat the paleontologists when the others were gone in seconds? If all humans took that much time to eat, graboids would be easy to kill. There were human bones in the cave: 1] graboids ate where they found food, they didn't drag it back to the cave and 2] nobody could ever find any scat/spoor from a graboid (""You'd think after they ate all those sheep, they'd have to take a dump somewhere) So how did the bones get there? And why were there ONLY human bones? Didn't they eat the other animals? (Graboids/Shriekers/ass blasters ignored the whole herd of cattle by their cave, but came after the humans?) White phosphorus grenades do not explode as shown, they explode and shoot WP all over and when it hits tissue, it burns; it's an anti-personnel weapon, not a demolition charge.

At around 57:00 left in the film, they show the characters in Van Wyk's implausibly lime green Toyota Land Cruiser. Johan is turning the steering wheel, they are bouncing up and down like they're driving. Yet, if you look out the windows it is clear they aren't moving. In helicopters, the pilot sits in the right seat, unlike most aircraft. He did all the flying from the left. The helo pilot used a grenade launcher to shoot at the graboid, but the were no grenades and/or explosions.

I could go on. The problems with this film, kind of ruined it for me. Esp. since they weren't consistent and/or even inconsistely consistent. It's like they got the budget, way overspent on CGI and then couldn't afford a writer, director or a script, so they just went with the first movies, only in different settings. (They did this, somewhat, with Tremors 3: Back to Perfection. Only in a way that made sense and was funny.) The only thing they didn't re-do was Burts rant about the government declaring imminent domain on them.

Bert Gummer, our beloved survivalist and gun nut, is the only redeeming factor in this movie, and sometimes he isn't enough to carry this beast.  There are some situations, such as when Bert is in a cage, that move firmly into idiocy.  Not to spoil the plot, but an outdoorsman like Bert would never strip his clothes off so that he could get severely sunburnt.  He'd know better.  Apparently the writer didn't.  Miraculously, he didn't get sunburned.  Apparently urine is good sunscreen as well as insect repellent.

Graboids do develop a new feature, and I won't spoil that for you, so watch the movie for that and the few good moments.  The new second banana guy is some nobody that is horrendously annoying, and I nominate him to be number three on the graboid menu.

This is a classic B- movie.  Have lots of popcorn handy.  Preferably enough to obscure the TV screen.

Ive been a big fan of the TREMORS franchise for many years.  I saw the first film over two decades ago in the theater, and I absolutely loved it.  As a rabid fan of creature features, it was right up my alley.  So when the direct-to-video sequels began to emerge, I was a bit skeptical.  After all, nothing can kill a franchise like terrible follow-ups that are destined for bargain-bin hell.  But thankfully, the later titles have been entertaining for the most part, thanks to some tweaks to the mythology and some liberties with the special effects.

TREMORS 5: BLOODLINES is probably my favorite sequel thus far.  This film reinvigorates the dark wit that helped define the original, and it also adds some interesting depth to the creatures.  Granted, its not perfect, but it is a lot of fun and very entertaining.

TREMORS 5: BLOODLINES is shot well and looks like a big-budget film onscreen.  The production team played it smart and actually made the film on location in South Africa.  This goes a long way in building credibility for the movie; theres nothing worse than losing immersion in a film due to fake surroundings and lackluster sets.

The acting in TREMORS 5: BLOODLINES is good, with Michael Gross once again reprising his fan-favorite character, Burt Gummer.  Nobody else in Hollywood could play Gummer, and Gross once again pulls it off with ease.  Joining him this time is Jamie Kennedy.  I have to confess I was hesitant about this casting choice, but thankfully, Kennedy does a fine job with the role.  My sole complaint about the cast (and its not a complaint about the film) is that Reba McEntire does not rejoin to play Gummers wife, Heather.  She has not appeared in any of the sequels, but I feel she is certainly due to return.

The special effects are decent, however I am again disappointed to see such a big reliance on CG for the worms.  The original film boasted some top-notch practical effects, and I would love to see a return to that.  The CG in TREMORS 5: BLOODLINES is pretty good for the most part, yet there are a couple of scenes where the animation is blatantly obvious.  This isn't a huge detractor for me, however I do feel it worth mentioning.

Overall, TREMORS 5: BLOODLINES is a win for me, and I really enjoyed it.  You cant go into a sequel and expect it to be as good as the original, so make sure you have the right mindset before you watch this.  If you do, chances are youll be in for a good time.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1444694400,2,2577,4.523809523809524

I don't think these 'super' Graboids would have been quite as menacing had they been practical puppet props.

The special effects are good, but I still miss some of the practical ones.  I wish the music for this one was better, like if you watch the second movie, it has a very unique theme song, and I wish that they had done something like that for this one.  I wish we had seen Perfection a little bit instead of just the desert, but I guess they were saving that for the next movie.  The African Graboids are truly epic, and put a new twist on the monsters we know and love.  I don't know how they plan to top them later on, but the best I can come up with is the that government ""Modifies"" them somehow to of course turn them into weapons.  I feel like they sort of made Burt a milder version of himself here, but he is getting old so I guess he's written that way on purpose.  Jamie Kennedy is not terrible and actually works for the movie instead of against it.
But sadly it does seem that a little bit of the old magic just isn't there, I'm not exactly sure what did it, but it feels.. off somehow.  But you can't take a franchise that hasn't seen a new installment in about a dozen years and just duplicate what made the others work, I understand that.  It's still an awesome movie, and it's great that they found a way to make it new and still make it work so that people will love it just as much as the others.
I was very happy when I heard that this was coming out, and I was not disappointed.  It's worth the wait.
This is one of my absolute favorite franchises and I sincerely hope they make more movies.
I didn't actually watch the Blu-ray for this, my copy is still in the mail.  But I did watch it on Netflix.  I will update this review of the Blu-ray set when I get it.

Update:
Finally got the Blu-ray copy, here we go.
The quality of the Blu-ray is just what it should be, though the menu screen will confuse you at first.
The special features are great, as in we actually get some.  Instead of just a bunch of trailers for other stuff, we get deleted scenes which are really cool, there are some that I wish they hadn't cut.  The gag reel is okay.  Then we get a behind the scenes feature, which personally I didn't find to be such a big deal.  Definitely get the Blu-ray for this, it's worth it.",1444435200,11,2384,4.099137931034483

Okay, so I deserve to be heard because 1. I'm rarely moved to write reviews and 2. I actually saw the first movie in the theaters and have purchased every sequel since then ... And every time a sequel has been announced I've crossed my fingers (kinda like you did when they announced a new Phantasm).

Here's the bottom line. Ignore any review that's less than a five star because it's written by someone who isn't part of our family ... The Tremors family.

This is the best Tremors movie of all. Period.  It's the most fun. The most thrills. Newbies can watch it and be up to speed within five minutes (smart move D.M.P.).  Plus it has something all the others don't ... it has a glorious heritage that it resoundingly lives up to.

All those people whining about missing Kevin and Fred need to get with reality and realize that they haven't been ""part of our Tremors family"" since 1996. Read that again Bozo ... 1996. The Mighty Mike kept it going and he is at the top of his game in this one. It totally rocks. Jamie Kennedy deserves major props too for being the perfect partner for BG.  In fact everyone in front of and behind the camera deserves a group hug.  This is clearly a work of love by everyone involved and their love shows.  The story is great, the editing is great, the jokes are great, and the FX are 100% on the money.  It's even got genuine jump scares ... Zoiks!  Not only that but, as a guy, it would be remiss of me if I didn't mention that Pearl Thusi as Nyala is the hottest Tremors babe ever. Make that EVER.

 In this movie, not only does it take place in Africa, but they are clearly referencing that our character Burt Gummer is way to old to hunt Grabiods now. He looks like he is reaching late 60's early 70's for what the Director has portrayed his character's age as. This time we are joined by another fan of Burt Gummer's work who wants to hunt Grabiods with him like the Grady from Tremors 2: Aftershocks. He insults Burt Gummer right off the bat by saying that his brand needs to be re-branded to get him back on the top of fame like he was in Tremors 1,2, 3, and Tremors the series. Here I noticed that they are defiantly looking to re-brand the Tremors franchise and have Burt Gummer pass down the torch so another actor can take over the franchise.

As we go further into the film there are  using the usual Tremors attack sequences leading up to seeing what the Graboids look like.
Those who are familiar with the Tremors franchise are used to the campy movie style technique the directors use and the gore that is included with each Tremors attack. Instead of puppets and basic gore effects used in the earlier films; this is all done in CGI. I think the Tremors franchise has really held up well with the updated CGI effects. Not only is CGI included in the Grabiod attacks, but we come to find out there is a new evolution that has taken place in the Grabiod life-cycle. Without giving to much of it away, you guys will have your minds blown!

There are also new methods put into place when killing the new evolution of the species. The movie really focuses on what Burt Gummer would do without all of his fancy weapons and dynamite, which in turn is bringing it back to the glory days of the first film of the franchise. I won't give too much of twist away, but it sets itself up nicely for another movie in the franchise with an all new actor. Burt Gummer has officially and unfortunately probably won't be in the next Tremors film as a main actor due to his age. However, I think he will make cameo's in future films until he dies. I hope my review has more meat in it then most we have seen on amazon so TRUE Tremors fans know what they are getting into. Get it? More meat? :D",1444089600,37,2438,4.268398268398268

Gummer is teamed with my least favorite group of helpers to date and the CGI changes in the monsters didn't interest me at all.  I hated the new looks and wish they had stuck to the original designs as Gummer takes his battle to Africa with a web cam TV show guy in tow.

When I first heard Kennedy was in it I was a little disappointed but instead of going with the annoying version of Jamie Kennedy He went the normal good version and was really good. Bert heads off to Africa to hunt down an ass-blaster only to find out things have evolved. I hope they make a part 6.

7334420,4,B011KME78M,"Most sequels hope to hit the outside of the fan dartboard with each new installment.
Tremors 5 does not. They know you know what ""Tremors"" is about, and you deliberately sought it out. And they reward it brilliantly.
My personal biggest gripe was the exclusion of a particular Graboid stage, the aftershocks of which can be felt.
But mostly, this is the sequel Hollywood should strive for. They reimagined, retold, but most importantly, expanded on the franchise in which it was built.",1444089600,,485,4.926829268292683
7334421,4,B011KME78M,Tremors 5 was better than i'd thought it would be. The only issue i had was that burt now has a son that he didn't know about before? It's most likely that there will be a part 6 and that's the reason for this new character. I just hope it doesn't take another 12 years to get made. Also it would be nice if earl and val were brought back. 9/10,1444089600,,344,3.859154929577465

Nothing will ever beat the original but this Part 5 is one of the better sequels. The Gummer is as good as ever. Pearl Thusi is a hot actress was good in this movie. Jamie Kennedy casting seems slightly off in the context of this movie but he did well too.",1443830400,3,379,3.986842105263158
7334428,4,B011KME78M,"OK so I've actually watched this movie which so far qualifies me more then any other review here at this point in time.
The Gummer goes to Africa were there are a new species of Graboids and Ass blasters but they look radically different because you know everything is bigger in Africa.
The stakes have been raised as these are fierce and way more mobile with one neat surprise that I won't mention.
Heavy use of CGI but at this point its par for the course.
And for some reason I don't remember seeing any Shriekers at all.
Jaime Kennedy looks a little rough but did OK and the intro was good parody of survivalist TV shows.
All in all it was pretty entertaining but the ease in which they dispatched these bigger more ferocious Graboids and Ass Blasters was a bit of a letdown.",1443744000,40,779,4.379310344827586
