1221750,5,B00000IBUK,I've never personally read the anime'. My daughter liked this one. I think she wanted it to check out the series to see if she wanted more.,1266451200,,139,4.185185185185185
1221751,5,B00000IBUK,"I must say I am deeply impressed with this entire series, including the movie. When I watched the first 13 episodes, I was hooked. Then I purchased the black rose and apocolypse saga (which gets more intense). This is a truly mind-blowing series that can get anyone hooked even if your not into shojo anime. Be WARNED: Even though this is from the director of Sailor Moon (whom I might add admits to prefer anime with Yuri element) this is not at all like Sailor Moon. This series is not for kids, other than that enjoy!",1208390400,,520,4.427083333333333
1221752,5,B00000IBUK,"Revolutionary Girl Utena is about a middle school girl who vows to become a prince after being rescued by a prince when she was a child.  She unwillingly gets caught up in a ritualistic dueling cult, so to speak, to win posession of the Rose Bride, a girl that seemingly has no will of her own.  But the story develops into far more than that, integrating the student council duelists and their personal lives into this huge web of psychological trauma and disturbance.

I will say first that Utena is not for everyone.  To the standard anime watcher, Utena will seem very strange and repetitive,and that will deter some people.  But trust me, the series will start to develop into a complex psychological romp while keeping its strangeness and humor to balance it.  The characters and their problems continue to build throughout the 39 episode series.  This first arc, episodes 1-13, only scratch the surface of all of the characters.  The second arc delves into the minor characters connected with the student council, and the series really begins to pick up speed in the third arc when questions are answered in a not too pleasing way for Utena.  I will not deny that it gets repetitive at times,and you will hear the pre duel song until you want to scream.  But it is a wonderful, twisted fairy tale, and a peek into the not so normal lives of adolescents.

And as a side note, I would recommend not watching the Utena movie until after you finish the show.  Not that it really gives any spoilers, but it's easier to understand the movie.  Why they recommend it after the first 13 episodes when one of the most important characters hasn't even been officially introduced is beyond me.  For most fans, you watch the movie for the pretty.  But if you think the show is weird...well.  You haven't seen weird.",1203724800,,1809,4.6415094339622645
1221753,3,B00000IBUK,The artwork is very good.  The problem is that the story reuses video segments over and over again to fill time.  The series does not have a strong story line.,1173312000,,159,4.266666666666667
1221754,5,B00000IBUK,"When I first heard of this series I wasn't sure If I would like it or not. But after borrowing a tape my friend recently bought and watching a few episodes on it, I KNEW I had to see the rest of this series. The animation and character design is very beautiful, The sword fights are a sight to see, and the songs are so lovely (even the metal is awsome to hear). All in all, so far I have really liked this. Can not wait to see the rest (I want to see the dark stuff heh heh).",1147824000,,476,3.8181818181818183
1221755,5,B00000IBUK,"I have all the Utena DVD's; all 39 episdoes and let me just say, this anime is AMAZING!! It is by-far my favorite anime... If you were debating over wheter to get this anime or not, get it. It's fabulous!! BUY IT NOW!!",1102636800,,218,4.093023255813954
1221756,4,B00000IBUK,"Revolutionary Girl Utena is an anime that's both empowering and intriguing.  It takes place in a boarding school where the students hold power over their teachers, the entire female population has a crush on a girl, and the school has a dueling arena with and upside-down floating castle.  In the first collection, we're introduced to this world, as well as to Utena, an unlikely shojo heroine.  Unlike the ditzy, lazy Sailor Moon, Utena has aspirations to become a heroine, and to save others like she has once been saved.  We also meet the ""princess"" Anthy Himemiya, the Rose Bride, and the student council.

I haven't seen the whole series, but I like Utena for tantalyzing its viewers - for giving hints of a deeper story beneath the ""duel-of-the-day"" formula.  Also, the villains of Utena are three-dimensional.  Saionji is an abusive [...], but at times he shows genuine love for Anthy.  Miki would be the ""nice one"" in the group, but one can see that he also duels for his own self-interest.

For breaking the mold and its tantalizing plotlines, I highly recommend Revolutionary Girl Utena.",1102118400,,1097,4.886486486486486
1221757,5,B00000IBUK,"Dear Mr. Solomon,
I must admit that when I first started watching anime, I was a little cautious about it.  The Japanese culture seemed so far fetched to me, that I wasn't able to fully grasp it's delicacies at first.  However, after watching several VERY impressive anime series, including His and Her Circumstances, Love Hina, Fruits Basket, Steel Angel Kurumi, and Please Teacher, I have found that anime is something more than just a cute cartoon.
  Anime is an adult movie, not for children unless they are very mature.  It explores mature themes, such as, in Utena at least, homoeroticism (not homosexuality, homoeroticism is feeling romantic love for someone of the same sex), incestuous love and its dangers, criticism of those who would beat someone faithful to them, and the threat of an impending Apocalypse.
If you show Utena to young children, I suggest you rethink it.  But Utena as an adult movie is fantastic.  Beautiful animation, beautiful characters, and a look at life as it really is, not closed behind doors as in Hollywood.  Sure, most of the characters are barbie-doll figures, and unrealistically proportioned, but the trials they go through are reflective of the human condition in a way that cartoon series in the US are not.
  Watch anime for the culture, the art, the deeper message behind the cute and bouncy exterior, Charles Solomon.  Stop watching anime as though you're a little kid.
  Sincerely,
  A Literature and Philosophy University Student",1075766400,,1479,5.02880658436214
1221758,5,B00000IBUK,"When I first picked up this series at a local video store, I expected it to be some cheesy, melodramatic shojo (girls') anime. Was I ever wrong.
Utena, superficially, is the story of a determined young girl who goes through many trials for the sake of her friend, the Rose Bride, Anthy Himemiya. Underneath all that it is a heavily symbolic story about the balance between masculinity and femininity and humanity's struggle against its own flaws.
Utena is directed by Ikuhara, who also did Sailor Moon - but be warned, Utena is nothing like Sailor Moon. While the anime is still lighter than the original manga, it deals with controversial subjects such as incest, rape, and lesbianism. Young children can watch Utena without fear, as it contains no nudity or violence whatsoever, but a ten-year-old simply won't get the complexity of plot in Utena, which was written for teenagers.
Ikuhara's handling of Utena is superb: the music, the animation and the voices are great - but the English pronounciations are still awful (Utena TenjOH, people, not Tenjoo). Utena is a geart watch even for guys; you can't call yourself an otaku if you don't see it!",1062547200,,1149,4.86734693877551
1221759,5,B00000IBUK,"When I saw the first episode I was more than a bit confused, I thought, 'hey, maybe the next one will clear things up', but it just got more and more complicated.
What I like about this serie is that it's original, I mean, which other serie can you name that has an unwilling heroine looking for a mysterious prince from her past ending up in a strange academy where people are fighting to possesss the equally mysterious 'Rose Bride'?
Initially I only watched the first load, the Rose Collection, it was left me by my cousin, and afterwards I was just like...man, why didn't he have the REST?!!! It's truly an original masterpiece, just what I'd expect from the director of Sailor Moon.",1057449600,,687,4.548387096774194
1221790,5,B00000IBUK,"Are you tired of episodic shows like Sailor Moon and Card Captor Sakura? Do you want more out of your anime than girls changing into short-skirted superheroines or animals fighting each other in controlled battles? Do you want to see something deep--something that makes you think about what you're watching? Well, that is Revolutionary Girl Utena for you.
It starts with a girl dressing as a boy--and not just any boy, but a prince! She rescues a princess in the form of the Rose Bride, who is traded among the Student Council members as they win/lose fencing duels. Utena joins this group and befriends the shy, quiet doll that is Himemiya Anthy, the object of the duels. Along the way Utena has to contend with the insane Vice President Saijoni (who is obsessed with Anthy), the cold fencing team captain Juri, the suave womanizing President Touga, the child prodigy Miki, Touga's jealous little sister Nanami, and Miki's dominating twin sister Kozue.
They fight for the Rose Bride because she carries a hidden power that will allow her master/mistress to revolutionize the world, according to specifications set by the End of the World, who organized the whole thing. Utena fights just to protect her strange friend Anthy and to find the prince that rescued her when her parents died.
Warning, there are controvesial themes in this series, although it is not as explicit as the Utena movie. Incest abounds between Kozue/Miki, Anthy and her older brother(whom we meet much later), and Nanami longs for the affections of her brother. But Touga has his eye on another girl in the show...
This is a wonderful series and I wish I could give it more than five stars. It makes you think about many things, and leaves you with answers to questions you went even aware you had been thinking.
And the music rocks!",1046217600,,1807,4.813504823151125
1221791,5,B00000IBUK,"After viewing the Utena series, the biggest surprise for me was finding out that it was actually produced by the same people that made Sailor Moon. Indeed Revolutionary Girl Utena has very little in common with Sailor Moon besides being the same shoujo genre. At first Utena doesn't even realize the existence of any sort of magical power, but she learns fairly quickly through her deuling experience. I found this to be one of the great strengths of this series - the fantastically wonderful character development, especially Utena, of course, but also of the other student council members, Juri, Nanami, Miki and also Saionji. Anthy and Touga are a little less developed to help keep a mysterious dimension to their characters. In addition to the multi-dimensional characters, there is also a multi-dimensional story, with three separate arcs. The story can be complex and confusing, but if you enjoy puzzles as I do, you will find the challenge very entertaining. The animation and artwork are just full of symbolism. I've heard some say that the Utena series has more symbolism than any anime ever made, and since I haven't every anime, I don't know for sure, but this series would be real tough to beat on that note. So if you are prepared to think a little you will love this!",1033603200,,1282,4.831818181818182
1221792,5,B00000IBUK,"Revolutionary Girl Utena is the rare shoujo that can seamlessly integrate drama, comedy, fantasy, action and romance into a series that is a joy to watch.
  Utena dreams of becoming a prince, leading her to enter prestigious Ohtori Academy.  There the ring she wears pulls her into a series of duels competing for an awesome, awesome prize(I won't spoil it for you).  The student council(the members of which Utena duels), Utena's friends, and others are pulled into a blend of slowly unraveling mystery and drama.  The ending of the series(episdoe 39) is one of the most confusing anime moments ever constructed(in my opinion), however the deft character construction and growth(which paints the characters as having much depth, feeling, and moments of startling intelligence and expressiveness)- far superior to the likes of Sailor Moon- makes this an excellent, excellent buy.  Finding the other episodes is well worth the search!
  A word of warning: incest(inferred here, shown in episodes not available to buy on Amazon) and (non-explicit)sexuality makes this inappropriate for preteens.",1030233600,,1093,5.3882352941176475
1221793,5,B00000IBUK,"This is one of the greatest anime series I have ever seen in my life, and having been a fan of the manga for about 3 years now, I feel no regrets for spending the money on the fansubs and again for the DVDs. The anime is very very different and you'll find that the plotline is nothing like any other anime you've ever seen before. It is also a wonderful analysis of society, both Japanese and American. When I read the manga I was so astounded at it's beauty that I knew that it would be great as an anime too. When I saw the anime, there was no doubt that it was my favorite series of all time. I'm glad we're getting the DVDs in America now so more people can enjoy it. The dub on this DVD is one of the better ones I have seen. The voices match well and the translations are very accurate. Previously I had the entire series on Japanese DVD (yes...I even went out and bought a DVD player in Japan to view them) and Chinese DVD (because it would play on my DVD player, but the cover art wasn't as good as the original) and I had the entire thing fansubbed as well. I also plan on buying the black rose, akio, and apoloypse sagas should Viz choose to release them. Many people see this as a frivolous waste of money, but  I think not.",1014422400,,1236,4.065573770491803
1221794,5,B00000IBUK,"Without much fanfare, Utena is one of the greatest Anime series ever, and easily stands tall with Evangelion, CowboyBebop, and Noir. I own both of the TV-series DVDs and also the recently released movie, and I have already seen the remaining entire 39-episode series through fan-subtitled/distributed files downloaded from the internet. I'm currently anxiously waiting for the next TV-series DVD editions to come out (hurry up Software Sculptors!), and cannot recommend the series enough for any type of anime fan.
The series has some of the most engaging characters of any anime. The main character (Utena)'s resolution to become a prince meets many twists and turns throughout the series in her interaction with numerous other characters, most of whom you get attached to in one way or another by the end of the series. The storytelling is a journey of human emotions; using surrealism, dark satire, symbolism, and metaphors, it tells of what it means for a person to have a purpose, to have a feeling, to grow up, and to love. There are some episodes that will cut through the viewer's emotions to bring out sorrow and pity for some of these characters, only to have the viewer also realize that their plight is very real - real people have similar motives and consequences, as displayed on screen by the characters. But this is not your Fushigi Yugi/Ceres melodramatic fare - the emotions that this series evokes is not due to melodrama, but due to the dark realities of human nature that the characters act out for the viewer to see. But those of you who are seeking comedy should not shy away, because the series has blissfully many of them as well, many of which become funnier when you see it again.
If you like emotionally and intellectually sophisticated anime like Evangelion, but without its violence, and yet do not like the ultra-slow psychomania that is Lain, then you will absolutely love Utena. Do not be fooled by the cover - this is NOT Sailor Moon-alike. It is a sophisticated series filled with clever and sometimes dark, yet subtle humor, and progressively better and outstanding storytelling. Buy yourself the 2 DVD TV series first, then download and watch the remaining episodes online, then buy and watch the movie, and buy and watch the 4 remaining DVDs that are hopefully coming out soon by Software Sculptors/Central Park Media. Even you Cowboys and Trunks and Gundamites will heartily enjoy and treasure this series.",1011139200,,2445,4.9225181598062955
1221795,5,B00000IBUK,"Utena is an INCREDIBLE series, and if you want to hear raves, you can read all the other reviews.  The important thing to remember, about Utena and most anime is that it's NOT for children.  The official review of this DVD lists it as appropriate for ages nine and up.  Ridiculous!  The plot, subplots, and characters are far too complex for children, and there are numerous violence and sexuality issues that are definitely not intended or appropriate for a juvenile audience.  Utena is wonderful, but enjoy it for yourself, not for your kids!",1007769600,,544,4.806451612903226
1221796,5,B00000IBUK,"I am a male and I LOVE this series.  I would recommend this to anyone who has dreams of the fantastic.  It is about Utena, a high school student who gets involved in duels to protect her friend Himemiya.  Very entertaining.",1003449600,,223,4.390243902439025
1221797,5,B00000IBUK,"I cannot help but agree with the previous reviews....Utena is extraordinary!  I was hooked the moment the opening sequence started to play....I have been a devout Utena otaku for two years now, it it continues to be my all time favorite anime series!  It's bizarre, unique, and fascinating story line is not all this wonderful series has to offer-it has a beautiful soundtrack as well as mesmerizing animation.  Trust me, it's all around complexity will leave you stunned (and it only gets more complex as you travel through all 39 episodes)!  Hands down, Kunihiko Ikuhara is the most brilliant man to ever grace this planet!  Even more good news---Adolescence Mokushiroku, the Utena movie, is going to be released on DVD late this October!  If you haven't seen the movie yet, you don't know what you're missing!",994636800,,812,4.9338235294117645
1221798,5,B00000IBUK,"Fromt the makers of Sailor Moon comes this very different anime with a twisting plot that is as mysterious and action packed and funny as it is romantic. Utena was a young girl who lost her parents and was impressed by a prince who comforted her. She decided to become like a prince herself, guarding the rights of those who needed her protection. This goal and her rose signet ring which the prince gave her, lead her to the Ohtori Academy where she becomes mixed up in the student council's duels to posess the Rose Bride and the power to revolutionize the world. Utena doesn't fully understand what's going on, but is willing to fight for the honour of the Rose Bride and her own self... The only thing wrong with this box set (it has a lovely display pictures!) is that it only contains episodes 1-13, the only ones released in America. If you want to know where to get the rest of the 39 episode series, contact me at my e-mail.(Note: After a few months of this review being up, tons of people have e-mailed me about this last comment. That's just great! It makes me so happy that people want to get the rest of Utena. If I could write a review on the rest of the episodes, I would, but where would I put it now?

1221799,5,B00000IBUK,"I remember last year hearing many people buzzing about this show, and this year I finally found out why.  Shoujo Kakumei Utena is, by far, one of the most original anime series I have ever seen.  No monsters of the day, giant robots, or super fighters.
This first disc introduces many of the main players in this beautiful drama, that at times, had me laughing very hard.  We join Utena Tenjou on her quest to find her prince, at the mysterious Ohtori Academy, where she meets a girl who will forever change her life, Anthy Himemiya.  What follows is a never-ending twist and turn storyline, showcasing the light and dark of each character.
One reason I love this show is because there truly is no real 'good' or 'bad' guys, everyone merely... well, is.  I will say, do the sub.  The dub is terrible!  The voices do not fit the characters at all.  Enjoy this, and let us all pray that the rest of the series will be released soon.  For the revolution of the world!",992390400,,964,4.431818181818182
1221820,5,B00000IBUK,"If this doesn't take your breath away then nothing can!
Utena is the most amazing shoujo (girl's) anime I have ever seen, if not THE most amazing anime I have ever seen. It's tough to rival this incredibly creative series.
Often criticized for being to 'weird' I praise Utena for it's bold moves in the world of shoujo!  An interesting and *completly* unique plotline... this is like nothing you have ever seen before.
Pushing the limits on sexual barriers, and always keeping you guessing and surprised, the craziness of Utena can capture any heart.
Mature viewer's will enjoy the depth that the creators went into on every episode, including new battle themes with amazing lyrics that pertain to each character. New songs every episode, and all of the music is enough to make your heart sing. An excellent opening and closing theme, and new battle themes each episode you can NEVER get bored listening to Utena.
The main plotline is a young girl named Utena who goes to the Ohtori Academy. She was visited by a Prince when she was a very young girl and he gave her a rose signet ring. Ever since then she has dreamed of becoming a prince herself, and she dreams of being able to save young princess' from danger. When she gets into a duel with Saiyonji over the welfare of a friend she discovers a whole new world where she can finally become the prince she alwasy dreamed of.
A battle arena with an upside down castle, and a rose bride who can summon the power of Dios into a sword. Whoever wins the duel becomes engaged to the Rose Bride, who turns out to be a fellow student named Anthy. When Utena wins the duel she most adopt Anthy as her bride. Although at first Utena is skeptical of the shy and akward girl, they soon develop a strong bond that cannot be broken.
Pairing up against beautiful bishonen Saiyonji who seems to be rough and coarse, Touga the head of Student Council who is quite the ladies man, Juri who scares even the teacher's, Nanami who is in love with her big brother Touga, Miki who only has eyes for Anthy after she plays his paino song plus numerous other characters like Wakaba and the cute Chuchu you can tell that Anthy and Utena are going to be having the time of their lives.
The DVD set includes the first 7 episodes, most notably 'Take Care, Miss Nanami' where the cute young Tsuwabuki is introduced to the scene.
I recomend watching in subtitled version, as the dubbed version isn't very pleasant on the ears.",986428800,,2448,4.525959367945824

1221822,4,B00000IBUK,"Revolutionary Girl Utena is a wonderful anime, but this first saga of the story is a bit boring compared to the following episodes.  This DVD contains the first seven episodes in the Student Council Saga, and is mainly used to introduce the characters of the story.  If you are a shoujo fan, you will absolutely love the colorful atmosphere, silly humor, and amazing characters.  It is like a more mature version of Sailor Moon.  But even non-shoujo fans may enjoy it for the fast-paced sword duels, intriguing and surreal story, and the bizarre music.  This DVD contains both English and Japanese dialogue, with optional subtitles.  I thought the english voices were annoying and lacked much-needed emotion compared to the Japanese ones.  There are few extras on this DVD and the story can be a bit dull and over-dramatic in spots, but don't worry; things will pick up with future episodes.

Each character has his or her own unique story of their own involving it's own twists and turns and strange interactions with the stories of the other characters. It'll... let's say... ""blow your mind.""
The first thirteen episodes only provide a minor glimpse of the thickening plot to come. It does, however, provide a foresight to upcoming events and the series cannot exist without it unfortunately.
What I reccommend: buy it! Because seeing this is vital to seeing the rest of the series. I just wish it would move a bit faster in the beginning...",975283200,,747,4.7984496124031
1221825,5,B00000IBUK,"First off, like the others before have said, don't buy this thinking that it's some kind of offshoot of Sailor Moon.  This is a more serious anime, with gorgeous artwork and music that blends perfectly with the various scenes.  I *LOVE* the opening song for this series, in fact, I bought the soundtrack because the music is soooo awesome.  The ""Apocalypse"" and duel songs are the best!!
  On to the story, which is the very essense of this anime.  On the surface, is the story of an orphaned girl named Utena who is searching for her lost prince.  Not finding him anytime soon, she decides to become one herself so that she can rescue other ""princesses"".  My thinking is that she was soooo desolate when her parents died, that she wanted to die too.  So when the Prince came along, he gave her the incredible gift of hope, and now she wishes to pass that gift along as well. Such a simple story, becomes so much more as the story unfolds.
 Anyway, her journey leads her to Ohtori Academy, where her tomboy ways get her on the teachers' blacklist.  It's there that Utena crosses paths with Anthy Himemaya, a very soft-spoken, quiet girl who takes pacifistism to the extremes, as she never fights back to those who would oppress her.  Utena's fate becomes forever entwined with this mysterious girl after Utena unwittingly duels in the school's secret arena.  For Anthy is the Rose Bride, and *she* is the prize of the secret duels.  She holds the key to the Absolute Destiny, Apocalypse.
 Will the secret duelists win the Rose Bride and bring about the Apocalypse?  Will Utena solve the mystery of the Rose Bride, and find her long lost Prince?  Will Anthy ever grow a backbone, and fight back?  What is ChuChu, Anthy's only friend?  Is it a mouse or is it a monkey??  Will Wakaba ever get a clue?  Will Software Sculptors *EVER* release the rest of this series?????  Once you watch the first episodes or so, you will want to buy the rest of this series!!!  Take My Revolution!!!

1221826,5,B00000IBUK,"Utena is a strange, strange story.  At its simplest, it is a fairy tale set on its head: the heroine, Utena, is a girl who wants to be the prince after being rescued by a prince when she was a little girl.  Her goal leads her to Ohtori Academy, where she finds herself drawn into a series of sword duels for possession of the Rose Bride, another girl at the school.  If that sounds odd, it is, but it's really the least bid of weirdness.  For example, the wonderful soundtrack shifts between light classical and rock opera (for the duels).  A castle hangs upside down from inside a building.  Wild animals pop up unexpectedly all over the place.  The whole thing is surreal; even the characters' eyes are drawn in a style which, by anime conventions, suggests they are dreaming or hallucinating.
This first disc contains 7 episodes (out of a total of 39, of which 13 are translated into English as of November, 2000).  The stories introduce the characters and establish the initial paths of the conflicts between them--the basic question being, why do these people want possession of the Rose Bride?  The characters are interesting, the stories are unusual and fresh, and the English voice acting (if you're watching the dub) is well-done for all the major characters.  One thing to watch out for: the disc proclaims ""From the director of Sailor Moon.""  In Japan, the audience for Utena and Sailor Moon might overlap; such is probably not the case in the US.  The themes in Utena are much more adult than most would want to have pre-teen girls watching, including domestic violence and hints (at least in this disc) of homosexuality.  There is no nudity here, but there are some rather suggestive scenes.",973382400,,1704,4.716216216216216
1221827,3,B00000IBUK,"First off, if you've seen the ""By the director of Sailor Moon"" flash on the cover of this set & are expecting more of the same, beware - this is a *very* different show to Sailor Moon!  Instead, we have a somewhat deep plot about a cross-dressing schoolgirl competing with a group of fellow students (who themselves seem set on bringing the apocalypse, or ""cracking the world's shell"" as they put it) over the control of the Rose Bride - another young student under the full control of the current duelling champion.  Still with me?
It's an interesting story with a good mix of dramatic and comic moments, and not at all 'typical' anime.  It took me to watch the disc a few times before I got my head around what was happening & started to appreciate just how good the story is.  I wouldn't recommend it for casual viewing or for people who prefer their entertainment to be light and fluffy!  Also, it seems to be aimed more at the mature end of the market - parents might worry about the 'mature themes', and I'd bet a lot of the story would go straight over a young kid's head anyway.
Overall, worth a look if you're prepared to think about what's going on on-screen.  Pass if you prefer mindless entertainment.",970876800,,1213,4.46606334841629
1221838,5,B00000IBUK,"This is a series that is almost too advanced in its plot, art, music, and character depth to be considered truly shoujo. I guarantee that anyone who sees this will be spellbound. The characters are so laden with issues that  you'll simultaneously love, despise, envy, pity, and ultimately relate to  many of them. This is nothing like ""Magical Girl Sasami"" or  ""Sailor Moon"", with their twee, happy-go-lucky stories and  lovably quirky characters. Although the voice acting of the dub is not  quite up to par, it's far superior to the dub of ""Sailor Moon"". I  highly, highly recommend this series.",963187200,,597,4.92
1221839,4,B00000IBUK,"The basis for Revolutionary Girl Utena's storylines goes something like this: cute middle school girl unknowingly gets caught up in a magical and romantic plot.  Oh, wait: that's *every* shoujo manga and anime plot.  What  makes this one special is the witty and well-crafted dialogue, as well as  some weirdly stylized [even for anime] animation [including a Greek chorus  and shadow plays!].
Utena is a cross-dressing young girl who wears boys'  uniforms because she thinks it makes her look noble and dashing, just like  the prince who gave her a rose signet ring when she was younger.  At  school, some mean guy on the school council who slaps around girls  besmirches her best friend's name, so she challenges him to a duel..  unaware that the members of the school council actually belong to a secret  society of megalomaniacal revolutionaries [natch], who routinely duel for  the privelege of controlling the Rose Bride.  The Rose Bride is a pretty,  subservient, dark-skinned young girl who likes to clean and cook named..  get this.. ""Anthy Hemimaya"".  No kidding.
Political Correctness  aside, this series is really quite entertaining.  I recommend it to anyone  who likes shoujo manga or anime.",957916800,,1205,5.11340206185567

1221842,5,B00000IBUK,"Ok, first thing I want to say is GREAT JOB to Software Sculpters for mastering this series with the original Japanese elements (in the form of cast, crew, etc in Japanese script)  A LOT of companies usually delete  these out, like what Pioneer did to Fushigi Yuugi.  Definitely one of the  better shojou titles I've seen so far.  A beautifully woven story filled  with action, romance, mystery, intrigue, and a LOT of surprises, Shojou  Kakumei Utena keeps me watching!  Can't wait to see the next one!  If  you're looking for an anime that's not so run of the mill, not what you  expected, GET THIS DVD!",954201600,,604,4.60377358490566
1221843,5,B00000IBUK,"When I saw the first volume at the video store, I was skeptical, but I'm glad I tried it.  All though it seems marketed towards girls (with the pink boxes and all) it's good and interesting material no matter who you are.  The plot is wonderful and strange, in fact, it's unlike anything I've ever  seen.  Anime has become a collection of cliches, with the most successful  anime those which put those cliches together the best rather than being  original (aka Escaflowne).
  While a lot of the standard anime  conventions are in here, there is a lot of new stuff, too.  Most of the  characters are based around personalities rather than a single character  trait & a contrived tragic past (like we have in most anime).  You  won't find the ""spiky-haired, blonde & boisterous  martial-artist"" or the ""bouncy, big-busted,  schoolgirl-packing-heavy-weaponry"" here.  Although many of the male  characters have the stereotypical long-haired, slender, Girl's Anime  appearance, they're all much more deeply characterized, and the heroine  does not bubble over them like in most girl's anime-in fact, they seem to  be the anathema of her tastes.  Utena's character is almost an ideal-she's  strong, smart, tough, and righteous, but without being preachy or  melodramatic, and is not bubble-headed or overly-effiminate as most anime  heroines tend to be.  She's a true tomboy (again, not the contrived idea of  a tomboy present in most anime),and she is presented in a matter-of-fact  way that makes her much more real than most ""perfect"" heroes.  Unlike most supposedly strong anime heroines, she does not slobber over the  various pretty-boys, or act as though having a boyfriend for the big dance  is a matter of life or death.  In fact, she doesn't concern herself with  these things at all.
The plots are well done and reasonable, though the  main plot of the ""End of the World"" seems to get lost for a few  episodes, and it instead becomes a social commentary and a satire  (especially the episodes involving Nanami), but I didn't mind.  From what  I've seen so far, Utena gets involved in a weird plot involving the Student  Council, where challengers duel to possess the ""Rose Bride"" (the  duels are not fought for blood-to win you must knock off a rose pinned to  your opponent's chest), and the final victor is destined to receive some  great power.  Fans of gritty, dark stories, or the mindless, derivitive  blood-and-breast anime that so many seem to think is the pinnacle of  animation may not like it, the story is pure romance (Romance as in  idealistic fantasy, not as in love and relationships), a sort of modern  fairy tale.  Think Don Quixote over Sailor Moon. One note, though, the  lyrics of the battle themes have the most ridiculous lyrics I've ever  heard, anywhere.  Even worse than Escaflowne's one-lyric songs.  Absolute  Destiny Apocalypse plays every time Utena prepares for a duel, and each  battle has it's own laughably bad song.  The beginning and ending themes  are really good, though-the lyrics of the opening song actually make sense  (again, unlike most anime).  Also, I know everyone else is denying it, but  I'm telling you there is a very subtle but very strong and clear homosexual  subcontext to the story.  No, I don't think the characters are gay, but  it's definitely suggested a LOT, and very blatantly at that.  This may just  be fan-service, though-homosexual themes are very popular among girls  anime.",953424000,,3446,4.964726631393298
1221844,4,B00000IBUK,"The first time I saw Utena I was like, this is from the Sailor Moon people. The plot was so much better than SM and it seemed much more mature, if not a bit harder to understand. Well, I watched it a second time and I  completely fell in love with one of the characters. I don't care if he is  supposed to be three years younger than me, Miki is one of the coolest  anime chara's I have ever seen, and the stop watch thing is soooo cute. If  your a fan of anime, or someone who wants to see what all the hype is  about, then this (and Fushigi Yuugi, my absolute fave anime) is for you.  Believe me, you won't regret it!",953424000,,619,3.912
1221845,5,B00000IBUK,"Okay, first things first. There is so much to say about this show. A lot of people are thrown off of this anime because of the unusual art style. PLEASE don't let that stop you! This series gets better with every episode.  Every wicked plot twist brings an answer to an old question, along with a  brand new set of questions! And if you start analyzing all the subplots  going on, it will only get you hooked more.  The character growth in this  series is amazing. There are some you will think are very small part  sidekicks that will really suprise you later on! And then Utena Tenjou is  just awesome; a strong, confident female lead that keeps going no matter  what the odds are (even in the shadow of a math makeup exam!). Utena is an  anime that will draw you in and leave you wanting more. (And the episodes  that follow these are even better!) Plus, whether you like subtitled or  dubbed videos, this is excellent in both areas. The English cast is well  fit to the characters and the dub script is very faithful to the  translation, unlike many other dubs. Recommended to anyone who loves a  great storyline, and I promise, it will only get better on the next DVD  release!",952819200,,1182,4.432558139534883
1221846,3,B00000IBUK,"Okay, I admit it.  I'm addicted to Utena.  I saw this box set with a friend and was immediately hooked.  The entire story pulls you in, each line is there for a reason, and there are interesting hooks that they don't  explain in the box set (like Miki's stopwatch, you'll know it when you see  it.)  That just serves to make you want more.  I've managed to get ahold  of all but the last 3 episodes (Japanese friends are good) and it only gets  better as each episode and story arch unfolds.  I swear to you, this  will change your world.",952560000,,538,4.227722772277228
1221847,4,B00000IBUK,"This television show is based on manga by Miss Chiho Saito. The television show consists of thirty-nine episodes. This is the taleof a fourteen year old girl named Utena Tenjo, she is an eighth grader who likes to dress in a boy's school uniform, fence, and play basketball.  When Utena was younger, suicidal and filled with much sadness as a result of her parents' deaths, she met a prince on a white horse (literally).  She was so touched by this prince and their meeting that Utena aspired to become a prince herself to rescue princessess and at the same time find her prince, especially since he gave her a ring and said that it would one day lead her to him.
Now, as an adolescent woman attending Ohtori Academy she comes in contact with the student council.  They are men and women who also wear the same type of ring that Utena's prince gave her.  They fight secret duels for the possession of the Rose Bride and to revoluionize the world.
Also Utena meets a princess (literally) in distress, Anthy Himemiya/the Rose Bride.  She is a solitary girl who is constantly harassed by other students; she has no will of her own, and serves as the obedient servant to whichever council member wins the duels. Anthy's ill fate begins to take a change in a different direction when Utena ends up winning a duel and becomes engaged to her.  Utena uses this engagement as an opportunity to try to help Anthy regain her will and to keep her safe form the other Council members.
The story is far more complicated then my summary and is filled with so many different themes like: sexism, gender-role stereotypes, identity formation, abuse, women's rights, revenge, childhood fantasy ( the prince on a white horse coming to save the princess), jealousy, hatred, love, and self-esteem.  It's just the kind of show that'll outrage you at times and fill you with joy and hope at others, because of all the things that it involves.  This is the kind of story that not only dazzles you with beautiful animation; it grips you with emotionally powerful storytelling, and makes you really think.",951264000,,2078,4.68956043956044

1221859,5,B00000IBUK,"Upon first viewing the Utena series one is left with one question... ""WHAT?""  This does not ever stop the viewer from continuing to watch the show, looking for answers to the question.  Before you know it, you've watched the entire tape and are in desperate need of more.  Utena has a way of sucking you in.  The universe created in this show is  both extraordinary and intriguing.  The show keeps you guessing, keeps you  laughing, and keeps you wondering just what exactly is going on between the  characters.  In short, a fantastic show.  The DVD is the way to go.  Two VHS tapes on one DVD with all the bonus features such as being  able to jump to the ridiculous songs and being able to watch in japanese  which is a must for any anime fan.  While Utena does a much better job of  staying true to the original dialogue and concept, being able to watch in  japanese is always a plus.

1221892,5,B00000IBUK,"This is one weird show.
For characters, we have a high-school elite dedicated to total world revolution, a young girl who somehow embodies the magical power to bring about that revolution, a round purple thing about  six inches high named Chu-Chu, and our hero, Tenjou Utena, who dresses like  a boy as part of her ambition to become a prince and save damsels in  distress.
For a setting, we have the Ohtori Academy, an exclusive  private school which looks a bit like the Tuileries crossed with the  Vatican.  The giant upside-down castle hidden in the forest on the back  lawn bears mentioning as well.
For plots, we have a whole lot of  different stuff.  The story lurches back and forth from fencing duels over  the end of the world to Saved-By-The-Bell-esque teenage hijinks to  absurdist comedy and back 'round again.  Just when you think you've gotten  an idea of what Utena is about, it takes off in another direction again.  This is probably the most interesting element of a show which already has  plenty to recommend it.  The animation, done in a shoujo style somewhat  reminiscent of SAILOR MOON (hocch! ptui!) is above average for a television  series.  The music, from the fast pop opening theme to the bizarre choral  background music, is addictive.  The characters are engaging and  intriguing, in particular Utena herself.  But above all what recommends  this series is the entrancing weirdness of it all.  I doubt you'll have  seen anything like this before.",918864000,,1477,4.8785425101214575
