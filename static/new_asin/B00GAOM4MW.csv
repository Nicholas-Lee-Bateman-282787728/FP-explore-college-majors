8621632,5,B00GAOM4MW,"This is filmed with much higher resolution than the first series (which is also worth a watch), and Andrew's destination is fantastic! To find the source of the Okavango. It's a river & delta which has inspired me all my life and to go into Angola, which is an infrequently visited place, find the source and then track it all the way to its end. Wow, what an expedition. I've seen the waters of the Okavango delta creeping along over the dust and felt Andrew's excitement while he tracked down the ends of the rivers. As always, it's 4x4 driving without any silly macho rubbish, with genuine concern and love of nature, and well worth a watch! I'm super-inspired to go to Africa again and buy a landcruiser and see where it takes me!",1403568000,,734,4.485074626865671
