5157473,3,B008F0CT24,"I really liked Jennee as an instructor and her variations on barre genre exercise, it was fresh.  The DVD had a tutorial of ballet terms/form for the commonly used elements which was good for those who don't have any ballet background.  There were no exercise participants as modifiers so you are on your own.  I thought the workout was well put together and Jennee is a pleasant, businesslike instructor, just my cup of tea.

My big complaints were the ""music"" -- truly dreadful annoying techno IMO, without any capability of turning off the ""music"" and just having the verbal instruction.  Jennee, please take the hint for your next DVD.

Obviously my biggest complaint was the plie section, as you can tell by the title of my review.  I can tell you that professional ballet dancers do NOT do 376 plies for a warmup.  I think it is irresponsible to put home exercisers through that, it is setting people up for a repetitive stress injury.  It is not necessary to do any more than 25-30 plies for good thigh work and warm up, doing it with good form.  376 plies is definitely overworking the quadriceps and the knee joint.",1347494400,21,1124,4.6313131313131315
5157474,5,B008F0CT24,I've been doing Jennifer Galardi's Ballet Body for over three months and I have been looking for a similar workout.  I have tried several others and could not find any as awesome as Galardi's until I found Ballet Blast.  Galardi is a great introduction to Ballet workouts and Jennee offers a more advanced version with way more cardio and weight training.  This video is easy to follow and yet fast paced and very challenging.  I love love love this video!,1347062400,4,456,4.6625
5157475,5,B008F0CT24,"This ballet-style workout begins with a brief (but fun!) warmup.  Then you move into plies -- lots and lots (and lots!) of plies! And we hold our arms out by our sides the entire time; this may not seem like much, but after 15 minutes, my arms were burning! Next is the cardio, which is basically ballet kicks.  Another reviewer mentioned ""ballet burpees"" -- when Jennee said we were going to do ""burpees"", I thought, ""for REAL?""  NOT my favorite thing to do.  Here we go down with wide legs, kick 'em out straight, back to wide legs, then return to standing with some plie pulses.  Well, they're DIFFERENT, but they're STILL not my favorite thing!  ;-)  Next up is sculpting using light weights.  I skipped the intro, so I don't know if she gave recommendations for weight poundage, but I wish she would have here.  There are overhead side lifts, bicep lifts, tricep kickbacks, shoulder presses, and ""kettlebell"" swings.  She used the same weight for this entire section, but I would like to have used lighter weights for some moves (like windmill arms) and heavier weights for other moves (like kettlebell swings); and she moved too quickly for you to switch on your own without missing some of the repetitions.  Next was ab work on the floor, then finally a stretch.  I liked how the stretch started on the floor then moved to standing with some flowing movements.  The setting was bright and pleasant, and the music was upbeat.  All in all, this was an excellent low-impact cardio & toning workout.",1344384000,6,1502,4.683206106870229
5157476,4,B008F0CT24,"I'll admit it -- I'm a barre addict. I've probably contributed sizable amounts to the Burr Leonard and Tanya Becker retirement funds. However, because I also have workout ADD, I'm always on the lookout for new barre workouts and the pickings have been mighty slim lately. No one seems to be releasing any new titles right now. (Except for Pure Barre. They are nothing if not prolific.)

So, I've branched out. This crept up on my radar and, because I'm equal opportunity as well as easily distracted when it comes to workout DVDs, I don't mind crossing genres (as it were) and dipping my toes in the Ballet, Callan, and pure Lotte Berk sections of the pool. Let me tell you; this is SOLID. And you will get worked - and worked harder - than other straight up Ballet workouts that are out there; Balocity and Elise Gulan's Element: Ballet Conditioning being the 2 that I've done most recently and can compare to Ballet Blast.

Jennee is very much a ""get down to business"" instructor. Not a useless chatterbox is this one. She is backed up by 2 other exercisers and she hits you hard from the start and doesn't let up. She offers some modifications, but they're a bit sporadic. There also isn't a dedicated modifier background exerciser.

The DVD is chaptered so you could potentially customize your workout if you are short on time. However, the time FLEW by and, while it clocked in around 48 minutes, it sure didn't seem like it.

The highlights are definitely the pli section (of which she loves doing, so owners of sensitive knees, do beware) and the cardio section which is sandwiched in the middle. Ballerina Burpees were a ton of fun to do and I think I may do those instead of regular Burpees because I have a massive hate on towards regular Burpees. Yes, they're a necessary evil but doing them ballerina style? They still mean business but the dread factor is severely lessened.

This is a solid intermediate to advanced workout. You don't have to have a dance background to do this (I don't and I managed to keep up with only a few hiccups here and there -- precision will come with doing this workout with more frequency, I'm sure) but you do need to have a decent background in overall fitness.

A minor downside is that form really isn't emphasized outside of the intro and demo of the various moves (she reminds you to ""make it pretty"" during the workout itself but that's about it). I was able to keep my form in somewhat check (abs in, shoulders down, triceps tighter instead of flailing wider like they were showing, etc) for the most part because proper form and posture are beaten into you in Physique57/Bar Method DVDs. Beginners should proceed with caution and definitely watch this a few times before attempting it. But I'm not a doctor nor a professional trainer so always proceed with caution whenever attempting any new workout routine.

The other minor downside was the abs section. If you have a sensitive back, about 75% of the ab work is done in C-Curve position, so do keep that in mind. Some people like C-Curve, others like neutral spine, while others (like me) just want to be screaming in burning agony because our TA and obliques have been put through the wringer. And then put through again for good measure. This really didn't put me through the double wringer (not even single wringer) and, had I had more time, I probably would have added on and done another more ab-centric workout after finishing this one up.

These 2 downsides + lack of continual modifications = 4 stars.

Now for the nitty gritty:

Cueing? Darn near spot on. I did get a little mixed up on sides, but that was my own fault.

Sweat factor? Well, for me, it was very high. But I'm one of those profusive sweaters and was also working out in an apartment that had its AC turned off all day (and it was 100 degrees that day) and was still in the process of cooling down. Hmmmm...Bikram Ballet? I'd bite! I don't wear a heart rate monitor but this definitely had the ol' ticker thumping and thumping consistently high.

Music factor? Upbeat and not overbearing.

Space limitations? None. And I live in a 650 square foot apartment. On the top floor. There was jumping, but not to the point where my downstairs neighbor would think a herd of elephants was crashing through the roof.

Necessary equipment? A mat and weights. Because I have hypermobile joints, I tend to go lighter on weights and do higher reps. I used 2lbs and think the girls on the DVD were using 3lbs weights. You could probably go heavier. YMMV.

All in all, I think this will be included this in my rotation on days that I'm simply dying to do Ballerina Burpees. Which, now that I know they exist and how to do them, might be more often than not.

**EDIT: 8/8/12** They say that the key to doing anything is consistency. And I've found myself returning to this DVD at least once a week since I initially purchased it about a month ago. I've come to discover that the more you do this workout, the more you will get out of it. While I don't have the choreography and moves down pat, I do feel a lot more comfortable with them and, because of that, I think I'm getting a better workout in. If you're a higher intermediate to advanced exerciser who's looking for something new to do (and get in touch with your inner ballerina), definitely track this one down. It's solid and, for those of us with no dance experience, it will grow on you, you will feel more comfortable, and you'll find yourself wanting to throw it in your weekly rotation more than once. Recommended and I look forward to future titles from Jennee.",1342656000,39,5589,4.546268656716418

8527211,5,B008F0CT24,"I am by no means a trained dancer, but I absolutely love this workout.  By the end of plie section, I am sweating buckets.  I do this workout a few times a week and still enjoy it after several months.",1487462400,2,201,4.0

8527213,3,B008F0CT24,"Too many plies.  There are so many other things she could have done to avoid the repetition of plies and more plies.  The arm workout with weights  and yes, seriously, most of the arm workout is while doing plies!) was a lot of throwing the weights around.  She does not understand that swinging the weights is not the proper way to use them and the lady in the grey tshirt was throwing the weights and her back with them.  The front cover with the tutu is just silly - I'm sure a lot of people won't buy the dvd because of that.  I liked the ab workout with weights.  A good workout but much room for improvement.  It is difficult to find excellent dance conditioning workouts.  Kari Anderson's Center Floor is by far the best out there right now.",1438646400,3,748,4.323741007194244
8527214,5,B008F0CT24,"The cardio pace & plie ""jumps"" (NOT in a plyometric way, more like plie hops), is what makes you
""Blast"" calories with this Ballet workout. And like my cheesy review title says, I think it IS FUN!
I once worked out to this dvd with my 20-something year old niece and even SHE -a Jillian Michaels' workout junkie-
really liked the burn she got out of it.

I strongly disagree with the other reviewer who claimed that the warm-up itself has over 370 plies.
I can understand it's tough on their knees but to say Jennee does that many plies in 13 minutes, as that person wrote, is not only a lie but I imagine also practically IMPOSSIBLE. Within the 50-minute workout Jennee DOES spread out hundreds, yes, hundreds of plies; but they ARE spread out within aprox 40 minutes of the workout (it ends with mat work for abs & a stretch). Because these type of ballet workouts are best performed barefoot or wearing yoga socks (as I like to do),
some impact is to be expected.  That's not to say it's high impact. I have a bad knee and this doesn't affect it.
I like to place two squares of puzzle mats over my living room area rug for higher impact workouts- just a matter of preference-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-X-24-X-9-16-Extra-Thick-Multi-purpose-Gray-Mats-Set-of-4/dp/B003TU3ZZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24"" X 24"" X ~9/16"" Extra Thick Multi-purpose Gray Mats (Set of 4)</a>&nbsp;though I think for this workout a yoga mat might work just as well.

My favorites are the Ballet Sculpt segment (arm focused) and Abs Blast segment (no dreadful crunches!) -which both require light hand weights. I uploaded images of the main menu and extras sub-menu above since the back cover doesn't specify that it actually has chapter menus. This is especially useful for me because I sometimes like to incorporate these two segments after doing other leg-focused barre workout from another dvd, to make total body. Jennee is clearly good at what she does; you have but to look at her toned, sculpted body -so motivating seeing her workout throughout the entire dvd! At one point she loses her balance for a second and graciously points out with a smile ""Don't do it like that"". And I don't mind that her instruction doesn't include exquisitely detailed form pointers for every single move, to me the form pointers she gives are sufficient to correct my form without slowing down the choreography. After all, good posture IS implied in ballet.

Another reason this workout is worth owning is that it is quite different in that it requires no barre or chair, all while being very doable and non-intimidating. So major bonus: it challenges your core balance! In other words, it's not all arabesques and eternal pulsing moves being held, just a true ballet style plie' fest with side and front kicks -or ""grand battements""- among other moves: ballet burpee/plie hop combo, passes, tendus, etc. So it's a great intermediate to advanced workout, (depending on your fitness level -I'm a seasoned at-home workout enthusiast in my early 30's if that helps in any way.)

I really liked the pretty dance studio setting, just because I find nice backgrounds help me get in my ballerina zone;
versus other dvds fillmed in a small, plain or all-white set.
Over the year that I've owned this DVD I've purchased others: Element: Ballet Conditioning with Elise Gulan&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Ballet-Conditioning/dp/B000WC38BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Ballet Conditioning</a>&nbsp;,

and Xtend Barre: Lean & Chiseled... The point being that this is one of the ones I look forward to doing again the most! :)

If I must point out any cons (for the sake of the next DVD, should Jennee decide to release one)
I would say minus a quarter star for each of the following:
One, the music volume was a little bit louder than I'd like, although I did like the music - very upbeat, although, I do think it was well chosen in the sense that it played to the beat of the moves and it matched Jennee's energy (see YouTube for preview). Second, the ladies in the back were a bit serious (smile ladies, it's not bootcamp!). And third, the price, $20 is more than I'm used to paying for a workout dvd, as I collect many.  But... considering that this one's a keeper, I'll pass it for a long term health investment.

Nevertheless, overall rating for the 50 min workout itself? Definitely 5 TUTUS! I mean STARS! ;)",1388016000,8,4955,5.384516129032258

8527217,5,B008F0CT24,"After looking at the promo video several times, I finally purchased this workout; and exercised to it this morning! While I'm no stranger to muscle toning workouts, I am new to the ""barre"" style workouts. This is a thorough workout that focuses on technique as well as form. It might be repetitious to some with the back-to-back plie portion; however, this is a solid workout that incorporates both the lower and the upper body. I like the fact that she uses weights for the mat section. I used five pound dumbbells since that's all I have on hand; I believe the instructor is using three pound weights. The only modification I made for myself, was to wear sneakers. She does mention in the intro. part that it is low impact, but after ten minutes into the video I put my sneakers on. I still was able to point my toes while doing the ballet portion. Excellent workout; will be one of my ""go to"" workouts!",1354320000,5,905,4.490909090909091
