Perhaps I am wrong, but I would guess the director also stars in the movie.... why else would we listen to his ridiculous ramblings....?

Would never recommend!",1460160000,,305,4.648148148148148

VENICE/VENICE: Dean (Jaglom) is an independent filmmaker attending a film festival in Venice, Italy. One of his numerous interviewers is Jeanne (Alard), a Parisian journalist smitten with his films and their sensitive insights. His wheeling, dealing and schmoozing at the festival, however, shatters her romantic illusions about his screen persona, and she leaves, disenchanted and disappointed. Cut to Venice, California, some time later. Jeanne shows up unexpectedly at Deans home to pursue their initial attraction. Problem is, Deans already living with someone. Whose true love will overcome all obstacles?

Discussion: Its really hard to think that real life exists independent of the movies, Jaglom-as-Dean admits. He might as well have entitled this film Real/Reel, as his experiments in cinema faux verit reach new heights of integration here. Or is that new depths of self-indulgence? The film ponders that question too, as well as more important questions, like: How do movies affect our life, especially in terms of self-concept and romantic expectation? And: Are movieseven realistic moviesan accurate reflection of life? Illustration is punctuated by discussion in a brave attempt to blur the border between life and film.

Admittedly, the film has its flaws, which are magnified by its audacious experimental nature. Its occasionally frustrating to watch Jaglom grapple with a subject he cant quite seem to bring into sharp focus, for instance, and despite his defense and denial of self-indulgence, he occasionally flirts with narcissism. He must have [expletive deleted] big enough to fill a blimp hanger, for example, to expect to pull off a realistic scene in which his past, present and future lovers all share a heart-to-heart, and all end up liking, understanding and respecting one another. Now theres a self-indulgent fantasy! particularly when he plays Dean as a cranky, obnoxious, abrasive and sometimes downright nasty little egotist.

Yet despite its flaws, this is the film Jaglom has been trying to make most of his lifeand its as unique and thoughtful an attempt to fuse film and fact as has ever been committed to celluloid.",1423008000,,2410,5.219638242894057

8188328,2,6304161514,"Jaglom is not original in style and pretends to apply Woody Allen's style and method to his film.
I thought I was watching ""Interiors"" or another drama directed by Allen.",1342569600,,170,4.7
8188329,5,6304161514,"Wow - this is the first Henry Jaglom movie that I have seen, but you can bet I'll be seeing more.  His interviews with the women and how the movies influenced their perceptions of how relationships ""should be"" was incredible.  In almost every single interview segment, I had a little, ""yup, that sounds right"" experience.  Yes, the romance was wonderful, as was the duality of the Venice, Italy life with the Venice, California life.  And I had my own ""wouldn't it be wonderful to be floating around on a canal in Venice"" point of view.  So I was doing exactly what he shows us the movies do! ;)  Anyway, a wonderful film, I plan to buy it, and replay it whenever I feel the urge to run after that ""perfect man who will sweep me away and solve all my problems.""",1034208000,8,761,4.361702127659575
