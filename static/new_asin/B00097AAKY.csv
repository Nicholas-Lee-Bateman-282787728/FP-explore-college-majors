8057784,5,B00097AAKY,"I probably own about 90% of the makeup books on Amazon. I consider myself an educated amateur -- I don't have a cosmetics license and  I don't know about stage makeup. However, I'm beyond most makeup guides now, even those purportedly written by makeup artists.

This DVD tells about specific products, exact shades and even professional techniques in brush and sponge application. It goes way beyond the tried and true ""set your makeup with powder to make it last"". The last time I had a DVD that was this professional was my Alexis Vogel DVD.

I wish there were more looks! Sadly, I just read where the star was killed in a car crash in November, 2011.",1331942400,2,654,4.572649572649572
8057785,5,B00097AAKY,"This artist has such a wonderful personality, it is easy to watch her do hours of makeup application. Her tips were great. The demonstrations were detailed and fun. The makeup looks were very nice and her day to night explanations were great. All around, my favorite video in the batch that i ordered. Great for all of us who had to learn how to put stage makeup on later in life. This is awesome.",1308182400,,397,4.378378378378378
8057786,5,B00097AAKY,"""Jeniviva,"" a makeup artist and dance performer from New York City, presents a generous helping of ""how to"" create make up, hair, and accessorizing reflecting the Victorian era in ""Femme Fatale.""

Sit alongside,in front of a well lit mirror or good lighting for a step by step consultation on creating three complete femme fatale looks: Victorian vampire, flapper vamp, gothic Lolita. It is easy to follow along as Jeniviva talks to you,as if you are sitting beside her and she patiently goes through the following:

The preparations section begins with a blank canvas or clean face.
Each distinct look requires proper steps such as: Concealing skin flaws and applying foundation correctly which are key elements. There's more, such as defining the eyes with proper shades, liners, and color, shading the cheeks, and blending all colors, also applying false eyelashes. Complete the look with a fall, (wig), hair ornaments etc.

 Each ""look"" lists the product used to avoid guess work. The Victorian hair section has a great tutorial on finger waves using gel and a water spritzer. I found this section requires some help for sectioning and holding the waves together. The basic elements of Victorian fashion follows. Learn how to coordinate outfits together using a corset and accessorizing on a shoestring. This section covers a basic ""how-to"" since there are many variations to gothic looks.

 Anyone who is budget conscious can create these three  beautiful vintage looks from common  drugstore items such as: Q tips, tissue, make up remover, moisturizer, scotch tape, assorted brushes for contouring and blending, eye lash curler, foundation, concealer, eyeliner, mascara and lipstick in varying shades of deep red.

Enjoy an interview with Jeniviva and Tanna Valentine.

Any performer,gothic diva, or whosoever will want to vary their look for stage, or parties can benefit from this program's great useful tips and technique.",1305158400,5,1931,5.281045751633987
8057787,4,B00097AAKY,Three different fashions that are relevent to todays fashion.  Lots of information to tweak into your own personal style including a little blips about how to add into your everyday work week.  The makeup tut. is very in depth but the fashion info only scratches the surface.,1302912000,,275,4.829787234042553
8057788,5,B00097AAKY,"I am recommending this DVD to any belly dance student who is not yet comfortable with applying makeup and for those who want to know how to get a more dramatic look.  This is not just for belly dancers, though.  This is for anyone who wants a dramatic look to go out to dinner for the evening, or go dancing, be it clubbing, salsa, or ballroom!
This DVD also covers three hairstyles that are made easy by the step by step instruction.  Note that the hair styles are Victorian, 1920's fingerwaves, and the Lolita look that is accomplished with hair falls.  The best and most fun way to use this video is to set up your mirror and makeup and follow along with Jeniviva.  Have fun!",1300665600,7,678,4.349206349206349
8057789,5,B00097AAKY,"This dvd gives very detailed instructions for creating 3 femme fatale looks, victorian, flapper, and gothic lolita.  While I'm a little beyond the gothic lolita look (age-wise), it would be possible to do the other two looks.  Jeniviva gives all sorts of tips and pointers along the way, discussing each product that she uses and offering alternatives if money is an issue.  There was also chapters on creating just the right hair style for these different looks.  I know Jeniviva is a makeup artist, but here style and delivery make me feel that even I, with some practice, could approach these looks, maybe just a little less dramatic for the day.",1297900800,6,649,4.81981981981982
