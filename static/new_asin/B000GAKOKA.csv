8129798,5,B000GAKOKA,Gave me a better perspective on communicating with my horse. I loved watching this inspiring gift Mr. Hempfling has with training horses.,1378080000,,137,5.2727272727272725
8129799,3,B000GAKOKA,"I didn't consider this as a how-to book in training, but rather a book that is long on 'wow'. I believe that Mr. Hempfling is a great trainer in his own right and I respect that from the contents of the book.",1360022400,,208,3.9761904761904763
8129800,5,B000GAKOKA,"This is a must read for anyone interested in befriending their horse rather than dominating him or her.  Klaus Hempfling illustrates the fundamentals of natural style horsemanship without the hype but takes it to a much deeper level, he understands the ways to communicate with a horse which transcends behaviourist 'training' methods.  This way of his can lead to collected riding on a loose rein so ultimately he can achieve a relationship which makes the communication commonly seen in dressage competition look like coercion by comparison.  The DVD with the same name is a good companion to this book.",1255219200,,605,5.090909090909091
8129801,4,B000GAKOKA,"I really loved this book and gained some valuable insights from reading it.  I have also watched the DVD, which was very nice, but less informative.",1168300800,3,148,4.6923076923076925
