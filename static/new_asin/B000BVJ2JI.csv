8628385,3,B000BVJ2JI,"I should have read the title more carefully.  I was hoping the film would be about the ancient Maya, but it is about modern day Maya, which I can see now by the subtitle.  I probably should give it more than 3 stars since, if one is looking for information about Maya descendants, this documentary is fairly well done: good photography, and it is accurate according to information I have come across during my research of Maya history, and also while on a tour of Maya ruins at sites in Belize and Guatemala.  But you won't find much archaeology in this film.",1284076800,,559,4.46078431372549
