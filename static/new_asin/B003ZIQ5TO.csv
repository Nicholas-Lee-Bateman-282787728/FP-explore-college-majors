4234079,5,B003ZIQ5TO,"This is an amazing show to have. It gives the same feeling as being there in the audience for the show in person. The extra videos are also a nice behind-the-scenes look at the show.

This is a great way to relive the the concert.

If they aren't coming too close to where you live, this is a great way to see the concert.",1291593600,,322,4.015625
4234080,5,B003ZIQ5TO,I thought this bluray was awesome. I have watched it several times now and I enjoy it the same everytime!!,1290729600,,106,4.35
4234081,4,B003ZIQ5TO,"The music is fantastic, and for a first effort, this is a great package.  A couple nitpicks...
Interviews between songs should have been dropped, or there should have been the option to watch the entire concert from start to finish without interruptions.  Yea, even a minute or so of the intermission.
The Advent Rising transfer is horrible.  No other game looks that bad, and the camera recording the screen looks fine, but direct transfer footage is just awful.
Lastly, it's in 1080i, not p.  Not a huge deal, but something to note.

All that said, I'd still pick up the package, particularly for the price it's being offered at.  The music is wonderfully performed, and if you're a fan of video games (which, if you're looking at this, you probably are), it's worth a purchase.",1287964800,11,780,4.7407407407407405
4234082,5,B003ZIQ5TO,"This dvd is the best way for those who aren't able to see the concert live the opportunity to see this event, and the best thing is, it's like having the best seats in the house. The quality of the video is excellent, thanks to the blu-ray capabilities, and as if the music wasn't excellent in the first place, the sound is crisp as well.
The nice thing about the show is that it casts a broad net for their audience. You don't even have to play video games or know video games to appreciate and love the show. For game veterans it's a celebration of the games they love. For the casual or non-players, it's a fun experience to learn and in a way experience the wealth of music, visuals and pop culture that these games bring. Either way, the energy from the show is like nothing else. Video Games Live has been touring the world since 2005 and this is their first dvd release. It's about time.
If you enjoy this dvd, I would also look into their cd compilations as well.",1287705600,,971,4.282608695652174
4234083,4,B003ZIQ5TO,"A little bit about the concert first; I have never been to a VG LIVE concert but I have been to a Final Fantasy ""Dear Friends"" and the recent ""Distant Worlds"" concert.  So picking this one up I knew what to expect.  Great music but familiar in a different light with all the cool (but cheesy) theatrics.  In all honesty, hearing your favorite gaming tunes in a live symphony and choir is truly an unforgettable if not inspiring experience.  Really, words cannot describe how these or in this case VG LIVE concerts are; IT IS SOMETHING TO BE EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND.

However if you were unable to make the concerts, Shout Factory was kind enough to grace us with this BD/DVD combo for your home viewing experience.

PRESENTATION:
I am one for the full home theater immersion of a live concert with no interruptions (except to what is actually happening at the concert) but I am not too fond with the side commentary before each presentation.  They should of had an option to watch the concert without commentary. Not experience ruining for most but that is just me, it feels a bit disjointed.

VIDEO:
Despite what the box labels (1080p) this concert is encoded in 1080i. Surprisingly though, this is a very clean transfer that would rank next to other great Live Concerts such as Rush, NIN, Incubus, Within Temptation, etc. Though sometimes it does look a bit soft in some shots, that is to be expected in a low lighted environment. But definitely for the most part it is an eye pleasing and crisp picture.

AUDIO: DTS-MA
If you are expecting an aural experience as with most great live concert BDs, VG LIVE somewhat fails in this department. For the most part it trumps the clarity and projection found in standard DTS counterpart. But what you really getting is a front heavy assault with the surrounds left for the audience.  Most live BDs achieve the envelop sensation almost perfect, this one not so much.  Maybe this was by design, but it sounds more like a Jazz Club rather than an Amphitheater. It is a bit disappointing, but overall the great music lets you hear past this.

EXTRAS:
Loads of extras on this one! If you are an old school gamer like me, you will probably appreciate the interview with Ralph Baer (Father of Video games), the making of Dragon's Lair, and the documentary on Tetris. But other than that there are bunch of behind the scenes and interviews.

Overall I would say pick this one up. Whether you are a BD enthusiast, musician, gamer (of course), you will enjoy this 100%.  These concerts stand apart from many others you will ever see. Check it out!",1287446400,7,2581,4.631578947368421
4234084,5,B003ZIQ5TO,I saw this on PBS and had to look to see if I could order it.  Can't wait until it's released!  It's a wonderful blend of classical music and exciting graphics.  Great for all ages!,1285545600,,181,4.114285714285714
4234085,5,B003ZIQ5TO,"So while I understand that this product hasn't been released yet...I'm writing this review based on the fact that I was in the audience of the show they filmed for the DVD/BRD in New Orleans.

I can only hope that not much was edited out of the final product. This show was so engaging that it was sick! While I used to work in the performance industry, the person I brought with me to the VGL show had never seen or heard a live orchestra before. He was blown away by not only the audible aspects but the visuals as well. The local Philharmonic and Choir were absolutely flawless and actually entertaining to watch. ..especially in the final piece of the show then a rather senior cellist stands up, lets his hair down, and begins to head bang alongside Tommy (the creator of VGL) while still playing perfectly.

The energy of the performance enchanted people of all ages and backgrounds in the audience. Diehard gamers like myself salivated over hearing familiar musical scores brought to life in front of us, while non-gamer parents stared listlessly at the operatic performances of some of the vocalists is such pieces as Advent Rising and the Intro to Civilization.

Overall, purchasing this DVD/BRD is wise. Not only is it a great addition to any media library, it also shows your support for video games as ""Art."" I've got mine on pre-order and I can't wait to relive the experience again. Thanks Tommy, Jack, and everyone else...come back to New Orleans soon!!!",1285545600,4,1469,4.708171206225681
4234086,1,B003ZIQ5TO,"I watched this with the understanding that they would play final fantasy music, as that is what I had read as a track listing for this. Hour plus lost, get the credits right. After a search finding what I waited so long to hear, I find it sounds awful. Dont mess with something which already sounds great. Either do a good job, if not better, or simply leave it alone.",1393891200,,368,4.271428571428571
4234087,4,B003ZIQ5TO,"The DVD seemed a bit short and there was a few songs that I was surprised weren't on there (For example: One-Winged Angel or any FF music) but overall it's pretty great.

Aside from the amazing music they did, they also showcased the Video Game Pianist and also had Ralph Baer on stage for a moment which was pretty cool. If you like good music or good video games, this is definitely for you. As someone who grew up loving both, this was perfect for me!",1392768000,,454,4.27906976744186
4234088,4,B003ZIQ5TO,I really enjoyed this performance.  Everyone song that is played gives you the sense of how epic video games have become.  The fault of this production is that Tommy distracts when on stage. The other distraction is the montage from the games whose themes are being played.  The endless loop becomes a distraction from what is a great performance.,1391472000,,347,4.8474576271186445
4234089,5,B003ZIQ5TO,"There is a  incredibly beautiful, indelibility, resplendence, star bright concert, that I never seen before, I like it so much, it's so worth.",1389052800,,142,5.173913043478261
4234090,5,B003ZIQ5TO,I am not a gamer but I do love music. I truly enjoy most of the selections and the intermingling of footage from the various games with the music is neat. Highly recommended.,1379030400,,174,4.303030303030303
4234091,5,B003ZIQ5TO,If your a fan of video game music especially from Nintendo's stable of classics like The Legend of Zelda or Mario to contemporary games like Halo or God of War. You will definitely enjoy this movie of a live show of Video Games Live with a actual orchestra.,1377734400,,257,4.375
4234092,5,B003ZIQ5TO,A wonderful performance of excellent VGM compositions. Truly brilliant!  What really makes it work though is the clear love of the medium that Tommy Talarico and the team bring to the performance.,1377043200,,196,5.125
4234093,5,B003ZIQ5TO,Some of my favorite games were in this show. So great to hear. Anyone a diehard video game fan this is for you.,1376179200,,111,3.869565217391304
4234094,5,B003ZIQ5TO,I can't say enough good things about this video. The way music was brought together with the video games was beautifully done. The performances were rock solid and joy to watch. The interviews also gave great insight behind the concepts behind the compositions. Highly recommend it!,1361750400,,282,5.1521739130434785
4234095,5,B003ZIQ5TO,It arrived on time and was brand new. I recommend this vendor. If you like the music in video games then you are going to love this.,1361232000,,132,3.925925925925926
4234096,4,B003ZIQ5TO,"it was fun listining to the music. been trying to go see it ""live"" but wife wouldnt go because its video games but it caught her attention and is willing to go if it ever makes its rounds again",1361145600,,193,3.9743589743589745
4234097,5,B003ZIQ5TO,I bought this for my son as he plays piano. I was trying to expand his ability to play music that he knows and loves.  Low and behold the whole family sat down to watch the orchestra.  That same night my son decided to learn Halo thanks to this movie.....,1360800000,,255,4.08
4234098,2,B003ZIQ5TO,"Overall, this blu-ray is okay. It's just hard to sit and watch the main sponsor (which is the only reason I can guess that he's allowed to stay there; he also introduces each song) spaz out for the entirety of the concert. He's given a baton to seem somewhat worthwhile, but the real conductor can be seen in his official chambers. Besides that, this is close to 4 hours (you heard me!) long. Also, most songs played are from obscure Sony PS1 titles that only the guy and the 2 people each in the audience who said, ""Whoo!"" for had ever heard of. The origional LEGEND OF ZELDA theme is there, so I can't discredit it totally; but I can't recommend it either.",1341792000,,658,4.357723577235772
4234099,5,B003ZIQ5TO,"This DVD is simply amazing, for game lovers and music lovers that's all! The idea of joining music and games was original and brought together two passions and mixed generations, me and my son (who is 6 years old) really loved it. The DVD is well worth buying.",1327795200,,260,4.4375
4234100,4,B003ZIQ5TO,The disc is good overall except Square Enix did not let them put Final Fantasy music at the end (which is actually advertised on the disc label sticker) which really ruined the climax of the concert. I see no hurt if they allow it as this product is not really competing with Square's concerts. People love it would like to get all related items as they are totally different good experiences.,1319587200,2,393,4.549295774647887
4234101,5,B003ZIQ5TO,"I attended this show live in New Orleans where this was recorded.  Wow - I had no idea it would be the same show on the video.  I knew they were recording but I thought they might record them all.  I enjoyed the show live and the recording. Some have said that they thought the discussions took away from the music.  Without the discussions you would lose the history that was being presented.  When the music is being played there is no discussion.  This is colorful, dynamic and exciting.  The Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra is featured in this show.  One can also buy the music on a DVD.  I have both.  Don't miss out on this gaming musical entwining visual and audio entertainment.  Yeah LPO!  Who Dat New Orleans.",1312848000,,720,4.5390625
4234102,5,B003ZIQ5TO,"After have seeing some of these videos on YouTube and having missed the PBS special I finally decided to buy this.

As the description says, this Bluray has music from Megaman to Final Fantasy to Super Mario. I am eagerly awaiting my purchase.
Anyone who is a fan of any of the aforementioned video games is wise to pick this one up.",1309564800,,333,4.370967741935484
4234103,5,B003ZIQ5TO,"For all ages, this was great!
Now i must rent Level 1.

To think how many of us searched you-tube looking for people playing these video games tunes on a piano.
Then to see some of them appear live on stage.
Way cool.

Two thumbs up, way up, now back to my video games.",1301788800,,269,3.962962962962963
4234104,3,B003ZIQ5TO,"I bought this as a birthday present for my brother. I had seen it on PBS but he missed it.  We both love the music from Final Fantasy and on PBS there were quite a few Final Fantasy songs performed.  On the DVD there are no Final Fantasy songs performed at all.  The only Squaresoft song performed was the Chrono Cross theme (which is awesome)

The music that is here is excellent and well worth the purchase.  As for the missing Final Fantasy songs I blame Squaresoft because it turns out that they weren't allowed to include such music on this DVD. However there was a sticker on the front of the DVD (on the outside of the cellophane) which claimed that there was music from Final Fantasy on it.  Obviously they had planned on including such music and probably had to pull it some time in the production process.  The sticker must have been an oversight.

If you aren't specifically looking for Final Fantasy music then go ahead and purchase this, it's great music and a lot of fun.",1301184000,7,985,4.433333333333334
4234105,5,B003ZIQ5TO,"As a hardcore and experienced gamer, the concert was pure awesome with nostalgic parts. Check out the song list, if you do recognice or played some of the games in the list, you will love this concert.

The orchestra is amazingly pro, the songs and themes are played as you here them on the games, really cool; some of the remixes and covers are great too.

My favorite themes in the list are:
- Sonic
- MegaMan
- StarCraft 2
- Gow of War
- Zelda
- Mario
- Guitar Hero
- Castlevania
- Halo

A must.",1293062400,,498,4.11340206185567
