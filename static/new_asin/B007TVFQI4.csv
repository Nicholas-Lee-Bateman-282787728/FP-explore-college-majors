that perhaps the article from Life Magazine would have been included.",1420416000,3,183,4.75
8521854,5,B007TVFQI4,"If you are a Tasha Tudor fan, like me, you will do anything to see more images or videos of this amazing woman's life...even through the imagery of another person's artistic interpretation.

Finally able to see the works of Tasha's dolls in action, and a bit of her home life, told through an interesting fantasy tale.

This video now becomes a part of my loved and cherished collection to watch and to reminisce of a more gentle era.",1394755200,10,434,4.551282051282051
