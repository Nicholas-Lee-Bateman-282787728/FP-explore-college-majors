8310286,4,B001HZ30PE,"Paul Gilbert is an excellent teacher.  With his easy-going yet informative style, he walks you through most of the songs on Silence Followed by a Deafening Roar. I took away one star for not showing everything.  I saw some videos of John MacLaughlin using a guitar with a midi interface to provide the viewer with the actual notes being  played.  It requires a certain degree of precision in technique which I'm sure would be no problem for Paul Gilbert. However, for the parts of the songs which are provided, the DVD does a great job.",1277337600,,536,4.610526315789474
8310287,5,B001HZ30PE,"Paul Gilbert is back with another instructional dvd about his new album ""Silence Followed by a Deafening Roar"" which is a phenomenal follow-up to his previous all instrumental album ""Get Out of My Yard"". SDBADR DVD is similar to the GOMY one, except now Paul includes tablature! Now we don't have to keep pausing and rewinding to see where his huge hands are. The tabs are very detailed and even denote the up/down strokes of alternate picking. Included as well are backing tracks so once you have mastered the material, you can play them in context!

On to the meat of the DVD. You can't go wrong with Paul Gilbert. His approach to the DVD is selecting certain portions of his songs showcasing different techniques--so you don't leave any segment of DVD not having learned anything new! (Though I'd love if he included the complete tab to all of his songs). If you haven't heard already his teaching style is great; he's a down to earth, humorous guy who plays fast. Some people may be put off by the fact that they cannot play as fast as Paul on the first try, but I would argue that the technique is more valuable that just playing fast--that comes after years of practice! That said, this DVD isn't the place for beginners to start, but to build upon their technique once they have the basics down. After the normal run through of every song, Paul talks about phrasing, fast picking, legato, and arpeggios. The arpeggios section is particularly interesting as he shows how to break up chords in a totally new way! The only section I found rather disappointing was the phrasing--it's difficult to show it, but I've seen it done well before. And last is my favorite: the SHRED ANNEX! This is where Paul goes crazy and shows you one super fast lick in every key. If you good enough to play that fast, this will really give you a chance to expand your vocabulary.

As for the Extras in the DVD, there is footage of Paul performing in Seoul, Korea on the Spaceship One tour. While it's a nice bonus, it doesn't add anything extra to the DVD as a whole.

In conclusion, an excellent DVD and well worth the money! Get your hands on it ASAP!",1258761600,9,2137,4.516795865633075
8310288,5,B001HZ30PE,"As I said in previous reviews, Paul possesses a gift to be able teach shred on video the way may other players don't. Here he covers all the tunes from his CD SILENCED FOLLOWED BY A DEAFNINING ROAR and a SHRED ANNEX with great excercises. Backing tracks and tabs are included.

Genious which is what I will expect from maestro Pablo Gilberto, the shred master

RATING 10
