8229094,5,B000XPU4XU,"""Holiness to the Lord,  The House of the Lord"".  These words are engraved on the outside of every Temple that is built by  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Because the Mormons believe that each temple is actually the House of the Lord, extreme
care and the very finest quality are lavished on each Temple.  This DVD explains the 40 year process it took to build the awe inspiring Salt Lake Temple.  Many of the facts brought out and the historical photos presented I had never heard of or seen before.

As one of the most recognized landmarks of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Salt Lake Temple has a rich history filled with testimony and sacrifice. This compilation will build faith and increase respect for this incredible house of worship and monument of pioneer dedication.

What a beautiful building, unique in all the world.

I highly recommend bringing the historical beauty and spirit of the Salt Lake Temple into your home with this amazing DVD.",1379289600,,992,4.760233918128655
