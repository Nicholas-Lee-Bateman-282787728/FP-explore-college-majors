7981905,3,B00008DDSW,"Great night of music with Lemmy & the boys .
But this is a bootleg of the TV Broadcast .
They even left the TV Station watermark in upper left corner.

Still a great show & I'm glad to have it just not at these prices.",1231977600,,218,3.739130434782609
7981906,3,B00008DDSW,"This is Motorhead relatively early in their history, with the usual setlist of now-classics and frill-free rock 'n roll. There are a couple of obscure songs here but for the most part they're what you'd expect, with 'Stay Clean', 'Metropolis', and 'Bomber' figuring into the mix. The packaging is kind of wacky (it's all in Portuguese and 'Killed by Death' is misspelled on the cover), but the sound quality is good and video decent for being over twenty years old. The other reviewers didn't mention it, but my copy has an irritating glitch: after the first verse of 'Killed by Death' the DVD skips directly to the next track on the disc. I had to rewind quite a bit to get the rest of the song. Don't know if this plagues all of them or just my copy. Motorhead fans, feel free to purchase.",1145145600,2,791,4.5
7981907,5,B00008DDSW,"First of all - if you bought this not knowing it is Motorhead and are crying like a baby - don't worry because you are an drooling idiot anyhow!

For Motorhead fans this DVD gives you a look at the band right before their comeback via the Orgasmatron album and tour. The band is hot with the two guitarists and the DVD offers a good offering of both old and new material from that era. A must for true Motorhead fans.",1122940800,3,417,4.148148148148148
7981908,5,B00008DDSW,"I was so glad to come across this dvd ! Recorded right before the release of the legenary ""Orgasmatron"" album this as loud and brutal as you dare wish it!

Excellent quality,great set list lots of surprize appearences. If you are actually smart enough to appreciate Lemmy's work this is a must have for your collection!! I actually prefer this one over the newer ""Boneshaker"" dvd probably because it's less polished & more raw of a showing, but anyone with a brain knows that Motorhead doesn't ever really let ya down ! So quit cryin about the fact that it's not the band ""Birthday Party"" and witness some real rock n roll !! And for those without any real knowledge of the Motorhead library ""Ace of Spades"" in one of the featured tracks!

So support Lemmy dig deeper into the history of one of the most Important bands ever in music!!!!",1121817600,2,837,4.5364238410596025
7981909,1,B00008DDSW,"This DVD is a Spanish edition of Motorhead's 10th anniversary video dating back to 1985. This is fine for fans of Lemmy Kilmeister and Filthy Phil, but for those of you who are looking for the group The Birthday Party, Nick Cave's band from the same era, roughly, you would be better off looking elsewhere. Ditto Harold Pinter fans.",1050537600,13,332,4.6440677966101696
