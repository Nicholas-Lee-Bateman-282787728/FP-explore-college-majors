3156112,2,B0016FYGLC,"I agree with other reviewers. It looks like someone copied--I mean literally copied from a videocasette!  I didn't even realize Nagel was wearing his famous ""loud yellow suit"" until someone in the ""movie"" pointed it out, that's how muddy it is.  His suit looked brown to me. The voiceover actors are horrible, but even if the quality were decent, the editing, overly-loud music, pacing, it's all just a mess.  What a shame because the book it's taken from is my favorite of all time.  ""Would that thy knife were as sharp as your final no.""

""What rubbish!""",1334361600,,556,4.690721649484536

8262237,2,B0016FYGLC,"Agronomist, Johan Nagel (Rutger Hauer- BLADE RUNNER, THE HITCHER, BONE DADDY) arrives in a small, seaside town, where he becomes friends w/ a ""midget"" known as ""the midget"" (David Rappaport). The townsfolk seem hellbent on humiliating and otherwise tormenting the diminutive man, until Nagel sticks up for him. Nagel spends a lot of time walking around in the world's largest fur coat, checking out the local females. He can be kind and charitable, even though he's bitten a woman's hand and poisoned her dog! MYSTERIES is a strange, stunningly slow little film, somewhat typical for its era (1978). So slow is this film, as to appear to be running backward in many spots! For his part, Hauer is okay, somehow keeping his dignity throughout the interminable run time. His character is fairly interesting, in a bizarre, loony way. However, anyone expecting action, or any sort of story-line, at least one that leads somewhere, anywhere, had better look elsewhere! Punctuated by Rappaport's narration and sudden, inexplicable nudity, MYSTERIES has no real reason to exist, other than to offer Mr. Hauer an excuse to wander about in that grizzly bear coat...",1495411200,,1155,5.116402116402116
8262238,5,B0016FYGLC,"This is a classic. It's a fooler because of the date, you think it is a recent movie.  This is a very old movie brought back. There are major problems like inaccurate lipsync.  This is because they tried to turn SD iinto HD. That is why the film doesn't show as well. BUT, the story is a classic tale of human suffering, foibles, missteps, fears and attempts to be loved. Today, it would be called an epic or made into a series. If you can't watch, listen.  It is worth it.",1490227200,,473,4.175824175824176

Otherwise, no comment",1485907200,,137,4.230769230769231

8262242,2,B0016FYGLC,This period piece may have been one of the first films that either Rutger Hauer or Sylvia Krystal made. Worth watching only if you are a fan of either of these actors and interested in their evolution as performers.,1398470400,,215,4.538461538461538
8262243,3,B0016FYGLC,"It's never very clear why the traveler chose this area although the scenery is unique.  He seems to have money but no vocation. He is eventually integrated into local society.  He tries to acquire a wife with no results.  As with most European films, the main character ""thinks"" for long silent periods.",1383091200,,303,4.788461538461538
8262244,1,B0016FYGLC,"This was such a poor quality tv film that I was only able to watch 10 minutes of it before bailing out. Poor video, poor audio, poor script, poor acting.",1378339200,,153,4.133333333333334
8262245,1,B0016FYGLC,It moves at a snail's pace.  The film quality is very poor. The characters are uninteresting.  There is very little to like about this film.,1372118400,,140,4.56
8262246,1,B0016FYGLC,"Terrible transfer from VHS and hard to follow as all events are kinda somewhere in nowhere. I managed to find version on internet
and it had some soft core. The plot itself not impressive and imagination nowhere visible.",1362182400,,220,4.815789473684211
