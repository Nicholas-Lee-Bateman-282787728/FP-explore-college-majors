7841159,5,6303204074,"I enjoyed this movie immensely.  It had plenty of suspense and suspicion.  Jennifer Beals is absolutely awesome in this movie!  She played her part extremely well.  I will not give this movie away as long as I am living, because I will view it again.  My heart was throbbing with fear.  Just wonderfully put together.",1389657600,,317,4.672727272727273
