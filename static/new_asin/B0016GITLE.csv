8326142,5,B0016GITLE,"I love Sarah Menet's book ""There is No Death"" , and because of that I've wanted to learn more on how to prepare myself for a major incident. I believe she states herself, and her knowledge, exceptionally well in these videos. Especially since she was blind and had a sickness during the filming (as she mentions in the video). I'm grateful that she and Roger have devoted so much of their time and effort into making these kinds of videos and have participated in multiple seminars.
Now, it is kind of like a seminar, I wasn't prepared for that when I first bought the videos; but since then then, I've found myself watching them quite a few times.
I wish I had the privilege of meeting this amazing woman in person, and would like to thank her and Roger once again for making these videos. God Bless You! :)",1352419200,2,808,4.429530201342282
