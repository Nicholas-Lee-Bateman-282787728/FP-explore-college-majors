1193332,2,B000006GD0,"Except for the ""shocking"" premise, the movie doesn't have much to go on. Suprisingly slow moving considering the supposed drama of the corruption and the affair. Reeve, God bless his soul(pardon the pun)was handed a real doozy of a role. At times reverential to the Vatican,this character slides into a bizarre method-acted version of Gordon Gecko. How this person could ever exist is beyond me. Plus, I never really caught onto why the Monsignor is so ambitiously greedy anyway. Seems as if he would have gone to B-School instead of the clergy. Oh well, at least he's not chasing little boys...

Best scene: Nun discovers the awful truth during a ""all-hands"" Vatican visitation of the Pope.",1139875200,,691,4.956896551724138
1193333,4,B000006GD0,"It's amazing to me to read such widely opposing comments about this film. Mostly ignored, this film has perhaps a storyline that's rather difficult to believe, but many problems in Christiandom read more like fiction than fact in real life. Some Catholics may be offended by the film.

The movie starts out as a young Christopher Reeves, then a chaplin, has to make a choice as the Nazi troups close in, whether to open fire or not, as one of his soldiers dies of a bullet wound. Reeves ends up in the Vatican and through an unusual set of circumstances, relieves the church of its financial woes during WWII by selling Vatican supplies through the black market. He is befriended by a Cardinal, (Fernando Rey) whose performance in this film was perhaps the best of all the cast. Reeves ends up having an affair with the lovely Genevieve Bujold, their first encounter romantic, yet painful. The story continues with Reeves becoming involved in high finance as a bank manager for the Vatican, taking the blame for a multi-million dollar scandal brought on by a rogue mafia operative.

The film has been criticized for its fanciful plot, but at least we're not dealing with a child molestation, but a priest making very difficult choices while other priests are quick to condemn. It is a story of sin and redeption. Beautiful score by John Williams.",1110758400,25,1346,4.772532188841201
1193334,3,B000006GD0,"The plot of this movie is excellent and meaningful. It takes us behind the golden faades of the Vatican's walls and makes us take a plunge into its controversial policies and hipocritical acts. The only thing that ruins the  plot is a love story of the main character  la ""Torn Birds"",  which is meant as a ""reminder"" to us, that even priests have a  heart (well, we know already). For the rest, the movie is flawless, and  follows a very sinister path that at times crosses into true facts, which  unfortunately, did happen. Christopher Reeve plays convincingly. Absolutely  not recommended for those who ""believe"" in the Church. For all  the others, it is a worthy insight into the machineries of power and  corruption, even among the Holy Walls.

1193344,5,B000006GD0,"A huge procession of cardinals pays homage to the pope in St. Peter's in the Vatican. Seated among the holy men is cardinal Christopher Reeve, the movies' Superman, apparently figuring that one crimson cape is as good as another, when -- uh-oh! -- among the holy sisters filing into the cathedral is nun-to-be Genevieve Bujold, with whom he's just been burning up the sheets. She thought he was just a soldier, see, and now knowing his true vocation, she stops before him, thunderstruck, causing one hell of a bottleneck.

Later, the forbidden lovers meet in secret and Bujold seethes ""I was free with you and let you into my life, and you betrayed me! . . . It's not love you betrayed -- it's me: Clara! God can't forgive you, only I can forgive you. And I never will. Never!"" (And you've never heard anyone, anywhere pronounce ""Clara"" the way vinegary, smart Bujold does.) Peeling off her lingerie and nylons while shallow, glassy-eyed Reeve watches, Bujold explains, ""God gave me a strange gift. He made me attract love affairs that quickly become disasters. That's why I decided to become a nun. But, here I am, ready for another disaster."" Tossing back her head, our Earthquake survivor growls, ""I'll have some champagne.""

Well, disaster Bujold gets, in spades, so who can fault her for looking at Reeve as if she's choosing a capon at the poulterer? Sure, this epic from the filmmaking team that brought us Mommie Dearest apires to Godfather-like pronouncements on the Vatican's ties with the Mafia, but in its dirty little heart, Monsignor is just the ever-hilarious old potboiler about a sexy priest -- see Rain, Miss Sadie Thompson, The Sandpiper, Last Rites -- who gets hot under the collar for forbidden fruit. Reeve feels just guilty enough to gush, confession-style, to a priest, ""Father . . . I'm a priest. And I think I love her!"" Later, Bujold tells Reeve, after he's kissed her, ""I taste guilt there,"" a line that would have made a silent movie queen choke. You'll be jamming your ""FAST FORWARD"" and ""REWIND"" buttons to savor such laugh-out-loud stuff as Mafia creep Jason Miller growling, when he finds father Reeve and his Black Market pal Joe Cortese hung over from an orgy and surrounded by whores, ""You think you're king of the s***house!"" This is topped by holy eminence Fernando Rey responding to Reeve's disclosure of his sins by counseling, ""That happens."" No expense was spared, but nothing short of a miracle could have saved this holy mess which permanently parked the career build-up Reeve had been getting at the time, but as Bujold asks in one of our favorite lines, ""You think God was planning to waste a miracle on us?""",1422835200,,2654,4.77995642701525

Buy this DVD and be prepared to be entertained.  Kind of a blend of the Godfather and The Thorn Birds rolled into one.  Power...romance....corruption......its all here...Just like the Roman Catholic Church......powerful corrupt............. and full of intrigue.,1402876800,,577,5.586206896551724
1193358,4,B000006GD0,"""Monsignor"" was released when Christopher Reeve was at his peak: ""Superman"" had taken American by storm in the late 70's and into the early 80's. Unfortunately, Reeve was typecast into this role, with the exception of his appearance with Jane Seymour in ""Somewhere in Time."" This film, the story of Fr. (and later Monsignor) John Flaherty, a working class Irish Catholic from Brooklyn, is very effective in its demonstration of this priest's humanity. As a practicing Catholic, I can see where some would take issue with this film, primarily due to Flaherty's affair with Clara, a French postulant nun (Genvieve Bujold), while working for the Vatican. The financial issues the Church faces, and from which Flaherty arguably saves it from the brink of economic collapse due to WWII and other issues, are not particularly new material.

Effective supporting performances by Jason Miller and Genvieve Bujold help to prop up the film. In other reviews, I've constantly read criticisms of Reeve's acting in this picture. While he's no Laurence Olivier, his performance is not as stoic and lifeless as many critics suggest. In fact, his eyes often reveal his deep inner turmoil over his love for God and Holy Mother Church, his friends and fellow priests, and his forbidden love for Clara.

Since I was born in 1983, I am unaware of the publicity and marketing that surrounded this film upon its release. However, marketing is everything. Perhaps 20th Century Fox didn't know how to market ""Monsignor"" for fear of offending Catholics and other Christians, or perhaps because the director Frank Perry had engaged in high camp the year before with ""Mommie Dearest,"" an alleged biopic of Joan Crawford's domestic life. My one complaint is the film's editing. Were it not for a brief glimpse of Bujold's breasts, followed by a gunshot to the head of a black market profiteer later in the film, this picture could have easily played on television. The only revealing factors in its ""big-screen"" status are its caliber of actors and its lavish locations in and around Rome and the surrounding countryside. Frequently, the film fades to black and introduces new scenes with no introduction or character development. For example, the viewer is whisked immediately from Fr. Flaherty's ordination to the priesthood (a particularly touching scene) and a wedding party, to his chaplaincy in WWII. We are not given even the slightest background as to his development as a man or a priest, when presumably a couple of years had past.

All in all, I highly recommend ""Monsignor,"" but its audience will be small: namely, fans of now deceased Christopher Reeve, or viewers interested in Catholic Church history, culture, theology, or practices.",1397433600,2,2721,5.096412556053812

1193361,5,B000006GD0,"This film, set in the latter stages of World War II, has a dual plot in which its main character, Father John Flaherty, played by Christopher Reeve, walks a fine line between good and what many would call evil.  As a priest stationed in the Vatican, he uses his skills as a financial wizard to save the Church from bankruptcy resulting from the war.  He does this by expropriating products from the Vatican commissary, using his contacts with the Italian Mafia to sell them in Romes black market, and returning the Vaticans share of the profits to the Church.  He realizes that his actions are not only wrong, but also illegal; but rationalizes that he is doing it for the good of the Church.  His conscience is clear.

The plot thickens, however, when the erstwhile Father meets a young novitiate, studying to become a nun; removes the crosses, which signify him as a Chaplin in the US Army, from his uniform; and seduces her.  This, he finds, is not so easily rationalized.  And things go from bad to worse from there.

This is an excellent film with great acting, outstanding characterization and in-character dialog, and even better scenery and locale.  Due to its subject matter, however, it is also a difficult film to critique because it can easily be interpreted differently depending on the religious beliefs, or non-beliefs, of the particular viewer.  If the viewer happens to be anti-Catholic, he or she might easy accept this entirely fictional movie as fact and say I told you so; while, a Catholic, or a religiously inclined viewer, might just as easily be offended by the plot.  If you can set your personal beliefs aside, however, youll find this to be a fine, well-acted, and highly enjoyable film.",1390003200,2,1715,4.779661016949152

Now, after almost doubling my years, I have learned that even religion has to be run as a business. When profits fall, money has to be ""restored"" for the survival of the institution. With recent developments we have seen in the Roman Catholic Church, I decided to re-watch the film. It amazed me that my reaction was totally different from my first viewing. Obviously, my time of life is different, but I also realized that some of the mysterium tremendum I felt in my youth has also changed. As Rudolph Otto said, ""The feeling of it may at times come sweeping like a gentle tide pervading the mind with a tranquil mood of deepest worship."" I realized that my personal religion is not an institution. That realization is probably one of the most valuable lessons learned. I invite all Roman Catholics to view this film to get a better understanding of their faith, and hopefully a realization of their most precious possession--their deep inner faith in God.",1362355200,,1106,4.676923076923077

1193388,4,B000006GD0,"In reading the previous reviews of this film, I was astonished to find no mention of the fact that in it, a tale is told remarkably like the Banco Ambrosiano scandal involving Roberto Calvi, called ""God's Banker"" because of the close relationship with the Vatican that the Ambrosiano had.

In addition, there was an American prelate named Paul Marcinkus who ran the Vatican Bank from 1971 through 1989 and whose administration of the bank was investigated by the Organized Crime and Racketeering section of the Department of Justice.

Reeve's performance may be a bit wooden (although it's spectacularly animated compared to Tom Tryon's in Preminger's ""The Cardinal""), but the rest of the story, melodramatic as it may seem, is not THAT far from history.",1351987200,,754,5.07258064516129

1193401,5,B000006GD0,"When it comes to reviews and individual taste, it makes sense for there to be varying opinions; therefore, I can only offer my thoughts while trying to make them as unbiased as possible.  There has not, in my opinion, been a detailed prcis of the film that will adequately inform people of the storyline. It is my hope to provide one. However, it should be noted that I absolutely love this movie, and have ever since I first saw it around the age of 13.  I have literally worn my VHS copy out, and have been waiting with bated breath for it to be released on DVD. Having my bias regarding the film stated, let's begin the plot synopsis (WARNING!!!!! Spoiler alert!).

This movie always struck me as a ""darker"" version of the 1963 Academy-Award winning classic, The Cardinal; and has elements that will appeal to those who enjoyed Mario Puzo's, The Godfather. Though it is NOT based on a true story, the film does bring to light several issues that have the potential of offending those with Roman Catholic sensibilities, but - as I suggest - it doesn't have to. The story begins with the ordination of a young New York priest, Father John Flaherty (Reeve), who decides to act as an army chaplain during WWII.  Before leaving for the frontline, the audience learns that Flaherty is the favorite of a powerful New York bishop, and best friends with a man - Varese (Cortese) - married into a mafia family (more on that to follow). In the heat of battle, and after hearing the faithless comments of a dying soldier, Flaherty opens fire on an approaching German contingent, allowing a counter-attack to take place.  News of his actions and bravery reach Rome, along with recommendations from his supportive New York bishop, and Father Flaherty is called to the Vatican to exercise his skills in economics (we learn that his non-ecclesiastical degree was in finance) as a junior officer within the Vatican's financial department.  Along the way, Father Flaherty earns the trust and friendship of Cardinal-Secretary Santoni (Rey), ""the next important man after the Pope.""

Shortly after being appointed a mere junior advisor, Flaherty discovers that the war has plunged the Church into dire financial troubles, and he is also fortuitously reconnected in Rome with his childhood friend, Varese (recently decorated by the United States Army for outstanding service).  Varese, due to his mob affiliation in New York, has been appointed the underling of a powerful don in Italy.  His business is to oversee the running of mafia-based black-market operations in Rome.  Knowledge of this gives Flaherty an idea that will rescue the Church from its economic depression.  He proposes to Cardinal Santoni that he should be placed in-charge of the Vatican commissary so that he may be able to conduct black-market business deals, and by having sole control, Flaherty states that he will take complete blame should the actions be brought to light.  Flaherty encounters a problem with Don Appolini (Miller), however, who does not believe in conducting such business with the Church, whom he says is one of the three things he loves; but, the don quickly changes his mind when Flaherty tacitly tells him that he has Cardinal Santoni's support in the matter.  Flaherty's ultimate justification is that by entering the black-market, the Church will be able to divert funds from other criminal activities and use the money for good.

Interestingly enough, on the way back to Rome from his first meeting with Don Appolini, Flaherty and Varese (both in U.S. military attire) happen across a nun and her postulants in training who are caught in a storm.  One of the postulants, Clara (Bujold) - contrary to other reviews, she is NOT a nun yet - catches Flaherty's eye, although she does not know that he a priest (a fact he keeps from her).  The two set up a secret rendezvous, and develop a clandestine romance.  Clara explains that she is entering the Carmelite Order because of her failed relationships with men, but the superiors of her convent do not believe that she is willing to be fully committed to religious life due to this reason for worldly renunciation (turns out they are right). Flaherty continues trying to tell Clara that he is a priest, but fails at each attempt; and Clara explains that she is willing to leave Holy Orders for him.  However, should he not want her, she will return to France with her convent and take Holy Vows.  This acts as a subplot to the overarching storyline.

Flaherty discovers that the black-market scheme was only a temporary solution to the economic troubles facing the Vatican, and after WWII the Church is once again plunged into economic depression.  Deciding that he can once again fix the problem, Flaherty - with the blessing of Cardinal Santoni - is put in charge of restructuring the Vatican banking system, and is also elevated to the level of ""monsignor"" within the Church.  Basically, Flaherty uses the Vatican banks to house and invest the riches of the major mafia families in Italy: thereby putting it to good use while allowing the money to be laundered.  It is during this time, and during a special ceremony held by the Pope, that Clara learns Flaherty's true identity.  In my opinion, the best scene of the movie follows when Clara confronts Monsignor Flaherty in the beautiful Roman Church near where they met secretly.  Clara's seething hatred really comes across in Bugold's performance, and I applaud the scene.

Lastly, Flaherty is appointed a Prince of the Church (Cardinal), and has amassed great wealth as the Vatican's chief banker.  However, after his old friend Varese embezzles millions of dollars, his banking activities are called into question, and the College of Cardinals and the Pope deliberate on what to do with him. Before entering a retreat and leaving Vatican life for an unspecified amount of time, Flaherty - with Don Appolini's help - fixes the financial mishaps, thereby preventing the Church from being implicated in criminal activity.  Subsequently, Appolini hunts down and kills (executes? You choose which word fits best) Varese.  Later, the current Pope dies, and Cardinal Santoni is elected to the Throne of Saint Peter, and he recalls Flaherty from his seclusion to once again be his council.  Fin.

Hopefully this more detailed synopsis will allow the individual to better decide if he or she will be interested in this film.  It is, in my opinion, one of the best movies in circulation, and I encourage its viewing.",1341619200,8,6493,4.906764168190128

1193404,5,B000006GD0,"Christopher Reeve's is often blown off by critics is just a typecasted tragidy who never lived up to his full potential. Like Somewhere In Time this movie received harsh critisism when first released however unlike Somwhere In Time which eventually gained full respect. This film never did. Instead religious nuts bashed it. Not for it's bad taste like Godfather 3. But simply for it's alligations of corruption in the vadican. Something proved years later to be true. In the wake of many pedifile charges, this story isn't so far fetched. Religious nuts bash this as a religious film but it's not. It's a mafia/Gangster flick with a priest as a main charrecter and the vadican as the back drop.

This is great, not allotta gangster films actually take place in Italy. Let alone the vatican. Reeve's is great as ever. As we'll as his best friend Joseph ""Joe"" Cortese star of the underraited cult masterpeice Family Enforcer best known as Joe Pesci's first film. Cortese is very underrated. Equally as great as DeNiro & Pachino in their prime. It's sad Scorsese hired Pesci & Frank Vincent for Raging Bull but never hired Cortese. He shines hear as he does in many other films like Ruby by John Mackenzie & Rat Pack by Rob Cohen. People who have watched Family Enforcer and waiting for directors Cut from Grind House Releasings will most likely love this film too.

Another underrated genious in this film is the always intense Jason Miller who plays the Mafia Don & also plays a gangster in the Underrated Nickel Ride (Just released by Shout Factory) mostly known for The Ninth Configuration & The Exocist) in one of his best underrated roles as well.

Adolf Celi of ThunderBall, Fernando Rey of The French Connection & Leonard Cimino as the Pope of Q&A, Hide In Plain Sight, Honor Thy Father & Witness To The Mob.

Reeve's as many know also wanted to play Pat O'Brian's charrecter in an Angel's With Dirty Faces Remake in the 80's but bad press stopped it. I think it's great Reeve's got to be in a mini 2 hour epic where he ages old, hangs with Joe Cortese, works with Don Jason Miller, even romances nun Genevieve Bujold from Obsession. This film is a great Companion peice to Micheal Cimino's The Scilian directors cut. A Must see and finally on DVD.",1303257600,2,2254,4.670025188916877
1193405,4,B000006GD0,"I am one who agrees the movie is not only better but different than perceived by the critics. I don't think it is laughable. You can take it as a stylized metaphor or parable of Catholic reality. Quite remarkable how that which was too over-the-top to be taken seriously a while back now seems like an expected headline. Nobody thought it preposterous when Coppola put the Pope and Michael Corleone in the same bed.

However, the character played by Genevive Bujold..this is amazing. She seems the embodiment of the intrinsic conflict in Christianity/Catholicism with regard to matters of the flesh versus those of the ""spirit."" She is a victim of the dichotomy because she does not reject it as false on its face, as it should be rejected.

Her incipient 'hope' growing from within the otherwise desultory hook-up grows. She invests in it. It could be the healing of her torture.

But then the betrayal. Okay, perhaps on hearing this plot-point it seems all too clichd...but Bujold brings home the pain. The way the filmmakers set up and record the reveal of the betrayal and the intense, naked confrontation just afterwards, with rage-justified words and gesture...I know of no other such counter-attack of the wounded soul.

The film is worth it just for this scene.

One of the all-time great bad movies, a pricelessly funny piece of cheese about a priest who not only breaks his vows of celibacy but gets chummy with the Mafia.",1239321600,,255,4.521739130434782
1193407,3,B000006GD0,"Contrary to popular belief ... there are more than one kind of Catholic. There is the Roman Catholics who demand celibacy of clergy while the seven Eastern Rite (Byzantine Catholics) allows their priests to marry in Europe. Marriage was not a sacrament until sometime around 1000 AD when the Church added it to its list. Why shouldn't a priest be allowed to take holy orders and marriage vows at the same time? When Jesus taught he is referred to as Rabbi in the scripture, which during his day, was a term reserved only for marrried Jewish men. I am not stating anything about my views on theories that Christ was married but that .... if he was ... and if Eastern Catholics can ... why not those in Rome?

The late Christopher Reeve plays an ambitious American Priest and WW2 vet who arrives in the Vatican. He is placed in charge of financial dealings and ends up in illegal schemes with the Mafia, and breaking his vows to enter into an illicit union with a noviate. This isn't so far out and in 1982 when this film was released was far more controversial. The film could have had the kind of cinematic opulence as the Passion but it got flat with stereotypes about Catholics. Monsignor is a story about ambition in ""spiritual"" places and how one man's lust for recognition got uglier despit his frocks.",1174003200,2,1307,4.561702127659575

1193409,3,B000006GD0,"Just caught ""Monsignor"" on cable. It seemed to be well-paced in that it didn't drag for me as it did for another reviewer. The plus side is that it shows the worldly side of the Roman Church and how this church might get into financially ambiguous dealings with the best of intentions. The black-market business does seem farfetched; yet there's historical precedent: in the Middle Ages the pope was dealing with Jewish moneylenders while the official Church was condemning usury as a sin. Also, Chris Reeve's character represents a type based in reality, the priest who's rambunctious in his younger years, and even does some messing with women, but eventually gets himself into line. Genevieve Bujold is fairly credible as the novice--or postulant--who gets involved with a man--but to be seduced on the second meeting?! She loves him that much that soon? I fear she was an excuse to insert a disrobing scene into a leaden script. And why did they jeopardize their immortal souls with such a mournful fornication?

The film may be worth renting, but not buying.",1147824000,3,1063,4.93854748603352
1193410,3,B000006GD0,"I too, found the story to be very far-fetched, 'til I read an article in the Los Angeles Times concerning the American Cardinal that was in charge of the Vatican Bank concerning some 'slight' irregularities of one (financial) type or another.  Interesting timing?

My ultimate view of the movie is that it was a love story.  The love that a man had for his church and for his girl.  Never mind that the girl was a nun-in-training.

For me, the confrontation scene in the church just messed with my head - that is - I could actually 'feel' Monsignor Flaherty's agony.  Don't get me wrong, people in the theatre actually laughed, but there was nothing even remotely funny about 'being caught' like that, and the ramifications should have been nothing less than catastrophic for him.

For those who termed the movie Campy, Cheesy or whatever other adjectives you may choose to describe this movie, I say get yourself a copy and see for yourself.  Oh, and the acting was actually decent!  Three stars for the film!  R.I.P. Mr. & Mrs. Chris Reeve!!",1143417600,8,1043,4.681318681318682

Also, always tell the truth and be true to yourself because the lies you tell  eventually catches up with you, the truth will hurt the lives of others and will set you free.
Lastly, one can lose their integrity because of self will and not the will of God.
