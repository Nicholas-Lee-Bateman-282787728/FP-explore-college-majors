8383213,3,B002WK5B9G,"I was assigned to the 309th Special Operations Sqdn. at Phan Rang Air Base, Viet Nam as Flight Engineer on C-123K.
The DVD would have been better had it been narrated with actual sound recordings instead of the background music.

Hopefully, a new DVD on ""Ranch Hands"" ""Agent Orange"" spray missions and the C-123K missions flown out of Phan Rang Air Base from 1968 through 1970 would really show how tough these birds are.",1286668800,,421,4.6891891891891895
8383214,5,B002WK5B9G,"I flew as a Flight Engineer on UC-123K's (an upgraded version)in Vietnam.  This film was excellent.  Of course narration would have been nice, but they would have needed to find someone who really knew what they were talking about to explain what was going on.

I enjoyed it immensely.",1262995200,,285,4.775510204081633
