8303829,5,B001G4Z0PO,"The 2008 documentary `The Forgotten Woman' offers the audience a view of India that is neither spiritual, exotic, or inviting. It is hard to believe that a culture so rich in tradition and spiritually could be so callous and unconcerned when it comes to the welfare of widows. This is especially true when one considers the extremely important function played by the divine feminine within the Hindu faith.

Dilip and Deepa Mehta take the viewer on an unpleasant and eye opening journey through a contemporary India that has no place for widows. Women are cast out of their homes, deprived of their property and possessions, and ostracized from their families due to any number of reasons. Be it superstition, greed, or basic lack of human kindness for others, it is a human rights condition that has gone on for much too long.

This film explores the places these disenfranchised women gather, the temples where they chant for hour upon hour for a small cup of rice, or the streets where they congregate to beg from those who pass by. You'll also hear the opinion of the men on the street concerning the plight of the widow, comments that range from a resigned that's how it's always been attitude, to the arrogant and sickening men are like bees, ""women are like flowers"" comment. However maybe the most telling moment of all is when a man and wife relaxing in a park are asked their opinion concerning the treatment of widows. The man replies for both of them saying they have nothing to say, then displays a rather subtle but hostile attitude that lets his wife know that she should remain silent as well. Power through intimidation was captured on film for all to see. It kind of said it all for me.

Believe it or not all is not hopeless despair in this sobering film. I must say that I'm so impressed by many of the widows featured in the film. Their inner strength, positive attitude, and deep spirituality in the face of their life and death struggles is truly inspiring. There are also moments of gladness and glimpses of hope for the future explored by the Mehta's. Brave individuals are stepping forward and organizations are being formed that are slowly changing both the outer public policies and the inner collective consciousness that have allowed these inequities to go on for so long. Things are changing and hopefully will continue to do so until being a widow will no longer be considered a curse in India.",1304899200,,2426,4.7035294117647055
8303830,4,B001G4Z0PO,"The Forgotten Woman is a well presented peek into the world of India's millions of scorned widows.  A combination of superstition, lack of education and cultural antiquity comes together to result in one of the most terrible situations that any country claiming to be modern can condone.  It is sadly amazing that a country with such a rich and deep history of science and spirituality can allow this atrocious state of affairs to continue.  Watch this film and you will agree that something must be done.  The soundtrack is a quite beautiful and moving example of Classical Indian music with sitar and vocals.  (Can anyone tell me how to find the soundtrack?).  doc A",1239753600,,668,4.815789473684211
