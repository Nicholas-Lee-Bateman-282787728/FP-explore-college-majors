But they are so dull and boring -- it is painful to keep watching.
Finally I went to amazon.com and found out that I am not the only one who ""suffered"" from the dvd set. :)",1309305600,,260,4.019230769230769
1787028,2,B00006LPDA,"The condition of this used product was excellent -- my issue is with the product itself.  I thought I could use this as an educational supplement.  (I am a teacher.)  However, unless I want to be forcibly chased from my classroom, I will not be subjecting my students to any of the dvds.  There are certainly moments in each dvd that are engaging, but these are few.",1237593600,7,366,4.417910447761194
1787029,3,B00006LPDA,"The DVDs are okay.  Plenty of good information, but a dreadful narrator for most of the programs.  If you don't mind boring narration, these DVDs are okay.",1214611200,3,155,4.703703703703703
1787030,4,B00006LPDA,"My first DVDs or videos for that matter on Ancient Civilazations and i must say it was wonderful and really got me pumped up about Ancient history. It Cover great detail in to what was once there and how it looked and then how it it today and doesnt bore you for a second. Questar is really the Leader in these series. Worth every penny for the set. i wasn't really all that excited for Mexico or Egypt i was into Athens and rome and man this turned it around and i got reaklly interested in it so if your looking historical side of these stories then pick this up youll be happy ya did, no wonder why these tapes got so many awards.",1144713600,20,633,4.112903225806452

1787033,1,B00006LPDA,"I've watched many films about ancient civilizations and this is one of the dullest and most uninsightful I've ever watched. The set is titled ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS but as you watch the first 2 DVDs they are titled ""Great Cities of the Ancient World'. The first 4 DVDs basically just examine present ruins ( Rome, Pompeii, several Greek regions, Egyptian ruins and Mayan and Aztec Ruins).The ruins are discussed then computer graphics are used to reconstruct what they might have looked like in their full glory. If you decide to travel to these regions it might actually be very useful to take along and appreciate what the present day sight might have looked like in the past.
I found the Rome and Greek DVD very poor. The best one was the Mayan and Aztec DVD and offered more insight into the culture and history of these people. It was also more dramatic and offered some original perspective on the reason and history of sacrifice.
I would recommend a host of other titles over this set. As a series giving a general overview of many civilizations, Time Life's ""LOST CIVILIZATIONS"" is far superior.",1122163200,52,1102,4.774869109947644

1787041,2,B00006LPDA,I was hoping there would be more than just commentary.  The other DVD's I have purchased through Amazon seemed more interactive with the audience.  Unfortunately this collection did not grab my attention,1363564800,,203,5.3125

7972263,1,B00006LPDA,"Sadly there is no ""zero stars"" button. Episode one, is some nonsense that essentially chalks it up to aliens who manipulated our DNA. When the plausible location for Eden is narrowed down through guess work and supposition, the whole thing takes a turn with, ""But we can't go there and dig, because it's a bad place to be, politically. So all we have to go with is ancient Sumerian text, but we'll only consult one guy.""  Then the entire thing revolves around the research of one person, uncontested, without scientific peer review, or alternate translations considered. The guy even mentions the location in outer space he thinks the Sumerian gods are from. A location discovered through modern science; one the ancient Sumerians, could not possibly have known existed, or have viewed with the naked eye. It's Ancient Aliens by another name. Except not as good. And without that guy with the really cool hair.",1517529600,,910,4.909090909090909

The theories outlined in this program, make more sense of everything I've ever read on the subject, tying them in together, in such a way that is fascinating. For what it's worth, I've read dozens of books and watched many programs and documentaries over the years - just to add context to my above review.",1516838400,,446,4.385542168674699

7972266,5,B00006LPDA,"I am reviewing the Gaia production of a 2017 new series called ""Ancient Civilizations."" I think some of these other reviews are based on an older series of the same name . . . this is not that. A long review follows along with a short ""Bottomline"" at the bottom of this review.

What this is is one of my favorite shows on Gaia.  It brings together the great minds of today, many of whom are regulars on or have their own shows on Gaia, such as David W., Corey G., Gregg B., Anton P., Graham H. and so on.  There are scientific findings interwoven with spiritual, mystical, religious, historical and extra-dimensional insights.  It's a show for a certain audience at a certain time, and that is certainly not someone who wants to see the traditional, old-school version of the history of ancient civilizations acted out along with shots of real archaeological sites. (Though this show does have great video footage of these sites.)

What it does have are interviews with the great thinkers of today (who will certainly go down in history as great thinkers much to the chagrin of closed-minded scientists and historians), as they talk about the most progressive theories being re-discovered - quantum physics and string theory; rewriting history due to the recent discoveries of Gobekli Tepe, the Sphinx and pyramids worldwide; re-examing geological and climatological evidence to find explanations for these great structures;  electro-magnetic discoveries and sooo many more topics - and it's fun to connect the dots, see what overlaps and coincides, to form within one's mind a somewhat overarching 'theory' that is close to making sense of all these things that make us wonder...

What's most important: 1) they use scientific facts and data to propose and support their points AND 2) they're open to other ideas and explanations.  What's funny, is that that's what science is about, and yet traditional science tends to eschew new knowledge.  ""The world is flat,"" they said in the past.  ""The sun goes around the earth,"" they said.  ""This is new age goofy hippie nonsense,"" they might say now.  And in the near future, nearer I hope, these ideas will be as established as 'the world is round and it revolves around the sun'.

BOTTOMLINE:  This is a 30 or so minute show with interviews of today's most cutting edge interdisciplinary theorists.  They use data, facts, historical and religious evidence to shine new light on our oldest ancient civilizations, on our present place in the galaxy and the universe, and on our future as the human race.  If you have an open and curious mind, and are willing to consider the fact that there is so much we do not know about ourselves and our planet, but you are excited to consider the possibilities and maybe rediscover the knowledge we've lost, then this is for you.",1510617600,,2813,4.84133611691023
