8454667,5,B0052XU4CO,"The Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) joined the North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in recognizing September as ""National Menopause Awareness Month."" In support of the same goal, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated October 18 as ""World Menopause Day.""

In conjunction with National Menopause Awareness Month and anticipation of World Menopause Day, Truemind (""an innovative home video entertainment label dedicated to healthy living, environmental wellness and personal development"") released ""Managing Menopause Naturally.""

Beginnning with statistics regarding the number of women entering menopause--think ""baby-boomers""--and continuing with information on what menopause really is (and what it isn't), ""Managing Menopause Naturally"" is an informative discussion of treatment options available for women entering (or suffering from) menopause, as well as osteoporosis prevention.

Experts in the field of women's health (doctors, midwives, herbalists, nutritionists, educators, writers) define terms associated with menopause and describe its stages. Although American doctors have traditionally treated menopause as an estrogen deficiency disease, ""Managing Menopause Naturally"" focuses on more natural treatment alternatives, stressing that differences in the ways women experience menopause are influenced by differences in culture and diet.

Managing Menopause Naturally offers suggestions for dealing with the symptoms of menopause, from hot flashes to dryness, and discusses hormone-replacement therapy and bio-identical hormones. A variety of herbs are discussed, including how herbs work in the body and on-going research into their effects and efficacy.

Because viewers don't need to watch the video all the way through in one sitting, ""Managing Menopause Naturally"" is like a comprehensive lecture (or lecture series) that can be experienced in smaller chunks of time by watching individual chapters. It is also an excellent choice for women's groups and would be an appropriate adjunct to a workshop.

For those who don't know what menopause is exactly or have questions about symptoms, treatment, and preparing for menopause, ""Managing Menopause Naturally"" offers the answers they seek.",1315785600,4,2228,6.194174757281553
