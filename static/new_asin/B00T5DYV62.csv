8700374,5,B00T5DYV62,"This is an awesome series that reminds of a mix between concepts that were later used in Madoka Magica and previously used in Evangelion. The way each of the pilots are fleshed out makes you care more (or less) about certain characters and really broadens the scope and sincerity of the story. 14 children are chosen to pilot the robot they name Zearth, thinking they are playing a game, and similar to Madoka Magica, their contract with the mech has a far higher price then they were expecting .If you love great music, great character work, and a tragic, yet endearing story I really suggest watching this. In fact, We are lucky to have this anime licensed considering this came out in 2007 in Japan and only just now being released in the West.",1427673600,4,747,4.582089552238806
