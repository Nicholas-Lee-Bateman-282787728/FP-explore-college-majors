4962316,5,B0066E6QGG,What a simple happy world Andy Hardy lived in and the stories remind me of the family ones on TV in the fifties.  Delightful and filled with life lessons even for today. We were pleased to see our grandkids have enjoyed them.,1333238400,6,225,4.357142857142857

4962318,5,B0066E6QGG,This set is a must have for Andy Hardy movie fans. I can't wait for Volume 2 to come out. A quality DVD product that is well worth the price.,1327795200,4,141,3.7333333333333334
4962319,5,B0066E6QGG,all of the films are good quality so the reproduction is great. I am glad this was made available. I hope the remainder of the films are made available as well,1327190400,10,159,4.161290322580645
4962320,4,B0066E6QGG,"There are 16 Andy Hardy films - 15 in the original series and a follow-up film made in the 50's.  Love Finds Andy Hardy was previously released as part of a Judy Garland box set and Love Laughs at Andy Hardy is available through public domain.  That leaves 14 films. This set has six films but not the first six films!

Most films take place in the all American town of Carvel and center around the Hardy family.  The father is the town Judge James Hardy (Lewis Stone)with mother Emily Hardy (Fay Holden), son Andy Hardy (Rooney), sister Marian (Cecilia Parker) and maiden Aunt Millie (Sara Haden).  Andy was always chasing Polly Benedict (Ann Rutherford) and was being chased by the younger neighbor girl Besty Booth (Garland).

The first film in the set is the second film in the series - You're Only Young Once (78 minutes) should be called the Hardys on Vacation.  And on vacation in Catalina, Andy falls for a socialite and Marian falls for a married man.

Second up is Out West with the Hardys (84 minutes) fifth in th series. The Judge takes the family out west to help an old friend save the ranch.

Next is the eigth film in the series Judge Hardy and Son (90 minutes). The Judge asks Andy to help him find the daughter of an immigrant couple that are about to lose their home.  Also, Andy tries to win the school essay contest.

Andy Hardy Meets Debutante (88 minutes) - ninth in the series.  The Judge takes the family to NYC on business and Micky falls for a debutante and finds out the rich life is for the rich. Judy Garland makes a second appearance as Betsy Booth, daughter of a Broadway star.

Andy Hardy's Private Secretary (101 minutes) - number 10.  Its graduation time and Andy lets it get to his head.  He ""hires"" a secretary (Kathryn Grayson in her first film role) and this of course causes problems with girlfriend Polly.  One thing Andy forgets he still has to pass his classes especially Aunt Millie's English class.  The girls pull together and help Andy pass his finals.

Life Begins for Andy Hardy (101 minutes) - number 11.  Now that Andy has graduated, he decides to conquer the world - well New York.  When he runs into trouble its Bestsy to the rescue (Judy in her final appearance.)

The good news is that they are finally releasing these films the bad news is that it is a barebones release.  Expect no extra features.  The only chapter breaks are the standard every ten minutes.  So my major complaint is that why not release all 16 films at once.  Also, since most films run about 100 minutes, why not double feature them on 8 discs?  WB vault collection is this basic treatment of films and they charge a premium price.  WB either give a quality treatment to these films or offer at a discount.

The film series is five stars but the treatment is 1 star.",1325980800,72,2793,4.466403162055336

Every show presents at least one moral dilemma to be dealt with and the values back then clearly are not present in America today. Makes you wish we could go back and fix what we screwed up. This is a great series of fun, clean and actually humorous movies that everyone will enjoy watching regardless of how old you are.

The up and down daily life of the All-American Hardy family is fun to watch with a great cast of actors who played their rolls with perfection.  The popularity of this series would lead to several similar family television series beginning in the 1950's.

The multiple disc sets I have purchased from the Warner Brothers Archives Collections have been in good condition and played well with a good picture and sound.

4962438,5,B0066E6QGG,"The fifteen original Hardy family movies are real gems in MGM's crown from the late 1930's through the World War II years (I'll get to the 16th don't worry). Originally planned as a ""B"" movie and not a series 'A Family Affair' was the surprise hit of 1937 and caught L.B. Mayer completely off guard with it's huge success. So much so that theater owners were sending him plenty of telegrams clamoring for more Hardy family movies...especially that brash teen Andy Hardy!. Mayer knew potential when he saw it and of course he ordered more pronto...another one for 1937...three more each for 1938 and 1939..and then periodically through 1946. Of the original cast only Mickey Rooney and Sara Haden as Aunt Milly returned and all the other roles were re-cast.

America fell in love with the Hardy family as it has no other since and the small town of Carvel became the center of America's small town existence with the life, loves and travails of Andy Hardy and his parents and sisters and neighbors. Lewis Stone came to embody Judge Hardy a little more nobly than Lionel Barrymore had originally played him in my opinion and acted as the anchor (ably supported by Fay Holden as Mrs. Hardy) as solidly embedded in Americana as Walt Disney's later family features ever were (who can forget he and Andy's 'mad to mad' conversations???. Not to forget Cecelia Parker as Andy's sister Marian and Ann Rutherford (who died in 2012 at 94) as Andy's long time sweetheart Polly Benedict. Later another Andy admirer named Betsy Booth (the granddaughter of the Hardy's next door neighbor) joins the whole troupe and falls hopelessly for Andy as well (played by the lady most associated with Mickey Rooney in film - the late great Judy Garland and their scenes are terrific in the Hardy series).

Thus America's affair with the Hardy family spanned almost ten tumultuous years (including the WWII years). Love Laughs At Andy Hardy was the final in the original series in 1946 and then a dozen years later when MGM had fallen on hard times and was desperately trying to recreate some of its former glory came the 16th and last Hardy family film 'Andy Hardy Goes Home' which found Mickey Rooney returning to Carvel with all the original family members gathering sans Lewis Stone who had passed away in 1952. It's a poignant send off to the series tho Stone's absence is felt acutely throughout and ultimately it failed to revive the series but is fondly remembered by fans for providing some sense of closure.

The movies focused mainly on Andy Hardy's High School, College and beginning of adulthood years with plenty of side plots for Judge Hardy and the family reflecting the modern concerns of small town Americans of the era. Evenly balanced between drama and comedy throughout they are wonderfully entertaining even today and imagine my surprise when my 16 year old granddaughter and 19 year old grandson sat down with me a while back and watched 'A Family Affair' and loved it!! We're moving on to the rest.

Recently Warner Brothers (who acquired the rights to the MGM library) have finally released all 16 movies on two sets (single sided dvds for those curious). While not meticulously restored they are in fine shape for films from the 30's and 40's and for the first time since they were released provide access to the whole series in order (tho do your homework because they are not in order in the sets - but you can google the order and release years in 5 minutes). The Andy Hardy Film Collection Volumes 1 & 2. Volume 1 has six movies on six discs and Volume 2 has ten movies on five discs (don't ask why...just be grateful that they're finally available!).

I might add that I paid for these and did not receive them through Vine for those who accost me with 'are vine reviews honest since you get the merchandise for free!' never realizing how that impugns my honesty in the question itself. Amazon is offering the two sets at very reasonable prices (cheaper than the WB Shop I can tell you!) and if you want to relive a simpler time with values that should be taught in all times then these movies are for you. Many young MGM stars of the time that went on to bigger and better parts and movies and stardom are cycled through these films and you'll always be surprised by who shows up. It's entertainment pure and simple.

Trust me on this one. I know my movies.",1375574400,3,4363,4.652399481193256

Yes, it would be nice to have ""extras"" but these days it's getting hard just to find decent family movies that are actually funny.  These are movies that really make you laugh out loud.

4962443,4,B0066E6QGG,"Received this for Christmas because I am a huge fan of serialized movies of the late '30's and early to mid '40's. The Hardy Family series was among the most popular of the genre and made household names of Judge James K. Hardy (the venerable character actor Lewis Stone), Mrs. Emily Hardy (Fay Holden), only son Andrew (the comic foil played by juvenile lead Mickey Rooney), daughter Marian (ingenue Cecelia Holden), and the old maid schoolteacher aunt Millie Forrest (Sara Haden). Thrown into the mix at varying times within the films are Andy's primary love interest Polly Benedict (Ann Rutherford). Depending upon which movie you watch, you may run into a variety of up and coming actors such as Judy Garland, Dennis O'Keefe, Donna Reed, Diana Lewis, Kathryn Grayson, and Esther Williams.
This set includes the following installments of the series:

You're Only Young Once takes the Hardys out of their element to Catalina Island where Andy falls for a society girl and Marian gets involved with a married man. This was the second installment of the series.

Out West with the Hardys again relocates the Hardys to the the west where the Hardys try to aid the judge's frind from losing his ranch. This was the fifth installment of the series.

Judge Hardy and Son finds the Hardys back at home in Carvel. Andy is dealing with his usual financial problems and tries to help his father locate the well heeled daughter of poor family about to lose their home and Andy tries to ghost write an essay to win a cash prize with hilarious results. This was the Hardys eighth film adventure.

Andy Hardy Meets Debutante finds the family out of Carvel and in New York City. Andy goes crazy for big city life and one very popular debutante. Judy Garland makes an appearance as Betsy Booth, the grandaughter of their Carvel neighbor and the daughter of a prominent Broadway actress. This is the ninth in the series.

Andy Hardy's Private Secretary finds Andy ready to graduate from Carvel High. In his exuberance, he lets his grades slip and he hires a secretary played by a very young and unknown Kathryn Grayson. Graduation nearly evades Andy as he struggles to pass Aunt Millie's English class with Polly Benedict's and his secretary's help. Again, Andy gets a wake-up call, but will it slap some maturity into him? his is the tenth film in the series.

Life Begins for Andy Hardy finds Andy having just graduated before he presumably heads off to his father's lma mater Wainright. Andy again takes on NYC and gets into trouble. He is rescued again by faithful Betsy Booth (Judy Garland) in her last appearance in the Hardy series. This is the eleventh installment in the series.

This set is typical of the 'on demand' sets from the Warner Archive. No special features or chapters and stops every ten minutes. Ideally this set is for fans of the genre. While the production values aren't wonderful, the big plus is that they came out of MGM which gives them a more finished look and maintains a higher level of continuity. The Hardy series was a successful franchise which showcased a lot of their new talent who went on to bigger and better productions. The only odd thing about this set is how few of the films are set at home.",1356480000,3,3223,4.703900709219858

Gory murder themes. These story line are simple from a much simpler time. I would love
To see the entire series of Andy Hardy films on DVD!",1356220800,2,217,4.190476190476191
4962445,3,B0066E6QGG,"These are from the Warner Archive Collection; the discs are made on demand and do not contain special features that would be rich in this collection.  I grew up with the movies in the Warner Archive Collection which makes me old; when you are old your ears don't work well.  The Warner Archive Collection does not have subtitles; it reduces their value to someone with ears like mine and something you should be aware of before purchase.  I am old and can't wait for them to come out on Blu-Ray, so will watch with earphones, but I can't give the discs better than three stars.",1355443200,10,577,4.476190476190476
4962446,5,B0066E6QGG,"It is absolutely wonderful to have all these Andy Hardy movies. This is about as clean, family-oriented entertainment as you can get.

Like other reviewers, though, I do wish the movies in this collection started with the very first, and followed in the order they were made.

Hopefully, the rest of the Andy Hardy movies will soon be available in a volume 2 (&3) very soon. I know I sure will buy them!",1355270400,,403,4.506849315068493

I love this series and since it was about a year ago Volume 1 was released I had hoped for a Volume 2 release this december. Still, he who waits...",1353283200,3,345,4.164179104477612
4962449,5,B0066E6QGG,"I've been waiting a long time for an Andy Hardy dvd set. I literally grew up watching these. Sunday mornings. :)
 Dare i say the word wholesome in this day and age? That's what these are. They're heartwarming, fun, funny , touching and some of what i consider the best movies ever made. You're quickly reminded why Mickey Rooney is a show biz legend.
 It's true that the films selected are not in order. While that would have been nice, i'm just happy they're available at all.
 I recommend this for people of all ages. If you want movies that make you straight up feel good, spend time with the Hardy family. You'll never forget them.",1349827200,11,635,4.456896551724138

4962452,5,B0066E6QGG,"For several years I had tried to find the Andy Hardy movies on DVD--so when I saw this boxed set I was ecstatic! In my opinion, these are Mickey Rooney's best work. As judge Hardy's son, Andy is always getting into some kind of scrape which sets the stage for the life lesson of the film to be learned. Judge Hardy always listens to Andy when he requests a ""man to man"" talk, and with great wisdom helps him work through the problem. Even though there is a definite lesson to be learned, the comedy is simply wonderful. Whether Andy is having trouble with his ""love life"" or trying to keep his jallopy running and all in one piece, these movies are great family entertainment to watch over and over. I can't wait for Volume 2!!",1334016000,12,727,4.352941176470588
