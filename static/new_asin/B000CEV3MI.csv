2460321,4,B000CEV3MI,"To be honest, I'd barely even heard of this show before I bought the series on DVD.  The thing is, I'm a huge fan of the movie trilogy ""Poltergeist.""  So, seeing this at the store - with the same lettering/script as the movies - I thought, hey this must be somewhat related.  It wasn't....or at least nothing beyond dealing with the supernatural.  The funny thing was - this series actually drew me in...it took a couple of episodes but it actually really caught my attention.  The character development was very good - and I felt compelled to keep watching within a matter of days.  Many of the episodes were actually very freaky for television show horror - a pleasant surprise too.  Anyways, the point is, I unexpectedly found a show in which I now care about the characters and can't wait to see what happens in future seasons - and it was done all on accident.  I will definitely buy the second season if and when it is released.",1144713600,11,934,4.485207100591716

However, tonight I was at walmart, and my eye caught a glimpse of the DVD set for only 24.96! Ofcourse I purchased it without a second thought;no matter what the price I was going to buy it, and I'm thrilled that one of my favorite scifi shows is now part of my DVD collection. Like everyone else, I too hope and pray the other seasons will come out shortly. If you are a big fan of PTL, then this DVD set is a must have...also I recommend the soundtrack on CD.",1140739200,14,564,4.09009009009009
2460324,5,B000CEV3MI,"I am pleased beyond words that Poltergeist: the Legacy has finally found its way onto DVD.  This collection records all 21 episodes from the first season in beautiful format, with language and subtitle options.  There are no extra features (like commentaries or scene selections), except for Sci Fi and horror previews, but the episodes stand for themselvs.  Well acted with complex characterizations that make you really *care* about the people you're watching, and excellect special effects to complement and enhance the intriguing plots.  This remarkable series has been neglected for too long; I'm extremely relieved that this has been released, and only hope the remaining seasons will soon follow!",1139961600,55,703,5.422018348623853

2460342,5,B000CEV3MI,"PTL is an amazingly well-written and well-directed series which has a strong supernatural theme. The series covers various aspects of the supernatural and explores the many different creatures of darkness such as the incubus, restless spirits, Irish faeries, voodoo magic and many more. The series, a Canadian TV production ran from 1996 to 1999. I remember staying up to watch this on television even though I had an early workday the following day, it was that addictive and compelling.

The other members of the SFLH are ex-Navy Seal, Nick Boyle (Martin Cummins), researcher Alex Moreau (Robbi Chong), Father Philip Callaghan (Patrick Fitzgrerald), psychiatrist Dr. Rachel Corrigan (Helen Shaver), and Rachel's young daughter Kat Corrigan (Alexandra Purvis) who has latent psychic powers (not an official member of the Legacy but is involved in many of the story arcs in the series.

2460356,5,B000CEV3MI,"Very strange & interesting show that reminds a bit of Ghost Whisperer, Buffy & The Librarian films.

The pilot ep is actually pretty sexually graphic, with Helen Shaver being raped by a possessed man. There's bare breasts and thighs, but that's as far as it goes. Was this originally on cable, like Bladeru-erum-Total Recall 2070? Um-heeh!

MANY OF US HAVE PURCHASED SEASON ONE EXPECTING SEASON 2,3,4, TO FOLLOW IN A REASONABLE TIME PERIOD. THIS IS NOT HAPPENING. THE POWERS TO BE DID THE SAME THING WITH THE MURPHY BROWN COMEDY SERIES, PUT SEASON ONE OUT AND THEN LEFT US HANGING. BEING THE COLLECTOR I AM, I DON'T WANT JUST THE FIRST SEASON. I THINK IT IS UNDERHANDED AND BAD BUSINESS THAT THE PRODUCERS OF THIS DVD SET DID'NT INFORM THE PUBLIC IF THEY DID'NT INTEND ON PUBLISHING THE REST OF THE SERIES, OR AT LEAST NOT IN OUR LIFE TIME.

2460374,4,B000CEV3MI,"This is a fun, entertaining paranormal series. The show covers a full range of topics from witchcraft and voodoo to ghosts, mummies and a lost colony; enough diversity to keep it interesting. Those viewers who purchase a series called ""Poltergeist - The Legacy""...and then over analyze the writing and special effects should probably stick to documentaries. Personally, I'm looking forward to a second season of fun entertainment.",1203638400,2,430,5.432835820895522
2460375,4,B000CEV3MI,"Okay, it's a flawed classic, but Poltergeist the Legacy is a fun show with a lively ensemble cast.
It suffered from comparisons with it's peers, particularly The X files and Buffy, since it owes more to Hammer and Universal Horror then anything more ""edgy"" (at least it doesn't suffer from the pretty boy syndrome that afflicts Supernatural). What I really want to see now is the rest of the seasons get an outing on DVD as soon as possible.",1201737600,6,441,4.594936708860759

2460387,1,B000CEV3MI,"I have to agree with the minority voices. I rented the series first from Netflix and watched all of them to see if they would improve. They didn't. The actors are competent but the directing, writing and editing are pretty mediocre at best. The pilot/first episode was so bad I actually laughed during some of the intense moments. I also found myself fastforwarding to get through some of the unnecessary stuff. The stories tend to be cliche especially the ghost stories. If the writers did any serious research it is hard to tell because the plots are so typical and boring. I actually find Kolchak alot better. Also check out The Omega Factor. They are a little dated but I found them to be much better regarding the writing, acting and directing.",1200096000,6,749,4.681818181818182
2460388,5,B000CEV3MI,"Ah, P:tL. A highly underrated and overlooked show. While at times the actors were directed above the top, and there is a certain feeling of melodrama to be sure, the cast is unquestionably talented and its members are a pleasure to watch. The main theme music is truly delicious, the plots are intriguing and create their own feel of history coming back to haunt us, and the characters are quite engaging and well-drawn. One of the main draws to watch the next episode, in fact, is to see what will happen to those people in their peculiar little society. How does a young priest conquer the lusts which keep coming back to haunt him? How does a former soldier deal with emotions long suppressed within him? How does a mother protect her child in the face of dangers she never wanted to know existed? How does a woman, and a scholar, turn book knowledge into real-life strength? How does a son cope with his father's dark legacy? And what roles do these people all play in each others' lives? The answer is often more intriguing than you would guess. How do these remarkable individuals, skeptics and believers alike, deal with knowing the truth about what lives in the darkness and haunts humankind?

However, later seasons of P:tL were tighter, and much more worth the craving for resurrection via DVD. Since the show is no longer really on television, MGM would do quite well to bring us new seasons of this cult classic. I would gladly buy them all--and so would many people who witnessed Martin Cummins' talent on Dark Angel. I swear, he's easily as good on this show as that one--and this time, he's playing a good guy, if a troubled one. Even better, like all the male characters on the show, he has a sensitive, human side without ever looking weak or whiny. P:tL doesn't flinch away from showing the flaws in its characters, and that's one of the reasons I like it so much.

If you're a fan of the supernatural, or spooky television in general, I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a look.",1196467200,28,1998,4.609550561797753
2460389,4,B000CEV3MI,"Well, season one is a mixed bag if you are just getting into this series, its really just a good background set. Things got better in Season two and picked up all the way to the end of the series. Yet season one for all its great stand alone episodes, doesn't stand up to the other seasons as well.  Its still worth the buy if you like paranormal tv shows, and if you're hemming and hawing...wait till season two is out and pick up both, and you can see the difference and have the background information.",1187654400,7,505,4.260416666666667

2460394,4,B000CEV3MI,"I've read the other reviews.  I also watched the show.  I never considerned PTL to be a horror show.  I considered a thinking man's paranomral show.  There was a problem, and the Legacy found a solution or at least tried to lessen the effect of the problem.

I could watch the show and sleep at night, which is more than I can say aobut modern horror movies, and I grew up with the old classics and atched Hammer horror movies. Personally, I don't like today's modern horror shows.  For that sort of thing, I read the daily newspaper and watch CNN.  What one thinks of a tv series and/or movies depend on one's personal likes and dislikes.

  I always thought the producers did well with the show, considering the original movies plots.  They came up with a plot line which was sustainable throughout an indefinite run tv series.  Which like Friday the thirteenth - the series  could not continue the movie set up.  As for

effects and writing, remember this show was done one episode a month on showtime,like the much lauded Sopranos.",1177804800,6,1035,4.579234972677596
2460395,1,B000CEV3MI,"(Warning, rent this series first to see if you really like it unless you have watched it previously and know that you do)! I wasn't just disappointed after my first viewing of Season 1 of the Legacy; I was looking for a means of disposing of the DVD set!!  I usually feel I can rely on a consensus of opinion of Amazon viewers and ordered the Legacy (sight unseen) after reading the reviews of other customers.  I know now that when it comes to certain subjects I can not go with the flow.  I am a long time fan of science fiction and horror going back to Forbidden Planet and the old Universal horror movies (Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolf Man, etc.). I also loved the motion picture POLTERGEIST as well as all of the newer horror movies (HELLRAISER, BUTTERFLY EFFECT and DEAD SILENCE).

I am not a ""high brow"" person by rule and I have tried adapting to the times making a point of seeing and usually enjoy almost every new horror movie for what it is worth.  This series was embarrassing to watch and I can't believe any self respecting horror movie fan would rate it highly.  The special effects were third rate at best, the script is terrible, the characters are pathetic and after five minutes I didn't care what happened to the entire cast.  My son walked out after a few minutes and he is a Steven King fan. I had to agree with him and actually felt a bit silly when I continued watching hoping it would improve. The only thing I can say good about this product is that the price was right for so large a collection of episodes.

I am amazed to see that only 3 out of 36 readers thought that my review was useful.  I am even more amazed to see that 36 people were moved to vote in any way on what I consider to be my least important review (only approached by the negative responses I received on DOGMA). POLTERGEIST doesn't warrant my raving about another film conspiracy! Does it?",1164067200,11,1891,4.364672364672365
2460396,5,B000CEV3MI,"The Legacy series was wonderful horror TV - it had high production values with great sets and costumes - first class special effects - mostly good acting and actors and way above average scripts. Each week the secret society would band together to either destroy some great evil or to survive an attack on them by some great evil. Demons - Ghosts - Devils - Jinn - and much more. This was better than other series I also watched such as ""Friday the 13 the series [cursed antiques storyline], and the current Supernatural series.

2460397,1,B000CEV3MI,"Poltegeist is the worst DVD set that I ever purchased. The plots are the most ridiculous and amateurish that I have ever encountered. Characters have no clear delineation, they hover over any terrain that the writers hoist on them. Contradictions and sheer lunacy are admitted into the script if the story demands it. Characters who are sceptical one minute, suddenly swing wildly into occult belief full of knowledge of mystical arcana. The actors try to make this schmaltz work, however, at times their faces, confused at the blatant absurdity of the script, collapse into pseudo profound baffoonery. Ludicrous coincidences dominate the plot to such an extent that you cannot even expel didainful laughter. This show is not even a ""turkey"" because the sheer stupidity of the script elicits revulsion of such a sharp quality that you can only dream of smashing the DVD's with a hammer to eleviate the loathing that overwhelms your mind while wasting your life watching this dross. This show is so awful, I couldn't give it away as a present for the justified fear that the recipient would promptly end our dear friendship due to the insult of unloading this manure to their dwelling. Ugh! Avoid this show like the pox.",1159142400,8,1219,4.951219512195122
2460398,5,B000CEV3MI,"I have long awaited this series to be released and am disappointed that only season 1 is out so far. Can't wait for the other seasons to be released. This was one of those ground breaking shows that had mystery, action, suspense and horror all rolled into one. I liked all the characters and appreciated that the show gave each their own episodes and didn't concentrate on just the leader as so many other series with multiple characters do. The characters all had strengths and weaknesses as people in real life do and the show made good use of this.

The DVD quality was excellent and the sound very good at least on the limited equipment I had available while watching it in Afghanistan. Can't wait to get it home and watch it on a full surround sound setup. If you're looking for a series that shows real life people in extrodinary situations then this would be  one you should check out and add to your collection.",1156636800,11,919,4.497005988023952
2460399,5,B000CEV3MI,"This show was amazing- deep characters and intriguing plotlines. This show was great when it first aired, and still holds up well over time. Can't wait for Season 2 !!!!",1156118400,9,169,4.666666666666667
2460400,5,B000CEV3MI,"Just like I said with the new Outer Limits season review, its about damn time!!! I thought it took waaaayyyy tooooo long for this to get released... but now its finally here! I got this the day it came out, back in Feb. I LOVE every episode of season 1 & Im looking forward to MGM releasing season 2 sooner that later... by this, I mean hopefully we will see season 2 before sometime LATE next year... yea, for whatever reason, they only want to release just 1 season of these great shows a year, which is in my opinion, bulls@#t!!! Com'n MGM, get on the ball already & get these great shows out on DVD ASAP!!!!!!!!!",1154649600,4,616,4.273504273504273
2460401,5,B000CEV3MI,"I have waited, like many others for this series to be released on DVD. I even wrote many emails to MGM with my concerns and wishes for it to be release, again like so many others have done. I had no idea it was being released this year and on a whim I searched Amazon for it, lo and behold it was there and I instantly purchased it. The folklore and mysteries of this series had me hooked for many years. The characters are amazing, and so are the actors. I was sad for its ending but it was a good few years. I hope that season two is on its way shortly!",1153612800,8,555,3.920353982300885

2460403,5,B000CEV3MI,"Dont get me wrong, this is by far one of the best series ive seen...its addicting, fun, and of course SCARY AS HELL...im only by the second episode, thou i didn't like the first( the legacy). the second really picks up the deal, and for sure aims to please...(kicks butt) ect...the team is awesome (a psychic, a psychiatrist, a priest (really interesting) and last but not least THE 2 PERSONS THAT SHOULDN'T BE HERE ( A NAVY SEAL AND A COLLEGE GRAD???? WHAT THE HECK!!!!!!!!!!!! its my only little complain...the college grad (played by chong) shes just like a front desk person,,and the navy seal provides the bullets whenever theres an spiritual encounter/or human, and of course he has a big mouth....the rest of the team are cool..MY FAVORITE is the child of the psychiatrist...WHY??? well, her weapon in innocence, thefore she can actually see the ghosts with her bare eyes, and ghosts don't attack her due to her  childish purity..AWESOME!!!! if  you like to be scared, you love chills down your spine, BUY THIS and turn off the lights!!!!!!! ITS THE BEST SERIES OF THE BEST!!!!!!!!",1149724800,4,1088,4.81283422459893
2460404,5,B000CEV3MI,I bought this series from Wal-Mart for 24.00 dollars just on a whim. I had no idea the treat that I was buying. This is one of the best American Series that I have seen! As an American who does not watch American T.V. (I am a huge Brit fan) this is a surprise for my family and me! I would always see the title of this show on the SFI-Channel; but I thought it was a series from poltergeist the movie! Wow I missed a gold mine of a show. Waiting with open arms for season 2.,1147478400,6,474,3.8469387755102042

8098199,5,B000CEV3MI,"Wow! I just finished the 90 minute premier episode of this series. There is no point in waiting any further before logging in this critique. If you saw the series in it's US release back in the 80s, you ain't seen nothin' yet! This is the European version of this show and is as R rated as any theatrical feature of the time. The scares are quite creepy with eye popping special effects and the sex includes a demonic seduction that leaves nothing to the imagination. Keep the kiddies in the other room, Mommy. This is Halloween for the grown ups! I suspect this film actually got a foreign theatrical release before launching its TV syndication. What ever the rest of the series has in store, I am sure it will be a monster mash worth watching, if you are so inclined.  BTW, the show took itself quite seriously. So do not look for in jokes and characters mugging the camera. This is way beyond Tales From The Crypt. Deliberately horrific stuff,,,just the way we like it!  Insert maniacal laughter here.",1507161600,,1004,4.541436464088398
