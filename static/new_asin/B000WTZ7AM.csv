8225552,3,B000WTZ7AM,"I like to watch bad movies and try to find some enjoyment in them, which I was able to do with The Amazing Bulk. But with this...it was hard. There were a few corny jokes now and then that i liked but the rest is just...eh. The voice acting is meh, the animation is pretty bad, it's just so eh that it's unbearable. If you wanna watch it, go ahead. But I personally just think you should pass this one up.",1478390400,,405,4.012345679012346
8225553,1,B000WTZ7AM,"A terrible rip off of Bee movie.
Here is something that will make you weep Video Brinquedo's ripoff The Little Bee is oscarworthy compared to Plan Bee.
The Bees in this turkey look more like wasps and the backgrounds are mostly flat planes rather than modeled and rendered assets.
The voice acting is pretty lousy and the characters are very generic another trademark of Spark Plug garbage.
This crappy movie has more dialogue than action and the fight scene towards the climax is so stupid it is comical.
I also must ask what does US History have to do with Bees?
If you think I'm spoiling the movie. Too bad. Who cares! It isn't that good of a movie anyway.
Watch this hot stinking diarrhea on youtube but don't waste one cent on Plan Bee.
I can't decide which studio is worse Spark Plug or Video Brinquedo.",1477008000,,809,4.510204081632653
8225554,4,B000WTZ7AM,It's bizarre animation makes it an excellent piece for my collection.,1468713600,2,69,5.363636363636363
8225555,1,B000WTZ7AM,"I actually liked the Bee Movie, I have a love for films that are so bad that they're good.

So, I got this movie thinking it would be a bad, yet funny movie.

Oh, my, was I wrong. The animation is worse than The Little Panda Fighter, and just looks disgusting.",1444521600,3,260,4.078431372549019
8225556,5,B000WTZ7AM,"This was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. 10/10 would watch again.

This is a lot better than ""Bee Movie"" which is a cold rip-off, of this movie.",1398816000,9,157,4.064516129032258
8225557,1,B000WTZ7AM,it was nothing like bee movie and the story plot was good but it was not good enough to hold young viewers attention,1259280000,4,116,4.086956521739131
8225558,1,B000WTZ7AM,"If you pick up this film, see the words ""The Sting is in the Tale"", and think it's clever, then you might just enjoy this crappy ""Bee Movie"" knock off.  That's all I can really say about it.",1226361600,9,190,4.0
