5072548,5,B007AND296,"This was a great piece of honest journalism showing both sides of the story as best as possible about the building of the Wall more or less along the green line. However , since the report , still when Yassir Arafat was alive , we now know that he started the intifada with its suicide bombings as revealed by his wife but known by all Israelis. Unfortunately, today, while suicide bombings in Israel are down , probably because of "" The Wall""  many places in the Arab world that supported suicide bombings against Israel now have suicide bombings themselves on an almost daily basis - Syria, Iraq , to name a few countries. Unfortunately , in his analysis of the situation  , Friedman when talking about one man one vote forgets that the Arab and Bedouin and Druse population in Israel are citizens of the state of Israel, serve in the army if they want, and have the vote. So too Palestinians that choose to from Jerusalem. However, Israelis see the Palestinians as part of the greater Arab nation and as such, have to worry about a homeland for the Jewish people first. The only one among the many Arab states. For a viable Palestinian State  that official Israel also supports, the two state solution is viable, however, other neighboring nations will have to help re-draw the Ottoman Empire map and also give back lands they were arbitrarily given too much of, for a Palestinian state. That is why there is probably no peace today, for a fear of having to donate lands to the Palestinian cause. Jordan made peace with Israel for this exact  reason because she was afraid of the notion that is felt by many Israelis  that ""Jordan is Palestine"", and Egypt did not want to incorporate Gaza into Egypt for a similar reason. On another note, America today is even more supportive of  Israel strategically and politically, than since this report , not as Friedman predicted.

5072549,5,B007AND296,As usual Thomas Friedman goes to great lengths to find out the truth on both sides of the fence so to speak.  The ending is more riveting than a Hollywood blockbuster.,1348185600,,167,4.387096774193548
5072550,5,B007AND296,"I'm a big fan of Thomas L. Friedman's Reporting series.  This particular DVD, Straddling the Fence, outlines the issues at hand with the ""fence"" that physically separates the Israelis from the Palestinians and their ongoing conflict.  I've used this in my curriculum for my college course as a teaching tool, but I think everyone should see this report.",1334534400,4,353,5.068965517241379
5072551,5,B007AND296,"Thomas L. Friedman is the man for this job.  His vast experience perfectly suits him for this special.  It's an incredibly intense, controversial, and complicated topic and is explored perfectly by Friedman.  Very insightful and informative.  Must see.",1334534400,3,252,5.552631578947368
8513483,5,B007AND296,"Great! Very informative, especially with high schoolers. You will definitely have to give them some back drop and explain a few things but very good.",1476403200,,149,5.0
8513484,1,B007AND296,"The film claims to be unbiased but Mr. Friedman makes multiple mistakes due to his biases:
1- The film clearly does not mention that the settlements are illegal under international law.
2- The film fails to mention the economic suffering that the Palestinians communities experience at the hand of Israelis.
3- The film casually mentions that the wall is on Palestinian land not on the 1967 border.
4- The film fails to mention how the wall cut Palestinians away from their natural water resources.
5- The film fails to examine the continuous terrorism that the Israelis incur on the Palestinians via arrests without charges, casual shooting and killing of Palestinians, unequal pay, restriction of natural resources (water, trash pickup, etc...), and the continuous theft of their land!
6- The film presenter mentions Hamas often in the film when Hamas has no part to play in the West Bank at the time. Furthermore, the second intifada was started by the Palestinian people not Hamas or Fatah. It was started because of Ariel Sharon desecration of the Aqsa mosque in the year 2000.
7- The film gave numbers of how many Israelis died due to suicide bombings. I feel it should give numbers on how many Palestinians died in the same period.",1472774400,,1238,4.9
8513485,5,B007AND296,Fairly unbiased assessment of conditions along the wall in the West Bank. This kind of well rounded unbiased journalism is rare these days.,1461024000,,139,5.086956521739131

8513487,5,B007AND296,Friedman does a nice job of talking to both sides and capturing their attitudes. Worthwhile for anyone interested in the Middle East.,1427846400,,133,5.090909090909091
8513488,4,B007AND296,"Friedman has a personal opinion as an American liberal which which differs from the Palestinians and majority of Israelis. The perception of the opposing  forces are the Jews are occupiers and the Palestinians are terrorists, thus a political solution is impossible. What Christians know ( something that secular Jews have forgot) is that God has restored Israel back to the Jews and promises that never will they lose this land. Be real people, God does not bend to the rules of men, if it wan't his will that Israel is Jewish it wouldn't be. Friedman is missing the larger truth in his middle east reporting by omitting what the Bible and protestant Christians teach on why this situation exists and what the end result is. If he were to report what Christian theologians have to say on this matter he would produce documentaries that over the course of time would be compared to the dreams of Daniel himself. To see what Thomas Friedman and the liberal world is missing, just watch any of the end times prophecy videos out there and you will see what is in store for this region and why both sides of this issue are lost. As far as reporting goes, Friedman does a fine job in this movie.",1424563200,2,1190,4.586854460093897
8513489,5,B007AND296,"I particularly liked the comments of Mr. Friedman explaining why Americans think the way they do about Muslims, i.e. the ""if 19 Norwegians had attacked the U.S""......Whether it is right, or fair, or not, He expressed how many U.S. citizens regard this religion.",1411689600,,261,5.093023255813954

8513492,4,B007AND296,"This is a good documentary, but time has not been kind to the opinions expressed nor the dire predictions for the future.  While the fears of Palestinians may have been well justified, the barrier has proven its value as a security measure by reducing terrorism in Israel proper originating from the West Bank to almost zero.  The Palestinian claims that the barrier would destroy chances for a two state solution seem to have been more wishful thinking than reality.  Most Palestinians have never accepted a two state solution.  The barrier has not brought Israelis and Palestinians any closer to a solution, and it has surely made Israelis more complacent to the problems of individual Palestinians.  It would be interesting to hear if Tom Friedman has changed his opinions in the intervening years.",1362787200,9,801,5.037878787878788
