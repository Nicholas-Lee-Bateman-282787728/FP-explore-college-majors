8177613,5,B000NHHFE4,Bought this series years ago when I still had a good turn and before rotator cuff surgery.  I loved it then and I love it now that I'm old without a good turn and an improving shoulder.  It added consistency to my game then and now by letting me shoot for the number.  It made golf fun then and now.  I'll use this system till the end....,1503360000,,338,4.0

8177615,5,B000NHHFE4,I'm new to golf but this seems like it will help eventually. I am a little overwhelmed right now but he makes sense,1419465600,,115,4.043478260869565
8177616,5,B000NHHFE4,"This is a fantastic and easy to follow instruction set. I was a 16 handicap golfer prior to watching the Interlink Golf DVDs and had three consecutive rounds in the 70s after practicing the drills and adopting the ball position that Craig Johnson shows. I'm currently a 6 handicap. I used to hit a lot of chunk shots with my irons, now I make solid contact with all irons. My 8 iron used to go 145 - 150 when I made solid contact, it now goes 155-165 with all solid contact. My driver went from 240 with slice or hook to a straight or draw 275 - 285 !!  The non-release and release drills are very effective. Why has it taken this long to come up with a structured way to learn to play great golf?  Great job by Craig Johnson !",1409184000,,727,4.112676056338028
8177617,5,B000NHHFE4,"My husband had seen this system at a friend's house.  I found it at Amazon for a great price and bought it for his birthday.  The golf instruction is so easy to understand (even for me who is a complete novice) and clearly videod.  Craig Johnson is a very non intimidating instructor who works from the very basics on up. The DVD's plus the booklet are informative for the novice to the experienced who wants to improve their game at their own pace.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Interlink-Golf-System/dp/B000NHHFE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Interlink Golf System</a>",1236816000,,607,5.875
8177618,5,B000NHHFE4,"I'm definitely a novice--playing since May '08.  I followed the mechanics of the swing and literally added 30 yards to my shots on the very first practice! I used to hit a 9 iron 100 yards--applying the mechanics of the IGS swing, I can now hit my 9 iron 130 yards almost effortlessly.  Be patient and follow all the drills and when you get to your irons with a full swing, watch that ball fly 30 yards further!  AWESOME DVD!!!",1224633600,,427,4.3125
8177619,4,B000NHHFE4,"I have been playing golf for 35 years, so I've seen quite a few videos and read numerous books and magazines, and I have to say that this presentation is the simplest to understand, and most easily applied for the novice golfer.  He basically takes the swing down to its fundamental elements and teaches a simple, durable, one-piece swing that isn't complicated and doesn't have too many moving parts.

Experienced golfers will take issue with some of his ideas.  For example, he sets the wrist [...] in the address and completely ignores swing plane.  But I have tried his swing, both at the range and on the course, and I can tell you it works.  I rediscovered the basic draw off the tee that pops off the driver and rolls for a mile.  And I think my short game will improve tremendously as I lock-in his method with practice.  I think just about any experienced golfer will find quite a bit here that is worthy of consideration.

My biggest complaint is that he takes takes six tapes to tell you what he could have said in three tapes.  At times I wanted to throw a brick through my TV: ""OK I got it.  Get on with it!""

Bottom line: probably as good or better than a set of lessons for the beginner.  He covers it all, with a simple-to-understand system.",1201392000,5,1257,4.417391304347826
