However this story is kinda of interesting, I felt it had good acting and wasn't exaggerated, it also seemed to have a good budget.  The story is about a young woman who works at a beauty store? And has a shop lifting addiction it seems one day she helps another woman cover up her affair and soon the woman is trying to convince her to cheat.  Now the main character has been having problems with her husband, who has been very loving lately and seems distance.  She also has to deal with her annoying mother in law.  However she soon meets a man by coincidence and starts to develop feelings for him. I haven't watch to full drama but it's intresting and I recommend.",1529712000,,836,4.339743589743589
