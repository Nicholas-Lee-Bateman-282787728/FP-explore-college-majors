8715405,4,B00X8ROS4Q,"The final season of ""Kotter"" brought about many charges:There was no opening or closing joke segment-Most importantly,John Travolta was only featured in eight episodes-At this time,he was a hot commodity in the world of motion pictures & wasn't required to appear to all the episodes-Overall,season four had its share of hits & misses,but was still entertaining nonetheless.",1447372800,,374,5.578947368421052
8715406,3,B00X8ROS4Q,"A lot went on before AND behind the cameras during this final season. As per E-Hollywood, Kaplan and Strassman were in discord with the creator/ producer. Kaplan is missing from many episodes and does a wrap-around in others. The focus then is no longer the class room as they move Gabe into the VP office. Vinny drops-out and works as a hospital orderly, and fades away. A new Southern charmer named Beau takes-over the beef-cake role. Mrs. Kotter (after just having had twin daughters) becomes the office secretary. Arnold finds a love and eventually marries (in an episode that looks like an attempted spin-off). The original writers are replaced with Bob Claver (much to Hegyes dismay, as Shortridge said he threw one script across the room in anger). This season is an implosion like the final season of Lavern & Shirley- but have some good moments. Newcomer Shortridge does a good job and so do the original Sweethogs, but the teacher-student banter is lost.",1443139200,4,964,4.884146341463414
