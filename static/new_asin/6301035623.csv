308516,5,6301035623,"A gem from my younger years.  One of the few feature length cartoons of the era that actually required and insipred thought.  If you're looking for an action flick like Titan A.E. or Final Fantasy, this isn't it.  If you're looking for the animated lovechild of ""Brazil"" and ""Clockwork Orange""  Then you've come to the right place.",1064793600,2,331,4.754385964912281
308517,5,6301035623,I was really impressed by the artistic quality and engrossing fictional nature of film.  A good movie to watch more than once.,1036540800,3,126,4.7272727272727275
308518,5,6301035623,"as far as science fiction movies go, it can't be topped.  Between the animation which gave the director the freedom to portray the full image in which was intended to get across and the mind bending though of the movie, even 14 years later is on the top on my list.",1017360000,4,265,4.196078431372549
308519,5,6301035623,"Lightyears was one of the first epic animated sci-fi movies created.
The story is futuristic hard sci-fi at it's best.  The animation is good, however the sound track is a little much at times.
If you enjoy hard science fiction books (Asimov, Niven, A.C Clark etc)  then you will likely enjoy this movie",1007942400,2,303,4.69811320754717
308520,5,6301035623,"While it is true that at the time of this writing light years is unavailable for purchase, you can still rent it. It might be a little hard to find but it's worth the search. I can't think of anything bad to say  about it at all. The background artwork is stunning, The animation while  not perfect, is still wonderful and the plot is well thought out. While  there are a few bits of technology that may seem unbelievable, it is  important to remember that the race in question is highly technologically  advanced. If you happen to find a copy available for rent; do so. It's  definitely worth seeing, preferably several times.",955238400,3,627,4.553571428571429
308521,5,6301035623,"I loved this movie. I love many adult animated movies (example: Heavy Metal, Wizards, Fritz The Cat, Heavy Traffic, etc.).
I have known about this movie for years now and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in  adult animated movies. If you liked this one, you might like Heavy Metal  and Wizards.",954288000,4,304,4.716981132075472
308522,5,6301035623,Light Years is a very atypical animation.  The artwork is inspiring and the story line very thought provoking.  I think that it was a very intelligently made animation and plan to purchase a copy of my own.  I  highly recommend it over the many overly violent animated films today.,912038400,,281,4.673469387755102
308619,5,6301035623,Best movie I have ever seen. Even though there was brief nudity in the film the special effects were off the hook. The music totally awsome.,1294272000,,140,4.423076923076923
308620,5,6301035623,"I saw this movie a number of times as a young child. In a time when everything was mindless action (GI Joe, Transformers, Real Ghostbusters) this movie was a refreshing STORY worth seeing. It still had some action, but where the heart of this movie is really at is the way its told. A must buy for any fan of the classics of Issac Isamov.

I'm buying this for myself as soon as I save up enough money.",1289260800,2,401,4.141025641025641
308621,4,6301035623,"Well it's not on DVD so if you want this movie you need to get it on VHS, I transferred mine to DVD worked great. Movie was in excellent condition.",1233878400,,147,3.933333333333333
308622,5,6301035623,"This is one of the best films I've ever seen.  There are two main types of science fiction, one trying to extrapolate real possibilites of existinc science with a taste for adventure.  The other is an exploration of mankind from within using science fiction as a background.  The first type is fun, but over time it becomes the ""Buck Rogers"", the ""Jules Verne Steampunk"" stuff.  The second type is usually not well recieved at its time, but becomes classic over the years, ""The Time Machine"" by Wells, for example.  ""Star Maker"" by Stapledon.  ""Exile of the Aeons"" a short story by A.C. Clarke.  The story lives on long after when it was written and the 'ill thought super-science' becomes more real and a not to distant possibility.",1164672000,4,733,4.724409448818897
308623,5,6301035623,"This is one of the best animated movies of all time. The artwork is superb, the sound track is very well suited to the story and theme, and the story is even better. A true classic.  Some people don't like the animation, but I find it much better than the garbage 'anime' that is produced today. I wish that it would be produced in DVD format. This is a must for any SciFi fan's collection.",1137628800,9,390,4.2
308624,5,6301035623,"I feel sorry for the guy who missed out on this film. It like many films that jar the old grey matter are bypassed in the mainstream for flash and flesh that have little else to sustain interest. I loved Akira, but its a different film, like comparing the subtle humor and thought in Local Hero to the flash and chaotic carnage of 28 Days Later, different animals. I highly recommend this film...i've been looking for it for years and finally added it to my collection.",1133568000,5,469,4.465116279069767
308625,5,6301035623,"First off, to the guy who can only say ""sucks"" and ""crappiness"" without any real content in his post, i'm sorry you require your movies to do your thinking for you. If you find yourself wishing the movie would end so you can do something else, just stand up and turn it off and save your biliousness for yourself.

The animation, while definitely 80's, fits the story perfectly. The movie is a good rendition of a book and tells the story better than most book to movie conversions. There seem to be a lot of underlying statements during the movie, not the least of which is a warning against overindustrialization but the way the story unfolds is intriguing and engaging.",1118966400,8,672,4.6
308626,4,6301035623,"Don't take that as a slap in the face to the movie. I thought the film was great, and the story was really, well, for lack of a better term, 'awesome'.  The entire paradox issue, and the fantastic storytelling (come on, it's Asimov for gods sake) can make one completely overlook the bad 80's American animation.  Can someone find the artist for ""Heavy Metal"" and arrest them?  thanks.
Anyway, one of the reviewers mentioned ""If you can stand this crappy animation for more than 5 minutes..."".  Someone is obviously only interested in flashy graphics.  It's about the story there, shecky.. the STORY.  While I agree that the art is not exactly Akira, or Ghost in the Shell, it really beats the snot out of stuff like the old Lord of the Rings movies... (that Balrog... THE HORROR!!).
If you like movies that require you to think about the story to understand it, then this is the movie for you, if you like movies that are only eye candy, this is NOT the movie for you.  This movie makes me think of Donnie Darko.  I'm gonna go watch it now.",1088121600,9,1041,4.470899470899471
308627,5,6301035623,"Light Years (I never understood the US title), or `Gandahr' as it's called out of the US is not your usual run-of-the-mill animation. The animation is good for it's time and has a unique style that is dissimilar from the usual animation types of the time (Disney, Rankin & Bass, and Anime).
Gandahr is more of a `thinking' animation. I'll admit I didn't understand a lot of what went on in the movie until I watched it again as an adult. There are action scenes, but they are toned down by the fact the enemies are robots. If you're looking for beat-em-up knock-em-down action, this isn't the film for you. If you want something that makes you think, this is right up your alley.
I would note, for parents' sake, this movie does contain mild nudity, although it is tastefully done and does not detract from the film itself.  There are some creepy sequences, but it's not your usual bloody-gorey animation you see these days.
Overall, I still really like this film.",1078963200,27,964,4.604651162790698
308628,4,6301035623,"Light Years, while not as flashy as the animated movies of today is a marvelous story that bridges the gap between fantasy and sci-fi. As a child the story and its amazing visuals captivated me. The movie is full of symbolism. For example the incredible irony that the villian of the film is a creation of the peaceful kingdom that genetically engineered him and that said villian (a giant brain) employs an army of mechanical men to wage his wars in the pursuit of more power. Then, seeing that his waring ways are leading to an ugly apocalypse of sorts, the villian is his own downfall as he sets in motion the events that will ultimately be his undoing. It speaks to the ever present conflict between nature and industrialization and perhaps how humankind may be its own worst enemy.  My only gripe is that I wish they would re-release it on dvd. Oh well. A fantastic movie experience if you can get your hands on it. It is sure to please viewers of all ages.",1068249600,19,962,4.465909090909091

Several famous actors/actress did the voice talent.
Believe it or not this animation has a plot you can understand.
The characters are believable and have a decent storyline
It does NOT have any long pointy hair or gigantic swords and talk incredibly fast.
I recommend viewing if given the opportunity.",1515196800,,405,5.059701492537314

I have had the Light Years VHS tape for many, many years now and it is beyond me why this isn't on DVD yet.  I see a vast amount of trash come out on DVD and far to many good movies like this can't be enjoyed because the format restricts it to a handful of those that still have VHS machines.  Unfortunately it is not televised from what I have seen on SYFY or any other network.

The movie is visually enchanting and the story is mesmerizing. A hero and heroine emerge when an evil power mad brain appears from a thousand years in the future.  It begins to destroy the placid society that has been one with nature for centuries.",1392768000,,880,4.6688311688311686
