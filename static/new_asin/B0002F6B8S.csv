2091339,3,B0002F6B8S,"We love the visual presentation of division concepts and the fact that so many division problems are presented. The concepts are presented well so that a learner can progress from the visual presentation of division all the way to division fact memorization. I still feel Rock 'n Learn videos are lacking in their 'engagement factor' with children. Leap Frog has a much more engaging way of teaching the concepts they cover. The Science Videos by Rock 'n Learn are moving towards that Leap Frog, story-telling, character based learning style. However, the Math Rock 'n Learn videos are lacking that. Rock 'n Learn videos do have strengths in visual presentation of math concepts and in repetition of presentation, both of which are important. I'd also like to see the division facts of 10, 11, and 12 covered in this video.",1239494400,2,823,4.928057553956834

It features DJ Doc Roc and three cartoon characters named Nelson, Michelle and Rappin' Sebastian, who introduce the principles of division by using colorful graphics, spotlights, popcorn, pennies, blocks, and even boom boxes as illustrations.

It covers dividends, divisors and quotients as well as remainders, and also provides a very quick look at long division.  It ends with a series of drills, allowing viewers some division practice.  A series of songs introduce dividing by one and by the number itself; dividing by two, three, four and so on up to nine.  The dividends in each sequence go up to multiples of nine, and are in random order.  Each one is then repeated in a different order.

The highlight for me is that it clearly shows how division and multiplication are related, and how you can check the answers to division problems using multiplication tables. The low point again is (unfortunately) the rapping.

Catchy enough to hold a child's attention, this is a handy revision tool for students preparing for end of term exams, or those who just need a little encouragement.

2091401,2,B0002F6B8S,"Rock and Learn DVDs are high interest learning tools that help students to not only grasp concepts, but they also entertain.

I use Rock and Learn DVDs and videos to set students schema, entertain, grab their attention, introduce concepts, and provide scaffolding.

This particular DVD introduces the concept of division, and it consists of one DVD which has 21 sections--intro., learn to divide, definitions, ck with mult., parts of div. prob., dividing obj., everyday div., division practice, ramainders, story prob., intro. to long div., div. by zero, one, two,three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine.

The DVD uses cool rap music, comical characters, and a character by the name of D.J. Doc Roc to practice division.

This DVD is an excellent follow-up tool after direct instruction.  The DVD does not thoroughly explore division concepts, content specific terms, and division facts.

This DVD should not be relied on to teach these particular skills as it does not provide review of pre-division skills.

It would be most useful as a reinforcement of taught skills and concepts.

It is a cute, fun, and very entertaining DVD that provides rote memory reinforcement using rap music techniques.

However, it is not an adequate content specific tool because it does not fulfill the criteria for selecting educational videos, e.g., correlation to currculum standards, enhance the instructional content beyond the traditional, cognitively engaging and not merely entertaining, and assessment.

Pros:  Colorful, energetic, lively, graphics, cartoons, music, and characters

Cons:  No preskills, over repetition of similar graphics, and transitions do not vary from one concept to the other and tend to run together without differienting between cocepts.  I lost interest at menu six dividing real objects, I tried to view the DVD again, and I became annoyed with the over represenation of the same graphics.

Please note that Rock and Learn has since reworked this particular DVD from this earlier version made in 2003.  I can certainly see why!  I'm looking forward to reviewing the updated version.",1354320000,,2106,5.333333333333333
