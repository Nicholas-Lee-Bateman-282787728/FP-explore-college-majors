4714116,5,B005K0WD6Y,"This brief biography of Blessed Teresa of Calcutta is great for teaching anyone middle-school and older how we can live Gospel values in contemporary communities. It was produced in the 90's, so the production value isn't what we are accustomed to, but it's well worth a watch.",1379462400,,277,4.914893617021277

4714118,5,B005K0WD6Y,"I expected a little hype when I watched this but all I can say is ""Amazing."" It is impossible to watch the life's work of this gentle woman and not see Jesus and his love for humanity in everything she did.",1361491200,,206,4.048780487804878

4714123,5,B005K0WD6Y,"nice, short (30min) coverage of the life of Mother Teresa. The documentary puts her work in an historical context too, so you can see somewhat what was going on in the world at various times during her ministry.

The documentary follows a non-controversial and almost secular worldview; it doesn't touch on her spirituality or her order's charism. It doesn't cover criticisms or controversies either, so this documentary will be appropriate for a broad demographic, and would be good to show to children. I think it is a little dry for very young children, but age seven and up might get something out of it.

This is a good introduction to Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta and would make a good starting point for further research.",1428624000,2,733,4.856
4714124,5,B005K0WD6Y,Good historical info and I shed  tear.,1424390400,,38,4.428571428571429
4714125,1,B005K0WD6Y,"No mention of Mother Teresa's dealings with the Devalio Crime family, or her crusade against condoms and birth control in developing countries, basically poor propaganda to deify someone who has very questionable morals to the discerning academic.",1410480000,,247,5.702702702702703
4714126,5,B005K0WD6Y,very inspiring and a beautiful story. It will make you feel like serving even if you don't know how to start or what to do. Excellent film.,1405036800,,139,4.185185185185185

4714128,5,B005K0WD6Y,"I was greatly moved by the sacrifice and dedication to the needs of her kindred spirits.  I don't believe in the political process of canonization, but I do believe that Mother Teresa lived a life of exemplary kindness and compassion.  So, what makes one a saint?",1387497600,2,263,4.695652173913044
8476369,5,B005K0WD6Y,"Inspiring and breath taking.  Because of this I have decided to sacrifice an indulgence for the reparation of sinners, unbelievers, souls in Purgatory and where ever else wants to God disperse His Grace.",1474243200,,203,5.151515151515151
8476370,5,B005K0WD6Y,I likes the documentary. It was precise & informative. It did not embellish too much or draw too much drama. Blessed Mother Teresa was a gift from God to this world & one of the things she wanted was to glorify Hom & not herself. You did a great job of that!,1472256000,,258,3.980769230769231
8476371,4,B005K0WD6Y,Very good documentary! A pleasure to watch,1466899200,,42,5.142857142857143
8476372,2,B005K0WD6Y,"Having studied much about this blessed Saint, I felt a lack of passion in the film. I felt it did not capture her passion, or her sacrifice in a manner worthy of life. The film focused on the letters that she wrote in her life which describe her sufferings. I just wish it could have been portrayed with more passion worthy of this wonderful Saint. The film is worth a view... but if you want to understand Mother Theresa in more detail, you should read about her life in it's entirety.",1466208000,,486,4.351648351648351
8476373,5,B005K0WD6Y,Very thought provoking. Mother Teresa was awesome!.,1465689600,,51,6.428571428571429
8476374,5,B005K0WD6Y,This was a very good documentary on the life of Mother Teresa. I would recommend to many who even have just a thought of driving as Jesus did. Mother Teresa exemplifies the laying down of one's life to serve others. B!Essex to have watched it!!,1464739200,,244,4.444444444444445
8476375,5,B005K0WD6Y,Enjoyed this Documentary very much about a true human being and the love she gave all people.  I found out more about her life as a young girl and her call to help and love the poor.  Very well done!,1458518400,,199,3.95
