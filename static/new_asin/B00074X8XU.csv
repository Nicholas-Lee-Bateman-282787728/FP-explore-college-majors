8044972,2,B00074X8XU,"It's a nice series of lectures by prominent columnists about the evils of capitalism in America. A number of facts are given, and there are various allegations of evil conspiracies to make a handful of Americans rich by keeping the majority of Americans poor. The intellectuals cited by the columnists include Habermas, Rawls, Kant, and Jefferson. The most disturbing thing about this video was not its expose of poverty in America, but how it put together its argument either without context or with connotative associations. For example, it would say that America was bad for once having had slavery--skipping over the context that slavery existed around the world and America remains the only country to have fought a civil war over it, if you don't include events such as the Spartacus revolt. For its strange use of emotionally-laden words, I note that the mascots they refer to, the deserving and innocent poor, are referred to as ""church-going"" while selfish and corrupt politicians and businessmen are referred to as ""religious extremists.""
  Finally, the use of facts deserves careful circumspection. At the beginning Barbara Ehrenreich gives a riveting account of how impossible she found it was to live with dignity while working at low-paying jobs such as for Wal-Mart. She said that it was impossible to find any single apartment in the Twin Cities for under $800. Just click on Craigslist, and you can see for yourself to what extent her account should be seen as accurate and definitive.
  I also find it questionable by how they use the argument by authority out of context. For example, one speaker cites the Roman Catholic Church on the evils of capitalism--which would be fine for Catholics, but the Catholic Church is also against safe-sex, abortion, gay marriage, and sex for reasons other than procreation, as well as possessing many other related positions. To remember the dangers of context-dropping, remember it is unwise to pull the nose of the camel into your tent--because the rest will be soon to follow!",1308268800,,2034,5.062686567164179
