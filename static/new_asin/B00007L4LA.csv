7977758,2,B00007L4LA,"I have seen this film before and loved it, (Netflix) so ordered a new copy. Something is seriously flawed with this particular DVD. Poor
sound quality, the sequence was scrambled, and someone somehow made ""chapters"" which required me to reset the playing every
few minutes. Very strange and disconcerting.

I was given another copy , which is just as it should be---clear, complete, and enjoyable",1462838400,,396,5.092307692307692
7977759,5,B00007L4LA,"It's a pretty fine film because I made it, not Judy Collins, who produced it  that is put up the money. Antonia Brico had been her piano teacher back when Judy lived in Denver, before she became a folksinger, and Judy wanted to do something for her. But I called the shots and edited the film. Judy wouldn't know how to make a film if her life depended on it. The credits on the actual film read ""directed by Judy Collins and Jill Godmilow"" which we both agreed to. Why she's allowing various companies to put it out as ""directed by Judy Collins"" is a mystery. If you listen to the interview on the DVD with Studs Terkel you'll understand who made the film. Someday she might wise up and get the credits right, I hope.",1454803200,3,718,4.279411764705882
7977760,4,B00007L4LA,"I saw this on PBS years ago after Judy Collins produced it, and always wanted my own copy to keep. It's a wonderful story, and one I know, since I played for Antonia Brico when I lived in Denver in the '60s. Something I can keep forever.",1399334400,3,237,4.0638297872340425
7977761,5,B00007L4LA,"I was a child when I first met Dr. Brico. My sister took private lessons from her. I would sit in awe, watching and listening to this great woman instruct my eldest sister. My family would attend her symphonies and watch her conduct. She was fascinating and wonderfully kind. She came alive in her interviews with Ms. Collins and was exactly as I remembered her. I only wish more of her home had been shown and her little dog, who was, as far as I know, her only companion. She was one of a kind. I'm not sure why anyone would describe her as bitter. She may have had clear understandings of right and wrong, but she was not a bitter person.",1322956800,11,641,4.262295081967213
7977762,4,B00007L4LA,"When this film was nominated for the Oscar, I was living in Madison, WI; my favorite Professor Karlos Moser was a student of Ms Brico, and invited her to Madison in conjunction with the showing of the film. I also attended a talk/lecture by Ms Brico. She was indeed an inspiration for all, and a charming individual. Jill Godmilow is known for advancing the perception of women in public/ professional areas. It's a good film, with the generous support of Judy Collins, and it's hard to say of Ms Brico's stance as a great conductor. Certainly, she was a pioneer and a maverick, and is to be applauded. As a teacher, her reputation is legendary among those who know of her. The film itself was a bit self-congratulatory, with a dose of sour grapes. The lovely, talented lady was deserving of more ""in concert"" moments and the niceness of the producers and directors didn't really hit the nerve of the music ""business"". And, back then, everything was about business. Listening to her in person was more enjoyable and informative than the film itself. The wonderful woman's story simply didn't translate to this very short film. She will be remembered by many.",1289260800,,1158,4.766169154228856
7977763,5,B00007L4LA,"This is an extremely important film about a fine musician whose career was unjustly curtailed only because she was a woman.  People may think that the situation is better today, however it is not.  None of the top orchestras in the United States has a female music director.

2013 update, ten years later:
The situation is slightly better today in the American symphonic world with Marin Alsop serving as the Music Director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, a post she has held since 2007 and her current contract promises to keep her in Baltimore until 2021.",1066348800,13,562,4.833333333333333
