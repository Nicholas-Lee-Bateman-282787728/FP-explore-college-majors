6071849,5,B00GD3VYV2,"Against the Grain is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The characters were very well
developed. It is very engaging and the time went by very quickly. Even
though I am different from the actors in age, race, education,
economics, etc., I identified with the characters because of the
universal emotions so well portrayed. This movie should be shown in all
high schools to show students what is possible and encourage those
struggling to meet their goals. Especially it should be shown to young
black males and any student about to give up and drop out. As a
resident of Oakland, I can testify that the scenes presented are very
realistic. This film deserves the ""best of show"" and """"audience
favorite"" awards it has won in many film festivals.",1389657600,4,750,4.6893939393939394

6071867,5,B00GD3VYV2,The relationships are touching and feel genuine. This is something that should be shown in inner city kids to show it not easy but you can do it .

6071868,2,B00GD3VYV2,"Isaiah (Vaughn Wilkinson) is from Oakland and is Berkley bound. He is going to study to be a neurosurgeon. His mom has had brain cancer for a few years now. While at school, he gets in trouble due to his home boys coming to visit and ends up on probation. He needs the help of a tutor to maintain his grades, a well to do woman (Amaris Davidson). His roommate is the stereotypical white guy from Orange Co. (David Coe).

The message of the film is just great. In order for the black man to succeed, he must play the white man's game, same message of ""Life of a King."" However in this film, it hits on nearly every racial stereotypical cliche and does so rather poorly. I found myself groaning from time to time as the white man asked, ""What sport do you play?"" The acting approached that of a high school drama.

The film was written, produced, directed, and edited by Elias Mael who tried to cram too much into 90 minutes making the message far too overt. I would recommend ""Life of a King"" over this production.

6071869,5,B00GD3VYV2,"This film  captures the divide between youths with the courage to change and those that become trapped in the never ending cycle of poverty, drugs and violence. A theme that has been played out before, but not as well done. The acting is great.",1390608000,,244,4.545454545454546

8622216,5,B00GD3VYV2,"Against the Grain would have been much better if the sound quality would have been top notch. Cinematography wasn't bad, and the acting wasn't horrible. Against the Grain is far better than many of the low budget movies of color on Amazon Prime.

EDITED: Very good story that wasn't about glorifying street mentality over a good education (or ditching family/God over Baphomet). There was a mother, a father, and a girlfriend who looked like Michelle Obama on beauty pills and the combination worked.. I'm really glad I watched it all the way through.",1493856000,,551,4.924731182795699
