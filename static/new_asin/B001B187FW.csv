8281028,4,B001B187FW,"I can only fault this film for price. I believe that Inland Empire, a hugely ambitious 3 hr. film including Lynch Two and a lot of other worthwhile content costs around the same (I bought Lynch One for over [...]bucks). Many people were disappointed in Inland Empire. That, at least amongst Lynch fans, baffles me in one way, but in light of how painful it can be, not. Anyway if that is the case with you, ignore this. It has a lot to do with the creative process behind the film. Lynch is probably one of the few living film-makers who is not fooled by the Hollywood  dualistic deception between the 'entertaining' side of film and the side of a film that gives its artistic merit. I cannot say that I can name another film-maker living or dead, American or other, who so focused on fulfilling his own creative endeavors apart from secondary ambitions. Inland Empire, and Lynch is not worried about entertaining the spectators. The movie can be painful. Hell is a theme, and I would cite it as a major theme. There has not been a film, in my opinion, that has come close to Inland Empire for the magnitude of artistic accomplishment. Anyway, this film gives a surface look at the creative process Lynch uses. You will not get inside his head. He will not talk about meaning. One of the best things he does say is that an artist can't do good work when he's suffering. People are even starting to realize this about Van Gogh. The painter suffered a lot, and the suffering showed him things that would have otherwise remained hidden, yet he could only paint when he was through the roughest times. Anyway, to be honest, what you'll be paying for is a bonus disc if you buy this, though i must say one that is done very well. Beautiful photography and tidbits about inland empire. At ten, twelve bucks, it would be a no-brainer, but over twenty? Well, I suspect the hardcore Lynch fans will buy it anyway, but if you're missing one of his features, buy that first.",1261958400,,1963,4.49859943977591
8281029,4,B001B187FW,"It's great to be able to see Lynch at work in something more concrete than a DVD extra or two, and this doc gives fairly good insight into the man doing his thing. The four stars come from that.

Had to take a star away because of how short it is compared to how much footage was shot, and also because the director did a bit of an amateurish job of imitating Lynch's trademark visual mechanisms and scattered editing style. I would've rather just had a straight-up 200 minute documentary about Lynch without any huge focus on artistic representation(outside of Lynch at work of course): if the mystery is being exposed to a certain degree, don't try to shroud it in mystery's cloak.

A must-have for Lynch fans though.",1239321600,9,719,4.565891472868217
8281030,3,B001B187FW,"I was hoping for more in depth interviews and insights into Lynch's film making.  This definitely has its moments, but not enough of them.  I'm a Lynch devotee, and glad I saw this despite its disappointing general lack of insight.  I hope the next two in the series are more revealing.",1231977600,3,286,4.568627450980392
8281031,5,B001B187FW,"From the first scene I was gripped and fascinated, not only by the eccentric Lynch, but by the pure artistry of the film itself.  From the music and sounds to the vivid imagery and the intelligence of the storytelling I found the film a complete experience.  I highly recommend this film.",1219968000,19,288,4.627450980392157
