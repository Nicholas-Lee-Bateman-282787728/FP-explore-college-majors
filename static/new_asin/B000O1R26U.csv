8182698,2,B000O1R26U,"This movie was OK but not great.  The scenery was beautiful, the music was enchanting, and it was well acted, but for several reasons it fell flat.  It might have been a little more enjoyable if it had not been built upon the the foundation of a much beloved literary classic.  Very few writers have talent enough to produce books whose appeal reaches across age barriers and across generations of readers.  But when a decently interesting story tries to measure up to a work of genius, the faults are magnified.  I think I might have enjoyed this story more if it hadn't tried to go into the future of characters I have learned to love.  It was a let-down.

***SPOILERS AHEAD - PROCEED WITH CAUTION***

It is hard to watch this and not feel a pang of disappointment.  We all have our fantasies about how Mary, Colin, and Dickon lived happily ever after, but to have our bubble burst in such a harsh way is depressing.  I didn't want to think that Dickon's heart was broken.  I didn't want to think that Colin was killed in WWI leaving Mary a widow.  I didn't want to hear about how Mary mysteriously dropped dead in the garden.  I didn't want to know that Colin and Mary's child was a cripple, who was withdrawn and bitter.  I didn't want to know that their grandchildren died young, leaving one lonely and sickly orphaned child behind.  I didn't want to know that the beloved Garden was cursed by an evil spell and died again.  If this same story had been told as an independent tale about unearthing a family curse that had ruined generations of people I didn't know, I might have rooted for the kids in this story and been glad for them when they resolved the tragedy.  But to  ruin the end of the original SECRET GARDEN with dreadful tales of tragic outcomes was not exactly the best way to make me enjoy this story.

Another thing I didn't like was the way the lead character was written.  I get that they were trying to make a parallel to Mary's original character, but it just didn't fly.  The original Mary was a nasty little brat because she had never been loved or wanted.  She wasn't likable, but knowing her tragic existence helped the audience feel compassion for her, and we were all touched by the way the true goodness in her heart emerged in the Garden.  We rooted for her and for Colin and Lord Craven.  In contrast, Katherine's life contained no tragic mitigating circumstances.  She was loved and wanted.  Katherine was a nasty little brat, but there wasn't any real reason for it.  She was just nasty and so instead of being a tragic heroine, she was simply unlikeable.  When she softened, it just didn't have the same effect on me.  I just thought, ""WELL!  It's about TIME!""

I think what I'm trying to say is that we should be very careful when trying to enhance something that was perfect.  With very few exceptions, we just ruin a good thing.  I doubt if even Frances Hodgson Burnett herself could have written a sequel that would have lived up to the original story.  Perhaps that is why she didn't try.",1406678400,11,3030,4.478976234003657
