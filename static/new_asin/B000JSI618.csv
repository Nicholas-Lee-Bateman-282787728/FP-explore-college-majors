Love it  - Great show!!",1169078400,,138,4.230769230769231
2678969,5,B000JSI618,"This DVD ranks at the top of our choices for our grandchildren, ages 2, 4, 5, and 6.  Hi-5 not only inspires little ones to sing and dance along with performers, it teaches them to accept the differences in individuals and cultures.  When we first discovered Hi-5, we had to have DVDs and CDs for each household.  We are happy to add Move Your Body and Action Heroes to our collection.  A GOOD BUY!",1168819200,,398,4.337837837837838
2678970,5,B000JSI618,"We have been following the American Hi-5 for several years.  As noted in another review of this product, there is also an Australian Hi-5.  Some people only know the Australian cast and like anything - what you first learned is probably what you like best.  Well, for us, the AMERICAN Hi-5 is the only Hi-5 we know and they are wonderful.  Some people might compare them to the Wiggles in the type of children's show that they deliver since it is all ""real"" people performing as opposed to animation.  However, unlike the Wiggles, the cast of Hi-5 is very diverse both in ethnicity and gender.  It is wonderful to see a diverse cast harmonize so well in their songs and play so well together in their skits.

If you are unsure whether Hi-5 is for your children or not, you can watch them on Discovery Kids or the Learning Channel early in the morning on weekdays.  Check your listings for the exact time since it changes from time to time.

I would just like to add that we have met the cast of Hi-5 a few times in the past when they performed in Malls and at amusement parks.  Each of the cast members are genuinely interested in the children for whom they are performing.  There is no doubt that the children are why they do what they do.  They are starting to tour again now and if you can see them perform anywhere near you I think your children will love the show.",1168646400,9,1369,4.346456692913386
2678971,5,B000JSI618,"My 5 and 3 year old girls have been Hi-5 fans for several years now since we first discovered them on TLC.  We are soooo happy to see these new DVD's coming out, I hope there will be more to come.  My children learn so much and get up and move around while watching these DVD's...definitley not couch potato music!! My one year old has even started dancing to it as well!  One of the best things about the music from this group is that parents won't get sick of it like some other kids groups.  The songs are well written and humorous so that adults can withstand sitting through watching them over and over and over!!!  :)",1168560000,,623,4.245762711864407
2678972,1,B000JSI618,"I stupidly bought this video thinking it was the original Australian Hi-5 group...but I was sadly disappointed.  The songs aren't as catchy, the skits were horrible, and after barely making it through the video once, we swore we'd never watch it again.",1168300800,3,252,5.0
2678973,5,B000JSI618,"I bought 2 of the videos for my 2 yr. old grandson, and it's all he wants to play with! Animation and cartoons don't hold his attention, but he thinks he is right there dancing with the other kids! Every episode we have watched on tv has had some kind of lesson, AND it's alot of fun-singing, dancing, and storytelling. I'll be ordering the rest of the DVDs for Easter baskets and birthdays!",1167177600,4,391,4.36986301369863
2678974,5,B000JSI618,"My 3-yr old daughter LOVES this DVD. We just got it last week and it has been played almost every day.  I think she's already memorized most of it :-)  Would highly recommend for any Hi-5 fan. I like that they don't play the same song over and over like in previous DVDs and we were happy to find ""Senses"" on this one!",1166313600,5,318,4.031746031746032
2678975,5,B000JSI618,"The DVD's are great, and they are a different format than the three previous releases (Game Time, Music Magic and Color Craze) Instead of having three shows from the same Theme of the Week, they have bits of each theme, and three themes on each...does that make sense? Ok here ya go.....

Move Your Body DVD has bits from

Five Senses

Move Your Body

and North, South, East and West (CPP - my favorite)

Action Heroes has bits from

duh, Action Hero

T.E.A.M (another fave)

Underwater Discovery

It's very refreshing to see three songs instead of seeing the same song 6 times on a DVD, with two back to back.....much less irritating for dads and frazzled moms!

Plus, the Move Your Body DVD has the best skit ever....Captain Puffy Pants baby!! WOOT!!! That is absolutley the most hilarious skit ever....Everybody does a great job on that skit, and they especially did an awesome job at the MYB tour....(shhh I heard they did it special for me...hey...it's not bragging if it's true!!! he he!!!---hey I wonder if they put CPP in the commercial and the new DVD for me too......a girl can dream!!!!)

The dvds are durable, so if you entrust your techno gizmos to little ones, they are perfect....they are brightly colored, so it will catch the eyes of the little ones at the store...

If you want a fun and eduacational show that will have your kids singing and dancing and learning about shapes, music, numbers, vocabulary and using their imaginations, this is a great show that will have the whole family singing along...a great buy!",1165708800,18,1534,4.704119850187266

2678983,3,B000JSI618,"In watching this DVD with my almost 3 grand daughter, yes, it was cute, it got both of us up dancing/exercising, but I was a ""bit Taken back"", with the ""belly dance"" sequence....Thought it a bit ""much"" for toddlers to 5 year old. Sorta sexual , the movements . They could have picked another dance, maybe ""disco or the Jive.

Spanish is our first language and he starting to leran how to communicate, I don't want to confuse him. The Dvd is very high quality and the arrival was really fast, but I'm very dissappointed that it did not have the features that Amazon adevertises.

I printed a document with the specific information from the AMAZON website (in case you delete it).

My son was veeeery sad, and me ... i was veeery angry and lost eleven dolars. So, don't be fooled like me. there is no spanish in this disk.

PS. I'm still angry for the bad moment and the disappointment face on my son.",1231804800,5,806,4.261437908496732

2678996,5,B000JSI618,My two year old boy loves all the Hi-5 videos.  He can watch it over and over again (The Hi-5 videos are the only ones that he will watch the entire 45 minutes).

2679003,5,B000JSI618,"Our kids have certainly enjoyed this DVD. Big Hi-5 fans in our house. Only complaint is that for those of us without cable access, more segments or complete episodes would be nice. As I said, our kids are big fans. Most of the time I appreciate the automatic restarting of the DVD once it has played since it is about 45 minutes long.",1200960000,,334,4.317460317460317

2679005,4,B000JSI618,"If you watch the show (or rather your kids watch the show), then this is a good compilation of some of their better skits and songs.  It's good for road trips, or bedtime.  I hear they're not doing any new episodes after the 2006 season, so this may be all we get.",1197936000,,264,4.0576923076923075
2679006,5,B000JSI618,"This is such a fun and energetic DVD.  The songs and dancing are great.  My kids never tire of watching it! They love all the Hi-5 videos. It is great entertainment for the kids, and adults too! And they have some good messages too.",1187827200,,232,4.25
2679007,1,B000JSI618,"The skits are somehow less engaging with this cast. The girls look like dolls and the female voices are horrid, especially Kimee's. Painful. Hate the version of the series. Even as Americans, we prefer the Australian version.",1183248000,,225,5.108108108108108

2679009,5,B000JSI618,"We love Hi-5!!  Each episode not only educates your child (on subjects like food, senses, animals, etc.) but really gets the kids up and moving.  It is very hard for a child to watch this show without getting up and dancing, clapping, & singing with the Hi-5 gang.  This show also puts emphasis on social skills like friendship, manners, and self-esteem.  We really like the new packaging on these dvds, it just adds a bit more to the fun of Hi-5.  They have a handle so the kids can carry them around--great for taking to grandma's!!",1177891200,2,534,4.520833333333333
2679010,5,B000JSI618,IF your kids like the show they'll like the DVD. I think there are two shows on the DVD with a few extras. I bought it so my kids could watch it in the car and it works great.,1174694400,2,175,3.5128205128205128
2679011,5,B000JSI618,"My 22 month old absolutely LOVES this DVD.  She carries it around with her everywhere (the case has a cute handle).  Although I don't like my daughter to watch too much TV and I am not an advocate of the ""TV as a babysitter"" idea, I am a big fan of this particular program.  Hi-5 encourages movement, physical activity, and singing while teaching their young audience about colors, moods, animals, etc.  The cast is a group of high-energy, upbeat, professionally-trained vocalists (many of whom have appeared on Broadway) who really relate to children.  Your child will not be able to sit still while watching - I often find my daughter trying to mimic the characters and she loves when other little children are show.  This DVD is the equivalent to 3 TV-length Hi-5 shows.  My only warning would be that these songs are REALLY catchy and you will find yourself humming them even when your child isn't around.",1174176000,2,909,4.715189873417722

George is only 16 months old but he has watched Hi-5 since before age 1 and copies all the moves, and dances and sings to it. When he opened the video, we didn't even think he would realize what it was. He put his hand up in the air and yelled Hi-5 with the biggest smile in the world. When we played it, his parents commented that it had a lot more material than the TV show and showed considerbly more interaction with the children. George was mesmerized.
