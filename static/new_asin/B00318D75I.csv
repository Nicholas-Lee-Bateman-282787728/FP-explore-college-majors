8386760,4,B00318D75I,"An interesting look at natural disasters, including tornadoes, avalanches, earthquakes, wildfire and floods. Some of the re-inactments were a bit hokey and some of the footage wasn't as high quality as I would have liked, but overall the quality was high enough to be very interesting. The program includes some great interviews and interesting information we didn't know before. And a lot of the footage is fabulous.

It is a bit long for young viewers. I broke it up into two viewings for my twin 7-year-old sons, who loved it and couldn't wait to watch the second half the following night.",1455580800,,592,4.861386138613861
