4896798,4,B005V4X92Q,"I found this video to be really well shot.  The CGI was above average.  But like the title says, I have this video on my Xbox and got it for free.  If you have the Xbox Live membership, you can find the whole video and save it on your Xbox.",1352073600,,240,3.76
4896799,5,B005V4X92Q,"Absolutely fascinating!! Watched it several times, took it to my grandson to show him and my son-in-law watched it too. They LOVED it. I wished it had been a full blown movie, it was so exciting to watch. Better than just about any movie or TV show out there. HOlYWOOD (NOT hollywod) needs to pay attention to shows like this, they could certainly use these peoples expertise in making a good movie!!!!!!",1346025600,,404,4.625
4896800,4,B005V4X92Q,"Be forewarned, this is not a full-featured film.  It is, however, 20 minutes worth of absolutely awesome futuristic action.  Attention to detail is stellar.  Feels like you're looking 10 or 20 years into the future and seeing what it might be like for an elite squad fighting out an individual mission.  The film makers obviously tried hard to be as realistic as possible.

Now they just need to do a full feature film.  Please!",1342310400,,428,4.716216216216216
4896801,3,B005V4X92Q,"This movie was really good, but way to short and I agree with the other reviewer, there was no real value in it. It was too short to be a paid product, but maybe too expensive to make to give away.  When you are trying to sell a $50 video game, this could have been given away with the game.  The bottom line...Do not pay for this and watch it on the internet because I sure it will be up on the companies website soon. Especially since the PC version of the game has not received good reviews, anyway.  Looks like they dumped all their resources into the movie and not the game.  Don't believe the hype.  LOL.",1341360000,2,610,4.135593220338983
4896802,5,B005V4X92Q,"Exciting, superbly directed prequel to ""Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon:Future Soldier"" single/multiplayer video game. This movie gives incite and perspective to the upcoming addition to the Ghost Recon franchise.  Well done!",1338422400,,218,6.266666666666667
4896803,5,B005V4X92Q,"I have UK dvd players not region free machines, and just got my copy from DHL and it worked! I am very pleased to find that it works outside of NTSC players.

I am unsure as to what happened to the price I paid $9.96 its now $9.49 & $9.99 for post, no UK release for some reason even though there is no region encoding on the disc.

I have noticed some talking about it not being a worthwhile purchase due to being able to watch it online free free, well free has compression it won't be the same as the quality output from a disc though its a shame they they only recorded it in 2.1 surround and not 5.1 or even 7.1. You also miss out on the bonus making of feature that is longer than the main feature for some reason.

I have personally met a few who worked on this short so I've purchased this for that reason.

REGION FREE DVD - Import and it will work, no one has confirmed this so I'm going to be first to say Ubisoft sell direct outside of US to help with delivery costs.",1338249600,,979,4.005128205128205
4896804,1,B005V4X92Q,"I didn't know what this was when I rented it but thought it looked good according to the description, Until 20 minutes in and oopps its over. How disapointing. This is not a movie this is some college kids idea of a short film with exellent special effects. If it would have been a full featured film I would have given it a full five stars but as it is I feel like I got robbed. Just about the point you fall into the storyline behind the game and film it all ends. What a let down. I don't think I will buy the games or rent any more of these films if they come out with more.",1337990400,,578,3.906779661016949
4896805,5,B005V4X92Q,"This short was an amazing video to watch, great prequel. The effects were nothing short of mind blowing along with the action. Of course this video is free on Zune along with Xbox 360 Dashboard, so I was really able to see it a few weeks ago. This purchase is really just for the dedicated Ghost Recon fan.",1337644800,,306,4.293103448275862
4896806,4,B005V4X92Q,"Don't expect a full length movie. This is a snipet type teaser film. It was very cool to watch.
The action was well done. Futuristic but it came off very realistic somehow. I would have paid to go see this as a full length feature film. It would be a great movie. My only problem is the continuation of the same old kill the minority first mind game U.S film has portrayed since it started. That is LAME and obviously comes from pen** envy. Grow up directors all ready. Other than that pretty good flick.",1337212800,,504,4.315789473684211
4896807,3,B005V4X92Q,"AN explanation of Uplay first for those that don't know. Uplay is a rewards site (of sorts) for Ubisoft, who puts out the Ghost Recon games. Being a member and earning Achievements and/or Trophies (for XB360 and PS3 respectively) gives you UPlay credits for unlocking content within supported games and downloading special content when available. It also allows for special things such as seeing this before the retail release.

 Now onto the ""movie"", if one could call it that, it's more of a short film, at 23 to 24 minutes (minus the credits). I'll spare you the description for the sake of padding this out, you can find it above. Instead I'll give my impressions. Short and sweet.. it was pretty good for a tie in short film. However the 24 minute run time allowed for just an infiltration and shootout, no real time for any story or character setup. The future gear was used.. not sparingly.. but realistically. Soldiering came first, which was impressive. The gun-play was good, minus the whistle suppressor sound the drone makes, which is a cardinal sin of Hollywood gun sounds. This probably wasn't supervised by the guys at Red Storm Entertainment, who handle the Foley sounds for the guns.

 All in all, this was worth watching for free as a UPlay member, but I wouldn't buy this unless you're wanting to spend the $10 for a companion piece to sit next to your copy of Future Soldier (if you buy it that is).",1336780800,3,1419,4.686746987951807

4896819,2,B005V4X92Q,The service was great - The Product was not what I expected - It was not a dvd movie about a recon team but an advertisement for some silly game.  If you ar looking for a movie don't buy,1425427200,,186,3.769230769230769
4896820,1,B005V4X92Q,Save your money. This is nothing more then an extended trailer. If it were a book it would only be about 30 pages long.,1418342400,,119,4.0
4896821,1,B005V4X92Q,is just a short film that is cool but not worth the miney,1417824000,,57,3.4615384615384617

4896824,3,B005V4X92Q,"this ""movie"" was shot well, very exciting, and the action/special effects were nearly unparalleled, but it was only twenty minutes long and ended on an unsatisfying cliffhanger.  worth seeing, but not really worth the price of  new bluray combo pack.  ps.  it is live action, not animation as stated in description.",1397174400,,315,5.117647058823529
4896825,1,B005V4X92Q,It was not worth the money and was only 30 minutes or so.  It was a prequel not a movie,1395878400,,87,3.35

4896827,2,B005V4X92Q,great 20 min intro to the game....now if they would actually complete the movie for us non-gamers would be great....so unless you are a gamer...would not recommend you waist your money for this video....,1389225600,,203,5.0
