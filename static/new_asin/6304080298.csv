Anita Mui, who leads the cast, is billed as the Madonna of Asia which is an  insult. I like Madonna, but the only comparison is their outrageous stage  costumes. Mui is as good a singer, although in a lower range, and can  really act, something she doesn't get to do in this movie.
This movie is  a comic book with women heroes, and it is a great comic book. It only makes  sense to you if comic books or avant garde films make sense. You don""t  watch it for a great story, but for three top notch actresses, and some  great wire work.

779836,4,6304080298,"It's hard to believe Johnnie To, the gritty crime director, Hong Kong's Martin Scorsese, directed this campy, superhero movie. This is a very early film of his, and might not play well with viewers who are more accustomed to Johnnie To's more recent films: Election, P.T.U., Exiled, etc. Heroic Trio is more like an mindless action movie, a Mummy meets Charlie's Angels type film. That said Johnnie To's talent isn't fully wasted here. To his credit, like most good directors, he does a great job of making his stars  (Michelle Yeoh, Maggie Cheung, and Anita Miu), look cool and sexy. Johnnie To has an A-list female cast here and takes full advantage of it. Michelle Yeoh is particularly appealing in this movie, as her sex appeal is emphasized, which is unusual as she's always portrayed in movies as more of a stoic, virtuous woman. So, I would say, if you're in the mood for a silly, campy action film with a lot of eye candy and want to see a great director's early efforts this is a movie you should try.",1365465600,,1010,4.580110497237569

I can understand why a dubbed version would be sold, but why not have the original language (Mandarin, or Cantonese) as well?  I cannot address whether or not this version is also cut, as some versions have been in the past, but the running time is 86 minutes.  Perhaps Miramax/Echo Bridge should change their slogan to ""The entertainment alternative for those"" who don't mind us determining what they want to see.

779841,4,6304080298,"Oh, boy, does this film bring back memories. In The Heroic Trio(1992, Tong Fong Saam Hap), Dong(Anita Mui), Ching(Michelle Yeoh), and Thief Catcher(Maggie Cheung) team up to rescue kidnapped babies from a powerful eunuch(Yen Shi Kwan). TV stations in the 1990's showed Hong Kong movies when Jackie Chan, John Woo, Michelle Yeoh, Jet Li, Sammo Hung, and many others were working in Hollywood. Keep in mind that there's a US English dubbed DVD version from Miramax. It's cut by 10 minutes and it changes the names of characters. It also changes much of the dialouge. It also uses instrumental versions of Cantonese pop songs and a Charlie's Angels style credits sequence. One will either love or hate The Heroic Trio. It's jam-packed with blood and guts. The film borrows ideas from The Terminator(1984), Superman(1978), and Shaw Brothers kung fu films such as The Flying Guillotine(1974). William Wu composed a solid music score for the film. Johnny To directs and the action scenes are staged by Ching Siu Tung. Clips from The Heroic Trio can be seen in the French art house movie Irma Vep(1996). The Heroic Trio uses a lot of old school style special effects. Piano wires are used to make actors float or fly. It uses stop animation and sets rigged to collapse or explode. Around 1998 or so, Hong Kong filmmakers started making movies with larger budgets, glossy sets, photogenic costumes and CGI. I remember watching The Heroic Trio on a 19 inch UHF TV set that I got for Christmas in 1996.
The Heroic Trio(1992) is a keeper. The adventure continues in Executioners(1993).",1311206400,3,1574,4.898876404494382

Synopsis: Join Shadow Fox (Anita Mui), Invisible Woman (Michelle Yeoh) and Mercy the Thief Catcher (Maggie Cheung) as they unite forces to do battle with an emissary of evil with supernatural powers dwelling in a Hades-like world created beneath the city. Newborn male children are disappearing into the shadowy Underworld below, nineteen at last count and the heroic trio is the only force that may be able to bring an end to the abductions and destroy the supernatural wizard who intends pick a new king from amongst the children and use the rest as demonic killers to do his bidding. Can three femme fatales succeed in their almost impossible mission? What do you think?

Critique: The '92 Hong Kong release `The Heroic Trio' is a mixed bag containing a combination of occasional comedic elements, cheesy melodrama and adequate martial arts sequences all used to counterbalance some surprising and unexpectedly harsh, even grotesque scenes involving the deaths of some of the young ones that will more than likely disturb some in the viewing audience. Fortunately you have the choice of bypassing these darker portions of the film by viewing the American release which has cut them out. However if you're one of those viewer like myself who likes to watch a film in its original language without the additional editing get the -Region 0- import and enjoy!

One more thing before I close, I'd like to answer the question posited in my title for this review. Yes Maggie (Mercy) your face is most definitely still looking good!

Don't watch this movie expecting something of the caliber of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon; you'll be disappointed.  An obvious take-off of stories like The Three Musketeers and with a mood similar to the Batman movies, this film is often confusing and melodramatic, at times simply absurd.

779919,3,6304080298,"Proud to say that I do own the Tai Seng release of this DVD.  That itself is a good thing because it doesn't have the garbage sound actors, the good stuff isn't edited, and what's the point of seeing this movie if you're not seeing it the way it should be?
But, I will say that if you do decide to pick up this movie, first, look for the Tai Seng release of it.  Though it is out of print, it is still around in places.
If you can't, then, fall down to the ""mouse"" and pick this copy up.
A little about the movie: It was influenced by the movie ""Batman,"" and the directors (Ching Siu Tung & Johnny To) liked it so much, they wanted to make a film just lke that.  And, how can you go wrong with Michelle Yeoh, Maggie Chung and Anita Mui?  You truly can't.
I would have given this movie 4 stars, but, seeing I'm not too big a fan of what Disney did to this version, I can only give it a 3.  Horrid dubbing and editing so obvious to those that have seen the original.
Disney, as well as all the other movie studios, you need to stop cutting and dubbing the Asian films - you do a horrible job.  Leave it the way it was supposed to be, and give us the subtitles instead.",1086307200,2,1166,3.9615384615384617
779920,5,6304080298,"I realize that this may be an acquired taste which only means that even if you have not acquired this taste then you are still required to admit that this film is absolutely, positively, hands down funtastic.
Duh, I'm not even sure which page I'm on; if this is the Americanized version or not. I own the true blue Hong Kong edition which is supposed to contain some flippin' freaky scenes edited out of the American version. I've seen both but cannot remember because, oh, blar!, never mind.....
Back to the movie: ""Heroic Trio"" stars three of Hong Kong's mightiest screen queens as superheroes. Michelle Yeoh plays Invisible Girl who can become, well, invisible and really kick some bad man fanny, Anita Mui plays Wonder Woman who is quite different from the Amazonian Wonder Woman but just as effective, and Maggie Cheung is the streetwise little Thief Catcher who drives a mean motorcycle and carries an arsenal of nasty toys. Despite some personal differences the three gang together to track down the rotten evil doer who is `napping poor little innocent babes to fulfill his fiendish scheme. The special effects and action scenes are psycho-silly wild yet the atmosphere is dark and moody with just enough bitter-sweetness to snap a heartstring or two.
A note on Michelle Yeoh: I don't understand Hollywood for seemingly tossing her aside after sticking her in one James Bond flick. Miss Yeoh is the best female action star around; we see Jackie here and there and Jet everywhere, but where oh where is Michelle? This woman has got the goods (my martial arts instructor Saul-Yu Lingstein will back me on this 100%), yet Hollywood stupidly persists in casting flashy young starlets who don't know kung-fu from King Kong from Donkey Kong from a horse's patootie.

779961,2,6304080298,The bad editing turned me off to this movie. I didn't need to see the wires to know that they were using them. Thru the whole movie I spotted items that should have been edited out.,1078617600,,181,4.055555555555555
779962,3,6304080298,"Starring Anita Mui ('Rumble In The Bronx'), Michelle Yeoh ('Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon') and Maggie Cheung ('In The Mood For Love') as three crime-fighting superheroines in Hong Kong's answer to Gotham City, 'The Heroic Trio' is a high-kicking, crimson-soaked comic book action romp that could only come out of our favourite country for hi-octane beat-em-ups. As you might have guessed, it's hardly Oscar-winning stuff; the plot is at times incomprehensible, the sets cheap and the acting camp, but it all adds to the charm. This is, after all, not a film to be analysed, but enjoyed with popcorn on a Friday night. And, as that, it succeeds - the action sequences are very exciting, the wire work is well done, the original score is superb and, of course, our three leading ladies light up the screen at every turn. But those weak in the knee may wish to turn away at certain points as it does get a tad grisley at times, what with decapitations, exploding body parts, cannibalism and baby-murdering. Indeed, the violence is so over-the-top at times that it becomes not so much offensive as it does laughable. Which was probably the idea.
So while the movie itself is recommended, Buena Vista's DVD release definitely isn't. The Disney company has once again seen fit to edit yet another Asian movie for its Western market - this time by three minutes to remove the aforementioned gory moments. And, as expected, the original Cantonese soundtrack has been replaced with a dreadful English dub and generic score - denying us the pleasure of hearing Anita Mui's two excellent songs. Still, this is what we've come to expect from the distributor that seems to delight in infuriating hardcore Chinese film fans. Those wishing to own the uncut version of the film would be advised to seek out the 'Universe' DVD from Hong Kong or the now out-of-print 'Tai Seng' American release. Better still (if you have PAL/Region 2 capabilities), waiting for the forthcoming remastered Special Edition from British DVD label 'Hong Kong Legends' would be the ideal solution.",1061078400,53,2060,4.956647398843931

Though it has been compared to Charlie's Angels, this is much more a comic book fantasy, and if you accept it on the level of Batman or Spiderman, then you'll do just fine.  My only complaint is that the women have an amazing ability to recover from their injuries.  And the last line is a hoot; after accessorizing their outfits with capes, the one says, ""The press are coming; we have to look good."" (!!)  If only more of the dialogue was that goofy.

Disney/Miramax do this with ALL of their DVD releases of Hong Kong classics, which they have more or less monopolized the rights to in terms of US distribution. I wouldn't mind so much if they would simply release the movies as they were intended to be seen -- but this is ridiculous. The changes are all completely unnecessary. Thanks for nothing, Miramax. Harvey Weinstein fails to realize that nobody -- NOBODY -- who truly likes and wishes to own a movie like The Heroic Trio is going to prefer a heavily cut down, edited, altered version, once they realize that is what they are getting. So pointless. Anybody who values asian cinema at all should avoid buying any foreign films from Disney/Miramax/Buena Vista. A lot of American distributors are guilty of these practices, but some are helping improvements along -- for instance, Columbia TriStar's domestic release of the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" trilogy is perfectly satisfactory. It is in its original widescreen ratio, uncut, with its original score and audio tracks; clear subtitles are offered, as well as an English dubbed version for those so inclined. Is such a basic package really asking so much?
When it comes to this particular movie, I recommend seeking out an import version if you are going to purchase it. The import versions have failings of their own, but at least you'll see the COMPLETE movie as it was intended to be seen.",1045440000,13,1583,4.823529411764706

The film has furious fight scenes that are of the calibre that  EVERY comic book movie should sport--Marvel Comics kept popping into my  mind--interesting costumes (with the amusing fact that the 'Invisible Girl'  is the only character in the film who isn't dressed in muted colours or  black), nice character interplays (even though the characters are rather  thin), and is just a fun ride overall. To make it even better, the  lighting, camera work, and set design are all perfect... all serving to  underscore the 'film noir cool' tone of the film.
On the purely technical  front, I really appreciated the subtitling of this film. Not only did they  not use the annoying white lettering that is the standard--they used yellow  which never got lost against the images on the screen--but they let the  subtitling run onto the black bar left by the wide-screen formatting. The  translation job was also excellent, with none of the bizarre,  unintentionally funny turns of phrase that one occassionally sees when the  translations are a bit too literal.
This would be a Five Star movie if it  didn't suffer from a common problem among 'B-movies' of this type. The  pacing seems off in many places, as a little too much time is spent  dwelling on cool camera effects and characters striking 'poster poses' than  is healthy for the movie.
Still, I recommend it for anyone who likes  superhero movies and/or the Hong Kong school of action flicks.",951782400,9,1672,4.9035714285714285

It's one of my favorites.  From the lines that jumped  straight from comic books to the wires holding people in the air, The  Herioc Trio had me laughing all the way.  I really enjoyed it.",948931200,,361,3.9305555555555554

7861626,1,6304080298,"OK, Firstly several reviewers have talked about a severely cut movie. I have both the Tai Seng and the Miramax releases and both are close to the run time listed in IMDB.  On the down side:

The Tai Seng release has a 1.85:1AR EMBEDDED in a 4:3 frame so horrible black bars on all 4 sides. The transfer quality is not that good.  On the plus side the audio is Cantonese but the subtitles are hard fixed and in Cantonese and English. Having Asian characters above the English text is appalling.

As for the Miramax release, the AR is a proper 1:85:1 and the transfer is better quality BUT the audio is only dubbed English. Yuck. Does have English subs.

I also notice a Echo release but it states 1.33:1 AR so again not good.

I guess hard core fans  could buy both the Miramax and Tai Seng releases. RIP the video and subs from the Miramax and the audio from the Tai Seng and combine.  So long as you don't share it then legally any prosecution would be hard pushed to build a case.",1401840000,2,982,4.27027027027027

7861629,5,6304080298,I LOVE action movies and I've been looking for this movie in DVD. I have this in VHS and I wanted to replace that for DVD. This movie is hard to find and sometime when you look somewhere else it cost more. The price for this DVD was just right. Also the shipping was fast and it arrive on time. Love it! If you like action movie or girls fight then this is a good movie to watch.,1373328000,,379,3.871794871794872
