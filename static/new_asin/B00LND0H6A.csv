8666868,4,B00LND0H6A,"Pretty good history and a fairly accurate portrayal of the 1920's warfare of the period. Kind of a sappy story though. If you like military history or are a fan of the Russian Civil War, you'll love it. If your looking for personal narratives, love stories, etc,  I would suggest passing on it.",1532736000,,294,4.547169811320755
8666869,4,B00LND0H6A,Too much drama and the fighting seemed very B film. Still a great watch though if you are in to Polish films!,1505779200,,109,4.0
8666870,5,B00LND0H6A,"An EXCELLENT movie about a topic that has been much neglected. May Poland enjoy God's favor and save Europe today, as she did yesterday.",1504483200,,136,4.708333333333333

The good: Story, pacing and action are all good. The music ties in very nicely. Older poles will remember the songs (including the soviet ones). Very watchable movie for Poles or non-Poles.

The not-so-good: Some of the history and culture of the time are subtle and maybe lost on viewers not familiar with the overall context. The real life history is fascinating and deserves more attention then an action/costume movie can give it (a historical documentary companion disk would have been amazing.). My only complaint with the movie is that the personal story of the characters is lost toward the end. You lose track who is where and why and where the battle lines are. A few tricks (like showing animated maps or something) could have remedied this. This is a minor nit-pick.

If you want to watch a war movie set in a different setting about history that is seldom mentioned or remembered in the West, this is a one of the better movies out there.",1500249600,,1096,4.697916666666667

8666877,5,B00LND0H6A,"Great movie, but the version I bought, which stated that it would play on all players DIDN'T ... it only played on my computer and only because it had the windows 7 version of windows media player ... so BEWARE ... I needed an NTSC version and it didn't play ... otherwise its a great movie, but be forwarned if you think this will play on an NTSC blueray or dvd player, it won't ... and it also won't do subtitles on windows 10...",1454025600,,431,4.142857142857143
