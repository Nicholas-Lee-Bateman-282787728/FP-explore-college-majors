8640355,5,B00CQ80JDW,"The original series starring Richard Armitage and Andrew Lincoln was masterful. As Mr Armitage put in in an interview, there may be a  whole lot of special effects, explosions and the like, but there are stories and character developments within all the noise, that compels one to engage from the very beginning. Richard is a heroic figure, a brilliant actor, with a commanding voice and manner, and perfect for this role. I have watched all 6 episodes over and over. I will watch anything Mr Armitage is in, because he makes everything he touches turn to gold!",1416787200,5,561,4.783505154639175
