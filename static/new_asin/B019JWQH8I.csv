7576261,3,B019JWQH8I,"Not bad, but not great either. Its a good solid 3 stars movie.",1476403200,,62,3.8461538461538463

7576264,2,B019JWQH8I,It had hope...but it fell apart during first half hour or so..finished up...but overall ..it could have been more..but...acting was subpar...and whatever happened to good movies?!?!?...It seems tv..series has all the talent and watch worthiness....haven't seen a good movie in a long time....,1475971200,,292,5.813953488372093
7576265,4,B019JWQH8I,"For some reason, I love movies set in the snow.  Everything looks beautiful, but you know how dangerous that beauty can be.  This movie quickly gets into displaying the negative character traits, so one can decide who the baddies are.  Then they just as quickly start dying off.  This revenge plot twist can be figured out fairly quickly, but it is still exciting enough.  I was impressed with all of the acting and several folks did an excellent job.  All around enjoyable.",1475884800,2,474,4.719512195121951
7576266,4,B019JWQH8I,"This movie was far better than I expected. Decent job on every front, with only minor issues throughout. Was sort of a modern take on ""The Most Dangerous Game"", with a bit more gore and a few plot holes.

The film has a fantastic set up, but falters a bit in the latter half.

Despite its flaws I was entertained. The acting, cinematography, score, and overall story was good, not groundbreaking or amazing, but better than most indie fare.

SPOILER WARNING!!!!
In fact, the ending was downright terrible, with plot holes and odd choices throughout. So much more could've been done but it seemed as though the writer(s) felt like they had to keep ramping the pace up only to jump the shark about halfway through. The ""big twist"" at the end was all too predictable.",1475539200,,764,4.602941176470588

7576285,3,B019JWQH8I,"Now the movie is okay to watch.  The plot is entertaining enough to keep your interest, but nothing very original.  There are plenty of summaries so I will not do this, but the movie's downfall in my opinion, is that very few of the characters are likable.  When something horrible happens to a character you are supposed to feel something and this is supposed to engage you more-- love, hate, anxiety, empathy, etc.  Instead you feel kind of ambiguous.  There are minor plot twists but not worth mentioning.

If you like the type of film where the characters are battling the elements, the wilderness, as well as hunting or being hunted, then you will probably take a favorable look to this.",1478563200,3,692,4.677685950413223
7576286,1,B019JWQH8I,I hate subtitles and the description never mentions subtitles.  I was deceived and deceived!!!,1478304000,,94,5.714285714285714

7576290,3,B019JWQH8I,"Garbage movie ... but occasionally fun. The beginning tricks you into thinking it might be a quality film ... because some scenery bits are filmed with a drone, no doubt. But while the plot unfolds, there are many breaks in motivation and logic, leading to unrealistic action.

Kudos, though, for doing what so many big budget Hollywood movies don't do ... actually filming an outdoor movie outdoors, in the cold. That's why I give 3 stars, instead of 1.",1477872000,,454,4.746835443037975
7576291,1,B019JWQH8I,Stupid gory garbage. Probably great if you are about 14 years old.,1477785600,,66,4.583333333333333
7576292,2,B019JWQH8I,Very few quality moments,1477699200,,24,5.25
7576293,3,B019JWQH8I,story line and acting was actually good but the blood scenes were a bit over done and unrealistic.,1477612800,,98,4.5

7576295,5,B019JWQH8I,"I wasn't expecting much, but this was actually pretty good.  One of the characters was so annoying that it was almost to the point of being unrealistic (but then I ended up rooting for him to survive).  And the variety of unique characters was actually one of the movie's strong points.  I'd recommend it highly!",1477526400,,312,4.636363636363637

8745416,4,B019JWQH8I,not to bad. some gore. ending could of been better.,1528934400,,51,4.2
8745417,3,B019JWQH8I,"I liked the idea of the movie and being in the woods during winter time. There was enough action to keep me interested for a bit, when it came to the ""gore"" factor there wasn't a lot of that. There was a little violence sprinkled here and there throughout the movie but nothing to write home about or over the top. Overall a decent movie if you're looking for something half fun to watch. Ending was pretty much par for this type of movie about half way through you could figure out what's going on.",1516665600,,499,4.2631578947368425
8745418,1,B019JWQH8I,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Terrible writing and ridiculous plot. The best scene is at the end when the credits finally rolled. Had some potential but was completely ruined by a bad script. Perhaps another good scene was when one of the characters throws a rock at the most annoying character. Too bad he didn't get knocked out for the rest of the film. Suffering from PTSD now after watching this. Tell everyone you meet to not watch this. You're welcome.,1502582400,,479,4.517241379310345

8745420,5,B019JWQH8I,"I am giving 5 to balance out the unfair reviews here. OK so it's not the greatest film and the acting was tepid but it did have some plot twists and and it was not at all ""predictable""  as one reviewer said.  It had enough to keep it interesting.  Not just a slasher and gore film.",1501372800,,281,3.982142857142857
8745421,4,B019JWQH8I,Not a top notch movie but enjoyed it. Acting was better than I thought it would be. Would possibly watch again.,1500508800,,111,4.333333333333333

8745423,2,B019JWQH8I,"Bad acting, trite and predictable plot, horrible choreography, next town 216 miles away, really??? trudging back and forth over same locations, derelict, abandoned house with electricity conveniently left running and working lamps galore, they walk into a barn when it's pitch dark and walk out minutes later into bright sunshine, argh!",1496102400,,336,5.607843137254902
