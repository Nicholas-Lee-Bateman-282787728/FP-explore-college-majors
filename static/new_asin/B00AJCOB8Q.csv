8552493,2,B00AJCOB8Q,"Not happy. I like both of these moviea a lot. I was mainly buying the set because of dinner for schmucks; however, the movie skips throughout. Sometimes the skips are to the point of having to skip the entire scene. I didn't drop scratch or smudge the disc. I cleaned the dvd player,  and the diac and I still get the same problem. Now because I didn't have time to watch the movie before the return window I am stuck with a dud of a movie. I love you man worka great though.",1400457600,,475,4.10752688172043

It's healthy to be able to silly up.. These movies are best enjoyed with Homemade popcorn, Not the microwavey kind.. LOL",1385769600,,288,4.433962264150943
