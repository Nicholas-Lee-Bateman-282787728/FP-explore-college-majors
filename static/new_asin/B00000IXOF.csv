1230202,3,B00000IXOF,"I enjoy this workout, but I can see problems with it.  There isn't much of a warm up or cool down.  There are three different cardio sections and an ab section.  There is no cool down for the cardio sections, so you go from a high heartrate and then it starts another section with tai chi.  There are also times that Tracey is off or does the wrong move and it could be confusing.
Besides that, I really like the moves and it gets my heartrate up, I can get over the other things and warm up/cool down on my own.",1052784000,8,512,4.03960396039604
1230203,2,B00000IXOF,"I am sorry, but this was one of the WORST workout videos I have ever tried!
Lets forget the fact that there is basically NO warm-up. The instructor is beyond annoying and the only thing I felt that was anywhere NEAR worthwhile on the tape was the abs workout. A return ...for me...",1049846400,3,281,4.320754716981132
1230204,4,B00000IXOF,"Yes - when my husband saw me doing this video, he said - ""she's a power-puff girl!"" Well, I was sweating from head to toe and told him to do the power-puff workout then! :) He tried some of the ab exercises Tracy has at the end during the cool-down, and he couldn't do more than 10 reps of the ""frog""! hahaha. Well, I think this video is great -- Tracy does have a very upbeat and perky (power-puff girl-sounding) voice, but she is a very good instructor, clearly describing the moves beforehand and going through them slowly once and then speeing up into the workout. The tape has 3 workouts - each increasing in intensity -- and all together, they are a really good workout. The only thing that I would like to have more of would be a tougher arm workout -- but it is still a good one. After a while, if you workout regularly, the workout becomes pretty easy since you know what's coming next. But, I still opted for it over some of my tougher workout videos - for that very reason. My sister-in-law came to visit us and she worked out with it and took it home with her! So, now I have to get another one! :)",1023148800,10,1110,4.191588785046729
1230205,5,B00000IXOF,"I first started with Tae-Bo due to all of the infomercials and it truly  looked like a great program. Don't get me wrong I really enjoy doing Tae-Bo  and Billy Blanks is a very inspirational instructor but..
Jab, Kick, and  Burn is more dancy and better choreographed than Tae-Bo. I find the  exercises are easy to learn and the instruction pretty good.  Another  benefit of the video is that it is broken into 3 different intensity  segments each about 15 mins in length! If you have a hectic life and have  to exercise in a hurry, this is the video for you!",968803200,14,559,4.411764705882353
1230206,2,B00000IXOF,"This video does get your heart pumping and makes you sweat, however,it's  not really about jabbing and kicking but more about satisfying your  ""inner being"" and suppressing ""negative energy"".  The  live percussion band made it harder for me to get involved, I prefer cheesy  workout music any day. I was expecting a more hard-core kickboxing workout,  but this was more of a yoga/tai chi video. I would recommend Kathy Smith's  kickboxing video if you want a serious workout.",968112000,5,475,5.012820512820513
1230207,5,B00000IXOF,"I, for one, am sick of the same old boring aerobics.  I use the Method tapes on a regular basis and I use this particular tape frequently.  It's a great break-away from the usual Tae-Bo moves. Great choregraphy, cuing,  music, and I love Tracey Mallett.  Fabulous workout.",958435200,4,272,4.723404255319149

7911598,1,B00000IXOF,I was really disappointed with this video. It arrived in excellent condition and quickly but the video workout was not good. I've done a lot of Tracy's videos and love her. I've also don't cardio kickboxing videos and found this one very difficult to follow and not a great sweat. I'm glad I only paid a couple dollars for it.,1440201600,,326,4.45

7911600,5,B00000IXOF,This dvd is perfect for a beginner or advanced workout.  The plyometric moves help you to burn fat in record time.,1327449600,,114,4.428571428571429

7911602,4,B00000IXOF,"If you are not familiar with THE METHOD series: there are several teammates, a live percussion group, and movements are dance and Pilates inspired. This workout is broken down into 3 ""intensities"".  Kicking and dance moves are combined. Not for beginner because kickboxing and dance moves are challenging and fast paced.",1164844800,,320,5.2745098039215685
7911603,5,B00000IXOF,"Loved this workout! I liked that the instructor Tracey Mallett broke down the moves slowly then picked up the pace. I always get a good sweat going and feel like I've worked the whole body.

Tracey is very upbeat which keeps me going and I love her accent, I also work out to ""Cardio Bootcamp"" which she is the star of and I switch off ecah day with them and I'm already down a size after a month.  Perfect workout for beginners.",1123286400,,429,4.219512195121951
7911604,5,B00000IXOF,"Tracey Mallet is energizing and fun to watch. There are 3 segments on this tape, the first is mostly for beginners, and goes fairly slow with kicks and punches. The second section gets your heart rate up and is fun. The third section gets you sweating and out of breath but it is SO MUCH FUN! After I am done I feel like I've accomplished a great task.

There is a lot of jumping around and squats/plie's so if you have bad knees, stay away. If you are looking for a fun cardio workout that tones and burns, this is it!",1109289600,4,519,4.138613861386139
7911605,3,B00000IXOF,"Jab, Kick & Burn is a kickboxing workout which consists of three 14-minute kickboxing segments followed by a 10-minute abs-focused cool-down.  British instructor Tracey Mallet has a high energy level and Barbie-like good looks; she definitely seems to be having fun during the workouts and encourages you to do the same.

The first kickboxing section was my favorite.  After a brief warm-up which includes some slightly dance-y moves, Tracey moves on to some kicking drills.  She then continues with some slow and controlled combos which were fun but which didn't raise my hear rate much, but the second half of the workout includes more jumping and increased cardio intensity.  Although Tracey's cueing was sometimes a bit off, I was able to follow her in this workout.  In the second and third workouts, however, the choreography was much more complex, and I found Tracey's cueing to be less than adequate.  She began teaching each new combination slowly at first, but she does a lot of ""take-it-from-the-top"" instruction, and she frequently fails to cue things like number of repetitions, sequence changes, and left-right.  Both workouts contain plenty of kicking:  the second workout ends with a series of front kicks, and the third contains a segment which Tracey refers to as ""chicometrics"":  basically, squats with a knee lift or kick and then a jump to the reverse side.  There is no cool-down at all to the third kickboxing segment.

The final abs segment begins with Pilates-type movements, including a bent knee roll-up, toe dips, the frog, and crunches; there are then a few seated stretches such as a spine stretch forward.  During the three kickboxing segments, there are several live drummers on stage, and Tracey instructs a class of approximately 6-8 others, but in the abs cool-down, Tracey works out alone to softer background music.  I would definitely not recommend this video for those new to kickboxing, as there is no instruction on form and many of the moves are difficult to follow.  This workout would probably be best suited to those who are familiar with the basics of kickboxing and who prefer complex, dance-y choreography.",1096243200,8,2154,5.062322946175637
7911606,2,B00000IXOF,"This is a good video if you are not trying to loose weight and if you are already fit and trim, but If you have any weight on you at all you're not going to enjoy this video.
 I thought that I would try this video after mastering Dance to Fitness. I could definitely keep up with this video, but I found myself wanting something slower. There's no room for adapting the moves to any physical problems (ex. bad knees), and because of that I found the constant jumping and changing in the video to be awful.
There is no variety in the routine. I there is no warmup and no instruction on how to properly do the moves in this video without injury. That coupled with the pace of this video put me in enough pain to know that this was a Chiropractic nightmare.
This video struck me as being more for the perfect body crowd than for those who wanted a careful and well put together workout. Once again I think that a smaller, lighter person would definitely enjoy this video, but for me. Coming from the gentle-sweeping movements of Dance Aerobics, Tai Chi to this was a bone jarring, painful mistake. I would take The Methods Dance To Fitness over this any day.",1075248000,4,1155,4.347222222222222
