388164,4,6301965698,Fred Astaire and Vera Ellen dancing literally in New York by special effects. He's so much in love that he literally floats in the air and starts dancing! The story can be dull at times but the dancing makes up for  that.,956707200,3,221,4.261904761904762
7818047,2,6301965698,2 for the sharp color. The film dreadful. What was Fred thinking!  Vera disappointing and not her fault - think White Christmas and Call Me Madam. Fred Astaire had the reputation for perfection so don't know what happened here. And Arthur Freed his name on a musical guaranteed a great show not this one! So save your money. I wa so disappointed. ,1451779200,,347,4.580645161290323
7818048,5,6301965698,"As musicals go there are much better ones out there. The thing with this movie is really the stars. Fred Astaire needs no introduction, he was a master and screen wonder. He could do it all and people rightly love him. Vera-Ellen on the other hand is not that well known. She came on the scene about 10 years too late for real musical stardom. That said she is simply one of the finest dancers to ever strap on a pair of toe shoes. She was an exquisite talent and a beautiful woman. It is a shame she never got the acclaim she deserved. So, not the best musical but a fine showcase for two of the very best dancers in the movies.",1444867200,,629,4.121951219512195
7818049,5,6301965698,"The Belle Of New York was eleased in 1952. Fred Astaire starred  in this fun musical. Alice Pearce provides gret support. Fred Astaire fans, and lovers of film musicals, will like this the most.",1417824000,,194,4.705882352941177

7818051,2,6301965698,"Arthur Freed, the great producer of MGM musicals, must have been sick or on vacation during the filming of The Belle of New York. The terrible script, inferior music and lyrics should have sounded an alarm, but no one was there to here it. Only the dance numbers are worth anything. Everything else is beneath contempt. It's hard to believe that Freed would allow its release. If ever a picture needed a fix, it was this dud. Alas, no one saved it. What a waste of Fred Astaire,Vera Ellen, Alice Pearce, Conrad Salinger and director Charles Walters.",1348790400,,549,4.670103092783505
7818052,5,6301965698,"Vera Ellen is no Ginger, but none the less, a very suitable dancing partner for Fred. A very enjoyable movie with some of the best music of that era.",1314144000,,149,4.172413793103448
7818053,5,6301965698,"Fast service on quality dvd, a color musical featuring Fred Astaire dancing with Vera Ellen. Enjoyable musical film !",1274832000,,117,5.2105263157894735
7818054,5,6301965698,"This musical comedy, is not the best musical out there. When compared to the great musicals of the past, this one turns out to be a little too whimsicle. The plot doesn't really go anywhere.

The saving grace is that the dancing in this film is wonderful and exact.

The DVD itself is fine, with a nice cover, and fast shipping!

Thanks!",1273017600,2,337,4.403225806451613
7818055,5,6301965698,"They don't make them like this anymore.  Fred Astaire and
Vera-Ellen have some great dance numbers in this musical.  Also there are some really nice songs. It's a really wonderful movie musical. I highly recommend it!",999820800,5,217,5.0
7818056,3,6301965698,"Astaire is a playboy who has a penchant for leaving the bride hanging at the altar (it's like Runaway Bride in reverse), but one look at mission doll Vera-Ellen and he vows to mend his decadent ways.  The film's gimmick is that if one truly falls in love, he'll be floating on air...literally.  Cupid's arrow hits Astaire first, but unfortunately, he's alone in his feelings.  The rest of the film follows predictably so as Astaire sing, dances, and charms Vera-Ellen into falling in love with him.  It seems that whenever Vera-Ellen's around, Fred's floating on air.  The special effects might have been innovative then, but today, it comes across as a nuisance and completely irritating.  It would be like watching the ending of the Sound of Music and seeing mom, dad, and the kids marching up the mountains and up into the sky in a gaudy fluorescent hue.  Anyway, true to form, Astaire performs his routines wonderfully.  Vera-Ellen isn't all that bad, either.  It's just that this movie never picks up that much needed momentum to make this a great and memorable musical.",969321600,2,1075,4.830601092896175
