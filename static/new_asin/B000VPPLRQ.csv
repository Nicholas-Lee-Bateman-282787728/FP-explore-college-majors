8302723,4,B000VPPLRQ,First part is a drag to watch (train) but the second part of the sawmill is great. Not bad to watch.,1279238400,,100,3.8095238095238093
8302724,4,B000VPPLRQ,"This video is pretty interesting.  It starts off a bit slow, and goes into the railroad that runs by the mill perhaps a bit too much.  In the second ""chapter"", though, things get interesting.

One negative is that it does not show much of the technical workings of the mill - I would have liked to see more information about how steam is used to power the steam cylinders and other items on the saw.

Overall, definitely worth watching.",1264032000,2,436,4.481012658227848
8302725,5,B000VPPLRQ,"This dvd gives a wonderful insight to the way milling was done in days gone by, The narration is first class and discriptive, the filming is such that you see all aspects of the mill and it's workers and the way they go about their work, a pleasure to watch. Great credit must go to the
owners for preserving such a relic of the past.",1212019200,,334,4.153846153846154
