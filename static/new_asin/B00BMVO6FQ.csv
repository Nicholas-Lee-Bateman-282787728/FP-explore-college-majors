8571158,1,B00BMVO6FQ,"Websters new meaning for Comedienne: ""One who has a vocabulary consisting only of filthy thoughts and words"".  Men get on stage to demonstrate how men look and sound like when they choose to reject God completely out of their lives.  They whine, dress like losers, sound like street dwellers, belittle everyone in their lives, have low regard for women and children and no regard whatsoever for God.  Godless men can be recognized by their evil thoughts that spew from their mouths as vile brimstone.  Their reprobate minds actually believe that they are funny and interesting to other men and women of wisdom and intelligence.  Evil has knowledge but only wisdom can be found through God.",1505606400,,689,4.956521739130435
