1705730,5,B0000648Y7,"I first saw the show on a flight from Manila to San Francisco.  It was a 16-hour flight but, when I saw Matchbox Twenty, on the screen, I knew I had to be awake for it.  And I also knew I had to get a copy of the show.
Well, it took more than a year for the DVD to be released but it really is worth the wait!  The version of ""3 AM"" is exceptional!  Even if it were only the track in that DVD, I would still have bought this.  (Nevertheless, everything is great!)
Read the insert on the DVD as well.  It's kind of a story behind the story.  And I agree -- it was a remarkable evening!",1036195200,,584,3.7768595041322315

1705733,5,B0000648Y7,"I wasn't able to see the beginning of the show, but I am going to buy it!  I love Matchbox Twenty and if you don't, then you must not know what good music is. (okay okay, everyone has a right to their own opinion) Anyway, buy this DVD! It's the best!",1025740800,,250,3.9019607843137254
1705734,5,B0000648Y7,The ultimate rock band in a great show!  This is a great DVD! You really should buy it! It is great a matchbox twenty proves what great a great band they are!,1018915200,3,158,3.9375
1705735,5,B0000648Y7,I haven't actually seen the video yet since it's not out. But I did catch it on T.V. I would just like to say that Rob as well as the rest of matchbox twenty have a truly amazing talent. You would be blown away. They have given me inspiration and have touched me deeply. I suggest you get this video--quick!!!,1018310400,6,309,4.166666666666667

1705779,5,B0000648Y7,"Ordered this for the reason that I can not find it new anywhere for under an unreasonable amount of $$. Received product using Amazon Prime, the DVD and its packaging were like brand new. Played perfectly, great value for the price. Thanks.",1328054400,,240,4.738095238095238
1705780,5,B0000648Y7,I absolutely love this dvd of Matchbox 20.  It is very intimate almost like having your own personal concert by them. Rob is witty and open when he talks about the music. You can listen to the music with Rob's commentary or just the music alone. The audience is seated in risers so the camera angles are without fan interference. It is more mellow than their arena style concerts. Love it!,1249603200,,389,4.47887323943662
1705781,5,B0000648Y7,"This DVD really impressed me because the DTS sound capabilities blew me away.  You could close your eyes and imagine you were there in the audience with Rob Thomas doing what he does best with his vocal instrument, with Kyle doing what he does best finessing his guitar, and complemented by orchestral support.
Matchbox Twenty are an impressive band, whose music from their 1996 and 2000 albums don't ever date, even playing it now in 2007.  Rob Thomas is the most talented singer/songwriter of these times.  His music and lyrics never tire and so easily relate to everyday living and struggles of modern life.  He has an amazing voice too.  The rest of the band rock as well.
Great music, great sound, great DVD.",1188000000,,713,4.717741935483871
1705782,5,B0000648Y7,I have loved these guys since their Tabitha's Secret days. Honestly Rob Thomas just grows with his music. I loved the intimacy of the VH1 Storytellers so much. Its like your in the room with them. The songs are crisp and clear. As a Matchbox Twenty Fan you really need to own this.,1163894400,,281,4.320754716981132
1705783,5,B0000648Y7,"This is the earliest performance I remember watching of Matchbox 20 and I was mildly interested at the time, but AC music wasn't the coolest to listen to, so I just enjoyed it in passing. VH1 was playing it a lot back then!

Fast forward a few years, MB20 are the hidden tracks on your fave AC radio station and worth listening to.  So last year I snatched up this DVD and it became such a warmer and better performance.  Watching it now, Rob's humor and self-depracation shine thru ;)  and make for interesting tales and narration.  It's interesting to see such a happy guy describing his angst-filled life influences for his generally maudlin tracks.  If you don't wanna know why he wrote these songs, this isn't the DVD for you.  Rob and the gang are fun, but this shows the heart of their sound.  If you're a matchbox 20 fan or a Rob Thomas fan, pick this up.  If not, this probably won't change your mind, but you might watch it more than once...

If for no other reason, buy this just for the jazzy version of Crutch.  Tooooooooo awesome :)",1163462400,2,1046,4.395833333333333
1705784,5,B0000648Y7,It's called Storytellers for a reason!  This DVD is Matchbox Twenty and specifically Rob Thomas telling the stories behind some of their greatest hits up through their Mad Season album.  This is a wonderful music DVD plus you get the added benefit of hearing the inside stories on some of your favorite songs.  And Rob Thomas is just so endearing and cool. You just can't help loving this band.  The highlights for me were Push and Rest Stop.  And a cover of Lonely Weekend and a country version of Push are great fun.  I highly recommend it.,1106611200,14,542,4.536082474226804
1705785,5,B0000648Y7,"This is an AMAZING dvd! Rob Thomas does most if not all of the story telling, BECAUSE HE WROTE THE SONGS...

There is so much emotion in the stories and the lyrics...

Everyone under the age of 65 will LOVE this dvd",1092355200,6,215,4.095238095238095
1705806,5,B0000648Y7,"Excellent DVD!  The sound and the video are excellent!  I have to say that this is the best rock band there is today.  They get better and better with each production.  This performance is really good.  You get to listen to the stories behind their songs, which are very fascinating.  You also get to listen to re-arranged versions of some of their songs.  It is a brilliant video and you should get it.",1056931200,9,403,4.438356164383562
1705807,5,B0000648Y7,"This is a ""must have"" for any collection. It's not just for die hard Matchbox Twenty fans. Rob Thomas sums it all up in his very first statement. The jazzed up rendition of Crutch is awesome, as is the cover version of Lonely Weekend. Rob's charismatic charm is apparent throughout; especially in between pieces where he explains the background to each song and demonstrates his witty humour. This is a DVD you will watch over and over. The sound in either Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS is superb.",1050105600,5,492,4.6022727272727275
1705808,5,B0000648Y7,"I love this DVD!  The band looks and sounds great and I love watching it over and over.  My favorite is their rendition of ""Lonely Weekend"" and the country version of ""Push"" is a fun song to listen to as well.  I would recommend this DVD to any Matchbox Twenty fan or even just to anyone who loves great music.",1041120000,7,310,4.133333333333334
1705809,1,B0000648Y7,"After watching Rob's performance in Santana's latest DVD called ""Supernatural"", which is one of the best DVDs ever, I was expecting a lot more from the Matchbox 20 DVD.
After reading some of the reviews poseted here I decided to give it a shot but now I regret it. I found this DVD very boring for several reasons. First of all, the audience is very small making the show look a little bit artificial. I prefer shows where the audience play a more active, vibrating role. Second, Rob  always says something between the songs (the guy will not shut up and simply sing the songs) which I don't know why some people think is interesting. Third, Rob sings acoustic version of some of the band's greatest hits, which in my opinion did not have the same vibe as the original version.
Regarding the sound quality, no doubt it is great. However, this is a very boring DVD.
My two cents...",1038960000,3,880,4.5
1705810,5,B0000648Y7,"If you are a fan of Matchbox Twenty and even if you're not, this is a must have DVD!! The highlights for me is the renditions of ""Crutch"" and ""3am"". He puts a jazzy/bluesy flavor to ""Crutch"" which is very appealing and his slower version of ""3am"" on the piano will make you speechless and will make you think ""That was awesome, I had no idea Rob Thomas could do that"". You will see what you saw on TV, but without the commercials and an extra of 4 extra songs.
It's also nice to see Rob Thomas and the guys being themselves. At first glance, they may look tough and rough, but they come across as being easy-going, laid-back guys, and it's nice to see Rob's great sense of humor.
This DVD shows what an amazing writer Rob and the rest of the band are. They can take a song of theirs and turn it into something completely different and it sounds better than ever.
I highly recommend this DVD and if you're not a fan of Matchbox Twenty, this DVD just might make you into one!!",1038009600,14,974,4.213903743315508
1705811,5,B0000648Y7,"The storytellers Dvd is WELL worth the money! You get so much more on this DVD than you see on the TV version! Their rendition of ""Lonely Weekend"" is EXCELLENT! Worth getting the DVD just for that. Also the country version of ""Push"" is Superb! This DVD makes you feel as if you are right there with the boys!!! Matchbox Twenty is THE BEST group around and this DVD is a MUST HAVE for fans and non-fans alike, because if you weren't a fan before watching this.........you will be!",1037923200,6,479,4.393258426966292
1705812,4,B0000648Y7,"Thanks to the other reviewers, I checked this out... and it was EVERYTHING as advertised and more. If you have a Surround system with DTS, quite reading this and BUY THE DVD!!!! With the first song ""Bent"" you'll be glad you did. Like the Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over"" DVD, it feels like Rob and Co. are in your living room. Sound quality is top notch, Rob's commentary is short, sweet, and interesting. There's an especially intriguing story behind 3AM that gives you a whole new perspective on the song, which is acoustically sung very hauntingly. With ""More Than You Think You Are"" living up to its high expectations, Matchbox Twenty have clearly establish them as this generations outstandingly innovative rock bands. Hopefully the boys will continue to put live music out on DVD with DTS. Would have given it 5 stars, but it could have been longer and could have included ""Real World"", ""Back to Good"", and other cool tunes, but what is on there is well worth the money. And hey, got to leave some room for the next DVD!",1037664000,,1020,4.640883977900552
1705813,5,B0000648Y7,"Matchbox 20 have proven that they are one of the best bands of modern times with an unbeatable combination of clever lyrics and catchy tunes. Frontman Rob Thomas was the only reason Santana finally received any awards - lets face it, 'Smooth' would have been a Matchbox20 hit if the guitar was performed by the backing band. Their debut album ""Yourself or someone like you"" spawned a number of hit singles plus numerous music videos.
Matchbox 20 live are a refreshing change from numerous modern bands who can perform in the studio but not infront of an audience. Both 'Live in Australia' and this new VH-1 edition show a group a the top of their game with the slick teamwork that comes from a group who spend a great deal of time touring.",1037404800,4,739,4.56390977443609
1705814,5,B0000648Y7,"A great look into the mind of Rob Thomas and he describes some of the inspirations behind many of his hit songs. Thomas gets very personal even revealing the fact that he doens't like the sound of his own voice! This DVD features a great mix of songs from their initial album ""Yourself or Someone Like you"" and the follow up ""Mad Season"".
The only downside to Matchbox Twenty's storytelling session is the lack of acoustic versions of hit songs; a favorite aspect of mine that blends in nicely with the intimate feel of the show. This is more than made up for with the a country version of push, and nice variations for fans wanting a twist in their favorite CD versions.
The highlight of the show is a piano version of 3AM that will leave you speechless. Seeing Rob alone on the piano after hearing his meaning behind the song brings the audience to tears, and a new appreciation of the song to all who listen.
Overall a great performance by a great band that is sure to please all who watch. VH1's storytellers is always a great show and Matchbox Twenty's episode is no exception so enjoy!",1036368000,21,1091,4.46

This concert has given me a new found respect, I admit mostly for Rob, for the pure talent he possesses! He's song writing is that of a poet, combined with a natural talent to ooze the emotion from the lyrics puts him up there with the best in my book - total CLASS",1425945600,,440,4.25
