29911,5,0780021045,"The first part of director Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai trilogy, that is SAMURAI I : MIYAMOTO MUSASHI, won in 1954 the academy award for best foreign movie released in the U.S.. It's a movie filmed in glorious  Eastmancolor and shot, for the most part of it, in the japanese landscapes.  Set in 1600 A.D., in a civil war period, SAMURAI I relates the first years  of samurai apprenticeship of Takezo who, with his friend, Matahachi,  decides to go to war in order to obtain fame.
Wild, without attach,  Takezo will soon turn into a ronin, a samurai without a Master nor a  philosophical goal. He becomes an animal and is finally caught by his  fellowmen. Saved by a buddhist monk, he will learn Wisdom by reading  books.
You will find in SAMURAI I several characters and situations one  will encounter in numerous other japanese or even american movies. For  instance, the Mother and her Daughter, alone in their lost wooden house,  who will become extremely dangerous after a few weeks can be recognized a  few years later in Kobayashi's KWAIDAN and, why not, in John Milius's CONAN  THE BARBARIAN.
I've loved SAMURAI I's cinematography that makes us  discover the japanese nature and gives undoubtedly an epic atmosphere to  the movie. I've loved Toshiro Mifune's madness which leads him to battle  against dozens of armed soldiers with only a wooden stick. In fact, I'm  very enthusiastic about this movie and cannot wait to see the two other  parts of this trilogy.
If you are curious about foreign sagas, SAMURAI I  is definitely

The movie never showed any of Musashi Miyamoto's childhood or his demanding father (Samurai), which would have explained why Musashi was the way that he was. The movie never showed any of his Samurai training, never bothered to talk about his education and really did a bad job in trying to develop the legend of the greatest Swordman in all of Japan. In this Movie Musashi was more mouse that man, he was unruly, pig headed, stubborn, uneducated and mad at the world, which explains nothing close to his up ringing as the child of a Samurai. It never talked about his mothers and as far as all his love interest, the movie pretty much created most of it. I did not appreciate the Director or Writer,s take on Musashi Miyamoto. It never explained why his home village was hunting him down, not really, It was just a mess.

My only quibble with this Criterion version is that certain scenes are cut in a way that is irritating to me. Therefore the continuity is interrupted. The VHS version has all the action but not the clarity of this digital form. However, it's subtitles are poorly translated and sometimes unreadable. This should not deter new viewers from watching one of the best adventure series ever produced anywhere in the world.

29986,4,0780021045,"Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune stars as an unfocused ball of furious youthful energy in this first installment of the famed Samurai Trilogy. As Takezo, the adopted black sheep of a small feudal village, Mifune is wild, passionate and unfocused in his quest for adventure and respect. Seeking a romanticized status as samurai, he rushes off to join the losing side of a civil war, enticing his best friend to tag along in search of similar fame and fortune. What follows is a broad adventure across the landscapes of Japan, chance encounters with a colorful batch of faces, and an awful lot of unresolved plot threads. As can be expected with the first act of any saga, there isn't much finality to be found here; it really seems as though we're only beginning to scratch the surface when the curtain drops, and that compete lack of closure left me feeling a touch jilted, justifiably or not. Later chapters have a wealth of storytelling riches to expand upon, though, with two rebellious youths beginning to come of age in vastly different ways, a fistful of foils closing in on each, an unresolved love triangle muddying the waters and a clear-cut destination on the horizon. On its own, this is little more than an incomplete tease. In the context of a three-film arc, though, it's much more digestible as a rich, diverse pin-setter. I want more.",1329264000,,1349,4.793991416309013
29987,2,0780021045,"I am a big fan of Akira Kurosawa movies. Mifune, as admitted  by Kurosawa himself in public, is a big part of Kurosawa's magic. So I picked this movie to see Mifune working with another director. Well Kurosawa work is a pretty high bar and this movie is not even close. I had to give up after 1.5h of watching.  The reviews talked about beautiful cinematography and gripping story keeping you on the edge of the couch.

For me ""Gripping"" story was seriously undermined by many historically inaccurate aspects, some bordering on plain silly. Consider this: the movie is set in year 1600 AD. At this time Japan just went through what is known as ""100 years of war"". A historic civil strife which decimated Japan's population and ruined its economy. According to this movie it somehow strengthened feudal Japan's postal service. Because peasants and bandits send and promptly receive letters. Apparently all peasants are literate and are masters of calligraphy.
Important peasant characters run around wearing exquisite silk robes which Paris Hilton would not mind wearing. The robes stay spotless no matter how many times (a lot, do not even try counting) the character gets knocked to the ground.
Sword-fighting scenes are mediocre at best. Director creates a notion that an amateur swordsman with a *wooden"" sword routinely facing dozens of men armed with real swords and spears, comes out without a scratch. This is absurd. Check out Kurosawa sword scenes.
Apparently Musashi, the greatest swordsman of all times, is a wussy. Yes, he cries a lot in this movie.

Cinematography: There are lots of hilly country shots in the movie (often very dark). But they do not quite jell with the story so effect is lost. A lot of the movie is shot against very dark background. Director was definitely trying to to tell us something by constantly putting his characters into almost complete darkness. I do not know what director's message is but I have 2 ideas:
1. Movie producers saved BIG on sets and decorations
2. It is an artistic expression of rural Japan longing for electricity.

I can go on. For example in the scene of battle Musashi goes berserk despite his side routed by the enemy. Next shot - battle has ended (his side lost) Musashi gets up from the ground. He is unharmed. Then why was he laying on the ground? Did he get exhausted from running or what?

Nothing quite makes sense. Mifune's acting is very decent but director does not make full use of it. We barely see his face.",1326499200,3,2484,4.778554778554779
29988,3,0780021045,"some of the scenes in the film were o.k. but as far as being anything about musashi,who ever made this film,made up crap as they went along,about miyamoto.what a shameful thing.aside from that,,,,,good seller,,,fast delivery,,,,,decent quality.",1316304000,,244,5.805555555555555
29989,3,0780021045,"Few philosophers are renowned for their guidance in military tactics or their competence as men of the battlefield. Considering that such men excel in the art of brutal killing, they seem an odd category of people to recommend to the masses the right methods of life. A large part of the population have for long wisdom of such men, Niccol Machiavelli and Sun Tzu springing readily to mind, as they are seen as playing the devil's advocate for the cruel rulers they guide. However demented or wise these men may be, they without doubt shaped the political and social structure of their government and their influence has carried on even to our era. Among such men, the case of the protagonist of Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto is an unusual one; a ronin-a samurai without a Lord or House to serve-as the political and military philosopher. His text on military strategy, The Book of Five Rings, is still being read and scrutinized in many areas, from philosophy to business.

A famed swordsman, Musashi Miyamoto, was an unbeatable warrior whose legacy carries on as one of the most rebellious and intriguing men of his time. Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto is the first segment of a trilogy of films depicting Musashi's life; as it is the first segment it focuses on his early exploits to become a samurai. Following the loss of his side at the Battle of Sekigahara, he takes refugee with his fellow friend, Honiden Matahachi, at the house of a widow and her daughter. The daughter and widow fall in love with Musashi due to his swordsmanship that kills, injures, and scares of a large portion of the ronin that demands favors such as money, food, jewelry-especially Gold-to leave them unharmed. He rejects both women while Matahachi attaches himself to the women, even though he has promised to return to his faithful fianc. Angered by this event, Musashi returns to his village to inform Matahachi's mother and fianc of his whereabouts.
As in many other classic Samurai films,  Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto contains great acting, by the likes of no other than Toshiro Mifune, an able director, and carefully chosen settings. Even with all the good performances and genuinely fine screenplay, based on a contemporary Japanese novel of Musashi's life, the film is ultimately forgettable. Undeniably, the film simply aims at describing Musashi's earliest years, but in turn creates a work that could only interest fans of Musashi Myamoto rather than the average filmgoer. What really drains the film is the lack of comprehension of Musashi's true talent and vigor; on the surface he seems indistinguishable from countless samurai of other samurai flicks. Granted that he may be a shallow samurai, no insight or philosophy is assigned to character. It is quite unexplained why he hates the village and its inhabitants as much as he does. Without some insight about the true significance of Musashi, the audience of the film will be more confused at the significance of this character that seems to lack any significant characteristic worth caring for.

Strangely, the film succeeds in making Musashi look like a complete loon and fool, and not a believable one. In the hunt that ensues, he succeeds in overpowering nearly everyone, but surrenders himself to the Priest with no opposition; it is not the surrender that is strange, but the method of surrender which is so spiritless and uncharacteristic of the samurai character that Musashi so eagerly demands to achieve. If that wasn't enough, Musashi is deceived a second time by the Priest who caused him so much suffering and humiliation. Unfortunately, the story line may be believable and acceptable in the novel that the film is based on, but many of the film's developments seem to embarrassingly display the filmmaker's inability of giving the work an acceptable ending.

Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto is insignificant not because Musashi's himself is not interesting for the contemporary viewer, far from it, but because he is utterly identical to every other samurai you have seen. As it is shown, he is a great swordsman, but, then again, are not all samurai? As much as Toshiro Mifune attempts to show us the rebellious, and eventual moral character, of Musashi we are at a loss, because the script is so thinly developed that even the noblest efforts of the entire cast combined can not make the film the great picture that it truly deserves to be. Surprisingly, Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto was presented with Academy  Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 28th (1955) Oscars; however, odd a selection this may be, it is not nearly as strange why the following two segment of the trilogy were devoid of such honors.",1276041600,2,4672,4.938931297709924
29990,4,0780021045,"Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto is the beginning of his great Samurai Trilogy started in 1954 and completed three years later for Toho International. The series of films has been compared to one With The Wind and to Kurasawa's Seven Samurai.

It is 1600 and Japan is in the midst of a civil war. Two friends  Takezo (Toshiro Mifune) and Matahachi (Rentaro Mikuni) join the troops and wind up on the losing side of the Battle of Sekigahara. Matahachi is wounded and the friends find shelter in the home of Oko (Mitsuko Mito) and her daughter Akemi( Mariko Okada). Matahachi eventually betrays his friend and leaves with Oko after an attack by bandits. Takezo returns home to the village of Miyamoto where he is treated as a fugitive.

Takezo finds friendship with the former fiance of Matahachi,Otsu (Kaoru Yachigusa)and with a Buddist priest Takuan (Kuroemon Onoe) who believes that the rash youth needs to change his life in order to become the samurai he is destined to become. the first part of the trilogy deals with Takezo's early life and ends with the beginning of his travels in the samurai lifestyle.

The film,even though marketed as an adventure story,is in reality more of a story of spiritual growth. It is almost a zen meditation on living one's life to meet one's ultimate potential.

Also of note here is the brillient cinematography of Jun Yasumoto. His Eastmancolor compositions look as great today as they did in 1955. The Criterion disc is a rather bare bones affair however. It features only the trailer for the film as a bonus. The sound and the subtitling are quite good. The only slight problem with the transfer is that it is quite dark at times but this may be a flaw in the original material.

This film is well worth the purchase price and is a good introduction to Inagaki's work. Highly recommended.",1232841600,,1843,4.761755485893417
29991,5,0780021045,"This is a magnificent story and a terrific film.  It won the Oscar(tm) for Best Foreign Film in 1954 and deserves the honored position it holds in film history.  I not only recommend it, I encourage you to see it.  Unless you speak Japanese, you do have to read the subtitles, but very soon you won't even be aware that you are doing it.

Toshiro Mifune plays the title character, Musashi Myamoto (a name he acquires later in the film - he starts out as a poor Samurai wannabe named Takezo).  The story is set in a war torn Japan in the year 1600.  Takezo decides that going off to war to join the army marching through his village is a sure way to glory and fame.  He encourages his friend, Matahachi, to join him.  But his friend is engaged to be married to a very poor girl named Otsu (who is taken advantage of by his horrible mother).  But friendship and dreams of glory conquer love and off they go to war.  Of course, it is far from glorious and their army is routed while they dig ditches.  Matahachi is terribly wounded and Takezo exhibits strength and heroism to get him to a place where he can be cared for.  But the two women (mother and daughter) who care for them are something you will have to see the movie to find out.

You also need to pay attention to the priest from the home village of Takezo and Matachi.  He understands people very well, is quite smart, and cares for Takezo and Otsu more than either understands.

A marvelous film, as I said.

Enjoy.

30012,4,0780021045,"""Samurai I,"" starring Toshiro Mifune as first Takezo, then Miyamoto Musashi, is an excellent film into the trilogy which will conclude with the final, and best episode, ""Samurai III: Duel at Ganryu Island."" In this first film, Takezo (Toshiro Mifune) as he is known in the begining, [but will later be named Miyamoto Musashi], is a brash young man. As a peasant, he decides to leave his village and enter the army, which is on its way to do battle. However, he becomes despondent when his side is defeated. As he returns to his village, he has become an outcast, and when arrested for treason, he is saved by a monk from death, who tells Takezo to study the samurai code. When looking back on the episode, I realize that director Inagaki did a very good job with his plot development, as we see a brash and abrasive Takezo's fall from his lofty ambitions in the begining, to eventually emerge as a true samurai, due to the intervention of the priest Takuan.

It is the teachings of this priest that will set Takezo on the right path in life. Yet, Takezo must face many obstacles: most of which are of his own making, and of his inner self. His development into the samurai he wishes to be, and the samurai he eventually becomes is due to the efforts of the priest Takuan. From an irrational and wild young man, Takezo will some day emerge into a samurai who can hold his head up high. In the meantime, however, he aspires to be a great samurai. The character development that Hiroshi Inagaki gives to the characters in the film are very good. Otsu (Kaoru Yachigusa), who becomes loyal to Takezo, and eventually frees him and flees with him, will become central to the films plot, and her role will continue until the final episode.

However, this is a Toshiro Mifune film. Albeit, with great characters in the film itself, his character and changing nature is the heart of the films trilogy. However, I really liked the character of the priest Takuan. This first film of the trilogy allows the viewer to understand how and why Takezo is the way he is. Where he comes from in his life, and why he aspires to be a great samurai. The film succeeds in large part due to the rough hewn nature of the samurai during the Tokugawa period. The film is not complete, in that the viewer must see the changes that Takezo [later Miyamoto Musashi] must undergo in order for the film to make full sense. I recommend that you watch all three episodes before coming to any conclusions in this first installment. The questions are all answered in the films trilogy in the climatic and suspenseful final episode. This is well worth viewing, and owning. I recommend the film highly, and add that if you stick with the first two installments, and see the final episode you will not be disappointed. Highly recommended.",1166486400,3,2797,4.569721115537849
30013,3,0780021045,"The always-reliable Toshiro Mifune plays a wild young man with a strong urge to go off and fight in a local civil war.  He goes, the war doesn't turn out well, and the young man Takezo (the Mifune character) ventured off with takes up with a prairie floozy and her beautiful daughter and promptly forgets all about the girl he left behind. Takezo doesn't, though, and when he returns to the village to tell Otsu of the betrayal by some prestidigitation or other he finds himself hunted by the villagers on trumped up charges of treason and proceed to hunt our young hero like a swamp dog.

 Then or thereabouts a Buddhist priest enters the story and becomes the pivot point in the first installment in an epic trilogy.  Will the priest prove able to break Takezo's stubborn willfulness without breaking his spirit?  MIYAMOTO MUSASHI is released by Criterion and won an honorary, foreign language Academy Award in 1955.  That's a pretty potent combination that's hard to resist, and I stuck this one in the player figuring maybe it is, as some have claimed, the Japanese `Gone With the Wind.'

 Then I remembered I'm not all that partial to GWTW, either.  Well, the `either' came after I watched MM and decided its `classic' elements eluded me.  For one thing, its afflicted with first-installment-itis - it takes a whole long time for the plot to pick up momentum, and the ending has the always frustrating `to be continued' written all over it. Not only is it somewhat slow and choppy and inconclusive, its centerpiece - a climatic battle between Takezo and a forest full of angry men with long, pointy sticks - is a fizzle. It either wasn't choreographed well before filming, or the editors botched it in the cutting room, or the director didn't film enough footage for the editor to use in the first place.  In any event, what ought to be a stirring, pitched battle is nothing much more than Toshiro Mifune hopping and snarling and spitting at a herd of extras who don't come within fifteen feet of him.

 MIYAMOTO MUSASHI was good enough for me to recommend, just, and intriguing enough to line up a viewing of the final two installments.  Kind of a mucky, dirty, hard-to-read print as well.",1138665600,3,2195,4.682291666666667
30014,3,0780021045,"It is easy to overrate certain films, and this is one of them.  Certain films, like this one, have a lot of status for some reason.  This is not a great film.  The story isn't absorbing enough.  There are some other faults as well.

The battle scenes are unbelievable.  A number of times we have one solitary fighter, either Takezo or his friend, beating off a large number of attackers.  The way this is accomplished is by showing the hero spinning around, and every time he swings his sword, someone else falls.  It is absurd.  The men fell, in turn, because the script told them to.  There is no realism in any of the battle scenes.

We also don't understand why the characters behave as they do.  We just have to chalk it up to Japanese culture, or whatever.  They make no sense as real people.  Why did the priest treat Takezo as he did?  Ya got me!  Why did Takezo make the final decision he made?  Ya got me again.  I don't feel it.

In one scene, darling Otsu tells Takezo to wait for him, and she disappears to change her clothes.  Obviously he was going to walk out on her.  I thought Otsu was an absolute idiot for walking away to change her clothes, after begging him to let her accompany him.  Do you think he stayed and waited for her?  How foolish was that scene.

It is a fairly absorbing story, but not nearly as absorbing as the book Musashi.  I can't give this film more than 3 stars.

One thing that annoys me in Amazon reviews is how often people say ""the movie was great but the dvd was bad"".  It is a cliche already.  Rate the movie.  When you are talking about a classic like this one, the only permissible way to criticize it is by saying the movie is great but the dvd is bad.  Well, this movie isn't great.  It's pretty good.

30015,4,0780021045,"Often called a ""Japanese 'Gone With the Wind,'"" Hiroshi Inagaki's beautiful trilogy follows the story of the legendary real-life samurai Musashi Miyamoto (played by the almost-always amazing Toshiro Mifune) on his journey from being a rebellious young man to becoming a masterful warrior. I find it difficult to separate these three films (parts 1-3) in terms of individual merit. By watching all three films the end result is greater than the sum total of each part. Criterion offers each film separately or together in a boxed set. The first film, titled Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto introduces the viewer to Musashi who begins his long journey be becoming a fugitive in his home land. Along the way, he is saved by and later falls in love with the beautiful Otsu and is befriended by a priest who becomes his mentor and teaches him the way of the samurai. It is also worth noting that this first volume received the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1955. On the downside, the entire trilogy is skimpy in special features (there are no audio commentaries and the inner booklet is rather insubstantial compared to subsequent Criterion Collection releases). However, no amount of extra features can redeem a truly aweful movie, and a lack of extra features cannot take aware from a truly great movie.",1113004800,,1305,4.909502262443439

If you are expecting to find a perfect book-to-film in this (or any other for that matter) then, you are looking for something that dosen't exist. It's not possible to take a book and make a movie that has the same level of detail. You just can't do it. That aside, this is a truly geat movie. For the 50's, the visual quality of the the film is amazing. Mifune and the entire supporting cast do a superb job in portraing the characters brought to life by Yoshikawa. I must say though, if you buy one film then you have to get the next 2 and watch them in succession in order to be able to truly appreciate the story.",1053475200,4,792,4.14935064935065

These films trace the development (both physical and moral) of a headstrong young Samurai-to-be.  However, the transfers on these discs are rather bad.  All three of the discs feature pitting and scratching, as well as bothersome color shifts and faded prints.  A strange glitch early in this first film is a digital ""wave"" of some sort which runs through a scene of two men sitting in a tree.
These films are excellent and I highly recommend them to samurai film fans and film fans in general.  They probably won't be reissued at any time soon, either.  Be warned, however, that the prints are quite bad (although they are certainly watchable).",1050796800,14,743,4.857142857142857

30020,5,0780021045,"Winner of the 1955 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, Samurai I:  Musashi Miyamoto is a work of wonder. The Samurai Trilogy is by far one of the world's greatest epics, recounting the journey of Takezo, a brash, hotheaded young peasant to enlightened and invincible swordsman Miyamoto Musashi.
This work of art is beautifully directed by Hiroshi Inagaki (also known for the brilliant Chushingura) in fabulous color and beautiful cinematography. Ikuma Dan's musical score is stirring and dramatic. Yet the toast goes to the spectacular performance of Japan's greatest actor, the venerable TOSHIRO MIFUNE. Truly, it took one of the world's greatest actors to play the part of History's greatest swordsman.
This film opens in one of the milestones of Earth's Military History, the Battle of Sekigahara, which unifies Japan for the first time in centuries under the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu, whose dynasty lasts for over 350 years. Takezo and his friend decide to join the battle in search of quick fame and a samurai title. Unfortunately, they join the losing side.
After a narrow escape and a stay with Oko and Akemi (played by the charming Mariko Okada), Takezo decides to go home -being abandoned by his friend in the meanwhile. Troubles abound when finding himself a fugitive in his own village, whose inhabitants mercilessly hunt him like an animal. His fate would have been tragic were it not for the famous Zen Priest Takuan -who sees great potential in this defiant young man, and the lovely Otsu (played memorably by Kaoru Yachigusa) who saves him from a bleak fate and whose love provides a reason for living.
Under Takuan's tutelage and sponsorship, Takezo becomes Musashi Miyamoto, a samurai on search of repute. Unfortunately for Otsu, their love must remain unfulfilled while he journeys for adventure. Despite all of this she loyally awaits their reunion over the years.
This Film succeeds with great character development, a moving storyline and sheer kinetic energy. Beyond this it is a poignant allegory of the hidden potential in all of us for something greater, and the values that help us achieve it: loyalty, love, and duty.

30032,4,0780021045,"I have read Musashi by Eijo Yoshikawa, and I can safely say it is my second favorite novel behind ""Old Path White Clouds"".  I decided to buy all three Samurai DVDs to see how they compared with the book.  While the films generally capture the essence of the story, they are far too condensed to do the book justice.  Where is Jotaro? Jotaro was one of the most entertaining characters in the book, and he is barely visible in the movie.  Also, this is a small gripe...but could they have picked a worse actor to play Sasaki Kojiro?",1024272000,,531,4.387755102040816
30033,5,0780021045,"I'll admit I was sceptical when I first saw this movie; I was a great fan of Yoshikawa's novel, and although I loved Inagaki's Chushingura, I feared he might not be as successful with the story of Musashi.
I can say honestly I was wrong.  While not as informed by Western film technique as Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (nearly contemporaneous), it is a fine movie, breaking out of the mold of Japanese cinema (which can be very staid).  Of course, the great strength (as with many of Kurosawa's films) is the awesome performance by Mifune, who really came across well as Musashi.
There are no poor performances in this wonderful film, which manages at a mere 93 minutes to avoid feeling too short, while packing in a great deal of action and character development.  A beautiful compression of the beginning of Yoshikawa's novel, and a prize addition to any library.",1010966400,14,861,4.76510067114094

However, if you want to understand what this film is about, get a copy of the book ""Musashi"" by Yoshikawa Eiji, one of Japans top novelists (Harper & Row, Publishers/Kodansha International, ISBN 0-06-859851-3).  It is the story of Musashi Miyamoto and the film is based on this book.  Read it and you will understand more fully the people, places and intricacies of the film.  Even though the three-part film is long, it isn't long enough to do justice to the book.
Read the book, then watch (or re-watch) the film, you'll be amazed.",1008460800,6,798,4.802919708029197
30035,5,0780021045,"I enjoy Japanese films, and Toshiro Mifune is one of my favorite actors.  Samurai I Musashi Miyamoto, the first of a trilogy by Inagaki, is an excellent example of the genre, justly winning an Academy Award for best foreign film in 1955.  In color, which many of the other Japanese films in my collection are not, the cinematography is lovely.  Although lacking some of the artistic panache of Kurosawa's or Kobayashi's work, Inogaki's film is not the less visually satisfying for it.  Whereas both Kurosawa and Kobayashi's films seem at times too constrained with respect to set, color and special effects which at times distracts from the main theme of their story, Inagaki's Samurai I relies on the natural charms of the Japanese countryside and its national architectural style.  Some of the settings are exquisite, and the buildings have an almost Frank Lloyd Wright fitness, complimenting their environment without being intrusive.
The story has a dramatist's sense of character development.  The growth of the central character Takezo, for instance, from a selfish unruly youth, shunned even by members of his own family, to samurai ""intern"" is thoroughly credible.  Like the anti-hero in The Red Badge of Courage, he learns that war is anything but high drama, the mere stage upon which a young man may play out his role, earning glory and wealth in the process, and is, instead, everything about hard choices, survival, and, at times, lost causes.
The real hero of the work, in my opinion, is the priest Takuan, whose own story might make a good film.  It certainly made me curious.  He cunningly captures the  renegade wild man Takezo, depending upon a rational rather than a brute force approach.  Thereafter he puts the young man first through a rough period meant to break him--much like the wild horse that Takuan himself tried to break earlier in the film--and then imprisons him with a library of books and plenty of undisturbed time in which to read them.  (My one criticism would be that I find it difficult to believe that so many common people were literate at this time in Japanese history, although I admit to little knowledge of it.)
The hero's friend, Matahachi, makes a perfect foil for Takezo.  He has responsibilities, a place in society, and much to live for, yet throws it away to join in the dangerous pursuit of fame and glory.  When confronted with temptations, he gives in, and although he chastises himself for his weakness, he doesn't learn from his mistakes.  Near the end of the film he bitterly blames his wife for his disappointments, unable even as an adult to take responsibility for his own poor decisions.
The film has several strong female characters.  The young orphan Otsu, the heroine, is loyalty itself.  When she realizes she has put the young Takezo in a very bad position by assisting in his capture and that she is herself a prisoner of her circumstances, she frees him and flees with him to the wilderness.  Her own loss should he abandon her would have been immeasurable, helpless as she is without family to rely upon, yet she evinces a belief in his goodness that helps shape the new man will become.  The two woman living on the battle field are powerful survivors.  They do what they must to create a life for themselves, and although they later fall into a life of self indulgence, their gender and their lack of connections within traditional society leaves them few choices.  They are the people that circumstances have made them, while Matahachi, who is again a perfect foil with his youth, his gender, his family ties, and his prospects, becomes the person he is by poor choices and an inability to accept responsibility for them.
This is a thoroughly satisfying film, and I expect to purchase the others in the collection as I can afford to do so.",1003104000,42,3811,4.814417177914111

The motives of the Buddhist monk is not clear nor is the reasons for Mifune's character's decision at the end of the film.  I'm sure it would have the emotional impact it deserves if these threads of sense were woven in.  Well, until I see the other two, I won't be able to make much sense of the first movie which on the whole seems like a downer.  usally there is some build to a catharsis but the expected one here seems anticlimatic because the moment is understated without plot.  This is a commonality among Western interpretations of Japanese cinema to imply understatement but here it is really evident.  Instead of ""flowing like calligraphy"" the plot is predictable and the scene changes often seemingly random.

I think that the packaging of these 3 films separately is misleading, it really is a trilogy, even more so than the Star Wars trilogy - there is little point to just seeing one.
The greater time and space of a triple-length feature allows the filmmaker to give greater depth of characterization, and it is used well in these films.
