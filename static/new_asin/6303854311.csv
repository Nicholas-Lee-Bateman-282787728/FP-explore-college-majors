717180,5,6303854311,"Hick family go to Des Moines for State Fair. Girl wins prize fo best pie. Boy wins ribbon for best pig, mom has best pickles, Dad guesses everyones weight...bizarre. And this homily to middle America of the mid 1940's...could easily be dismissed as pure sap. Except for on thing - there is a disturbingly haunting edge to this film. Amid the festivities comes this stranger who seduces the young naive farm girl. He claims to be a reporter for the Des Moines Register. But he doesn't seem to know much about Des Moines. A one of a kind film that is visually stunning and hypnotic. Listen for Harry Morgan's voice-over as a carney. Almost the entire film takes place at the fair...in real time!",991699200,4,693,4.596774193548387
717181,5,6303854311,"Some ""scholars"" of Rodgers and Hammerstein's portfolio view ""State Fair"" as probably the composer and lyricist's weakest creation.  Looking back some fifty-six years this film adaptation of Phil Stong's novel seems dated, but it's songs and beautiful score make the DVD a ""must"" acquisition, worthy of any collection of broadway and Hollywood musicals.
The cast is incredibly strong, and I agree with those who've stated that Jeanne Crain is awesome, perfect for part.
The disc's extra features, notes on the cast and the film's production add to the enjoyment of this musical classic.",985132800,4,585,5.290322580645161
717182,5,6303854311,"This 1945 musical is pure family fun. It's a good film staring Dana Andrews and Jeanne Crain, but I prefer the excellent 1962 remake also pure family fun. The kids will just love the scene when Tom Ewell sings to a pig in the 1962 version! That first-rate piece of Americana was filmed in 1961 at Fair Park in Dallas, Texas. The CinemaScope photography was just beautiful and was a vast improvement over the 1945 version. Director, Jos Ferrer took full advantage of the fair grounds in Dallas where the Cotton Bowl is located. The Texas Hall of State building, an achievement of architectural Art Deco was prominently featured. Inside is the Great Hall and it has an Art Deco mural adorning both sides of its walls depicting the state's colorful history and these in turn are adorned by Texas' six flags: Spain, France, Mexico, Republic of Texas, The Confederate States and The United States. The 1945 version has a stronger cast but the 1962 version holds its own in more realistic fashion. There are many excellent stars in it including Pat Boone, Bobby Darin, Ann-Margret and Wally Cox. Alice Faye came out of retirement to play Pamela Tiffin's mother in a memorable performance. Walter Lang directed this 1945 version it too a remake from the 1933 version. Lang is a better director than Ferrer, but he doesn't have CinemaScope. All in all both films are strong on Americana and expound the virtues of man in harmony with his fellow man. This is great family fun and is great American nostalgia as we see a state fair when they used to look like a state fair.",972345600,8,1563,4.666666666666667
717183,5,6303854311,"Who would've thought that a favorite movie of mine, more than 20 years ago, would become an often requested movie at home from my 5 and 7 year old children!  They walk around humming the songs and pretending they are  pickle tasters.
This show is 1st rate and its only crime was that it had  to follow so closely behind Oklahoma.  Jeane Craine was at her absolute  best.  You feel her 'boar'dom at home with fianc&eacute; Harry and the joy she  feels with Pat.  Wayne is almost convincing as a farm boy but looked more  at home at the Manhatten style birthday party for Marty.  And don't forget  about the romance of Blue Boy and  Esmerelda.
This is a great movie with  wonderful music that the whole family will enjoy.",953596800,,719,4.438461538461539
717184,5,6303854311,"All I can say is that this movie leaves you with a good feeling. It is a movie that wouldn't...COULDN'T be made today. The songs are as sweet as apple pie, the characters as warm and inviting as chicken soup. Sure, the  language may be dated, the plot predictable and implausible, but hey, it's  worth it. Jeanne Crain was perfectly cast as the innocent Margy, and every  scene is filled with nostalgia. It's almost as if the movie was MEANT to be  looked back upon 50 years later, it's so perfect. Look for the delightful  mince meat and pickle scene. PURE AMERICANA AT ITS BEST!",951350400,6,580,4.485714285714286
717185,3,6303854311,"Rodgers and Hammerstein only contributed six songs to their only original film musical but one of those songs became the Oscar-winning classic, IT MIGHT AS WELL BE SPRING.  It is also the only song that grows out of the  character and plot. The others are, uncharacteristically for R&H, just  songs that could have been written for any film. The story is slight, the  direction and performances are plesant, and it adds up to just another  competent Fox Technicolor musical.  Also nominated for Best Original Score  by the Academy. Note: Compare it with the stark and dramatic original 1933  film - the best of all three versions - and the CinemaScope remake of 1962  with Pat Boone and Ann-Margret (a horror).  This latter was available on  video for about five years, then nose dove into oblivion.  It did contain  five songs written solely by Richard Rodgers.  The Academy was not  impressed.",914371200,,895,4.873333333333333

717371,5,6303854311,One of the best 'family' type films ever!  R&H tunes abound in this film.  It's a welcome relief from today's trite movies.  Dick Haymes was one of my favorite singers and his vocal prowess shines in 'State Fair' and the rest of the cast couldn't be more perfect! It's just a nice film and it makes me yearn for the Golden Age of Hollywood.  Highly recommended!,1491264000,3,361,4.424242424242424

717541,5,6303854311,"The farm and fair remind me of growing up on a farm and the fairs we had years ago.  Of course the love interests move quickly and typically things don't happen like that, but it's a movie!  The music is terrific and the songs are ones we still sing today.  Referring again to the fair,  it's so fun to see the judging of Blue Boy the pig and the women's pickles and mincemeat.  We did those things and it was fun.  We looked forward to the fair because we'd see and know so many people there.  Everyone would come and bring a picnic lunch or buy a hot dog and popcorn.  I love the parents in this movie.  They are the salt of the earth and very much like my own parents.",1466467200,3,671,4.0227272727272725

Still, the elephant in the room nobody sees is World War 2. This film was made in 1945 and you would never know it was the final year of the war. Obviously draft age men attend the fair, no gas rationing, etc. It was probably just glossed over to keep the theme light and free of serious content. And I have to admit Jeanne Crain was quite attractive here. Dana Andrews was quite an accomplished vocalist, but he and Jeanne Crain just lip-synched their way through the film. Anyway, it was still a pleasant few minutes to visit a vanished America.",1420329600,,723,4.443609022556391

Watching it transported me back to a time in life when dating was new to me. The thought of being in love some day was exciting. I always wondered what kind of man I would marry, what he would look like, where would we live, and how many children we would have. I loved, loved, loved this movie. My 18 year old daughter walked in about 5 minutes into the movie and couldn't help but watch it with me. That's saying a lot since this is a young lady who has her laptop on her at all times as if it were an extension of her arm and one earbud dangling from her head at all times. It is just so wonderful to have seen her face when she didn't see me looking. I saw her smile, barely look at her computer and get lost in the movie too.

This is the only one of R & H's musicals that was specifically written to go on the big screen. It may seem hokey by today's standards, but it is worth seeing. It gives us a beautiful glimpse into the days when pigs and pies were more important than many other things, and when state fairs were so important in life that people planned for them twelve months in advance.

719524,5,6303854311,"I'll throw my hat in with the group of people who feel the 1945 version of State Fair is much better than the 1962 remake. For one, I think Jeanne Crain brought much more to the role of Margy than Pamela Tiffin.  I felt drawn to her as the heroine right from the start and saw the many sides to her -- cunning, vivacious, and clearly excited about being at the State Fair feverish for a tall, dark, and handsome stranger (and Pat Gilbert was just what the doctor ordered). Yes, the chemistry between Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews was off the chart. With Tiffin and Darin, it was more like meh!

The 1945 version followed the book a lot closer although there were certainly changes. (If you haven't read Phil Stong's book, I strongly urge you to. It's full of beautiful prose that just dances off each page. I read all 265 pages in a day and a half) I liked the Iowa setting in the movie. You'll have the read the book to get the full, rich flavor of the Midwest.  And did anyone notice Abel's feeling towards Blue Boy?  Everything was ""son this"" and ""son that."" The man truly loved that hog.

So rent the video and if you're like me, you'll end up buying it. But  be sure to have a box of tissues handy. Some parts of it are real tear jerkers.",1396396800,3,1243,4.223628691983122

719527,4,6303854311,"State Fair is a pleasant but lightweight musical about the Iowa State Fair in the 1940s.  This version is a Rodgers & Hammerstein production from 1945 and stars Jeanne Crain as Margy Frake and Dick Haymes as her brother Wayne Frake.  Both Margy and Wayne are hoping to find love at the fair, while parents Abel (Charles Winninger) and Melissa (Fay Bainter) are preoccupied with winning state fair contests.

There are a number of pleasing musical numbers in the film including It Might As Well Be Spring, All I Owe Ioway, and Its a Grand Night for Singing. There are some humorous moments in the film too, such as when Harry Morgan (Colonel Potter of MASH) shows up as a dishonest carnival worker, and Margys mom wins a recipe contest by inadvertently submitting a mince meat pie doubly spiked with liquor.

Dana Andrews plays the city-wise news reporter who meets Margy and quickly becomes her new beau. Andrews acting was fine but he may have been a trifle old to play boyfriend to 20-ish Margy. But, the movie is just for fun and was undoubtedly a nice escape from the wartime era in which it was released.

If you like old-fashioned musicals you will most likely enjoy State Fair. The acting was good, the music pleasant, and Jeanne Crain looks wonderful.  But the story is a bit idyllic and syrupy at times. Nonetheless, I readily recommend it.",1393372800,,1349,4.670886075949367
719528,5,6303854311,This is a delightful musical with songs you'll find yourself singing long after. Kind of silly romances but fun.

Yes, I know many people like the Rogers and Hammerstein version, but this one has a charm the other two lack, as well as the presence of Will Rogers, who adds a great deal to an already enjoyable story.  It's past time for this film to be released on DVD and Blu-Ray, even if we have to buy all three versions to get this one.  The supporting cast is great- Janet Gaynor, Lew Ayres, Louise Dresser, Norman Foster and Sally Eilers- and add so much to the film, but it is Mr. Rogers' film, and he makes the most of it with a charm and humor all his own.

719733,5,6303854311,"With all due respect to the 1945 Rodgers & Hammerstein musical version, which is excellent, the 1933 non-musical original, starring Will Rogers, Janet Gaynor, and Lew Ayres, is the best rendering of this classic story of an Iowa farm family's trials and tribulations during their annual visit to the state fair.  (I'll pass on the 1962 musical remake, which inexplicably moved the fair from Iowa, where it was set in the source novel, to Texas.)

The 1933 version is gently humorous, and really gives you a good idea of what it must have been like to be at the Iowa State Fair back in those days.  Indeed, some of the background shots were done at the actual Iowa State Fair!  Will Rogers, as farmer Abel Frake, is wonderfully wry, but doesn't hog the screen -- except when he's with his character's prize-winning hog, Blue Boy.  Rogers, a major star at the time, allows the rest of the cast to shine, and they definitely take the opportunity to do so -- Janet Gaynor is lovely as daughter Margy, who wants to fall in love and does, when she meets the Des Moines Register reporter covering the fair, played by the always reliable Lew Ayres.

This is a wonderful version of a wonderful story, and Fox should release it on DVD or, preferably, Blu-ray right away!  (How about a Blu-ray set that includes all three versions of the story?!)",1373932800,6,1335,4.6075949367088604

It is a clean, wholesome movie, as are all of the musicals of Rodger's and Hammerstein.  In today's world, too many people go for the violence and sex that is so dominant today, but is not conducive to peace and love.  I am 88 years old and grew up in a world where you trusted your neighbor, you did not have to lock your doors and if you  needed help your neighbors were there for you.

719898,4,6303854311,"This set contains both the 1947 version as well as the 1962 remake.  I much prefer the older 1947 version.  It's a gentler telling of the tale.  Yes, it's a bit corny but still believable.  Family goes to the Iowa State Fair and each one has their own adventure.

The 1962 remake has good actors -Pat Boone, Ann-Margaret and others.  However when the studio updated the story to 1962 and moved the setting to Texas, they lost much of what made the original so charming.  One example was the song and dance number that Ann-Margaret does.  Seemed like it should have been in a Las Vegas casino, not a state fair stage.

It's because I didn't like the 2nd version that I rated this at 4 stars.  However, since the two versions are on separate discs, it's quite easy to just ignore it.",1354406400,2,781,4.398601398601398

719900,5,6303854311,"This is the second of three versions of essentially the same story. The first, in black-and-white dates from 1933 and starred Will Rogers and Janet Gaynor. This second and musical version of the story, in Technicolour, is built around the tale of an Iowa hog farmer and his family, and their adventures at the annual State Fair. The real focus of the plot is the love affair between the farmer's daughter (played by Jeanne Crain, whose singing voice was dubbed by Louanne Hogan) and reporter Dana Andrews, with Dick Haymes as Crain's protective big brother.

This was the only movie for which Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein wrote a score, and there are a few numbers that became standards in the popular music repertoire: `It might as well be spring', `It's a grand day for singing', and `That's for me', which became a great hit for Dick Haymes. There are also other songs that haven't stood the test of time so well out of context; but this a grand family film.

719943,5,6303854311,"Oh, my, how can I write an objective review of this movie? Answer: I cant. I was 10 years old when it came out and thought Jeanne Crain the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. I was devastated to learn that she was 10 years older than I, and I didn't have a chance. I was even more devastated years later to learn that she didn't even sing in the film, she was dubbed by Louanne Hogan, a member of the Pied Pipers singers. I had associated It Might as Well be Spring with Crain for all those years, even when I was playing it professionally as a cocktail pianist in hotel dining rooms, and it wasn't even her. Can one believe in anything? Regardless, 100 stars  see it, and you can see it with every friend and every member of your family of every age, it is the ultimate family film.",1304380800,2,785,4.130718954248366
719944,5,6303854311,"I was annoyed recently to hear a Broadway performer, being interviewed on NPR, refer to Rodgers and Hammerstein as ""old-fashioned,"" conventional, rather ""square"" theater compared to the production he was involved with.  It merely illustrated the importance of knowing what you're talking about.  Hammerstein (""Show Boat"") and Rodgers (""Oklahoma"") were Broadway's greatest innovators, incapable of writing anything as obvious, artificial, and manipulative as so many of the  musicals of the past 30 years.

""State Fair"" is no exception.  Paradoxically, it profits in part because of what it isn't: a Fred and Ginger, Gene Kelly, or big MGM production.  Each of the latter produces expectations which redound to the film's disfavor when they're not met.  ""State Fair,"" on the other hand, is a surprisingly fresh delight, always welcome for a repeat screening.  Granted, I continue to play out in my mind an alternative matching-up of the characters (Dick Haymes and Jeanne Crain simply look ""more right"" as a romantic couple than as brother and sister), but it's a small detail overmatched by the colorful photography and the overall conviviality of the production and the cast.

Another minor disappointment is the delegation of the film's outstanding musical number--""It Might As Well Be Spring""--to the voice dubbing Jeanne Crain rather than to Dick Haymes, who has never sounded better--his rich voice strong and secure yet effortless and unforced, as ""natural"" as informal Iowa conversation, turning even the lesser musical numbers into compelling highlights.  It's unlikely that R&H at the time could have guessed at the staying power of the song, equally attractive to instrumentalists and vocalists more than 60 years later (more recently, a Cheryl Bentyne version joins a Clifford Brown, Stan Getz, and 5-6 Sonny Stitt recordings of the tune in my collection).  At least the special quality of the tune was not lost on Haymes, who as a consolation to many of us would waste little time recording a glowing version for Capitol.",1301184000,,2033,5.282608695652174

When the DVD first starts to play you are FORCED to watch a video describing that it is wrong to copy a movie (Duh). The video depicts various types of theft with nasty heavy metal music.  The ability to press the menu button (and have it work) is disabled by the authors of the DVD.

This would be no different than if you sat down at a table in a restaurant and the waiter came up and lectured you in harsh terms, about the immorality of skipping out on the check and not paying.

These two `State Fair' movies (as well as the  original 1933 version) are wonderful entertainment.  But the nasty Hollywood video at the beginning completely spoils the mood, and is not appropriate for children (or anyone else with half a brain).

Wait for the DVD to be fixed before purchasing.",1298160000,6,844,4.441558441558442
720048,5,6303854311,A beautiful musical of a lost world of innocence and glorious beauty and atmosphere. It starts out perfectly and develops exactly the way you feel it should. Jeanne Crain is so pure and innocently beautiful that I don't want to know she was anything less than an angel from heaven. Bernstein said the musical is uniquely American and the subject of a State Fair is perfect. Carrousel is another musical of similar subject. I can't stop looking at this. Over and over. It touches something you wish life was about and maybe it is. It is while you watch it at least.,1293667200,,564,4.53921568627451
720049,5,6303854311,"I suppose it is just the natural progression of things. When I was younger I used to cringe at the prospect of having to watch a musical. My point of view began to change shortly after I got married at the age of 36.  My wife was a big fan of all the great musicals and so I somewhat reluctantly began to put my toe into the water. A couple of years later I had an epiphany and suddenly realized that many of these films are terrific after all.

One of the first musicals I became enamored with was Rogers and Hammerstein's 1945 classic ""State Fair"". This was this only musical Rogers and Hammerstein ever wrote directly for the silver screen and it is a dandy. The film stars Jeanne Crain as Margie, a restless young lady who feels trapped by her rural surroundings and her dreadfully dull boyfriend and Dana Andrews as newspaper reporter Pat.  The two meet on the rollercoaster and fall head over heels for each other.  Meanwhile Margie's brother Wayne (Dick Haymes) is lamenting the fact that his girlfriend was unable to go to the fair with him this year. He is kind of moping around the midway when he has a rather bizarre encounter with a young lady who turns out to be the lead vocalist of the big band performing at the fair.  Wayne is smitten with Emily (Vivian Blaine) who kinda sorta leads him on throughout the film.  He'll be sorry!  The story line also follows the exploits of Margie and Wayne's parents (Charles Winnenger and Fay Bainter) who have both entered competitions at the fair.

But as you might expect it is the marvelous music that makes ""State Fair"" such a joy to watch.  Dick Haymes was a huge recording star in the 1940's and is one of the greatest pop vocalists of all-time. You will certainly enjoy his splendid renditions of ""Isn't It Kinda Fun"", ""It's A Grand Night For Singing"" and of course ""It Might As Well Be String"" which became a huge hit record for him as well. Life was certainly much simpler in those days and hearing these wonderful tunes makes me long for them.  We enjoy this film 2 or 3 times each year and never get tired of it. There is one oddity about this film that is worth mentioning.  Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein II won the Academy Award for Best song for Margie's rendition of ""It Might As Well Be Spring"".  But oddly enough Jeanne Crain's singing voice was dubbed by a singer named Louanne Hogan.  I believe this is the only time that this has ever happened in the history of the Academy Awards.

Now I certainly can understand why some folks would look at ""State Fair"" and think it is kind of ""corny"".  And they would probably be right.  But damn it, I love it and I guess that's all that really matters.  My wife and I purchased the 60th Anniversary edition which features a whole host of extras including a copy of the 1962 remake of ""State Fair"" starring Pat Boone. In my view that version leaves a lot to be desired.  But if you have never seen the 1945 version of ""State Fair"" I urge you to give it a try.  You just might be surprised by how much you like it.  Very highly recommended!",1282608000,3,3057,4.376991150442477

720051,5,6303854311,"Nicholas Ray's westerns have always been highly regarded in France, but it's only in the last ten years or so that Americans have begun to take them seriously. Why is that? The French were always seeing them from a distance, whereas Ray's contemporary audience was familiar with so many tropes and cliches that they anitcipated them, and couldn't see clearly beyond what was obvious, nor discern anything but what they believed to be apparent. A similar misfortune eclipsed the 1962 version of State Fair, which was considered a stinker in its day. Because it was a vehicle to promote the musical careers of Pat Boone, Bobby Darin, and Ann Margret, few people saw beyond that; thinking they were being tricked, they refused to see it as anything but a gimmick. After almost fifty years, that cynicism has given way to either nostalgia, or an appreciation of history. The 1962 version of State Fair is American Graffiti uncontrived; as it happened, and not as Richard Dreyfuss remembered it.  It features much more wit and humour than the 1945 screenplay, and both the singing and acting are better than the earlier version.",1277424000,5,1123,4.910526315789474

While  watching the madcap and romantic rural adventures of this good hearted, middle American family a couldn't help feeling as though I had been sucked through some sort of time warp to a time and place far more distant than a state fair in Iowa circa 1945. Was the world ever as simple, honest and wonderful as depicted here?

Whether pure fantasy or real this film is definitely a nostalgic and wholesome viewing experience displaying the best of what ""Old Hollywood"" had to offer. The story line is a bit nave (or maybe we're just too jaded today) but enjoyable, the music fun and beautifully performed and the color exquisite.

While it's not an R&H musical -- which I guess gave the '62 Pat Boone musical re-make an edge for inclusion here -- it's probably the most accurate screen production of the best-selling novel by Phil Stong.  With Will Rogers, Janet Gaynor, and Lew Ayres as the stars, and a very low-key, gentle sense of humor that brings out the warmth of the story, I'm sure that many would see it as the real inspiration for the excellent R&H musical film from a dozen years later.  Heck, the 1933 film even includes extensive background shots of the actual Iowa State Fair, although I don't think the stars were photographed on location.  (Frankly, I could live without the Pat Boone version, which unaccountably transfers the state fair from its Iowa origin to Texas, although I do like Tom Ewell and Alice Faye very much.)

Featuring the duo's only score written exclusively for Hollywood, and based on the novel by Phil Stong (which had been previously filmed, very successfully, in 1933 with Janet Gaynor and Will Rogers), the musical STATE FAIR is full of homespun charm and lovely performances, enhanced by Technicolor photography and of course the accomplished R&H score.

During their annual visit to the Iowa State Fair, the Frake family enjoy many adventures.  Proud patriarch Abel (Charles Winninger) has high hopes for his champion swine Blueboy; and his wife Melissa (Fay Bainter) enters the mincemeat and pickles contest...with hilarious results.  Their children, however, have romance on their minds.  Wayne (Dick Haymes) falls head over heels for flashy bandstand singer Emily (Vivian Blaine), whilst Margy (Jeanne Crain) finds the man of her dreams in the worldly-wise journalist Pat (Dana Andrews).  Rodgers and Hammerstein's score features the beautiful Academy Award-winning song ""It Might as Well Be Spring"", not to mention a rich tunestack of ""That's for Me"", ""All I Owe Ioway"", ""Isn't It Kinda Fun?"" and ""It's a Grand Night for Singing"".

The cast is simply superb.  Charles Winninger, who had been the original Capt'n Andy in Oscar Hammerstein II's ""Show Boat"", is a warm presence as the father, with Fay Bainter (Oscar-winner for ""Jezebel"") also heavily scoring as the wife.  Dick Haymes, with his clean-cut good looks and smooth crooning voice, is likewise a perfect fit for Wayne.  Vivian Blaine, in probably her best film appearance up to that time, is a postive delight as Emily, and with her flaming red hair and gorgeous gowns, we can understand completely why Wayne would fall so quickly under her spell!  Her film career all but ended with this movie but she later went on to find her greatest role as Miss Adelaide in the original Broadway production of ""Guys and Dolls"", later reprising her efforts for the film version.

Just as the 1933 version was intended as a star vehicle for Janet Gaynor, so too was this 1945 version.  Jeanne Crain was the main starlet at Twentieth Century-Fox and the studio tailored this film as a showcase for her beauty and all-American wholesomeness.  But, Crain was not a singer, so her voice was dubbed by Louanne Hogan (who later made a career out of dubbing for Crain in other films like ""Margie"" and ""You Were Meant for Me"").

The DVD looks fabulous and the original Technicolor negatives have been beautifully-restored for this new release.  Audio commentary is provided by film historian Richard Barrios and Tom Briggs who co-wrote the subsequent 1996 Broadway version of the musical.

But the fun does not end there...

This new DVD set also includes the seldom-seen or heard 1962 remake of STATE FAIR.  Since Oscar Hammerstein had by this point passed away, Richard Rodgers went back to the drawing-board and wrote several new songs for the score (""This Isn't Heaven"", ""Willing and Eager"", ""More Than Just a Friend"", ""Never Say 'No' to a Man"", ""The Little Things in Texas"") joining the classic numbers from the '45 version.

Apart from the re-setting of the story to the annual Texas State Fair, the rest of the story plays out mostly in the same way including all the favourite storylines (the lovesick Blueboy and the spiking of Melissa's mincemeat).  But to keep in step with modern audiences, a few of the characters were slightly changed with Wayne (played by Pat Boone) now a race car driver.

The performances here are also very fine.  Tom Ewell, as Abel, gives a wonderful gravity to the story and Alice Faye (returning to movies after a 30-year retirement) invests a lot of heart, sincerity and knowing comedy to the role of Melissa.  Young starlet Pamela Tiffin, as Margy, is the very picture of wide-eyed innocence and Pat Boone brings a lot of depth and earnestness to Wayne.  Ann-Margret (at the very apex of her sex-kitten phase) and Bobby Darin are likewise wonderful as the objects of affection for Wayne and Margy respectively.

Filmed primarily on location, this STATE FAIR is a lot more expansive and cinematic than the 1945 version.  The musical numbers are very well-executed, the big highlight perhaps Ann-Margret's steamy rendition of ""Isn't It Kinda Fun?"" with a group of red velvet-clad beatnik male dancers.  Pat Boone's jubilant ""That's for Me"" and the aching ballad ""It Might as Well Be Spring"" (dubbed for Tiffin by voice double Anita Gordon) are also well-staged.  Of the new numbers, perhaps the best is ""This Isn't Heaven"", a perfect dreamy ballad for crooner Bobby Darin.  Pat Boone and Ann-Margret also make good with the pretty ""Willing and Eager"".  ""The Little Things in Texas"" could have turned into a throwaway number but Alice Faye and Tom Ewell hit the mark beautifully.

The CinemaScope image has been cleaned up very well for the film's DVD debut.  Audio commentary is provided by Pat Boone who offers some cherished memories of working with his co-stars and director Jose Ferrer.

Also featured on this 2-disc set is a documentary ""From Page to Screen to Stage"" charting the making of the various STATE FAIR's as well as the 1996 Broadway musical version; the pilot for the TV series starring Vera Miles and an excerpt from the 1954 Rodgers and Hammerstein/General Foods TV special, of Mary Martin performing ""It Might as Well Be Spring"".

720290,5,6303854311,"In addition to Cinderella and The King and I, State Fair is probably my favorite of the numerous Rodgers and Hammersetin musicals, and has always been so.  I have had the 1945 version on VHS for years and was always satisfied with it; the reason I bought this 2 disc DVD set was because it included the 1962 Cinemascope remake as well, which had been out of print for years.  The 1945 original is great--a classic--but the 1962 remake is my preferred version.  Maybe it is because the whole thing is opened up a lot more, thanks to the location filming, widescreen CinemaScope picture and stereophonic soundtrack.  Or maybe it is just because I'm a sucker for 1960s musicals.

The video transfers are great.  The video transfer of the 1962 film is a vast improvement over my VHS dub I made when this film aired on FMC a few years ago.  The 1945 version is, of course, essential, but it's nice to have the 1962 version available in a beautiful restored print.  My only gripe about this package is that the glorious 1933 non-musical version was not included here where it could easily have been.  That version, starring Janet Gaynor, is arguably the best of all 3 versions, but has never been released on video or DVD.  It airs on FMC from time to time; do see it if you ever get a chance.",1139961600,3,1287,4.461538461538462
720291,4,6303854311,"The original 1945 State Fair is downright corny, and there lies its charm, in that very corny, utopian 1940s vision of rural America.  The film also boasts a pleasant (some would say bland) quartet of leading stars (Jeanne Crain, Dana Andrews, Dick Haymes, Vivian Blaine), scene-stealing supporting players (reliable veterans Fay Bainter & Charles Winninger as the parents), and a fairly enjoyable score written for the screen by Rodgers and Hammerstein.  The stagey look and the intense Technicolor that characterized 1940s Fox musicals perfectly fits with the film's idealized image of rural America.  In short, the 1945 State Fair is a pleasant, if not particularly memorable, musical.

The 1962 remake is simply mediocre.  The great Puerto Rican actor Jose Ferrer was clearly out of his element directing a movie musical.  (An Oscar-winner for ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" and a multiple Tony winning-actor and stage director, Ferrer never made it as a film director.) The idea to ""update"" the material was mistaken, especially the decision to give the story a more ""naturalistic"" look by filming outdoors.  In doing so, they took away all the charm of the original.  The new songs by Richard Rodgers are also mediocre.  The new cast is not much help.  Pamela Tiffin and Pat Boone are actually blander than Jeanne Crain and Dick Haymes.  Tiffin, in particular, doesn't make much of an impression as the female lead.  Bobby Darin and especially Ann-Margret are a lot more fun, but even though she brings some much-needed life to the movie, her contemporary sex appeal doesn't really fit with the film.  1940s Fox musical star Alice Faye (who would have probably been in the original if she hadn't walked out of the studio) came out of retirement to do this film, but she was reportedly unhappy through the shoot and didn't care for her co-star (Tom Ewell, apparently she wanted Don Ameche) and her disatisfaction shows on-screen.  Quite frankly, judging by Ewell's performance and the film's results, I can't blame her.  Still, its great that Fox released both films together.  I doubt that few people (other than die-hard fans of Boone, Darin, Faye, and Ann-Margret) would have cared to buy or rent the 1962 film otherwise.",1133308800,3,2219,5.038356164383561

720293,3,6303854311,"Among the musicals that Richard Rodgers and Roger Oscar Hammerstein II worked on together State Fair might be the most anonymous.  It is also the only musical that these two legendary filmmakers and stage creators intentionally directed for the silver screen.  The film still contains the same positive attitude and upbeat performances that have been seen in Oklahoma! (1955) and South Pacific (1958).  Yet there is a significant difference between this musical and their later musical inventions, as the music in State Fair lacks the memorable spirit that the other musicals hold.  Nonetheless, State Fair managed to win an Oscar for best song for its It Might as Well Be Spring.

The trademark in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals often display an overtly whimsical optimism, which also surfaces through every aspect of State Fair.  The blissful and pleasant music generates a fixed state of hopefulness with the performances by the cast enhance the extreme gleefulness in front of the camera.  The mise-en-scene delivers a strong studio setting presence, which accentuates mood of the artificial and wishful environment.  In modern time, it might feel out dated to the point of a sublimely dreamlike vision, but it is also within this quirky happiness that a wonderful musical journey emerges.  It should be approached like an aged wine.  Meaning, if improper method has been employed it might spoil the cinematic experience, which could result in a similar experience when observing poorly applied make-up.

State Fair opens with the song Our State Fair while Dave Miller (Percy Kilbride), friend of the family, visits the Frake farm for business purposes.  The song functions like an introduction to the family and the way of life on an Iowan farm in the 1940s, and the social importance of the State Fair.  Shortly after the opening song, the audience gets to hear the Oscar winning song It Might as Well Be Spring sung by the daughter Margy (Jeanne Crain) who in mid August suffers by the excitement of the State Fair and the struggles of love.  Meanwhile, the mother Melissa (Fay Bainter) prepares her minced meat and pickles for the State Fair competition, as the father Abel (Charles Winninger) shows off his hopeful prize-winning hog Blue Boy to Dave.

When Dave hears Abel's admiration for Blue Boy's sheer size and superiority, he shares his open pessimism with Abel by quoting his motto ""for every good, there is bad.""  It turns into a small argument between the two farmers that they eventually settle through a bet.  Abel suggests a five-dollar bet that nothing bad will happen to the Frake family at the State Fair, while Dave has a completely different idea.  It should be noted that many farmers have a true wisdom with reality, as they often see accidents and deaths through their farm animals and the dangers around a farm.  However, this is never shown in the film.

In the barn the son Wayne, performed by vocal talent Dick Haymes, practices for one of the State Fair ring tossing games, as he intends to get back on the owner of the game.  Later, at the fair Wayne meets a red-haired beauty at the ring game whose presence strikes him with arrows of love.  Margy also meets the newspaperman Pat (Dana Andrews) that she becomes infatuated with while her worries about the future with the goody-goody boy Harry simply vanish.  The fair offers an opportunity for the whole Frake family to experience things they cannot achieve at home such as success, failures, and love.  Even the statement made by Dave rings true, as the audience will uncover that there is something good and bad in everything.  The only difference with Dave is that it is how you approach the situation, optimistically or pessimistically.  Thus, learn from Dave and do not bet on other people's misfortunes.

State Fair brings out some worthwhile notions, laughter, and drama through a music and dance.  With a positive frame of mind, the audience will most likely enjoy this film a little more.  However, it is not one of those films with a tune that sticks in the mind, or that will allow the audience to remember the film some months later.  The songs could have been better, and the story a little less flimsy in its narrative.  Yet, this musical offers a cinematic experience worth seeing when time is not pressing.

On the second disc the audience can uncover the remake of Stare Fair (1962), which is a rather disappointing experience compared to the film.  Here the story is set in the early 1960s and it feels a little silly compared to the 1945 version, yet it follows a similar path with its own adaptation incorporated.  However, this time the story is set in Texas instead of Iowa and most of the film seems to have been shot on location, which brings a more real touch to the story.  Despite the genuine approach, the 1962 version falls flat on its face compared to its musical predecessor.

The 60th Anniversary Edition of State Fair is a gem for people worshiping musicals.  However, if the viewer desires a good narrative and fascinating intrigue then this DVD will only suffice for a viewing and not a purchase.  Out of the two films, the 1945 version of State Fair is far better, even though it feels more fictitious.  Thus, personally I can only recommend it for an evening rental when nothing else is available.",1132185600,6,5327,4.837748344370861
720294,5,6303854311,"I've always enjoyed the warm and fuzzy 1945 version of State Fair as I'm a fan of Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews.  I found the 1962 musical remake just so-so with Alice Faye looking somewhat bored and it really being just a showcase for Pat Boone and Ann-Margret.

The releasing studio should have included the 1933 adaptation with Janet Gaynor and Will Rogers.  This non-musical interpretation is almost a duplicate of the 1945 entry scene for scene and even includes some language rather surprising as this pre-code movie was made before the Hays Office censors got a solid foothold in the Hollywood scene.

So enjoy the 1945 and 1962 versions and try to catch the 1933 rendering on late night cable. It really is worth a view!",1132012800,10,728,4.708661417322834
720295,5,6303854311,"This warm and wonderful film is one of the truly great American musicals, yet is also the least talked about. A terrific cast and some of the best songs Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein II ever gave birth to make this Walter Lang film a real treat. It will always bring a smile to your face no matter how many times you see it. It is much like ""On Moonlight Bay"" in that it is a fine family film with a rural setting, nearly bursting with  traditional American values. The fact that it contains some great songs that are worked into the story in a natural and not artificial way is a big bonus.

The Frake family in Iowa are all ready for their annual and much beloved trip to the State Fair. Young and pretty Margy Frake (Jeanne Crain) is excited that she might meet the fella that will change her life. Her brother Wayne (Dick Haymes) has been practicing the ring-toss all year so he can get even with the carny who gave him a bum prize last year. Their pa, Abel (Charles Winninger), is excited about his pet boar, Blueboy, winning the grand prize this year. Percy Kilbride has a fine part as Abel's old pal, Dave Miller. They have a five dollar bet on whether they'll all have a good time at the fair this year.

Their mother, Melissa (Fay Bainter), is entering her pickles and mincemeat and has dreams that she will win this year over the snooty Mrs. Metcalf. Pa sneaks some brandy into her mincemeat when she's not looking that might just give her the edge this year. Donald Meek has a funny role as one of the judges, Hippenstahl, who is delighted by the taste, and the aftereffects, of Melissa's mincemeat!

Dana Andrews is a reporter for the Des Moines Register named Pat, who thinks he's seen the world until he meets the sweet Margy. They spend the three days together as much as possible, but once their time is over, he is on his way to Chicago for a big promotion. Margy loves him, of course, and he may discover he can't live without her either.

Wayne will meet and have a romance of sorts with a beautiful singer, Emily Edwards (Vivian Blane). But his taste of the real world will make him appreciate his girl back home, Eleanor (Jane Nigh). It is very funny as he and his sister make up excuses to ditch each other and have their romances. Even Blueboy gets hit by the love bug, as the ""pretty"" Esmerelda catches his eye!

The spectacle and fun of the State Fair and what it means in the lives of the Frake family is captured beautifully by the color photography of Leon Shamroy. It should get listed as one of the stars of this film. Adapted by Sonya Levien and Paul Green from a novel by Philip Stong, this is a heartwarming and happy look at America's heartland and all that is good about our past.

Songs like ""It Might As Well Be Spring"" and ""It's A Grand Night For Singing"" are easy to take and don't seem forced at all. You never get that ""they're going to sing now"" feel for any of the numbers. They are very enjoyable and help move the story along. ""It Might As Well Be Spring"" won the Academy Award. The music is marvelous, and so is this film.

Everyone is just great here, with the lovely Jeanne Crain a particular standout. Harry Morgan has a nice bit as the carny Wayne gets even with, and if you look quick for Coleen Grey you might catch her. Charles Winninger is winning, as are Fay Bainter and Dick Haymes. Percy Kilbride was always amusing and this was one of Dana Andrews' best roles after the magnificent ""Laura.""

This film will make you nostalgic. It has the feel of sitting on your front porch in the middle of summer with a glass of iced tea, the scent of honeysuckle in the air and Virginia Creepers twisting around the arbor. This is one of the best American musicals and one you don't want to miss.",1129420800,43,3747,4.349070100143061
720296,5,6303854311,"""State Fair"" is a sweet and charming musical from Rogers and Hammerstein.  As the story opens, the Frake family leaves their farm to go to the grand Iowa state fair.  Dad Abel is entering his prize hog in competition, Mother Melissa is hoping her mincemeat will win a prize, and kids Wayne and Margy are looking for love.  They both meet special someones at the fair, but what will happen when the fair closes?

Jeanne Crain and Dick Haymes are just great as the naive siblings, full of clean-cut country charm.  They sing their way down the midway with tunes like, ""It Might as Well be Spring"" and ""It's a Grand Night for Singing.""  The lovely Vivian Blaine plays the sophisticated singer that catches Wayne's eye, and Dana Andrews is the reporter who sweeps Margy off her feet.  It's all as predictable as can be, and yet it's fun instead of sappy.  The stars are beautiful and talented, the songs hearken back to a gentler time, the technicolor is vibrant, and the old-fashioned fun of the summer fair is contagious.  Turn your way-back machine to 1945 and enjoy this nostalgic family film.

720297,4,6303854311,"Normally my title for this review would seem weird. However, most of us who want the 1945 version on dvd already have it. I've been waiting for the 1962 version for long time, and now it's coming out, but the only way I can get it is to purchse the 1945 version again. The 1962 version should also be available by itself.

I won't say much about the 1945 version (Jeannie Crain/Dana Andrews) since there are already a lot of reviews for this movie. I will admit that the 1945 version is probably the best.

The 1962 version (Ann-Marget, Pat Boone) is enjoyable, but for some reason isn't as entertaining as the 1945 version. However,

it does have it's moments. One of them is the song/dance number that Ann-Margret does in the Fair Park Bandshell. This is one of the best song/dance numbers in the movies. Another great thing for me is the fact that the 1962 version was mostly filmed at Fair Park (the home of the Texas State Fair) in Dallas, Texas. The opening, and ending, are filmed at their farm (located somewhere), and the car race scene I've heard was filmed at the Oklahoma State Fairgrounds as Fair Park no longer had a racetrack (2 previous ones had been torn down). The rest of the movie was filmed at Fair Park, which has been in it's current location since 1886. I'm from the Dallas area, and it is nice seeing Fair Park as the setting of a movie.

Also of interest in the 1962 version is that Alice Faye came out of a self-imposed retirement (during WWII) to do this film, and supposedly hated the experience. She was used to making movies in a studio, and by 1962 things had changed dramatically.

The movie was made on location, in the Dallas summer heat. You can't tell that she was unhappy with the situation. In fact, her acting is probably the best in the movie. After all, she is, and always has been, a very good actress.

To sum up, both movies are enjoyable to watch, if for different reasons. The 1962 version even has a few new songs written for it.",1125792000,6,1977,4.417582417582418
720358,5,6303854311,"There's something incredibly heart-tugging about this story of a farm family's trip to the Iowa State Fair. Each family member is going for a different purpose: the mom to win a pickle contest, the dad to win the hog contest, the eldest son to win the ring-toss (and get revenge on the swindler holding it) and the young daughter to get away from the farm and the only available bachelor in the county, for whom she has little interest. The daughter is the focus of the story as she goes from moping and being uninterested in the fair to finding the love (and having the time) of her life.

For any romantics who have ever dreamt of having a fling or meeting the love of their life while on vacation, this story has an emotional irresistibility. Hopeless romantics watching alone will be hard-pressed to hold back tears and couples hard-pressed not to end up in each other's arms.

The Rodgers and Hammerstein music is a real treat -- both delightful and catchy. You may find that you don't realize how good the music and lyrics are until you catch yourself humming or singing the songs days later.

This is perhaps my favorite musical. It has the music, the charming setting and the emotionally-involving story. I highly recommend it to anyone of any age, but especially young couples and hopeless romantics (especially dreamy-eyed, young girls). It is truly a great musical and one of the first.",1099267200,15,1397,4.6938775510204085

It is about a time when people got excited about spending three days at a county fair, riding on ferris wheels and eating candy apples.  Our world may be a lot more sophisticated and technologically savvy nowadays, but I can't help thinking that we've lost a lot of the fun that our grandparents had.  This movie brings it back.

720360,3,6303854311,"I rented ""State Fair"" this weekend to watch with my brother and his wife, and the idea that most often poppped into our heads was, ""This doesn't seem like a farmhouse family to me!"" I mean, when you consider how Aunt Em's farm looks in ""Wizard of Oz"", this family is surely living high on the hog! They've got a stunning kitchen and both children have brand-new extremely well-made wardrobes--part of our unintentionally cynical enjoyment was to comment on these kinds of details that make sure you know you're in the era when America was emerging as the top nation in the world, and the Great Depression was well behind.
I thought the best performances were handed in by the older generation: the mom and pop were appealing and conveyed very nice people. Donald Meek was especially great as the pickled mincemeat judge who keeps following Ma through the fair. I had my difficulties with the romantic couples. I was just watching Dana Andrews again in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and he was reminding me of that character again here. It's a man who smiles with his lips only--it never extends to his eyes. A troubled man who is not really capable of being happy. I don't think Jeanne Crain (or Teresa Wright in the other film) would be doing a wise thing in marrying him because of this. I suppose it's also worth commenting on that Jeanne's parents haven't the foggiest clue that she's even met Dana Andrews, let alone is going to marry him at the end. They think she's going to marry her fiance who is rather unfairly characterized as a bore. He actually sounds like a fellow who's going to be very successful as a modern farmer, like a Bill Gates of the dairy world. His chief crime in un-romance seems to be that he wears glasses. If she would just be honest with him, maybe he could be as romantic as she'd like. Not very cricket to be engaged to a man you don't love, you know, and she already is at the outset.
Then there's the son. He's got a girl he seems to be sweet on back home. She's a very lovely blonde, as we see during his telephone call. Then off he goes to the fair and takes up with the band singer, who isn't nearly as lovely as the girl he's already secured back home. He has no compunction, though, about pursuing the band singer; he totally dumps mentally the girl back home, whose only crime was that she couldn't come to the fair because a relative was sick. So how nice is he? Of course, Dick Haymes has a good voice, but otherwise he appeared to be miscast in this film; as one reviewer noted, he seemed to fit right in to the posh party thrown by the showbiz folks, and really he should be a fish out of water. My brother and sister-in-law  thought he had a strange-looking face, and then my brother concluded he was supposed to be a spin on then-popular Joe Di Maggio. He more reminded me of the pre-cortisone treatment JFK.
So, ""State Fair"" does not rank that high on the Rodgers and Hammerstein geiger counter. It's not a bad score, though it's not the most memorable thing I'd ever heard. ""Grand Night for Singing"" (my personal favorite song) morphed in later years into ""Real Nice Clambake"" from ""Carousel""--listen to see if you agree with me. I thought Fox did a creditable job of a rip-off MGM musical. Better things were to come from R&H in the next few years. ""State Fair""'s strongest point is that it's lovely to look at in its technicolor glory. So sit back and enjoy it for what it's worth.",1047168000,,3433,4.431962025316456

I was disappointed by the audio and video quality of the DVD to be quite honest. The audio is so low that I really had to crank up my receiver to get an acceptable volume. Afterall, this is a musical isn't it? In the early part of the film when Jeanne Crain is singing ""It Might As Well Be Spring"", there seemed to be little gnats flying around her face. In reality they were spots on the film that SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP. This condition improved later on, but come on! These Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals should have been given a lot more loving care than they have received. I say this because other musicals in the series also have problems. The audio and video on State Fair needs some restoration, the kind that is afforded other classic films. Otherwise, a worthwhile purchase.",995932800,52,966,4.402234636871508

There is so much sadness in our present society and this movie makes me nostalgic for when I was growing up.  I love the music, the costumes and the relationships.

7853784,3,6303854311,"It looks like most reviewers rated this musical much higher than myself so bear that in mind.
This is minor Rodgers and Hammerstein, more ""Music Man:"" than ""Oklahoma"". The 1945 film does feature the neon bright color of Technicolor. The songs are just fair and the musical numbers are lacking in energy and excitement except for the work of Viviane Blaine. There is an interesting feature on the history of the book and music.
The 1962 version is in Cinemascope and the color is the Deluxe process so a little more natural. It also used fewer studio scenes so it was less claustrophobic. There were additional songs, none of which are memorable. The performances were a little bland with Ann-Margret the stand out.
Neither film is a classic musical but may yield some pleasure if you are in a receptive mood.",1512950400,,808,4.73758865248227
