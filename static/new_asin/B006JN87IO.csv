The length of time was perfect and I would have loved to seen him in person.  He's funny,witty, and keeps you laughing the entire time and there are a few times he had to laugh himself at a joke he said, So if you want to laugh buy Gary Owen True Story.",1350345600,,357,3.7466666666666666
4994600,5,B006JN87IO,"I laughed soo much i had cramps in my stomach and tears in my eyes. His views on having bi-racial children had me cracking up. I can related as my son is bi-racial so that made it that much more funny as Gary likes to quote ""true story""! My husband and I joke all the time now from his joke on going to the ""westcoast"" once you see the dvd you'll know why!!! LMBO",1335830400,4,363,3.918918918918919

( Labor Day weekend  2011) when Mayweather and company came in... I didn't know what was going on..They were a large group, mainly men ,they went to the wrong seats (the show had already started) they had to go to another aisle, everyone was watching, Gary started cracking jokes. I'm so happy to see the DvD has been released, Gary was perfect!!!

4994612,5,B006JN87IO,"I had never heard of Gary Owens before so I decided to watch it on Showtime.

When he first came out I thought okay what is this?  Then I saw that his audience was 90% black so I was really curious.

I laughed so hard I had tears running down my face.  He talks about his white up bringing as well as his induction into the black community by way of his black wife and compares the two cultures.  He also talks about the challenges of raising bi-racial children.  Of course he exaggerates a little here and there but that is how it is done to get the point across.

I think the funniest part was his comparison of the white church service and the black Southern Baptist Church.  I grew up in the Southern Baptist Church and the things that he said were my complaints as a child.  In other words I could relate.

I also love it that he is just a comic not a white comic trying to be a black comic with white skin.",1354233600,8,912,4.073033707865169
