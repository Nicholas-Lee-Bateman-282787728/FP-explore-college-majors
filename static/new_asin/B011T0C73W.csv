7342098,5,B011T0C73W,"Excellent fun!  Entertaining stories with a cast of characters you can thoroughly enjoy.  Miss Fisher is an independent woman, ahead of her time, who, in addition to solving murders, does what she can to help those around her.  The other characters are well rounded with their own stories, strengths and weaknesses.  Top notch acting.  The mysteries are interesting without being gory.  There is romance.

7342128,5,B011T0C73W,"I want more episodes. They are delightful and fun to watch!  Murder mysteries in general have lost the entertainment element of humor and fun---way too dark for me.  Can't stand the way Foyle's War and Midsommer Murder have lost their humor.  If I want dark, all I have to do is follow politics.  No thank you.  Miss Fisher's was a delightful escape into fantasy, and of course, love the women's lib attitude as well!",1504483200,2,417,4.581081081081081

7342154,3,B011T0C73W,"These are pretty good mysteries. The only drawback is that Miss Fisher has the urges of a cat in heat. If it moves, she's after it. Her indiscriminate pursuit of the next male do nothing for the story lines. To the contrary, they take away from the plots. Tiresome!",1492300800,,265,4.428571428571429

7342156,5,B011T0C73W,"The Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries are such a delightful period piece.  The producers have done an excellent job re-creating post WWI Australia.  The characters are enjoyable, and the murders are not gruesome.  There is not a lot of interpersonal drama to detract from the individual stories.",1491782400,,290,5.260869565217392

7342159,2,B011T0C73W,"Season 3 seemed uneven, as if the writers have changed.  Also, I'm not sure why they spent so much time on Phryne's father - perhaps he's a famous actor.  I would have liked to see more of Phryne and Jack instead.  Finally, it was a particularly short season with only 8 episodes.  Budget cuts?",1490659200,3,294,4.388888888888889

7342169,5,B011T0C73W,"Just as enjoyable as the previous seasons.  Story lines wove in actual historical details, such as the poisoning of the women who painted the radio active dials of watches. The script writer did make one error.  The final episode involved a lecture about the expanding universe.  Phrinie and Jack are talking about the stars getting more distant, and Jack says, ""and England is getting farther away."". ???  Wrong.  The Earth is not expanding, and no one was talking about Plate Tectonics, and the movement of continents.  Other than that, the scripts were fine.",1485302400,,561,4.978494623655914

7342190,5,B011T0C73W,"The actors are all comfortable with their characters, full of and fun and their own lives until Miss Fisher calls upon them.  Miss Fisher's costumes are extraordinary.  I like to watch this series just to see the fabulous fabrics!  Plots are challenging as well,  although not overwhelming. Miss Fisher is just excellent.  Sometimes feel that her character is on her own with her flirting with her cop friend.  He just doesn't seem to be there for her.  Although it has the feel of English, it is good to be reminded that it is Australian.  Would love to see more seasons.  shark",1479254400,,579,4.653465346534653
7342191,5,B011T0C73W,"These are fun if you like murder mysteries or period pieces (even better if you're a fan of both). Miss Fisher is a bit of a trollop, but if the lead character was male no one would think anything of it. At the time of this review the first two seasons are available for streaming on Acorn. There was talk of a season four but it never materialized - too bad.",1478822400,,359,4.070422535211268

7342207,3,B011T0C73W,"Season One was 1080i, 25fps, as it was meant to be seen. If you are looking at Miss Fisher on Blu-ray, sadly, the first season was the only one released with the correct timing. Season Two and Season Three are both slowed down, way down, pitch lowered and timing completely ruined, in order to convert to 1080p. I highly recommend a purchase of Season One but if you want to see Two and Three, go for a 576i DVD from overseas and a region free player, or you can chance it and suffer through the slowed down version that puts me to sleep. Plus side, 24fps conversions like this work as well as Melatonin. Good luck making your selections.",1475884800,3,638,4.369747899159663

The plots all seem a bit tired; there's not enough action with the minor characters of Bert and Cec, Mr. Butler, and doctor McMillan, and what happened to Jane?  I don't think the story line of Phryne's father is at all interesting.  Seasons 1 and 2 had unique stories that are just missing from this season.  The spark and spontaneity seems to have gone.",1474156800,8,501,4.533333333333333

7342239,4,B011T0C73W,"I absolutely adore this series. Nathan Page is just amazing and all the characters are so well crafted. I don't think I've laughed out loud so many times watching a mystery! Season 2 is probably my favorite. Season 3 however, while I'm really glad it was made seems to be falling short on a number of accounts. It became obvious a couple episodes in that they'd had money trouble. Specific opening shots from previous seasons were re-used (three times in one case). Fryne's wardrobe also took a hit, with her re-wearing tops multiple times (never happened in previous seasons), or that basic muslin bucket hat and coat combo worn in season 2 being extremely overly used in season 3 (my least favorite outfit of hers). Essie's makeup was less en pointe, Jack re wore the same tie in many episodes. Misc visual things your mind picks up but you may not put your finger on. I'm hoping they get the green light and the $$$ for a season 4, but I can see how they pushed to wrap up 3 as best as they were able with what they had. Because of Davis' age anything more than a couple year gap will probably de facto end the series, but I'm still going to hold out hope they find a angel investor. It truly is a remarkable show and all the actors are incredibly talented!",1469664000,12,1260,4.388888888888889

7342263,5,B011T0C73W,"The delectable - and somewhat dangerous - Phryne Fisher is back for another series of adventures in the Roaring Twenties and it's a season of surprises that should delight viewers of this most original detective program from Down Under.
Miss Fisher and her companion Dot, in addition to solving crimes on a Royal Australian Air Force base and other unusual locales, spend much of this season dealing with some highly personal issues as well. Phryne and her police counterpart, Inspector Jack Robinson, are growing closer and closer on a personal level while Dot's engagement to Constable Hugh Collins seems less likely to result in marriage for reasons that have little to do with love. These personal issues add a bit of tension to the season's story lines that hasn't been as evident in the previous two. Some people will not like that, however, I must say that I did because it makes both characters more ""human"" and, therefore, more accessible.
The mysteries themselves are as intriguing as ever ranging from the murder of an RAAF pilot to the killing of three young street kids.
The verdict: Series star Essie Davis and her companions once again deliver the goods in an excellent season of great storytelling.",1465430400,10,1214,4.926829268292683

7342295,3,B011T0C73W,"The show is a cute simple rendition of pretty familiar mystery plots with a character somewhat like the Phrynne of the novels( though clearly older) but only somewhat.  Many characters from the books are missing in action and/or changed in function - one or two or, well, more.  I best compare it to the current Father Brown series wherein  Father Brown is not a well travelled clergyman and the important ex- thief who should be working with him as they travel is still just a thief and FB hardly ever travels here. I.e. both are fun little mystery hours that are not a patch on the books and that is a real shame as FB has had manymuch better outings and Phrynne has had none (on film/video).  Very depressing as a fan of the books and the much greater stories they hold - which the shows should be using!!!!!!!",1460332800,,813,4.436241610738255

The rest of the cast are back as well including Ashleigh Cummings (Dot), Hugo Johnstone-Burt (Hugh Collins), Richard Bligh (Mr. Butler), Travis McMahon (Burt), Anthony Sharpe (Cec), Miriam Margolyes (Aunt Prudence) and Tammy Macintosh (Dr. Mac) and they all still work well together.

If you haven't seen the show MISS FISHER'S MURDER MYSTERIES is based in part on a character named ""Phryne (Fry-Nee) Fisher"" who is a flapper and super sleuth, featured in books by Kerry Greenwood (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cocaine-Blues-A-Phryne-Fisher-Mystery-Phryne-Fisher-Mysteries/dp/159058385X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cocaine Blues: A Phryne Fisher Mystery (Phryne Fisher Mysteries)</a>). The show takes place in Australia, during the '20s and I can't get enough!

This season has Inspector Jack Robinson (Page) and Phryne (Davis) getting closer, with Dot (Cummings) and Hugh (Johnstone-Burt) tying the knot. Of course there's murder throughout and we get to go along for the ride.

There's also 36:27-minutes of special featurettes, with a ""play-all"" selection or you can just watch one or two, that talk about the sets, costumes, the story lines and the characters. Also included is a 7-minute character clips (these are the actors in character telling you about the shows, probably commercial teasers in AUS TV), an 8-minute long ""Mr. Butler's Drink of the Week"" (featuring Richard Bligh in character as Phryne's butler ""Mr. Butler"" making cocktails), and behind-the-scenes photo gallery.

I hope there will be a season 4 for ""Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries"" because it's such a fun and likable series.

Start out with the complete set from Series 1 through Series 3.  It will blend into the next chapter of a wonderful character with her assistant Dot and her life with this wonderful woman.  Some of the episodes are so feel good, you feel like it's Christmas.  Phyrne shows what a wonderful person can do to bring happiness to so many people even the father she argues with, with love and understanding, it does the heart good.  All her actions shows what a better person we could be in difficult situations which correspond with her solving mysteries with Inspector Jack Robinson, played by Nathan Page.  Their constant bantering back and forth is a joy to behold.  Essie Davis, as Phryne is wonderful and wears the roaring twenties clothes to perfection.  Aunt Prudence, another wonderful character is a joy to watch, Ashleigh Cummings is lovely as Dot and her romance with the good Constable is a pleasure also.  Her suitor is played by Hugo Johnstone-Burt.  Phyrne's butler is such a gentleman butler, we all wish we had one in our family.  All in all, this set is wonderful and you will love having Miss Fisher in your collection of DVD's.  I only wish they would make more episodes as I was sad when the series ended with Series 3.

Her astuteness for crime solving is clever and her budding interest with the dapper Inspector Robinson is even more fun to watch.  The actor portraying the Inspector also does an excellent job of looking at her in a manner that conveys both admiration and adoration.  I was a little disappointed that in this series they do have the Constable forsaking his faith in order to please Dorothy, but she does give a beautiful and beatific smile on her wedding day.  A couple of the episodes recycle themes from previous seasons, such as the magic show setting and some more communist plots.  However, the entr&eacute;e of Phryne's father into the series gives the season a spark that is fun.  And the ending of the season is fantastic.

My #1 concern is that Essie Davis was really too old to play the part even in S1, & that's more apparent in S3. If they film S4 in 2016 she'll be 46, which will really be pushing it for a Jazz baby flapper.  I'd still like to see another season as I feel this is the best current TV series I'm aware of; though the age thing (& ABC's funding issues) may both be problematic.

In this third season, Miss Fisher begins to mellow into a full on cozy detective and the tone is a little more serious and the plots a little more complex. The core cast is just fantastic and I certainly hope this series will take flight and a place alongside Poirot and Miss Marple in the classics of cozy mystery. Nathan Page plays detective Jack Robinson who, on his own, is the chief police detective for the district. However, his most endearing quality is how he entertains Miss Fisher's efforts and together they solve the mysteries. This series is funny (Jack and Hugh Collins in the police car late at night watching the legs of Miss Fisher disappear through an upstairs window,) and engrossing.

Her father is a drunken hedonist with no sense of honor or responsibility, who obstructs justice even when  people die.  He is constantly causing death and destruction for those around him.  The series focuses on his antics, which are supposed to be funny.  The ending is poorly plotted, but then, so is the rest of the series. In the ending,  Miss Fisher flies off to England to get her father back to England. She makes no provision for her faithful servants or even Dot.  She simply flies away from Inspector Robinson and the wonderful life she has built for herself in Australia.  Typically of this third series, we don't know if she returns or not.  The taut writing, social awareness and fine characterization we found in series 1 and 2 are gone, replaced with predictable plots and the nasty father.

7342383,5,B011T0C73W,"Terrific Australian series featuring the delightful Essie Davis (unrecognizable from her starring role in ""The Babadook"") and a cast of first-rate supports.  Set in the 1920s, ""Miss Fisher"" boasts stunning production values....e.g. fabulous 20's costumes, bubbly music of the period (both newly composed and classic) and the entire cast!!
There are three blu-ray releases now, one for each season we've enjoyed so far.  All are superb technically with gorgeous 1080 resolution and excellent 2.0 DTS-MA sound!
""Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries"" is a 55-minute-an-episodreal treat all around.
The three volumes are my Christmas present to myself!!!  LOL",1449014400,,649,5.739583333333333

7342385,5,B011T0C73W,"Phryne Fisher, one of the first women's libbers, is also a very persistent sleuth. The whodunits are well written and so far (I also have series 1 and 2) I haven't found any that are really predictable as to the outcome. Her relationship with the police force, especially one inspector in particular, is rather complicated but lots of fun. When it comes to lady private detectives, Miss Fisher is my favorite. She's anything but soft and gentle, yet exudes a femininity that is at the same time forceful and compromising, sexy and brave, caring and understanding. In my opinion (and that of my husband), Essie Davis plays Phryne to perfection and makes her the kind of woman women want to be like. The supporting cast is wonderful and you get to know them even if this is your first set of the series. If you like intelligent mysteries, Miss Fisher never disappoints.",1449014400,,867,4.7105263157894735

7342412,4,B011T0C73W,"Series three is almost as good as the first two seasons. The two biggest problems, which is why I'm not giving it five stars, are that: 1) in the first two episodes Jack acts almost childishly jealous and 2) the opening credits were stretched and the music added to fill the time wasn't a good match to them. This last point isn't as minor as it might at first seem. The opening credits and music go a long way toward establishing the tone of the series. The original music perfectly matched the fun and excitement of the show. The new musical additions feel muddled, like they don't know where they want to go and in so doing weakens the confidence viewers have in the following episode. The musical is also no longer as well synchronized to the action in the credits so that high action points are now accompanied with slower moving passages. Whereas the original credits and score built up interest in the episode, the new credits and score turned me off toward it.",1447977600,,968,4.537142857142857
7342413,2,B011T0C73W,"I would have rated Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, series 1 and 2, four stars or even five stars in the category of light mystery entertainment.  The series is bright, witty, sweet, and very stylish.  Miss Fisher is dynamic, Dot is angelic, both radiate intelligence, their love interests are aw-shucks adorable. I consider it to be high quality entertainment, like Poirot, and like that venerable series, supremely well done.
  You should know that episide one begins with a graphic beheading.  That's not a spoiler, it happens in the first minute or two.
  I prefer Miss Fisher and Poirot to the disturbing and graphic network fare of Murder and Autopsy.  With Miss Fisher I didn't expect to see the bloody stump of the neck, the collapsed face on the floor, the pearls in a pool of blood.  Here I was with my cup of tea, ready for a relaxing interlude, and I was so very unpleasantly surprised.

7342414,4,B011T0C73W,"We have only so far watched the first episode of Series 3, but as others have mentioned there seems to be a different feeling to this series. I think the pace has picked up, there is less character development, and Miss Fisher seems to have lost some of her warmth and empathy towards the other characters. Jack, has a less macho and detached personality, and seems to have lost his aloofness to Miss Fisher's charms, and their relationship seems to be cooling down. Her father appears also in this episode, and to me he doesn't seem to be quite the 'evil' father figure but more of just a nuisance in Miss Fisher's life. I also think they could have omitted the beheading scene at the beginning of the episode. So, we will watch the rest of the series, but already feel disappointed... too bad as I loved it the way it was.",1447891200,,824,4.427631578947368

An incredible cast of regular characters are the perfect foil for Miss Fisher, and season 3 is every bit as good as seasons 1 and 2.  Now, if only there were 12 episodes instead of merely eight (but then I'd still be waiting impatiently for season 4).",1446076800,,411,4.76056338028169
7342448,2,B011T0C73W,"I absolutely LOVED season 1.  It was a breath of fresh air, obviously shot on a budget, but all the better for it.  Essie Davis was marvelous as the dashing leading lady, and the supporting cast, whilst not perfect, were all very human characters and totally believable in their roles.  Season two was a welcome widening of the world Miss Fisher frequents, with journeys further afield and variations on previous plots and storylines that kept things fresh.  I was totally hooked, and it was due, in no small way to the sass and swagger (among other things) of the eponymous heroine.

It was with no small amount of excitement that I started watching season 3, but even from the second or third episode, something felt wrong - almost as if the show was trying too hard to maintain the momentum it had gathered up to that point.  The writing has suffered - there have been too many corny cliches, and overly predictable murders, and whilst I welcomed the attempt to challenge gender stereotyping shown from the very beginning (in most shows it's the leading man that dallies with whichever episodic fluff takes his fancy, but Miss Fisher also embraced that role with gusto), it now appears that our unflappable flapper will dally with anyone in pants, even those with whom she has no obvious chemistry (I'm looking at you Murder & Mozzarella).  As for the acting, even Essie Davis has looked a little contrived and by-the-numbers at times.  Half of the charm of the first season was the resistance shown by the dashing Inspector Robinson to Miss F's not inconsiderable charms.  Now, he just trots around after her like a good little errand boy and calls her in to consult at the drop of a hat (or should that be camisole?).  And our very prim and proper Dorothy Williams is now apt to pilfer, lie and wield a firearm without blinking.  It all just doesn't quite gel the way the previous two seasons did.

I really hope things take an upturn before the end of the season, as I still have a couple of episodes I hope to enjoy.  But this is akin to the post-facelift nightmare that occasionally jolts you as it stares out at you from a magazine, displaying a permasmile and cheekbones so sharp they could draw blood.  Not a pretty sight, and enough to make you wonder what they hated so much that it would make them so desperate to change?  Of course a show needs to make seasonal changes to keep things fresh, but this feels like that easy-going friend you've never seen on the sauce before, who is suddenly brooding, arrogant and prone to violence.  Quite unsettling and something you try not to dwell on as it's all to easy to be disappointed in them.

Two stars may seem a little harsh, but this show was SO good, and I can't go with ""It's okay"" which is what three stars is supposed to mean.  Now I boasted that I now how to fix it, so here goes.  Firstly, someone needs to wrestle the 'Bolly' away from those in charge and come up with some more believable storylines.  Maybe a change of scenery with a trip to Europe would work.  Can you picture Mademoiselle Fisher strolling through the Champs Elysees in gay Paris?  Sadly, Google seems to tell me that the question is more likely to be whether the show would ever merit the budget that would entail.  Maybe a crowd sourced movie project with a pan-european chase involving a nefarious arch-villain, charming heros, and the odd vintage Hispano Suiza or Bentley would do it.... pretty please?",1445904000,8,3445,4.5931372549019605

7342451,5,B011T0C73W,"MISS FISHERS MURDER MYSTERIES, Series Three. In this Australian television series, Essie Davis (THE SLAP, THE BABADOOK), stars as the title character, as she returns as Miss Phryne Fisher, a lady detective from Melbourne with a stylish  wardrobe, a sense of fun, a gold revolver and a flair for solving crimes. The entertainment, based on the novels of Kerry Greenwood, is set in the late 1920s: Australia is slowly recovering from  World War I. In what might perhaps best be described as an historic, light-hearted romantic comedy mystery series, Miss Fisher continues her unconventional antics, solving crimes with the help of her ensemble of household cohorts and the suave dedicated Detective Jack Robinson, (Nathan Page, THE SECRET LIFE OF US), with whom she shares a playful partnership.  Although she often outraces him to the crime scene. In the current costume series, which is being shown in the United States on select PBS stations in syndication, we watch as, despite Jacks efforts to keep matters on a professional level, their partnership grows  more personal. Phryne and Jacks developing relationship is matched by the on-again, off-again romance of Phrynes assistant, Dot Williams (Ashleigh Cummings, TOMORROW, WHEN THE WAR BEGAN), and Jacks constable, Hugh Collins (Hugo Johnstone-Burt, SAN ANDREAS). Also present to enjoy the fun is Phrynes Aunt Prudence (Aunt P), played by the highly-esteemed  veteran of stage and screen, award-winning actress Miriam Margolyes, who has achieved success on both sides of the Atlantic. (She won the 1993  BAFTA Best Supporting Actress award  for THE AGE OF INNOCENCE(1993);also won Best Supporting Actress at the 1989 LA Critics Circle Awards for her role in LITTLE DORRIT (1987).

But Miss Fishers  estranged father, Lord Henry George Fisher, Henry, Baron of Richmond, arrives  unannounced after selling up the family estate in England. As Phrynes father does his best to ingratiate himself with her household: Dot, Bert, Cec and Mr. Butler, his roguish charm is lost on his own daughter. Phryne recalls a secret encounter that she witnessed during the War, between her father and the cousin from whom the Fishers inherited their title; she begins to suspect that her ancestor is still alive and could be out to exact his revenge.  Also, Phryne's Aunt Prudence takes on more than she bargained for when she opens her home to psychiatrist and natural healer, Hayden Samuels. And when Phryne hosts a tennis tournament to raise money for female tennis players, the practice partner of a rising tennis star is fatally bitten by a funnel-web spider, sparking a murder investigation that reveals one of Phryne's hidden fears.

In 1920s Melbourne, Phryne (apparently pronounced Frinee) Fisher is a rather liberated, modern woman operating  in a male-dominated world. (It is also a world in which aborigines and ethnics are apparently invisibleor caricatured.) And just to get it off my chest, as the daughter of a baron, Phryne should be addressed as the Honourable Miss Fisher, or Lady Phryne, but apparently they don't do that in Australia, and whos counting.  At any rate, the Melbourne scenery is splendid in high-definition, the historic costumeswhich are outstanding, flappers galore,  interiors and modes of transport appear to be accurate for the period. The acting is uniformly fine. The plots are sharply written, smart and fresh; the dialog is witty as this female cross between the Saint and James Bond goes about her business. The episodes are:
1. Death Defying Feats. Dot, Cec and Bert are having a night out, see the magic show The Mighty MacKenzie and the Cavalcade of Mysteries. First, the guillotine trick: the machine is tested on a cabbage head first, works fine.  Then it decapitates Miss Pearl, the magicians assistant and fiance.
2. Murder and the Maiden.  Night time; outside the chain link fence surrounding the RAAF Victorian Command HQ, a desperate woman runs, crying for help. A figure catches up with her; gloved hands strangle her as we watch, horrified.
3. Murder and the Mozzarella. A tenor sings La Donna e Mobile in the background; an elderly woman is attacked in an Italian restaurant kitchen.  Nonna Luisa, iron-fisted matriarch of the restaurant family, expires.
4. Blood & Money. Paddy, a street kid, hires Phryne to find his missing brother Ned.  We discover two more members of their gang murdered; see that Phryne is really troubled by the loss of young lives.
5 .Death & Hysteria.  Phyrnes Aunt Prudence feels indebted to Dr. Samuels, a psychiatrist who had helped her son, Arthur, before he died, and is also now trying to help her deal with her grief after the death. Samuels loses his office space; grateful Aunt P lets him temporarily set up his sanatorium for wealthy women, and their problems, in her mansion. The women have all been diagnosed with hysteria, a Freudian diagnosis  meaning they were sexually unsatisfied. This is an interesting episode, addressing the problems with womens sexuality that the medical establishment had trouble recognizing, much less attempting to ameliorate: an early medical vibrator is important to the plot.
6 .Death at the Grand. On the rooftop of a hotel that has seen better days, a man begs for his life; his knife-wielding stalker snarls, Wheres the money? Failing to get the answer he wants, the assailant pushes the pleading man off the roof. Inspector Robinson calls Phryne to the crime scene. Not to consult with. But because the dead man was holding a satchel labeled: Property of Miss Phryne Fisher. Phyrnes father is involved.
7. Game, Set & Murder.  Stanley Burrows, one of Phyrnes oldest friends, has married Constance, a tennis pro. Phyrne sponsors a fund-raising tournament; top players have arrived in Melbourne to participate. Theyre at Aunt Ps place, practicing on her tennis court. Theres a terrible accident. Player Bell Rosewell, Constances frequent partner, is bitten by a spider, one known to bite repeatedly to make it more dangerous, that lives only in moist dark vegetation, that  isn't native to Melbourne. Thats stuck in her shoe.
8. Death Do Us Part. The backstory of Henry George Fisher, Baron of Richmond, is finally revealed. At a cost, including the death of Mr. Quentin Tode, recent winner of the Wren Institute of Science annual prize, found dead in his observatory, his eyes and hands glowing bright blue.

The box series consists of a three disc set; eight episodes running approximately 448 minutes. Bonuses include: behind the scenes footage (35 mins.); character clips (7 mins.); Mr. Butlers Drink of the Week, (8 mins.).  And a behind-the-scenes photo gallery. Be aware, there is some violence, nudity and sexual situations, though they are not heavy.  Thank goodness, there are subtitles, for those of us not too familiar with Australian lingo.  I received this as a review copy.  Davis, whom we will soon see in next seasons GAME OF THRONES, makes a swashbuckling leading lady, who does always find her manor woman.  Shes entertaining as can be.  So is the series.",1445299200,,7038,5.100087032201914
7342452,5,B011T0C73W,"Okay, if you have come to this review, you have  I hope  already watched the first two series/seasons of this wonderful Australian Broadcasting Company mystery series.  (If not, please do go back and start with series one!)

Once I finish a MFM series, I count the days until the next one is released by RLJ/Acorn.  I think I can honestly say that this is the best of three series though none got less than five stars from me. While there is a new crime to be solved in eacg episode, its the backstory of Phryne and household plus the relationship with Jack that keeps us coming back. No spoilers I promise but things are moving forward for all. And  by know you know that Dot is engaged and the wedding is soon coming.

The series as a consistency with the Producer and Executive Producer who chooses the directors and script writers. (more on that in a minute) and the lead off story  which involves a magician and vaudeville show may be the most entertaining episode yet. There is an elaborate production number in the style of Busby Berkeley and we even get to see Phryne perform (I won't tell you more about that).

There seems to be even more sexual innuendos in this third year too. Again, I won't reveal the details but in that first episode (the magic show one) Ill bet youll do a double-take (and probably hit the pause button) when Phryne is backstage. A few of the other stories have some double entendres come out of her mouth too. And, Im not sure, but I think I hear the first expletive in the series in episode 7 or eight.

As far as graphic violence, we don't see a lot of this but in one episode there is a character who was physically hurt in the ward and wears a half-face mask.(similar to a character in Boardwalk Empire. At one point the mask will be removed and I feel I should alert the squeamish that the image is quite graphic. (I WONT consider that last comment a spoiler, but it is something that those who are sensitive to violence should know about.

There are 8 episodes on the DVD but #7 and #8 are each part of a two- parter and are best watched together. Each of the eight runs about 57 minutes.

The bonus features this time are both excellent and  in three cases  unnecessary. The latter are three 2-minute clips with the character Mr. Butler showing how to make a classic cocktail.  Theres a section called Character clips) 7 minutes where a major character comments on a moment in the series. The best is the series of interviews with the production crew (one Director, the costume designer, the makeup designer and (my favorite) the composer of the music, and others. These run about 35 minutes. Finally there is a slide show of photos (to music) which lasts just over 90 seconds.

I have purposely not discussed the plot summaries of each case (they show them on the screen before each episode but I skip past them). After all, this is a mystery so why spoil the fun?

So now that Ive finished this series Ill have wait with everyone else  for Series 4. I can hardly wait to see where the series goes next.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7342453,4,B011T0C73W,"Phrynie's father takes a great deal of wind out of the effervescent character that Essie plays.  Most of his scenes were true downers.  I don't know if it's the actor or the script.  But her father's character brings down the best of Miss Fisher.  I find that extremely disappointing.  I actually ached with a visceral response when the father entered the scenes.  It is out of character for Miss Fisher to have secrets from her by any character, except for a brief period of time.  It should not predominate the story.  Phryne is the one with the secrets, and we support her in her secrets because we know we can trust her.  Not so with the father.  Very unwise.  Jack and all the other character had more than enough to keep them busy than to reduce Phyrne to a sniviling little girl.  Please don't take her power away.  That's what makes her unique.

That being said, Miss Fisher is still one of the very best detective mysteries ever portrayed on the screen.  Please don't take Phyrne's power away: That's what sets her apart from every other mystery.",1444694400,2,1055,4.566844919786096

7342455,4,B011T0C73W,"I adore this series. Have bought all the books it's from and the 3 dvds. Essie Davis is perfect. But I'm sad to say Phyrne, not Essie has lost her spark. The writers fault. Where has the feisty, sexy, pearl handled revolver waving heroine gone? She seems to have lost her verve. The writers need to read the.books. and get back to Kerry's vision before it becomes a soap opera. That said, the acting, costumes, sets and atmosphere are superb!",1444262400,43,442,4.5375
7342456,5,B011T0C73W,"As MARVELOUS as ever. Fewer eps but also a lower $RP. More action. 1929 sets -locations- costumes -props, all the Bees Knees. Worth 6-stars.
Phryne (pronounced Fry-nee) spiffily played by Essie Davis ('Girl with a Pearl Earring' & new release 'The Slap') is a PI, assisting local cops with her golden pistol, Bond-like, and a celestial action heroine--naughty. Cops are DI Jack (Nathan Page) and Constable Hugh (Hugo Johnstone-Burt -`Cloudstreet'). Other every episode cast are Dot (Ashleigh Cummings), butler Mr. Butler (Richard Bligh), Bert (Travis McMahon) & Cec (Anthony Sharpe), and the morgues Dr Mac (Tammy Macintosh) misses only 1 ep. All Aussie, as is the production, more flair than Outback stereotype, with abundant sub-plots, suspense, & humor.

SDH SUBTITLES for all eps and film bonus
1===Death Defying Feats ===a magic assistant guillotined on stage, murder in the act. Phryne Fisher dad (Pip Miller, also in eps 6 & 8) from England conflicts her romance with DI Jack. Phryne joins the mermaid act, Houdinis trick.
2===Murder and the Maiden ===Royal Australian Air Force base has a body and missing airman. Phrynes former flyer flame (Roger Corser) is the base Captain & a new barrio twixt Jack & Phryne Fisher. Dot and Hugh have their own friction.
3===Murder and Mozzarella ===Italian restaurant kitchen grandmother covered in red sauce but no blood. Organized crime or just rival family meatball spat?
4===Blood and Money ===street urchin Paddy asks Phryne to find his brother Ned, gone missing. Other dead boys suggest an even darker element. Hugh continues torn by romance & his-&-her careers.
5===Death and Hysteria ===Is a sanatorium electrocution an accident? And in Aunt Prus (Miriam Margolyes) home, too. Watch for a good role by Arianwen Parkes-Lockwood (A Place to Call Home another Aussie must own series).
6===Death at the Grand ===hotel concierge stabbed & pushed from roof holding Phrynes purse. Again her dad, Baron Henry Fisher is on the scene, inopportunely, blimey! Substitute Const Martin (Henry Hammersla) makes a play for Dot.
7===Game, Set and Murder ===How can a spider bite death become a murder at Phrynes femme tennis tournament? Alls fair in love & tennis, including 1929 porn. Huges back, promoted, engagement blessed, score 3-love. Great acting by Jeremy Lindsay Taylor and Ella Scott Lynch, both of Serangoon Road, a miniseries not-to-miss.
8===Death Do Us Part ===Murderers at the Royal Observatory, hospital, and chasing the Fisher family. Not to mention multiple marriage issues of multiple couples. Most threads wrapped up, but a tease proves season 4 to come.
===BONUS=== each disc has Mr Butlers Drink of the Week, one for each ep. Behind the Scenes has 9 featurettes; 7 Character film clips; and many photos stills.",1443744000,56,2769,5.222471910112359
7342457,5,B011T0C73W,"Three story threads last the whole length of series 3. First is the rocky road of Dottie Williams and Constable Hugh Collins to the marriage altar. Secondly, Phyrne has an unexpected and unwelcome visit from Henry, Baron of Richmond, who also happens to be her father. Phyrnes distrust of everything he says and does is almost physical.

Thirdly, there is the matter of Detective Jack Robinson and Miss Phryne Fisher. Will they or won't they?

Once again, I loved a Miss Fishers Mysteries series. Essie Davis, as Phyrne, is phenomenal. But its not just the characters and acting. This series has good plotting, both mystery-wise and character-wise. And, like the previous two series, there is a lot of comedy. Such as when we find out that Phyrne is deathly afraid of spiders. Jack: Well, Ive finally found your Achilles heel, Miss Fisher. A fear of arachnids.
Phyrne, unconvincingly: Im not afraid! I just like to know where they are.

Miss Fisher Series 3 originally aired in May/June 2015. The 8 episodes total about 440 minutes of very enjoyable mystery viewing. If you get the DVD or BluRay release, the show is presented in 16:9 widescreen and stereo sound. English subtitles are available on the episodes and on the DVD/BluRay Bonus Extras.

The Bonus Features add to my enjoyment of the show, particularly the cute new Drink of the Weeks. Ive given information about the extras after the episode synopses.

Episode 1 Death Defying Feats Dot, Cec and Bert are having a night out, to see the magic show The Mighty MacKenzie and the Cavalcade of Mysteries. First, the guillotine trick. The machine is tested on cabbage head first  and is most effective. Then Miss Pearl, the magicians assistant (and fiance), willingly lays her head down. And it is also most effectively chopped off. That was definitely not in the program. And Phryne figures out that the blade trick was sabotaged.
Phryne to the Inspector: So, would you like to take another look at the body with me?
Jack: Is that an invitation?
Phryne: Well, I could wait all day for yours.

Episode 2 Murder and the Maiden Outside the chain link fence surrounding the RAAF Victorian Command HQ, a desperate woman runs, crying for help. But its no use. With the night hiding them, a figure catches up with her and gloved hands strangle her in front of our eyes.
Phyrne is already near, as the Group Captain has asked for her help in locating a missing airman.  Will the two cases be related?

Episode 3 Murder and the Mozzarella While a tenor sings La Donna e Mobile in the background, an elderly woman is attacked in her Italian restaurant kitchen. She puts up a heck of a fight, and we just cant get a good look at her assailant.  But, in the end, Nonna Luisa, iron-fisted matriarch, breathes her last.
Her son-in-law is sure that the killer is from the family of a rival restaurant. People have been killed for less.
Trivia: The Comorra was and is a very real crime syndicate centered in the region surrounding Naples, Italy.

Episode 4 Blood & Money Paddy, a homeless youngster, wants to hire Phryne to find his missing brother. Phryne asks him if hes gone to the police. Paddy scoffs, Not on your life! Cant trust the rozzers. Oh, I can pay you. And he pulls a hankie from his pocket, wrapped around a single silver candlestick. More where that came from, he assures Phyrne!

Episode 5 Death & Hysteria Phyrnes Aunt Prudence feels indebted to Dr. Samuels. The psychiatrist helped her son, Arthur, before he died. And Samuels is also trying to help Aunt P deal with her own grief after the loss. In the meanwhile, Samuels lost his office space, and the grateful Aunt P lets him set up his womens sanitorium, temporarily, in her mansion. Dot asks Phyrne, All those women are mad?
Phryne: No, they're far too wealthy for that. Theyre just unwell.
Unwell or not, one of the women is electrocuted in her room? For what?
This is an interesting episode, addressing the problems the medical establishment had recognizing, much less dealing with, womens sexuality. It wasn't a matter of benign neglect. Doctors like Samuels really were ostracized and punished for even trying.

Episode 6 Death at the Grand On a hotel rooftop, a man begs for his life as his knife-wielding stalker snarls, Wheres the money? He doesnt get the answer he wants and pushes the pleading man off the roof.  Inspector Robinson calls Phryne to the crime scene. Not to consult with her. But because the dead man was holding a satchel labeled: Property of Miss Phryne Fisher. Supposing it wasn't Phyrne involved, but her father?

Episode 7 Game, Set & Murder Stanley Burrows, one of Phyrnes oldest friends, has married Constance, a tennis pro.  Phyrne is sponsoring a fund-raising tournament, and top players have arrived in Melbourne to participate. Theyre at Aunt Ps place, practicing on her tennis court, when theres a horrible accident. Player Bell Rosewell is bitten by a spider trapped in her shoe in the sports rotunda. A spider known to bite repeatedly to make it more dangerous. A spider that only lives in moist dark vegetation. And a spider which isn't natural to Melbourne.  Some accident.

Episode 8 Death Do Us Part The mystery of Henry George Fisher, Baron of Richmond, is finally revealed. But at a terrible cost. Including the death of Mr. Quentin Tode, recent winner of the Wren Institute of Science annual prize. Dead in his observatory, his eyes and hands glowing bright blue.

Series 3 Bonus Extras:
A..Mr. Butlers Drink of the Week (total 15 minutes)  One of these (about) 2-minute featurettes aired each week with each of the episodes. Mr. Butler, Miss Fishers appropriately named butler, describes why each drink is appropriate for its episode. Then he gives the recipe for that drink. In the 1st Drink of the Week, Mr. Butler says, The most important aspects of mixing a good cocktail are deciding which one to serve and when.
The drinks are the Old Fashioned, Sidecar, Champagne Punch, Sherry Cobbler, Martini, Fallen Angel, Maidens Prayer and Negroni.

Regarding the Martini, Mr. Butler says, If she needs it stirred  an affectation, I assure you  always have a bottle of gin on ice to provide the requisite chill.

B..Behind the Scenes Featurettes (36 minutes total) Commentators include Fiona Eagger (executive producer), Tony Tilse (director ep 1 & 2), Robert Perkins (production designer), Greg J. Walker (composer), Anna Karpinski (makeup and hair designer), Miriam Margolyes (plays Aunt Prudence), Essie Davis (plays Phryne), Roger Lansen (director photography), Marion Boyce (costume designer), Dana Reid (director ep 7 & 8), Ashleigh Cummings (plays Dot), Kerry Greenwood (author Miss Fisher mysteries) and Deb Cox (producer and head writer).
Tilse comments on Phryne: Shes a 1920s James Bond.

C..Character Clips (7 minutes total) These are little promo clips where characters in Miss Fishers Mysteries speak directly to the camera, encouraging interest in whats coming next, and don't miss it!

D..Behind the Scenes Photo Gallery (2 minutes)

I thoroughly enjoy the Miss Fisher mysteries. Series 2 is still perhaps my favorite - I think the ""Christmas in July"" episode is one of the best TV mystery episodes ever.  But Phyrne has a lot of great mystery viewing no matter which series:

This season seems like she has lost her spark. The ""mysteries"" seem short on mystery and been there saw that already... the stories just seem duller. Still a good show and I hope for many more seasons...but hopefully Miss Fisher will find het spark and the writers will come up with some more interesting mysteries.
