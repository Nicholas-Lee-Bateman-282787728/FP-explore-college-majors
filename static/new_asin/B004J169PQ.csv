4389991,5,B004J169PQ,"In this inspiring documentary, the viewer follows the people of Budrus (A village in the West Bank) from the timeless beauty of their olive groves into the line of Israeli fire, as tension builds and culminates in dramatic conflict between a steadily growing group of unarmed protesters, and the bulldozing Israeli Defense Force.
Although it would be justifiable to tell this story solely from a Palestinian vantage point, the filmmakers lend even more credibility to the voice of Ayed Morrar, the film's Palestinian protagonist, by respectfully and thoroughly presenting Israeli points of view throughout the film. Soldiers, captains, newscasters and politicians weigh in from the other side of the ""wall-in-progress"", while back in Budrus - a heroine emerges. Morrar's 15 year old daughter Iltezam is caught on camera jumping into a bulldozer's newly dug pit, to prevent the uprooting of yet another olive tree, as her voice-over describes what was going through her head: ""what can one person do?"" This heartbreaking, but ultimately uplifting documentary answers that impossible question, by demonstrating the power of peaceful resistance - even in the face of seemingly never ending aggression.",1304899200,11,1198,5.446236559139785
4389992,4,B004J169PQ,"I think this is a pretty powerful film.  While I don't share the previous reviewer's anti-Israel comments, I do think this film is well worth seeing.  This film tells the story of a nonviolent (well mostly) protest against the LOCATION of the Israeli security wall.

These Palestinians aren't against ""the wall"" itself.  In fact, they say they fully understand Israel's need for protection.  They just don't want the wall running through their graveyard and farms.  They don't understand why the wall is going to cut them off from other Palestinian villages.  They feel that Israel could easily move the wall closer to the Green Line (the 1967 border).  Unfortunately, the Israelis don't agree.  In the end, the Palestinians do get what they want.  The Israelis, in what appears to be an obvious effort to save face, say that the nonviolent protests had nothing to do with relocating the wall.

I'm all in favor of nonviolent protests for worthy causes.  One note here however -- If these Palestinians in the film are all in favor of nonviolence, why are they flying the flag of Hamas?",1304035200,3,1085,4.836956521739131
4389993,5,B004J169PQ,"The outstanding documentary film ""Budrus"" illustrates the power of non-violent Palestinian resistance to the illegal Israeli occupation and the often brutal security policies of the Israeli army.  The Israeli government decided to put a security fence/wall right through a Palestinian olive grove, thereby depriving Palestinian farmers of the right to harvest and earn a living. The locals are organized and decide to non-violently confront the Israeli army in its illegal land grab; the Palestinians are joined by a small group of Israeli protesters and other international observers.  Parallels are made between the plight of the Palestinians under Israeli occupation and the treatment of blacks in apartheid South Africa.  Due to the persistence and iron will of the Palestinian protesters, the Israeli government eventually relents and decides to construct their ""essential"" wall away from Budrus and the olive groves.  Could non-violent Palestinian resistance lead to freedom and independence for Palestine as did the anti-Apartheid movement did in South Africa?  Small victories could well lead to larger victories if more Palestinians engaged in this type of non-violent resistance to Israeli apartheid policies.
  This remarkable film is a testament to the courage, conviction and dedication of ordinary Palestinians and their supporters in opposing the illegal land grab by Israel of Palestinian territory in the West Bank.  Israel has occupied Palestinian land illegally for more than 43 years in blatant violation of UN Security Council Resolution 242, passed unanimously by all UN Council members including the U.S.  Israel's policies also violate the 4th Geneva Convention and other international safeguards for civilians in occupied territory. It's a shame that more Americans don't see this type of film on the typical TV newscasts.  This film is highly recommended for those earnestly seeking a deeper understanding of what is really happening in Israel and the occupied Territories.",1295568000,14,1999,5.633333333333334
8431490,5,B004J169PQ,"Yet another clear-eyed, intelligent and affecting documentary on the heartbreaking, seemingly endless conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians.

In this case the subject is the title town, where the Israelis  for seemingly no good reason  have decided to erect their wall of separation not along the natural green line border outside the enclave, but cutting right through the heart of this small rural town, dividing the cemetery, and forcing the digging up of farmland and ancient olive trees that provide many in the town with their only income.  Whether ignorance, political strategy or simple cruelty on the part of the Israeli government is never really explained (a slight weak spot in the film).

But the film is detailed and insightful in tracing how the townspeople  - led by soft-spoken community organizer Ayed Morrar - stand up to the mighty Israeli border army in a non-violent way, eventually earning supporters from around the world including younger liberal Israelis, who come and join in the protests, so the conflict evolves from Arab against Jew into human beings against the army and cold, indifferent bureaucracy.  Perhaps in that re-alignment lies the seeds of a human solution for the larger conflict that the people of both sides can not only accept, but even embrace.",1482105600,,1299,5.1571428571428575

8431497,5,B004J169PQ,"This is the true story of how the People of the Book adopt the tools of 1930s Imperial Europe to persecute a people who have been at home for 4000 years. To be fair, it briefly (too briefly) shows that those who oppose these land grabs and colonialism are a growing minority of Israelis who believe that the cri de coeur, ""Never Again"", applies not only to Jews but to all oppressed and persecuted people.  Its strength is that it is a documentary, not merely fact but truth. As a Jew, I applaud its courage to hold a mirror to the Middle East and implies our complicity, standing by one side with no regard for the International Human Rights of the other. Bravo.",1330992000,7,663,4.390243902439025
8431498,5,B004J169PQ,"The passions on each side of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict are shown in spectacular fasion in this documentary.  The Israelis plan to build a border wall and/or fence separating the country from the East Bank, meaning that the Palestinian village of Budrus will lose many acres of land.  On that land are planted olive trees, a major source of income for the villagers.  Shown mainly from the Palestinian perspective, it is apparent that the people of Budrus do not oppose the wall; they merely want it to be built not on their land but on Israeli land.  Nonviolent protests take place in the hopes of stopping the bulldozers but rock throwing by the Palestinians and shooting by Israeli forces shows how emotions can become inflamed.  This is a fascinating look at how people CAN make a difference in their community.  Highly recommended.",1327795200,2,842,4.9361702127659575
8431499,5,B004J169PQ,"Budrus is exceptional!!! I feel that this film showed both sides, the Israeli soldiers and the Palestinians. This film taught me that it's governments and political factions that create the Israel/Palestine conflict, not the people themselves. Israelis and Palestinians know that they are each other's brothers and sisters. It is the governments and political/religious factions on both sides that create violence and hate. The real people who live in these places just want to live their lives and have the same basic rights to live as anyone else. This film stands above other films I have seen on this subject. It seems to shed light by calling on humanity's consciousness to do what is right in their hearts. I found Budrus to be an accurate portrayal of a nonviolent resistance movement.

I was really impressed how the different factions had to come together to make anything really happen. It was inspiring to see Palestinian, Israeli and international activists all together in nonviolent resistance. It was inspiring to see the women of the village struggling for humanity and human rights right along side the men. I liked how they use public relations and nonviolent resistance to preserve the village boundaries and their way of life.

Budrus is in my mind very pertinent to the events we are witnessing all over the middle east and abroad. I recommend this doc to anyone who wants a ""how to"" guide for making peace and solidarity between people with different beliefs and backgrounds.",1304899200,15,1497,5.032258064516129
