7876765,4,6304726880,"The Blue Eyes met the maestro - Quincy Jones for a recording of lifetime! Frank was at his best and Quincy invited all the ""bad cats"" to come along, allowing Sinatra to pay a tribute in Mack The Knife, for this gang, where he requested to Quincy to keep repeating the last phrases of that song for Frank to improvised. This masterpiece I saw once in a VHS, but never on DVD...If someone finds it, please let me know.

7876766,1,6304726880,"It pains me to write bad review about a Sinatra product, but remember, this isn't a review about the man or the singer, just the series of tapes that, in my opinion were very poorly produced. I watched 6 out of the set and gave up. The tapes run between 45 and 50 minutes and much of that time is filled with still photographs of Frank and some of his frieinds. It was almost like the producers ran out of material to fill 10 tapes. The most frustrating aspect for me was that the narration rarely coincided with the video. There were a few interesting clips from old TV shows that  featured Bing Crosby, Peggy Lee, Judy Garland and Dean Martin and some other clips of his visits abroad but, for the most part, I found it very disappointing. In addition, each tape has the same 10 second intro by Princess Grace and just ends by going to black. There are some good Sinatra video biographies out here, but this isn't one of them.",1044144000,5,928,4.333333333333333
