496152,5,6302717639,Great to see the stars of the late fifties early sixties in an entertaining melodrama. Lana Turner and George Hamilton are particularly good.,1358553600,,141,5.173913043478261
496153,3,6302717639,"I had never seen this movie before, and only ordered it because the opening credits feature scenes from downtown Fitchburg, Mass, which is my home town.  I honestly thought I'd just watch the opening credits, but I kept watching and got hooked.  It's a really good movie with some interesting plot turns and drama.  Now on to the down side: This is a bare-bones DVD, and it's essentially a burned DVD-R (blue bottom data surface, like store bought DVD-R's).  It not a bootleg or anything.  It is officially produced and marketed, but some of these older and rarer movies are purchased so infrequently that the studios can't afford to mass produce them or put any effort into them, so they just burn them and print them one at a time, as the orders come in.  That's what this is. So there are no extras at all .. just the movie itself.  And the disc may not last as long as a normal movie DVD.  And the cover is very simple too.  Still, it was worth it for me.  I'm still happy with it, because I got to see my home town in a movie, and enjoyed the movie at the same time!",1357516800,,1071,4.257425742574258
496154,2,6302717639,"I had to see Lana Turner with Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. or the other way around. It was a curiosity - superstar with very moderate actor. No doubt, Zimbalist has the GQ looks and a wonderful speaking voice, but very limited acting range.. He was at the peak of the popularity of ""77 Sunset Strip"" at this time. In that, he mainly had to be cool with a certain superior air. There were some lively characters about him to offset. Then, in the middle of his FBI series (sober, taciturn type there), he co-starred in ""Wait Until Dark"" with Audrey Hepburn. Same as here - just basically filled the suit. Saw he did some stage work early on and worked steadily through the decades, while others with his level of talent faded away. He was fortunate in his TV projects.

But this is a typical melodrama, popular during this era, especially with Turner. Everyone was at some stage of pathetic. That would except the Thomas Mitchell character, who was a breath of fresh air. They could have called this ""All Fall Down and Can't Get Up.""  It really needed to go through several rinse cycles to clear out all the suds. The visuals were the stars:  stately homes, well appointed rooms, rich paneling, beautiful fall trees. One reviewer trying to make the best of it commented that at least these drab folks had colorful backdrops.

There have been other films with the same deficits as this one that have managed to come across. Sometimes the higher caliber actors can pull it out, and there were some of those here. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.  Someone must have called for flat line, and they all adhered. The simultaneous reconciliations at the end were so low on the meter, they hardly registered. This one lacked a pulse from beginning to dead end.",1351123200,,1742,4.642857142857143
496155,5,6302717639,"I love Lana Turner movies. Her characters are so pathetic, and tragic.. but the pathos and sensitivity she demonstrated in her performances will always be remembered.. not to mention, her true story in the headlines.. what a life.. she was a production in many ways... I have most of her movies ..this is another soap story..albeit not one that the critics liked but it was one that was based on a best seller, could have developed Marjorie's alcoholism  a little better but that was the 60's  ... the story takes place in New England a cast of dysfunctional people trying to get their needs met... (that is the social worker in me)... but what I purchased the movie for to be honest... was for the music score by Elmer Bernstein amidst the New England scenes was the theme from the movie..... E.B. has always been one of my favorite movie composers.. and he does not disappoint...the sound production  was not the best, the story was not the strongest, could have been longer in the character department ,corny acting at times.. but the cast was good none the less....scenery beautiful, and the music score romantic to the core.. Another movie starring Joanne woodward and Paul Newman, "" From the Terrace"" the score by you guessed it... Elmer Bernstein once again romantic to the core...great romantic movie music always enhances the story. The  acting was good as well...another 60's product.... these are classics that this younger generation has  no concept or appreciation of these classics... they have something to learn!",1340841600,2,1528,4.906976744186046
496156,5,6302717639,"Sex, love, alcohol, rich folks behaving badly what more could you want in a movie.  Lana Turner at her best.",1301443200,,108,4.4
496157,4,6302717639,"Filmed in 1961, ""By Love Possessed"" was a scandelous movie for people's morales but tame today. This movie is about a small community of new England lawyers and families who are involved with cheating, lying, and adultry. While the exciting ones play, the boring ones are in their elements of a June and Ward Beaver home. Lana Turner has star billing but this movie is more like a soap opera and shifts between different scenes with different characters. Future Miss Ellie of the t.v. show Dallas, Barbara Bel Geddes plays the same role as the wife of Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as she did as Miss Ellie on Dallas and surprisingly doesn't look much different. A very young George Hamilton plays the son of Zimbalist and Geddes and gets into a very bad legal charge, which can damaged his chances of becoming a lawyer. Susan Kohner, who was Lana Turner's agent's daughter, plays the niece of Bel Geddess and hopes to be the financee of George Hamilton. Susan looks very much like a young Natalie Wood but her acting is predictable and limited. Kohner had a much better part in ""Imitation of Life"" as the mixed white daughter of a black maid. Yvonne Craig ""Batgirl"" makes a very conviencing whore, who gets George Hamilton into trouble. Jason Robbards Jr, a fine actor, has a limited role as Lana Turner's impotent crippled husband. However, the one you can't wait to always see is the beautiful Lana Turner. At age 40, Lana looks better than she ever has. Lana furs and costumes were no short of luxury and she knew how to act. Movie had some unresolved endings but I buy this alone because of Lana Turner. A must for your Lana Turner collection.",1300492800,2,1638,4.632302405498282
496158,2,6302717639,I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It strayed so far from the book.  This movie insulted the author.  What was the screenwriter thinking?,1178928000,2,141,4.791666666666667
496159,5,6302717639,"When you think of old Hollywood, the first person that comes to mind is Lana Turner.  She's really old enough to be my mother but she was a very beautiful women and a very powerful actress.  I have all her films.  Granted in todays age she comes off a bit campy but these were great movies. What also impressed me about this movie was the music.  Back then orchestras were used unlike the canned background music of todays films which usually leave me empty.  The music of these older films had great theme music for each character.  This is a great movie to watch anytime.  Check out her other classics like ""Madamme X"" and ""Imatation of Life"" especially if you like a great tear jerker. She was the queen of them thats for sure.",1053820800,16,730,4.402985074626866
496160,3,6302717639,"Perhaps this movie borders on soap opera (being mainly about personal relationships, something mainly sorely lacking in modern day films with emphasis on action/special effects).  BUT
an insight is gained into the lives of old New England money vis a vis their work (in this case, the practice of law), their marriages and their relationship with their children.  They live exactly as they are supposed to, as they were raised to live.  And yet despite problems do manage to find meaning and love.
Add sterling performances by Ephraim Zimbalist Jr., character actors Carroll O'Connor and (if I'm not mistaken) Thomas Mitchell, and even a very young George Hamilton and Susan Koener (excuse if her last name is misspelled), and an extra special performance by Jason Robards, Jr. (his scenes with Lana Turner especially reveal the differences between a New York trained actor and a Hollywood trained actor), which makes the film worth viewing no matter what.
Lana Turner is startlingly beautiful.  Her acting is in and out.  Still, she belongs in the film with her strange vulnerability, like silk flowing in the wind.",1003795200,16,1116,5.076502732240437
496281,2,6302717639,A disappointment.,1423267200,,17,8.0
496282,2,6302717639,"If you're expecting a first rate sweeping soap with Lana Turner changing outfits in every scene you'll be sorely disappointed with this pathetically limp affair. If they'd stuck to the plot of the novel, and invested a great deal more money in the production and the screenplay we might have had another Peyton Place. But what we get instead is a film that looks like daytime television, with cheap, terrible sets, and awful lighting, a decidedly plump, aging Lana Turner, looking her worst, and a cast of really good actors, totally wasted. Elmer Bernstein tries desperately to whip up some excitement with an almost hysterical score that has nothing to do with what we're watching, and Lana Turner wears a hairstyle you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. It's not even fun, sadly.",1421539200,,782,4.887218045112782
496283,5,6302717639,"Wonderful story, great DVD. Great vehicle for Lana Turner--beautiful gowns.",1420848000,,75,6.6
496284,4,6302717639,"George Hamilton was perhaps not the best choice for his role, but everyone else is stellar in this timeless film about love and basic values. Well worth watching!!!!",1420588800,,165,4.928571428571429

496287,5,6302717639,"Lana Turner is at her best here with lines like, ""You made me feel like an animal long before I knew I was one!!""

The acting is not at all bad here, Susan Khoner is wonderful as is T. Mitchell and Bel Geddes. (She is Hamilton's mother!!)
George Hamilton is better than he was in other films, and E. Zimbalist is himself..not too good, but you can brush him aside.

Jason Robards turns in a mean performance as Lana's husband, and Everett Sloane as the doctor of the town has stirring scenes.

See it for Lana and for a better rendition of the crazy novel which is incomprehensible.

Also too, another beautiful score by the great Elmer Bernstein!!!",1382227200,,649,4.47457627118644
496288,3,6302717639,"A small town attorney (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) must deal with several important issues during approximately a 3 day period: his wife (Barbara Bel Geddes) who is unhappy in their marriage, his son (George Hamilton) who is arrested for raping the town tramp (Yvonne Craig), the failing mental faculties of his law partner (Thomas Mitchell) and engaging in an affair with his other law partner's (Jason Robards) wife (Lana Turner). A huge best seller and critically acclaimed upon its publication in 1957, no one reads BY LOVE POSSESSED today nor does (I stand to be corrected) James Gould Cozzens' reputation (he made the cover of Time magazine) enjoy the literary position he had in the 50s and 60s. You'd never know from the film that it was based on anything other than a trashy potboiler. To be fair, the film mutilates the book. Turner's adulterous wife, for example, is a minor character in the book but given prominence in the film. Hamilton's character, who is deceased in the book, is resurrected and combined with another character whose sister is rewritten as his girlfriend (Susan Kohner, in the film's best performance). What's lefty is a lush imitation of a melodrama that cries out for Douglas Sirk (Sirk's regular cinematographer, Russell Metty, is the film's DP) to come in and rescue it. Instead, it's directed by John Sturges whose best films (THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THE GREAT ESCAPE, BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK) are testosterone fueled ""guy"" films that give no indication that he has a talent for glossy melodramas. Elmer Bernstein provides the ripe underscore. With Everett Sloane, Carroll O'Connor and Jean Willes.

The Bounty DVD from Australia is a nice wide screen (about 1.78) non anamorphic transfer.",1368748800,3,1717,5.024561403508772
496289,1,6302717639,"I'm a big fan of old movies and am very accepting of stories that, by today's standards, seem a bit silly. By Love Possessed is beyond silly. It's pure idiocy. A waste of some good acting talent.",1364083200,,195,4.297297297297297
496290,5,6302717639,By Love Posessed was a great soap in 1961 and holds up well now as good entertainment. Lana Turner was one of the most glamorous stars ever. Probably meant most for Lana Turner fans as she struggles with alcohol and adultery in mink.,1363996800,2,233,4.441860465116279
7829639,5,6302717639,"This film was the first offering on inflight entertainment on passenger jets in 1961. It's a milestone just for that. But I enjoy soap operas and I have always loved Lana Turner. After seeing her in both Peyton Place (the 1957 film) and Imitation of Life, this film is a bit down in quality but still highly entertaining. And this is one of Susan Kohner's few films, Lana's beautiful co-star in Imitation of Life. She decided to retire at the peak of her career and concentrate on raising her children. All in all, a very satisfactory film.",1525737600,,540,4.577319587628866
7829640,4,6302717639,"Saw this on Roku. As the critics say, definitely a little soapy by modern standards. But good cast and generally good performances. I had a weakness for this one because I'm an attorney. The film really does capture the feel of life in a small law firm in a small town. And the small circle of local big shots that run everything. In my opinion, improves on the James Gould Cozzens novel from which it is loosely based.",1511222400,,419,4.384615384615385

7829644,1,6302717639,Did not care for this movie. Weak storyline. Acting was o.k considering what they had to work with. Jason Robards acting is the only one who stood out in this one.,1468540800,,163,4.290322580645161
