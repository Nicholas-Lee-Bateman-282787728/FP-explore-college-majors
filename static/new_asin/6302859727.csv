523264,4,6302859727,"This movie so touched my heart, the abuse that this young man took so as not to rock any boats, especially for his mother.  I lived thru such experiences with my mother and brother, my brother was always taking abuse  by such selfish and inhuman men or stepfathers.  I am purchasing this movie  to share with my brother.  The acting by everyone, Dinero, and Leonardo  were captivating.  I sobbed for an hour, it was so real.",922233600,,424,4.5
523265,5,6302859727,This was my faviorte DiCaprio movie. I am not a big fan of his but he was great in This Boys Life. DeNiro who plays Dwight absolutely makes this movie. Although it is a serious movie you really cant help but laugh at  Dwights character. This movie def. deserves five out of five stars. This is  one of my friend Jay and my faviorte movies. Also Amazon.com ships it quick  so you can have it EXTRA fast! Theydo a great job.,920764800,2,422,4.185185185185185
523266,5,6302859727,"Being a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio for 4 years, of course I had to see this  film, Leo's first REAL movie (let's just forget about Critters 3, shall  we?!).  I saw the film over 2 years ago, and it still gets me every time.  Leo launches into the role like a pro, opposite heavyweights DeNiro and  Barkin.  The story is so compelling, so remarkable...still brings tears to  my eyes each time!  Why didn't more people see this film???!!!  END",903830400,4,439,4.455696202531645

523316,5,6302859727,"The kind of film from a story/memoir that restores trust in the human spirit  not only surviving but overcoming. The main character, Tobias Wolfe, had every reason to grow up and be a loser: divorced parents, mom picked abusive men, no close relationship w/father, moved around, blocked from developing interests. His hope sprang from motivation for better, more, perseverance, and determination. Leonardo DeCaprio's performance is breath taking. Is there a greater power or inspiration than truth?",1465516800,,498,5.552631578947368

523324,5,6302859727,"Leo finally got his Oscar this year, but he started collecting points with this, one of his first films.

Released in April 1993, a month after ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" This Boy's Life portrays a very young Leonardo DiCaprio as the young Tobias Wolff living with a sadistic stepfather (played by Robert DiNiro) in the backwash of Washington in the late 1950s.

I think it was DiCaprio's first lead, and I must say he did a great job portraying ""Jack"". The story is loosely based on a true story of a writer who's teen years were a little rough because his mother (Ellen Barkin) never could get the right guy. She meets and marries Dwight (De Niro) a drunk mechanic who lives in the middle of nowhere Concrete, WA. Dwight seems to resent Jack, always chastising him, and picking on him. There's fights, and Jack makes some wild friends. His one really good friend is a "" homo"" named Arthur Gayle. Many, many funny parts including Boy Scouts, Jack hogging chocolate cherries, and Dwight's saxophone playing.",1456617600,,803,4.395973154362416

My dad was a bully also, who delighted in making his kid's life a living hell. The scene in the car could be ripped-out of my life(you a Hot-Shot? Hot-Shot). This film relives, and opens a lot of scars. It is amazing, that a film could do this...at the time(and years after) I felt I was the only one that could have a father like Dwight!

Excellent performances by both Robert de Niro and Leonardo De Caprio. This is a sad story of the limited choices to women in the 50's. It pained  me to see what the mother endures and how the son has to suffer through the abuses by this step father. More tragic is that this is a true story, and that this boy really had to deal with this man. A story that has probably repeated in tens of thousands of homes, it is a glimpse into the pain and struggle for power within this boy's life. An excellent film.",1416441600,,553,4.064220183486238

This was a heartwrenching story--Di Nero is so good at making you HATE him...I just can't shake it! I wanted to jump through the screen and beat him up. Ellen Barkin is beautiful and Leo's acting gifts shine even at this early stage.  We loved this movie in a painful way.,1407369600,,434,4.538461538461538

523444,4,6302859727,"As most people agree, some with faith and others secularly, there is a way out of our troubles, trials, and even tragedies. Yet it's so hard to find that way out much of the time; don't you agree?

All of this having just been said, This Boy's Life is a beautiful reminder that there really is a way out of the troubles, trials, and tragedies of this world, a personal testimony of someone who knew all three--and came out better than he was before (Note: Tobias Wolff's memoir of the same name reveals more hope young ""Toby"" found after the hardest stage of his life was over, some--not all, but some--of which is omitted from the film.) For some of us, this story speaks personal volumes, and reminds us of the hope we have not yet found and still clinging to, or the hope which delivered us long ago.

And even if you have no personal connection to the story of This Boy's Life, there's a fun hitch involved: we see Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro ""get in the ring"" together! It's extraordinarily special today, compared to when it first happened, because now ""Leo"" and ""Bobby"" share the same honor with Harvey Keitel: they are the three most frequent moles of Martin Scorsese! Scorsese said last year that he plans on reuniting the two golden actors (""It's my dream and I'm going to make it happen,"" to quote the man himself), and many of the same principles to Scorsese films--anger, tragedy, triumph, and hope--are ***all*** to be found in the very original DiCaprio-De Niro collaboration: which, by the way, was DiCaprio's very first starring role!

It is in this role where DiCaprio portrays one of literature's most beloved college professors and storytellers: the previously mentioned Tobias ""Toby"" Wolff, who, at a very young age, became estranged from his father and older brother Geoffrey (note: the film fictionally depicts Geoffrey's name as Gregory). With his mother Caroline (portrayed by Ellen Barkin), young Toby got to travel across the country, receive a beloved Winchester rifle from his mother's stalkerish boyfriend Roy (portrayed by Chris Cooper), and become a  ""juvenile delinquent"" who cut school and vandalized its property, among many other outrageous, degenerative acts. Sadly, Caroline was left to deal with this degeneracy herself, her young son being without a fatherly example and trying ""to drive me into an early grave,"" as Caroline/Barkin say(s) in one scene of the film (note: I cannot remember her exact words, but they were either exactly that or 99.99% close to the previously mentioned sentence.)

This all changed--yes, in real life and the film alike--when Caroline met Dwight (De Niro). Dwight was a single father to two daughters and one son yet, despite that, knew how to charm the pants off any young woman (as far as the film is concerned--Tobias Wolff's memoir reveals a far different Dwight!)! When Dwight first met/meets Toby, he shows such a great interest in the young man that he invites him to participate in a ""turkey shoot""--and offers to be the father Toby doesn't have, to show Toby the fatherly correction and love that he so desperately needs.

In the end, the only thing that turns--and turned--out to be sincere was Dwight wanting to show Toby correction: correction in the forms of passive aggression and even, many times (more in the book than in the film), physical abuse. Worst of all, there was no one to lift Toby up out from the pits: Caroline, seeking desperately to avoid single motherhood again, submits herself to Dwight and lets him have his way, even when it is not in the best interests of her son (note: read the book and you will see that this was not always the case). Blend all this together, and you have just as much suspense as you have drama!

Compared to the memoir version of This Boy's Life, much of the film adaptation is fictionalized: but not entirely. Some of the depth from the memoir is missing--like why Toby moved in with Dwight when he was so miserable with the idea--and details such as, was Toby telling a partial or full lie when he said he didn't impersonate Dwight (we see him do it for only one scene, which fails to give us our answer, though the real Toby reveals it in his memoir.)? Having mentioned that, however, This Boy's Life has far more strengths than weaknesses, and that comes into play with the impersonation scene: it's a RIOT to watch Leonardo DiCaprio impersonate Robert De Niro! It is truly a shame that neither DiCaprio nor De Niro received Academy Award or Golden Globe nominations for their performances: This Boy's Life shows them at their very, very best, bringing to life the hope that Tobias Wolff's memoir reveals. Yes, there are great clouds of doubt that De Niro brings into this hope--after all, he plays the real-life antagonist--but his role is still pivotal in that it proves, once again, that evil can be very easily turned flat on its head--and used for redemption.

523462,4,6302859727,"If I had just one reason to tell you to rent this, it would be to watch this for the sheer joy of seeing Leonardo DiCaprio in his younger years, showing off his acting chops.

That being said, it is also fascinating to watch this because Deniro plays one hell of a miserable warped bastard with a bad temper.  It seems his goal in life is to  make everyone as miserable as he is.

 His character enjoys being a macho man, even if deep down inside, he is a hardly a man at all.

 While he enjoys making others miserable, his main focus is DiCaprio's character.

This is based on a memoir and after viewing the movie I could not believe the author lived through this kind of life.
The movie is a tribute to the resilience of the human spirit.

The fact that it is a period piece( the movie starts in the 50's) is also a pleasure to watch, along with the songs of the era being played in the film's soundtrack.

After the movie I had to go online and read up on the author of this  memoir.

You may find yourself just as interested to see what becomes of a boy that loves his  mother so dearly, that he always agrees to go along with her wishes just to make her happy.

 Wishes that he often knows are going to end up being nothing but heartache- for both of them.

The mother is played by Ellen Barkin, who fits very well into the role of a lovely and attractive single Mom of the 50's.

One who has resigned herself to another bad decision she has made.

 She can do far better than Deniro- but she feels stuck and since the truth is that  she *is* stuck, so is Dicaprio.

This is the first movie I have seen of DiCaprio as a youngster, before he hit the 'Titanic' wave of fame.

Deniro has played bad guys over the course of his movie career but nothing quite like this.

I would consider it a character study between DiCaprio and Deniro because their characters are complete opposites and yet they are a constant presence to one another, which makes what Dicaprio has to endure unavoidable.

This is a  true human interest story - a film that shows Dicaprio had great acting ability in him, even at a young age. It has Deniro & Barkin together and a superb glance back into the 1950's era.

These are just a few good reasons to consider viewing this movie.",1366329600,5,2257,4.227166276346604

In both these films the focus and strength of the movie is not in story or plot so much as the characters and relationships.

I just watched Taxi Driver and was amazed at a young Jodi Foster's ability to match the charisma and acting excellence of De Niro and captivate your attention in scenes with him. I could see This Boy's Life having been a much different film if it were cast (years earlier) with Matt Damon or even if Tobey Maguire, who has a bit part in this movie, had swapped roles with DiCaprio. DiCaprio (as Toby, the boy in the movie) just did not have the acting depth to propel an otherwise very good film into movie greatness. De Niro dominates in this film, and the scenes he was in were by far the most gripping. It was unclear through most of the film whether his strictness was driven by a motivation for Toby to fufill his potential or whether Dwight was just using the boy as a scapegoat for his own feelings of inadequecy and powerlessness.

But each of those movies are about a million times better. I did like the part when the boy with the scarf beat the hell out of Leonardo DiCaprio. Besides being personally offensive, it's just such an unimaginative way to make a film. Because I'm not really learning about any of these people. Instead the director and producers chose the easy way out by sensationalizing the story. That's so pathetic. I suppose if there was an important message or if it was a historical reference it may be different, but like I first said this movie really served no purpose and is just rather bland and boring. But this is just my own opinion so don't get your panities all bunched up if it doesn't jive with your own. Lately people on this forum get so incredibly hostile when anyone dares to give their real and honest comments. What's up with that?

Based on a true story, this film produces some of the finest acting one would ever want to see. Tobias is everything that his stepfather DeNiro never was: good  looking, intelligent, talented, one who enjoys reading. DeNiro positively hates him and steals the show with a display reminiscent of Lee J.Cobb in ""On The Waterfront"" 40 years before. Bitter, violent, sadistic, jealous, one would be hard pressed to match this acting performance,  however loathsome to the viewer. Ellen Barkin, Tobias' mother, really does love her son, but her forte has always been in the bedroom, certainly not in gray matter. Only in the end does she step forward, breaking up a deadly fight and fleeing with her son-she heads for Washingtonn D.C., Tobias to Prep School. Often overlooked, DiCaprio's late pubescence allowed him the liberty of a man playing child or adolescent roles; he was in the range of 18 years old playing this magnificent role, an age similar in ""Gilbert Grape"".In any event, this is a film worth multiple viewings, even though the main subject matter is totally reprehensible.",1200528000,,1189,4.969849246231155

Tobey Wolff's Award winning true life memoir is so gripping that even Hollywood could not have thought up something this fantastical. This is Leonardo Di Caprio's movie. As riveting as the likes of Chris Cooper and Robert DeNiro are as Ellen Barkin's ""bad choices"" in life, this film never strays from DiCaprio's amazing spot-on portrayal of a boy who is forced to survive the only way an abandoned child can.

That he can play diverse roles with such conviction is amazing.  Saint or sinner, he is always believable. The film captures the late 50's era and the precarious situation of a savvy, wily and very witty teen boy and his divorced & striving working mom realistically...and their journey to what the mother thinks will be a better life.  There are both frightening and hilarious incidents...also, much courage and bravery.  Ellen Barkin and Leonardo DeCaprio are excellent...so true and believable in their roles.  I was rooting for them all the way.  The movie led me to read the book, which then led me to read another book by the author's older brother, who went to live with the father rather than the mother and his harrowing experiences.  This film should be seen by all troubled teens..I also see it as a warning to women with children who find themselves with an abusive partner.  My only criticism is the implication that anyone who stays in a small town like Concrete and works in a factory or with their hands is a loser (not everyone can become a writer/teacher)...the important thing is that one can eventually escape and free oneself from a bad homelife or situation and not let it or other set backs ruin one's future or whole life.",1171238400,5,1416,4.700404858299595

I have since realized that DeCaprio, who should have gotten an Oscar nod here, very much resembles my youngest son; hence I have trouble watching him in peril.  So don't be put off by my reaction unless you have such a child too.  As the last line in the description barely mentions, this is from the true life story of the novelist, Tobias Wolff, which does give it an immediate authenticity.  Ellen Barken and DeNiro were also good, as you would expect, but it is the young DeCaprio whom you can't take your eyes off of.  He walks away with every scene he is in, no mean feat with Robert DeNiro.",1140134400,4,747,4.232394366197183

As a college professor he is an outspoken Liberal.  My theory, aside from his mother's interest in Democratic politics: the unfortunate stepfather and the new Dad's insane disciplinary mindlessness warped Wolff's perception of Red State citizens and their Conservatism.  Ah, the making's of a Liberal.

I enjoyed the film and marvel as everyone else at the childhood acting skills of Leonardo DiCaprio.  He is the smart 1950's boy gone crazy at the chafe of a hateful father.  His mother has exhausted all possibilities, agreeing to marry the manly, ex-Navy guy with a house, some relatively mild children, and a business.  It should have worked out, but De Niro plays the obsessive-compulsive small burg narcissist to a menacing crescendo.

I don't live far from The Hill School, which is located in Pottstown, PA, and frankly, driving past the walled campus, I have never seen one preppy rich kid walking the streets of an old steel town.  No wonder the real Tobias got expelled; it's a small world behind those gates.

523518,5,6302859727,"... as Leonardo DiCaprio was pretty much playing out my life story as a child with a meek mother and an abusive, self-centred, alcoholic stepfather. Unlike DiCaprio's character, however, I didn't go through a rebellious stage - I remained a clean-cut, boy-next-door type who steered clear of trouble just so that my brutish stepfather with the extensive gun collection wouldn't totally go off the rails. The combination of his mental instability (he'd already had one major nervous breakdown by the time I was 10) and firearms in the house made me a stressed-out, nervous wreck with a sleeping disorder from having to keep one eye open at all times.

Bob was just like Dwight - a total hypocrite in that he appeared to be a perfectly calm gentleman among adults, but was in fact a childish bully who unrelentingly terrorized us at home on a daily basis.

As an outdoorsman, he liked to play the role of the big shot executive with his obnoxious, blue-collar fishing/hunting buddies by providing all the booze, steaks and other goodies while his family had to do without at home. When we did have food in the house, he insisted that supper not be served to anyone until he arrived, which was often not until 9-10pm because he had to spend a few hours at the local strip joint after work before coming home. Then we'd have to endure his furious booze-fueled tirades over the most mundane issues, the supper table being his favorite place to pick fights. Not being his biological child, and the only other male figure in the household, I was his whipping boy and somehow always to blame for everything that was wrong with his life. Needless to say, it made for an extremely high-stress household for my mother, my younger sister and especially myself. Although I don't harbor any grudges, I no longer have anything to do with him. It's the only way for me to try and put nearly 20 years of misery behind me.

If the above scenario sounds familiar to you, I totally understand where you're coming from. This DVD, along with BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA, would make a good double feature to be given out as Father's Day gifts to toxic stepfathers everywhere.",1125014400,9,2148,4.6923076923076925
523519,4,6302859727,"'This Boy's Life' is, said one critic is, ""The best coming-of-age movie since 'Stand By Me' (another great movie), and he is right. The film clearly tells the story of a boy growing up in the '60's with his single mother, and they're just trying to get by. Life is hard for them, obviously. So Toby ""Jack"" (performed brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio) promises himself he'll do good in school, ""make straight-arrow friends"", and ""keep his nose clean"". Then comes Dewight.

  As soon as Dewight joins the family, Toby begins to rebel. He makes friends that he has a habit of smoking, cursing, and talking bad with. His grades slip and he is constantly getting in trouble. He hates his life and can't seem to settle down.

  If this sounds like just another drama about some kid to you, well, it's not. You just have to watch the picture to see. The dvd isn't in the greatest shape (the picture is a little fuzzy and the only extras are the trailer and a brief filmography for some of the people involved in the movie) so I would suggest catching it on tv sometime. Overall, I would give it four stars. A must-see movie!",1123718400,,1117,4.5049504950495045

523521,4,6302859727,"I just happened to catch this film on HBO one evening and was stunned at how good it turned out to be.  While I appreciate some of the remarks of earlier reviewers, I don't believe that films and books should be evaluated against the same criteria, so I am more forgiving of the bedroom scene in the film.  For me, the bedroom scene between Dwight and Toby's mother serves a purpose -- to show just how much of a crude, repressed guy Dwight really is, not to mention calculating, since his bedroom behavior is about 180 degrees away from the uber-gentleman he purported to be when he was courting the mother.

In any case, the main interest of the film for me lies in the role of Toby as played by DiCaprio.  I was never much impressed with him in Titantic and his other hits.  He was adequate, but in my view much overrated.  Here, however, his talent is much clearer to me, especially in the way he convinces me to believe that Toby is actually a good person, despite his behavior.

But the main strength of the film is Tobias Wolff's story line.  For much of the film, there is an inexorable feeling of Toby marching to his ultimate doom, not unlike one of those novels of the Victorians like Thomas Hardy.  There is a sense that, no matter what he ever does, Toby is destined to become a desperate adult, trapped in Concrete and probably slowly drinking himself to death after his shift is over at the local factory.  The fact that Toby gets himself out of Concrete and away from his step-father, not to mention also saves his mother, is deeply hopeful.  Even though the notes at the end of the film say that he was eventually expelled from the Hill School, it's clear that he went on to make something quite impressive of himself, and that he did so in spite of all of the nasty stuff that went on during his formative years.

This makes me want to recommend the film to all teens, especially boys, who feel helpless and trapped right now, as well as to the adults who care for them.  Wolff's story says that no matter how difficult our circumstances, and no matter how many blunders our caregivers make, each individual still has the opportunity to shape his/her life.  We are not destined for anything that we don't want for ourselves, provided we are willing to push back and fight for ourselves.

Finally, as a foster parent I found this film hopeful because it shows me that well-meaning adults like Toby's mother (and me!) may make mistakes, but that a child's failure is not completely determined by our decisions.  And that's a degree of comfort for those of us who are trying hard and worry about whether we're doing the right thing.",1098748800,83,2647,4.483333333333333

Perhaps my understanding would be somewhat different, but my vision is that reducing it to a simple family violence story does not reveal the real drama. The movie is a desperate attempt to get out of this town, this social environment, it's a challenge to predestination. The whole town itself, Tobbias friends, abusive father in law are nothing more than decorations, cover images. They simply personify and represent what would have happened to Tobbias and his life had he decided to stay.

This highly dramatic movie contains many shocking scenes that may become eye openers to some.  Such intensity keeps the audience closely watching every second.

Every actor assists with the audience impacts with their wonderful performances.  No one holds back a drop of emotion from their characters.  Robert De Niro wonderfully plays a child abuser.  Though few will like the character, he'll be remembered by many.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Barkin brilliantly play the victims.  This is more noticable in DiCaprio because the cruelty hits him the hardest.  His closely-breaking-down parts are performed realisticly.
""This Boy's Life"" is the movie for those who are looking for a power drama.  Its impact will never be forgotten by anyone.  Anyone who watches this movie will be entertained.",1068249600,5,1117,5.207865168539326
523524,5,6302859727,"I have always liked Leonardo DiCaprio. I think that his portrayal in the television show 'Growing Pains' was very heartfelt and brought a lot of depth to the show. Since the time that he first started there, I began to fall more and more deeply in love with his acting ability and his talent. There are, however, few of his movies until recently (Gangs of New York) that I could say I really enjoyed. This was one of those few. I tend to carry a copy of this movie around with me now in the hopes that I'll find a video player, that is how intense my feelings are for this particular movie. I have also read Tobias Wolff's autobiography on which this movie was based, and I have got to say that the movie outshines even the book! A rare thing indeed!
Never have I seen better acting than that which is performed by DiCaprio and De Niro in this particular movie. They are a stunning team, work brilliantly together, and truly bring the effect of the relationship between Jack (Tobias) and his step-father home to the audience. If this movie doesn't make you cry, nothing will! The film industry needs to put out more movies like this more regularly. Nothing can compare to a great movie with a lot of heart that shows, ultimately *reality*. ""This Boy's Life"" does just that where many, many others have failed.

Two other boys look upon the gay boy as being weak just because he was gay.  They convince Dwight (Leonardo) to pick a fight with this boy.  The gay boy wins the fight and he and Leonardo become friends due to a mutual interest in playing the piano.  Dwight, going to a new school at high school age, which is always a difficult adjustment, is desperately in need of friends.  This was very moving to me.

The movie follows the story of the young boy Toby ""Jack"" Wolff (Leonardo DiCaprio), a rebel boy who seems to dislike every school and every town that he is in. His mother Caroline (Ellen Barkin), an attractive single woman, keeps searching for a decent man that would take care of her and her son. She finally seems to know the One, when she meets Dwight Hansen (Robert De Niro), a respectful guy. But after a few months living with him, Caroline and Jack realize that Dwight is a bully with a strong need to dominate every one around him. So now things get difficult to both of them.
""This Boy's Life"" is a charming drama with strong performances by the great Robert De Niro and the attractive Ellen Barkin, but Leonardo DiCaprio steals the show from them; I actually think that he was a better actor when he was younger, he is good now, but in this movie and in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" he was brilliant.

Leonardo found his niche back in April of 1993 and has never given it up. Leonardo does intelligent drama. Hey, look at Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can.

523542,4,6302859727,"This movie is about a mother and son, played by Ellen Barkin and Leonardo DiCaprio, who move in with the mother's new husband Dwight, played by Robert DeNiro, whose true colors come out after they move in. This is a serious and often disturbing film. Dwight and Tobey(DiCaprio)do not get along. This leads to a number of confrontations that are both verbal and physical. The physical fights are extremely unnerving. You have been warned. It is beautifully acted and written. DeNiro is very electrifying and larger than life. He is down right terrifying. DiCaprio is just as good. The guy can act. Ellen Barkin is good, but she is sort of a co-star and doesn't seem as important. The final climax is one hell of a memorable scene. It's almost worth the price of rental alone. See this movie. You'll be deeply satisfied.",999820800,14,818,4.7272727272727275

523544,4,6302859727,"I found it a little wierd how well Robert De Niro fit into this role.  Very convincing!!  Of course, Leonardo DiCaprio made the movie what it is.  This kid can act (if you don't believe me, see Gilbert Grape).
My suggestion would be to read the book first.  Then watch the movie.  The book (in my opinion) is not quite as good as the movie (usually not my opinion). The director takes a little liberty with the film, which really adds to it.
Good film.",976665600,,452,4.270588235294118
523545,3,6302859727,"As a De Niro fan, I guess I should never say this, but I'm going to say (write) it anyway: Leo di Caprio steals the picture here! Only in ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"" have I seen him giving such an  absolutely stunning performance, stealing the picture to Johnny Depp,  another great actor that I admire.
  ""This boy's life"" is  certainly not a milestone in De Niro's career. In fact this movie closed  somehow a period during which he has made a string of mediocre movies, such  as ""Guilty by Suspicion"", ""Backdraft"",  ""Capefear"", ""Mistress"" and ""Night and the  City"", and he went on later to give stunning performances in great  movies such as ""Heat"", ""Casino"" and  ""Sleepers"". Although I like De Niro and di Caprio, to me  ""This boy's life"" is just a watchable movie. The best thing this  movie brought to the audience is di Caprio who, I'm sure, will certainly  give other remarkable performances throughout his long and, I hope,  illustrious career.",963619200,2,955,4.773006134969325

I never went and rented, and still haven't to this day, but I did catch the whole thing on  cable.  I was floored by this movie.  Phenomenal performances by DeNiro,  Barkin and Dicaprio (shocking enough).  I have yet to own this movie, but  plan on it.  Very passionate, and full of life.  It trace the true life  story of Tobias Wolff, whom is now an author and teacher in New York, I  think that is where he is.  Watch, rent and buy this movie.

It shows how the boy deals with all the  violence  and hatred on a day to day basis. Overall I think this is a good  movie to watch.,939254400,,303,3.9344262295081966
