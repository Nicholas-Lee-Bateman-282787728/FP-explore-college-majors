8459900,3,B0056U3REA,"2 1/2 stars. A Science Fiction film, but its core is hardly SF.  This is a long film (130 minutes) and it does drag. But, it uses this length to create character, so it is unlike any SF films that would be made today. The time is supposedly in the future, but there is no futuristic gimmickry presented. It looks just like the world in 1980 Glascow (where it was filmed). There are only 3 ways we know it is in the ""near"" future: 1) The main character (Katherine) is a writer of cheap novels who uses a computer to create her plots (as do all writers in this world) 2) The other main character (Harvey Keitel) has a video camera implanted to replace his eyes, and which transmits sound and images to a central TV station (MTV), and 3) Death is a rare event that only happens to the very old. All disease and physical problems have essentially been conquered. It is so rare that MTV wants to film and transmit a realty TV show featuring Katherine, who has been diagnosed with a non-curable disease and who will die soon. She does not know she is being filmed.

Way ahead of its time in showing Reality TV, and definitely in-synch with our prediliction for being obsessed with others' misfortune. Good acting, but some incomprehensible actions on the part of Katherine (Why does she return to her former husband? Why did she never change her name after marrying her second husband? Why is she not relieved when she finds out that (SPOILER) her diagnosis was an error? ) So, for me, this was a confusing mess, but it did try to ask big questions about life/death/ privacy, etc. Very little action, and lots of conversation. Not a terrible film, but definitely for fans of film -- not for the masses.",1493596800,,1696,4.467741935483871
8459901,4,B0056U3REA,It was great! Way ahead of its time. This film is not for everyone. It has to do a lot with ethical matters of privacy and corporate greed but it's interesting how they depicted the future without getting lost in the environment of the future being depicted.,1457654400,,258,4.51063829787234

8459905,3,B0056U3REA,"Death Watch is one of this intellectual science fictions, the leftists like so much. They can see meanings where are no
meanings at all. The story is weird sometimes and you think you are too stupid to follow, but the script is stupid.
Schneider and Keitel are wonderful as always. Keitel, a man with a camera in his eye can record everything what he sees.
A owner of a TV station, Keitel is working for, should observe a woman, a court witness. At least, the woman should be
killed with the help of the TV station owner and Keitel. She flees...Maybe Tavernier directed this one, the critcs weren't
too bad.",1382313600,4,607,4.527272727272727
8459906,5,B0056U3REA,"When this movie was first distributed in 1981 it bombed. Presumably it was uncomfortably ahead of its time, for now - 30-plus years later - it's a topical and amazingly relevant. examination of current media intrusions and the prurient popular curiosity that drives them. The settings - Glasgow and its surrounding countryside - are unusual, and magnificently photographed, and the central performances are outstanding. What a talent the film medium lost when the beautiful Romy Schneider died only a short time after making it. Young Keitel is good and truthful too, and of course  Dean Stanton and von Seidow do their usual high quality work. There's also an intriguing very early appearance for Robbie Coltrane. The situation is dramatic, the outcome moving and satisfactory. Altogether, this is people-oriented SF and a very fine adaptation of D G Compton's distinguished 1976 novel - which incidentally has recently been reissued by Gollancz in their SF Masterworks series and is well worth a look.",1367539200,7,1003,5.229813664596273

8459908,5,B0056U3REA,"Not only has Death Watch never previously been available on DVD, but this fascinating, moving, and disturbingly prescient SF film has never been distributed in North America at its proper length - something that I'm assured by Shout! Factory will be remedied with this release. Distributors of the film apparently felt, when it was first released in 1980, that a twist that Tavernier introduces into the narrative wouldn't be accepted by the audience, and/or (according to the director) would be seen as too dark a commentary on the cynicism of television producers and their overriding lust for ratings. I won't spoil that twist by letting people know what it is, but for North American admirers of the film as it previously was released here (on VHS, Laserdisc, and on film, clocking in at 117 minutes, as opposed to the correct 128), be advised: you have never seen the film as the director intended it, unless you've bought the hard-to-find French Region 2 DVD (or caught up with it in another country - I first chanced upon the full film on VHS in Japan, where it was released un-chopped). In fairness, not all the material that was omitted from the film previously is completely essential (discussions about the virtues of ostrich leather for footwear and a cameo by Bernard Wicki were both cut without doing too much damage), but the ending of the ""director's cut,"" as this can properly be described, is far more forceful and ""political"" (in a broad sense) than any previous North American release, and will make the film seem quite new even to people who admired it previously. There are a dozen other reasons to admire this film - the cast is fantastic, especially the leads, Keitel and Schneider; it's a very important film in Harvey Keitel's career; co-screenwriter David Rayfiel is at his best; Antoine (Pierrot Le Fou) Duhamel's soundtrack is terrific (and also the source of an amusing anecdote, which you can find on IMDB); and its arguably the greatest English-speaking role of Max von Sydow's. As for its prescience - never mind its prediction of Reality TV or the idea that computers will replace live teachers - read up on Toronto filmmaker Rob Spence, who, like Roddy, is having a camera surgically implanted in the place of an eye... Haven't actually seen this DVD yet, but I'm very very excited that it's happening. Good move, Shout! Factory!",1337990400,20,2364,4.86848635235732
8459909,2,B0056U3REA,"The product description indicates that the audio for this film is in English, with Portuguese subtitles. Indeed, the DVD arrived with a sticker on the shrinkwrap reading as follows:

! AS ADVERTISED !
IMPORTED!!!
DVD Menu and Sleeve Notes in Portuguese
Audio in English
Subtitles are Optional
We welcome returns

Alas, the audio is not in English, but in French, in which I am far from fluent. There is no English audio option.

The two stars represent a compromise between the film I remembered and hoped for (and the video quality seems very decent) and the disappointment at the language barrier as delivered. I'll hang onto the disc (who knows? I may return after forty years to my study of French, or perhaps I'll learn to lipread) rather than returning it, but the seller really should be aware that the product he delivers does not match his online description in this very important particular.",1326758400,4,902,4.8441558441558445
