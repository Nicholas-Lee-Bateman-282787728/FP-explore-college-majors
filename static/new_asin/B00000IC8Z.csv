1220834,4,B00000IC8Z,"This quirky and amusing series anticipates other engaging shows -MOONLIGHTING and THE X FILES come to mind - with its saucy dialogue and double meanings, not to mention the idea of a man and a woman sharing equal roles in the plot lines.",1242172800,,237,4.534883720930233
1220835,5,B00000IC8Z,"Probably one of the best TV series of all time.  Different from anything else out there at the time, The Avengers was outrageous, fun, & campy & still is.  A lot of the technology is old now, but it is still fun to watch.  The acting of Patrick Macnee & Diana Rigg is just great.",1235433600,,279,4.036363636363636
1220836,5,B00000IC8Z,"Prior to 1967, ""The Avengers"" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement!

This DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in a box, this ""Set No. 1"" color-coded BLUE), is ONE of FOUR sets for the 1967 episodes. The marketing of ""The Avengers"" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.

1967 was Diana Rigg's last full season as Steed's partner. Her career really launched in 1965 from this fine series in her role as Mrs. Emma Peel, the sexy and lively partner to the refined secret agent Englishman, John Steed, who was shrewdly played by Patrick Macnee. In fact, in the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until many years later.

Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of the series. Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. Never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish.

Each 52-minute episode is futuristic and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in these episodes, every nemesis ranging from a time-traveling nemesis to a bird-like, comic book super-hero who knocks off ruthless businessmen.

Here, we're talking about six very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:

""From Venus with Love"" -- A group of rich individuals, all of whom are dedicated to the future habitation of Venus, are being systematically knocked off. Steed applies for membership!

""The Fear Merchants"" - What's the best way to defeat your competition? It's simple! Just find out what they're each personally scared of, (through psychological analysis), and then scare them to death! A great episode -- lots of fun.

""Escape in Time"" - A covert group is hiding away international criminals for a cut of their profits by sending them back in time! Steed investigates and, in an attempt to rescue him from danger, it's Mrs. Peel who gets sent back in time to a brutal inquisitor! A superb episode.

""The See-Through Man"" - It appears that the Russians have bought a secret weapon which will send Great Britain to its knees -- a formula to make their agents invisible! A quirky, (but unfortunately absent-minded), professor tries to make good on his mistake of being duped into selling the formula to the enemy by helping Steed and Mrs. Peel to recover it but the professor's unethical assistant sees a chance to make some extortion money, which fouls up the good guys (and gal).

""The Bird Who Knew Too Much"" -- A shrewd parrot with a great memory and an extensive vocabulary is being used by the Ruskies to transmit secret military information from out of England to behind the Iron Curtain. Steed and Mrs. Peel have to track down the elusive Macaw before it's too late!

""The Winged Avenger"" - A madman dons the garb of an ornithological super-hero to make England a better, and kinder, place to live... by killing off ruthless businessmen! Steed and Mrs. Peel are called in to quell this comic-book weirdo. A really great episode.

The storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1967 marked an even higher level of absurdity. This did not diminish my love for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention it only to prepare viewers for this actuality.

The casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Rigg's provocative, '60s mod body suits  much accentuate her sensual magnetism with the notable change from black-and-white to color.

I'll be reviewing all of the 1967 ""sets,"" (as I mentioned earlier, there are four in all, with 2 ""volumes"" per set), over the next few days so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon. In the meantime, this particular set garners my highest recommendation!",1211414400,4,4779,4.875462392108508
1220837,5,B00000IC8Z,"Born in the 1970's, I never heard of The Avengers until I watched the reruns on BBC America.  I'm really sorry I haven't seen this series earlier.

It's weird watching the black and white episodes after you're used to watching the color shows.  But color added a surreal touch to the show: Emma Peel's sometimes futuristic wardrobe comes to life and, it seems, the plots got more far out (then again, 1967 was a very far out year).

I'm glued to every episode of The Avengers and wish TV shows nowadays could be as interesting.",1104364800,,527,4.515789473684211
1220838,5,B00000IC8Z,"First set of 1967.  This saw the Avengers to go colour and more episodes.  These are some of the best Avengers, where the pairing of Mackee and Rigg well settled into their roles, with great scripts, really playful story lines.

1) ""The See-Through Man"" - ""Steed Makes a Bomb - and Emma is put to sleep"" has Emma and John fighting an enemy agent, ala invisible man, but our pair knows seeing is not always believing

2) ""The Bird Who Knew Too Much"" - ""Steed Fancies Pigeons - And Emma gets the bird"" has a villain using carrier pigeons to further his evil plans and the object isn't birdseed!

3) ""The Winged Avenger"" - ""Steed goes bird watching - and Emma does a comic strip"".  This episode one of my favs, has a comic strip avenger come to life to seek vengeance.  Jack MacGowan makes a guest role that is great fun.

4) ""From Venus With Love"" ""Steed is shot full of hole - and Emma sees Stars"" The British Venusian Society is brewing a conspiracy that Steed and Emma  must foil

5) ""The Fear Merchants"" -  ""Steed puts out a light - Emma takes a fright"" Businessmen go on a retreat to relax, instead come back to die, actually being frightened to death by their phobias.  It's up to Steed and Emma to find out who is behind this deadline plot

6) ""Escape in Time"" - ""Steed Visits a barber - and Emma has a close shave""  One of the best episodes has criminals escaping the law by going back in time.  The costumer has Emma meeting Matthew Tyson who puts Emma into stocks.

Classic episodes with the stories, acting and tongue-through-cheek antics at their best.  Directing turns done by Roy Baker, Gordon Flemying and Robert Asher.",1097452800,18,1632,4.422818791946309
1220839,5,B00000IC8Z,"If you liked the Avengers, or just enjoy dry humor and wit, then this is for you. These are the best of the Avengers series, and in color, Emma Peel never looked finer.
Very reasonably priced for the number of episodes included, though there almost no ""extras"" which would have been a welcomed addition. Money well spent.",1077926400,3,321,4.649122807017544
1220840,5,B00000IC8Z,"If you fondly remember that great British import that we watched on TV way back in the 60s then you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of the product. Like John might say to Emma, ""You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back. Just watch the hat please."" John and Emma are back and are here to stay via DVD technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. They look good, very good, excellent in fact.",996624000,2,563,4.371428571428571
1220841,5,B00000IC8Z,"Every director and film editor should learn from this series.  How such elaborate stories are tautly scripted into 50-minutes TV installments with amazing results is one of the major reasons of the Avengers' success.  One-liners are so skillfully cued to the next scenes that they deliver the  desired effect, be it humorous, suspenseful, or any other.  Combining  mystery, suspense, humor, irony, sci-fi elements, spoofs on spies and  villains, playful seduction, the series delivers the perfect, unique mix  that not only entertains but stimulates and nourishes the mind.  Mrs. Peel,  Steed and the other known and unknown guest stars, all deliver their lines  and performances with detailed perfection.  Seeing Mrs. Peel and Steed  interact with each other is a delicious experience.  They both remind us  that delicate and demured sexuality are eternally most satisfying and  stimulating. I estimate that after buying one set of the Avengers you will  end up buying them all.  On this re-mastered DVD's  format, the Avengers  seems so fresh as if filmed today.",953424000,7,1064,5.301204819277109
1220842,5,B00000IC8Z,"I grow up in the 60's and my favorites were the The Man from U.N.C.L.E, Wild Wild West, I Spy, but when The Avengers first came from England it was like Wow.  This was totally different: sexy, strange, great on screen  chemistry between Emma and Steed.  Well, I just bought this new DVD and  it's just super.  Super picture transfer and sound, and most strange the  stories don't seem dated at all (after 30 years they have held better then  I expected).",949708800,2,454,4.463414634146342
7909987,5,B00000IC8Z,I was a fan of The Avengers (the British TV show) from way back when I was a kid.  Finding this was both nostalgic and refreshing . Of course I had to get it.  It is an excellent representation of the show. I only wish more complete years were available.,1431302400,,254,4.06

7909989,5,B00000IC8Z,"I have not purchased this DVD set yet . Oddly enough the VHS boxed sets that I purchased over 15 years ago still play and look fine . The aspect ratio with most of these early TV shows is 1:33 . So as with all filmed in this format the people look 5 feet tall and 3 feet wide and the same with cars , they look 8 feet wide and 4 feet tall on a HD TV . Even when you adjust the ratio on your HD TV they still do not look correct .The best way to watch these old TV shows is on a older (picture tube) tv . For those of you who do not have the Avengers , the DVD set, this is a good deal .",1419638400,,586,3.446969696969697

7909996,4,B00000IC8Z,"I was a huge fan of the Mrs. Peel era ""Avengers"" when it aired on ABC in the 1960s.  If you liked the show at that time, you should add these volumes to your collection.  These are the first episodes after the show went from B&W to color.  The episodes I have viewed so far (""From Venus with Love"" and ""The Fear Merchants"") were well mastered and thoroughly enjoyable.

My only complaint on this DVD so-far is how the disc starts playing an episode as soon as it is loaded into the player.  Previous volumes took you to a menu to select what you wanted to see.  Here, you need to hit the menu button.

If you are not a child of the 1960s, 1950s or earlier, you might not have experienced the show in its original airing unless you viewed BBC re-runs of the color episodes about eight-10 years ago.  The show has a lot of action and wit.  Mrs. Peel was the prototype of the female super-heroine that appeared decades later in films like ""UnderWorld"" and ""Electra"" - hot looks, super intelligence, and the ability to kick most men's butts with minimal effort.
