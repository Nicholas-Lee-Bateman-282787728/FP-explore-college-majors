8239088,5,B0010XB3G6,"As an Italian, I thought I knew most of the natural beauties of the country.  After watching this video I realized how much I didn't know!",1331251200,,138,4.3076923076923075
8239089,4,B0010XB3G6,"I really enjoyed this DVD, it has wonderful video and aerial photography typical of the Visions series. I've been to Sicily, it is a beautiful island and this production does it justice. The only changes I would make: include the Greek temple of Segesta (an absolute must-see), and lose the American narrator, who sounds like Rick Steves (can't confirm, but not appealing). The voiceover on Visions Of Italy is a classy foreign woman, much more pleasant. Still, very enjoyable and highly recommended! I'm ready to return. As they say, ""Conquer Sicily, everyone else has!""",1293926400,,571,5.085106382978723
8239090,1,B0010XB3G6,"Five Stars for the Visions DVD Series, including this Visions of Sicily program.

Minus 4 Stars for selling this DVD as if it was a standalone product for 2/3 the price of the Visions of Italy 2-Disc set which includes this title.",1220486400,10,230,4.476190476190476
