8602764,3,B00E8WFUN8,"Quality of video and translations could be better. However, beggars can't be choosers and it's nice to have the series under 1 package deal.",1457740800,,140,4.875

8602767,3,B00E8WFUN8,"Ok... It has its flaws but it is great to see it in this country.  Yes its a girl power rangers show but hey, its pure cheese.  Concerning the english subtitles... Couldve been better, but we all know the story and whats going on.
You people need to relax and enjoy it",1424822400,4,268,4.134615384615385
8602768,1,B00E8WFUN8,"Please don't buy this! I bought this for my niece and little did I know, it's a total bootleg copy. It looks like someone sat in front of their tv and filmed it with a camera! The subtitles are messed up too! Please! Don't buy this!",1424217600,4,232,4.065217391304348
8602769,2,B00E8WFUN8,"I bought this for my wife recently and it's a huge let down! The quality is pretty bad and there's a timestamp on the upper part of the screen--as if this was recorded from TV. The sound quality jumps from time to time as well. Not to mention, the subtitles are sometimes wrong, or they flash on and off in less than a second. I've seen this set together on different sites for about the same price but with different covers. I recommend try to buy it through other places because this copy is nearly unwatchable.",1389571200,9,513,4.354166666666667
