4330697,5,B004CYVZ18,"Minds like parachutes work best when open and this presentation offers some ground breaking insights for those with open minds.  Nassim addresses the infinitely big in relation to the infinitely small vis a vie boundaries, fractals, and hyperspace (sacred) geometry. He presents the possibility, indeed probability, that an ancient ""Intelligence"" (superior to our own) predates our current, generally accepted history. (By this I mean the one we learned in school that starts with the Sumerians.) This ""Intelligence"" seems to have had a hand in constructing the Great Pyramids, utilizing the Ark of the Covenant, and initiating gravity defying, Biblical events that seem to be supernatural.  He draws upon mathematics, physics, archeology, history, world religions, Kabalistic philosophy, logic, and common sense to arrive at a well thought out, innovative unified field theory that I think will gain majority acceptance with time. Outstanding graphics and animations help to clarify concepts.  Nassim has a way of making complex concepts readily understandable.  He's a great communicator with a sense of humor that makes this work educational, eye opening, and enjoyable. I liked this so much, I'm going to get the Technology of God book.  As I understand it, it's a science fiction work based on concepts presented in this work.",1312588800,5,1331,5.441747572815534
4330698,5,B004CYVZ18,"The relationship between man and nature has been one of most intriguing question ever made. I believe that Haramein's research are extremelly clarifying towards this sense. The most outstanding thing about this video is the science involving physics, mathematics and geometry that unifies all existing things. I recommend this for everyone who is interested in science and life.",1310947200,3,378,5.5344827586206895
4330699,5,B004CYVZ18,"I discovered Nassim Haramein from a Facebook post off my friends list.  He has a day-long lecture divided into 45 ten-minute segments on YouTube that I spent the next 3 days watching.  The YouTube videos were of poor quality video with very difficult to view projections of graphs, charts, and videos.  It didn't matter.  What this man was saying was mind-boggling, riviting, and difficult to discount.  I immediately put this DVD, ""Black Whole,"" on my wish list and received it as a Father's Day gift a couple of days ago.

The DVD is basically a compressed presentation of his day-long lecture, but produced in a very professional format and condensed to a near-perfect 90-minute length.  All of the projected visual aids are now replaced with state-of-the-art animations and motion graphics, some of which do an amazing job of allowing the viewer to experience what many of Haramein's original visualizations in his own mind may have been like.  The way he describes the tetrahedrons coming together in various combinations is masterfully duplicated by the graphics artist in such a manner as to astound one with regard to the level of sheer brilliance required from the man's mind in order to make the seeming leaps of logic that he does beyond that of even our most respected physicists and cosmologists.  But then, what should one expect from a person who, at the age of just ten years old, was visualizing Reality from the 'infinitely small' to the 'infinitely large' on his school bus when every other kid his age was collecting baseball cards.

I watch all sorts of these 'deep' science shows on Science Channel, etc, and most are chock full of speculative theory, but lack any actual hard logic, math, or evidence to back any of it up.  Haramein has got the goods to back up his theories, and the math to PROVE it!  His equations are offered in a separate section of the DVD for anyone to review and pick apart.  What they show is there is virutally no difference between the volume of energy in the vacuum space of a proton, and the combined mass of our entire Universe!  What they show is how Reality is an Infinite Whole, dividing Itself infinitely by fractal geometry, all of it glued together through the requirement of Subjective Consciousness, the existence of which is as necessary for Creation to take place, as Creation is necessary for Consciousness to Know Itself.

A must-own for all deep thinkers!",1308614400,107,2421,4.814009661835748
4330700,5,B004CYVZ18,"Haramein's presentation is part lecture, part breathtaking event...a glimpse at the Universe unified.  Some of the math needs a second or third go-round, but the film in general is so compact in its presentation, yet so vast in what it encompasses, that it made me giddy.  Haramein begins by taking us on a brief journey, and from there expands the view of the Universe to the point where we are looking not only out among the stars, but also deep within ourselves.  We see ourselves as a tiny speck of the Universe, and as the Universe itself.  This is a must see movie.",1305936000,4,571,4.514563106796117
4330701,1,B004CYVZ18,"I don't expect this review to go down well with Haramein's little army of gullible fans, but this material is cheesy garbage, and truly awful. Don't go near it if you're at all interested in anything with any resemblance to observable reality.

You can give it all kind of names, but it's very definitely not science, and it has nothing to do with black holes or the geometry of hyperspace or any of the other claims in the misleading blurb.

Fine if you like a sparkly fabricated story and don't care to check whether there's any basis for any of it. Fine if you prefer charisma to honesty and understanding. Fine if you like your ideas handed to you from the salesman of a pre-packaged and lucrative brand and don't want to ask any deeper questions.

Before you spend any money on any of his merchandise, please be sure to look a little deeper into the way he's built an institution based on image, fluff and wilful ignorance. Do a little investigation, and judge for yourself if you think he's the ""physicist"" he claims to be and not the self-promoting new age pseud with a scientifically naive following that the rest of the world sees.

(If you're someone who couldn't give two hoots about the truth, and you prefer to be spoon-fed stories by a con-man rather than challenge your own views, then feel free to ignore the warning - I wouldn't dream of telling you what to do. Watch it again and again and ignore anyone who tries to point out why it's completely wrong if makes you happy, that's fine by me.)",1305849600,43,1510,4.5
4330702,5,B004CYVZ18,"This riveting piece of science reminds me of the passion I loved about Carl Sagan.  High level concepts distilled into their essence and made palatable to all parties.

It starts with the absolute basics, and takes the viewer on a journey into the deepest reaches of space to the smallest divisions of space.  Truly mind-opening.

This is the opening salvo of a new science that is emerging that turns modern physics on its head, and does it in a way that even non-scientists can understand after a couple viewings.

If for no other reason then to challenge your perceptions and model of the universe, this is a MUST BUY.

Thank you to Nassim and team for distilling such a huge amount of information into a DVD-length film.  You have done an excellent job.",1302566400,45,757,4.646616541353383
4330703,5,B004CYVZ18,"The presentation of this program was half way between a lecture and a scifi movie with terrific graphics. My wife and I were stunned when we watched this movie. My wife was on the edge of her seat during the entire movie. Some of the physics discussed were a little hard to understand, but we hung in there and were stunned by the final conclusion that we had no problem understanding. It was super fantastic. This man has connected every thing up with everything else...science, religion, pyramids and ancient Egypt, Von Daniken's ideas, astronomy, etc. We enjoyed this movie so much, we watched it again a couple of days later and understood almost all of it the second time through. And it was just as enjoyable and fresh as it was the first time. If you like to learn about scientific advances, you'll love this one. And we plan on watching it at least a couple of more times as we expect to understand something new every time we watch it.",1301097600,94,944,4.526315789473684

4330715,5,B004CYVZ18,"To really absorb this video I had to watch it more than once. The ideas are radical, but any breakthroughs into another level of understanding are. I had heard about Nassim Harriman from a number of associates of mine, even from a well-known quantum physicist. So, I took the time to finally see what all the commotion is about. His ideas completely put the world of physics as currently understood on its head. The video is done for lay people so the scientific language is not too complex.  There are also numerous visuals that are very well done. Overall, difficult concepts were made easier to understand.

So, it's about this guy who has no credentials, no credibility, and clearly not even a basic understanding of physics.  He knows just enough buzz words and basic math to make the more gullible among us think he knows what he's talking about, but he's really just an idiot with an ego.

4330728,5,B004CYVZ18,"This movie is about choice.  Do we go forward, or stall and fall back into the dark ages?  Ever wonder how it was that people couldn't believe the world is round?  Today we have a similar situation where we need to choose which reality is real, flat world or round, closed or open minded?  Nassim is brilliant and clearly demonstrates through sound reasoning and logic a new and more comprehensive understanding about our the nature of our world.  He expertly and cohesively picks up and completes Eisteins work on relativity.  In doing so Nassim creates the first complete theory explaining the unified field we live in and defining the mechanics by which it operates.  This movie goes beyond the quantum mechanics of our holographic world as we were shown in the movie: What the Bleep Do We Know.  Nassim is slowly being recognized by the established body of science and his theories are forming the founding principles of a new scientific understanding.
Watch the movie and realize why the question makes no sense when asking if the world is flat or round.  It is like the question asking if a tree makes a noise when it falls in the forest if there is no one there to see or here it.  Incredibly there is no world and there is no forest for a tree to fall in!  The world, the forest, the tree and everything else we experience are not real physical matter; they are perceptions.

Knowledge is power and what Nassim Haramein shows us in this video is the most powerful knowledge because it created and is our world.",1427673600,4,1518,4.5814814814814815

He explains something which others try to make complicated with clarity that anyone can understand and keeps it enjoyable throughout the entire video.  I would enjoy this topic even if it was boring but Nassim and his subtle humor makes it fun and exciting.  I feel he has finally come up with a brilliant unification theory, making quantum and relativity come together perfectly and it just makes sense to me.  He has eliminated some if not all of the silly things I think scientists have made up to cover their lack of explanation for so many years and it speaks truth to me.  Point after point it comes together and the puzzle that has eluded me and others for decades just falls into place.  I've listened to mainstream physics for decades and so much of it is so intriguing but there where always holes and unexplained gaps in the connection of the two studies of physics, relativity has been so interesting and quantum blows my mind but for some reason until now when you try to put them together you know something is missing.  I think Nassim has figured it out.  For years I have been so curious about the mysteries of ancient knowledge, How exciting that clues left for us thousands of years ago could have been pointing to the answers all this time.  So glad I found Nassim and I feel fortunate he has spent so much time putting all this together to share with us.  He is brilliant, fun and accessible.",1402358400,2,1522,4.521897810218978

4330764,5,B004CYVZ18,"My father was a research chemist. One of his maxims was that any scientist who couldn't explain his complex scientific concepts simply, without jargon, and so that anyone could understand it, didn't know what he was talking about.

Nassim Haramein DEFINITELY KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT, and so do you after watching his presentation. As another reviewer commented, it is a concise, easy to understand presentation, with some extremely helpful graphics and illustrations. And Haramein is a scientist with a real sense of humor, not just sarcasm.

I got this DVD because I have had many psychic experiences which I cannot explain. As I like to say, I was raised on molecules. I have been reading books, watching videos such as SENSING MURDER, and attending lectures on the subject for the last several years in an attempt to formulate for myself some new theory of how this all might be possible.

Haramein lays out clearly and with pictures another way the universe might work. He turns the old theories on their head and asks even better questions, like how do we arise out of space, which is mostly what fills everything in the universe.

Let me just finish by saying, Haramein ends by relating his ideas to many ancient symbols, including the pyramids, Kabalistic theory, and others. This DVD is a must if you are trying to grasp a theory behind the conscious universe.

To me, a child of the fifties, this is as great a shift of perception as when in grade school we had the old Mercator projection map of the world and everyone noticed how odd it was that South America was a perfect fit into the African continent, as if they were pieces of a puzzle. Of course, the idea that continents might move was nothing less than unthinkable, ridiculous and laughable in those days.

Dissolve, dissolve....continents DO MOVE. So now I never say never.",1360022400,5,1850,4.765625
4330765,4,B004CYVZ18,Just recently I have been interested in learning more about quantum physics and stumbled upon Nassim Haramein and his controversial work.  I found his theories interesting even though he had never found much praise in the scientific world.  I have always believed that those who follow a different path and don't allow negative comments of others to alter their course are the ones who end up being true pioneers.  Time will tell whether or not his work fits into that catagory.  Either way he has enlightened me to think about how the universe works in an entirely new way.,1358899200,2,574,4.767676767676767

4330774,4,B004CYVZ18,"Nassim does a fine job conveying the essential elements of his unifying Holofractal Universe theory in a concise and easy to understand format.  Those familiar with Nassim's early uTube presentations will enjoy the outstanding graphical representations in this video which help animate many of the concepts Nassim first introduced us to in his lecture at the Rogue Valley Metaphysical Library.

There are plenty of self-proclaimed advocates of the scientific method who grovel and cower in the face of science's cult of expert knowledge, who are all too ready to the scoff at the ideas of Nassim and any others who dare to inject a new line of enquiry into humanity's quest for knowledge.  While Nassim at times doesn't do himself any favours whenever he deviates too far from the core elements of his unifying theory, his detractors without fail are quick to cast out the precious gems with the stones.  This is to be expected however, as Science's history is littered with the bitter scorn of vested interests within the scientific establishment as they desperately cling to a crumbling, indefensible paradigm, and sceptical open-mindedness gives way to nagging fears of irrelevance.

In spite of the difficulties the majority of the established scientific community still have in reconciling holistic scientific viewpoints with their indoctrinations of a shallow, materialistic universe, a small number of courageous vanguards, including renowned physicist Elizabeth Rauscher, are helping Nassim to usher in the next evolutionary phase of science - an objective science that thoughtfully integrates modern discovery with ancient knowledge, leading us back to the origin of matter and the inter-connectedness of all things - the Black Whole.",1349568000,,1743,5.416974169741698

4330779,1,B004CYVZ18,"As a teenager, I loved watching the less-than-reputable TV preachers clutch their bibles, squeeze their eyes shut, and tell the viewers that God was telling them to say ""Ye must give in order to receive!"" And, they personally made millions of dollars doing it exactly like that, since so many ""believed"". It fascinated me that so many seemingly rational folks could fall for such blatant ruses.

I watched Haramein talk his ""physics"" for about a minute before the vision of those TV preachers popped back into my head from 35 years ago. I am not a professional physicist, but I love reading about cutting edge physics and have done so for many years. That said, I also have many lingering questions about the validity of the scientific paradigm itself (especially the elephant-in-the-room problem that the scientific ideal of ""objectivity"" arises itself from nothing more than a shared mental construct). The point is that I am TOTALLY open to other interpretations of ""reality"" than those offered by current paradigms.

But Haramein simply isn't ready for prime time. The local cable channel late at night, maybe. Like the TV preachers, his charisma is the only thing that keeps his evangelical message afloat. His understanding of simple scientific concepts is laughably egregious; his lack of depth and true insight immediately reveal why he has to fake his ""accomplishments"" in marketing himself; and his CONjectures sound more appropriate for a smoke-filled dorm room full of stoned first-year physics and philosophy majors. ""Wow, dude, that's HEAVY! Did you think that one up yourself?"" (Even then, I don't think most bright kids in that scenario would buy his self-aggrandizing ""theories"" that he himself understands and a thousand PHD-level physicists working at REAL physics-related jobs aren't smart enough to.)

No need to get into the details. Watch some clips of him on u tube to see for yourself. If you have a reasonably solid understanding of the scientific method in general and basic physics in particular, you'll think this guy is a hoot. What you'll learn will be about human psychology, but certainly not physics.

On the other hand, if you have little understanding of how science is REALLY done, and are easily swayed by charismatic personalities using quasi-technical jargon and complex-looking charts to instill credibility in the scientifically-untrained, then you'll think this guy is Profoundly Brilliant -- and that he's not recognized as such simply because ________ [choose one: (a)a massive conspiracy enacted by embarrassed and threatened scientists worldwide to ignore his important work, (b) all paradigm-upsetting geniuses fail to be recognized when they first appear, (c) the energy companies are suppressing his work so we won't be able to get free energy, and (d)any other unprovable reason that ""sounds good""].

He is entertaining. Yet it is a long stretch to claim this is actually rigorous and insightful analysis with any valid conclusions. There is a simple, clear reason why his ""work"" is ignored by the scientific community: beyond his illusory showmanship, he has nothing to contribute that stands up to even the crudest scrutiny.",1339804800,33,3177,5.233791748526523

I found this DVD to be extraordinary in that Nasim Haramein's explanations were easy to follow and the material was so breathtakingly original. The DVD is a lecture with lots of great computer-animated illustrations, and I felt entirely enthralled by Haramein's enthusiasm for his subject, as well as his humor.

This DVD delves deeply into the concept of the unification of quantum mechanics and Einstein's Theory of Relativity--or the unification of everything-- and according to the excellent presenter and scientist, Nassim Haramein, the 'many black hole' concept has now become a Unified Field Theory-- or--
the BlackWhole!!",1326326400,2,402,5.5
4330786,4,B004CYVZ18,"Black Whole discusses the concept of ""Vacuum Energy"" aka ""Free Energy"" -- a potential limitless source of energy anyone could tap anywhere at no cost to them and no destruction or conversion of matter into energy. Due to the way the author describes how vortex energy works, tapping it could also give the benefit of being able to influence the gravity of an object.

(Personal commentary: Hence would vacuum energy enable e.g. inter-stellar travel at speeds approaching light speed. Your car would drive forever without refueling, and the global domination of energy corporations (incl. invasions of other countries to get their oil) would cease to exist.)

The topic is presented very well. That being said, I found myself (an engineer) wanting more technical detail. E.g. the calculations of vacuum energy were done with some amount of hand-waving. It's not that they were less believable, I just wanted to be able to reproduce them myself.

There is of course some controversy on that math. John Baez of UC Riverside wrote a good article on it titled ""What's the Energy Density of the Vacuum"". And I finished the movie wondering if it showed little more than some fancy geometry. The difficulty is that, since nobody has shown how to tap into vacuum energy, it's all hypothesis. And describing hypothesis in a compelling manner is inherently difficult, as you don't have anything to show besides math and pretty pictures. Nonetheless I found myself inspired enough that I looked into flights to go to the author's ""Delegates"" course in Hawaii to learn more.

BTW, the author is also interviewed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THRIVE-Blu-ray-Disc-Region-0/dp/B0060BBZC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THRIVE Blu-ray Disc (Region 0)</a>, in which he covers some of what is in Black Whole.",1325116800,4,1833,5.443661971830986

Nassim very clearly identifies the problems with current models of the universe embedded in modern physics: blatant fudge factors. Then he demonstrates how his new concept about the density of an atom creates a perfectly linear graph of objects in the known universe. Finally he points to clues all around this world which suggest that ancient sages have known the secret of an unlimited power source coming out of the space we occupy. This is awesome!",1322870400,4,551,5.133333333333334
4330788,5,B004CYVZ18,"Nassim Haramein, transcendent 21st century physicist of the new paradigm, presents in simple terms to a lay audience the results of 20 years research.  Working alone and in collaboration with teams of physicists, electrical engineers, mathematicians and other scientists, notably Dr Elizabeth Rauscher, he completed what Einstein started but did not finish, a fully developed scientific thesis demonstrating how the universe works - the unified field theory.

Haramein keeps his audience spell-bound, as he describes his journey of personal and scientific discovery. He combines the innocence of the divine child with authority of the experiential scientist, enabling us ""to see a world in a grain of sand... and eternity in an hour"". The sophisticated visual effects, produced by animations and visual media artist Oleg V. Danilevski, are breathtaking. Buy this DVD, you won't regret it.

The message: If I understand what he is saying correctly, Haramein shows that the same laws, such as the Phi ratio and Fibunacci sequence, apply to galaxies, stars, humans, atoms and subatomic particles, and they all work the same way.  Everything from the smallest to the largest, has a black hole at its centre, which is connected to the black hole in everything else, and the black hole is filled with space.

The oscillation of waves and the spiralling motion of the vacuum are what make gravity, rather than the other way round. Galaxies do not produce holes; rather black holes are a function of the vacuum, constantly replicating the big bang as sources of particles that eventually lead to the formation of the universe.

Resolving ancient mysteries: The secret of the structure of space has been passed down through the ages via mystery schools using the symbols of the Star of David, flower of life and tree of life.  Haramein discovered that these 2-dimensional symbols represented 3-dimensional structures that together pointed to the way the vacuum operates, incorporating spin, coriolis and centrifuge effects that create gravitational pull like water going down a plug hole.  This creates the black hole from which subatomic particles of light emerge, forming matter and eventually galaxies.

Consciousness is the black hole/white hole within each of us that connects us to the space vacuum and the black hole in everything else.  It has a feedback system like a double torus that allows us to realise who we are.  If we are individual black holes, what is the implication of that? We can create matter in whatever form we want, indefinitely, using the unlimited energy of the vacuum.  The universe is a stable steady state system which can never be depleted.",1321660800,33,2664,5.169767441860465
4330789,4,B004CYVZ18,it condenses the very long series of his earlier work in to a one sitting lecture.
