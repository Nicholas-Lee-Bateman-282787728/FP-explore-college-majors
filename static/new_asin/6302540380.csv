7827679,5,6302540380,"although DVD is favored over VHS these days...for such a low price, I could not resist sending this to a fan and her L & H-lovin' Mom.

This oft-maligned short (for the cost cutting edits and backdrop of the final ""chase"" scene) is an essential because every single frame leading up to that is, yes, priceless.

They were never funnier than in this 1932 (yes, we all have our faves)...Billy Gilbert is incredible as the Doctor who recommends Hardy stay in the Hospital for at least a couple of months with his broken leg.

After Laurel concludes his ""visit""..and Ollie is...out. Please buy this.",1364256000,,595,4.701923076923077
7827680,5,6302540380,Undoubtedly County Hospital is among my favorite Laurel & Hardy movie of all time.  I was literally laughing hysterically from the beginning to the last frame of film.  I suggest all movie buffs have this movie in their movie collection.  No collection is complete without it.,1303171200,,276,4.956521739130435

7827682,5,6302540380,"This short is actually from 1932, though the product information gives the date as 1929.  It's always been one of my favorite L&H shorts, even though it might not be as gag-filled as something like 'Helpmates' or 'The Chimp.'  Ollie is confined in the hospital with a broken leg, finally enjoying some rest, peace, and quiet for the first time in ages, when Stan comes visiting.  He came to cheer up his best pal, who really doesn't appreciate the kind gesture, nor the hard boiled eggs and nuts which Stan has brought along.  Naturally, Stan makes things even worse by his mere presence, and even manages to get the eggs stuck in the pitcher of water.  Things get even funnier when the doctor, played by the great character actor Billy Gilbert, comes in to check on his patient.  What follows is pure L&H hilarity, as the weight keeping Ollie's broken leg suspended in the air is lifted off of the ground and poor Ollie is just hanging there in the air above his bed, as the doctor himself almost falls out of the window, having the seat of his pants ripped by Stan when he finally manages to pull him away from his impending doom.  Stan and Ollie are both thrown out of the hospital for all of the ruckus they've raised, and to make matters worse, Stan accidentally sat on a hypodermic needle and is seriously suffering the side effects of that medication as he attempts to drive them home!",1137369600,,1392,4.52191235059761
7827683,3,6302540380,"Oliver is confined to a hospital bed due to a broken leg or foot, in traction, yet is enjoying his uneventful days away from Stan until the latter's visit, ""...Because I had nothing else to do"", bringing Oliver a lunch that Stan eats and causing havoc when he lifts the truss weight, raising the patient above the bed while simultaneously hurling a doctor, played by Billy Gilbert, through a window; this type of physical comedy is generally inferior to the antic pair's careful buildup of mated tension that is manifested facially, of which there is too little in this carelessly organized short feature that is additionally impaired by a lengthy climactic section utilizing poorly done rear projection and deficient matching of film stock; there is far too much ""business"" in this one, and not nearly enough of the strengths of Laurel and Hardy.",1116892800,,847,4.93006993006993
