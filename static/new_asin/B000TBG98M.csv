2938034,4,B000TBG98M,"This is a very strange movie.  Eerie.  Reminiscent of  Vampire stories.  Other worldly concept. Dustin Hoffman, Alan Rickman - just two of an excellent cast.  Haunting and unsettling, and hardly forgettable.",1500163200,,207,5.548387096774194

2938036,5,B000TBG98M,"This movie was an unexpected joy the first time I watched it, and lives up to expectation on subsequent viewings.  The art direction is as delightful as the story, and it's weird enough that you can get a rise out of people who haven't seen it before.",1496966400,,251,4.340425531914893

2938041,4,B000TBG98M,It's like watching a burning building.  The casting is brilliant.  The ending is a bit far-fetched.  A fitting testament to any society that focuses on superficial over substance.,1493510400,,179,5.321428571428571

2938049,1,B000TBG98M,"This story line had so much potential but ended up utterly idiotic.  Total failure to stir anything resembling the suspense or dread that a good serial killer movie should inspire.  And, after 2 hours of waiting for something interesting to happen it wraps up with a desperate attempt to drive home the idea that we are all powerless against our senses.  There are only two good things about this movie; beautiful cinematography and Alan Rickman's speech when he confronts John Baptiste.",1487462400,,487,4.987654320987654
2938050,5,B000TBG98M,"One of my very favorite movies. It is a bit creepy, yes. But the story is very unique and unforgettable. And it is beautifully shot, and very well acted. Music is great.

2938053,5,B000TBG98M,Wow.  This is an incredibly strange movie.  I watched it twice through.  It was gripping due to the uniquely different theme of the show.  Disturbing but a DEFINITE MUST if you enjoy the strange and unusual.,1486166400,,207,4.666666666666667

2938060,4,B000TBG98M,"-My thoughts are a little scattering, so bare with me if you decide to read my review lol.-

First off... the reviews are even weirder than the movie lol. I decided to read the reviews expecting some s***s and giggles about the absurdity that is this movie lol. I was sorely disappointed in the ""raving"" reviews about what a marvelous piece of work it is. Which, granted, it isn't the worst movie I've seen but... lol. Rewinding a bit, I do like the movie. But I like it in such a way that I see it as more of a comedy (due to the freaky nature of the murderer and the odd way the film captures his ""sniffling"" haha) than I do a horror or drama. It's purely funny. The murders are terrifying, but more in an empathetic ""rape"" way. Like a woman viewing the creepy patterns of a man stalking and harming another woman, that's creepy and that part of the movie was really well done as it was unsettling. But wtf. The ending!? I won't spoil anything but what... I was so lost on what was even happening and my boyfriend and I were dying laughing watching it. It was the funniest, the best part of the entire movie purely for the comedic factor. It is a refreshing spin on the usual murderer plotlines and it is an interesting watch... I would recommend it but, again, still lost on the amount of raving reviews. I wanted to see more ""wtf did I just watch"" reviews lmao.",1482710400,,1365,4.290697674418604

2938069,3,B000TBG98M,"This film was pretty intoxicating. The storyline moved in a completely unpredictable way and I have to say, for someone who is never truly SHOCKED by any fantasy scene, the movie was pretty jaw-dropping in parts. The acting was superb but with the cast I'm not shocked. I would definitely advise anyone to give it a try if you like weird, unsettling films. :)",1477094400,,359,4.625

2938074,5,B000TBG98M,"This was an impulse purchase from a dump box at a closing Blockbuster. Had to purchase it again I loaned it so much.

This movie has a slow burn with occasional moments of flash that lead to a penultimate climax and the ending was beautiful. It has a great cast and Alan Rickman delivers a powerful and incredible performance.

2938083,5,B000TBG98M,"As an unusually 'literary' film, ""Perfume ..."" lights and frames theme and character without forcing the viewer to take any particular perspective or to have any specific experience. It reminded me a little, in tone and pacing, of the recent television series ""Hannibal"" but spared me the art house grotesque imagery. ""Perfume ..."" took a more naturalistic and understated approach to its violence as with the 'violent' birth of the principal character. I'm grateful to Mr. Winshaw for becoming a sympathetic warlock of magical realism and for helping me to experience olfactory input from mere video and sound. I'm even more thankful to the friend (a coworker) who suggested this film to me. I think it's time I read the novel from which it was adapted.",1472428800,,754,4.992063492063492

The cinematography captures the riveting demographic and the milieu of the time period, which has escaped the generalized film industry and our history books as well. The actors have portrayed the characterizations well, that one is oblivious to the ""named actor"" for the character's portrayal overrides their personal ego.

2938136,4,B000TBG98M,"Watch the movie perfume, you will notice that the story and the relationships between the characters are meaningless and irrelevant. The perfume is meaningful but illogical. Compare this movie to Avatar. Screen writers usually seek conflict with balanced characters and story. The writers of Avatar presented humans, culturally, as civilized beasts and the aliens as savage nobles, the good guys are beaten, but they find their resolve and purpose and win the day. 'Perfume presents an unbalanced story and a string of useless characters, but there is no conflict.' That is a concept. This movie was made so you would see things in a different light... What would you do if you could smell like that? What would you do if someone else could smell like that? You will not believe how many times this guy gets away with murder.",1446163200,,825,4.9

It was well filmed and the music was amazingly beautiful and haunting. Especially when he is following the first woman he accidentally kills. And the filming of his orgasmic feelings of the woman's scent after she died made me feel uncomfortable like a rape scene. Although he didn't commit any sexual act.  He is a smart criminal. And gets away with his crime. The end is just so disturbing. !!spoiler!!!The power of his combined murdered female scents creates massive orgy. Wow! Can woman's smell really have that kind of power?  The costumes were beautiful.  I felt sorry for the main character and then asked myself, WTH? It messes with the mind.  Makes me look at my perfume in a whole new way.

This movie is off-the-hook!  The character Jean-Baptiste is dark, unbelievably mad with unexplainable powers.  The movie held my attention from the beginning.  This dude was born ""special.""  I don't know how else to put it.  Good job by the actors especially Ben Whishaw and Dustin Hoffman... Alan Rickman also, but is he ever bad an anything?

2938148,5,B000TBG98M,A wonderful novel and equally wonderful movie (which is a rare case in my experience).,1440633600,,86,4.8
2938149,2,B000TBG98M,"First things first - this is a movie about a man who has an astoundingly strong sense of smell.  Like Superman strong smell.  He can smell a girl on a horse miles away.  It's hard to fathom how you can tell this story without it being a bit over-the-top, cheesy, or silly at times.  Imagine a movie that features a man closing his eyes and sniffing with great gusto multiple times and you'll have this movie.

At any given moment this movie looks like a cinematic dream.  The saturated colors, the camera angles, etc. Even big names like Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman help give the impression of a great movie.  However, this movie is none of these things.  It is an empty shell, much like the topic of the movie - overly bold attempts to create something real and meaningful from a long list of synthetic ingredients.

The movie starts with a third person narration, which seems to set the stage for a kind of distant, off hand connection with the characters and indeed, the story itself.  The main character speaks few words  and is incapable of feeling much, which transfers into the audience.  A bulk of the rest of the characters are a blur of glorified extras with the exception of the old has-been perfume master, played by Dustin Hoffman and the paranoid father of the final victim, played by Alan Rickman.  Dustin Hoffman's character is the closest I was able to feel connection to, as he had a struggle of overcoming his failure to live up to his one time fame as a perfumist.  He has a desire, he has personality, and he has longing, ego, and all the other ingredients that make a human and their story interesting to see or hear.  The main character of this film has only longing, but we really aren't given any understanding of why.  He becomes obsessed with the smell of a girl and ultimately kills her while trying to capture her scent, but he quickly becomes enamored with another girls scent later in the movie (both red heads, apparently his nose has a thing for gingers).  Why isn't he just walking around digging these smells and all the other smells of other red head ladies?  What is it that compels him to want to save these smells? We never really know.

Another issue with the story - if this man has such an intense sense of smell, which the movie pushes to the audience regularly showing him being able to smell on an almost atomic level, how could he ever be happy with any perfume he made?  Something that contains animal fats and alcohol, surely he would smell that mixed in with his essences and not be able to really call his replica enjoyable?  But I digress...

This movie is 2 and a half hours long.  If you're going to have a story to tell that is that long, it better be an exciting and gripping one.  Perfume comes across more as a semi OK story that just really REALLY took its time getting to the point.  Slow and rambling comes to mind.  Which is hard enough to handle in general, but when you don't really care about the characters or their motives, it becomes really tedious very quickly.

The ending is hollow and takes fooorrreeeever to wrap up.

I would ultimately compare watching this movie to sex that could have been mediocre if it hadn't dragged on so long, but because the other party was sooooo sure everything they were doing was beautiful and meaningful, it dragged the sex down to barely tolerable and with a grand finale that left you exhausted and bored, yet unsatisfied.",1440633600,,3431,4.508090614886731

2938166,5,B000TBG98M,"Perfume is one of the most remarkable movies I've ever seen...the premise, wh/ has a basis in fact in our biology; the ""grotesquerie"", the humor...so sad, and profound....set around the filth of  1700's Paris....10yrs before the US Revolution, more or less.

The story revolves around an orphan, sold into ""indentured"" slavery of some sort, who has probably the most acute sense of smell ever known, and his search to make the ""perfect scent"".  The protagonist is a Jesus thin waif of a boy/young man, introspective and driven; and Dustin Hoffman, his mentor, is hilarious.  The movie goes from gross (think Hannibal Lector), to funny to horrible, but we have to remember it's a work of fiction/fantasy, and follow what the author is trying to present.

I needed to add, in the critique,. it states the protagonist is born onto a pile of fish guts, thus ""establishing his repulsion for putrid scents...""  This is totally inaccurate,  JB had no repulsion for ANY aromas, he loved them all.  Trinie Dalton also doesn't know the difference between ""vile"" and vial.

2938220,5,B000TBG98M,Stylish and sumptuous movie about a young man born in squalor with an incredible sense of smell and an abilitiy to break down. reconstruct and improve any perfume formula.  He succeeds far beyond anyone's expectations  but his single-minded quest for perfection pushes him to become a sociopath and to murder as he puts together his greatest formula.  Perfect casting.  Every frame is stunningly beautiful.  You won't easily forget this movie.  I've never seen a story like this mounted as a motion picture.,1419552000,,507,5.121951219512195

2938224,2,B000TBG98M,"The translation from literature to movie is visually stunning. But the character development leaves much to be desired. It's hard to feel much of anything e.g. sympathy, hate, love, for the bland protagonist. And the movie gives you no chance to care for or even feel sorry for  his object of obsession. And the climatic sexual scene? I know it's in the book but in the movie it seems so random. A departure from the novel at this point would have benefited the movie a lot. Don't even get me started on the narration. If I wanted the Audiobook, I would have bought it.",1419120000,,569,4.471153846153846

Surprised at some of the other reviews that don't seem to understand how humanity can becomes twisted by ignorance or sheer lack of experiences most others take for granted...like being loved, educated, seen as worthy of kindness, respect and compassionate communication. The one way this character understood this world was through his sense of smell as he is never touched, seen as a thing not a person, or heard, He is desperately seeking love through the only sense he can trust. Most people do not consider the power our senses have and how they perceive the people and the world around us and therefore can become easily manipulated. Magic, the matrix, even our very existence is based upon what we believe our senses are telling us...this movie proves that point. It also shows us that the most important force in all our lives; love. Love is ethereal and cannot be trusted to the senses to determine, create or manipulate. It cannot be bought, bottled, caught, forced or maintained. It is given from one to another in a moment of time that exists beyond our worldly senses. This is the tragedy our movie portrays.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Adapted from Patrick Sskinds clammy, high-toned international best seller, Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is of interest mainly as an example of what might be called the sensory imperialism of cinema. Quite a few films, not content to stimulate the eyes and ears, try to conquer the other senses as well. Touch and taste are the favourites; hence the ubiquity of scenes that take place in bed or at a table, but an intrepid researcher could probably identify, amid the sighing caresses and laden forkfuls, an authentically old factory film tradition.

Tom Tykwer, the director of Perfume: The Story of a Murderer and also, most memorably, Run Lola Run. It tells the story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille [Ben Whishaw], a skinny, sallow young fellow who grows up in the pungent atmosphere of 18th-century France burdened with a preternaturally sensitive nose. Every stone and blade of grass, every young womans cheekbone and belly button, every piece of fruit and hunk of rotting fish sends its essence straight to Jean-Baptiste Grenouilles nostrils, sometimes from a great distance.

Tom Sskind goes full tilt in exploiting the lush, lurid tones of Frank Griebes cinematography, he rubs our noses in Jean-Baptiste Grenouilles world by assaulting our eyes with what he smells. Thus the camera lingers on rotting fish, on animal skins at the tannery where Jean-Baptiste Grenouille serves an early apprenticeship, and then on the lissom ladies who become his victims.

Jean-Baptiste Grenouilles episodic adventures are propelled along by John Hurts arch, third-person narration. John Hurt has also performed a similar service for another over-reaching European filmmaker, Lars von Trier, in his English-language theatricals, Dogville [2003] and Manderlay [2005]. Ben Whishaw, wan and jug-eared, does not quite manage to make Jean-Baptiste Grenouille either a victim worthy of pity or a fascinating monster. The fellows sensory endowment is meant to make him both an artist and an amoral killer, a social outcast who nonetheless gives the society what it really wants, but in the film Jean-Baptiste Grenouille comes across as dull, dour and repellent.

Jean-Baptiste Grenouille himself, in the unwashed streets of Paris and the fragrant lanes of Grasse, Frances perfume capital, this condition is a kind of invisibility; Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is consumed with the project of concocting a transcendental scent. After receiving some technical training from a master perfume-maker named Giuseppe Baldini [Dustin Hoffman], he sets out to perfect his own special formula, a recipe that calls for the extracted essences of 12 virgins and a prostitute, who all must be killed before the materials can be rendered. The women are thus bonked on the head, covered in animal fat and then left, naked and carefully posed, in the streets and squares of Grasse.

The town authorities panic, in particular Antoine Richis [Alan Rickman], a local notable whose red-haired daughter, Laura Richis [Rachel Hurd-Wood], conveniently possesses a natural funk that is one of Jean-Baptiste Grenouilles coveted ingredients. So intent is he on finding her that he pursues her over hill and dale, using his powerful nose to track her as she flees. The camera dutifully speeds across the countryside, and when it lights upon Laura Richis, who is fleeing in disguise and on horseback, she turns around in the saddle, as if suddenly aware that she is being sniffed.

Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is a connection between sexual desire and the impulse to kill, that tried and true German Liebestod, is proposed but never really explored. When Dustin Hoffman, who looks marvellous in velvety face powder, departs the scene, he takes any inkling of being camp or whimsy with him, leaving behind an atmosphere that becomes increasingly arid even as it strains toward sensory saturation.

This is a dark, dark, dark film, focused on an obsession so complete and lonely it shuts out all other human experience. You may not savour it, but you will not stop watching it, in horror and fascination. Ben Whishaw succeeds in giving us no hint of his character save a deep savage need. And Dustin Hoffman produces a quirky old master whose life is also governed by perfume, if more positively. Dustin Hoffman reminds us here again, what a detailed and fascinating character actor he is, able to bring to the story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille precisely what humour and humanity it needs, and then tactfully leaving it at that. Even his exit is nicely timed.

Keeping in mind that this isn't the type of film were used to seeing, some of these scenes can come off very quirky. For example, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille sniffing the air and following his nose like some sort of psychopathic bloodhound does indeed look ridiculous, but if you allow yourself to buy into the films central premise, its easily forgivable. Whats more unconventional, though, is that its nearly impossible to like and let alone relate to Jean-Baptiste Grenouille. Hes a selfish, unflinching murderer, and all his means are carried out for narcissistic ends. This isn't a case of a charming killer like Hannibal Lecter or Patrick Batemen; Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is so detached.

I really love this film because it is all character driven, beautifully acted and the cinematography is out of this world. Of course there is nothing fun about the story, except the way it ventures so fearlessly down one limited, terrifying, seductive dead end, and finds there a solution both sublime and horrifying. It took imagination to tell it, courage to film it, thought to act it, and from the audience it requires a brave curiosity about the peculiarity of obsession.

That doesnt mean, though, that 'Perfume: The Story of a Murderer' isn't worth watching. Quite the opposite, 'Perfume: The Story of a Murderer' is an unconventional and clever way to tell an incredibly interesting story, and one that I know I won't soon forget. Its not a perfect film, and like I mentioned, some scenes may come off as a bit silly. But overall, I definitely recommend 'Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,' as Im sure you haven't seen a tale of a freakish murderer presented with such depth.

Blu-ray Video Quality  'Perfume: The Story of a Murderer' is presented with a striking and stunning 1080p encoded image that both thrilled and engaged my eyes, boasting vivid colours, strong reds and blues, and a stable, well saturated palette, especially the roses in the perfumer's shop look like a painting. Fine object detail is equally remarkable, just look at the crowd in the opening scene and the long shots of the cities. Every individual in the streets is clearly distinguishable and sharp. The black levels are deep and add a nice amount of dimension to what could have been a flat, shadowy picture. Most impressive of all is the texture detail. In facial close-ups, each actor's pores, and every strand of hair is crystal clear. Shots that follow the trail of a scent are also rendered wonderfully, in fact, they're so detailed at times that you almost feel as if you've been put within the mind-set of Jean Baptiste himself. As strong as this transfer is, I did notice a couple of lingering and albeit inconsequential issues. First off, there's some occasional colour banding present around unfocused edges, look at the close-up of the child's finger in the orphanage. Secondly, some random shots of darkness have a slight cloud of artifacting [A compression artefact or artefact, is a noticeable distortion of media, including images, audio, and video, caused by the application of lossy data compression], especially watching the night sky when Jean Baptiste stares across the water at the city. I should emphasise that these issues only pop up a handful of times, and they hardly mar this otherwise gorgeous transfer. All things considered, if you are definitely seeking the Dutch Blu-ray release 'Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,' won't be let down by the visuals with this beautiful stunning Blu-ray Dutch Release and of course the bonus is that it is All Regions release.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  'Perfume: The Story of a Murderer' features an original English language track, which is presented using the awesome 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track. While the film's stellar video transfer enabled me to further immerse myself in 18th century France, this audio package did not. To be fair, there's isn't anything technically wrong with this mix and it's just dominated by John Hurt's narration and the film's musical score. The surround channels aren't used to their potential, dynamics are not so strong at times, and the soundscape is relatively quiet. On the bright side, the score's instrumentation is warm and well prioritised, dialogue is crisp, even during soft whispers part, and channel movement is subtle. The strong suits of the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and delivers a more immersive overall aural experience than expected.

Finally, 'Perfume: The Story of a Murderer' is a fascinating and surreal exploration of a demented mind. Apparently, Jean-Baptiste has an alpha and omega for his plot and the last half hour of the film was truly the strangest and most unbelievable. We are whisked back to the gathering at the town square shown in the beginning. Again, I don't want to give away this portion either, but its just as unbelievable as the first. For the most part, I did enjoy this film, strictly because the concept is definitely unusual. The most shocking scenes could be construed as not being very realistic, though. I was a bit confused by the ending, so I had to conduct further research before I understood it. Ben Whishaws performance as a disturbed individual with a seemingly placid demeanour was wonderful. Those into abnormal psychology will have a field day at this film. Interestingly enough, I came out of it with some well-appreciated knowledge: how perfume is made! Basically, go into this movie with an open mind and prepare to see some behaviour that will shock you, but does not detract from the storyline. Fans, like me of the film are sure to be entranced by the visuals on this Dutch import Blu-ray disc, and they will be easily impressed by the awesome and stunning DTS audio track and I think this European All Regions Blu-ray disc has a stunning presentation, compared to the USA Region A/1 Blu-ray Release. Sadly there are no Extras, which is such a shame, but despite that, it is still worth purchasing this awesome Blu-ray disc. Highly Recommended!

2938326,3,B000TBG98M,"The movie is true to the book for the most part.  The few sections that the movie leaves out are the weaker sections of the book, so they made the right editing decisions as far as that goes.  I wondered how they would translate the sensual experience of smell/odor into a visual medium.  Early in the movie they tried to create some interesting visual cues showing the lead character's enhanced perceptions, but that approach seemed to be abandoned pretty quickly.  The movie also utilizes spotty narration.  The first part of the movie is heavily narrated, then there's no narration for large sections.  It's kind of distracting when you hear the narrator (Anthony Hopkins?) pop in randomly to fill in a plot hole with backstory then disappear for 30 more minutes.  Dustin Hoffman really mails his character in.  Is he supposed to be doing an Italian accent or a French accent?  Maybe it's just a generic bad Euro accent.",1404259200,,923,4.791139240506329

2938335,5,B000TBG98M,"The film was fantastic; acting great, costumes wonderful, music accompanied the story well, and there wasn't a single dull moment. As a huge fan of Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, Hannibal the television series, and the lesser liked Hannibal films, I would definitely consider this Hannibal-esque. In fact, the main character (don't know if I can call him the protagonist) would pretty much be Hannibal in 18th century France without the cannibalism part; all the other little personality traits are identical.

Did not know what to expect with a title like ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,"" saw that the reviews were positive, but I didn't actually read them. I planned to do other things while watching this movie as some background noise, but needless to say this film deserves your utmost attention. Lots of little details that enhance the move can go unnoticed.

This film is not like anything I've ever seen before (plot is similar to Hannibal, but it's still very much unique), and certainly not what I was expecting. I would definitely recommend to anyone that doesn't mind dark, and somewhat gory thrillers.",1401667200,,1120,4.983957219251337

I get the pull for sympathy for the characters upbringing, but we get it, he has an unusually strong olfactory system. I loved Dustin Hoffman. I was surprised by Alan Rickman, I expect better acting from him. I don't want to give anything away but I feel like I have to in order to justify my perspective.

Hopefully I gave enough space. I completely understand his obsession with the one girl who smells phenomenal. That being said... It's quite a stretch to following her and accidentally killing her and then thinking her scent would be maintained. I get it, uneducated orphan who's worked as a slave all his life, but still, common sense and dealing with death before hand would have made you realize that. What I liked was that he tried to be sensible and take the scents from them while they were alive.. at least once. Would it have been too hard to show the girl your intentions using your own arm first before freaking her out. Yea, I get it. It's a movie and I'm being to critical. Just things that popped in my head during the film, like how coincidental the prostitutes dog shows up while he is away after all that time and digs up the clothes... or the key left on the desk like ""here, take it"". If the dog could smell it, he could probably smell it. And it's clothes, not bones, you could have burned them or left them with the victims. Also a city like Grasse allowing 13 murders to take place, Jack the Ripper had about 5 victims and the whole city of London went crazy in an effort to stop it. But by far the weirdest part was the ending. Really? Eaten? That was so dissatisfying. How does it lead to orgies in one area and cannibalism in another? Which, BTW, gross orgy, not that it was meant to be attractive, more artistic. I would have liked to have had more info on the basis of his choices for victims. Dustin Hoffman went into an explanation of making a perfume and then all that seemed to go out the window. I'm overly critical, I know. I apologize. It's just things that gnawed at me in the movie that I had high expectations for. I really like the idea of the power of scent. It just fell short for me.",1397520000,,2410,4.366071428571429

Somewhat off the beaten path, it tells the story of a young boy who is gifted with a discerning and sensitive sense of smell. As he grows into a man, this gift turns into an obsession and through his desire to capture smells so as to never lose their scent he ends up becoming a murder. Even more interesting, however, is how the plot unfolds to the ending--definitely not what you might predict! The acting is superb, and cinematography extremely well done, and the set design is just beautiful. Like ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" this film is a feast for the mind and eyes. (Although the soundtrack is not nearly as good as John Williams' work). I also appreciated that the film was not overly graphic and at times was even slightly funny. This is not a movie about murder and gore, but is a genuine story well worth the telling. In my opinion, this film should have been nominated for best picture.

As an independent filmmaker there are few films I find worth five stars let alone leave me mystified and anxious to rev up the old camera and give it a go myself.  This film is amazing!  Thought-provoking for starters, and that's putting it lightly.  The entire storyline is enrapturing, and what begins as a reality show ends up as a fairytale.  You have to see it to understand why I was so mesmerized by it, as was my husband.  We have watched it twice, and are getting ready to see it again--it is that riveting.  The cinematography is astounding!  Brilliant in so many ways.  The script was exceptional, and the directing even better.  I can't say enough good about this film.  I'm amazed that I didn't hear more about it when distributed.  Actually, I'm shocked.  It has every attribute that a film needs to be a blockbuster award winning film.  Hm, politics?  Could be.  Dustin Hoffman's role is short and sweet, but appropriate.  His character was definitely engaging.  Alan Rickman also performed credibly without damaging the delicacy of his character.  The main actor was absolutely superb in every way, but it was a compilation of fine acting, directing, and cinematography that made this film stand out above all other serial killer films.  Additionally they did a fabulous job of recreating the period pieces to make this film so true to life you actually feel as if you are living in the time.  I will look for more of Mr. Tykwer's films in the future.  If you're a serial killer addict, this is the film for you.  Different and memorable.",1391817600,,1584,4.700729927007299

2938416,3,B000TBG98M,"My review of the movie depend on weather I included the ending or not.

In head cannon the movie ended about 10 minutes before the actual ending of the film.  That would have made the film have meaning and would have actually made it good.  But the existing ending really spoiled it all for me.  I was left staring at the credits and blinking in disbelief that it all built up to ....THAT.

But before that, I was enchanted.  The movie is GORGEOUS.  It is brilliantly acted and directed.  The grim filming style becomes as much a statement as the films narration.

While you are given a reason that the main character is the way he is, you are never pressed to like him.  He is presented as he is.  Warts and all.  You are never allowed to wallow in his circumstances and feel sorry for him.  He is amazingly acted.  A masterful performance that truly, and with very few words allows you to FEEL and understand what the character is going through.  The way he SEES smells, what they do to him.  How deeply he is in love with the world of scent. He is delightfully feral and portrayed  that way, stripped of the norms of society.

The actors pay lavish homage to their roles and not a single part is miscast.  The costuming is wonderful.

The story is gripping and interesting as you see this lost child evolve into a man and then devolve again.

The story takes you to the mountain top....raises you all the way to the top and then....and then ....it makes lame excuses and leaves you there like a bad first date.  It feels like the scriptwriter just didn't know where to take it and figured...well I gotta stop sometimes so um.....it's getting late....forget the rest of the movie, I am going to bed.

It either needed to be shorter or longer.

I concede that I have not read the book, so perhaps I am missing some deep literary allegory.  Or perhaps this is just freaking creepy and another veiled attempt to objectify women.  That said, the acting was phenomenal and the music and film quality were flawless.  Alan Rickman was perfection, as usual.

2938457,5,B000TBG98M,"This a movie of a man obsessed with scent. He loves them all and makes no distinctions between bad and good scents.

I am someone who adores perfumes and have quite a collection so the beginning of the movie really touched a chord with me about how he soaks in all the scents almost as though they were tangible objects. The movie does a good job of showing the smells as tangible objects, too.

I found the move to be wonderfully haunting, beautiful cinematography and when the search for the ultimate scent leads to him murdering women (although why he couldn't have explained what he wanted to do beforehand, then got a woman who was willing) it felt like a child who wonders why he gets hit by a truck when he runs out on the road.

All he wanted was the scent, this kind of magical, awesome scent that would change the world, and because he murders to do it, the movie is deeply dark and haunting.

I have never seen a film quite like it, and I have never read the book though I tried but all the descriptions slowed the pace too much for me.

The ending was a bit farfetched as if one drop couild transform a crowd of people, so I felt this was overdone, but the main character does a good job of being this darkly strange man who has trouble escaping his obsession, until he just gives into it and searches and searches for the scent he knows he can create.

This did not feel like a horror film to me. No mistake, I was disgusted with his methods with the women, but this was no gory, slash and burn kind of film.",1383264000,,1521,4.227586206896552

2938485,4,B000TBG98M,"I have been complaining about wanting to see some original stories and not so many re-makes and my voice was heard. I have to say that beware what you ask for! This is a morbid story to say the least, but it is one of the best productions that i have seen in quite a while.

 The story is about human survival against all odds and rewards (Whishaw) Jean Baptiste Grenouille (student perfumer) with an increadable gift of olfactory excellence/precision that is extremely rare. His gift comes with a price tag attached that will come back to haunt him late in the movie. J B could not of had a harder life since his birth and life in an orphanage where he is treated as an oddity to be feared. He is sold for a small fee to a tannery owner when he was not worth keeping and his space was needed for a younger child.

His life wasn't any better at the tannery and he had only a five year life expectancy of hard labor. He finds his chance to pursue his quest to smell everything in the world and to preserve the scents for eternity when he delivers goat skins to a washed out perfumer (Baldini) played by Dustin Hoffman. Baldini is in need to copy the latest perfume that a rival is cashing in on, but his nose is failing him and he can't figure out all the ingredients needed to reproduce the fragrance. JB seizes this opportunity and makes a deal with Baldini and tells him he not only can copy it, but he will make it better in trade for Baldini teaching him the in's and out's and how to preserve the fragrances. Baldini buys JB from the tannery owner and they begin their student/teacher relationship with a few minor problems and this tutelage/job is the first time in JB's life that he is more or less happy. They share everything and JB makes Baldini a very happy and a even more prosperous man, but JB wants to learn more because he has a desire to capture this one fragrance that consumes every fiber of his being.

He leaves Paris for the town where Baldini learnd how to be a master perfumer to hone his skills and to fulfill his deepest desire/quest to capture and preserve this ultimate fragrance. His life takes a few steps backwards at his new employer akin to the tannery, but not as bad and his gift allows him some freedom to pursue and master his techniques for extracting his essential oils.

I have left out certain key elements to the story so I wouldn't spoil everything. I just wanted to give you a basic understanding of his life and his story. The last twenty or so minutes are pretty crazy and more than a little over the top and at this time he learns about an even more precious gift the gift of ??? .

 The acting, story/plot, direction, editing and cinematography are all top shelf and combined tell this provcative story in an unforgetable thought provoking way that I think will stay with me foe awhile. Is this a perfect story/movie?  No it isn't for many albeit small reasons like the accents of the French cast members using distinctive English accents or Hoffmans lame Italian accent and a few other minor oddities. The two deaths related to JB's harsh life and the scene near the end,  but they don't take much of anything away from the movie. 4+ stars

2938489,3,B000TBG98M,"This is not the 2002 film ""Perfume"" that centers on the fashion industry but rather the 2006 film adaptation of ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer."" This was a 1985 literary novel by German writer Patrick Sskind. The film is directed by Tom Twyker and is a visually graphic depiction of the development of the serial killer he calls Jean-Baptiste Grenouille. The story begins in a fish market in France in 1738 with his birth in the most wretched circumstances imaginable and follows his life in a rather documentary-style narrative that is dispassionate and adds to the grotesqueness of the plot.

This is not your ""feel-good"" movie, nor is it one with an anti-hero you feel sympathetic toward. The filming is stunning. Actually the whole movie rather stuns more than entertains one. I cannot say I love it or like it but it is disturbing and thought-provoking. It is not something to watch in a depressed state of mind I think and even the exquisite photography does not make me want to return to it. Alan Rickman as the father of a victim of the serial killer is powerful. John Hurt is the narrator and his  marvelous voice carried me along through this ""tunnel of horrors"" movie. I recognize the power of the production and story but can't view it in terms of ""liking.""",1373760000,,1272,4.674107142857143

2938510,5,B000TBG98M,"This film is another of many directed by Tom Tykwer, a particularly inventive German director who works frequently with American actors.  There's also a book,which I haven't read. Ben Whishaw is a very talented actor, who has appeared in a great many different roles, including Ariel in Shakespeare's The Tempest, with Helen Mirren as Prospera; Bright Star, directed by Jane Campion, about  John Keats, the great British Romantic poet who died very young and his girlfriend, Fanny Brawne; and done a superb job in each of these very different roles, Whishaw also appears in Tykwer's Cloud Atlas, as a musician.

In Perfume, Whishaw plays a man raised in utter poverty in 18th Century Paris after his mother gives birth to him in the Paris market and tries to throw him away in the garbage. He is called Grenouille (Frog) from birth. He survives relentlessly because something is driving him to persist in spite of neglect, abuse and savage attacks in the worst slums of Paris.  He is driven by a love of smells: he makes no distinction between good and bad smells, just any smell fascinates him.  Finally he accidentally bumps into The Smell he's been searching for when he makes a delivery to a formerly famous Paris Perfumer (Dustin Hoffman) who is down on his luck, and Hoffman realizes thiat this grubby, inarticulate person is a genius who will save Hoffman's declining business.

What Hoffman's character doesn't realize is that Grenouille wants to distill young women into perfume. It's not clear just how this might be done in real life; all we know is that Grenouille stalks them, kills them, and hangs them up in a huge tub of  some liquid element until out of each body a small vial of perfume emerges.  He moves to the town of Grasse, where the French perfumers thrive: the town has become rich from their success.  There he proceeds to capture his victims and make them into different bottled scents.  Finally his evil doings are discovered and he is sentenced to a public execution (decapitation) in front of an immense crowd of angry Perfumers in the city.  I can't reveal just how he rescues himself from this situation, which is too bad because it's one of the best moments in any movie I've seen . . . the entire town suddenly adores him when he waves a handkerchief doused with his girl-distilled perfume at them.

This book is based on a novel I haven't read.

2938511,1,B000TBG98M,"I decided to watch this movie based on the description, the actors, and the decent reviews.  I am reviewing this movie because I found it to be a complete disappointment.  I came to this movie with the knowledge of it being based on a well-received book, but I have not read it.  My opinion is based solely on the movie.

The movie was beautifully made.  The setting, the people, the costumes.  I found that all to be believable and it pulled me into the movie.  Initially there were parts I liked and parts I had to suspend belief a bit to watch, but I do not have a problem with that.  If I like a movie, I like it.  It doesn't matter if it got poor reviews or if I understand why others don't like it.  So I kept watching.  Warning:  Spoilers to follow.  Don't read further if you don't want to know what happens.

Here are some of the problems I had with the movie.  Each on their own I may have been able to look past, or even a couple, but when put together, it was just too much.  A man can smell a perfume and recreate it IN SECONDS, grabbing CLOSED BOTTLES of essences from around a large room without pause, even though these bottles are clustered with countless others.  He pours these essences in the proper quantities and shakes them together, voila, identical perfumes.  This same man thinks he can preserve the odor of a cat by basically boiling the cat.  Having seen blood and death, it never occurs to him that the scent will change from the living cat to the dead, cooked cat.  The man, trying to follow a woman who smells good to him, figured out that she left town, and what direction she went in, simply by waking and breathing.  From what was apparently miles away.  In open countryside.  So incredible is this man that, using the scent of over a dozen women (now dead), he was able to release a few drops of this incredible perfume, turning an angry mob, screaming for his death because of all the women he murdered, into a mass of people who now saw him as an angel and proceeded to have sex in a courtyard with the person nearest them, no matter how unlikely the match.  They then all went to sleep there or passed out while he escaped.

The man journeys to the place he was born, which he found by smell, because apparently the place smelled exactly the same as it did when he formed the memory as a newborn.  He then douses himself with the rest of the fragrance, entrancing a smaller group of people (huh? really?) who are so taken by the fragrance that they CONSUME him on the spot.  Yes.  They ate him.

I honestly expected to be mildly disappointed that this was a dream just before his death.  My disappointment was so much greater when I saw that this is supposedly what happened.  I was willing to accept everything up until he created a scent that was able to enchant people the way it did.  I can honestly say out of all the movies I have seen, plenty that I liked and a fair number I did not, this would have to be the very last movie I would recommend to anybody.

Again, I did not read the book, and it is entirely possible I would feel differently.  If you haven't read the book and you've made it this far in my review, well, you've been warned.",1369440000,,3186,4.2725752508361206

Exploring our olfactory sense, on film no less, would seem a daunting task but it is handled here excellently. All of our senses have spectrums of sensations. Those who put together pictures for our eyes, tastes for our tongues, fabrics for our skin, music for our ears and, as in this movie, scents for our noses attempt to be experienced in the contrasts that each of these senses can utilize. How are we to know sweetness without knowing the sour? The light without the dark? This exploration of the hidden realms of the world of scent is an amazing achievement.

2938562,4,B000TBG98M,"""Perfume"" (2006) was directed by tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run, The International) and is based on the 1985 novel os the same name by Patrick Suskind. The story takes place in the 18th century and tells the magic realist story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) who was born with an extraordinary olfactory ability which led him in his quest for the perfect scent. Dustin Hoffman also stars as the perfume maker Guiseppe Baldini, whom Jean-Baptiste is an apprentice under. Jean-Baptiste is something of a social misfit who comes to realize that he has no scent of his own unlike other people. This sets him apart from others and makes him somewhat invisible, scent wise, from others. His quest for the perfect scent is something of a search for his own identity in the world. Lacking a social conscience this amoral character murders women in order to acquire their scent for his perfect perfume mix. This diabolical enterprise leads to a surprising turn of events in the later part of the movie. In a movie which feels largely realistic in the early parts it becomes pure magical fantasy towards the end with an amazing conclusion. This sumptuously filmed movie takes us through the gritty streets of Paris and into the splendid gardens of the wealthy Antonine Richis (Alan Rickman), who lives in perfume capital of the world in Grasse, France, along the French Riviera.

The dvd has a 13 minute long feature about the making of the film with interviews with the director and cast. The dvd is of a very high quality with dark blacks and rich colours.",1362268800,,1553,4.794776119402985

The story is based on the gift of smell. And the drive to retain a certain one. The main character does a good job at making you sad and mad at the same time ...for doing what he does to women which is to murder just to retain the one smell that captured his attention and he can no longer have.

At one time the screen rights were owned by Stanley Kubrick, and, being a huge admirer of Kubrick, I can think of no higher praise than to say I find it hard to imagine the master himself having done that much better with this highly tricky and challenging material. And, to echo what many have already said here, this is a love-it-or-hate-it experience, I fear, with the multi-pronged ending being especially devisive, though also astonishing. And the casting, starting with the absolutely DEFINITIVE choice of narrator, the great John Hurt (whose narration for 'Dogville' was equally perfect), and continuing on to even the smallest role, is unerringly right. And with its wondrous cinematography and rich musical tapestry making almost palpable this almost obscenely rich world of scents, both good and evil, 'Perfume: The Story Of A Murderer' may be hard to warm up to but is impossible to forget.

If you thought the fifth season of Breaking Bad was disappointing, then you will feel let down with this movie.

The personality of Grenouille (frog) gives us absolutely nothing to invest in or care about (not even his nose or talent). No line is drawn between his abandonment as an orphan and his curiously detached state. In a nutshell, this is not the reason for which fairy tales were created.

If the tale had been told in the voice of Alan Rickman, as the father of the beautiful daughter we see towards the end of the story, and if Rickman's character had, during the course of the narration, done analysis on the difference between a child who is abandoned and a child who is loved, perhaps the story would have made a little sense. But it does not. Even the massive orgy in Grasse doesn't make that much sense and the viewer cannot help but wonder, ""What about those with damaged olfactory senses?"" After all, not everyone can smell your perfume. It was interesting but I was unhappy that I invested the time it took to watch this movie.  I was glad Grenouille died at the end, but I wish all his bones could have been broken first.  He was not even human.

His career as a murderer comes about because of his obsession with scent, particularly that of young women, which I imagine is related to his early deprivation.

2938618,3,B000TBG98M,"The film, ""Perfume"", directed and cowriten by German director, Tom Tykwer, is based on a novel I read shortly after it was published in 1985. I recall then thinking that is was an odd story, which seemed to have few cinematic virtues. This movie tends to confirm my point.

The first thing which strikes me is that the dialogue is thin as a weak broth, made from old bones. I find myself in disagreement with several professional critics when I say that the most enjoyable scenes in the film are those with Dustin Hoffman as the old Parisian perfumer, Baldini. Those scenes have at least some reasonable amount of exposition by a character rather than the clinical voice of John Hurt who does the narration, an unseen voice. Some critics complained about Hoffman's over the top acting, a bit too ""kitch"". Well, maybe it was, but it seemed to be one of the few traces of real life, however ""overdone.""

My strongest memory from the novel was the discovery that the main character, the infant who was to be given the name Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, played by relatively unknown actor Ben Whishaw, had no smell whatsoever. This comes very early in the novel, setting the scene for what is to motivate the principle character throughout the story. This revelation does not come out in the film until about 2/5 of the way through it, leaving us with no strong explanation for why Grenouille is so entranced by the smell of the young apricot seller (the Wikipedia plot summary says plums. They look far more like apricots to me.)

The unique absence of all sent from the child is replaced in the film by its beginning with a scene where Grenouille is sentenced to a horrible execution. Most of the remainder of the film is a flashback about his life leading up to that scene, which plays out in a manner which should confirm (if nothing up to that point does not drive home this point) that the story is a fantasy. But it's a fantasy based on a very slim extrapolation of reality. What if a human had as acute a smell as a dog, for example. This is played out when Grenouille demonstrates for himself that his extract of the fragrance of his first victim is recognized by that victim's dog. We are reminded of this evidence later in the film.

For those who are annoyed by spoilers in reviews, you may wish to stop now.

I found several scenes in the film which were simply too unrealistic to accept, similar to a Sci Fi movie about people in outer space where they can hear sounds in the vacuum of space or they walk as if there were gravity where there can't be any. The most jarring was in the execution scene, where, having been stripped to the waist and chained to the wall of a locked cell, Grenouille manages to retain possession of not only his vial of perfume made from the 13 essences of the fragrance of his 13 victims, but he retains a handkerchief by which he can disperse the fragrance to the crowd assembled to view his execution. Perhaps the whole unreality of the scene is signaled when Grenouille arrives at the execution stage dressed like a dandy, in a carriage fit for royalty, instead of the hay cart we are so familiar with from the French Revolution.

Less ""unreal"", but similarly jarring was the scene in Baldini's laboratory where Grenouille creates an improvement over a perfume Baldini was trying to copy. It was reasonable to believe that Grenouille's talent enabled him to identify the five or six components of this perfume, but as he himself states, he knows the smells, but he does not know the names or how to capture them. So how does Grenouille assemble the components he needs by selecting sealed containers, with labels. The business as Grenouille enters Baldini's laboratory suggests he can distinguish each of the smells from the hundreds of containers by smell alone. I suspect that would be beyond the capabilities of even a bloodhound.

Bottom line is that the film is about the sense of smell, which may be virtually impossible to convey in a film. But wait, wasn't there a very successful film entitled ""The Scent of a Woman"" which seemed to succeed in conveying that idea. The very slow pace of this film, with precious little dialogue to speak of, tends to be just a bit boring. Which is odd, because my memory of the novel was that it was anything but boring. Here, Hoffman, pulls off a good scene or two, and Alan Rickman is almost totally wasted, with very little dialogue. If the roles of Narrator and  Antoine Richis, the 13th victim's father, were reversed, at least we would have been treated to Rickman's delightfully serious sounding voice. Hurt's voice seemed to lack character, the same way the principle character lacked a fragrance.

The proper bookends of the film perhaps should have been Grenouille's triumph in finding a proper fragrance to replace his own lack of one.",1343347200,,4826,4.6416861826697895
2938619,5,B000TBG98M,"This movie is outstanding for many reasons:

It is a visually beautiful movie with top notch acting performances, appropriate pacing, a seductively dark and original plot with a climax/ending that leaves all of the fantastic olfactory notes of the movie to develop in the viewer at their own pace.

A more detailed report below

1. Outstanding cinematography: There shouldn't be any debate on this; the movie is gorgeous.

2. The acting is superb: Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman are, as expected, excellent and Ben Winshaw portrays a very convincing sociopath.  Laura's actress disappoints slightly, but Laura does not contribute much to the actual plot other than her existence so i found the acting to be easily overlooked.

3. Brilliantly Paced: The movie is as methodically paced as its main character, creating an appropriate and comfortable tempo.

4. Dark dark dark dark dark: I understand that the chilling and disturbing is not for some people and that is ok, you most likely won't enjoy this movie then. But if you are like me and are captivated by psychosis and the investigation of evil (i.e. Silence of the Lambs, The Shining) then this movie is certainly for you.

5. Original concept: Nothing more to really comment on that front... watch the movie.

6. The end: (no spoilers) many people claim it to be unsatisfying but , personally, the movie couldn't have ended in a better way. The main character, in his mind, was at the end of his story. So the movie ends. The ending doesn't have to be believable or realistic because the movie is FANTASY. If one complains that this movie is unrealistic and therefore somewhat unenjoyable, then they might as well say the same thing about any superhero movie/story.

6 1/2. AGAIN... the movie is FANTASY. Do not pay any mind to other reviewers criticizing Perfume for being unbelievable and unrealistic because that is simply not how it is presented. Of course no one could have the sense of smell that Grenouille does... accept that aspect as a given of the story's universe if for no other reason than because the level of realism in the movie is largely irrelevant to its plot, characters, and presentation.",1343088000,,2167,4.880108991825613

The movie follows a young child, from the moment he is born in a fish market stall in Paris in the 1700s, through his life as he seeks to express his unique gift, an advanced sense of smell.  I won't give the whole story away but to say that his talents eventually bring him great opportunities, that become twisted because he simply lacks understanding of societal rules and moral code. He is an untrained hungry lion, set out in front of lambs. He cannot resist his temptations and was not taught to nor brought up with how to funnel his desires for expression using positive avenues.
It was a phenomenally interesting story, wonderful directing, great acting and set design. My only issue, was the ending sucked eggs. It was a horrible let down to such a tremendous journey and build up of the story.

2938655,5,B000TBG98M,"How exactly do you make a movie about smells? After all, a movie is all about sight and sound. Touch, taste and smell rarely come into it.

But acclaimed German director Tom Tykwer manages to make us smell things, in his most disturbing movie to date, ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer."" This time around, the talented Tykwer abandons his usual lovers-against-the-world stories for a lushly-filmed, darkly comic story of olfactory obsession. Yes, that is what I said.

Jean-Baptiste Grenouillle (Ben Whishaw) is a man with a brilliant sense of smell, and zero body odor. He was born in a putrid fishmarket, raised in an orphanage, and later escapes from a tannery where he was working. He's enraptured by the many thrilling smells in the city -- he even kills a young girl, so that he can smell her lovely scent.

In his search for the perfect scent, Jean-Baptiste gets a job with a once-famed perfume-maker (Dustin Hoffman). But after learning that not everything has a scent, he begins killing women to try to distill their scents into the ultimate perfume -- with beautiful redhead Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) as the ""thirteenth scent."" But his ultimate scent has an even more sinister side, as his scents begin to affect the population in unusual ways.

""Perfume"" is Tykwer's most unique movie to date, and the one that definitely identifies him as a cinematic master. There are lots of music that are evocative, sensual, colourfully beautiful, or unspeakably creepy, but not many manage to be all of them. ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is all of those, and more.

Obviously a movie doesn't smell like anything, except maybe stale popcorn. So Tykwer uses sight for smell -- rotted fish, maggots, moldy walls from the late 1700s to show Jean-Baptiste's miserable origins. And he uses sparkling colour and windblown trees for nicer scents. Colour takes the place of scent itself -- bright red Lola hair on multiple girls, flowers that seem to pop out of the screen, fresh leaves, brilliant fruits, even brightly coloured food. It gives the visuals a fairy-tale vibrancy.

In fact, the scripting almost comes second to the exquisite cinematography. Yet Tykwer is able to bring across the powerful symbolism that brings the movie to life -- the smells are symbolic of love itself, which the scentless and amoral Jean-Baptiste does not have. He can only try to take it from others, with a finale that is the very image of poetic justice.

Jean-Baptiste himself is one of those love/hate characters, and Whishaw does an excellent job with his sort of half-crazy, intent stare. And there are some great supporting performances by Alan Rickman as Antoine Richis (Laura's dad) and Hoffman as the eccentric old perfume-maker -- he adds a welcome note of comedy.

A movie is dependent on sight, but Tom Tykwer creates a movie that you can almost smell. ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is darkly comic, bizarrely beautiful movie, and definitely worth seeing.",1296345600,,2955,4.93158953722334
2938656,5,B000TBG98M,"It is, I believe, a very special feeling; a frisson, indeed, to experience - to anticipate watching a movie made after a great cult novel, and all the apprehension, the scepticism, and yet,the hope arising each time the visual medium invades the realms of literature; one can just mention ""The Name of the Rose"" to illustrate the point.

I'd held all the apprehensions one is guaranteed to hold on such an occasion, and was prepared to make concessions for the director who challenged the ""unfilmable"" verdict for the novel.

I didn't have to. The movie demonstrated the astonishing combination of audacity and artistic sensitivity to the medium. I appreciated the editing effort to adapt the book for the screen ( such as ""truncated"" story of Jean-Baptiste  with his much shortened stay in the cave, or the omission of the episode with Marquis lest it would distract from the final objective); other deviations from the situations, described in the book,as well as slight additions, I found justified either by the medium, or by the artistic task the director obviously set for himself: that is, to create a sense of Jean-Baptiste's determination in realising and achieving his goal.
  I'm glad the director  treated the end without gory, explicit details, demonstrating the true sense of power of his medium and staying true to the aesthetics of proportion and measure which harks all the way back to Aristotle and which, certainly, was upheld during the epoch in question.

2938664,4,B000TBG98M,"The year is 1766, and Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is born amid the filth of a Paris slum with an unusually well-developed sense of smell.  He grows up in an orphanage, never knowing a kind word or deed, perceiving and relating to his harsh life only through smell.  When as a teen, he sees a beautiful young woman for the first time, he becomes obsessed with capturing her essence in a perfume, but to do this, he must kill her.  She is but the first of many young women who will be used to create a scent of perfect beauty, innocence, and even love.

In the beginning, the ugliness and brutality of slum life were so realistic I often had to look away.  In contrast, the second half is set in a beautiful countryside amid luxurious surroundings.  The photography and set designs are excellent as are the period costumes.  Whishaw gives an intense performance as the asocial, amoral anti-hero, an unlikable but fascinating character.  Dustin Hoffman is miscast as an Italian perfume maker.  His American accent and deadpan delivery are laughable and out of place.  Alan Rickman is very good in the small role of a nobleman.

The story of a serial killer's desire to capture unattainable essences is engrossing, with final scenes involving 750 naked extras that are quite bizarre.  It's an  unpleasant but curiously intriguing story. 3.5 stars.",1279238400,,1354,4.834782608695652

NOTHING about the plot is realistic. It is ALL totally absurd. For example, one CAN distill the essence of roses by distilling their oils out of many pounds of rose petals.  Does this suggest that you can distill the ""essence"" of a beautiful woman by either boiling her entire body in a kettle of hot water (a la chicken soup) or alternatively by spreading animal fat on her skin and scraping it off and then distilling the glob?  Not likely, yet this this the central premise of the movie.

Who can buy into such nonsense?  The final scene is a farcical sex orgy in which 750 or so naked people make love in a town square -- all while somehow always hiding their private parts from the camera's view -- all under the capative spell of the fragerance of 13 slaughtered women.  Right!!  That makes sense, right?

2938670,5,B000TBG98M,"I read some reviews on this film and decided to pick it up on DVD a few years ago and I am so glad I did. This movie got essentially no promotion in the US so I am surprised that I even stumbled onto it. This film had me hooked right from the ugly beginning of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille's birth in the most vile and repugnant place imaginable.

The narration by John Hurt is tremendous and intriguing, as is the film's musical score. I found the score's instrumentation, coupled with the operatic female voicing, quite beautiful, immersive and evocative.

Make no mistake, this is a dark story that is not for everyone. I feel the twisted tale is told in about the most filmic and gorgeous way possible, given the uncomfortable subject matter. The cinematography is amazing, as is the direction of photography throughout the film. The colors pop off the screen, particularly the doomed and gorgeous red haired beauty in the film. Take notice the depth, detail and color in her eyes, skin, clothes and hair, I was awestruck.

This movie comes with a strong recommendation from this viewer, although my tastes are admittedly more towards the dark and macabre. However, there is an abundance of grace and majesty in this fairytale that is sure to appeal to any astute film fan.

The film's video transfer is very solid and looks great with few issues. Color and depth are superb, along with solid black levels throughout.

The film's primary audio tracks are DTS HD - HR (no lossless track exists on this disc) in English and German. All the extras are in German as well. The higher bit rate DTS lossy tracks do a solid job and are an improvement to the lower bite rate DD lossy track on the US DVD release. Surround activity is very limited; perhaps a full lossless codec would improve this, it's hard to say.

I would think that a US Blu Ray release of this film will come eventually but who knows when that will be; since this movie has little recognition in the domestic US. If you are a fan of Perfume, this release is a substantial upgrade to the existing DVD and well worth adding to your collection.

This imported Blu Ray played perfectly in my US Region A Sony BD player so there is no region lock on this disc. I picked up a copy for $27, including shipping, from a UK seller on ebay so be sure to shop around before spending $40+ on this disc from Amazon or another seller.

2938672,5,B000TBG98M,"Anyone who has ever complained about big budget movies being predictable, cliche-ridden, shallow, pandering, stupid, style-over-substance, etc. ect. should see this movie.  I knew I was in for something special when the movie began in 18th century France and people looked unhealthy, filthy, & stench-ridden.  Although I must note that they did not get the teeth right.  Up until last century, oral health for the majority of the population was of little concern.  By in large, people's gums were diseases, and their teeth ugly, and their breath beyond foul.  Which reminds me to remind you to floss (only approx 25% of people in N.America do), and find out how to do it right.

The story itself possesses fantastical elements, and there are anachronisms, so this isn't just an attempt at a literal recreation of the 18th century France.  So don't think that the movie is going to be one long dreary stench-fest.  Rather it is like an adult version of a Grimms's story, or maybe Hans Christian Anderson.  I would advise against reading any reviews, because this movie is best approached cold, and especially on Amazon where the do not have a SPOILER policy.  So if you want something different than the latest Hollywood romcom or special effects screen vomit, check this one out.

Oh and if you have a thing for real Redheads like me, you've got to see Karoline Herfurth in this one.  And she is a real redhead although they did color her hair to make it more visually striking.  Unfortunately, shes the only real red in the movie.",1266624000,,1531,4.797709923664122

What a wonderful surprise to find a work of art about the passions evoked by smell. I've long been a sucker for ladies with that beautiful sweet natural scent that's impossible for perfumes to imitate. It's the scent of love, energy, desire, sensuality. And I know it is real and so powerful you don't even need to see a girl to desire her.

Our protagonist also falls in love with this scent, in fact thanks to his exceptionally good nose, he knows it better and feels it stronger than anybody else. But due to his unfortunate and isolated upbringing, is unaware of how one goes about experiencing this intoxicating pleasure. And experience it he does.

Some say that the book this movie is based on is even better. I don't know, I only just found out there was a book. The movie is a masterpiece on its own. My only reservation is that the last 15 minutes with the mass hysteria didn't do justice to the rest of the film, therefore no full marks. 9 out of 10.",1262822400,,1018,4.375661375661376
2938674,5,B000TBG98M,"I have, to date, seen three films by Tom Tykwer.  Two of them are are masterworks of cinematic art and one of these, Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is as great a film as I have ever seen.  It is comparable to a statue by Rodin or a painting by Van Gogh or a Bach fugue.  It is entirely new -- something never seen or done before; and, even though what it attempts is disturbing and dark and morally ambiguous, it succeeds in doing it in a way which can only be termed, gorgeous and perfect.  One never sees a single wheel or gear.  One is simply inhaled, like a breath, into the nostrils of the protagonist, lives inside of his dark entrails and continues to do so long after the end credits have rolled.  The cast is used to perfection. Ben Whishaw performs a tightrope walk of balancing the audiences reaction between revulsion and empathy and never sways once on the rope. Dustin Hoffman devours his part with a gusto which we have rarely seen from him in recent years and Alan Rickman proves, once again, that he can do anything.  The film is narrated brilliantly by John Hurt.  Tom Tykwer, Bernd Eichinger, Andrew Birkin and Patrick Sskind turned an ""unfilmable"" book into a masterful screenplay and Tom Tykwer just moved to the top of my best-director-of-all-times list.",1262649600,,1278,4.526086956521739

2938677,5,B000TBG98M,"""Perfume"" is an absolutely stunning movie.  It grabs the viewer from the first moment when a baby is apparently stillborn under the table of a fishmonger's stall amidst garbage and fish innards, in one of the slimiest parts of Paris. But the baby fights to live and live he does despite his desperate beginning and childhood.

Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is shunned by everyone: his social interactions are abnormal and he cannot relate emotionally with anyone, except to protect himself.  However, he does possess an extraordinary skill: his sense of smell.  He can smell things that other humans do not believe have any smell at all, e.g. glass, copper, stone etc. His goal in life becomes how to capture the essence of smells, particularly those of the human soul.

This quest leads him to develop methods of preserving human essences, but in order to retrieve them, he has to kill the people whose essences he desires.  They are all beautiful young women.

The story starts as a ""true"" tale told in flashback and  it seems totally believable, even though it is fiction.  The filmmakers also generate an atmosphere that makes you think you smell what he is smelling too--an amazing feat.

This is an exceptional film, not quite like anything else I have ever seen, except perhaps ""Sweeny Todd"".  This is far superior and is spectacular on every level.  The ending is grisly but so are the crimes he commits. This is a one-of-a-kind experience and highly recommended.",1256860800,,1466,4.914634146341464

I was completely enthralled by the story and taken by the literary genius behind the tale and its originality.  So when I found that a movie version of the story was out, with Dustin Hoffman, needless to say, I was anxious to see if the film could live up to the vividness and depth of the book. THe film does not disappoint.  It's a good condensation of the story; and although no film version could ever hope to plum the depth's of Grunuiu's psyche so well as the book, the imagery and musical backdrop adequately convey the character's oddities and social deficiencies(to put it mildly). Although not nearly as moving or disturbing as the book, the film nevertheless satisfies.",1251331200,,902,4.69620253164557
2938683,4,B000TBG98M,"Many excellent reviews precede this one, I'll try to put this in a Who Should, and Who Shouldn't, see this film format, with a few extra comments thrown in for good measure.

People Who SHOULDN'T see this movie:
People with a low tolerance for extremely graphic images (e.g. a young orphan holding a dead rat up to his nose for an extended olfactory exploration, accompanied by a CSI like sequence in which the boy can smell the maggots inside the rat).
People offended by naked bodies, LOTS of naked bodies, including an orgy.
People that need a hero, people that feel they must admire the protagonist.
People that like technicolor movies, but black and white justice.

People Who SHOULD see this movie:
People that either tolerate or enjoy startingly graphic images.  If you can tolerate the TV series Bones, you'll do just fine.
People that are tired of movies that trundle along in familiar ruts, and love the thrill of a movie that gets completely out the track and goes careening all over a cinematic/dramatic field.
People that watch human behavior the way a birder watches magpies, buzzards, and hawks: they want to see what HAPPENS, NOT to make moral judgments about the carnage taking place.

For those of you fence-sitters, what might tip you into picking this DVD up:  lush photography, deep sensuality, mostly good acting (come ON, Dustin Hoffman, you can say ""Basta!"" better than that!!), and a truly thought provoking exploration of the world of scent.

A few minor gripes about the author of the book and the director of the movie.  WHEN can we humans get off the virgin thing? Specifically, the FEMALE virgin obsession (no one is going to write a book about the perfect scent being composed of the essence of male virgins). Secondly, during the orgy scene, we see man on woman/woman on man (required for mass audience appeal), female on female (men seem to like this), but no male on male (unless I missed it, maybe I should go back and watch it several times?).  A bit of timidity in film-making here?

Lastly, the book, though set in the past, has a bit of a sci-fi aspect to it (pheromones ramped up to spectacular levels).  The hard sci-fi lover in me notes two things.  First, were an aerosolizable chemical that directly and lastingly accessed the pleasure centers of the brain ever developed, it just might have the affect portrayed in the movies.  BUT, a small proportion of the population is anosmic (lack a sense of smell).  Someone in the crowd at the climactic scene would have arranged a very different ending than what we saw.

So much for splitting hairs.  I? I love a movie that is a bit socially derailed, and mentally deranged. Perfume, The Story of a Murderer, smelled wonderful to me.",1249776000,,2721,4.735169491525424

2938685,1,B000TBG98M,"It's--a movie. Lots of money was spent on it apparently.  It's great to see Dustin Hoffman's grandfather is still spry and getting work. Perfume is really--well it's like--remember when we had to read long novels in school and we wished somewhere in the book, the earth would open up and--well, it kind of happens here kind of. I think the rodent was the tip off. But man when they sell a movie, they really hook you and--ok--it's not something I would--I didn't watch the interviews with the film makers cause--ah--I didn't want to spoil the bouquet.

And of course death has its lingering scent--Andy Warhol's Frankenstein proved that--it's just--well--it's a long movie or maybe not. And it is based on an unfilmable novel--some reviews say--and I'd take that as a measure of warning--well what I'm trying to say,  without spoiling the surprises, and that is one tough thing to do--let's just say you may be singing Good Morning, Starshine or Hair by the time the perfume just soaks into everything--the room, the furniture, the aforementioned hair--

It's just--getting back to that what we would like to happen in the middle of a novel we're forced to read in school--and you want to run from the room when your face is just about as full of blood as it can get--that rodent scene kind of makes one feel the same way--course the stench of France then--well--you gotta smell then you gotta smell, I say.

Remember Hans Conreid on an I Love Lucy show reciting his poem that ends with ""....I just love to stand there and smell""? It's kind of a huge practical--well, I don't want to spoil the vintage here--I would have loved to have seen this in an art theatre--not really--and go around giving the audience a hot foot--cause that would be liberating--kind of symbolic too I guess--

Oh come on, the movie stinks, the thing is a practical joke, there is one line toward the last that will leave you in hysterical laughter, so see the thing, really, cause it's just one of the most--well, you remember Goldman's law concerning more than one writer, or two writers--this film could have used William Goldman as script doc--don't think I'll be buying the novel it's based--it's based on a novel? Lord. Is there no shame?

Any how..it's a movie to give one that smell of delusion, not to mention the drugs they must have been on when they made this--you remember Snidley Whiplash? And how we hated him? But we loved him too cause he was so Snidley. Doesn't have anything to do with Perfume: The Story of a Killer--just wanted to mention it. But it's good Dustin Hoffman's grandfather still gets work--his house caves in--well--it's like they're saying just how long can they string us along here?

And from some of these reviews apparently a long long time. It's a movie about murder. And it's--well--the breakout comedy hit of the year. Get that blu-ray--yep--do get that blu-ray. Honest. It's a love in, yes sir, with some of the ugli---well never mind. You can tell people about the movie. And they will take one giant step back from you and look around nervously for the nearest exit.

Oh, I tried to like it, too. I remarked at how beautifully filmed it was and I enjoyed the mood the director set. But, the fact that I didn't like it doesn't mean I didn't ""get"" it. I got it. But, there's a reason so many of the negative reviews mention ""The Emperor's New Clothes"".

The movie was all dressed up in oversaturated colors and gorgeous scenery. The acting was good enough and the premise even interesting. But, still, it was repugnant. The idea that everyone can forgive Jean-Baptiste for the atrocities he committed because he created something that seemed to be of overwhelming beauty  is repulsive. Slaughter isn't beautiful.

And, that's the thing right there. I didn't read the book and don't plan to. Yet, I understand what the filmmaker was doing and what the author of the book was trying to do. However, it doesn't work unless you realize the joke is actually on those who enjoyed it. Those who LIKED the film are those ""masses"" in the orgy scene-- pseudo-intellectuals seduced by a perfume or a pretty set created with disregard, blood, and pain.  The murder of innocents isn't beautiful no matter what nice things are created from their blood. This film is fake art and fake beauty. Those of us who understood this also understood that the orgy scene represented the blind and gullible public at large, easily seduced by charisma, by a pretty scent, by a moody set even though there's no depth and no soul and no intellect and absolutely nothing redeeming at all.

So when a movie comes along that promises something unique and creative, I just have to watch it. This was certainly the case with this one. Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was born with a very special gift. His nose. He was able to smell things that very few of us can.

But he was so obsessed with capturing smells, that he killed so that he could hold on to that smell. This is sick enough, but the end was so upsetting and so strange, that it made me sick myself. The movie is a very dark physoligical thriller, which is why I found this part to be especially odd.

It seems that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille created a perfume that was so captivating, so hypnotic that people that smelled it were put under some sort of spell.

In the one scene is question, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille unveils his new perfume. The entire crowd of a few hundred take off their clothes and engage is a huge orgy.

Now if this were a comedy, perhaps I could except it. But this, is a serious dark thriller. I don't get it. And the scene was soo disturbing, that it brought down the entire movie.

2938692,5,B000TBG98M,"German born director Tom Tykwer slows things down quite a bit in PERFUME: THE STORY OF A MURDERER. Those in the know are probably aware of Tykwer's ultra-fast paced&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Run-Lola-Run/dp/B00103584Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Run Lola Run</a>(1998) in which the action never stopped. But here in Perfume we get to see a completely different Tykwer, one with an eye for beautiful camera shots, incredible vistas, and stunning cinematography.

Problems with the film became apparent, however, before the film ever got green-lit. Several directors considered the project before opting out. Among them were such notables as Ridley Scott, Tim Burton, Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman, and even Stanley Kubrick (may he rest in peace). But fate - or karma or whatever you might believe in - intervened and plopped it in the lap of Mr. Tykwer, who quickly decided to make this feature event a spectacle beyond most imaginations. With an incredible budget of over $65 million (the largest ever from a German production company), the film was shot with an eye for artistic quality along with a flowing script. And it worked. It worked very well.

The dark sets of 18th century France come alive (and frighteningly so) thanks to the shadowy sets and creepy main character of Jean-Baptiste Grenuille (Ben Whishaw,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Layer-Cake/dp/B000IFQLG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Layer Cake</a>), a man with a gift for smells. Born to a careless and soon-to-be-dead mother, Jean-Baptiste's life is put under the microscope for the entire audience to see. Since being born on the streets of France (literally), Jean-Baptiste smells all of its greatness and stench. Being shuffled first to an orphanage where he fights for his infant life, to his life as a tanner, to his eventual acceptance into the business of a down-on-his-luck perfumer named Giuseppi Baldini (Dustin Hoffman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Panda/dp/B00168OINK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Panda</a>), Jean-Baptiste demands more and more from his marvelous sense of smell. In fact, he wants to be able to bottle the smell of glass and other intangibles. Maybe even capture the scent of ...life? Beauty? Oh yes, even that.

During a visit to the streets of France, Jean-Baptiste encounters his first truly magnificent smell, that of a lovely redhead. But her fear of him leads to her death and Jean-Baptiste worries he may never get that scent back.

His fears are side-stepped, however, when he learns how to capture the smell of beautiful women, but only after killing them. Dread grips the countryside as women of all socio-economic classes are found murdered.

A man with an acute sense of danger named Richis (Alan Rickman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweeney-Todd/dp/B001BN1ZHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweeney Todd</a>) realizes the danger his only daughter Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is in and decides to flee with her across the country. But can distance save her when a human bloodhound is on your trail?

Jean-Baptiste needs Laura in order to finish his scent de excellence and nothing appears to be able to stop him ...except for himself. His life has been a pursuit that no other person can share, and this has made him a truly lonely figure ...if not a non-entity in terms of humanity itself.

This film came very close to being one of my top ten favorites, but fell a tad short thanks to what many call ""the orgy scene."" Although it was a nice twist from what I thought was going to happen, it really, really, REALLY stretched the imagination beyond any possibility of realism. Even so, it was filmed exceptionally well.

Most surprising to me was that I hadn't realized how long this sucker was. At nearly two-and-a-half hours, it whizzed by; that's how engrossing much of the production was, including the acting, the (amazing) sets and costumes, and the sumptuous cinematography (pay particular attention to the red hair, especially when Laura is fleeing on horseback with her father).

The use of a narrator was wonderful and enhanced the movie (Whereas a lot of narrated movies flop in my opinion because they don't know how to use a narrator, especially an omnipotent one}. Visually the movie is simply stunning. They take an abstract and fanciful story and put it in a visually realistic movie, which makes it simultaneously more believable and fanciful. Now the ending had two problems for me. I am not a huge fan of nudity in movies, but up until the end the nudity was tastefully done and in context did not offend me. However toward the end was a mass orgy where I found the context of the nudity unnecessary for furthering the plot. You can understand perfectly well what is going on without the nudity or even the mass orgy. My second issue was that the ending pushed the fanciful aspect of the movie into an area where I had a hard time suspending my disbelief in order to continue enjoying the movie.

From this moment on you are aware that this human being's life will be different from the average person's. After years of suffering abuse in a harsh orphanage and being forced into slave labour as a young adult, the question of whether criminals are born or nurtured begs to be asked.

While the film reveals early on that this boy is ""gifted"" with a superior sense of smell, leading to olfactory obsession, it is wrong to assume that this automatically leads to criminal (murderous) proclivities. The film is thankfully vague about this.

In this way the film, like all true art, does not beat you over the head with easy answers, nor does it pontificate an agenda, rather it lets you witness events as the proverbial fly on the wall, and encourages you to ponder whether criminals are born or nurtured by and EXTREMELY harsh and unforgiving society.

Despite his crimes, I felt that given his past, I am more empathetic to criminals and may be less prone to judge.  For me, good films challenge my world-view, great films challenge my morals.  This one does both.

Although this is not a ""popcorn"" film, or something that you would automatically sit down to watch with your family, it is powerful and provocative nontheless.  Despite its bizaare perfume-fetish-theme, it is socially relevant.  It is unfair to say the film is poor because it makes you feel depressed or horrified.

The plot has been gone over, so I won't do that again. I will say that everything about the movie was in prime shape. Actors, sets, costumes,story line, music.... it all came together into an amazing, repulsing masterpiece of a wondrous story!

This film is about 150 minutes and yet is worth every bit of it. I would compare this film with greats like Prestige, Passion of the Christ, Amadeus and maybe even American Beauty. I compare it with Amadeus because of the setting, the extraordinary sets, with Prestige because of how effective and tactful the film-making is - unpredictable. Why I compare it with Passion of the Christ and maybe even Apocalypto because of the crime & punishment factor. It is American Beautyish because the central character goes through certain varied self-absorbed emotions to get what he wants. And then the character sees nothing but he wants and what he must do both in and out of order.

I do not know why people didn't like the film. I'm happy some didn't get it. I am now looking forward to reading the book. I will not bother recommending this film to people who I think won't like it, simply because this is a film only to be appreciated by someone worthy of understanding it's craft and poignance.

2938701,3,B000TBG98M,"Watching Perfume I found it a fascinating film up until the moment of the orgy scene.  Listening to Tom Tykwer in the ""Making of..."" I can believe he saw it as a metaphor for celebrity in our time. Yet the orgy and everything that followed it struck me as false. I wasn't squeamish about the bodies, though I did start wondering about the folks involved with the shooting, but it seemed to me that it was also related to the concept that the genius can break all of the rules and somehow that is excusable. The Producer says that the film is supposed to be amoral, that is without a moral compass. So in the end the overwhelming shared erotic experience somehow excuses the 13 plus girls who had to die to make this divine scent, in other words the film really winks at human sacrifice, implying that when it comes to our sexual desires nothing is more important. (This interpretation is underscored by Alan Rickman's character asking for forgivenees.)

I know the whole thing is a fable, yet it certainly does have a moral bearing: The truly gifted person is not understood and is thus excused for treating their fellow human beings execrably, if they can produce something miraculous. I would have accepted the orgy scene if they had gone all the way and ripped each other to shreds or done what ""his people"" do at the end, rip him to shreds and eat him. But ironically their final cannibal act is treated like a benediction in the film.

The intricate sense of smell basically drives the film - specifically the sense of smell of Jeane-Baptiste. One would think this would be impossible to portray on film but it was quite ingeniusly done through the actors and visual effects.

Huge, huge kudos to the casting director who found this actor who played the awkward but genius Jean-Baptiste.  I honestly don't think that any oscar-winning actor could have pulled this off as well as he did.  Jean-Baptiste is socially retarded, perverse, even demonic and yet, the way he is portrayed in the film, you can't quite decide whether to be disgusted by him or feel sorry for this disconnected loner.

The ending is quite a twist in the story.  Very unexpected and quite extroardinary.  But it is also, to put it bluntly, kind of gross.

2938712,4,B000TBG98M,"I greatly enjoyed Perfume.  It was well cast, well acted, well written and the sets were astounding.  But what really won me over was the fantastic subtext that developed as the story went on.

Sure, there's a ""to catch a killer"" aspect to the film which, on it's own is enjoyable to see played out.  But there is so much more being said in this film.  Paris is depicted as a city of two classes.  One, a filth-ridden cesspool of poverty.  The other, a wealthy exclusive minority who at once co-exist with the filthy poor and at the same time pretend they don't exist.

The rich can't help but see AND smell how awful conditions are for the poor masses, but cannot be bothered to consider the injustice of it while living their lives of excess and privelige.  Perfume, very much a staple of upper class fashion, is a vehicle for this social denial in the film.  A luxury available only to the wealthy, perfume is a way to ""cover up"" the unpleasant social truth that exists all around the them.

One of the invisible poor is the main character of the film.  Gifted with a special talent, he becomes determined, (in his twisted way) to break through his purgatory of invisibility and capture the distilled olfactory essence of human beauty itself.  His mission leads him naturally to target, infiltrate and affect the world of the wealthy.  He doesn't do this by pretending to be one of them though. Instead he uses his invisibility to his advantage, much the way a virus might infiltrate a body undetected, then make it sick.  There is a social class subtext at work here that should not be missed.

Toward the end of the film, the plot takes an unexpected turn.  Not a gimmicky M. Night turn, but a fascinating one that transcends even noble social commentary.  It offers a messianic connotation that actually adds further depth to the story and leaves you with much to discuss and consider.  Overall, a great watch.

2938720,3,B000TBG98M,"The first noise Jean-Baptiste Grenouille ever made sent his mother to the gallows, and death followed him for the rest of his days.  So begins the truly unique film ""Perfume: The Story of  Murderer.""  Though classified as a German film, ""Perfume"" is spoken entirely in English with some French writing. Based on the German novel of the same name, the story of the life of Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) can be viewed literally or as spiritual symbolism.

From his birth, Grenouille was different. Born with an incredibly powerful sense of smell, he experiences the world (set in Paris in the 1600's) primarily through scent. Orphaned and raised into a life of near silent servitude, naturally he is socially inept, and his only concern is to experience all the smells the world has to offer.

Upon his first visit to the market in Paris, he's immediately taken in by the overwhelming smells of the places, people and products around him, particularly the perfume boutiques.

Smelling is his way of experiencing the world, but his attention is absorbed entirely when a young woman selling fruit passes him by. He follows her, becoming completely enveloped by her smell. When she sees he has followed to her home, she screams. Attempting to muffle her screams, Grenouille accidentally suffocates her, but his remorse for taking a life is immediately dwarfed by his compulsion to take in her smell. He rips her clothing off and passionately begins smelling every crevice of her body, basking in her scent. But it quickly fades, and panic sets in. He mourns the loss of her scent more than the loss of her life.

It is at that moment he becomes determined to learn how to preserve smell. He finagles his way into becoming the apprentice of Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) an aging perfumer. Grenouille wows him by not only replicating, but improving on the formula of a competitor's hottest selling perfume, rejuvenating Baldini's failing business.  As he studies to find a way to perfectly preserve smell, Grenouille shows a total disregard for social niceties, and even life itself. He eventually leaves Paris for the small village of Grasse, when he believes he'll learn everything he needs to know. Before he leaves, Baldini tells him of the 12 parts of every perfume, and the legend of a 13th part that would make the ""ultimate perfume.""

 13 parts to the perfect perfume It is the meetings between Baldini and Grenouille that opens the spiritual symbolism of the film. Baldini says that an object's soul is in its smell, and this simple comment reflects in everything that happens in the film. From here, the viewer can choose to see things as they literally happen, or in a spiritual sense. When his first victim died, was it really her soul that was leaving her body, or did she simply stop producing pheromones? The real effects of pheromones in perfume have been debunked in recent years, but the novel was penned over 22 years ago.

On his journey to Grasse, Grenouille is horrified to learn he has no smell/soul of his own. When he begins to target beautiful women to preserve their smells, one can't help but wonder if he's not trying to steal their souls as well.

I was with this movie until the bizarre ending, which I'm guessing is the reason Stanley Kubrick believed the book could not be adapted to the big screen.

Despite the title, the movie is not really about murder. There are no gruesome death sequences, and in fact, most deaths are not shown on screen. Instead, the focus is on Grenouille's actions to preserve them and use them as parts of the ultimate perfume. The story of a murderer really becomes the story of a soulless man looking for a way to fill the void.

Though the story itself was interesting, I was more impressed by presentation. Grenouille himself goes long periods of time without speaking, but great cinematography coupled with an intense score builds a strong understanding between the audience and the characters. I have to give a lot of credit to Director Tom Tykwer for finding a way to dramatically and accurately represent the rush of emotions Grenouille experiences from a sense that cannot possibly be shared with the audience through the given medium. I mean, how do you communicate smells on film?

This is not to say the film is without its flaws. As mentioned earlier, the ending (the last 30 minutes) lost me despite its accuracy, and some points go well past the line of overdramatic. I would have enjoyed seeing more about how Grenouille avoids being caught despite the efforts of law enforcement and how a completely uneducated man develops a system of smell preservation beyond what any other individual in the industry had done. The overall package still stands, but the weaknesses are apparent.

Final Score: 7

2938721,4,B000TBG98M,"Of all the movies about deranged killers, this is probably the most intriguing one yet produced.  Set in post-Napoleanic France, the story follows the tragic life of a man, Jean, from birth to death, and how his scent of smell leads him to do ghoulish deeds.  You see, Jean has the world's most acute sense of smell, both in terms of sensitiveness, and ability to distinguish two smells that are almost identical.  Growing up in an orphanage, his ability sets him apart from the others.  He finally escapes and discovers the smell of women; specifically attractive virgin women.  This sets him on his goal of creating the perfect perfume, one made out of the scent of virgin women.

How does one classify this movie?  It has scenes of suspense, but these are few and far between.  There is comedy, but it is black comedy that is grim.  There is murder, but no blood or gore of any sort.  And there are numerous scenes of attractive, naked women; but our protagonist only rubs their smells from their bodies without ever taking advantage of them.  It is best classified as a drama; one meant for adults only.  The story is very original, probably the most original story of any film released in 2006, even though it is based on a book.

What I found in that movie's place was another movie, a more interesting one with an interesting cruel side, and that was really worth a watch. We start with a man hat claims he can identify any smell in the world and that he wants to own them all. To do this he has plans; some of his plans seem not-so-bad at first but then they take on a darker shade. And that's where the fun begins and an interesting story starts playing out.

One of the main reasons this movie was so successful was the ability of our lead character to seem so many things at once. Sometimes you cold taste the menace that swirled around and sometimes you could see other pieces of persona swimming around in his tangled expressions. The life he gave tot the role was amazing because of this - I expected few things going in to the movie but I really didn't expect someone to so brazenly steal the spotlight.
He was perfect.
The support cast was really god as well, and all these efforts combined helped build a rather interesting storyline that I would have missed if it had not been for a suggestion on rentals.

It's definitely quirky and not exactly for everyone, but if you're into things that are a bit unusual... AWESOME.  It's a story of a boy with an abnormally keen sense of smell who becomes obsessed with the smell of women.  He learns from washed out perfume maker (a fabulous show by Alan Rickman!) how to extract essential oils and sets out to make a perfume like no other.  There are certainly some disturbing scenes, as with any story of a murderer, but mostly this movie is funny, well thought out, and quite refreshing.

2938726,3,B000TBG98M,"Jean Baptiste Grenouille's (Ben Whishaw) birth foreshadowed his future.  His fishmonger mother squirted him out like the four stillborn babes before him.  When she believed him dead, she left him to be tossed with the day's guts.  His cry saved him--and damned his mother to the gallows.

From there, the baby went to an orphanage, raised just old enough to be sold as a servant to a tannery.  A trip to town taught him there was more to smell than just dead animal hides.

His sense of smell brings him to the attention of once famous perfumier, Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) who teaches him everything he knows--until his protege tries to cook down the cat to gain its essence.

From there, he continues in search of the perfect scent and discovers the best way to obtain a truly divine perfume--which happens to be rendered from the rendered fat of women he killed.

""Perfume"" details the killer's process of 'discovering' his perfect perfume.  As one might expect, the dehumanization of of Grenouille's own life gave him no concept of any other--animal or human. His progress from animal killer to human serial killer is grisly, shocking, and far too realistic.

Cinematography was excellent. Whishaw, Hoffman, and Alan Rickman as Richis, a local nobel desperately seeking the man who killed his daughter, were all convincing. Certain elements of the story were unfortunately somewhat surreal.

""Perfume"" is a one-time view for me.  The story pushed far too many buttons for me--and frankly was slow enough in more than one place to make me want to stop before the end.",1198022400,,1577,4.909433962264151
2938727,3,B000TBG98M,"In a year that featured such imaginative gems as ""Pan's Labyrinth"", ""The Prestige"", and ""The Illusionist"", it was inevitable that a pedestrian effort like ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" would get lost in the shuffle.

It isn't a BAD movie, it's intriguing at times and mostly watchable, but it's never really convincing.

Because the plot is basically a fairy tale, or fable, preposterous on its face, I think that the book was probably better at conveying the symbolism and underlying themes of obsession and the nature of art.

The translation to the screen is uneven in its tone and in the performances of the actors.  Ben Whistshaw plays the wraith-like boy from the streets, Grenouille, who is gifted with superhuman olfactory senses. He can whip together a perfume like a bartender making a cocktail, but he has ZERO personality.  He's a total cipher, and the movie is built around him.  Figure in torpid performances by Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman (a poor man's David Thewlis) and it doesn't add up to much.

""Perfume"" has a visual palette that is harsh (acid greens and blues, ugly yellows)and a storyline that sometimes seems too obvious--- like the carefully arranged nude female victims, who look like they are auditioning to be art school models.

It isn't the worst period piece I've ever seen--I would just say it's undistinguished.  I can easily think of better films to spend time with. ""Restoration"", ""Ridicule"", and ""Angels and Insects"" are films that cover some of the same ground as ""Perfume"" in a far better fashion.",1197849600,,1545,4.934362934362935
2938728,4,B000TBG98M,"Perfume: The Story of a Murder is a fresh and stunning film which effectively combines the best of the world of cinema. From the opening title sequence to the credit reel, the film moves flawlessly from scene to scene painting a picture with careful strokes, creating breath-taking images (scenes outside Grasse in the lavender fields, architecture in Paris[Prague]). The story is masterfully tailored to the confines of a feature length film and the actors capture the time period and feel of the movie very well. The best aspect of this film, however, is the orchestrated musical score. Not only does this music strongly fit within the atmosphere of the movie, it adds an element to the film which takes it beyond another mysterious thriller film. What's more, this score has legs of its own - as an independent collection of music it is representative of some of the best contemporary classical music compositions. The tension and harmony of the film are perfectly captured and distilled in the themes of the score.

While I will continue to accept the ending of this film/book the way it is, I wished for less of a departure from Grenouille's behaviors prior to the last eighth of the story. I think the fanaticism and surreal tones of that section take this film out of a five-star category, but the redeeming qualities remain.",1196899200,,1332,4.86784140969163

Yes, the settings are very nice, and you can indeed feel the grit and the poverty of the lowly minions that toil away in servitude within the bowels of the city.  What turned me off of this movie was the ending, which completely went into la-la land.  I was expecting a much different ending, one where the main character perhaps came to see that his search for the perfect perfume was not worth the lives he took to get it.

2938731,3,B000TBG98M,"I read Suskind's work as an undergraduate ... and its details are still grotesquely etched on my brain. I cannot say that I ""liked"" the novel, but I was engrossed enough to complete it. Fast-forward a decade ... and the same applies to Tykwer's film-adaptation.

Within the first few seconds, I felt a visceral repulsion to the film (as the viewer is expected to). The quick-cuts of the putrid marketplace creates revulsion and distance ... which is why many viewers here expressed a sense of ""not caring about the characters"" (this is valid). Likewise, Tykwer (true to Suskind) resists romanticizing Paris ... few directors are this straight-forward. The place is revealed as filthy, with a near-tangible stench (this is why we see members of aristocracy holding scented handkerchiefs under their noses). Even the long-shots of the city show stained, unappealing building facades. Who knew an artist could create a visual so fetid that the viewer can actual smell it?! Brilliance.

Hoffman is convincing is his role as an aging perfumer. His portrayal of Giuseppe Baldini is as amusing as it is compelling. Likewise, Alan Rickman's ""Richis"" may be the character with whom the viewer can align her/himself. He is the voice of reason ... all of his ""paranoid"" obsessions are completely justified ... but no one will listen. His frustration is ours. Still, this is not enough to forge a connection between the film and the viewer. We find ourselves not caring when his beautiful daughter is being hunted for her scent. (And there is an attempt at garnering emotion ... evident in the delicate replacing of the flower on her mother's grave).

This is a film with no catharsis (which is fine), but couple that with its dreary setting and vulgar displays, and the film becomes impossible to ""like."" This does not mean the film fails to intrigue, it simply means that a viewer may walk-away feeling empty. And, perhaps worse, wondering why the film was created at all. And, yes, it is true that Kubrick was intrigued by the text, but found it ""unfilmable."" I wonder what spurred Tykwer to tackle the text a master found ""unfilmable""? One is forced to assume hubris was at work here ... and this gamble was not a (TECHNICALLY) successful one. The budget for this work was a staggering $65,800,000 and was an epic, box-office failure. In fact, I have never before or after read such a vehement review from the much esteemed Chicago Sun-Times Richard Roeper: ""Hated this movie. Hated it"" (his literal words). Still, consider the equally (perhaps even more) esteemed Ebert who found it ""brave"" (to paraphrase). I think it may be JUST that polarizing.

My middle-of-the-road review is both an acknowledgment of the film's artistic merits and a recognition of its tendency to evince viewer-apathy (including mine).

If you have an interest in seeing Suskind's work on-screen buy this film. If you were a huge fan of ""Lola Rennt"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Run-Lola-Run/dp/B000021Y77/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Run Lola Run</a>) then buy this film.

2938732,5,B000TBG98M,"This is, in my opinion the best movie of the year.

The story may be unpleasant to some, but I thought it was an amazing story/fable set in a beautiful place(France) I believe around the turn of the century.

It is the story of a boy born in a gutter (literally) and left to die. This boy was born with a gift though, the gift of smell.

Immediately following his birth,
his Mother goes to the gallows to hang, and he goes to a horrible orphanage in his first years. Later on he is sold as a slave, and leads a horrible existance- Until he meets a perfumer who teaches him the art and skills in making perfumes.

The most important thing in life to him is that he learn how to preserve smell. The smell he is so fascinated in preserving, is the scent of women.
Once he learns that you cannot distell a living thing, he travels to Grasse, the leading perfume maker to learn another art in preserving scent.
Along the way he begins murdering women, which leads to his capture, and an AMAZING ending.(This film is also VERY educational as it shows how perfumes are distelled and become oil, and also, all the chords of a perfume ie: heart chord, head chord and the base etc. the basic ingredients etc.)

Even though there are unpleasant parts in this movie, it has the charm of a fable,The same BEAUTIFUL cinematography as ""The Illusionist"" did, and the characters were SO well cast.
The main character especially.
His very soul shows in his eyes.honestly. He was a WONDERFUL actor.

I don't know why this movie got so little attention.  at least RENT it, and check it out. I guarantee you will buy it to add to your collection.
It is THAT good.",1193702400,,1642,4.399339933993399
2938733,4,B000TBG98M,"It's tough to get past the first few minutes of this Perfume: Story of a Murderer, given the images of the seamy side of 18th century Paris and its denizens (human, animal and insect).  But in the overall scheme of things, those discomfiting sights are necessary to give you a sense of the supernormal sense of smell that the protagonist, Jean-Baptist Grenouille possesses.

From the moment of his unfortunate birth under a fishmonger's table this is a tale of the full spectrum of scents, from horrid to euphoric.  Ben Whishaw plays the role of a boy abused by his world, who grows into a talented perfumer that pursues a horrific quest for the perfect scent.  Make no mistake, he's a monster, but his story is far more compelling than that you'll find in any Saw-like slasher porn.  This is a man capable of tracking a scent to it's source even through a squalid city.

As a quasi-slave working in a tannery, Grenouille discovers his passion when he encounters Guiseppe Baldini, a master perfumer past his prime deftly played by Dustin Hoffman.  He demonstrates his innate ability by duplicating a scent for Baldini simply by finding the various components and deftly mixing them to perfection.  Baldini quickly realizes that his new apprentice is capable of returning his shoppe to the limelight and undertakes to educate him in the craft of perfuming, and Grenouille's obsession (no pun intended here at all) grows into sociopathic proportions.

After learning what Baldini can teach him, he moves on to the city of Grasse, famed for it's method of enfleurage perfuming, where he learns more and his gruesome quest accelerates.  He decides that the way to create the perfect perfume is to capture the essence of 13 beautiful women.  When his first attempt with a prostitute encounters a little difficulty (she's more than creeped out at his style) he resolves that his victims must be killed first, in a manner that does not overly alarm them (think ambush from the back).

Whishaw is capable in the lead role, however the movie is raised a notch by the performances of Hoffman and a few others.  Rachel Hurd-Wood is luminescent as his final target, easily giving you the impression that she possesses an essence of rare power (okay, that's a little over the top, but the whole theme is a little beyond the realm anyway).  And Alan Rickman is as solid as he always is as her protective father, a man capable of CSI-like analysis.  Finally, John Hurt lends his voice to that of the narrator, an often overlooked role that all too often gets in the way of a story but here it's necessary.

It's gruesome in the extreme, and there is a fair amount of nudity (much of it post-mortem), but the story is absorbing beyond what your delicate sensibilities might suspect.",1193702400,,2766,4.779411764705882
2938734,5,B000TBG98M,"The narration in perfume is a separate strand. It was added to keep the character of Grunuis free of emotion. As the director himself states, this is an amoral story, there is no blame. I think this is an amazingly well done film. Few films leave your mind pulsing with questions, but this one does. It has subtlety, and though it is superficially a story of a serial murderer the deeper implications are profound. I will say this is not a movie to watch if you like happy stories, filled with happy characters, and happy endings. It contains grisly images and will make you feel highly uncomfortable. It will also provoke deep thought.

If you want to think deeply, you will have a nose for perfume.",1193702400,,700,4.555555555555555
2938735,4,B000TBG98M,"Well, I really was just bowled over by this movie. And for the record I give it 4 1/2 stars, with a half star being deducted for the uncharacteristically poor performance from Dustin Hoffman who was really just miscast.

First of all, the cinematography. This movie is so unbelievably lush, you just sit and watch the colors and sounds cascade across the scene, in almost erotic vibrancy. I definately recommend watching this on a big high def system if its available. The reason for this is that the entire movie is about smells, which is rather hard to convey via our current AV technology. However with just a smidgeon of imagination you can almost catch the odeous odiferousness of the putrid stink of the streets of Paris, or the heavenly inebrient of the lavender fields surrounding Gras, filmed in the beyond idyllic location of Provence.

The opening scenes of the absolute, utter, completely wretched, squalor of Paris is enough to send some running for a bucket, however their vomit would only further serve as a testament to the power of this film's images.

Secondly the messages behind the movie, are some of the most provocative in any debate arsenal, and ones which there really will never be an answer to. I speak of the debate on judging the work and not the artist. Now of course most people will say that they will judge art without bias in concern to the man/woman who created it. However, when we are presented with the almost sociopathic actions of the main Jean-Baptiste the Super Smeller in Perfume, this becomes a task easier said than down. I mean, could people really sympathize with Beethoven's music, claiming it as potentially the greatest ever written, if they knew he was a pedophile (he wasn't to the best of my knowledge, but for the sake of argument...he was).

Also it is shown that Jean-Baptiste could create purfumes of stunning quality using the already practiced and un-harmful methods already in use, and yet still he strives to create a scent which to smell is to know the face of God. What if there was a tenth symphony for Beethoven to write that if heard would immediately induce absolute nirvana upon the hearer and forever after all other music would sound as nails on a chalkboard. Of course many would want to listen to it, however would so many be clamoring for Ludwig to compose the jaw dropping mind melting 10th if he had to kill, say twenty people to complete it. This is of course completely ridiculous, however Perfume, is a fantasy story, as one learns by the end, and for the sake of argument, this is the argumen that the viewer must decide on.

Needless to say, these are some of the more challenging arguments for people to cope with, and Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, presents such heavy themes with beautiful, (sometimes heartwrenchingly so) scenes, as well as excellent performances from most of the cast, especially the lead, Ben Wishaw as well as Alan Rickman.

WATCH PERFUME, I, as only an unknown set of words and opinions can, assure you that you will not have seen another movie at all like Perfume, and if nothing else, seeing a movie that is not the same ol' crap with different actors, is enough of a reason to eagerly pop Perfume into your DVD tray.",1192752000,,3227,4.682539682539683
2938736,3,B000TBG98M,"Jean-Baptiste, an orphan born in the street markets of England, possesses an extraordinary sense of smell.  Obsessesed with the scent of a woman (pure innocence), he goes mad trying to learn how to preserve that very scent.

With a narrator telling this slow drawn out tale, the viewer is quickly enamored by the ""Hannibal-like"" tone of this movie.  I know I was!  I enjoyed the long drawn out scenes of silence as the narrator weaves the tell of Jean-Baptiste and his quest in becoming a fine perfume maker.
Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as the aging mentor!

Those who love a mad thriller that builds you up with frightening anticipation will not be disappointed...that is...until the very end.  The gore is not too over the top.  The lead's obsessions with smells is a bit kinky, even funny at times, but totally understandable in the script.

Let's talk about the ending...I won't spoil it for you here but I will tell you it's way over the top and just silly.  It doesn't fit the tone of the rest of the movie.  It's too supernatural like and totally unexpected given the events that have already taken place.

Here's what should have happened and would have left this viewer a bit more satisfied...Jean-Baptiste should have been executed for his crimes.  Done!  Finished!  The lead dies!  He has to.  He's already been caught.  However, maybe a few days later his 13 bottles of oil samples are discovered by a child playing in the barn where Jean-Baptiste worked.  The child opens the 13th bottle and takes a whiff.  The camera comes in close on the child's nose and the nostrils inhaling, the same scene we are first treated to in the beginning of the movie.  It's enough to let us know, or at least let us think, this child posesses the same quality and maybe a new perfume maker (killer) will be born.  The End.

For those who are fans of movies like Silence of the Lambs, From Hell, or any Jack the Ripper, old England-type scary movies, definitely don't miss out on this one.  You'll feel cheated in the end, but it's definitely worth a look.",1192492800,,2051,4.620498614958449
2938737,5,B000TBG98M,"This movie is a horror with a fairytale quality due to the random narration, and though there is very little humor in this dark tale, it does have some surface beauty that propels it far above your ordinary horror story.  I love the unique twist on a serial killer obsessed with capturing the 'scent of a woman'.  His first kill is accidental, but once he advances his craft of separating a flower/woman's smell and putting it in a vial, he can't seem to stop until he's captured the scent of every beautiful woman he's ever smelled.  The ending is surreal, and a wicked surprise.  Bravo!

2938738,2,B000TBG98M,"I was eager to see another film directed by Tykwer since Run Lola Run is one of my all-time favourite films. This film has many great points: the cinematography is stunning in showing both squalor and beauty, the premise is an interesting one, and the supporting characters played by Hoffman and Rickman were spirited. However, despite these elements, the film was remarkably unmoving. It is diffucult to convey scent through images, and though the visuals were vibrant, enlivening scent through a non-olfactory medium is better done with words and a reader's imagination (I hear the book is great for this) rather than through pictures. (Scent directly and chemically affects the brain, but watching TV/movies puts our brains in a lull, sometimes deeper than sleep, so the medium works against its goal.) Ben Whishaw (playing Grenouille, ""Frog"" in English), though very handsome, does little to carry the main role; his range of emotions (though lauded by the director and producer in the speacial features bit) goes from bland to slighly blander. Since we are following HIS story, I'd like to feel more about him, whether admiration, disgust, empathy or hatred. But I feel nothing.

In addition, the ending leaves a lot to be desired (spoiler coming). Everyone swooning and getting into scent-induced orgies over this ""dead-girl"" perfume? When did magical realism waltz its way into the film? That leap made me go from kind of liking the movie to really disliking it. If the audience is to suspend belief (when ""magic"" or supernatural wonders appear), this must be introduced earlier in the film. Otherwise it's like seeing a a war flick where a unicorn carries off a soldier in danger. Whishaw's character kills twelve or thirteen innocent women, so I wanted to see a just punishment for him. Having him essentially take his own life, not out of remorse but rather because he could never ""love or be loved like another human being"" makes me feel unsettled and cheated. LAck of love and depth of feeling is a sensible reason to kill oneself, but where does this angst come from? We only see one other scene hinting at him discovering an inner void (when he discovers he has no scent), but his discovery makes him want to show the world that he is special and important through his work, *not* making him want to become whole, emotionally fulfilled human. If he's to kill himself because he's vacant inside, we need to see more of him feeling his emptiness. All during the film he seems content to find comfort and obsessive joy in his work. A narrator voiceover and a flashback to an imagined scene of tenderness with his first murder victim is a sloppy, slap-dash way of showing this motivation.

In all, I think this movie has a great beginning, but the last fifteen or twenty minutes completely spoil the film.",1191628800,,2815,4.8625
2938739,5,B000TBG98M,"Even after reading the book, Perfume is the kind of a movie that can still shock and send chills down the spine. The story of a man born with no scent of his own but on a constant hunt for something that he can capture and anoint with to fit in is magnetic. I have never heard of a more interesting take on the world of scent mixed in with murder.

Ben Whishaw  as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was enigmatic, quiet, spooky, passionate and evil. I traveled though a flurry of emotions for him and his victims, knowing that his quest was very interesting yet it left a trail of despair and broken hearts of those who lost their loved ones. Death in the name of beauty if not a new phenomenon but it certainly is twisted when someone else has to pay the price. Alan Rickman, who also  plays Snape in Harry Potter movies, brings his uniqueness into the tale. The timber of his voice fits perfectly with the whole ethereal feel of the movie. His ruby haired daughter played by Rachel Hurd-Wood is Laura, the final ingredient on Grenouille's list to a heavenly scent.

18th century France comes alive in this fantastic movie. I have never seen so much filth, dirt and grease in any costume movie but it was all worth it, and I swear my senses of smell were heightened for hours after watching it. The extremely long list of makeup artists at the end credits confirmed my suspicion that this was done with meticulous care to breath more life into the story.  The soundtrack is marvelous, the scenery breathtaking and everything simply tingles with richness. This movie is enigmatic, there's not question about it but I enjoyed the subtlety and the shocks it caused, unless you jump and sweat what good was wasting all that time watching TV?

2938741,4,B000TBG98M,"Director Tom Tykwer decided to take on a project many directors previously rejected for considering it `unfilmable', with `Run Lola run' as a reference he started to work on this project. The result? An excellent adaptation that makes the experience of watching this film feel almost like reading the book.

Based on the novel by Patrick Suskind, `Perfume' tells the story of a singular character born with an enhanced sense of smell that enables him to identify and separate all smells he can detect. The character seems also to be cursed as everyone related to him ends up badly. When he gets obsessed with the smell of a virgin he then looks to learn how to capture the essence of things so he can obtain the smells he wants to create the ultimate perfume.

The story in the movie is guided by a narrator (John Hurt) and has most of the story arcs from the novel; some details were removed but they aren't really to be missed, in the novel for example, Grenouille creates a perfume with the smell of human that is not shown in the film. From beginning to end the adaptation is incredibly accurate, but even though the ending is exactly the same as the one in the book (even the same lines), the ending didn't feel quite well to me in the movie, I remember it having a deeper effect on me when I read it.

The style Tykwer uses to show the smell of things in interesting and in the same format of effects used in `Run Lola run', the music fits well with the movie as it uses haunting themes that complement the visuals to create a dark mood for the film.

Other than a 30 minutes documentary of the making of the film, there are no special features. The movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 and 2.0 surround and English/French/Spanish subtitles. The lack of extras really don't compensate for the price, you can get the movie for a cheaper price in the amazon market place instead. This detail explains the star I took from the review.

If you read the novel you definitely want to see the film as the people involved in the making made a great job adapting it to the cinema. If you haven't you don't really need to read the novel first unless you'd like to compare details.",1190592000,,2198,4.45771144278607

To begin, there is very little dialogue. Instead the majority of the film is expressed visually and physically.  There is a narrator who gives insight into the main character's thoughts.  Visually it is unique. Often beautiful, sometimes disgusting, always magnificent.  The story spans the genres of drama, horror, suspense, fantasy, and period film. It's kind of like a twisted fairy tale. I gave it four stars because I think the ending seems slapped together, like the filmakers were trying desperatley to give our madman main character some redeeming quality at the last minute.  Up until that point, he is a creepy, obsessed, and insane serial killer with a one-track mind, and there is nothing in the movie to make you feel differently. Then in the last five minutes they throw this ""He did it all for love"" twist at you, but it's too little, too late. The BIG orgy scene is done in a way that is not profane, and in the end it has meaning and purpose. The scene is really about love and connection, not so much about sex, which helps you get over any strange feeling about watching it.  All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind and likes to escape to a different world.

Rejected by his mother, who left him to die, he ends up in an orphanage where he has to endure abuse from his peers. When he is old enough he is sold as a slave to a tannery, but his willpower kept him afloat. That was not his only strength though, since Grenouille had a marvelous gift: his supernatural sense of smell.

While working at the tannery he discovers a couple of things that will change his life: a perfume shop, and even more relevant, a woman with a magnificent scent. The latter generates an urge that has to be satisfied, so Jean-Baptiste follows the girl and ends up smothering and killing her. The problem is that after death the scent disappears. So now he has to find a way to preserve the object of his obsession, and his journey begins with the perfumer Baldini (Dustin Hoffman). Baldini has had his era of glory but he has been eclipsed by the brilliance of his competitor Pelissier. Grenouille and his unnatural ability seem to be the answer to all his prayers, or maybe not.

Part of the reason why the adaptation of this novel works so well is the amazing performance of Ben Whishaw, who convincingly portrays the perturbed and immoral Grenouille. Whishaw is able to give this character a combination of obsession with his quest and nonchalance regarding the actions needed to achieve his goals. These are the things that make the main character of this story so complex and mesmerizing in the book. The supporting cast does not lag far behind, with a Dustin Hoffman that plays his role accurately and efficiently, and a Alan Rickman that infuses his character with the necessary emotion and desperation to make it believable. I recommend this movie without reservations, and if you have not read the book I urge you to do that too, since both experiences are highly enjoyable.",1189987200,,2807,5.20575221238938
2938745,1,B000TBG98M,"The book was fabulous.  The film adaptation is horrid.  Where to begin?  Dustin Hoffman is a fine actor, but nothing of his ability and screen power come thru in this film.  Ben Whishaw?  Forget it.  His performance is bland and boring, his performance lacking any emotion or inspiration.  You simply don't care about him as a character.  In fact, that is the primary fault of the entire film.  Character development is so poor that you simply don't care what happens to anyone in the film.

Alan Rickman, as usual, delivers a strong screen presence, but his role is so small that he cannot possibly save the film.  John Hurt with his characteristic voice also does a fine job of narrating the film.

Perfume is an excellent novel - a unique, well-developed story.  Definitely read the book!  But the film is a real stinker (pun intended).",1189209600,,839,4.696551724137931
2938746,2,B000TBG98M,"And again, everyone loves the emperor's clothes and how pretty all the colors are. Dustin Hoffman's career is circling down the drain much in the same manner that Robert De Niro's is, by showing up in films like this that are so utterly undeserving of his talent. If this is esteemed as a work of vision and depth, then the fix is truly in and the moviegoing public has been broken on the wheel of mediocrity- happily ingesting any substandard, contemptible feed Hollywood wishes to slop into the entertainment trough. Just because someone can recreate the streets of Paris or can CGI color a few fruits and hairdos to convey beauty and richness of experience doesn't mean that we should all clap and be awestruck. This movie is meaningless and unbelievable, a mockery of the period piece, the detective thriller, the psychosexual drama, the tortured genius expose, or any other genre it unintentionally parodies.

In politics, some say we get the government we deserve. By heaping praise on hollow window dressing like ""Perfume"", it looks like we will all continue to get the movies we deserve. Giving further life to this box office bomb via rentals or DVD sales is simply irresponsible. I bet the author of the book had to be restrained from going into the lot when this was filming, hoping he could find the screenwriter and sock him(and I say 'him' because I'm having trouble with the idea that an intelligent woman would countenance abetting the creation of such mindless exploitation of the fairer sex) in the jaw.",1189209600,,1521,4.827586206896552
2938747,4,B000TBG98M,"Wow, this is really a bizarre story with an ending that probably will turn off 98 percent of viewers who stick with this two hours, 147-minute film. I'm not sure what to make of it, other than totally understanding if people are left unsatisfied after watching this movie. As I said, I'm not sure how to interpret it as I just finished it minutes ago. It leaves you almost stunned.

Rather than judging that finale or divulging it, let me just comment on the first two hours of the film, which I found utterly fascinating. If I wasn't such an admirer of photography, art and special-effects, I doubt I would have found the movie so appealing because the story is ""not for everyone."" However, thanks to stunning French city and countryside scenery, 18th century period and beautiful women it enhanced the story to me. Yet, regardless of the visual treats, the story was so unusual it still would have held my attention.

Ben Wishaw, who plays the lead character ""Jean-Baptist Grenouille, has a face that is perfect for this role. His emaciated body, which survived a brutal childhood existence from the moment he was born also makes his character all the more credible. The looks of shock and awe on this man's face throughout the picture also add to his believability. He was mesmerizing with his haunting expressions. Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman provide ""name"" actors the film but it's Wishaw's movie, all the way.

I can only recommend this movie to those who share similar interests in cinematography and who like a ""different"" story but there are so many things in here - especially the ending - that could offend so many people, I would be hesitant to recommend this to the general viewer.",1188950400,,1698,4.749152542372881
2938748,3,B000TBG98M,"Try as I might I could not think of a non punning title for this review but at least I stayed away from ""Scent of a Woman."" With that said I feel that Tom Tykwer has done an admirable job in bringing Patrick Suskind's unfilmable (to use Kubrick's words) novel to the screen.

The film follows Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), an outcast with an incredible sense of smell throught 18th Century Paris. Grenouille uses his gift in order to find recognition and possibly even love and acceptance from those around him. Unfortunately he does it in the wrong way, he becomes a serial killer obsessed with making the perfect perfume. This perfume being created from the distilled essence of virgins.

Along the way he is apprenticed to master perfumer Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman)who teaches him his craft and starts Grenouille on his macabre journey. There is also some fine acting on display from Alan Rickman as Richis the father of Grenouille's final victim.

This is a film that relies heavily on its production design (Uli Hanisch) and its cinematography (Franke Griebe) in order to make the viewer feel and smell the sights and sounds of a filthy urban sprawl that was 18th century Paris. The novel was deemed unfilmable because it was thought that no film could capture this feel. Tykwer did a very good job even if the film is a little overlong for its own good. While the plot may not stand up to close scrutiny it does provide an interesting few hours in the dark. Many have commented on the strange ending but I feel that the ending helps the film reach its ultimate resolution. All said maybe the recognition that we seek is not what is in our best interests after all.

This is a provacative and intelligent horror film that many missed on its theatrical release. Give it a try. You may be glad you did for the acting and design alone.",1188864000,,1854,4.660550458715596

I was immediately swept-up in the grandeur of the film. Perfume is beautifully filmed, with the rich textures and imagery not often found since the days of the Italian filmmakers such as Felini, Visconti and Zefferelli.

The story and plotline become more of a parable as the story unfolds, and this will confuse the casual viewer as some of the other reviews have shown. The ending is a perfect conclusion to a ""Brothers Grimm Fairy Tale"" of one's need to exist and have self worth. The performance of Dustin Hoffman is simply outstanding, one of his best in recent memory. Allan Rickman is excellent also. The young Britisher, Ben Whishaw has found his defining role, and this will establish him in American's eyes.

The opening screen (Grenouille's birth) is splendid and as repulsive as I remember the book to be. The cast is first class. Ben Whishaw, to some, may come across as somewhat bland. Actually, he is playing the character exactly how the author intended: enigmatic, creepy, and missing more than just his personal scent. Whishaw is more attractive than the Grenouille I imagined. I expected short, stocky and ugly. Rickman, Hurd-Wood, and Hoffman are excellent and will not disappoint. The story is marvelous: a blend of realism, fantasy, and allegory.

2938757,4,B000TBG98M,"Tom Tykwer's ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is a stunningly beautiful and terrifyingly dark piece of film-making, as was the original Patrick Suskind novel in its realm of literature.  Like many fables and fairy tales, it tells us that nothing but the real thing can truly satisfy the soul which craves love.  As the story of a person cursed by a unique fate, it plays out like a Greek tragedy.  It echoes our news media in showing how social ills can create a human monster.

Since this tale is realistically depicted and set in 18th-century France, some viewers find the startling final scenes unbelievable as well as unacceptable.  However, the ending's premise is not only foreshadowed, but is actually scientifically based:  the limbic system, which is the emotional core of the modern human brain, is known to have developed from the olfactory region of the early mammalian brain.*  Odors, therefore, can still bypass the conscious level of our brain's activity, and directly affect our emotional state without our even being aware of it.

The disturbing images of ""Perfume"" are definitely not for children, nor for the faint of heart.  Our fascination for its brilliantly-gifted, but emotionally- and socially-stunted anti-hero makes us very uncomfortable, even though the dreadful deprivation and abuse he has suffered awaken our sympathy.  Many mainstream American moviegoers recoil from the on-screen images of final plot elements which were experienced by readers as less graphic in writing.  Thus, while the book was an international best-seller, and the movie was a hit in Europe, it did not do well at the US box office.  Nonetheless, in my opinion (and that of Roger Ebert--see his web site), it is a must-see for most film afficionados.

*""With the arrival of night-active mammals 180 m.y.a. [million years ago], smell replaced sight as the dominant sense, and a newer, more flexible way of responding--based on emotions and emotional memory--arose from the olfactory sense. In the Jurassic period, the mammalian brain invested heavily in aroma circuits designed to succeed at night as reptiles slept. These odor pathways gradually formed the neural blueprint for what was later to become our limbic brain.""

2938759,5,B000TBG98M,"German director Tom Tykwer, of ""Run Lola Run"" fame, should be commended for his outstanding adaptation of Patrick Suskind's novel ""Das Parfum"". Tykwer uses a series of authentic looking historical sets and impressive cinematographic close ups and zooms to depict Europe's largest city in the 1700's, Paris.  He uses his camera to convey the sense of aroma in the squalid, unhygienic metropolis which is essential to the plot.

Born into the lowest rungs of society and immediately abandoned by his uncaring mother Jean Baptiste Grenouille, the anti-hero of ""Perfume"", must overcome long odds to survive the pitiful life of an orphan.  The grown up Grenouille played admirably by Ben Whishaw from the onset of life had been endowed with the most highly developed sense of olfaction.  He gets a chance to prove and enhance his gift under the tutelage of once renowned Parisian perfumer Giuseppe Baldini played by a heavily made up Dustin Hoffman.

Obsessed with the art of perfuming, Grenouille at the insistence of Baldini treks to the city of Grasse to add to his skills.  A dark side of his personality reveals itself as he maniacally attempts to capture the ultimate scent.  He begins murdering attractive young women, and using the art of effluence uses their hair and bodily oils and scents to create a fragrance from each unfortunate victim.  His murderous actions cause a panic in the town and across the countryside.  Local beauty Laura played by Rachel Hurd-Wood and sheltered by her father played by Alan Rickman becomes Grenouille's ultimate target as the final ingredient in his perfect concoction.

The finale was a bit of a stretch but overall the film which was a box office failure, was totally engrossing as the mellifluous tones of narrator John Hurt and the wonderful sets and costumes guide us through a satisfying viewing experience.",1187395200,,1853,5.045901639344263

He is deprived in every way except in his ability to experience pleasure in cataloguing smells of the world around him.  Ben Whishaw is fantastic in portraying this character with all his depravity for motherly love, decent upbringing and childhood, desire to survive harsh life at any costs while bringing misfortune to all his encounters along the way - starting with his own mother from the day of his birth, perfume master who teaches him a trade and yound women, whose ethernal essence his tries so desperately to preserve.  Is this story about the man with a special gift, or a story of love that is destructive in all its beauty; is it a story of one's purpose and all the emotional numbness that comes from need to experience love and obtain one's own essence in this world- no matter what the cost?  The character of this movie is so intense, in his own way - he is greater than life itself in spite of the fact that the only way he can express himself is thru creation of the ethernal (love) perfume that disarms all around him.  This poor soul is not seeking riches, or fame, or power -- all he wants is to experience love and beauty he has never had.

And now, having seen it, I have to admit that I'm still not 100% sure how I feel about the thing.  It's just . . . so strange.

Good things first: I found the imagery in the film to be quite arresting.  The colors were lush and vibrant, really bounding off the screen at you.  And the art direction was superb.  As other reviewers have attested, you really can almost *smell* this movie.  It's one of the few period pieces I've seen where everyone looks appropriately dirty, as if they could use a nice soapy shower.  I enjoyed the narration and all of the performances.  Alan Rickman was especially marvelous, and the main character, played by Ben Whishaw (an actor apparently more famous for the stage than anything else . . . for now) was perfectly cast.  He was creepy, yet somehow strangely alluring. In spite of myself, I managed to build up some empathy for him, though he is one of the creepiest film characters I've ever seen.

The drawbacks of the movie are not necessarily drawbacks.  They just come so far out of left field that it's difficult to really step back and judge them at this point, when I am still recovering from shock.  Let's just say that *SPOILER ALERT!!* I've never seen a movie that contains both a massive orgy AND cannibalism.  Who'da thunk it?  There are also several things in the movie that are not really explained and don't make a whole lot of sense, such as the glowing light that emanates from a room after a key murder, and the trail of death the lead character (inadvertently?) leaves behind him.

On the whole, this movie should be seen, if only to be believed.  One of the people I was watching with left for nearly an hour to take a phone call, and when she came back and we told her what she'd missed, she was dubious, to say the least.  It's definitely something you have to stick with, despite its often bizarre and intensely creepy twists.  I settled on four stars because overall, I DID like the movie . . .

This concept is so picture perfect one would expect Valmont to walk into the perfumarie, as well as characters from all the recent period movies as well as Mozart or at least Salieri [snooping for ungents].

*Hoffman is delightful as the eccentric master perfumer living in his 'lively' little maison on the bridge - fairietailish in concept vs. Alan Rickman's chateau on Grasse [which brings new meaning to the hidden dangers of a maze  .... or a contemporary mall .... during rush hour .... or a crowded birthday party ...]

Tom Twyker shot this beautifully, with amazing shots and scenery, without too much pizzazz or speed which we saw in Run Lola Run, since as a life story it had to be told as a story of someone's life, which shouldn't be rushed. I was enthralled on how he captured the essence of smell in each shot, and actually made you think that each smell and each breath had a distinct feeling.

What really amazed me was when I found out that Twyker actually composed the music to this movie. He actually wrote the music and played it while they were shooting, and this really captured a specific mood and feeling for each scene - I know how hard it is to direct, but to write the music as well? Seriously.

All in all it was a great experience from front to back. Dustin Hoffman was a bad casting choice - in my opinion he sucked ever since he participated in the heretical ""The Messenger"", but other than that, it was a solid, great movie, shot masterfully by Twyker, of whom I am now a huge fan.

Im not a completely 100 percent practical kind of person. I love romanticism, mythology, and anything whimsical, insightful and deep. But even so, I must say...What the hell is going on here exactly???

Throughout most of the movie, I harbored feelings of sorrow and understanding for this boy, turned teen, turned man, who knew only what seemed to be pure misery in his life. He was lonely to the extreme. He was unintentionally, destructively breaking down his mentality by his way of thinking and perception. And as demented as it sounds, I even went as far as to completely understanding why he would do something like what he did. I could relate to alot of the sadness and means of wanting, and hoping for, in his life.

It was very different, and I really started liking the movie itself, and the idea of digging into the core of this misunderstood madman, yet  coldhearted jaded ruthless killer, who didn't know what love was, but wanted to be loved by a world that didn't love him.

But wait, I didn't finish.

When it started drawing near the conclusion, I was apologizing to my mom for making her rent it, and we were both quite completely lost.

Alright. Jean Baptise is sentenced to crucifixtion. Understandable. He comes out to face his death sentence, waves his little white napkin (with the scent of his perfume) around, and everyone in this city falls to their feet, calls him "" the angel"" and claims that he is ""innocent"" after killing alot of very innocent girls. The whole town has an orgy around him while he is contemplating his thoughts on a platform in the middle of them. Huh?

Wow. From there it was beginning to look like a horny college guy's dream. It wasn't even remotely realistic at all. I mean what the hell? Could you have atleast provided alternative endings, where one ending makes sense, instead of having only one that doesn't at all? A murderer is NOT going to be getting out of a scheduled crucifixation because he has invented the perfect smell. Hundreds of middle aged people are not going to have sex out in public around him because he smells good or even perfect. I cannot even fathom that. Nobody alive is that forgiving....No family of a deceased person would say, ""Oh yeah, don't worry about our daughter. She died for a good cause. Just let me have a whiff of that concoction and we'll call it even.""

At the end, everything was so exaggerated.

Meanawhile, One high class father, of one of the girls Jean Baptiste kills, falls to his knees and out of the blue calls Jean his son... Because he smells good? I don't know. Mr Jean Baptiste seems to have the ability to control the world with this perfume. Does it explain further? No. Does it show said high class father anymore? No. Does it show high class father and Jean hugging in delighted glee to give audience clues to understanding if they are really father and son? No.

Wait, wait thats NOT EVEN the most nonsensical part. Nope.

Jean travels back to the place he was born while another guy gets convicted and hung for something he did not do. When Jean gets to his hometown, he  pours the perfume all over his head and gets devoured (as in eaten) in front of my eyes (I'm about 95 percent sure that it was cannibalistically) by his fellow neighbors.

Then it fades out to black and credits come on. Hmm.

Big Question mark.

Ive tried to think of ways that this whole story would come together under these circumstances, but I cant. Nothing makes sense.

It was so disappointing. Started off so good, then PLOP... we are off in a weird, demented, version of a bad and confused Alice in Wonderland, 18th century France setting, on crack.

I am personally wondering how this movie got so many good ratings. Perhaps nobody bothered to see the end.",1186444800,,3788,4.611607142857143
2938769,4,B000TBG98M,"""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is one of those films that begins pretty much at the start of the end.  Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is beaten and dragged from his prison cell to hear the sentence of the court, which seems to have a viciousness usually reserved for regicides.  This beginning makes it clear that the murderer whose story this is will be caught.  Such a statement is true, but it is also inaccurate when it comes to capturing the nature of this 2006 film directed by Tom Tykwer (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heaven/dp/B00005JKN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heaven</a>"") based on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/0375725849/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel</a>&nbsp;by Patrick S&uuml;skind.  Ultimately, I found myself thinking that this story is a fable.

The history of perfume begins in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, with the name of a perfume maker appearing on a second millennium cuneiform tablet.  In the 18th century France became the center of the European perfume trade when aromatic plants grown in the Grasse region provided the raw materials for the flourishing industry.  However, S&uuml;skind's novel finds the motivation for perfume in the muck and mire that was the streets of Paris three centuries ago and even without the use of scratch-and-sniff stickers Tykwer's movie gives a sense that the city is one giant cesspool where perfumes are a necessary way of covering the smells.  Grenouille is literally born in the muck and manages to survive, growing up to evince two remarkable traits: Not only does he posses the most acute sense of smell on the planet but also has absolutely no scent of his own.

Grenouille's unique talent leads to a peculiar obsession when he encounters two people.  One is a girl (Karoline Herfurth) who sells plums on those streets of Paris and the other is Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), a master perfumer who has fallen out of favor and now resorts to trying to copy the successful perfumes of his competitors.  Grenouille wants to preserve the smell of the plum girl and it is in the service of that obsession that he becomes a murderer.  Baldini agrees to mentor the young tanner in exchange for marvelous new perfumes, but the old master does not have the secret that drives Grenouille and in parting Baldini tells the young man to head to Grasse, the center of the world for the art of perfuming.  However, once there what catches Grenouille's attention are not the plants of the region but the young women of Grasse, especially the beautiful Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood), daughter of Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman), a wealthy and well-respected citizen of the town.

John Hurt's narration is a major part of the film since Grenouille is a man of very few words who spends most of his time sniffing the air and inhaling deeply the scents that catch his attention.  The narration is also needed to ensure the audience catches the attendant ironies of the story's conclusion.  It is Hurt's tone as much as his words that confirm my idea that this story is a fable.  Except for the layers of irony at the end I might be tempted to call ""Perfume"" a parable, but the uniqueness of both Grenouille's character and his story are such that it cannot be extrapolated to the audience in any meaningful way.  There is no catharsis to be found here and none is intended, but ""Perfume"" is very much in the tradition of the tragic heroes of ancient Greece where the Fates often dictated an ironic demise.  As such, it will not be to everybody's taste, but then that is not the primary sense at play in this partiucular tale.",1186444800,,3673,5.101836393989983

I detested Pan's Labyrinth and, try as I might, I could not understand the fascination others seemed to have with it and this disturbed me.  I find myself being equally, if not MORE, disturbed that I found Perfume so engrossing.  The beginning which details Grenouille's birth is totally nauseating--the sights are unbearably nasty and sickening, especially the newborn amid the dead fish and maggots and the adult projectile vomiting against the wall, with just a glimpse of the dog that you know is going to devour the vomit.  That said, it is still mezmerizing and morbidly, very morbidly fascinating.  the hero or villan, however you see him, is totally without feeling.

2938771,5,B000TBG98M,"""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" (2006) is directed by Tom Tykwer (Lola rennt (1998), Der Krieger und die Kaiserin (2000), and Heaven (2002)) and based on the bestselling novel by Patrick Susskind which is one of the most amazing debuts in the world literature. The novel was written in 1985 and has been translated into 45 languages, so far selling more than 15 million copies worldwide, making it the most successful novel of post-war German literature. Having been known as un-filmable, the novel presented the ultimate challenge for any director who would decide to adapt it the screen. How is it possible to transfer to the screen the myriads of odors that practically crawl and jump from every sentence of each page to envelop and to overwhelm the readers?...

""Perfume"" tells the story of Jean-Baptist Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) a young man, who was born in Paris fish market in 1738 and was not supposed to live at all just like his four siblings that had been killed by their mother minutes after they were born but who survived and brought to the world with him double curse of not having any smell of his own and to be able to recognize, memorize, and later to capture every odor existed (or was that a blessing?). He grew up to become obsessed by the idea of creating the perfect perfume, the one that would capture the fragrance of love, devotion, and desire. To create the perfume like that, he would need the ingredients that could only be obtained by capturing essence of the unique scent, an indelible part of the young, beautiful, and innocent women that effortlessly evoke love, admiration, tenderness, and desire in everyone who'd approach them. Not even a human being but rather a creature for whom there is no word to describe, the monster with the divine sense of smile, the depository of myriads of odors, the evil genius obsessed by the perfection and beauty that he never was able to approach and to possess, Jean-Baptist Grenouille would stop to nothing to reach his terrifying and fascinating goal.

I believe that Tom Tykwer made an astounding film that is perfect with the exception of a short scene few minutes before the film was over. Tykwer decided to make his anti-hero sympathetic - just for a couple of minutes and it was a wrong decision that goes against the character's logic, against everything we've learned about Jean-Baptist Grenouille. Other than that, I found the movie outstanding in all departments. It is the true Ode to Olfaction where the sense of smell was presented by the incredible, fantastic images combined with the music written by director himself and adding marvelously to the strange, dark, disturbing, and sensual world of mystery, murders, beauty, and obsession. The film director recreated the 18th century France beautifully by shooting the Paris scenes in Barcelona, Spain, and the ones that take place in Grasse, the capital of French perfumers, in Figueres, Spain, the city of Salvador Dali. Just like the novel, the film presents rather pessimistic and un-flattering outlook at the mankind and in this regard, the final two scenes are absolutely brilliant in their morbid irony.",1186358400,,3147,4.913533834586466
2938772,5,B000TBG98M,"The sense of smell has never be so compelling and so wonderfully put on film then it has in ""Perfume - Story of a Murderer"".

The movie takes place in Paris 300 years ago and tells the story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, played by Ben Whishaw, who is an orphan with the best sense of smell in the world.

Jean's goal in life is to make a perfume that captures the esseance of smell and never goes faint, a perfume so potent that people loose track of all reality.  Jean's life gets twisted and darkened has he looks and searches for the sents needed to complet is masterpice and what's portrayed is a man's spiral in a hateful but unknowing place.

Perfume wraps yourself with its world and its personlity so effectivley, that the ending will slap you in the face.  The preformaces of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille by Ben Whishaw is a wonder to watch...you see a little Hannibl Lector in him.

2938773,4,B000TBG98M,"PERFUME - THE STORY OF A MURDERER may not succeed on every level. Based on the novel DAS PERFUM by Patrick Sskind and prepared for the screen by Andrew Birkin, Bernd Eichinger, and director Tom Tykwer, this is a story more about the senses than about people.  The main character is not the sort of man with whom we can identify, but the progress of this crazed youth into the olfactory madness of serial killing for the sake of creating perfumes does provide an opportunity to study life in the 18th century in a way seldom available for viewers.  It is clumsy in spots, protracted in length, and a bit tedious in the telling, but visually this is a movie that is a feast (?) for the eyes.

Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Wishaw) is born in poverty and while he is thought to be stillborn, he survives and is found to have an extraordinary sense of smell. His youth is spent in work houses and slavery until one famous Italian perfumer Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), living in Paris, discovers Grenouille's gifts and takes him on as an apprentice.  The lad learns the technique of vaporizing and boiling essences but when he asks Baldini how to capture the smell of 'anything at all' (particularly the scent of women), Baldini sends him off to study the technique of 'enfleurage', a manner of embedding flowers in fat until their essences are absorbed yield a pure form in the distillation of the melted fat.  Grenouille begins to capture women to coat them in fat to obtain their scent and in doing so he begins his cycle of murders of the victims.  When he encounters the lass Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) who would steal his attention, her father Richis (Alan Rickman) finally puts and ending to the macabre tale of Perfume.

In many ways, though the cast performs well, the star of the production is the cinematography by Frank Griebe and the accompanying musical score by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek, and (yes) Tom Tykwer. At 147 minutes the movie is too long for the story, but the setting and moods created are well worth watching. Grady Harp, August 07",1186099200,,2060,4.6740331491712706
2938774,4,B000TBG98M,"The long slo-mos and wide shots are not always necessary.  But it is a fascinating, disturbing and certainly original story.  You can practically detect the scents as the murderer learns the art of perfume-making from a master, and as the former breathes in the fragrance of the young women he ends up killing in a desire to capture their unique scents forever.
  I don't think I would have cast Hoffman in the role of Baldini--his accent was too slippery and he didn't look quite right in the role.  But the others fared far better.
I am now curious to read the novel.",1185840000,,569,4.53921568627451
2938775,5,B000TBG98M,"I liked the movie.
I appreciate the rather uniform high quality of the amazon reviews, it tells me that the movie stimulates people to think about the issues and consider what the authors present.
But i'm left with several lingering problems about what was going on.
Perhaps these things were settled in the novel and only hinted at in the movie, i don't know.

Like any good piece of literature there are several threads interwoven.
The first is about obsession and talent. Here the movie reminds of Amadeus, just a different sense-this with smell and Amadeus with sound.
For Amadeus was about talent, like this movie what happens when talent is submerged in life and suppressed and not recognized for the rarity and genius that it is.
The main character, Frog (apparently one translation of his name and a striking description of the character and his walk as well), never has a chance. Despite being an olafactory genius, he is trapped in a time and place that only offers his talent meager usage. That is one of the questions i had, this main theme just gets dropped after the climax of the naked bodies in the square, he literally loses the obsession and the drive, i don't know why.

As his uniquely talented nose is discovering the world and trying to find an outlet (which it eventually does with Dustin Hoffman's character, the failed Italian perfumer). The second theme begins to emerge, on top of the obsession is something about the essential things, the essence of being, the smell that characterizes. At first it looks like the author is talking about the soul, the thing that makes a woman a woman, a piece of steel-steel etc. but i am not sure. It looks as if this characteristic, this smell that he detects is the essence of being a woman, maybe love, maybe joy in living, maybe even pheromones of attraction and sensual passion. This is the whole thread about creating the perfect perfume from the distilled essence of the 12 (or is it 13?) beautiful, attractive, young women. It doesn't appear to be about sex, despite the orgy at the end where the townsfolk get a whiff of the finished product. Perhaps there is a hint in the three kinds of scents used in perfumes, one for immediate, one for intermediate, one for long term. In the long term, the townspeople were apparently embarrassed and ashamed, in the short term they were passionate and lustful. In any case, the perfume is about synergy, how the essence of these women together create the perfect perfume.

Another major theme is about love and caring. The first half basically hasn't any love in it at all, the later half has the relationship of the father and daughter and them to the dead but not forgotten mother and wife. The Frog has no love or concern for anyone, his first murder is just circumstantial, an accident. The others are planned, calculating and cold blooded, none even with any passion or lust despite the hair shorn and naked bodies of the young victims. His only passion comes in a brief, what if vision he sees when he opens and uses the perfume in the town square. It's not as much regret for their deaths as a missed opportunity to smell them more intimately. But another thing that puzzles me is that the universe, that fate seems to follow him and tidy things up, everyone that passes him along, from birth mother, to orphanage exploiter, to perfumer, to 2nd perfumer, died comically tragic deaths soon after he moves on. It is as if the universe is balancing out the very rotten hand he was dealt, by dealing death to those that exploit him. But why? Because they didn't recognize and further the talented nose? No, it is more like cleaning house or tying up lose ends. Again, i'm not sure what the author is trying to tell us here.

Even with these 3 themes doing a complex waltz on screen, the movie is a riot of color and proposed smells for us, the audience. Since our theaters don't have aerosols that bring specific smells to our minds, the smells are provoked by some extraordinarily good movie making. I for one can smell the sewers of later 16 or early 16thC Paris, i've been in Chinese fish markets and suspect that they smelled pretty much how the world into which he was thrust so unceremoniously did back then. This crossover of visual and olfactory senses is a treat, movies seldom work much on our sense of smell. Again the alignment with Amadeus pops up, just another sense. There is this nice crossover between sense and sensually, for smell is a key sense in sex and lust, something that the movie uses to heighten and strength the impact.

It's an interesting movie, i'm glad i ran across it.",1185753600,,4617,4.625609756097561
2938776,5,B000TBG98M,"`Perfume' released in '07 is one of the most absorbing, unpredictable, titillating, genre free films I've ever seen.

If that weren't enough, it's also a parody, allegory, fable and parable. I guess the bottom line is it leaves the audience with so many unanswered questions and possibilities you can make of it whatever you wish.

The movie will simultaneously surprise, disturb, repel and fascinate the viewer as it moves upside down and back again on a dizzying rollercoaster journey through the visceral world of odors and scents that defined 18th century France. This film has it all, mesmerizing cinematography, haunting soundtrack, superior cast and an extremely unique storyline that will keep you wondering where it's all headed until the shocking end.

2938778,5,B000TBG98M,"I could almost smell everything portrayed in the film from the nasty fish market to the stones, metal and rocks. Each image made me conjure in my mind the smell. What a completely original film. The main character made me feel sympathy and hate him at the same time. Rickman was outstanding portraying the feelings of a protective father demonstrating a love for his daughter that was painful to watch because he is so worried about what will happen to her. He did a wonderful job capturing the protectiveness, vulnerability, and strength of a loving father. The main actor, playing Henri, was outstanding.
I was surprised to see Dustin Hoffman as the italian perfumer. His accent was really bad and he kept pulling me out of the movie to Dustin Hoffman the way he'd go in and out of accent. His voice was distracting. Other than that he was good portraying the has-been perfumer, silly and desperate at the same time.
What a beautiful unique bit of film art. Not enough artistry is scene in film today, it's mostly about making millions of megabucks. But this movie was something that had you riveted from the opening scene in the fish market. Weird, but so well done, appreciated for its weirdness.  There was so much visual beauty.

2938779,4,B000TBG98M,"Some believed that the novel titled ""Das Parfum"", for which this movie is based, could not be adequately translated onto film with any kind of satisfactory result. How does one translate scent and aroma into visual imagery, and attempt to draw the audience in to the mind of a murderer while displaying his particular flair for the dramatic and sensual experience of smell? The obvious answer would be that it is quite difficult.

This film, however, pulls it off beautifully. Anyone who enjoys artistic film pieces would be able to appreciate ""Perfume - The Story of a Murderer"" for it's daring and visually stunning accomplishment. The tale of a young perfumer with an incredible sense of smell, who goes on to attempt to ""bottle"" the very essence of a woman (by murdering her in order to create his amazing perfumes) is a shocking mind trip, and ends up being quite disturbing, even while it is visually and cinematically beautiful.

The sounds heard throughout the film, and the images flickering across the screen are combined to give the audience a distinct smell they are meant to interpret. It takes a bit of imagination to try to translate your own thoughts and feelings into an olfactory experience (the world has not yet invented a good smell-o-vision theatre, but if it did I believe this film would be one of the first screened).

I enjoyed this film for it's artistic level, and it also doesn't hurt to be an Alan Rickman fan (who is mesmerizing in this movie, by the way). Anyone who enjoys period movies as well should be able to appreciate the story.

Bottom line, I enjoyed it, despite it's distinctly disturbing nature at times.

2938781,3,B000TBG98M,"A meritorious overall design and an intriguing beginning are promptly buried by exceptionally unconventional twists and a laughably bizarre conclusion in Tom Tykwer's Perfume: The Story of a Murderer. With undertones of Silence of the Lambs, and a beautifully haunting score, we're unfortunately forced to root for Buffalo Bill. Based on the perceivably unfilmable bestselling novel by Patrick Suskind, the world of scents and smell appear visually delightful; however it fails to be wholly entertaining.

In 18th century France, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Wishaw) is born to a nauseating fishmonger who promptly disposes of him in a pile of rotting fish carcasses and writhing maggots. She earns the noose for her troubles, and Grenouille is sent to grow up in the orphanage where he discovers his astounding ability to discern every kind of smell. He is sold to a vile tanner, and during a fortunate delivery happens upon Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), a dclass perfumer who quickly buys Grenouille when he discovers his skills for deciphering the ingredients used in a rival's perfume. When a chance encounter with a young girl leads him to obsess over the unobtainable scent of womanhood, he ignites a killing spree of several women in the city of Grasse, using their bodies to create the elusive aroma. Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman) must protect his daughter, the most enticing woman in Grasse, whom he knows might be the final ingredient in Grenouille's relentless and unimaginable plan.

Newcomer Ben Wishaw plays Grenouille with morbid yet enticing fervor, leading the viewer to anxiously wait for his next psychotic endeavor. Hoffman and Rickman also lend their acting expertise; Hoffman mainly for comic relief, and Rickman for much needed, stern normalcy. And normalcy is what Perfume so desperately lacked, as the twisted events abruptly spiraled to an unfathomable conclusion. So many pieces worked in favor of the film, but nothing could save it from its intangible plot. We follow the works of Grenouille much in the same way we root for the insidious Hannibal Lector, except that Perfume is unquestionably devoid of any Clarice Starling characters to which we can justifiably relate. As much as the film is visually stunning, the eccentricity is so overwhelming that by the unpredictable and sadly laughable conclusion, we're left with nothing to dwell on but those very atrocities. Culminating with a surprising display of sexual deviance, the magnificence and allure of the characters and settings are disbanded, resulting in disbelief and confusion. Crossing those boundaries of believability, even in a predominantly fantasy environment, and then subjecting audiences to little sense of retribution, leaves much to be desired from such an engrossing start. Curiously reminiscent of David Lynch, Shinya Tsukamoto and Alejandro Jodorowsky, director Tom Tykwer achieves few of their often satisfyingly macabre concoctions.

Perhaps the only truly redeeming aspect of the film is the captivating score with a recurring melodic theme that permeates the oftentimes grisly look of the filthy cities portrayed. The major settings, first Paris where Jean-Baptiste is born, and then Grasse where he journeys to discover the secrets of preserving scents, are brilliantly recreated in all their dismal glory. Elaborate costumes and striking imagery are lavishly produced, and the abundance of highly aromatic items nearly burst from the screen.

Fans of particularly deranged cinema might find this interesting fantasy palatable, but the majority of moviegoers will probably be paled by Perfume's deficient denouement and its lengthy two-and-a-half hour duration.

The movie follows a pragmatic and realistic account of conditions in 18th Century pre-revolutionary France.  The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, and his life dream of creating the perfect perfume, and on the other (and to a lesser extent), conditions leading to the French Revolution (1789).
The movie portrays superbly life in France, and provides valuable insight into a very important period of French (European) History.
We get a feel for the power and influence that the Catholic Church exerts during this time.
The film is also excellent in showing the Ancien Regime's methods of execution (Hanging and ""The Cross"") as opposed to the ""revolutionary"" guillotine used after 1789.
Ben Whishaw, Dustin Hoffman, Alan Rickman (!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows.

A savant of smell, Parisian-born orphan Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) grows up in the 18th-century school of hard knocks, yet is determined to become the greatest perfumer the world has ever known. As he stalks the evanescent aroma of a beautiful young redhead (Karoline Herfurth), his obsession turns to tragedy, setting him of a life-path of death and destruction.

Pros:
A visual feast that almost magically conjures the scents onscreen
A serial killer story steeped in a historically-heightened fairytale feel

Cons:
A little too much foreshadowing makes the movie drag here and there

Perfume is brilliantly cast, with great -- and sometimes delightfully over-the-top -- performances from silver screen stars like Dustin Hoffman (master perfumer), John Hurt (narrator), and Alan Rickman (the protective father of a would-be Grenouille victim). Ben Whishaw portrays a truly reprehensible, murderous character with no redeeming qualities, yet he imbues  Grenouille with a pitiable, sympathetic air reminiscent of Boris Karloff in Frankenstein.

It's very well-directed (if somewhat a tad too leisurely) by Run Lola Run's Tom Tykwer, and wonderfully wrought by everyone else from the set-designer, to the composer, to the flower-finder.

This is a difficult film to describe without spilling too many surprises, so all I can say is: take the time to stop smell the cinematic rose that is Perfume.

2938789,5,B000TBG98M,"How exactly do you make a movie about smells? After all, a movie is all about sight and sound. Touch, taste and smell rarely come into it.

But acclaimed German director Tom Tykwer manages to make us smell things, in his most disturbing movie to date, ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer."" This time around, the talented Tykwer abandons his usual lovers-against-the-world stories for a lushly-filmed, darkly comic story of olfactory obsession. Yes, that is what I said.

Jean-Baptiste Grenouillle (Ben Whishaw) is a man with a brilliant sense of smell, and zero body odor. He was born in a putrid fishmarket, raised in an orphanage, and later escapes from a tannery where he was working. He's enraptured by the many thrilling smells in the city -- he even kills a young girl, so that he can smell her lovely scent.

In his search for the perfect scent, Jean-Baptiste gets a job with a once-famed perfume-maker (Dustin Hoffman). But after learning that not everything has a scent, he begins killing women to try to distill their scents into the ultimate perfume -- with beautiful redhead Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) as the ""thirteenth scent."" But his ultimate scent has an even more sinister side, as his scents begin to affect the population in unusual ways.

""Perfume"" is Tykwer's most unique movie to date, and the one that definitely identifies him as a cinematic master. There are lots of music that are evocative, sensual, colourfully beautiful, or unspeakably creepy, but not many manage to be all of them. ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is all of those, and more.

Obviously a movie doesn't smell like anything, except maybe stale popcorn. So Tykwer uses sight for smell -- rotted fish, maggots, moldy walls from the late 1700s to show Jean-Baptiste's miserable origins. And he uses sparkling colour and windblown trees for nicer scents. Colour takes the place of scent itself -- bright red Lola hair on multiple girls, flowers that seem to pop out of the screen, fresh leaves, brilliant fruits, even brightly coloured food. It gives the visuals a fairy-tale vibrancy.

In fact, the scripting almost comes second to the exquisite cinematography. Yet Tykwer is able to bring across the powerful symbolism that brings the movie to life -- the smells are symbolic of love itself, which the scentless and amoral Jean-Baptiste does not have. He can only try to take it from others, with a finale that is the very image of poetic justice.

Jean-Baptiste himself is one of those love/hate characters, and Whishaw does an excellent job with his sort of half-crazy, intent stare. And there are some great supporting performances by Alan Rickman as Antoine Richis (Laura's dad) and Hoffman as the eccentric old perfume-maker -- he adds a welcome note of comedy.

A movie is dependent on sight, but Tom Tykwer creates a movie that you can almost smell. ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is darkly comic, bizarrely beautiful movie, and definitely worth seeing.",1179532800,,2955,4.93158953722334
2938790,4,B000TBG98M,"If you're looking for something unusual, unconventional and unpredictable, ""Perfume"" is your film. I am not saying this will give a pleasant smell to you. Probably some people would be attracted to the complexity of the strange world where olfactory perception means everything. Or some would loath the film's story and main character itself, especially the conclusion. Whatever you may find it, Tom Tykwer's ""Perfume"" remains intriguing throughout as allegorical tale, dark comedy or serial killer suspense. Pick your choice.

With John Hurt as narrator with slightly mocking tone, the eventful life story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is introduced, and from the very first moment you realize ""Perfume"" is no ordinary film. The film successfully conveys how Paris in the 18th century (at least one certain district) smelled really bad, with too realistic scene of its fish market, which is followed by the birth of Jean-Baptiste. His life is destined to be a different one, and the first chapter fully convinces us of his fate.

Ben Whishaw plays adult Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, and his wonderful acting as the (anti-)hero virtually carries the entire film to the last. Typical rags-to-riches drama is given a twist when other characters step in his life. First Jean-Baptiste is apprenticed to Giuseppe Baldini, second-rate perfumer who lost his skills. Dustin Hoffman's fake Italian accent may annoy you, but wait for what happens. Jean-Baptiste creates a ""hit"" perfume with his superb olfactory sense, making Baldini a rich person, and then ... see it for yourself. The story is not definitely Charles Dickens.

Beautiful Rachel Hurd-Wood and Alan Rickman are both memorable as aristocratic father and his only daughter. Tom Tykwer relies much on their acting talent to create the credible relations between them, which is I think still underwritten and not interesting enough. His skills as director are more effective in presenting Jean-Baptiste who can create the perfect scent in the most unique and terrifying fashion.

As to its conclusion - don't worry, this is spoiler-free - you will find it either fascinating or just awful. But maybe we shouldn't take the story too seriously for ""grenouille"" also means ""frog"" in French. ""Perfume"" defies easy explanations like real perfumes you smell every day. ""Perfume"" has that inexplicable quality that makes itself all the more attractive to us.",1176076800,,2398,5.319261213720317
2938791,2,B000TBG98M,"Who knew there could be such terror and mysticism surrounding the scent of a photogenic woman? Well, as Toucan Sam says, ""The nose knows."" And what the nose knows seems to be what the eyes know, except that what separates the killer in ""Perfume"" from an inbred madman of ""The Devil's Rejects"" ilk is that Jean-Baptiste doesn't rape his victims. This makes him merely misunderstood and lovelorn. So it's like ""Interview With a Vampire"" or the dracula movie with Keannu Reeves, DC's Sandman, ""The Crow,"" The Penguin, The Hunchback of Notre Dame -- just another tortured soul looking for a woman who can melt his frigid heart. I mean I like how women smell too but if I went around killing them to capture their scent, I wouldn't garner much sympathy and, not being a celebrity, I would probably even do some jail time. Somehow, up on the big screen, this sort of thing is considered ""romantic."" A 40-foot head uttering such things as, ""I can only tickle the ivories properly if the piano wire is fashioned from virgins' guts"" has a good chance of making a female theatergoer swoon as long as the maniac looks like a Calvin Klein model.

When it comes down to it, ""Perfume"" is little more than a Loreal commercial if directed by M. Night Shyamalan. You don't merely suspend your disbelief for this movie, you take it to court and slap it with a permanent injunction. Unless you buy the idea that a man on a platform can wave a hanky sprinkled with a perfume concoction so olfactorily appealing he gains complete control over the crowd below.

2938794,5,B000TBG98M,"The story setting is in the 18th century France yet the exact year did not mention in details. I assume it is in the late 18th century. (After the demise of Louis XV, France, on the verge of science revolution while bearing the King's luxurious Rococo deep debt, lived in a contradictory world (Rich & poor, chaos & order, Sir & servants, genius & freak, and blessing & curse.))

Grenouille, born in a stench of filthy market, has a gifted nose. Yet, his life is not so blessed with love that he was immediately abandoned by his mother. Year by year, he was obsessed with olfactory excitements, and his uniqueness naturally draws a line between he and the ordinaries. The devoid of his social incompetence is also a barrier to connect the humanity, and ironically such barrier seems common among genius or freaks?!

He was sold as a slave working in a tannery. One day, his foray to a city introduces his nostril to numerous enchanting smells with his eyes open, hunting the scent. Soon, it leads to a tragedy to his first victim, a red-haired virgin (red symbolizes passion and love in drama), and the others. Knowing being a perfumer would be able to preserve scents makes Grenouille's heart speeds up. He proves himself to recreate and to concoct the fragrance when opportunity favors him at Giuseppe Baldini's (Dustin Hoffman).
O~ A lung full of bliss, le parfum, imbues one's soul. Baldini is amazed by his power, and exploits him in exchanging sublime perfume formulae. (In 18th-century France, perfume is an opulent merchandise and brings a lucrative business.)

True beauty that lies within and radiates through body aura is what Grenouille seeks for his perfect perfume. Each woman he captured has a unique quality. He made a perfect perfume by using the essence of the women. Eventually, he was caught and yet escaped from headman's axe with his pheromonic perfect perfume which impulses men and women to perform a big orgy.
He could have used his perfect perfume to preserve his own olfactory fiefdom, but it would be a hollow victory for there's no love/soul left to him. How much he wishes he could be loved and be recognized. Without it, he has nothing to live for; at the end, he melts himself with his perfect perfume into those 12 women's destiny.

Grenouille, theatrically, wears no scent as if a stray ghost that doesn't exist nor is identified. The movie director reveals this secret in the middle of the movie, to which makes the protagonist not been immediately labeled as a freak as in the novel. The director would like his audiences to, imperceptibly, learn him better.
In a literary perspective, it is inexplicable to say Grenouille is a real murderer/killer because he doesn't really enjoy killing. Rather, his motive is using his inhumanly focus on scent, the sole meaning of himself, to preserve 12 virgins' pristine state. (A metaphor, a message of what he longs for.)

His character is more implicit than explicit. A metaphor which carries different meanings to different people. His character can be viewed as a message, a representative of one particular aspect of the feeling of love. Often mistaken for love itself, the hunger, the desperation, and the uncontrollable urge to surrender oneself is the most magical, as well as the most dangerous display among all symptoms of love. However, it is much like the composition of a cuisine dish: it can never have just one ingredient. Love needs a balance. Love encompasses understanding, compassion and a great level of tenderness.

This movie reveals the contradiction between extreme and balance. It's the extreme that drives everything forward (and backward sometimes) but without balance, even something as beautiful as love can turn into disasters.

2938795,5,B000TBG98M,"Mesmermerizing, often perplexing, and surreal, 'Pefume: The Story of a Murderer' is more than a keen study in the sense of smell.  It methodically wraps a story around key players that both transcend and embrace class and sensual experience.  What strikes me throughout this film is how different it is from other movie outings.

We start with a French baby who is born in Paris in the greatest of squalor.  His mother abandons him and lives him to rot on the streets.  She is caught and sent to the gallows, but his fate is to be sent to an orphanage where the children almost make a second attempt at the death penalty.  He's Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), and he soon discovers coming of age that he is different.  Not only is he a pariah, but he harbors a strong sense of smell that is only associated with animals.  It becomes clear that not only does it become his main sensory operandi to detect things and people, but, it is his last piece of dignity, so he lives his whole life wanting to preserve every smell he comes across on the planet.  Director Tom Tykwer makes every image stand out, so we can see, hear, and, well, almost smell, everything Jean-Baptiste does.  I felt my mind's filing cabinet filling in the blanks.  What they don't provide, we easily fill in the gaps, but what they do provide is an especially sensual visual and listening experience.  Much of 'Perfume...' is exquisite.  So if it is smell, like himself, he wishes to preserve, his highest pursuit will be for ""the scent of a woman"".  He can't rise above that in 18th century France until he comes upon a famed Italian perfumer living in Paris, Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman).  Delivering hides from a tannery not known for health benefits, Jean-Baptiste begs Baldini for a chance to work for him.  Here he can work on extra-curricular projects that will attempt to satisfy his olfactory palette for preserving every scent.  It's a tempestuous relationship at times, but it is Jean's portal to encountering wealthy women who wear the scents, like the one's Guiseppe is perveyor for.  In a tragic scene Jean-Baptiste encounters a woman, and, frightening her, he restrains her, so she won't cry out.  He is overly zealous and kills her inadvertently.

After that the lingering fragrance of the movie is to trace and bottle the scent of a woman.  There's a scene where a red-haired woman is cutting apricots in two.  It is hallmark.  I was expecting an overflow of sexuality, but what I got was sensuality that was effective like few films are.  The rest of the movie takes many turns; many of which I didn't expect.  I am still pondering the repurcussions of this film.  The only film I can think of that remotely reminds me of 'Perfume' is 'Chocolat'.  It is an odd and unique bird.  While I am satisfied with the lingering effects of 'Perfume,' it isn't all neat and tidy.  Perhaps that's what makes it so rare and special...The film I mean.",1169078400,,2938,4.6725146198830405

Perhaps this is why this film so amazed me. It is refreshing to see NEW material,and not some rehash of the same stuff over and over again.

2938797,3,B000TBG98M,"I loved Patrick Suskind's novel Perfume immensely; I still remember the impact the imaginative and macabre story had on me: an 18th-century French orphan, born without a scent (and by implication without a soul) trains himself in the art of perfume-making, with the intent of creating a perfume from the bodies of murdered virgins (with a prostitute thrown in, presumably, for the ""base note,"").

Up to about the 2-hour mark, this filmed version of the novel did a truly magnificent job of bringing the novel to life.  I particularly loved Ben Whishaw, who played the bizarre lead character, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Grenouille meaning ""frog"" in French), with a gangly, splay-footed, frog-like gait, gargantuan amphibious eyes, and a remarkable ability to convey his feelings (or lack of them) through those eyes.  Grenouille' sinister sence of smell allows him to catch up with even the finest, most exquisitely beautitful young lady in the province of Grasse, to complete his perfume.

And then, at the two-hour mark things, get very VERY silly; almost Monty-Python silly.  At the moment when Grenouille is sure to hang for his crimes, he applies a bit of his finished perfume; not only is everyone immediately certain that a man who smells like that must be innocent of all crime, but every ONE of the hundreds of peasants standing around waiting for a good crucifixion/hanging is suddenly compelled to a) strip off all clothes and b) attack the nearest naked body regardless of age gender or whatever.

I have to say this is the first time in many decades of filmgoing I have seen an audience laugh OUT LOUD at a scene meant to be moving and dramatic.  It did not offend me, but it made the end of the movie goofy and laughable.

I assume that the director was going for moving and horrific, but he got goofy and laughable instead.  If you'd like to end the evening slapping your knees at hundreds of writhing naked Frenchman, though, this is the film for you.  5 stars for the first 2/3s and 1 star for the end.",1168905600,,2017,4.786743515850144
2938798,5,B000TBG98M,"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, is a darkly beautiful and amazing story of the man whose nose knew ""all the smells in the world"".

Instead, he focuses his attention on the one thing that was ever present in his life, his gift, or perhaps curse, his extraordinary sense of smell.

He uses it to pursue his goal to keep smell, so that such exquisite scent will never disappear again, from his experience with a beautiful redhead that sold plums on the streets.

I can hardly explain how amazingly done this movie is.  The camera shots are gorgeous, when he smelled flowers, you smelled flowers, and are overwhelmed by them on the screen along with dazzling music.

Some of the scenes can be a little strange, with a great deal of nudity.  I know this is more generally accepted in European countries, but most people in the US were turned off by some of the scenes, particularly one at the end, that contains, no less than 5000 nude men and women fondling one another.  Very odd.  But at the same time, it suits the fairy tale like story, and is easily undertood to be the consequences of when one human being is as gifted as our main character, with the ability to create something no one else has ever done before.

""Perfume"" tells the tale of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a Parisian baby born to a rather stupid mother, who, assuming him to be yet another stillbirth, literally tosses him into the gutter. He's hired by a tannery and eventually, when a down-on-his-luck perfume maker Giuseppe Baldini notices his incredible gift for scent, Grenouille sets about achieving greatness in his own peculiar manner.

The biggest problem with ""Perfume"" is that it suffers from the ultimate case of The Emperor's New Nose. There's an imperceptible line of demarcation, much like the two mountain paths recurring in the movie, that divides brilliance from dreck, and sadly, ""Perfume"" hitches its wagon to the latter path, and follows it through to the bitter end.

Performance-wise there's nothing going on we haven't seen before, the nearest thing to honest-to-god acting contained in this movie is Alan Rickman's performance as Antoine Richis, troubled father of the beautiful Laura. Sadly, his part is a very small one (as are all parts of this movie not that of its lead character) and his ridiculously over-the-top speech in the closing minutes of the picture negate any sense of affinity or empathy we might have felt for him. Something about how he's going to seep into Grenouille's pores and come shooting out his nose, or something. I'm not making this up.

As troubled teen Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, Ben Whishaw is a total nonstarter: he's sort of a cross between Beaker from the Muppet Show and a comatose Hannibal Lecter. His emotional range doesn't stretch past looking either A. bored, or B. slightly turned-on. But then, the screenplay must assume its fair share of the blame: Whishaw does for the most part what he can with a really turgid script. It seems someone forgot to explain to the director and screenplay writing team that this, in fact, is a talkie.

The biggest problem with ""Perfume"" is the disparity between what the overly-explicit visuals would have you believe, and what the screenplay actually tells us. Smellovision hasn't yet been invented so clearly the production design and the camerawork are designed to make us believe that we can indeed smell the many strong odours of Grenouille's Paris. It's going for a sense of lushness and full-on olfactory assault. The screenplay gives us a monotonous one-note Tale O' Woe, and it's in this glaring contrast that the essence of what could have been a stellar piece of cinema is totally and irretrievably lost. We keep searching for a mental connection with the content to match our optical connection with the visuals, and sadly, this never arrives.

Don't bother. ""Perfume - Story of a Murderer"" isn't worth your while. Check out Hugh O' Connor in ""The Young Poisoner's Handbook"" for a much more satisfying example of sociopathic teens, or something like ""Dangerous Liaisons"" or ""La Reine Margot"" if Ye Olde France is your thing.",1168646400,,2893,5.067226890756302
2938800,5,B000TBG98M,"As the title suggests, ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is a pure sensory experience, enveloping the audience into a seemingly unending and unconquerable world of scents. It was absolutely amazing that the filmmakers managed to immerse us in such a rich and varied realm: we're incapable of actually smelling the images as they appear on the screen. Nonetheless, we're able to understand what we're being asked to experience along with the main character, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), who was born with an inhumanly strong sense of smell. As he wanders the streets of eighteenth-century France, his nose acts like a filing cabinet, collecting countless numbers of odors and storing them in his memory. Everything emitting a scent is shown to us through some clever camera angles, most of which are extreme close-ups of objects and bodies moving in slow motion.

This first-hand look into Grenouille's world made for quite a unique experience, especially since we're being asked to address a sense that's quite useless for film watching. But his obsessive and ultimately murderous drive to capture the perfect scent enables us to transcend that handicap; even if we can't smell what he smells, various shots enable us to understand that he finds the scents of the world intoxicating. We also gain understanding with the help of John Hurt, the film's narrator. He's quite an important character, considering Grenouille is a young man of very few words. According to some background information, he didn't learn to speak for many years. He was unceremoniously born underneath a foul-smelling fish cart in Paris, the fifth child of a woman whose previous four children were stillborn.

After she's arrested and executed for willful neglect, the infant is sent to an orphanage, and there he remains throughout his entire childhood. It's established almost immediately how unnerved the other children are around the now named Grenouille; he cannot speak, yet he develops a peculiar sense of smell, one that makes him perceptive to everyone around him. This marks the first in a series of plot devices that almost come off as supernatural, a quality that, if not viewed in the right frame of mind, may come off as completely ridiculous. There are a number of moments in this film that require suspension of disbelief. This is especially true of the final major sequence, in which a spur of the moment orgy takes place in the town square.

This isn't to say that they detract from the effectiveness of the story. If anything, they enhance it. Keep in mind that Grenouille is a unique individual; not only is his sense of smell incredibly powerful, he also has no scent of his own. He doesn't learn this until he's older, at which point he's already been sold as cheap labor to a tannery owner.

But this is when things take a much darker turn, and they only get darker as the film progresses. After years of remaining behind the confining walls of the tannery, Grenouille is finally asked to assist in making deliveries. At last, he has the chance to take in the various odors of the city, all of which he has yet to distinguish as bad or good. Then he gets a whiff of a young girl selling yellow plums, and the seduction is complete. He's not interested in buying any of her fruit; he only wants to bask in her heavenly aroma. Unfortunately, restraining her and choking her to death brings him no closer to capturing her scent. He then understands his purpose in life; he shall find the world's most enticing smells, collect them, and make them into a one-of-a-kind perfume.

And as luck would have it, he makes a delivery to Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), an Italian perfumer. At one time, he was well respected and his shop was always full of customers. Now it seems as if he's past his prime, his attempts at creating the next great perfume being thwarted by rival businesses. But then he meets Grenouille, whose powerful nose allows him to pick out exactly the right scents and mix them in exactly the right amounts. Finally, he's found someone who can put him back in business. In becoming an amateur perfumer, Grenouille hopes to learn the fine art of capturing scents.

Unfortunately, Baldini is only familiar with one capturing method: distilling various flora and fauna by boiling them in water. Grenouille's pursuits are far too grand for this method, and it shows through his unsuccessful attempts at distilling the essences of glass, various metals, and Baldini's cat (supposedly for the sake of experimentation). His only other option is a method used in Grasse, a city known for producing the highest quality perfumes: it involves animal fat, which can easily absorb scents. After the fat has been slathered onto flower petals, it is then scraped away, mixed with alcohol, and distilled into concentrated oil. Grenouille immediately leaves for Grasse, knowing that this method will serve his purpose.

At this point, his obsession turns deadly; he kills a number of young girls, capturing their scents by slathering their naked bodies with animal fat, scraping it off, and boiling it with alcohol. I remember how uncomfortable I felt watching the fat sizzling in glass beakers; we're essentially witnessing a madman bottling youth, beauty, and innocence, all of which were previously impossible to collect. The very thought of someone being both skilled and heartless is not exactly pleasant, especially since he needs one more victim to perfect his perfume. Here enters Laura Richis (Rachel Hurd-Wood), a young virgin who lives with her loving father, Antoine (Alan Rickman). Capturing her scent won't be so easy; Grenouille's murder spree has definitely gotten the city's attention.

Such a fascinatingly dark story was enough to get my attention, as well; despite disturbing visuals and heavy-handed subject matter, ""Perfume"" is not easily dismissible. I watched it with grim focus, and I found myself waiting impatiently for the next turn of events. I don't know if I'm helping the film or hurting it by saying that they lead to a particularly odd ending; while I consider it appropriate, some my find it nonsensical and in poor taste. But you have to keep in mind that a supernatural story is being told. It may not seem that way at first; initial appearances make it seem like a straightforward period piece. But as soon as the infant Grenouille inhales the scent of an orphan boy's index finger, it becomes obvious that extraordinary things will happen. A lot of credit has to be given to such a film, especially one in which the everyday sense of smell is successfully woven into the narrative fabric.",1168214400,,6633,4.947935368043088
2938801,5,B000TBG98M,"I read Patrick Suskind's Perfume when it was published in English in 1986.  When I heard over the years that a movie version was planned I never thought it would become reality.  I was always a little uncertain how Grenouille would be presented since he is hardly a hero.  The film is an excellent adaptation of the book with a remarkable performance by Ben Whishaw as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.  Mr. Whishaw manages to convey the ""otherness"" of Grenouille; a feeling he conveys that he is different and an outsider.  He is relegated to his own world of smells and has no need to communicate with people.  The gaunt appearance that Mr. Whishaw achieves is perfect for his character.  It is equally interesting to see his passions aroused when he first detects the scent of a young woman selling fruit.  He truly comes alive and when he accidentally kills the girl his reaction is like a child that has killed a favorite pet; he does not know that he has done anything wrong: he had to relish the scent of the girl.

 Dustin Hoffman makes an interesting Giuseppe Baldini.  His nose is perfect for a perfumer and he does quite well with the role although his accent does not sound terribly Italian.  Alan Rickman is superb as Antoine Richis and Rachel Hurd-Wood, as his daughter Antoine Richis, is very attractive and entirely convinces you that she is an intelligent young woman who would rather do without marriage to the well-meaning but much older Marquis de Montesquieu.

The supporting cast is excellent and beautifully fit into their characters.  The production is first rate and is entirely convincing from the start that you are in 18th century France with all of its squalor and filth.  The CGI effects are quite good, particularly the bridge where Baldini has his shop.  John Hurt lends his mellifluous voice to the film as the narrator, helping to fill us in on Grenouille's workings and motives.

If you have read the book I think you will enjoy the film unconditionally.  For people who have not read the book, I hope you will find the experience a journey of the imagination.  While this is not a morality tale perhaps the moral of this story is that we cannot live (as Grenouille understands in the end) without love and be whole.",1168214400,,2243,4.705128205128205
2938802,5,B000TBG98M,"Devotedly accurate to the best-selling novel, Birkin, Eichinger and Tykwer have made the best film I can remember seeing. The music was written first and the film created around it as this was the prime way of evoking smell - but the use of building colour, absolutely stunning sets, costumes and cinematography, clever use of defining the tiniest of sounds and a stream of colour just enhances the Berlin Philharmonic under Simon Rattle(!). I didn't rate Alan Rickman until I saw this - two scenes in particular - work them out for yourself. Dustin Hoffman combines perfectly the sense of European history, dark and light humour, a huge range of emotions and gravity. Ben Wishawe is perfectly captivating! Buy this film, show it to your friends, children, parents or you may regret it. If you don't quite get the depth at first, watch it again, then keep it and as life reveals more of it's mystery, pain, love and beauty watch it again!",1167523200,,938,4.7607361963190185
2938803,4,B000TBG98M,"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is a visual cinematic feast and a celebration of the goodness of humanity, of being human and of being different. In contrast, it is also a story of obssession and of murder.

Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) was destined to explore and experience the allure and mystery of smell. Growing up in Paris, he is obssessed with scent- no matter what it might be. With a remarkable ability to smell even the slightest and most subtle of scent, he became obssessed in capturing the fragrance of young virgins. Without regard for life, he continues to kill until he got caught and was sentenced to die.

Directed by Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run), Perfume is a study of contrast. Grenouille's power of scent and how he uses it does not differentiate the good and the bad smells of Paris. As he pursues his obssession, we are transported from the stench and cruelties of Paris into the lush and freshness of a fragrant french countryside.

What is so amazing about this film, aside from the intelligent directing and cinematography, is the acting. Ben Whishaw, who only stands at 5'9"" is literally an acting giant. His portrayal of Grenouille is both chilling and fascinating. The subtle changes of emotions on his face is remarkable and deserve much praise. While the character in the Patrick Sskind novel is described as seemingly disfigured and unattractive, Whishaw is the exact opposite. He exudes a certain charisma and innocence mixed with a hint of sexual danger and notoriety. Such mix can only be described as enigmatic. He carried the film and lifted it to a higher level.

Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman both provided superb support to Whishaw.

While there are some departures from the novel, which happens to be one of the most fascinating read, it remains powerful and remarkable.",1167091200,,1821,4.880258899676376
2938804,5,B000TBG98M,"Unwanted hatred offspring was born in a rubbish disposary and abandoned even before a first breath.

Hatred and humiliated by all a growing man had been surrounded by, he developed an indefinite urge for tender and love on a very personal simply biological level not nurtured even with a shadow of community-bounded restrictions a middle-ages society imposed on then living.

Short of education, his obsession and a craft only is making perfumes, based on his very natural superficial capabilities of memorizing the smells and imagine pure physical outcomes from the mixtures of chemicals. By a such extraordinary way he assumes people around and his rather investigatory-out-of-this-world imagination stipulates him pursuing females of whom necessary component extractions had been released.

Knowing no boundaries in his unstoppable quest for these rather witchery activities, a young man not only converted his execution in a mass orgy but made himself an object of an indefinite sexual attraction, which act had ended his human existence.

Although this movie might for instance be lined up with ""Interview with Vampire"", ""The Queen of Damned "" and, to some extend, ""The Brothers Grimm"", its deep philosophical meaning could hardly gratify a broad majority of cinema-goers.

Personally, I would return to this brilliant work in some time later.",1165708800,,1348,5.430622009569378
2938805,4,B000TBG98M,"Everyone who read Patrick Suskind's ""Das Parfum"" must remember how well-scented and at the same time fetid it was. Every page of the novel effuses some smell and it literally makes you either savor it or hold your nose in disgust. Suskind's talent in describing different kinds of flavour can't be overestimated, like a real poet he finds words and metaphors that sometimes let you salivate and sometimes bring you very close to throwing up. In my opinion the main challenge of this film from the very beginning of its creation was: will this movie smell like the book does?

Many great directors were to make ""Perfume..."" and many washed their hands for a variety of reasons. Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman, Tim Burton and others - all of them were once attached to the project and walked away. Stanley Kubrick nurtured the idea of filming Suskind's novel for a long time but finally concluded ""Das Parfum"" was UNFILMABLE. And I can understand that - the book based on all kinds of odours is very hard to be put on celluloid. So walking to the theater I was recalling the book's first scene taking place at Paris' fish market couple of centuries back and thinking - will it all smell?

And - oh, my God - it did! It smelled and it reeked right from the screen. Certainly the book smelled better (or worse in this case) but those things you do not see but only imagine always hit harder, so I doubt any movie can be better than a book. But in this case actually it wasn't this film's idea - to top the novel, it just had to match it distantly. And it matched indeed. ""Perfume..."" is no cheap adaptation of another book - it's a piece of art of its own and it deserves some recognition. Tom Tykwer - a young German director whose best-known work to date was ""Run, Lola, Run"" seemed rather strange candidate to direct this picture at the first glance, but ultimately it turned out to be a wise idea. Tykwer is not afraid to experiment and we've seen it in ""Lola"". Many of his patterns and tricks from that movie were later used by a number of directors around the world. He is innovative and that's a fact. If you close your eyes and try hard to imagine what Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman or Tim Burton would do with this picture, I bet you'll come up with some idea and I bet it will be right. But what could we expect from Tom Tykwer? Only some surprise.

Finally there were no surprise and in ""Perfume..."" Tykwer didn't invent anything. It was pretty traditional I'd say, but still very professional, magnificent and exciting. Still better than I think any other director would manage it. And what's most important - it SMELLED. It had all the scents and fragrances needed to feel yourself inside this movie. Tykwer didn't do the impossible, but he was very close... And in this case it's a hell of an achievement.

Actors deserve a whole separate article, I'll only say Ben Whishaw and everyone else except Dustin Hoffman were awesome and the latter is still playing the role of Bernie Focker as it seems with all my respect :) Although I like THAT role of his a lot I think here he could be a little more serious. On the other hand - don't pay attention to my lamentations - a comic part was never too bad for any movie. So maybe it's just me. Anyway - why 4 stars? 5 would go for the impossible done by the director, but unfortunately I'm positive it was impossible to do so (no pun intended). Hence 4 is the highest rating this picture can get in my opinion and I'm giving it the highest rating possible.",1160956800,,3508,4.442546583850931

8218333,5,B000TBG98M,"A close friend recommended this movie to me because we share a romantic fascination with scents. But regardless of that fascination, this movie was fantastic! The cinematography, acting, and dialog were all captivating. This movie, through the cinematography, romanticizes life in France during that era, as well as shows you the darker underbelly. It really showcases that none of the luxuries we enjoy come without someone we don't see suffering.

I would write a ton more, but I don't want to spoil it for anyon reading this before watching the movie. All I want to say now before I go, is that the casting choices were perfect. The late Alan Rickman, and the marvelous Dustin Hoffman is in it.
