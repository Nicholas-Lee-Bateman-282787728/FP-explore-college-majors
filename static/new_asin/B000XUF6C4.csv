3007968,5,B000XUF6C4,"I love this series.  The detective played by Carolyn Quentin is so human and funny and smart.  I love how each episode gives us a glimpse of her challenging family life (single mother, 4 children!) and how she manages to balance that life with her career as a Detective Inspector.  I love her 2nd in command, Ian Kelsey, and the wonderful sexual tension between the two.  I live in hope they will ultimately get together for I have a suspicion they just might ""make it.""
The mysteries in each episode are very good and engrossing and Janine and her team always bring them to very satisfying conclusions.  I hope the series will continue for a long time to come.",1218844800,3,661,4.5210084033613445
3007969,4,B000XUF6C4,"""Blue Murder, Set 2,""a crime drama/police procedural, chronicles the doings of a Manchester-based contemporary female British detective who's both a top cop and a single mum to four.  It was made by British Independent Television (ITV), and is a ratings hit in the United Kingdom, but has not yet been broadcast here.  It is, inevitably, reminiscent of Helen Mirren's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prime-Suspect-1/dp/B0000AYJV5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prime Suspect 1</a>; though the mysteries tend to be somewhat kinder and gentler.

In the lead role, DSI Janine Lewis, Caroline Quentin(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jonathan-Creek-Season-One/dp/B000GYI3MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jonathan Creek - Season One</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-Behaving-Badly-The-Complete-Collection-The-Original-British-TV-Series/dp/B000H6SXZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men Behaving Badly - The Complete Collection (The Original British TV Series)</a>) gets a chance to prove herself a substantial actress, as well as a talented comedienne.  In her job, she faces  drive-by shootings, abducted children, and police corruption; at home, the, praises be, no longer all that young, nor all that slim, detective interviews nanny candidates, and attempts to comfort her bullied young son.  Ian Kelsey (""Casualty"") co-stars as her second in command, handsome DI Richard Mayne; he provides romantic and sometimes professional tension.  And as Detective Schapp, Nicholas Murchie turns in particularly flavorful performances.  The series is filmed on location in Manchester, a busy Midlands city that we don't get to see much of here, and it looks good.  Enough extras have been hired so that the city bustles as it should, too.  The actors have been encouraged to trot out their Manchester accents, which add a lot of atmosphere to the productions, and, thankfully, Acorn Media has added unadvertised subtitles, so that we can actually follow what's happening, local slang and all.  However, the series' direction could be tightened a bit; the actors sometimes tend to stand around, posing.

In Episode 1, ""The Spartacus Thing,"" we meet a fairly dysfunctional family.  Mrs. Hickson has killed her husband's dog: he has strangled her with a dog chain, and served only eighteen months for it.  Upon his release, he is strangled in strikingly similar fashion.  Fifteen members of his dead wife's family confess to the murder.  This episode piles up the most unlikely events to reach a conclusion.

Episode 2, ""Make Believe,"" concerns three-year old Sammy Wray, who apparently vanishes into thin air from a neighborhood playground.  Soon, the body of a child of similar age turns up nearby, wrapped in a sheet in a drainage tunnel.  The plot's tight, has some good twists and turns, is emotionally involving, and will keep most viewers' attention.

Episode 3, ""In Deep,"" follows a group of four college friends who used to fish together at a nearby lake, where the body of a man eventually identified as Mickey Day, small-time crook and drug dealer, is found.  Now someone's picking off the college friends, one by one.  This episode, too, must pile up the most unlikely events to reach conclusion.

Episode 4, ""Steady Eddie,"" tells the story of Eddie Carter, popular copper's cop, who preferred walking the beat to climbing the slippery ladder of departmental promotion.  When a jewelry heist goes wrong, and Carter is killed in a drive-by shooting, Janine and her team are forced to investigate him, and find out some things about him that they'd rather not have.  Again, an absorbing mystery, with plenty of twists and turns.

Now, I'm not sure who's been asking for kinder, gentler British mysteries; surely, not me.  I find&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hetty-Wainthropp-Investigates-Complete-Collection/dp/B000R349GQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hetty Wainthropp Investigates - Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;acceptable, because, after all, the title character is played by Patricia Routledge, better known as our Hyacinthe Bucket, from the hilarious Britcom&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keeping-Up-Appearances-The-Full-Bouquet/dp/B0019MFY36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keeping Up Appearances: The Full Bouquet</a>.

3007970,5,B000XUF6C4,"HIT AND RUN - Two crimes, two deaths, two lines come together in the course of the enquiry. The tricky intricacies of the two lines and how they get together is the core of the film. So you'll have to watch it to know. The first line is a hit and run with an officially reported stolen car But the hit and run was caused by the stress of the mission the driver was on. The second line is that of illegal immigration from Eastern Europe: girls who come to England to be nothing but whores and eventually barmaids, to cover up the deal. And then you add to that a fictitious pimp who looks and sounds like Bizet's famous invisible Arl&eacute;sienne. What appears clearly in this episode is that the author cooled down the DCS and insisted on the social and political problem treated here. Quite a good job. FRAGILE RELATIONS - Here, Manchester explodes with another social problem, that of the large Moslem Pakistani community. It all spins around a mosque and a young mullah who is assassinated. You double this side of the problem with the militancy of a racist party and its leader and you have an explosive situation and some would like to excuse the lack of a real enquiry with the danger of this explosive social, religious and ethnic situation. The film shows how the English have set up a local police corps entirely composed of members of the community to do the police work in this community, and one of the members of that unit will be the interface between the Manchester criminal unit and the mosque officials and community and that's how the truth will finally come up and out, how too the female Inspector will be able to enter the inner circle of the mosque without creating any resentment. UP IN SMOKE - Another social situation, a crematorium mind you. Fascinating though horribly morbid, especially when you find out that there seems to be a few more bodies that got burnt than the official count. We know how the missing people, or bodies ended in flames. The point is to find who did it. Nearly easy to suspect it. But the trick here is the sordid reason why a plain love affair turned into a tragedy. Early teen pregnancy, an adoption and then imagine twenty years later when two people fall in love and discover one day they are mother and son. A mountain of guilt explodes out of the earth and then submerges the actors of the tragedy with a volcanic explosion. Everyone gets either burnt or at least singed. A marvelous trashy mess in which we live without knowing about it. LONELY - This episode is very strong and powerful from the very start. All the characters are potential killers. They all have a motive and none has an alibi. And the solution that will come out is a little bit easy because of the final discovery of the murder weapon that should never have been found and especially not with finger prints on it if the ultimate outcome is to be believed. That's maybe a weakness among the plot-writers. A Deus Ex Machina coming out of nowhere. The end of the second season. The need of a vacation, or is it a holiday? We'll see in the next series if the weakness has been strengthened enough to enable the series to last some more. But the culprit is unluckily a very difficult case that cannot be depicted in any way, thence the weakness in the plot.

8229756,5,B000XUF6C4,"I've been a fan of Caroline Quentin ever since I saw her in 'Jonathan Creek'. When I discovered the series 'Blue Murder', I was overjoyed that there was more crime drama goodness out there with her in it. One box set later, I can safely say that my love affair with Quentin is still going strong.

The plots in this set range from the disappearance & possible murder of a small child to the investigation of a fallen cop that uncovers some dirty secrets. Throughout it all, Janine (Quentin) must attempt to juggle not only her busy & challenging job as the chief inspector with her family & personal life. With some of her cases hitting a little too close to home, it's no easy task.

The great thing about this series is that it is episodic, similar to series such as 'Law & Order'. You can watch one episode without watching everything prior to it & despite the somewhat complicated overlying plot arcs, it's still rather easy to explain what is going on to the newcomers. (My mother sat & watched this set with me & picked up on the plot with little to no problem.)

I also like that the characters are all heavily flawed. It's one thing to have a set of slick & overly pretty characters who are all in love with each other, but it's another to have a set of characters who get drunk, act stupid & make mistakes. (Caroline Quentin playing a drunk Janine is just awesome.)

Basically, if you want an awesome British series, watch this one. It's not as glamorous seeming as some of the other stuff that's come out of the UK, but is is one of the grittiest & most realistic series that's come out in a while.",1257033600,3,1608,4.367892976588629
