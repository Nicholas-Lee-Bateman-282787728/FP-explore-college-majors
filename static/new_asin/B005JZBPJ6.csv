4713904,5,B005JZBPJ6,This package arrived on time and without damage.  Four of the episodes on the first DVD took place while Raymond Burr was either in the hospital for surgery or at home recovering from the surgery so there are replacement actors for him.  It's really hard to fill Raymond Burr's shoes as Perry Mason so while good the episodes aren't at the same level as those with Raymond Burr.  Remember though only four of the episodes are like this - all the rest have Mr. Burr and Mr. Burr makes a couple appearances even a few of the four with people standing in for him.  My only complaint - I wish they'd release the entire series!,1324684800,9,622,4.3826086956521735

4713906,4,B005JZBPJ6,I love the Perry Mason series so I would buy the set anyway but you should know that in several of the episodes Perry is in the hospital and stars are brought in to replace him. Otherwise I love the season 6 set.,1323734400,,212,3.953488372093023

4713908,4,B005JZBPJ6,"In the second half of Season Six we continue to slip away from the early film noir feeling of this series, and more into a sixties flavor. The acting and writing are not at their peak. But Perry Mason is a great show no matter what. Here are the episodes:

1. The Case of the Prankish Professor
2. The Case of Constant Doyle - Bette Davis filling in for an absent Raymond Burr (who makes a short appearance on the phone, in his bathrobe)
3. The Case of the Libelous Locked - Michael Rennie filling in for Raymond Burr
4. The Case of the Two-Faces Turn-a-bout - Hugh O'Brien filling in
5. The Case of the Surplus Suitor - Walter Pidgeon filling in
6. The Case of the Golden Oranges - Perry is back!
7. The Case of the Lawful Lazarus
8. The Case of the Velvet Claws
9. The Case of the Lover's Leap
10. The Case of the Elusive Element
11. The Case of the Greek Goddess
12. The Case of the Skeleton's Closet
13. The Case of the Potted Planter
14. The Case of the Witless Witness",1322870400,69,974,4.126315789473685
4713909,5,B005JZBPJ6,"Bette Davis, Michael Rennie, Hugh O'Brien...in early 1963 these were big stars. So with Perry (Raymond Burr) recuperating from some illness, the gang at Paisano Productions spared no expense getting credible substitutes for the ailing star. Actually, and to my surprise, it worked.

In the Case of Constant Doyle, one of only three episodes not titled ""Case of the"" with the ""the"" underlined, Bette Davis stars as the widow and law partner of a great lawyer who undertakes to represent a young man accused of, what else, murder. Better yet the murder is connected to one of her husbands old clients.  The CEO gives sage advice like, there are opportunities for women lawyers in divorces and juvenile justice. Bette, a veritable Portia, tears up the prosecution as neatly as Perry ever did, undoubtably causing young girls of the sixties to wonder if there could be life at the bar for them. Consider that when I entered law school in 1972 we had 9 women in a class of 200, yet by the time I left three years later  the entering class was 35% female. Many of us were there because of Perry which makes the Bette Davis episode intriguing.

Michael Rennie, the space man from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-the-Earth-Stood-Still/dp/B00005JKFR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a>&nbsp;takes over a case where one of the suspects could be a ""Martian nine feet tall."" Don't tell me the writers didn't have fun with that line. Hugh O'Brien plays Bruce Jason, an OSS operative implicated in an assassination plot  but nonetheless defending the accused. The foreign actors, hired for the shoot, marvelously overacted like they were still doing war-era B movies. O'Brien, for his part, was familiar to all TV viewers of the time as the star of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Legend-of-Wyatt-Earp/dp/B005TZFYWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life & Legend of Wyatt Earp</a>.

As good as these interludes are, Perry does return for his courtroom heroics, and the bathrobe cameos are soon forgotten. This set however is a tribute to the producers and writers of the best lawyer show of the 20th century.",1322524800,40,2212,5.510324483775811

4713939,5,B005JZBPJ6,"The original Perry Mason TV series (1957-1966) deserves a special commendation for being free of derogatory racial stereotypes -- an astonishing accomplishment, especially for that era!!*

In fact, the Perry Mason TV series (1957-1966) seemed to go out of it's way to subversively include dignified people of color, in non-stereotypical roles, usually skillfully hidden in plain view among the extras in the background.  Due to perspective, the POC sometimes appear to be on Raymond Burr's shoulder or otherwise connected to him.  Thanks RB. Shout out to the cast and production team (especially Gail Patrick Jackson).

In *""The Case of the Skeleton's Closet""* S06E26 (1963), the production team hired as *the presiding judge* a dignified unmistakably *black male* (0:45:15 - 0:45:20 approx.) who IMO resembles current U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

In some ways, the 1950's era TV series was also directly *subversive of  Jim Crow.*  For example, in episodes such as *""The Case of the Runaway Corpse""* S01E10 (1957), the production team very cleverly and surreptitiously introduced an *interracial couple* (WM/BF), @ 0:46:53 - 0:47:10 approximately !!

Perry Mason was television's most successful and longest-running lawyer series.  At the time of its cancellation, Perry Mason was or had been airing in 58 countries.  ""I had no life outside of Perry Mason,"" Raymond Burr recalled.  ""And that went on 24 hours a day, six days a week. I never went home at night. I lived on the lot. I had a kitchen, bedroom, office space, sitting room  all of that.""  Wikipedia: Perry Mason (TV series).

4713941,5,B005JZBPJ6,"Perry Mason Season 6 Volume 2

These fourteen TV shows from 1963 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The books are more complete and informative, they tell about life that is not experienced by most people. The books explain why some things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ropers, rough or smooth shadows, how to evade surveillance, and avoid leaving a back trail. Some questioned the legality and ethics of Perry Masons tactics but the stories were written before modern legal rules. The background tells about life in Los Angeles and America. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on todays broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? Erle Stanley Gardner was a founder of the Court of Last Resort which sought to free the unjustly convicted. Gardner sought to use scientific means to find the guilty rather than using hunches or guesses alone.

The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Some of the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent, but these films have a higher contrast than in earlier seasons. These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings and often tell about the law. The cars tell of product placement. The titles begin with The Case of the .... A story adapted from a novel has the year. Most are not from the novels; a year after the title shows the Gardner novel. Witless Witness was written by Marshall Houts.

Four shows had actors to fill in for hospitalized Raymond Burr: Constant Doyle had Bette Davis, Libelous Locket had Michael Rennie, Two faced Turnabout had Hugh OBrian, Surplus Suitor had Walter Pidgeon.

With only 16 episodes per volume, the price of each Perry Mason DVD is expensive right off the bat, but, when you consider that FOUR of the episodes of this particular volume do NOT even star Raymond Burr, it becomes obvious that SEASON 6, VOLUME 2 fails to offer value for the money!!! Apparently Mr Burr underwent an operation while the studio filmed the four episodes mentioned above, and his presence is DEARLY missed!",1365033600,3,564,4.76530612244898

We are up to Season 7, which I assume will be released sometime this year (2012). For some reason, CBS does not seem to be really interested in fan requests to speed up the release of the remaining seasons. Perhaps Amazon will be able to identify a release date for the next set (Season 7, Volume 1; and Season 7, Volume 2).",1326672000,11,468,4.269662921348314

He loves sitting in my lap to watch the courtroom dramas unfold. He had a particular complaint about this set, though. The first few episodes do not show Mason at all. The defense attorneys are played by famous ""guest stars.""  Otherwise, these are most enjoyable, although it is obvious that whoever put this show together knew very little about actual courtroom procedure. Today I enjoy them as a kind of time capsule - a remote view of the late 50's and early '60's and the kind of society that existed, so different from our current one, such a short time ago.",1326499200,13,738,4.426470588235294
