8047257,4,B0007GP7QY,"I pre WWI aristocratic friends re-enact the novel ""Aphrodite""
in a sumptuous seaside estate on a Greek isle. Naturally, the virginal Kaprisky is assigned the role of Aprodite. The women are all extremely beautiful and, for the most part, the sex is erotic and sensuous. However, there are a few scenes with male genitalia in the shadows that some may object to.

All in all, I enjoyed the erotica.",1232841600,,397,4.753623188405797

8047259,1,B0007GP7QY,"Dont even bother, just look at the product specs at the running time. The difference between 88 and 90 minutes might not seem like much but for this movie its the whole cake. If I just wanted to see Valerie standing naked in front of a mirror I would download a picture off the internet. What you are looking for is the orgy which contains things rivaling Caligula.

8047260,5,B0007GP7QY,"The expectations going into to this were not high when I first rented this video back in 1988. I was overwhelmed. I had seen the overwrought pomposity that was Caligula, and was not impressed. Here is a delicacy that stimulated several areas of the cinematic pallette. It has fetching leads, a potent set of erotic images, a plausible period setting (with a interesting back-story), and most importantly, there is a genuine feeling of sweet innocence that permeates up to the very end. Some of the eroticism was too much, too soon, but in the end it served to underscore the chemistry between the lead characters. You just root for them to escape from all that debauchery. Aside from the silly idea of a gay man being ""converted"" while giving a woman a massage, the themes involved were challenging and asured for being so graphic. I have seen other European erotica since, but none that have been as endearing as Kaprisky and the assortment of frolicing thespians from Aphrodite. It would seem that 1982 was a very good year for Sex on film. It also saw the release of Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and AN Officer and A Gentleman. I can honestly say that I will always love these films.",1061769600,8,1187,4.6571428571428575
8047261,3,B0007GP7QY,"There are several elements about this movie that are in direct conflict in my mind. One, the pre-WWI setting and pace as the movie starts gives you a feeling, that certain elegance is there, and by the intrigue that starts developing that the movie is going to be more complex. Then, somewhere almost at the middle you watch this work fall apart. Some by having this scheme developed  by a ""Master Mind"" against an antagonist, that I can only describe as a ""Buffoon"" on his better days, but happens to be of Royal Position and Owner of the retreat in which this story takes place. Then to add to my frustration, with exception of two additional characters played by good actors doing their best in the supporting roles, the rest are lightly coaxed into this "" play "" within the story contradicting the morals they displayed but, somehow, without explanation they are willing to shed and participate in. But then, I am also a big fan of Valerie K., and look for almost any excuse to see anything that she has made. And the version that I viewed is also (Unrated), which has several and in detail orgies of a graphic sexual content that rivals anything released since. You'll just have to watch it and decide for yourself!.",1014940800,10,1221,4.60091743119266
