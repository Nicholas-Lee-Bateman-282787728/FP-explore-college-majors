It has a nostalgic, remember how it was back in the days kind of feel to it. Good story. I'm glad I purchased it.",1334275200,2,274,4.0
8205124,4,B000SBPXYO,"Would have given this 5 stars if it was in English instead of Visayan which my parents spoke. Bought this dvd because my Tagalog wife told me to get it after we saw it at an APA event this past May. Plus it would be nice to see it several times again so I can concentrate more on the great scenery and less on the English subtitles. Didn't have the usual overly dramatics I usually saw in the Tagalog movies that my wife would get for my parents. Was nice to see this movie set in Bohol where many of my relatives still are living. Also set during WWII which is what I reminisce what Bohol was like during my visits there in the 50s thru 70s, unlike the way it's more like here in the US during my visit back there in 2005. I recommend this movie to anyone, not just Phlips, who enjoys foreign movies with English subtitles or to any person who can speak Visayan...",1281744000,2,865,4.154761904761905
8205125,4,B000SBPXYO,"Though I don't think this is necessarily the first Bisaya movie ever made (in a Philippine media dominated by Tagalog), it is one of the most important, if not the most important release in recent years.  As a Cebuano who speaks Bisaya / Visaya, it was such a shocker in the beginning to hear a totally Bisaya Filipino movie that I chuckled incredulously a couple of times--was I really hearing them speak my language?  LOL

Apart from its significance in Filipino movie history, it is also a good movie on its own.  It's a classic love triangle story--or is it quadrangle?--that moves along quite well.  Granted, I'm biased, because I was just so happy to see a non-Tagalog movie for the first time that my eyes were glued.  But if one test of a movie's worth is its ability to be interesting the third, fourth and fifth time you've watched it, then this movie is definitely up to par.

Overall, I highly recommend this flick!  It's just too cool not to be a part of your Filipino Movie library.

Note: Amazon has erroneously listed this movie as a ""Tagalog"" movie when, in fact, it is not. This is a crucial point, considering one of the significant aspects of this movies is that it is done in Bisaya and NOT Tagalog, which is the predominant language of Filipino movies. Sorry Amazon, you know I love you, but you gotta fix the title!",1219968000,6,1338,4.518672199170124
