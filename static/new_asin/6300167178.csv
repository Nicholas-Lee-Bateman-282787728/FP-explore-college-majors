217243,1,6300167178,"I have the Mother Goose Treasury Volumes 1 & 2, and when I went to play 3 & 4, I read the back of the video and all of the songs/rhymes are the same.

I am a little disappointed.",1251417600,,178,3.5641025641025643

7804182,5,6300167178,Innocent.  Perfect for children 4-5 even.  They love these videos.,1416614400,,66,5.5
7804183,1,6300167178,"This movie was labled ""The Mother Goose Treasury Volumes III & IV""  on both the tape and case but it actually played Volumes  I & II.  Didn't get what I ordered at ALL!!!  Don't buy it... who knows what you'll get.",1359504000,,214,4.146341463414634
7804184,4,6300167178,"We had the first two volumes for my daughter and she loved them and would watch them over and over.  We just discovered there were actually two more. These ones are much like the first two, except from an adult view they seem to have some humor in them in many ways that adults may get a kick out of, while  your kids still will love them.  Geared for the very young though.",1359504000,,374,4.095890410958904
7804185,3,6300167178,"I liked this tape, I watched these movies when I was little, but the volumes 1 and 2 are better, and more entertaining. Not to mention funnier.",1313712000,,143,4.333333333333333
7804186,5,6300167178,"I had all 4 volumes on seperate tapes as a kid. I remember we bought them at the 99 cent store lol so that's not saying much for the quality of the movies, but when you're a kid in the 90's you really don't pay much attention to that. I loved them anyway. My cousins and I would watch them over & over again. Singing along with every song. I can't wait to watch them all again!",1312934400,,377,3.909090909090909
7804187,1,6300167178,"This is the same VHS as The Mother Goose Vol. III & IV.  I didn't realize & was upset that it was represented as a different VHS.  Took to the Consignment story in town for the hospital.  Was very disappointed with the representation.  I know I fault for not looking closer, but dealer would do nothing about it.",1304812800,,312,4.327586206896552
7804188,5,6300167178,"These are 18 DIFFERENT rhymes than the 18 in Vols I & II.
My 3-year old son and I enjoyed the story line linking the familiar and colorfully performed classic rhymes. As an adult, the enormous gosling (not quite as cute as say Baby Huey) irritated me with a bit too much gratuitous honking here and there. This tape was released in 1991 and lacks the animation and special effects of newer children's videos. The costumes and sets are lavish and work with the Old Mother Hubbard collection.
On this video (Volumes III & IV, (different songs than I & II)) are included:
1. One, Two, Buckle My Shoe
2. Little Bo Peep
3. The Queen of Hearts
4. Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush
5. There Was An Old Woman Who Lived In A Shoe
6. This Is The House Jack Built
7. ""A"" Was An Archer
8. I Would If I Could
9. I Knew A Little Person
10. Star Light, Star Bright
11. Old Mother Hubbard
12. Itsy, Bitsy Spider
13. Tom, He Was A Piper's Son
14. Wee Willie Winkle
15. It's Raining, It's Pouring
16. Jumping Joan/Handy Spandy
17. Gregory Griggs
18. One, Two, Three, Four

On Volumes I & II are another 18 selections:
(not all listed here, but including)
Old King Cole
London Bridge
Tom Thumb
Humpty Dumpty
Little Miss Muffet
Jack Be Nimble, Jack Be Quick
Simple Simon

In all, a well executed musical video for young ones.",1267833600,3,1306,4.283400809716599
