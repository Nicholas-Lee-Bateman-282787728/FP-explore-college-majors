6068303,2,B00GA8Z0B0,"This movie was a big disappointment.  It did not focus on the accomplishments of this great scientist, nor on the holiness of the fine priest that he was.  The story seemed more like a soap opera than a biography of a brilliant man.  This is the first Ignatius Press movie that I have not thoroughly enjoyed, and it is difficult to give an honest review.  I would not recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inspirational movie.",1394064000,,433,4.443037974683544
6068304,4,B00GA8Z0B0,"Father Gregor Mendel, a 19th century Augustinian friar in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, is considered the father of genetics due to his study of hereditary traits in plants. Mendel's revolutionary experiments on pea plants, although leading him to conclusions (what we now call ""Mendelian genes"") later discredited just as Einstein discredited Newton, established the basic principles of modern genetics. This European-produced film, appropriately titled ""The Gardener of God,"" is a noble but flawed effort to depict the life of this Catholic priest and scientist.

The French actor Christopher Lambert of ""Highlander"" fame plays Mendel with his trademark genial intensity, and it's good to see him on the screen in a substantive role again after so many trashy projects. He is definitely the strongest asset of the production, but there are a few other surprisingly good elements in this low-budget independent film. There are some high production values here, including the authentic-looking exterior locations in beautiful Austria and several lush interior sets and costumes. Together with some lovely photography and classical musical themes, these elements give the movie a high-gloss ""Masterpiece Theater"" glow, and one sometimes feels during certain scenes -- especially scenes involving the Austrian princess's servants gossiping in the kitchen or storeroom -- as though ""Downtown Abbey"" has come to visit. The film looks good and sounds good, with restrained acting that doesn't embarrass itself.

On the other hand, the unfocused screenplay is nearly impossible to follow, and the production's low budget really spoils a few key scenes. Although the opening scene surprised me by grabbing my attention, the rest of the film fails to sustain this momentum, descending quickly into a series of disconnected scenes with little apparent relevance to the driving passions of Mendel's life. As the movie progresses, Lambert's screen time diminishes and the role of two wealthy women (including a widowed princess) who see Father Mendel for spiritual direction increases. It appears that Liana Marabini, the wealthy Italian filmmaker who financed this film in addition to directing and writing it, wants to focus on Mendel's life through the eyes of the women who fought to have him as a spiritual director in what appears to be a thinly veiled sexual attraction. But there's no energy, no narrative, and no dramatic tension to focus the movie. Rather than focusing on Mendel as the title suggests, the movie zeroes in on the two women's battle for Father Mendel's attention and surprisingly stays there, never letting Lambert truly shine.

The biggest problem of the movie is that Christopher Lambert is simply not in it very much, but yields the floor to the women and their concerns, which seem disconnected from his story. These rich women, who appear to be alter egos of sorts for Marabini, are uniquely boring in their bourgeois concerns about the men in their lives, and the film lurches through endless drawing room scenes that do not seem to serve any point. Although we are clearly meant to identify with the Austrian princess over the other woman, whose superficial attraction to Father Mendel is portrayed negatively, the princess (whom I suspect represents Marabini as she seems to be meant as a heroine) is so gratingly self-righteous and blandly portrayed that it's impossible to identify with her. Expecting a film on Gregor Mendel, we gradually find ourselves confronted by a vanity film about the rich aristocratic German women who knew him, and the film's essential shallowness eventually becomes apparent as it revels in their narcissism.

The scenes in the ""Vienna Parliament"" (so identified in a screen caption because it's the only setting in the film that is howlingly inauthentic) are particularly embarrassing, almost looking as though Marabini inserted footage of a high school play into the film's reels. Ironically, this is the one scene that did not need a subtitle, as the rest of the movie is so free of story transitions and context that one labors in vain to follow it. To add insult to injury, the Parliament scenes serve no apparent purpose whatsoever, as the cheap set is so bad (especially compared with Vienna's iconic Parliament and other buildings, which stick in your memory if you've ever seen them) that one almost misses the fact that Father Mendel is there to defend the Catholic Church from the government's attempts to tax it...or something like that. Whatever Father Mendel is doing in this film is entirely lost in the soap opera subplots about the woman whose young son wants to be a priest, the young man's marriage proposal, and other such cornball story threads. I only wish this film had been more about Father Mendel's experiments and the complementary harmony of religion and science that marked his life. As the only feature film on Mendel known to me, this movie might be of historical interest to some, but it's a tough one to sit through.

The DVD has no special features, just an ad for Ignatius Press that rolls straight into the movie.",1390003200,7,5101,5.163240628778718
6068305,1,B00GA8Z0B0,"Dreadful movie-script, direction, acting not up to par of other Ignastius press releases. Very disappointed. Forget this one. One questions what this movie was all about.",1389312000,2,170,5.576923076923077
6068306,4,B00GA8Z0B0,"A story surrounding the latter half of the life of the  famed father of genetics, Gregor Mendel, this film not only broaches his work on genetics but his other attributes of which we know so little about,; that of being well respected in the Austro-Hungarian empire of being a man not only of great learning, but also of being a model priest and a great spiritual director as well as being very humble, despite his many gifts. This film also evolves around two women, who would become his spiritual daughters. They are Hanna von Limburg and Erica von Baumann. A significant portion of this film revolves around their friendship with Fr. Mendel and with each other, and little on Mendel's scientific achievements.

There are many aspects to this movie which are good. They are enumerated as follows.

1. The importance of the sacrament of Confession/Reconciliation

2. A great explanation on the importance of the Catholic priesthood and the priestly vocation. A lot of emphasis is placed on the catechesis of the priestly vocation and the call to priesthood.

3. The importance that lay people have in outreach and in the evangelization of their brethren. Also the importance of the spiritual acts of mercy.

4. The need for spiritual direction to guide the faithful and the need for good spiritual directors.

5.  The irresponsibility of human kind when dealing with science and scientific discoveries and the immense need to be guided by a good conscience and right faith in utilizing and implementing them.

6. This film also bravely explores certain `occupational hazards' that priests encounter in their daily lives.

One also learns how much the Catholic Church has contributed to the world of science and she (the Church) has always encouraged science and the pursuit of knowledge, and finally that there is no conflict between God and science

A little known fact is that Gregor Mendel's discoveries in the field of genetics in turn made possible the discovery of DNA by Watson and Crick in the 1950's.

One of the best lines in the movie is 'science is the effort man makes to be worthy of God'.

Great costumes and beautiful classical music contribute to this film. For the most part the acting is good, but some actors were....errh...terrible.

Considering the fact that this is a low budget film, I guess I shouldn't complain, but the scenes showing the Austro- Hungarian parliament, well.....there were only 7 people in the entire parliament (very small parliament for a very big country!)

And when the ladies talk about Fr. Mendel's talks being sold out, there were only about 12 people in the audience! (I guess it was a very small auditorium!)

But the fact remains that this IS a low budget film and so expecting award winning performances from a cast of mainly amateur actors is really pushing the buck!

Also there are two rather 'interesting' lines in the film....I will say no more. Try to spot them out yourselves! I did not like those two lines!

However, the pros definitely outweigh the cons for this 110 minute film in English, which has NO subtitles, scene selections or special features, nor a booklet. This movie is a little slow in its movements (therefore if you're the patient type you'll survive, if not don't bother!). But the points above make it worth the while.

My rating of 4 stars for this film reflects more on the content enumerated than the quality of the acting or the production. These were well explained and if one can see beyond the production quality, it makes for great catechesis. Who knows? Hopefully it might lead to a better version in the future.

A watchable film.",1386806400,27,3621,4.847402597402597

6068308,5,B00GA8Z0B0,The struggle of the man of God between his faith and his scientific discoveries is so well described by the director and Christofer Lambert as the Gardener of God is the perfect choice. A must to be seen!,1403308800,,204,4.394736842105263
6068309,1,B00GA8Z0B0,"My mom bought this for me for my birthday as she knows I'm a big fan of Mendel having studied his work multiple times throughout school and we eagerly watched it together. Unfortunately we couldn't have been more disappointed. It was really a sad experience with my poor mom feeling the need to apologize multiple times as the ""story"" got more and more muddled and ridiculous.

The movie is titled ""The Gardener of God"", but Mendel's pea plants/garden/labwork is literally never mentioned or seen. They all vaguely refer to his past ""discovery"", and there is a short scene where he describes a bit of his work, sounding like he's reading from textbook.  The front of the dang dvd case shows him working with plants and his drawings behind him, but all events in the movie take place later in his life when he's no longer practicing science.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the movie centers not around Mendel, but around two women who clearly have major hots for him. The opening scene sets the tone, with the princess impatiently waiting in the antechamber of Mendel's office while you hear a second woman giggling provocatively with Mendel in the other room. When they appear, she is wearing a low cut fancy satin party dress (notable because in a following scene at a PARTY at her house she is wearing a modest long sleeve high neck gown).  The audience mistakenly gets the feeling that Mendel was doing more with the countess than hearing the former prostitute's confession. We also see multiple scenes into the life of the countess, including a flashback/nightmare to her time at the brothel. The princess and countess spend most of the movie talking about how handsome and seductive Mendel is, and how they don't want him wasting his time talking with ""empty-headed people""-- meaning the female students they see asking for his autograph after he speaks. No chance those students could have been attracted to his ground breaking work with his pea plants (which are NEVER mentioned).  They both selfishly conclude that those students must be jealous of the princess because she is clearly such good friends with Mendel. Honestly it was gross.

Another large portion of the movie is spent on the story of the illegitimate son of the princess's husband. WHY?? He's a ten-year-old beginning seminary who's mother has finally given up on married men and  is getting married herself, what joy! We watch as the soon-to-be step-dad cautiously asks the boy's permission to marry his mother, and are elated to find the boy approves. Then we observe as he develops into a know-it-all at the seminary, and later his parents meet with him and let him know they will be leaving him to go live in America. Awesome. Why do we care when we bought a movie to learn about Mendel?

Terrible acting. No one has mentioned that the woman with the majority of screen time (the princess Hanna von Limburg) is DUBBED the entire move.  Her lines are consistently out of sync with her lips, and because she has so much screen time, it's distracting imagining why this was done. But really, this is a tiny problem.

And then out of no where we learn that Mendel has a problem with ""taxation."" I kept thinking they were insinuating Mendel had gotten behind on his taxes or something. Nothing is explained. And then he meets with the pope about it during a lovely vacation in Rome with the princess.

The scene with the parliament that other reviewers have mentioned was not in our copy of the dvd.

Obviously I'm pretty frustrated with this movie. Mostly because my mom spent money on it and we feel ripped off. I don't know how other reviewers could give this movie 5 stars and recommend it to friends. I would only suggest it to someone for some sad laughs. I can't emphasize enough that this movie is not about Mendel, but about the princess and her self-righteous hard-on for him. And inexplicably her husband's son. The only thing I learned about Mendel was that he was a sexy sexy priest who knew how to ""penetrate women deeply"" in their souls. NOT KIDDING THAT LINE IS IN THE MOVIE. The word ""penetrate"" was used at least 3 times in as many sentences.",1403308800,3,4138,4.71606648199446
6068310,5,B00GA8Z0B0,"This is a sensitive and inspiring film for the priests. I appreciated the in-depth knowledge of the priestly vocations, at all ages. Priests face challenges and temptations every day and this film not only describes them with delicacy but it offers a good example with Mendels holiness.
The struggle that is his life, between being a visionary scientist and a good priest, is great. It seems that the film is made more for the priests than for everybody else. Mendel's relationship with the clergy and the lay people; his answer to some woman's attempts of seduction; his testimony concerning the priestly commitment of the celibacy; his fear regarding the implications of his discovery: all these make him a very special character. The music,  the costumes and the locations are exquisite.
Ill offer the DVDs of this film as a gift to my friends priests, it is inspiring.",1403308800,,872,4.931972789115647
6068311,5,B00GA8Z0B0,"this movie is a great effort to show the spiritual, scientific and social dimension of Fr. Mendel, a very interesting plot about the father of genetics, opening our minds and hearts to see what faith can do, even as a social and scientific agent. We should watch more movies like this one, it could help us to get closer to truth, in a society that hides us the beautiful things and inspirations of believers and people of good will.

6068312,5,B00GA8Z0B0,"I watched the film as soon as I received it from Amazon and I was captured by Fr Mendel's struggle. Being a priest and a scientist was not easy. His spiritual father is a wonderful character and I liked Pius IX as well.
I loved the script. The author knows how to describe a priestly vocation. I work with vocations and I know it is not easy to define this state of grace. The two women and the conversion of the ""temptress"" illustrate quite well similar situations that take place nowadays too. In all the parishes are women like that and all the priests have to deal with similar situations and difficulties. The film has a double educational value: first of all because it resumes the daily life of a priest. And also because it explains in an accessible way how one of the most important scientific discoveries has been made.
The beautiful music, the actors' quality and the costumes made of this film a wonderful film. I will suggest it to my friends.",1400112000,8,956,4.5

-Has little to do with Mendell
-No chapters whatsoever
-Has a storyline leaving much to be expexted
-My grandmother complained in the end that in order to get to the good part (The part that actually involves Mendell's research) we had to watch a bunch of crap.

6068316,1,B00GA8Z0B0,"At times I felt like I was watching a very bad high school play.  I wanted to see Mendel in the lab or garden, researching & experimenting and (Hello!) saying mass!!!  Instead we see very little of him at all and only hear him TALKING about his ""discovery."" Next to the sophomoric acting, the most irritating thing for me was the disjointed story.  The movie begins with a series of irritating vignettes in which we meet several characters who will turn out to be peripheral in Fr. Mendel's life.  However, character after character is introduced to us without names, locations, or any other explanation as to who they are or how they relate to the SUPPOSED subject of the film.  Total waste of my 20 bucks!  Shame on Ignatius Press!",1396137600,7,733,4.6
8621567,5,B00GA8Z0B0,"Father Mendel was given by God the gift of being a priest and a scientist. He understood fully his role to be a good priest but at the same time he was keen on studying science and hoped his discoveries could help humanity. He struggled for his dual roles but later was enlightened by a good friend of his, a Father as well and his confidence was strengthened by the Pope at their final meeting in the movie. The first time I watched Christopher Lambert play the priest role was ""To Kill a Priest"" .This time he played Father Mendel in a peaceful manner and the background music is beautiful and tranquil. It is a pity that there are neither English subtitles nor menu provided for this movie. Otherwise, it would be even more enjoyable to watch.",1515196800,,746,4.452554744525547

This story needs to be retold highlighting and centering on how cool Mendel and his achievments were.

I loved the way Christopher Lambert gave life to Father Mendel in this film. The struggle between the scientist and the priest is very well described. Thanks to this film, I learned a lot about the priests scientists. Pius IX also is very well depicted. It is a good script and a good film, I hope to see more films like this.

A good priest
The priests have nowadays the same problems as then. Women or success can remove a priest from his vocation. Only the consciousness of the temptations and the ability to manage them can help the priest to remain firmly anchored to his call. This film shows very well the difficulty of being a priest, then as today. I liked the character of the princess, her wisdom and delicacy in helping Erica to become a good Catholic. The film is well done, the music is wonderful and the characters well written. I will offer this film as a gift to my priest. I recommend it to everybody.",1405296000,,934,4.430232558139535
