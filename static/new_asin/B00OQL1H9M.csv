8684494,5,B00OQL1H9M,The story of Janelle Morrison is an inspiring one for anyone looking to overcome obstacles in their life. This story is well put together with interviews Wong with day to day documentation of Janelle's journey. This film does a good job of capturing the grit is takes to succeed at the highest level of the triathlon world while simultaneously making an extraordinary physical comeback.,1476489600,,386,5.046875

8684496,4,B00OQL1H9M,"Good real life story for patients and their families to give them Hope and Strength to deal with Recovery issues but some aspects are missing like the need for good Healthy Nutritions! More details and credits to people (how so?) who supported her recovery! If her accident happens in a third word country, she may have died, seriously handicapped for life already! For people who care about Spiritual aspect of Recovery, some important missing Elements are God, Faith, Supporting Small Groups, Bible Studies and Prayers and to find out what ""Our Purpose Here On Earth"" (Some good reference will be reading the books ""Purpose Driven Life"" & the ""Celebrate Recovery Bible"" by Rick Warren)!",1463529600,,688,5.043859649122807
8684497,3,B00OQL1H9M,"I bought at first a used (rated supposedly as good and new) DVD, but it turn out coming with a broken DVD box, scratch Disc with small ring in the middle, and worst of all it will not play at around 20 mins mark! I am very disappointed! (So beware of used product!) :(
I finally bought the Online HD version of the movie. Good real life story for patients and their families to give them Hope and Strength to deal with Recovery issues but some important aspects are missing like the need for good Healthy Nutritions and a more details in all the Supporting People and Coaches for her recovery! For people who care about Spiritual aspect of Recovery, some important missing Elements are God, Faith, Supporting Small Groups, Bible Studies and Prayers and to find out what ""Our Purpose Here On Earth"" (Some good reference will be reading the books ""Purpose Driven Life"" & the ""Celebrate Recovery Bible"" by Rick Warren)!",1463443200,,916,4.625766871165644
