8197671,1,B000QUU4S2,"I am a relative beginner to yoga, so I guess I am probably in the target audience.  However, absolutely nothing on preview drew me in and made me want to try the workout. The background was very blah, the music was barely audible, it did not hold my attention.",1195862400,3,260,4.3061224489795915
8197672,5,B000QUU4S2,"If you are looking for a beginner workout with a few intermediate challenges, then Real World Yoga might work for you. You won't be required to twist into any pretzel shapes and there are three levels for each of the exercises. This is perfect for beginners because the pace is slower and Jackie Camborde's nurturing teaching style explains all the poses in depth. Since she takes the time to explain each posture this may be frustrating for advanced practitioners.

The practice begins with gentle stretches and then progresses into vinyasa-style exercises. In 48 minutes you will experience:

Mountain Pose
Downward Facing Dog
Child's Pose
Plank
Lunges
Cobra
Upward Facing Dog
Warrior 1 and 2
Reverse Warrior
Chair Pose
Cat/Cow
Back Bends
Extended Side Angle Pose
Spinal Twists

The caring cueing makes the exercises fun and the precise instruction keeps you on track. Jackie Camborde's vibrant personality adds energy to the practice. This workout also includes a four minute guided relaxation to make sure you are totally relaxed and ready to face the day with a positive outlook.
