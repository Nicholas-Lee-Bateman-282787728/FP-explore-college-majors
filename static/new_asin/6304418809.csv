7870835,1,6304418809,"I was very dissapointed with the quality of the VHS that I ordered from Amazon.ca. Children cannot learn anything from this tape. The presentation is very poor. As soon as I watched it I was ready to send it back. Unfortunately, Amazon.ca does not accept opened VHS tapes. They accept damaged and unopened items. But what about the products that do not satisfy customers. Because you don't know what you bought, until you open and actually see it. I would not recommend this tape.
I ordered two tapes. The other one, ""Discover Bellydance"" (Basic Dance) by Veena and Neena, is an excellent and colourful performace, easy to follow for both children and grown-ups. I would give 5+ stars to this tape.",1074470400,10,698,4.776859504132231
7870836,2,6304418809,"I am (very) surprised at the number of positive reviews this vido has recieved. My 6 yr old is in beginner ballet and loves it. But this tape couldn't hold her attention for more than 5 minutes! The dance instructor has such a heavy accent, it's near impossible to understand her. What WAS understood wasn't spoken loud enough, my tv was at top volume. She is not upbeat at all and acts like she wasn't paid enought to make this video. Her attitude and tone of voice is all the same- dull. I am annoyed at amazon for recommending this. I will be dropping it off in the nearest goodwill box.",1073952000,14,590,4.324324324324325
7870837,5,6304418809,"After seeing so many choices of ballet teaching videos on Amazon, I consulted my local library and was able to borrow this one.  We found it charming and fun (our daughter takes a weekly hour long 5-6 yr old ballet/jazz combo class although ballet is her favorite).  The instructor is pleasant and clearly describes the moves as she is doing them with the ""class"".  I must note here that I have already purchased the ""Learn Nutcracker Dances with Me"" and although it's nice, it seemed more like a home movie done by someone who likes to ham it up with filming effects.  This video (How to Be...) is very easy to follow and, while it is NOT a source for basic technique learning, it does a wonderful job at giving children some fun ballet skits to put together from rehersal to performance.  We also enjoyed the final performance at the end.  If in doubt about this choice- call your local library and try it for free.  I plan to purchase this one and the Royal Ballet's Sleeping Beauty DVD for our collection.",1037577600,35,1009,4.510989010989011
7870838,2,6304418809,"I was amazed at the other reveiws giving this video such good marks. My four year old watched it twice. She had attended a dance class proir to a move and loved the circle work, foot work and stuff for preschool age. This was no where near what I thought it would be. I would not waste my money. I would love a refferal for a good one! As my daughter loves to dance.",1035936000,14,366,3.9594594594594597
7870839,5,6304418809,"My 1 1/2 year old and 4 year old daughters both adore this charming video filmed in England.  They're usually zombie couch potatoes if the TV is on, but not for this movie!  They run to put on their ""dress up"" leotards and tutus, and follow along as best they can, dancing all over the room.  It's too darn cute for words.
By the way, my 4 year old tried, but didn't like, attending a ballet class. It was too hard for her. I think the repetition of viewing the video over and over makes it easier to learn.  Not that a movie can replace real lessons, of course, but we'll wait until she's a little older to try it again.",1024012800,4,621,4.107438016528926
7870840,1,6304418809,"I ordered this because my daughter has recently been enrolled in a Ballet class.  She gushes with excitement after each session and my wife and I thought an at-home practice video might be entertaining.
The reviews for this product rave about how wonderful the 45-minute video is and how their children enjoyed it. I am amazed at this claim.  The tape does not go through the basic steps like a dance class and only focuses on a series of mediocre dance routines.
My daughter was bored within minutes and repeated viewings have fared no better.  We ordered this in the hopes that it would be a nice entertaining primer on ballet for our little girl. The product description is vague enough to convince the unwitting consumer that this is what the tape contains. This is not the case.  It is a 45-minute glimpse into a ballet class preparing for a program.  It is not for the parent wanting to give their daughter a tape to practice her basic steps with.
Avoid this tape at your peril. It is a waste of money and time and won't help aspiring Ballerinas do anything more than get up and go outside to play soccer.",1022716800,10,1111,4.507462686567164
7870841,5,6304418809,"My three-year-old daughter started participating almost immediately.  Sleeping Beauty is one of her favorite stories,  and all the steps taught are easy for kids to imitate.  Even the ones she couldn't do, she was able  to copy to some degree so that she felt like she was really dancing like  the girls on TV. The video held her attention the whole way through, and  I'm sure we will play it over and over.",944352000,27,407,4.506849315068493
7870842,5,6304418809,"My toddler started watching this video at 18 months ... now at 27 months I actually think I have to buy another one becuase it is getting so worn!!  The Instructor is very nice, clear and obviously loves both dance and small  children.  What she teaches is truly good - and in a manner easy for small  children to follow, although it certainly is not a replacement for formal  instruction - but she doesn't mean it to be ... it is to get the children  interested -- and IT SUCCEEDS!!  My daughter's FAVORITE thing is to watch  this video ... and I like it because not only is it good, it means I can  sit for 20 minutes!",939686400,37,620,4.186440677966102
