5403963,5,B00AADAEHQ,"To all PETTICOAT JUNCTION fans,

What a treat to learn that a new PETTICOAT JUNCTION DVD is being released!!!!  RETURN TO HOOTERVILLE is a 50th Anniversary tribute to one of the most beloved and well acted sitcoms from what I consider the true golden age of television, the 1960s.  There promises to be behind-the-scenes materials, cast interviews, and promotional appearance video.  This is a 50 year anniversary gift to all PETTICOAT JUNCTION fans!

Let's hope the fabulous Linda Kaye Henning, who played Betty Jo for the entire 7 season run, adds her informative and interesting commentary to this new release like she did with the OFFICIAL SEASON 1 and 2 DVDs.

Ever since the OFFICIAL SEASON 2 PETTICOAT JUNCTION DVD was released in 2009 I have been checking frequently for the release dates of SEASONS 3-7.  Let's all write CBS / VIACOM and demand that they release the other seasons of one of the greatest television programs from the 1960s!!!

There is no place like the good ole Shady Rest!

trivia; and how they feel about living between Pixley and Hooterville. Image living in a town
with THOSE names without laughing! I REALLY, really, REALLY recommend this item and all
three O-F-F-I-CI-A-L seasons [so they're complete, unedited, and have the original music]!

Really nice bits 'n' pieces, nice to see clips about the dog that later became BENJI, but...
where's seasons 4-7?
Yeah, I've read ALL about it:
1.) = Linda Kaye Henning (Betty Jo), who was married to her TV-husband and---in REAL-life
---owns The Henning Family Estate copyrights, hates HER ex-spouse [more than I hate MINE]
doesn't want to have to pay H-I-M any residual-fees for being reminded about the REEL-life
story-line of their dating, marriage, and the birth of their reel/real-life child.
2.) = Story-lines are depressing in seasons 4 and 5 because the older folks on the series be-
gin dying one-by-one ([heck!]""Betty Jo"" was played by the youngest, regular cast, actress...
and, Linda Kaye Henning'll be 71 in just a few weeks [seventy-one!]) OMG! I had a crush on
""Betty-Jo"" when I was in highschool, and I'LL be 67 next year.
3.) Bea Benaderet (1906-1968) died from a 5-pack-a-day habit, and, literally, phoned-in a few
appearances via a letter-reading; and as-spoken from the perspective of the back of a stand-in.
4.) The Cannonball conductor and engineer fade into the sunset...

5404045,4,B00AADAEHQ,"As a fan, I found ""Return to Hooterville"" worthwhile and informative, yet disappointing in one particular area.  Before getting into details of my ONE disappointment, I must say I agree with all the 5-Star Reviews here that the DVD is done very well, packed with great stuff, and worth getting if you are a fan of the show.

Linda Kaye Henning hosts the program and does a great job covering most of the regulars and frequent guests on the show.  Its too bad that Jeanine Riley (Billie-Jo No. 1), Pat Woodall (Bobbie-Jo NO. 1), and June Lockhart (live-in Doctor to replace loss of Kate Bradley) are not included in the interviews.

Also greatly missed is some due mention of Meredith MacRae (as Billie-Jo Bradley No. 3 appearing in the final 4 seasons)for her contribution to the show.  Meredith died in 2000 from complications of brain cancer.  Meredith played Billie-Jo longer (4 years) than Jeannine Riley and Gunilla Hutton combined (3 years total).  Rather than play a blonde bimbo, she had the talent and boldness to bring depth to the character, much the same way Lori Saunders gave her personal touch to the Bobbi-Jo character.  To me, this version of the 3 Bradley sisters ""jelled"" as a family.  My favorite seasons are the final 4 with Meredith MacRae and Mike Minor added to the line-up.  It is fortunate that they were brought in at that time because Petticoat Junction soon lost Smiley Burnette and then Bea Benaderet and finally Rufe Davis.  While they lost the great talents of these actors, the music weaved into the storyline helped to keep the close-knit family feel of the show and make it even more entertaining.  The DVD includes a music video for the song ""Wheeling West Virginia"" by ""The Girls From Petticoat Junction - Sixties Sounds""(a 2011 CD release with songs by Linda, Lori, & Meredith).  Still, I am baffled as to why Meredith is barely mentioned on this DVD.  There is no mention of Meredith's cancer death in 2000 other than her name included at the end credits ""in Memory of"" with the others who are no longer with us at the time of this DVD release.  Linda Kaye Henning only mentions Meredith in passing as the final actor to play Billie-Jo replacing Gunilla Hutton.  Were there copyright issues?  Was it an oversight on somebody's part?  Fortunately, Mike Minor and Gunilla Hutton had a few things to say about Meredith in the context of their interviews.  If there is a valid reason for Meredith MacRae being overlooked in this anniversary video, I'd like to know what it is.",1393545600,2,2511,4.731034482758621
5404046,4,B00AADAEHQ,"PETTICOAT JUNCTION-RETURN TO HOOTERVILLE: Creator PAUL HENNING's laid back rural sitcom took place in the whistle stop town of HOOTERVILLE, home of the SHADY REST, a comfy, down home hotel accessible only by way of an archaic locomotive affectionately known as THE CANNONBALL. Run by no nonsense widow KATE BRADLEY (BEA ""BETTY RUBBLE"" BENEDERET) and slow movin', fast talkin' UNCLE JOE (played to perfection by character actor EDGAR BUCHANAN), this precursor to today's ""bed and breakfast"" often housed more employees than visitors. Much of the show's gentle humor derived from UNCLE JOE's lame brained get rich quick schemes, the family's LASSIE smart pooch and KATE's three nearly grown daughters, blonde BILLIE JO (portrayed by three actresses, including two future HEE HAW HONEYS and MEREDITH MACCRAE), brunette BOBBIE JO (PAT WOODELL, then LORI SAUNDERS) and redheaded BETTY JO (HENNING's daughter LINDA KAYE). Neither as over the top as THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES nor as surreal as GREEN ACRES, HENNING's other sixties smashes, PETTICOAT JUNCTION proved the perfect place to stop and put your feet up for seven sublime seasons.

RETURN TO HOOTERVILLE is a nicely done, nostalgic documentary hosted by LINDA KAYE HENNING; the many extras include a warm tribute to BEA BENEDERET by her son actor JACK BANNON, her guest star shot on THE DANNY KAYE SHOW and a behind the scenes look at THE CANNONBALL.

The most heart-touching part for me was the segment with Jack Bannon.  The lovely pictures of the matriarch and star of Petticoat Junction and his high-praise comments and memories of his very talented mother Bea Benaderet were totally priceless.  I also enjoyed the outtakes & stock outdoor footage-you would have NEVER thought those scenes were shot in California. They look as if it could be from Anywhere Rural USA-this and much more is why this rural gem is so endeared by all who watch it.  I am hoping that as the first two seasons in B&W have been properly released that all the color seasons will be officially released with the permission from the Estate of Mr. Henning.

I enjoy listening to Bea Benaderet on various old radio shows that Paul Henning also had a hand in writing and of course, she was such a very talented woman and never have I heard her come out with an off-colored line, of which Norman Lear and all of his junk that he has given us starting in the 70's, has come up with to destroy T.V. viewing for the past 40 years. CBS had so much going for it and to take all of these great shows off of the air was lunacy to say the least. This DVD does have so much on it and it is enjoyable to watch. I didn't care for the music on Benji (Higgins) so I just fast forward it and I didn't miss anything and the music tracks I just skipped over, otherwise, everything else I enjoyed, even some of the commercials of which I have a deep hatred for. I think that the fans of Petticoat will enjoy this DVD and it does have the Christmas show on it.

Also of note is the interview with Bea Benaderet's son Jack Bannon who gives insight into his mother and his own time on the show. I just wish Pat Woodell and Jeannine Riley had appeared to share their memories.

Best of all is the behind-the-scenes footage they shot for Season 3's opening titles, including the water tower scene (although I wish it was longer and there had been more of it).

I hope this disc sells because I would love CBS to continue the season sets on DVD (or license them out to an independent label). Seasons 3 and 4 were among the best of the series and they need to come out soon.

Linda Kaye Henning also comes off as anything but a typical ""actress"" - she seems more like a friendly lady you'd meet in the community.

5404108,5,B00AADAEHQ,"thanks to this great dvd i feel like i've been treated to a trip to the shady rest via the cannonball. they just don't make shows like pj anymore. this documentary covers so many interesting topics including a special bio of dog, otherwise known as higgins, that made me cry since we lost our dog in recent years. also included are bea benaderet's guest appearance on the danny kaye show, which my husband loved, and her radio interview with lucille ball. a game show called the perfect match is on this dvd because linda kaye henning was a contestant on it, and she and husband-to-be mike minor chat with the l.a. talk show host keene on his show. there is a music video of linda and her ""sisters"" lori and meredith, and of course wonderful old commercials. there is also stock footage that was never used in pj episodes and much much more. the only thing we need now are more season releases. my favorite is season 3 and i would buy it instantly if it came out.",1363824000,4,963,4.415730337078652
5404109,4,B00AADAEHQ,"This came in perfect condition thanks to amazon and right on time. Some  of the material has been seen before. The best part was the out take sections but Lindas dialog was a bit repetitive. At the end of this segment was an offer for a book on the series from bear manor media. I just hope this book does come out because all the fans of the show have been waiting since 1998 for this. I will not mention any names. The disc is of good quality and the girls were beautiful.
It would have been nice to see more footage of them actually filming the episodes. Lets hope season 3 comes out on 9/24/13- the 50th anniversary date. In the meantime-enjoy this.",1363737600,2,653,4.266129032258065
5404110,5,B00AADAEHQ,"Admittedly, this compilation does contain some previously released segments, but the new stuff is well worth the asking price.  Since I'm a devout Bea Benaderet fan, I was ecstatic to finally see her guest appearance on THE DANNY KAYE SHOW.  Bea worked so much on regular series like BURNS & ALLEN, PETER LOVES MARY, BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, and PETTICOAT JUNCTION that it was very rare for her to appear as a guest star on any other series.  Exceptions are her appearances in TV shows from the 1959-60 and 1961-62 seasons and this guest shot on DANNY KAYE.  The neat thing about her appearance on the KAYE show is that by this point she was quite recognizable as the star (finally!) of her own show.  You'll love her as Kaye's pushy Brooklynese mother in one skit and as his zany Southern wife in another...""Mayberry"" fans will be delighted to see both Jim Nabors and Andy Griffith in the latter sketch.  Equally important is Bea's radio interview (two-part, audio only, of course) with Lucille Ball on Ball's 1964 radio show, something else I've waited years to hear.  There's a brief video clip from the ART LINKLETTER SHOW, which has been previously released, and I still wonder why it ends so abruptly.  There has to be more from this show??  Especially touching and rare is a segment featuring a current interview with Jack Bannon, Bea's son, who reminisces about her, PJ, and the cast.  As he speaks, various clips and still photos are shown, including rare (evidently from Bannon's collection) photos of a brunette Bea from the 1920s-1940s.  Jim Pierson does a great job guiding the conversation between Linda Henning and himself in a segment showing out takes from the show, mostly shots of the real train, taken on location in Jamestown, CA.  I'm so happy that Bea is getting some recognition, just wondering why her image was not on the cover?",1363564800,3,1850,4.783018867924528
5404111,4,B00AADAEHQ,"People who remember Petticoat Junction or have never sampled the show may be disappointed by the contents as their is only one complete episode and few (if any) clips outside the first two seasons. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD mainly because I grew up with a crush on Linda Henning who still looks great after all these years. In addition to fondly recalling the program and her career with it, she is represented by appearances on three other shows, including a dance number celebrating famous Hollywood musicals. Bea Benedaret, Edgar Buchanan, Charles Lane, etc. are all justifiably praised for their comedic timing, friendship, and professionalism. The various interviews also explain a few questions I've always had about the show: was Steve Elliott originally intended to wed oldest daughter (Billie Jo) rather than youngest, why were the settings of Petticoat Junction and Green Acres so different despite both taking place in Hooterville, why Guinilla Hutton quit so suddenly, etc.

In fact, the only REAL disappointment I had was the advertisement for a companion RETURN TO HOOTERVILLE book published by Bearmanor Media. Unfortunately there's no mention of the book on the company's website, not even in blog for forthcoming titles. :(

So I'd say this DVD is really for fans of PJ (and Linda Henning and Bea Benedaret) who already have episodes in their collection to watch. Hopefully the remastered official seasons, too. :)",1363564800,14,1445,5.170940170940171
5404112,5,B00AADAEHQ,"Come ride the little train that is rolling down the tracks to the Junction! If you are a fan of Petticoat Junction, this disc is a must have. It contains material you would be hard pressed to find or learn about on the internet and many rarities about the show that will definitely pique your interest. It starts off with a detailed documentary giving you a good history of the show, with insight from Linda Kaye Henning, Lori Saunders, Gunilla Hutton, Frank Cady, Mike Minor and others. It runs about an hour and its very entertaining and informative. Then there are the Bonus Features. They have a commercial collection showing cast members pitching products like Tide Detergent and Ivory Soap which probably haven't been seen by the public for 50 years and are not available to view on Youtube or other online video sites. Then they have a production/stock footage collection which shows you different footage they shot when filming the show and if you a fan of the show, you must see it to believe it. They show stock footage of the Hooterville Cannonball and talk about historical elements it has, they have footage of Higgins the Dog and what he did behind the scenes and different footage of the Bradley Sisters from the Opening Credits in the Watertower to the Ending Credits behind the Train Bench. They show extended images of the Shady Rest Set and miniature models they used to transition scenes. It is very cool and worth the purchase alone. They also included the original CBS Promo Spots and much much more. There is only one episode of the Show itself, which is the Rare Cannonball Christmas Episode, which is most likely going to become a tradition to watch at my house at the holidays along with White Christmas and It's a Wonderful Life. In summary, it is a desirable collection for a fan of Petticoat Junction and anybody who is a fan of Classic Television, I can highly recommend it and say you will enjoy it.",1363478400,3,1930,4.6627565982404695
5404113,5,B00AADAEHQ,"Now here's a real treat: Over 3 hours of behind-the-scenes documentaries, interviews, archival footage, outtakes and more about the fondly-remembered series Petticoat Junction.  MPI Home Video deserves some kind of an award for their efforts here.  Just the main documentary, ""The History of Hooterville"" (approx. 50 min.) is worth the price of admission.  It includes interviews with pretty much all the stars who are still alive (including the recently-deceased Frank Cady), and lots of great stories about the show's production.  Linda Kaye Henning gets the most screen time, and has plenty to say about her famous father's show.  Gunilla Hutton painfully admits that giving up the role of Billie Jo after only one season was a huge mistake.  And the casts' praise of Bea Benaderet is unanimous and heartwarming.

But that's only the beginning of this fully-loaded tribute to the show.  Linda and DVD producer Jim Pierson narrate about 20 minutes of unused footage, including some great shots of the Cannonball (both the real train and the miniature version. . .although you'll quickly tire of Henning proclaim them both ""so cute!"").  ""The Girls of Petticoat Junction"" music video offers a real slice of 60's nostalgia.  There are plenty of cast commercials--how can you not love Kate Bradley advising her daughters on the best way to catch a man are by using Ivory soap and Tide detergent?  Priceless!  There are also what I assume are some rare t.v. appearances by Henning and Benedaret, including spots on various talk shows from the late 60's.  And for you Higgins the dog lovers, there's a featurette on the canine who would (as Linda Henning candidly states) outshine all his human co-stars as Benji.

And if all that wasn't enough, there's also one of my personal favorite episodes in its entirety (with a new on-screen intro by Henning), ""A Cannonball Christmas.""  Of course, the faithful fans already have it, as well as some of the sponsor spots, on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Petticoat-Junction-The-Official-First-Season/dp/B001E6JC30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Petticoat Junction -  The Official First Season</a>.  Which brings me to another point worth mentioning.  Although this excellent DVD was produced by MPI, the rights to the individual episodes still belong to CBS/Paramount.  And as any true fan can tell you, they stopped releasing season sets after only 2 seasons, the last of which was way back in 2009.  I hope this DVD well be a big seller, and either CBS/Paramount will take notice of that fact and get back on the ball, or maybe MPI can get the rights from them and give the seasons sets the same amount of care they put into this collection.

Until then, though, anyone with even a casual interest in Petticoat Junction must have this lovingly-prepared disc.  Place your order now, and at such an attractive price, maybe buy an extra copy to give as a gift?  Highly recommended.",1363046400,54,2959,5.235668789808917
5404114,5,B00AADAEHQ,"Wow - this is an amazing disc.  Warning:  if you want actual episodes, it only contains one (the first year Christmas Show).  This disc is a kind of ""extra"" disc.  It has over about 15 different things ranging from Bea on The Danny Kaye Show to a film tribute to Higgins (later known as Bengi).  Included are a radio show with Lucille Ball interviewing Bea Benaderet (!), a 20 min doc with Linda Kay Henning commenting on archival backstage shot footage, Linda & Mike Minor on an interview TV Show.  A few of the extras I had seen on the Season one or two packs, but gotta say that this disc was just loaded with so many interesting things it is for sure worth getting, especially you loved the show.",1363046400,30,700,4.346153846153846
