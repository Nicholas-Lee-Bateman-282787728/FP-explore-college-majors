8620376,4,B00G3DLVFQ,"""On My Way"" (2013 release from France; 113 min.; original title ""Elle S'en Va"") brings the story of Bettie (played by Catherine Deneuve), a sixty-something widow who runs a small restaurant somewhere in Bretagne. Things are not well with Bettie: the restaurant is barely surviving, and her love life is in tatters. One afternoon, Bettie leaves the restaurant, on the pretense of getting some cigarettes, but instead Bettie hits the road. In a separate but parallel story line, Bettie's daughter Muriel, a single mom, has a job offer in faraway Brussels, and can Bettie pick up Charly, Muriel's 11 yr. old son, and take him to Charly's grandfather (on Charly's dad's side). Bettie reluctantly agrees. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is written and directed by French actress/director Emmanuelle Bercot, specifically with Catherine Deneuve in mind for the role of Bettie. Second, I have seen many movies of Catherine Deneuve, and this is yet again a top notch acting performance. Hard to believe that she is 69 years when this was filmed! It comes as no surprise that this role netted her yet another, the umpteenth, nomination for Cezar Best Actress (the Oscar equivalent in France). But kudos as well to newcomer Nemo Schiffman who is outstanding as the 11 yr. old boy. Third, a good chunk of the movie plays out like a true road movie, French style of course. The movie takes us on the back roads of various regions in France, including of course Bretagne, but also the Loire region, and Haute-Savoie. Last but certainly not least, while there is a good amount of ""family drama"", the movie is also an ode to life in rural France that is becoming more and more out of reach or simply disappearing. Check out the long scene where the entire family is having dinner outside. So French!

Bottom line: this movie is an unexpected pleasure which I enjoyed from start to finish. This movie showed up this weekend without any pre-release hype or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I figure this won't play long so I went to see it right away. The matin&eacute;e screening where I saw this at today was better attended than I had expected. If you are in the mood for a top quality foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, and where you get to watch one of the top actresses of this generation, by all means, don't miss this, be it in the theater or on DVD/Bly-ray. ""Elle S'en Va"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1396137600,3,2584,4.714601769911504
