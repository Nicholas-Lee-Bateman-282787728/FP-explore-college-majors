6925892,5,B00RCPFF06,"I usually don't watch much TV, but I happened to catch a couple of re runs of this show and was so impressed, I just had to have the complete set on DVD.  My experiences are limited to vivid dreams of loved ones who have passed on, but this show will make you at least consider the possibilities of what could be.  I am currently on the 4th season with one more season to go and I just love every episode so far.  Buy this set!  You won't be sorry!",1292284800,37,448,3.9444444444444446

6925901,1,B00RCPFF06,Was extremely disappointed with DVD box. Supposed to be new and slip box looked worn and plastic binding for DVDs was cracked-terrible. I was expecting a NEW DVD collection and feel I was ripped off.,1528329600,,199,4.714285714285714

6925903,3,B00RCPFF06,"I only gave it 3 stars because there is no sub titles for hard of hearing.  I know it didn't list it in the description, but I was hoping that in this day and age that it had that feature.  I have dvd's of movies made in the '40's that have that feature.  Oh, well. just turn it up loud.",1528156800,,287,3.75
6925904,5,B00RCPFF06,"Ghost Whisperer (Complete Series) benefits from the attractive personality and engaging performance of Jennifer Love Hewitt, a clever premise, and uniformly excellent writing. The anchor of the story for 5 seasons is the totally loyal partnership of young married couple Melinda Gordon and Jim Clancy. It's a pleasure to watch the deeply loving couple remain supportive, faithful and positive in their relationship no matter what ghostly challenge is thrown at them. It's particularly fresh that the series begins with husband Jim already accepting of Melinda's supernatural ability.

I bought the 5 season complete package. I checked the first several discs and they work fine. The subtitles also work - - contrary to a previous review -- though not all seasons have them.

The stories are neither too light nor too heavy, finding a nice balance between an occasional scare and some really sweet interactions between Melinda, her ghosts, and the family and friends of those who need to find their way into the light but have unfinished business first. The supporting cast is appealing, with Jay Mohr being a standout for me, though all, including guest stars, deserving of an honorable mention.

Jennifer Love transmits her feelings authentically in stories that need earnestness, and she in particular is called upon to cry at the end of most episodes, since they often finish with a deceased loved one ""going into the light."" In any other show so much crying simply could not work, but the surprise for me is that these endings are quite honestly believable because these story endings actually call for this kind of response. I do marvel that Jennifer Love is able to call up these strong emotions on such a frequent basis, and with great authenticity. I can't swear no glycerin is involved, but I can say it doesn't seem so.

This is an affecting series, which again is a rare undying love story, and at the same time an enjoyable series of stories that had me looking forward to every episode from start to finish. There could have been more than 5 seasons quite easily, and in fact the cast could return and do a very nice additional turn (or more) down the road, particularly since Ms Hewitt was an executive producer and also directed on this series. What a gal!",1527724800,,2271,4.890909090909091

6925927,5,B00RCPFF06,"I have to admit that when this show was actually on TV, I never watched it, Not even a single episode. However, today, I am so tired of the shows they are airing so I took a chance and bought the complete series. To my surprised, I am floored. The show caught my attention from episode 1 and I have been marathon watching it ever since. The characters are relatable and the ghosts are endearing yet sometimes edgy. This is one of those shows that should be brought back rather then so many superhero fluff or cop shows that are always the same story lines over and over. I highly recommend this series for those who have a wider scope and aren't so narrowminded",1517097600,9,661,4.338709677419355
6925928,1,B00RCPFF06,I am beyond pissed. I love this show and was excited to get it in the mail and start watching this show again. I opened the box pulled put the case for seasons 1-4 and disks started falling out. The prongs holding them in were broke. I took out the final season to see how that was and immediately saw plastic broke. In the bottom of the box. Flipped over the case and it was totally broke. The hinge was also broke holding those disks in that case also. I have never experienced any of this before. I will be returning.,1516924800,,520,4.158415841584159

6925950,5,B00RCPFF06,"I really like this show, it's in that same genre as charmed and medium in my opinion. The dvds themselves came in a nice big case for all the seasons except the final, which is in its own package. Doesn't bother me at all. Ive only watched one DVD so far, seems clear and the production value is there. My only issue is I hate when there is no ""play all"" option. Not a big deal but it's a pet peeve of mine and I don't understand why they wouldn't have that option on all dvds with multiple episodes. Anyway, well worth the money!",1500336000,4,530,4.105769230769231

6925956,4,B00RCPFF06,"The Show: Really enjoy this show. It's one of the shows on my middle bracket of the tv shows I watch. Basically a show I can watch a few episodes of at a time and I like the story lines and characters but it's not a favorite show that I want to watch over and over again and it's not a show I'll continually go back to. Glad I have it now in my collection on DVD.

Packaging: If this was a favorite show, the packaging would bother me a lot more than it does. The first 4 seasons are in 1 large DVD container/case and the last season is in its own separate DVD case. I like my dvd's of tv shows/movie series to be matching. However as I previously mentioned, it doesn't really bother me that much and when it's turned around all I see is the spine anyway.",1497657600,3,755,4.0
6925957,5,B00RCPFF06,"My wife and I watched this together. It is my second time watching the show and her first. Quality is perfect on audio and video. The menus are awesome as well and easy to navigate. I love the packaging as it fits all of season 1-4 in a simple clamshell and then a separate one for season 5. The case is very durable and has beautiful artwork. I would prefer this over the single seasons. Actually I traded in my single seasons to make way for this version and let me tell you, I am not disappointed.",1496016000,,500,4.164948453608248

But I do love a good ghost story and I thought I would enjoy this series.  I did, for the most part, up until they made too many cast changes.  They replaced or killed off some of the best characters and replaced them with lackluster, unappealing actors/characters.  In particular, toward the end of the series (and I am trying not to be too much of a spoiler here), they killed off one of the main characters, then brought him back in a way that was downright annoyingly silly.

6925997,4,B00RCPFF06,"I am only giving it a 4 star because seasons 1 - 4 are all packed as one set with all discs 4 per carrier (2 front & 2 back).  This mass cartridge hold is loose fitting & isn't constructed very well. Season 5 is sold separately as the finale. Had I known it was packaged this way I would have purchased the newer collection. I prefer each season in their individual jackets; if it doesn't matter to you how you get the 29 DVD's then order it.

6926016,4,B00RCPFF06,"SPOILER ALERT!!!
This was a wonderful concept, and a very enjoyable show to watch.  I was very disapointed in the story arch of season 4.  Like many other similar shows, they lost their fans due to this storyline, and probably got cancelled prematurely.  So many shows do very well the first few seasons, then ruin it.  Fringe, Warehouse 13, and 4400 were all awesome shows and should have gone on with the original concepts for many years, but they lose the fans when they come up with unlikable story archs.  After the story arch in season 4 of this show, I found myself losing interest in the show, because I wondered why the story didn't change to Melinda helping lost ghosts do the same thing as her husband.  I felt like I didn't believe in what she was doing anymore, because if it was good for all the others, why not him.  They never should have killed him off in the first place, but bringing him back in another body ruined the show.  We loved the fact that (for a change) they were a happy couple, who loved each other deeply.  When will they learn!!!",1466121600,3,1063,4.410256410256411

The story lines themselves were entertaining fiction but well enough done to overlook the hokey nature of it all. I would never have purchased the complete series on DVD were it not for my wife, who is clearly a much more involved fan than I. If her satisfaction of this package and all the included extra content is any measure of its quality then I must give a five star review.

6926222,5,B00RCPFF06,"I have had this show on my wish list for quite a while now. I used to watch it every Friday night and was so disappointed when it was cancelled.  If you have never seen it, it is about a woman that sees and talks to ghost.  Not only does she talk to them, but she helps the ghosts find closure so they can cross over to the light. This most of the time includes convincing family and loved ones that their passed ones are there.  The show does have a storyline.  She helps anyone from the young to old.  There is a couple times she encounters ghosts that aren't so nice, but she doesn't back down.
When I seen the box set available I convinced my husband we needed this in our collection.  It arrived fast and in great shape.  I plan on binge watching the entire series complete with popcorn!  I still hold on to the hope that they will somehow bring the show back, but until then I will watch these over and over and over again!",1427414400,,929,4.122222222222222

I bought this for my 17 yr old daughter twice (had to return one) so I guess that shows we were pretty excited to have it. Love this show and being able to watch episode after episode in order. We do not buy many complete series because of the cost but this is one that both of my daughters and I are excited to start watching (just about done with The Charmed series). Good acting (in my opinion) and a fun series to get into.

The issue is basically with subtitles. My girlfriend does not speak English; she is as well as me from Costa Rica. It was a terrible notice that no subtitles or alternative languages were included in this collection. That's why my bad review... If not a problem for you or for your latina..., Go and buy it.

Great Show! I hope you get this fixed soon and most probably I will re-buy it. It is not about money...

6926269,5,B00RCPFF06,"Ghost Whisperer has an interesting concept--far beyond just seeing ghosts.  It mixes the macabre with the sweet, the typical with the truly strange. In this show, ghosts are influenced by their reputation (of being a ghost), perhaps as much as their human lives.  Some want to try on the rep, others want to remain human, many want to help those they're leaving behind, and some want to live out their darkest fantasies at any cost.  It is a full range of story lines, which plays out a huge range of human ideals and desires.

The cast is great--always nice to have a strong, fearless female character who isn't mean and nasty to boot!  Nice to have a host of characters and actors with rich personalities and participation in the story to keep the mind working--and not so many that you need a white board to keep them all straight in your head.",1411084800,,847,4.546052631578948

The only complaint I have is the confusing tracking, shipped by DHL, DHL turns around and hands it off to USPS, and eventually it got to us in the mail.  When tracking from Amazon, you have to look up DHL Global Mail tracking, and from there, you click the tracking number which directs you to the USPS site to track.  Not a show stopper, but a pain in the rear end.  Other than that, seller shipped it pretty quick, and it came to us in great condition.",1359849600,,573,4.135135135135135

The packaging could be better , but it is in no no way bad , it`s just that such a perfect series needed a perfect display case/box.

Jennifer Love Hewitt and David Conrad , and the rest of the cast were perfectly cast , there is a sense a realism that not many series can pull-off as well as this one did.

The only regret I have is that there was no season 6 , as there was plenty of stories and souls left to cross over.

Jennifer Love Hewitt has brought to the small screen a story full of friendship and love. The actors act like we expect people who are in love should act. The ghosts actually go bump in the night, but the story lines always put a face on the ""scary"" so that you can understand why.

The actual picture quality is OUTSTANDING; clear and great color.  The writters of this series were right on Q, and made every minute of each episode exciting and fun to listen to.  The Direction of this series is above reproach.  I enjoy looking at all the clothing that is worn by the main characters, always changing, never the same, and really top quality and inviting.  I guess you can see I like this series.  I fell in love with it from Episode 1 (the pilot) and it gets better as you go along.  I watch two episodes daily, 5 days a week, and NO COMERCIALS.  This has been well worth the money for 107 top notch episodes that I can watch over and over.  This is a keeper for me that will be passed along to my next generations....and it goes along with my current readings about Near Death Experiences, so I get a double dose.

I CONTACTED THE SHIPPERS THROUGH A RELATIVE BECAUSE I HAD TEMP LOST MY INTERNET CONTCTIONS AND SHE ONLY KNEW OF THE FIRST SEASON AT THE TIME BECAUSE WERE WERE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF WATCHING THEM AND WE WERE SHIPPED ANOTHER FIRST SEASON, HOWEVER THAT ONE TOO HAD FROZE UP AND GLITCHED TO THE POINT WHERE IT ALSO STOPPED WORKING IN THE PILOT SHOW TOO, (A DIFFERENT PLACE IN THE PILOT BUT STILL IT WAS IN THE PILOT) AND I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET MY RELATIVE TO CONTACT THE SHIPPER BACK AND NOW I WILL HAVE TO DO IT BUT I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO UNTIL NOW AND I EITHER WANT A GOOD COPY OR MY MONEY BACK. AS THE SHIPPER APPERENTLY DOESNT HAVE A SINGLE COPY OF THE SHOW WITHOUT IT BEING BAD.  THIS IS HOW I RATE THIS PRODUCT/ SHIPPER. THE SHOW ITSELF IS GOOD BUT THE DISCS ARE BAD.

6926406,5,B00RCPFF06,The Ghost Whisperer series is excellent entertainment. We really enjoyed watching a couple episodes each evening. Having purchased the complete series pack we were able to watch the entire series without a long wait between seasons. This series was definitely a good investment and one I'd highly recommend to others.,1314489600,10,317,5.36
6926407,1,B00RCPFF06,"I've watch this on TV and it has closed captioned but when I received the DVD series, it does not have closed captioned and I was very, very disappointed.  You would think when they had it on TV it would be on the DVD series, too.  I am hard of hearing and I always get movies that has closed captioned, at least I thought I did.  I do like the Ghost Whisperer just wish it has closed captioned.",1313107200,11,395,4.038461538461538
6926408,1,B00RCPFF06,"how the hell it is possible that this great show does not have a choice of subtitles or languages? Paramount is the only study that does not add to their shows these options, I remind you gentlemen, that in the United States, the second most spoken language is Spanish, followed by French, Thai, Korean, Portuguese and so on. So, what is your excuse?. In an increasingly globalized world Paramount shows an incredible xenophobia, and definitely disturbing. I love this show, and I speak and understand English, however i will not buy it, and I recommend anyone who does not have English as their mother tongue do not buy it. Enough to discrimination against non-English speakers.",1311984000,15,679,4.913043478260869
6926409,5,B00RCPFF06,"What is there not to love?! The series was extremely entertaining, season five may not be the best but all the seasons beforehand make up for it :). Great quality.",1306713600,24,163,4.466666666666667
6926410,5,B00RCPFF06,"I enjoyed Ghost Whisperer because it shared a little girls story of how she could see ghosts of the people that died, at first she was scared of them until her Grandmother told her that she had the power to see them also.  Her Grandmother helped them to take care of their unfinished business then go into the light.

The end of the series was great because her son Aiden help bring the shadows out of her.  He helped save her because she was his hero and he didn't want anything to happen to her.  I was just sorry that was the end of the series, I would liked to have seen more of Ghost Whisperer.",1297468800,16,599,4.137931034482759

6926413,5,B00RCPFF06,"Take it from someone who watched this show and was there from the very beginning up to the very last episode, this show is PHENOMENAL. First, they could not have chosen a better cast. Jennifer Love Hewitt plays Melinda Gordon, the lead character, and yes, the ghost whisperer. She plays her part perfectly; she will have you cheering, crying, and laughing right along with her. Even when she doesn't say anything, she exudes both confidence and innocence, exactly what this show calls for. David Conrad was also an amazing cast as Melinda's husband Jim Clancy. He portrays the strong yet sensitive husband, and very believably. He has his own story to share, but is always there when Melinda needs him. Together Conrad and Hewitt make the perfect couple, the one that everyone longs to become.

Along with Conrad and Hewitt, there is also Aisha Tyler (as Andrea Marino, seasons 1-2), Jay Mohr (as Rick Payne, seasons 2-4), Camryn Manheim (as Delia Banks, seasons 2-5), Jamie Kennedy (as Eli James, seasons 4-5), Christoph Sanders (as Ned Banks, seasons 3-5) and, of course, the cute little Connor Gibbs (as Aiden Lucas, season 5). Each and every one of them brings their own story, their own drama and even their own sense of humor.

The stories and writing are original, creative, and fantastic. Even if you don't believe in ghosts, spirits, or people who can talk to them, these stories will make you believe. It will make you believe in the strength there is to be found after losing someone. Believe in the hope just one person can give an entire community. And believe that love truly never dies.
To put it short, if you want a real show, one that brings light into your life and one that will inspire you, then watch Ghost Whisperer. Follow its many ups and downs, and feel a little better off for it.
And if you don't believe me, go to Ghost Whisperer's fan pages and read what people have to say about this show. Trust me, you won't be dissappointed.
