1758524,5,B00006HAZH,"From reading not very favorible reviews here about 2000's THE RAILWAY CHILDREN I got myself this film to see for myself.  And I think it is in my opinion a very well made production.  Jemima Rooper as the oldest girl Bobbie is very good acting.  Little girl Phillis (Clare Thompson) took a bit to get used to because they are all so darn british.  Yes, sometimes they are hard to understand, especially the luggage carrier.  Nonetheless I got used to all of these characters and loved them by the end of the movie.  Maybe I learned also a little british accent on the side.  Then I read that the mother, actress Jenny Agutter, played the child Bobbie in the 1970's version of this film.  And since that film is supposed to be superior to this one I got to see that also now although its out of print and a bit expensive at the time.  But I suppose its Christmas time and I WILL get it.  It might be out of print forever.

The menu indicates that there are subtitles which I tried to get into when I did not understand every single spoken word.  But the subtitles option was closed.  Instead I learned now that I have to use the TV's remote control to access the subtitles on the DVD.

I still give it 5 stars since its one of my favorite family movies of all time now.  {The others are ANNE OF GREEN GABLES, THE ROAD TO AVONLEA, THE WALTONS, SUMMER'S END, ALAN & NAOMI, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA (the original from 1985), WHALE RIDER (australian), NESTHAEKCHEN (german), A LITTLE PRINCESS (with Amelia Shankley, british), THE MIRACLE WORKER (with Eisenberg and also the first version with Patty Duke), A PIECE OF SKY (german), TINKE - LITTLE STRONG GIRL (danish), MADITA (swedish), WHEN I WAS SEVEN (french), and THE BUTTERFLY (french}.}

Just so that you know where I am coming from.",1196553600,,1779,4.4953271028037385
1758525,4,B00006HAZH,"Years ago we use to see Masterpiece Theater movies and they were excellent dramatic movies. This is one such movie. A little more lighthearted than some, but still the somberness of well off children becoming poor, a father mysteriously is gone one night not to return, and moving to a large but dusty and possibly rat infested house, is not exactly light. Their adventures around the railroad and interesting people they meet make it a treat.

This has a good story, is very well acted, with superb sets and costumes, and decent music. Agutter and Attenborough definitely are pluses. Very interesting intro and summary of the story and even some background on the author at the end. One of the reasons I enjoyed Masterpiece Theater movies. Good quality productions and the DVD is great. I recommend it for the whole family",1181260800,3,823,4.836879432624113
1758526,5,B00006HAZH,"This movie, Railway Children, is based on the book by E. Nesbit.  It is reasonably faithful to the book.  The characters are delightful.  The scenery is gorgeous.  It is a trip back to the time when manners (and morals) were as natural as breathing.  My daughters adore it.",1180051200,,273,4.604166666666667
1758527,4,B00006HAZH,"This a very charming movie set in the turn of 20th the Century.
I have seen both versions and in my option they are both very fine movies that the whole family can watch.
I have to agree with one of the reviews, the brief commentary at the beginning and the end of the movie
is in my view detrimental to the production. I really don't understand why the writers did that.
Other then then the commentary the movie is very fine.
The acting is wonderful, the settings and costumes are beautiful.
This movie is worth while adding to your DVD library.
Especially if you are looking for family movies.",1173052800,3,595,4.418181818181818
1758528,3,B00006HAZH,"This PBS version of ""The Railway Children"" is nowhere near as

charming as the original 1970 movie.  If you saw this TV version and liked it, you owe it to yourself to see the young Jenny Agutter in the earlier film.  In my opinion, the PBS remake lacks the warmth and civility of the original.",1103414400,71,294,4.3090909090909095
1758529,4,B00006HAZH,"This is a splendid remake of E. Nesbit's classic children's novel, The Railway Children -- it is as good as the earlier (1970) version, and also, in its way, as delightful and moving as the book itself. Jenny Agutter, who was wonderful as Bobbie in the earlier version, is equally splendid as mother in this; while Jemima Rooper makes a perfect Bobbie, struggling on the threshhold of womanhood. The production is in general careful and imaginative. I have one criticism only -- why, oh why, do those responsible for Masterpiece Theater imagine that we are incapable of appreciating such an offering as this without ""commentary"" before and after it? There would be something patronizing about such an assumption, even if the commentary said anything worth saying: as it is, we are inflicted with several minutes of Russell Baker mouthing pompous, irrelevant twaddle. Five stars for the movie, and MINUS five for whomever cooked up that nonsense!",1043971200,34,945,5.064102564102564
1758530,5,B00006HAZH,"E. Nesbit's stories have charmed children and adults for a century.  Many of her books are about children who gain magical powers or contact magical creatures.  They are fun, but none has as much strength and beauty as The Railway Children.  This is a story of three children whose father is falsely imprisoned.  They and their mother retreat into the countryside where they live  a hand to mouth existence for several months.  Nesbit included quite a few of her own democratic socialist beliefs into The Railway Children, but the ideology does not detract from the story.
This DVD is beautifully done so that the outdoor scenes, especially, are magnificent.  The children's adventures and their developing friendships with the people who live in and around their small village are all lovingly filmed.  A host of talented actors, including Michael Kitchen, Jenny Agutter, and Sophie Thompson, among many others, enhance the story. And the final scenes, when the newly released father steps off the train into his daughter's arms, are guaranteed to produce a lump in your throat.",1043884800,18,1079,5.090909090909091

Of course, the railroad magnates were not as warm and friendly, most of the time, as Richard Attenborough's character, but it does show the ""romance"" of the railroad and the fascination with trains that still exists today.  I quite enjoyed this film, and have watched it several times.  I'm happy to own it now, so I can watch it again as often as I wish.",1491091200,5,383,4.442857142857143

I have viewed this twice and thought it would be a good gift to my daughter and her husband who have three beautiful girls. The movie is squeaky clean, rare in this day and age. Great movie to watch as a family, a treat to watch without the sex and violence so predominant in present day productions. Miss Agutter acted her role beautifully. My only regret, if I can force myself to name one, is the short appearance of Sir Michael at the beginning and end of the movie. Of course, short as it is, he was superb in portraying his role, a wonderful book end to a heartwarming story. (I like him very much as Mr. Foyle).",1474329600,9,675,4.365079365079365

1758612,4,B00006HAZH,"This is a clean, family movie that leaves you feeling good. It's the turn of the 20th century. The lives of a ""posh"" English family is turned upside down when the father suddenly disappears. Everything is sold and the mother and children move to the country to live in drastically reduced circumstances. Although they struggle, that is not really what you see. You see how they survive, deal with the poverty, reach out and make friends, and have fun by the railroad.

The ending is not a real surprise, but getting there is a warm ride. The acting is well done. The sets are perfect. The story is heartwarming, but not unforgettable. It's appropriate for all ages. No bad language or sex or anything like that.",1443916800,3,711,4.642857142857143

1758631,5,B00006HAZH,"This is a very nicely done film based on a novel.  It highlights the struggles of a family when their father is imprisoned and they are forced to live beneath their means in a small Yorkshire village.  Their main source of entertainment involves following the happenings of the local train station and railroad.  They befriend the baggage carrier and as it turns out, one of the executives of the railway.  The prologue and the postludes were both very interesting and informative.  My Mother thought it was interesting to see how the children had to devise their own methods of entertainment, pre-internet game days.  And just overall, it is a very nice film with some class distinctions and social commentary being included in the plot line.  We enjoyed it very much.",1427068800,,769,4.869230769230769

This is utterly delightful, and I found it a worthy successor to the 1960s series. The acting is excellent, especially that of the children, who very much carry the story. Jenny Agutter is just right as the mother trying desperately hard to cope when the bottom has fallen out of her world. In the smaller roles many fine character actors, including Richard Attenborough and Michael Kitchen, add to the richness of this film.

Heartwarming, with an ending that made me sob, even though I knew it was coming. A pure pleasure to watch.",1290297600,,669,4.808695652173913

1758769,5,B00006HAZH,"I have not seen the 1970 version but found this version to be a charming and satisfying evening's entertainment. We rented the movie first to check it out and were both so pleased with it that we decided to buy our own copy.

The scenery, most specifically the beautiful English countryside, acting, and ambience are all compelling and suitable for the entire family. We look forward to repeated viewings of this movie.

It has the usual cast of English actors and actresses with many familiar faces all doing their usual competent jobs; I must confess that I was surprised that Michael Kitchen had such a small part, he's such a fine actor I would have enjoyed seeing more of his work.

I recommend it highly!",1282089600,18,710,4.664

1758771,5,B00006HAZH,"So much of children's entertainment these days is pure twaddle.  This classic movie is an exception.  It teaches the value of family and being content when one's material circumstances are reduced and family is all one has left. It also teaches how important it is to give to others, even when one may be hurting herself.  My 4-year-old train enthusiast loves this film as do his parents and grandparents.",1248134400,5,405,4.840579710144928
1758772,3,B00006HAZH,"A good family movie. I found this reminiscent of Anne of Green Gables or the  Avonlea TV series. Except this is set in England, not Canada. But along the same time period. (late Victorian or Edwardian)  This movie is also more about the children in a family, than the adults, as the  Avonlea series was.

These children faced hardship, but they did not allow this to break their spirits. They kept hope, and despite their own troubles they had concern for their  fellow man.

Jemina Rooper played the oldest daughter, a young teenager. Jenny Agutter was the mother. We also saw David Bamber and Sophie Thompson in supporting roles. Several of my favorite BBC actors!

I enjoyed this enough that I would now like the see the older mini series based on the same story.",1247184000,7,766,4.62962962962963

1758775,5,B00006HAZH,"This is Masterpiece Theatre on DVD. Based on the book of the same title by Edith Nesbit, it is set at the turn of the 20th century. The patriarch of a well-to-do family is taken in the middle of the night. The family is forced to move to the country and the mother sets to provide for them while the children spend their time exploring the area. Most of their adventures surround the Railway Station; the tracks, trains, employees, and travelers. Their sincere desire to help those around them is soon repaid when the friendship they form with one rider in particular holds the key to where their father has gone. The acting is wonderful and the film was enjoyed by our entire family!

*A note to parents: While the entire movie is appropriate for children of all ages, it is important to note that in Masterpiece Theatre fashion, after the film the narrator gives a glimpse into the life of the author. The details shared here may not be something you are ready to discuss with your children (or would at least like a little warning on).",1242777600,33,1038,4.5212765957446805

1758777,5,B00006HAZH,"This movie by the BCC is based on the book The Railway Children by E. Nesbit.  It hardly omits anything.  The actors depict the simplicity and good-heartedness of the children, and none of the side-plots are skipped.  For example, the children bring the broken-down Russian into their house without thinking twice.  Even though they realize that they are poor, they see his distress and want to help him, even if it means a little sacrifice on their part.  And when the teenager student, Jim, breaks his leg they bring him to their house and adopt him as a brother.

As far as I can see, the single flaw in the in the video is when the dad comes home.  The reunion seems more sad than glad.  The dad acts tired and even his smile seems uncertain.  His family all hesitate to come to him, and though their actions are joyous, they all seem close to tears.  Family reunions just aren't that way.

All in all, this is an extremely good movie.  It just has a couple of minor flaws.  It is taken from the book afore mentioned, and isn't slap-dash or wild.  The video is very well done.

It was wonderful to see siblings getting along and working together with a just a slight disagreement now and then. They truly made friends with all ages and backgrounds as they ran about the countryside and small town. Highly recommended.,1524441600,,329,4.7894736842105265

7968820,5,B00006HAZH,"... a family is reduced in income and stature. They move to the country near a rail line. There the children learn more of life and people then they would have in their previous pampered environment. Many of their neighbors also learn a few things about sacrifice and friendship. Meantime the children, while worried as to the disappearance of their father, they begin waving to passing trains and this leads to many adventures.

Jenny Agutter played Bobbie Waterbury in the 1970 version. In this version she plays ""mother"".

Even though the story is transparent, the execution is excellent. The acting is superb and the costumes, even the train fit period of the story. I may have been stretch to believe in a philanthropic railroad tycoon.",1507334400,,741,4.92
