8103426,4,B000E0OBL0,"Lucienne Garnier a typist for the newspaper is engaged to Andr one of the linotype operators at the same paper. I we get use of them being happy at the sea and at meals and so forth. One day Lucienne gets this urge to enter her picture in a beauty contest. Little did she know at the time that jealous Andr is revolted at the idea? Whoops too late now she is Ms. France. On the very day that Andre intends to propose she is wished off to Spain to become Miss Europe. You will have to watch the film to see how this plays out.

The story is not a new one it actually was produced earlier at least once in 1922 and several times after the film. I've only seen the DVD version so I cannot comment on what might or might not have been cut out or what might or might not have been dubbed other than in this presentation.

Maybe it's sacrilege to Louise Brooks aficionados yet I had just as much fun looking at all of the technology of the time in this film. I was an especially intrigued with the close-ups of the Linotype machine as I had set type by hand before and never had a chance to use one. Then there was the still camera with 6 second exposure. I had seen Bakelite phones but I never saw one of those hanging phones that they were using at this time. We get close-ups of unique train cabin amenities.

This presentation makes a good addition to your Louise Brooks collection.",1481328000,,1380,4.1610486891385765
8103427,5,B000E0OBL0,A nice wonderful curiosity of a film in Louise  Brooks career. While not as captivating as Pandora's Box or Diary of a Lost Girl . It is nonetheless a pleasant film. And should be judged on it's own merits. And has a very poetic ironic  ending that must be seen .,1402963200,2,263,4.137254901960785
8103428,3,B000E0OBL0,"This French film was American starlet Louis Brooks first talkie.  Ironically since it was in French, Ms. Brooks' voice was dubbed throughout.  Frankly it is a bit of a disappointment, especially after the 2 great films (""Pandora's Box"" and ""Diary of a Lost Girl"") that she made with German director G. W. Pabst just prior.

Part of the problem could be with the Kino DVD that I watched.  It had numerous scenes that were hard to watch due to video noise and disjointed sound.  It all sounded terribly artificial even for 1930.  Directed by Augusto Genina, Ms. Brooks plays Lucienne (Lucy), a pool typist at a local newspaper.  She is romantically linked to Andre (Georges Charlia), one of the paper's typesetters.  As a lark, Lucy sends in her photo to be considered for a first of its kind beauty pageant to be held in Spain.  The winner would be crowned Miss Europe.  To her surprise, Lucy is selected as a finalist and is provided transportation and lodging for the pageant.

Andre isn't very happy about all of this.  He doesn't like other men ogling his girlfriend.  He, like most men of his time, wants her to be more domestic, making dinner, cleaning and such.  Or just out with him having fun.  One of the film's undercurrents is that Lucy is not too keen on the blue collar ruffians Andre hangs out with, nor with some of the places that they go to for fun.  It's Andre's idea of fun, not hers.

Ultimately she decides to go, and to no one's surprise she wins.  This brings her many admirers including a nobleman who also has connections in the film industry.  Lucy sees this as an opportunity to escape her hard work environment, but she still loves Andre and he wants no part of it, giving her an ultimatum.  She stays with him briefly but when she is offered a movie career, she can't turn it down.

In one of the film's dramatic high points, it concludes in grand style as Andre goes off kilter and tracks down his, now former, girlfriend.  While this final act is well written and presented, it doesn't completely save the film.  While Brooks' performance is admirable, especially given the language barrier, the rest of the actors don't offer much support.  While this is not Louise Brooks' best film, it is worth a look for her admirers.",1392422400,,2253,4.575
8103429,5,B000E0OBL0,"I have long made it a tradition to lower my quality expectations when purchasing obscure foreign films featuring stars i like, and by the time this film arrived i'll admit i was regretting my having purchased it in the first place, but then i put it in.
It was a thousand times better than i ever thought it would be, the film was in such good condition and the print was really well maintained. the french wasn't nearly as bad as i'd heard it was and the brilliant lighting and direction made up for the voiceovers completely, not to mention Brooksie's performance, she's adorable! and this is better quality film of her than i found in the kino diary of a lost girl dvd, i am so happy with how they handled this obscure and overly criticized film.",1390780800,2,749,4.434782608695652

8103431,3,B000E0OBL0,"I have heard the singing voice used by Louise Brooks in Prix de Beaute. Not only is it not Edith Piaf,singing in the film dubbed for Louise Brooks. Edith Piaf was not singing professionally in 1930,nor was she recording in 1930. Since when is Louise Brooks a soprano?",1251590400,6,267,4.583333333333333
8103432,4,B000E0OBL0,"A lot of people including my self by-pass silent films because of no sound. But if you want to see some really good early films you cannot go wrong with this film. A little on the long side it's star American Louise Brooks, as she did in Diary of a Lost Girl and Pandora's Box, is great and these movies show how great movies and acting these early works are.  It's odd that German Cinema took a movie actress (Louise Brooks)from Hollywood and turned her into a star and Hollywood took this star and turned her into  B film actress because of personal prejudice a great lost.",1192752000,5,575,4.364485981308412
8103433,4,B000E0OBL0,"I do own a VHS edition of this movie ( 1989 Interama Video Classics) which also seems sped up,

as mentioned by a previous reviewer, but is listed as 93 min. on the case and listed as 94:38 on the tape itself (lead-in/out?).

IMDB also lists this as a 93 min. movie. This release is 88 min.

So is this missing 5 minutes or being run at a faster fps? I'm also hearing rumours of a 108 or 109 min. restored silent version.

I'm thrilled to see more Louise Brooks on DVD, but wondering if this is a release worthy of the Screen Goddess.",1142121600,12,534,4.105769230769231
8103434,3,B000E0OBL0,"I'm going to comment more on the technical side of the disc, because the speed issue made it a bit tough to enjoy or properly judge the film.

Unfortunately, the film just runs too fast. I've never seen that before with a sound film; it normally effects silents due to the lack of a standard speed in the silent film era. My understanding is that this was originally shot as a silent, with dialogue & lots of sound effects added just before release.  As this is the only print of the film I've seen, I am uncertain whether the frame rate was sped up in 1930 when they dubbed the dialogue, when they did this digital transfer, or at some point in between. The voices don't sound like chipmunks to me, but I am totally unfamiliar with French. The print is quite clear for the age, although there are a number of dropouts where a second or 2 is missing. My guess is that it's a largely unrestored 35 mm print in fairly good shape.

The silent version was also said to have been released in 1930 concurrent with this dubbed version. Brooks did not do any of her own dialogue, the speaking parts were dubbed by a French actress & the singing by Edith Piaf. IF there is an existing print of the silent version, I would be very interested to see it; I suspect it would be superior.

Just a couple comments on the film: The last 20 minutes or so is definitely the best part. I also was really surprised that they showed Brooks & her UNMARRIED boyfriend in bed together. The scene was totally non physical & they were both wearing heavy bed clothes; but this would have never happened in a pre 1960's US film, even pre codes only hinted at such things. Brooks is good, but it's definitely not her best performance. She appears somewhat bored until the last 20 minutes or so. Again, the film might have been more enjoyable if the motion wasn't so speeded up.

I'm a bit surprised that Kino would release something with this large of a flaw & no explanation as to why. I consider Kino to be #1 in quality of all US companies that specialize in silent film.",1141776000,28,2045,4.342931937172775
