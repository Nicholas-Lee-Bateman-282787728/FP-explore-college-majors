8175562,3,B00001MXY1,"This movie is a mixed bag.  It has some genuinely creepy moments, and a cool gothic atmosphere.  The basic story is actually pretty good.  Kind of a cross between a vampire flick and a mad scientist movie.  The early  moments of the film have the feel of a classic Universal horror movie from  the 30's or 40's, but you don't have to wait long for the low-budget  schlockiness (is that a word?) to kick in. This isn't really a bad thing if  you're into this kind of movie like I am.  The bad acting, inane dialogue  and hokey narration don't quite reach the levels of an Ed Wood or Al  Adamson classic, but it's entertaining nonetheless.  The only complaint  that I have is that there are a couple of places in the film where the  dialogue between characters becomes painfully long-winded to the point  where it isn't even amusing anymore.  All things said though, I would  definitely recommend this to any B movie junkie.",956188800,4,922,4.524390243902439
