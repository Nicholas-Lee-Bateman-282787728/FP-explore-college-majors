The chemistry between kajol & Srk was electrifying.all the actors who had a big or small role has done marvellous job. Must watch.

4132331,4,B003K02EV0,"Humungous expectations have preceded this movie and stars one of the biggest stars of the Indian Film Industry Shahrukh Khan who has thus far given two flops i.e. Billu Barber and Dulha Mil Gaya, although they were not considered to be noteworthy to begin with.
Karan Johar who began his career with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai has started to venture in to serious cinema territory with Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna has also tried to maintain this stance with his production house producing diverse fares such as Dostana and Wake up Sid.
Even before the release this movie was in the hot water with the Shiv Sena, a right wing party prevented its release because of statements made by Shahrukh about some Pakistani cricket players.
The foray of Fox Search Light pictures in Bollywood with the payment of an obscene amount of rupees for the rights, they hope to have a successful launch where Sony stumbled with Saawariya.
How does this all bode with MNIK?
MNIK is the story of Rizvaan Khan who suffers from Aspergers and has the inability to deal with social situations and interactions. He migrates to America after his brother sponsors him and starts working as a cosmetics salesman. He meets Kajol, a single mother who works in a salon and falls in love. His brother protests his decision to marry her but they do and start a small business together. Their domestic bliss is interrupted until 9/11. Life takes a tragic turn and Mandira accuses Rizvan and his faith for the tragedy. They separate and Rizvaan embarks on a journey that will bring back Mandira and clear conceptions about his name and religion.
The movie showcases the finest talents India has to offer and Shahrukh delivers his best performance to date in recent years after Chak De. Any doubts that one had about his acting ability are permanently erased.  Acting as a person with Autism, he is simply superb and has all the gestures and mannerisms to a T, I know this because I work with Autistic children. His acting makes you smile, watch the scene when Kajol asks him to marry him or the scene when he is interrogated at the airport. In fact in every scene there is a nuance that deserves a second viewing. Hopefully we will be able to see more of Rizvaan and less of Raj in the future. I cannot wait for the DVD to see the brilliant scenes individually.
Kajol is simply superb, and makes a grand re entry. She plays the role of the supporting wife, and devasted mother with deftness. The chemistry of Shahrukh and Kajol is simply electric.
Karan Johar's direction and Shibhani Bhatija's script is marvelous. Ravi Chandrans cinematography captures the American landscape remarkably well. Shankar - Ehsaan and Loy have complemented the movie with great music. My personal favorites are Sajdaa and Noor E Khuda.  The only drawback that I can find would be Deepa Bhatia's editing, the second half could have been a little shorter and less preachy because it attempts to make Rizvaan in to a some sort of an icon.
On the whole, My name is Khan is a great movie. I give it four stars because in my opinion the first half deserves 5 stars while the second half deserves 3 because things get a bit lengthy. Watch this movie now. Four stars 12/18/10
Post Script: If you have seen the movie and found it too long, the American version is being readied for release and it is supposedly about 35 minutes shorter. Dharma Productions have recruited the services of Alan Edward Bell, director of 500 Days of Summer and will be released on the 7th of May with subtitles and voiceovers in English.",1266537600,64,3538,4.668269230769231

4132334,5,B003K02EV0,"To be honest, movies rarely make me cry, but when watching this movie, I've been crying ever since Sam was kicked to death by those bullies who racial profiled him. This really is the best movie I've ever watched. Rizvan Khan has autism spectrum disorder (ASD, DSM V no longer has Asperger's syndrome so I'm using the term ASD instead), and as a result, while he has feelings, he can't express them properly. He also has many other quirks, such as fear of new places, noise, and the color yellow. Since 9/11, Muslim Americans have been categorically dehumanized, even though most of them are really just ordinary citizens who have done nothing wrong. Rizvan Khan used his action, and the action of his Muslim followers, to demonstrate that America's ""enemy"" are really no enemy at all. He can't express his love in ordinary ways, but no word speaks louder than action. Since he was a child, his mom had taught him that there are only two kinds of people in the world: good people who do good deeds, and bad people who do bad deeds; we can't tell which is Muslim and which is Hindu. This has inspired him throughout his life. This movie shows the low between Khan, a Muslim, and his Hindu wife. It also showed the love between the Christian community of Mama Jenny and a Muslim community of Khan. However, there're also bad people from different faiths in this movie: Hindus who hated innocent Muslims, Christians not welcoming people of other faiths to their charity event, and Muslims who hated innocent people who identify with groups whose few members have killed innocent Muslims. Indeed, hate breed more hate, but love can overcome hate. Also, as Khan believes, the way of God is the way of compassion. We should live God's way, regardless of our labels. Isn't God so much greater than our cheap manmade labels? Hallelujah, praise the Lord! We really should see people as who they are, rather than caricatures based on labels. I highly recommend this movie to everyone in the Trump age.",1518825600,,1991,4.707736389684814

4132347,2,B003K02EV0,"The product is fine. I had no problems with the subtitles, the audio, the video, or anything like that.

I just didn't like the movie.  It felt too much like propaganda.  It didn't feel believable.  It never sold me on the basic premise of the movie that the main character Rizwan Khan feels the need to travel around the country for years trying to talk to the President of the USA.  The movie was trying to do too much, and despite the length of the movie (the length of the movie didn't bother me, but it is a long movie), it didn't have enough time to adequately flesh out some of the things it was trying to demonstrate.  Too much of the time was spent about Rizwan's disability, and it was not adequately merged with the message it was trying to give about religious intolerance.

The way that so many characters were introduced felt very clumsy.  Rizwan's teacher in India, Rizwan's wife, the reporters that covered his case, the radical Islamic preacher he encounters, the small town in Georgia that he visits, etc. were all thrown in very clumsily.

The acting was quite good.  The cinematography and music were unremarkable (i.e. they didn't stand out as great, or stand out as horrible).  But the plot and script were inadequate, and they detracted from the movie, and the excellent acting wasn't able to cover for the poor writing of the movie.

But as a disclaimer, I like foreign films, especially the more artistic and philosophical movies.  I'm not as interested in the simplistic commercial movies.  I don't tend to like Bollywood or Hollywood movies for this reason.  I bought this movie because it was only $5 and the concept of exploring religious intolerance indicated the possibility for a movie that would be philosophical enough for my tastes, but in the end, it was too much of the commercialized type of movies we get from Bollywood and Hollywood that are produced for the masses, and not enough of an intellectual art film for my tastes.

If you're not into art films and prefer films produced for the masses, you'll like this film more than I did, and that's totally okay.",1501286400,,2100,4.665760869565218

4132358,3,B003K02EV0,"I watch a lot of Bollywood movies and SRK has to be my favorite male lead, so I am no stranger to this genre. The only reason why it gets three stars is because of SRK's ability to convince the audience that he is an adult with ASD.  The first half of the movie showed such promise, but the second half really jumps the shark.  You'd think after years of having been stereotyped as accent-laden, awkward techies or exotic beauties without a brain, Indians would tend to avoid making the same mistakes with other cultures in a film.  The African-American stereotypes are so heavy-handed, it's hard to ignore. Ditto for the over-the-top ""here come the Muslims to the rescue"" (conveniently) in the middle of an active hurricane.  The overreaching topic of the movie deserves to be discussed but not at the expense of a believable plot and sharp dialogue.  Not SRK's brightest performance certainly, and very sloppy screenwriting.",1492041600,,926,4.8354430379746836

This film made me think hard about my personal prejudices in areas where I thought I had none.  It is about love, hope, and how important it is for us to see people based on actions not on their religion, race, economic status, and so much more.  Phenomenal story line.  Excellent Direction and acting.  Shahrukh Khan's performance is stunning.  A must see film.  In Hindi with English subtitles...at times it was difficult to keep up with the subtitles in order to capture the essence of the facial expressions and experiences of the actors. I loved this film.

And while it's integral to the message of the movie -- that people should be judged on the basis of how they behave rather than who or what they are -- the dead kid plot makes America look bad because stuff like that didn't happen here post 9/11, no matter how much the writers of this film wish it had. It has happened in India but not in America. There are lots of other reasons American viewers won't like this movie -- it's unbelievable from the moment the drop-dead gorgeous female lead falls for the handicapped male lead -- but that one is the most important.

4132512,5,B003K02EV0,"Due to circumstances in America this movie did not get the recognition it deserved.

The acting was so good, Shah Rukh Khan should have won a Oscar just like Dustin Hoffman did years earlier but Rain Man was not a Muslim and we were not living in a time when we were so mistrustful of anything wearing a scarf.

SRK plays a Indian Muslim man named Rizvan Khan with Asperger's syndrome, who falls in love with a Hindu Indian woman (Kajol) who has a son from her first marriage. They get married and then 9/11 takes place. Their son is beaten to death in racist hate and Mandira  in her pain blames Razvan for her sons death. She kicks him out and tells him she will take him back if he tells the president of the United States his name is Khan and his is not a terrorist. He embarks on a cross-country journey to talk to the president and win Mandira back.

I generally watch Indian movies for the romance not for a lesson in racism and culture divides but this one is so honest and heart warming/breaking that I hope people give it a try. The plot is well thought out and the chemistry between Khan and Kajol is great.

This movie is one of my favorite all time movies.",1444348800,,1169,4.247747747747748

Kajol is my favorite SRK was to until recently I find myself really enjoying Amir Khan. Nevertheless SRK will always have my heart and he did a fantastic job as usual in this movie. There is a saying about if you don't play a person with a disability right it could tarnish your acting credentials, but SRK surpassed doing it right. He was extremely believable and very realistic. And Kajol...ahhhh she gets more beautiful with age and her acting is always top notch in my opinion. She embodies her character in this one and I can feel it coming off the screen. This movie was perfect. They handled the 9/11 storyline wonderfully. After watching it It actually made me sit and think about how drastically the world did change after that event not just for Americans but for Arabians, Pakistanis, Indians..pretty much everyone whose origin is in the Middle East. This movie made me step outside of being a Black person being born and raised in America but I got to see what its like for people with Middle Eastern ancestry who live right here in America what they go through on a day to day basis.",1427587200,4,1194,4.558139534883721

I feel that racism is a gangrene that can eat at humans soul just as physical gangrene eventually eats away the flesh.  Khan in his innocence was so simplistic, yet what he said was forceful.  ""My name is Khan and I am not a terrorist.  It is imperative that we not judge a whole nation by one person.  Example:  My mom was abused by a lady (she was a home attendant) that was from a South American city.  After I got rid of the abusive home attendant, the next one was from the same country as the abusive helper.  She took care of my mom until she died and treated her very well and loved her.  Which shows, that we should not just people as the same.  There is good and bad in all nationalities.  Anyhow, that is my take on the movie.

I cried probably three times during it and loved the way it honestly and sympathetically portrayed people of many different faiths and walks of life post 9/11. There was good and bad in people of the various categories, but it tended to move the viewer away from constructs like category to look instead at the character and actions of the individuals. I also liked that it showed the intimacy and playfulness of a married couple in love without showing a single graphic or inappropriately suggestive scene. Although the film portrays violence by and toward kids and so would be upsetting for younger children, I'd recommend it for viewing as a family for those ages 12 and up. There's definitely a lot of fodder for good discussion of important topics, beginning with the lessons Rizvan's mother teaches.",1402012800,5,902,4.863636363636363

I was very interested in watching this movie when I saw what it was about, though I honestly expected it to be a little one-sided.

I have seen many Hindi films starring Shah Rukh Kahn and some have been very good, but, his performance in this film was outstanding.  His interpretation of an autistic person was sensitive and insightful, showing true empathy and understanding for an autistc person's particular view of life and his environment.  Kajol, as always, rendered a fine performance and gave a very realistic and heartfelt interpretation of a grieving mother.  The film, I am sad to say, presented a very realistic  view of American's regretable tendency towards bigotry, racism and hatred of those fellow humans who are 'different', i.e., not WASP.  I am an American and proud of it. I only hope that in the future, with an expanded knowledge of the world and greater intelligence, we may see the great variety of creatures, especially the human varity, for what they ALL are, a miraculous gift of the creator.

4132680,5,B003K02EV0,"You often think of Bollywood as actors dancing around mountains.  This movie defied that stereotype by presenting a serious and relevant theme.  You often think of Bollywood as very India-centric and dealing with themes only relevant to the Indian experience.  But this movie combined the experience of the NRI, Muslim American, African American and Caucasian American and melded these experiences together.

I was impressed with the acting of Shah Rukh Khan and his ability to take on the role of someone with Aspergers syndrome.  I don't watch too many Bollywood movies, but in all of the movies, SRK seems to have the upper hand (in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, he was the ""cooler"" one;  In Kabhi Kushi Kabhi Gham he was the richer one.  So it was interesting, for once, he took the back seat, and was the one who was the more awkward one.  I now have a new respect for him.

It is obvious that Karan Johar did his research and incorporated American themes such as the song ""We Shall Overcome,"" the black church, bullying, into the theme.

However, as an American, I did see some minor inaccuracies:  when Khan said he needed to see Bush because the election was in three days.  (Actually, Bush would continue to be President for another two and a half months).  Also, if a young boy has been born and brought up in the States, he would likely speak in an American accent - but Mandira's son did not.  This is insignificant to the movie, but it's something I noticed.",1388793600,,1461,4.612403100775194

I strongly recommend that you check it out, as it is a great international piece, for any non Indian Bollywood fans.

"" High functioning Asberger Syndrome"" is how he introduces himself to a group of strangers.

The portrayal of Khan's Autism is both accurate and endearing.  It is an amazing story that looks into ignorance and intolerance versus forgiveness, selflessness and kindness.  Part of the story portrays how innocent Muslims were affected by 911- fear, anger, prejudice, but also meekness and forgiveness.
There are some political views lightly expressed (the producers favored Obama over Bush), but it really doesn't detract from the overarching theme of compassion and seeking to understand, and doing what you know is right regardless of what anyone else thinks or does.

I have a complaint with Amazon's movie rental policy of of needing to watch the whole movie within a 24 period of starting it, or being forced to re-pay the full rental fee for another night. This movie is almost 3 hours long, and we just couldn't finish the whole thing on the first night, had to crash & go to bed. I found it appalling that we had to pay the full $4.99 the next night because it had been about 25 hours since we started it.

I imagine the movie only barely scratches the surface of how Muslim/Sikh/Hindu Americans were treated after 9/11, or how the event affected their lives. It also shows the many struggles adults with Asperger's Syndrome might face. The movie is able to draw the viewer into the lives of the struggling characters very well.

One large drawback of the film is the various scenes, perhaps intending to indicate New Orleans in the Katrina hurricane disaster, depicting an African-American community in the South. The depiction is ridiculously inaccurate verging on offensive, but the intention of the Director is well understood if you can get past the stereotypes.

For those who have their own views in life but accept humbly and openly the views of others, for those who say good morning to a stranger on the street when passing by (that eliminates 90% !)....

For those who view another persons color... including white as just another color... as curious and interesting rather than harmful or wrong, for those who hear another person speak in their native language and don't think they are smarter or better.

And lastly, for those who don't go around thinking they are better or smarter or more powerful because they live in a certain nation.......

Then this will be perhaps the best movie you ever saw.....

Karan Johar who began his career with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai has started to venture in to serious cinema territory with Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna has also tried to maintain this stance with his production house producing diverse fares such as Dostana and Wake up Sid.
Even before the release this movie was in the hot water with the Shiv Sena, a right wing party prevented its release because of statements made by Shahrukh about some Pakistani cricket players.
The foray of Fox Search Light pictures in Bollywood with the payment of an obscene amount of rupees for the rights, they hope to have a successful launch where Sony stumbled with Saawariya.
How does this all bode with MNIK?
MNIK is the story of Rizvaan Khan who suffers from Aspergers and has the inability to deal with social situations and interactions. He migrates to America after his brother sponsors him and starts working as a cosmetics salesman. He meets Kajol, a single mother who works in a salon and falls in love. His brother protests his decision to marry her but they do and start a small business together. Their domestic bliss is interrupted until 9/11. Life takes a tragic turn and Mandira accuses Rizvan and his faith for the tragedy. They separate and Rizvaan embarks on a journey that will bring back Mandira and clear conceptions about his name and religion.
The movie showcases the finest talents India has to offer and Shahrukh delivers his best performance to date in recent years after Chak De. Any doubts that one had about his acting ability are permanently erased. Acting as a person with Autism, he is simply superb and has all the gestures and mannerisms to a T, I know this because I work with Autistic children. His acting makes you smile, watch the scene when Kajol asks him to marry him or the scene when he is interrogated at the airport. In fact in every scene there is a nuance that deserves a second viewing. Hopefully we will be able to see more of Rizvaan and less of Raj in the future. I cannot wait for the DVD to see the brilliant scenes individually.
Kajol is simply superb, and makes a grand re entry. She plays the role of the supporting wife, and devasted mother with deftness. The chemistry of Shahrukh and Kajol is simply electric.
Karan Johar's direction and Shibhani Bhatija's script is marvelous. Ravi Chandrans cinematography captures the American landscape remarkably well. Shankar - Ehsaan and Loy have complemented the movie with great music. My personal favorites are Sajdaa and Noor E Khuda. The only drawback that I can find would be Deepa Bhatia's editing, the second half could have been a little shorter and less preachy because it attempts to make Rizvaan in to a some sort of an icon.
On the whole, My name is Khan is a great movie. I give it four stars because in my opinion the first half deserves 5 stars while the second half deserves 3 because things get a bit lengthy. Watch this movie now. Four stars 12/18/10
Post Script: If you have seen the movie and found it too long, the American version is being readied for release and it is supposedly about 35 minutes shorter.

My name isn't 1 that would trigger everyone to go ""oh, no Muslim!""....it's how I dress modestly that bothers them. Don't Christians portray Mary the Mother of Jesus who we also honor in Islam as having her hair covered? And in case anyone failed to notice, every other major act of violence here in the US for many many years was not related to Muslims or Islam in any way! It is always people who have their minds messed up who commit these horrible acts not people who truly honor their faith. My faith IS one of peace and one were I am to submit to Allah (who is called Allah by Christians in Arabic countries also by the way).

4132775,2,B003K02EV0,"I'm giving this movie two stars for being somewhat entertaining, but also a profoundly annoying and foolish piece of propaganda.

The movie starts out as a cute love story set in San Francisco, bringing together an Autistic Moslem man and a free-spirited, modern Hindu woman.  These religious affiliations are important, because the movie soon takes on a very specific political agenda, one that seeks to paint Islam only in the most favorable light.  After a tragedy - or more accurately, after a barely plausible racist attack by affluent white youths in a thinly-disguised Bay Area suburb - our hero goes on a quest to proclaim to the President of the United States (no less!) his innocence of terrorist intent.  At this point the film becomes increasingly silly, and loses any credibility either as a historical drama or as a piece of art.  We note in particular the absurdity of the hero's and his companions' interventions in the aftermath of a hurricane in rural Georgia, the storm still going on in full force days after the initial event and in the absence of all the usual emergency responders - the Red Cross, local hospitals, Federal agencies, and so on.  The not-so-subtle subtext is that only the big-hearted Moslems care about rural African Americans.

The most dishonest aspect of the film, however, is in its deliberate misquotation from the Quran in support of the proposition that Islam inherently deplores the murder of innocents.  The critical verse, which is actually cited in the movie, is the 32nd verse of the 5th Sura.  The deliberate omission from this verse is the proviso that allows, and indeed advocates, the murder of all those who are engaged in ""spreading corruption"".  This verse, and other similar verses elsewhere, is interpreted by radical Moslems to encompass anyone who is not of the Islamic faith, and to justify Jihad.  Omitting the language suggests that a moderate interpretation of the Prophet's words is the only possible interpretation.  If only that were true!",1354924800,4,2008,5.015060240963855

Seeing how this young muslim with a mental disability was able to become a hero was really great. I watched it with my wife and kids and we all enjoyed a great moment. What I liked was how they split the story in three parts: 1) the first hour is kinda like your typical bollywood feel-good movie, showing the birth of a love relationship; 2) the second part is a sad and almost depressing drama; 3) the third part is a heroic tale of adventure.

Unlike pure bollywood productions, there are no group dances here. It feels more like an american movie, although there are beautiful songs throughout.

The political message is strong, and this may be one of the few movies which dared to adress explicitly the pakistani - hindi opposition, as well as the american post 9/11 trauma.

4132792,5,B003K02EV0,"This movie has two parts to it, the love story between Rizwan Khan (Shahrukh Khan) and Miranda (Kajol), and Rizwan's quest to speak to the president and declare, ""My name is Khan, and I'm not a terrorist."" The Rizwan-Miranda love story is portrayed as Rizwan's flashback while traveling to Washington D.C. to meet the president. I believe this technique was quite effective and did not disrupt the flow of the story. Both parts are just as good and gives variety to the film.

Rizwan grew up as a Muslim in India and was later diagnosed with the mental illness called the Asperger's syndrome. After being sponsored by his brother in America to move to the states, he meets Miranda, a Hindu who falls in love and marries Rizwan. Just when everything seems perfect, the 9/11 attacks took place and the post-9/11 prejudice tears the couple apart. Miranda sarcastically tells Rizwan to tell the president that he is not a terrorist before he is allowed to see her again. Rizwan takes it seriously and begins his quest.

In addition to the great plot, the movie incorporated good humor and religious significance. One thing I love about this film is that it attacks many stereotypes against Muslims and shows that Islam is not about violence. In one of the scenes, Rizwan confronts some Muslim extremists and explains the true meaning of Islam and the brotherhood that they share. It also reminds you of the hardship that innocent Muslims have to bear after the terrorist attacks. The perfect love story destroyed by a few extremists makes you watch with compassion.

I seldom watch Bollywood movies, but the high movie ratings made me give it a try. And surely, the ratings didn't lie and it is a must-see Bollywood film, especially for those who need a new perspective of Islam.",1338595200,2,1775,4.794117647058823

4132795,4,B003K02EV0,"Enough of the previous reviews here have discussed the plot of My Name is Khan, so I won't rehash it here.

I'm not a fan of Bollywood movies, but my interest in My Name is Khan (a movie I had never heard of before) was piqued by an article I recently read about Shah Rukh Khan following his recent detainment while entering the US. Rather than the usual garish musical spectacle, it sounded as though My Name is Khan would be a serious film that explored some important issues of relevance in post-9/11 America.

Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was that the protagonist of My Name is Khan is a man with Asperger Syndrome, a form of autism. This was something the article I'd read failed to mention, giving his statement ""My name is Khan, and I'm not a terrorist"" quite a different context than if it were coming from a ""normal"" person. That is, it became less of a political statement, and more of the kind of obsessive attention to a subject that is frequently cited as one of the signs of Asperger's.

Oddly enough, watching this film illuminated for me some of the conceits of Hollywood films through its own conceits. For example, some of the portrayals of Americans in My Name is Khan are rather stereotypical; then again, Hollywood has portrayed people from other parts of the world through stereotypes for decades. Another example is the television news graphics, particularly the ones connected with the election of President Obama, whose name is strictly avoided; thus, we get the oddly worded ""First African American President"" on-screen graphics, which I never saw on any actual broadcast during the election. The inauthenticity of this actually took me out of my suspension of disbelief--as did the depiction of the fictional town of Wilhelmina, Georgia, which looks like no American town I've ever seen. Here again, the television news graphics depicted, with their references to ""Georgia State"", briefly took me out of my suspension of disbelief. And, let us not forget the absurdity of any group of Americans having no problem whatsoever understanding a speaker who is speaking primarily in Hindi--which is really not so absurd when you think of any number of Hollywood movies in which Europeans converse entirely in English, albeit sometimes with accents.

Those distractions aside, I found My Name is Khan to be a surprisingly moving story. Despite my best efforts, I became teary-eyed in a few spots towards the end of the movie, something which rarely happens when I watch movies.

Some have complained that My Name is Khan is ""preachy"" and ""self-serving"", and one review on Amazon actually (if improbably) reduces it to ""feel-good leftist pro-Muslim anti-American pro-Obama anti-Bush Bollywood propaganda that successfully rivals 1930-s Soviet state propaganda films.[sic]"" Granted, in many ways, the movie is a bit simplistic. But, in that respect, it is no less offensive than many Hollywood movies that have been less than subtle in trying to convey messages. (Actually, the comparison made in another review to Forrest Gump is probably more appropriate.)

At the same time, though, the movie does not exempt its own characters from examination. Witness Khan's brother's objection to his marriage on the basis that his bride-to-be is not Muslim, which echoes the Hindu-Muslim tensions witnessed during the brothers' youth; or his wife's emotionally fraught conclusion that the tragedy which has befallen them is because of her husband's Muslim name. Though perhaps not as obvious to American sensibilities, it's clear that the makers of this movie aren't limiting their awareness of prejudice and intolerance to Americans.

It is worth mentioning briefly that the casting of CNN commentator Fareed Zakaria as a radical Muslim cleric is a nice bit of casting against type. And Zakaria does surprisingly well as portraying the anger of the character.

At its heart, though, My Name is Khan is a love story. The main character's narrative consists of letters he writes to his wife as he makes is way around the US in hopes of meeting the president so he can tell him that ""my name is Khan, and I'm not a terrorist."" This journey, of course, is the one he has undertaken in hopes that his wife will take him back after the tragedy that has torn them apart.

I really have only two criticisms of this movie. One is the Wilhelmina, Georgia subplot. Though I understand how it fits into the movie, it often feels like a gratuitous diversion. The other is that it's probably 30 minutes too long. Particularly during the Wilhelmina sequences, I found my attention starting to wander.

But, overall, I found My Name is Khan to be quite good. I would definitely recommend seeing it at least once.",1335139200,,4713,4.946902654867257
4132796,2,B003K02EV0,"Totally improbable plot that goes for easy emotional release.  Preaches to the converted, we all know that not all muslims are terrorists and we all know that in every society there is a fringe that is still tribal and takes any excuse to harass the different in this case the muslims are easy targets but U.S. society should not be condemned as a whole for the actions of a tiny minority of bigots and miscreants.  The center piece of the story is the killing of the stepson of our hero by a group of playground bullies, but we know bullies take any excuse and if the kid was gay, mexican, muslim, or just weird he would have given them an excuse to be attacked, so the film overblows an incident that even though is very condemnable it is still commonplace in any society not beacuse of racism but because there are bullies.  I found the central character or ""hero"" to be annoying, kind of a Indian-Muslim Forrest Gump and I was not a fan of the original Forrest Gump which is a character of irony while in this movie is just preachy.  The only rescuable aspect was the mosque scene in which Khan confronts the islam radical preacher and tells him that islam is in reality a religion of peace which as all religions I believe it is.  In this scene we see the real reason for extremism is not a sense of moral outrage or religious introspection but simply machismo, this is the macho muslims are comfronted and in their minds treated with contempt by the rest of society being Jews, Christians, savage Hindus, etc. and they have to retalliate to alliviate their sense of hurt pride and diminished manhood.  To be honest those are the same reasons people become Communists, Radical Islamists, Radical White Power, etc. just a sense of intollerance brought about by resentment and envy of people that in their concept have a better position in life without deserving it and that is called Social Resentment.

4132809,5,B003K02EV0,"<strong>My Name Is Khan</strong> (Karan Johar, 2010)

I have terrifying, terrifying images in my head of Hollywood attempting to remake <em>My Name Is Khan</em>. First off, the Bollywood original runs two hours and forty-one minutes. This would be untenable in any culture in which Harvey ""ninety minutes and out"" Weinstein is a player, so of course we'd lose a few subplots. (We might actually lose the main plot. I've seen a couple of Asian-horror-film remakes that came bloody close to losing the main plot.) But imagine all the time you could save by doing what Hollywood does best: emotional shortcuts.

If you've read my movie reviews for any length of time, you've heard me going off about Hollywood's use of emotional shortcuts, which has by this time gotten so endemic that I can't remember the last mainstream Hollywood-studio-distributed movie I saw that didn't contain them as a substitute for real characterization. (This is why today's monthly update of my thousand-best-films-ever list's twelve changes--including <em>My Name Is Khan</em>, which entered the list at #160--saw eight foreign films, three American movies made well outside the Hollywood machine, and one pre-emotional-shortcut Hollywood film enter the list, and twelve modern mainstream Hollywood films leave it.) Let me give you a quick example of what I'm talking about here. <em>My Name Is Khan</em> contains a minor character named Abdul, who runs a store in San Francisco selling televisions. Once he's introduced, which doesn't happen until relatively late in the film, we see a number of scenes in which Abdul features, though he's never the center of the scene. As we progress, we get that Abdul, who in post-9/11 America is basically shunned for being a Muslim, is getting more and more frustrated with the world around him. Finally, in the first scene in which Abdul <em>does</em> take center stage, he absolutely blows his top, storms out onto the street and starts accosting middle-class white folks, confronting them with his Muslim-ness. It's an absolutely hysterical scene, and it works because we've had time to get to know Abdul and his situation. Now, in a Hollywood remake, the ten minutes or so of collected Abdul scenes which are spread over about an hour of this flick would be conflated into a single scene--the one in which Khan himself stumbles by Abdul's shop and sees footage of a massive hurricane hitting the coast of Georgia (which, in the main plotline, sends Khan running back to Georgia to help some friends he has down there). Assuming Abdul was kept in the film at all, naturally, all the buildup of Abdul's frustration would be cut down to one customer's Meaningful Look(TM), probably a suspicious narrowing of the eyes, accompanied by a subtle ominous cue in the soundtrack. These two things will combine to tell you that Abdul is Suspicious (or, at least, considered so by everyone else in the movie). And yes, as the incredible success of hundreds of mainstream American movies every year will tell you, the emotional shortcut method DOES play in Des Moines, often to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues. But ask yourself the question: would you rather allow yourself to be manipulated by a narrowing of the eyes and a musical cue, or would it be preferable for you to be given more detail about Abdul and make up your own mind?

If you prefer the latter, I cannot begin to recommend <em>My Name Is Khan</em> enough. There are so many superlatives I want to use to describe this movie that I'm not sure where to begin, so I may as well start with the opening scene. I am a big, big advocate of using unknown actors in high-profile roles, because all too often, the meta--the stuff we know about a film star's off-camera life--tends to overwhelm the character. You can't look at Tom Cruise these days without thinking about him jumping on the couch, right? Well, the opening scene of this movie is a stunning exception. Shah Rukh Khan basically <em>is</em> a Bollywood version of Tom Cruise, one of the Indian film industry's most famous, and recognizable, exports. And the first sequence of this movie is a horrifying ten-minute journey through the TSA (Transportation Safety Authority, for those of you outside the US--the people who have added two hours to your wait time at American airports) system at SFO as Rizvan Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan, natch; I'll try not to let the last-name confusion go any farther than this), a man with severe Asperger's Syndrome, is pulled out of line, herded into a small room, searched, and ridiculed. And the fact that this is one of Bollywood's biggest actors puts that seed in our heads: ""if this can happen to Shah Rukh Kahn, this can happen to <em>anyone</em>"". It's a [censored for Amazon consumption] gamble, and it pays off in spades.

But that wouldn't be enough to make this film as good as it is by itself, naturally; you've still got two and a half hours of movie after that, and while there are a number of other actors whose presence here must (and will) be noted, this movie is all Shah Rukh Khan. I grant you, the Asperger's suffered by Rizvan in this movie is extreme, and it's one of the few places where the movie exaggerates for effect. (I note this because the movie's otherwise restrained feel is very surprising in a big-budget Bollywood blockbuster; I was very pleasantly surprised.) But that said, once you get past the initial ""this is kind of exaggerated, here..."", and start digesting how well Khan is playing this part, the wow factor just plain soars. Even if the film had been nothing but a character sketch/road movie, which the end of that first sequence points to if you're used to Hollywood movies and their linear plots, Khan's performance alone would have propelled this into the stratosphere.

It's not just a character sketch/road movie, though it is that. It is also a romantic drama (I can't think of the last Bollywood film I saw that didn't have a romance element to it), and here's where I can finally find a way to segue from superlatives into an actual plot synopsis: Rizvan Khan is originally in that little room because he has been charged by his wife, Mandira (<em>Ishq</em>'s Kajol), with meeting President George W. Bush and delivering him the message: ""my name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist."" While we can guess at the broadest idea of why this is from the very moment he says it (Rizvan is a Muslim in post-9/11 America), the movie shuttles back and forth between Khan's often amusing journey, which takes place from late 2007 to early 2010, around the country trying to track down the president and deliver his message, to the past, from the early-eighties Hindu-Muslim riots in India, to the climactic event in 2007 that causes Mandira to charge him with the task at hand. In the process, Shibani Bathija's (<em>Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna</em>) script tackles a <em>hell</em> of a lot of weighty issues. You'd think Asperger's Syndrome, 9/11, and the Hindu-Muslim riots would be enough. You'd be wrong. (I already mentioned the hurricane, and if you pay attention to those dates, you'll notice an historic presidential election in there as well.) Now, we've all seen any number of Hollywood films that tried to tackle a single one of those issues--9/11. And I don't know about you, but I haven't seen a single one that's gotten it right yet. (The closest of them was Spike Lee's impressionist take on ""we will rebuild"" in <em>25th Hour</em>.) Perhaps it takes a sympathetic outsider's eye to examine such things? God knows we're still too close to it, thanks to still-unending media coverage. Bathija--who often teams with director Karan Johar--is one mean talent. That said, one of the places the movie does fail is in some of the English dialogue (especially in a hospital scene about two-thirds of the way through the film); having a native speaker take a quick look over the script, a larger portion of which is in English than is usual in Bollywood productions, to check such things as idiom would have been a really, really good idea here.

Johar ain't so bad himself. He's either produced, directed, or both a string of Bollywood blockbusters over the past fifteen years (including <em>Kal Ho Naa Ho</em>, another favorite of mine, and another film where SRK gives a fine performance) that any producer/director on this side of the pond would be proud to have under his belt. I think he may be slightly better as a producer than a director; at one hundred sixty-one minutes, this is actually on the short side for Bollywood, and there are still a few places, though they are rare, where the direction seems to lose its way for a minute or two and the pace slips. But they are few, and forgivable, especially to American eyes--which are generally unused to seeing a movie with this much energy applied for such an extended period of time.

Okay, I've already gone on way too long about this movie (word count tells me I was at 1,513 at the end of the last paragraph) and I haven't even mentioned the strong supporting cast, which includes a number of solid American character actors you'll likely recognize (Katie Amanda Keane, Benny Nieves, and Kenton Duty all have meaty roles) as well as some bigger names in America (<em>Deadgirl</em>'s Kathleen Darcy pops up in a small role, while the always-wonderful Jennifer Echols, who's been providing comic relief in Hollywood since <em>Save the Last Dance</em>, gets what may be the largest role of her career). Nor a number of other facets of the film (the soundtrack plays more like that of an American film, rather than the cast breaking out into those big Bollywood dance numbers, which was a welcome surprise) that range from the notable to the praiseworthy. While the film does have a few flaws I mentioned above, it's still one of the best movies I've seen in years. Highly recommended. **** ",1327449600,,9885,4.841513897102306

The director tries all ways to portray this lead character as empathetic and intelligent individual with a syndrome, which actually makes movie silly and rather dishonest. After drenching people with hugely exaggerated emotional drama, the lead character in the movie takes up the responsibility to make America know that people with names ending with Khan are not terrorists, because he was mistreated due to his name. However, he never tries to tell the other side of story, which indirectly suggesting that Muslims condone the violence done by Islamic extremists and it's okay to do so.

This movie is purely commercial and aimed at Muslim community. There is no truth or valid argument in this movie about anything, but still this movie got great reviews by some people just because they want to be politically correct.

4132846,5,B003K02EV0,"It's not subtle. A 13 year old can appreciate the film's black and white morality just fine. Nor is it particularly realistic. Instead, it reminds me of Capra's classics that some have derided as too ""Capra-corny"": It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, etc.

But in spite of these drawbacks, it may end up being the most life-changing movie I've seen in decades. I haven't known what to do, or even what to say to a couple of friends who have just lost their teenage child. What can you say when their grief is so deep? After seeing this, I may get them a copy of this movie, since it handles such monumental losses with a perfect touch.

I'm a Christian, and I've had many direct experiences of Christ's power and love. But like many Christians, my faith has grown a little stale. I sense that I'm no longer the Christian I once was, especially when I look at my actions. To paraphrase Sister Helen Prejean, ""I discover what I REALLY believe by carefully observing what I actually do.""

Nobody is really as saintly as Khan is in this movie. Still, I was convicted by what God was trying to tell me through this movie: that He'd be happier with me if I were a Muslim, as long as I were that kind of Muslim, than He is now pleased with me as a Christian. What a wake up call!

Realistically, there are no good people or bad people, as even the worst people have plenty of good in them, and even the most saintly are deeply flawed. But even if the film's morality is more appropriate for children, it is still very helpful to me.

I'm no racist, but I still struggle against my human tendencies toward racism, xenophobia, and other forms of prejudice. Now I have this film to help me in my struggle. Whenever I start thinking, ""All women..."", or ""All Japanese..."", etc.,  then all I have to do is to remember the lesson of the film -- that good people and bad people are found in ALL groups.

We Christians ought to be shining examples to inspire the world. Instead, it's secular movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pay-It-Forward/dp/B00005B4BI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pay It Forward</a>&nbsp;and secular books like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Cups-of-Tea-One-Man-s-Mission-to-Promote-Peace-One-School-at-a-Time/dp/0143038257/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace . . .

4132847,5,B003K02EV0,"I just finished watching a rented copy of this movie and logged on to purchase it for my son who is studying theatre.  I've read some of the negative reviews and I hope those reviewers get a chance to view the movie again, maybe in a few months.  It takes time for new ideas to sink in and for minds to open and embrace change.  Using aspergers to frame an understanding of experiences is genius - Khan understands language more literally than most people and has a more difficult time picking up social cues and expressing himself.  He also dislikes touch which makes the romance underlying the film both sweet and also comical - helpful in offsetting the many serious issues.  Having been taught right from wrong in very beautiful and simple scenes between the wonderful actress playing his mother and the talented young actor playing the young Khan, he has strong values which help him face prejudice stemming from his aspergers, his looks, and his religion.

The movie is a bit over the top, managing to work in school bullying, sibling rivalry, immigration, identification of aspergers (his sister-in-law is a professor of psychology - maybe that could have been handled in a more natural subtle way), living as an adult with aspergers (employment, relationships, parenting), single motherhood, 9/11 and the racism that followed and the wars, death of a child, terrorism, media coverage, a Katrina-like storm in a tiny southern town (although I loved those scenes), and even the 2008 election and meeting the president.  While the movie could have made the same points in a simpler way by focusing on just one or two geographic areas, it was very entertaining and touching.  And pulling in all the different topics made it easier to see how most people have some prejudices, even though they only recognize the prejudices of the people who hurt them.

I loved the music, particularly using ""We shall overcome,"" in multiple languages.  Music is so powerful and finding common ground in music can bring people together.  I also loved the several parts of the movie where people came together to worship although they were from different faiths.

I recommend this film for families with older children.  There are several languages spoken with subtitles in sections which makes it a perfect movie for older children who haven't been exposed to a variety of cultures.  And everyone, young and old, can benefit from a reminder that the only real difference between people that matters is whether they do good deeds or bad.",1296345600,2,2522,4.903529411764706
4132848,4,B003K02EV0,"The writeup on the cover is somewhat misleading. This movie is about tolerance and intolerance, both between faiths and cultures and within those faiths (well, within Islam). No one is spared - Muslims, Christians, Hindus - but the treatment is also balanced. It's a feel-good movie, but there's also a dose of tragedy, from 9/11 and its results.

Khan is a moderate Muslim with Asperger's Syndrome. He's a genius at repairing things, but is frightened of loud sounds and the color yellow, and has trouble expressing his feelings, although he can fall in love.

The movie is structured so that we find out gradually why he's on his trip across America. This was well done, and keeps us waiting to find out more. We are shown his childhood and how his condition affects him. He takes things literally, always tells the truth, and has a seemingly eidetic memory, and this is a source of humor throughout the movie.

He falls for a Hindu woman and, to the chagrin of his ""more devout"" brother, marries her. But he is no less devout, carrying out his required prayer times no matter where he happens to be. He has been taught by his mother that there are only two kinds of people - those who do good, and those who do evil. This is how he sees the world.

We are shown the tragic consequences of 9/11, leading to suspicion and hatred towards Muslims. This was a bit heavy-handed, as the reality in the States was very different from what would be expected in the rest of the world, considering the video of Muslim children laughing and cheering the death and destruction of 9/11, an image of demented hatred. For example, the movie only shows the resulting bigotry, but not the concerted efforts throughout the country to show kindness and acceptance to Muslims post-9/11, even towns neighborhoods offering free meals to them. There is a call for moderate Muslims to be proud of their faith, showing educated women once again proud to wear their hijab. And there is a call to root out the jihadist elements from within Islam.

In the movie, their business falters because of the Khan name attached to it. I cannot speak for Muslims who may have experienced this, but it seemed to me fictional, since I would not have guessed that ""Khan"" was a Muslim name, nor would I have expected most Americans to.

At some point Khan is arrested, and supposedly tortured (with alternating heat and cold). This is may or not be true. Our rules don't even allow for shouting at detainees, or playing rock music, so offhand I would judge this as fictional, as some movies falsely portray Gitmo (e.g. Harold and Kumar), but I can take this either way, as he's not treated as badly as regular prisoners would be treated in European prisons.

At the end of the movie, a wise fool finally meets an educated fool, althought the irony of this may be lost on most viewers.

All in all, an uplifting movie, albeit centered in his personal tragedy. It's funny and sad and inspirational and worth discussing.",1296345600,,2978,4.64828897338403

Overview:

This film is about a gentleman named: Rizwan Khan (Shahrukh Khan). He is a muslim from the Borivali area of Mumbai, India. He suffers from Asperger's syndrome, a form of high-functioning autism. This syndrome affects the way that he relates to the world and those around him. On the positive side, he can solve word puzzles and remember large portions of texts, word for word easily.

On the negative side, this syndrome causes him to get confused easily and he repeats certain phases continually, which can cause persons to misunderstand him. He regularly makes it a point to make sure that his surname is pronounced correctly.
Eventually he meets a single hindu mother and manages to woo her to marry him.

Plot Points:

This film attempts to probe into the difficulties experienced by minorities, here are the different minority areas that are covered:

- persons with disabilities
- immigrant groups
- religious groups
- mixed religions in marriage
- racial minorities

Their lives are quite turbulent at points as they are severely misunderstood and their son is viciously persecuted.

Conclusion:

While this film may seem far fetched at points, and a bit self serving and overdone, it brings to the forefront many issues that some persons within our society face everyday. The objective of this film in my opinion is to raise the bar of tolerance that we have for our fellow human being.",1292544000,25,1420,4.957805907172996

If you are considering purchasing or watching this film, let me save you a few dollars and three hours that you will never get back by summarizing the film for you. ...  There are two types of people in this world... good people, and George W. Bush.
The whole premise of the movie had to do with the religious intolerance that Islamic people face, and it shoved that in your face the entire film all while portraying every Caucasian in the film as a racist redneck.
I did give it two stars because the hurricane scene was one of the most entertaining scenes in cinema for its sheer stupidity alone.  Khan sees that  hurricane is striking this little town in Georgia while he is in LA.  He then proceeds to get on a bus to go help the poor people of this town (because they were being neglected by George Bush).  When he arrives the hurricane is still occurring. (a trip of over two days according to greyhound.com)  On top of this when his friends and family see him on the news helping this little town, they all come to help and  the hurricane is STILL happening.  Evidently George Bush with the assistance of his evil weather machine parked this hurricane on this poor little town in Georgia for days on end. To make matters worse he apparently prevented the red cross, churches and other non government entities that normally assist in these situations, from helping as well because when Khan arrives these people are just laying around in a church with open festering wounds.

4132879,5,B003K02EV0,"I was just reading a few reviews of this movie.  I'm very tired - jetlagged - and this opinion I'm expressing here is ""off the top of my head"" so please excuse the odd ""error"" or ""inconsistancy"".

I read in one review ""mentally handicapped"" and ""retarded"" - which just shows how poorly some people understand autism (I have Asperger's Syndrome).

Socially of course - that might be the case.  Then again - we live in a world of war and terror, of bullying and slavery ... and if one gets rid of the ""mentally handicapped"" autistic people - those things won't go away.  Everybody has a part to play in these things.  I'd suggest we're all ""mentally handicapped"" to allow such things to happen (gladly as we do as we all partake in the scavenged rewards) - or really such things are acceptable to us as part of our normal-functioning and we just like to pretend they're bad, for appearances and our perceived social status - the most important thing to most of us.

This movie is claimed by some to oversimplify things - e.g. regarding political posturing and the like.

They're right of course.

My point of view however is of a benign Aspie (person with Asperger's Syndrome).  I like people.  I do tend to see things in ""black and white"".  All people are imperfect.  We are all grey.  I think I'm safe in stating that.  There is conflict between my instinctive view of people, and my intellectual understanding of them.

I like this film because it chimes with my instinctive view and also addresses ""justice"" - often an important concept to Aspie's.

Let's face it - if people are not fundumentally altered with gene therapy, and are allowed freedoms, then we are always going to have conflict, prejudice, hypocrasy, tragedy, expoitation ... we are all part of the problemS in some form or other.  No amount of education is going to fundumentally change our humanity in a long-term persistent manner that's logically consistent accross differing contexts. We live in a social hierarchy based on power structure.  Some societies are perhaps more morale and successful in ""fair structure"" over-all than others.  I could go into the philosophy of morality or the meaning of logic or the validity of mathematical axioms - but this isn't really the place to do so.

This film does require a suspension of disbelief.  It does look at things rather simply - as someone with Asperger's might prefer to - or at least I would prefer to do so as a key thing about Autism is that every person with autism is very individual and more resistent to societal meme's.  Some things in life - some actions and stances by people or people(s) are particularly bad.  Some are particularly good.  It's comforting when there is clarity.  This film is over-simplified fiction - and I think quite wonderful.  Perhaps a particular mindset is required to properly appreciate its position - concepts possibly alien and incomprehensible to many.

I like it.  It made me cry.

Nb - I came accross these reviews as part of a partially related search - I haven't seen the blu-ray movie - only the cinematic presentation several months ago.  Also, if I recall, this film sits in a series of films intended to educate about various [and often poorly understood] ""disabilities"".  Autism is extremely complex and difficult to understand - I've spent the last two years trying to understand it and despite my intelligence, intellectual insights / academic training and ability, and experience of having Asperger's Syndrome and meeting many others with the condition, I still only vaguely understand it at best. There's a saying regarding Autism: approx. ""After you've met one person with Autism, you've met one person with Autism"".

It is just too much. The acting by Shahrukh Khan is also too much. You can see he is acting and no good actor should look like they are acting. They need to look like they are truly the character they are portraying. Some of the scenes were painful to watch and bordered at sheer embarrassing.

A man living in turbulent times and circumstances, afflicted with a difficult handicap, goes to extraordinary lengths for the woman he cannot stop loving. All the rest is background, albeit entertaining background.

While I found the different point of view (that of Muslims and Hindus in America) interesting and enlightening, no one should take the political and/or social aspects of this movie seriously other than to view them as educational. It's simply part of the setting. That's why no one attempted to DO them very seriously...because they were background to the plot, they were not the plot itself. This is not a failed front for a social/political documentary. It's an extraordinarily successful, beautiful, and sensitive love story.

Ironically, though the movie is about Muslims and Hindus and not a mention is made of the Christian religion in the entire film (other than to show a couple of non-religious scenes in a church), there is a powerful Christian message (probably common to most religions): that love heals and hatred destroys, and that character and moral courage (not bravado) are what make real men.

It's sad that no one has thought to praise the remarkable performance of Shahrukh Khan, who portrays a man afflicted with Aspberger's Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism. Khan is at a disadvantage: Had Dustin Hoffman never done Rainman, nor Leonardo DiCaprio given us his amazing performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Khan's portrayal of Risvan Khan might have been given the considerable respect it deserves. As it is, in my view he still excels the others in one respect: he manages to infuse charm, high intelligence, and even sexiness into his very convincing portrayal of a disability generally not thought of as very sexy.

The charm and comedy of this movie are irresistible. The chemistry between the leading actors is legendary in India (they've made at least 5 movies together). The directing is flawless, the acting top-rate, the photography excellent, the music lively and compelling. One note about the music: it's ethnic (hence Indian), which means it's not what American audiences are used to hearing. But if you can get past the culture shock, you may do as I did and end up loving it enough to buy the CD.

There is enough action to keep even my husband, who loves nothing more than to see buildings blowing up, interested. When asked if there are very many subtitles to read, I told my daughter there were some, but not enough to distract from the movie. Only when I watched it a second time did I realize there are subtitles throughout most of it (I was too absorbed to even realize I was reading subtitles most of the time. Hint: use the Pause button as needed). I was riveted throughout the entire movie and never found a single moment boring. In fact, I was surprised at how fast the time had gone. And when the movie was over, even my action-loving husband said, ""I'm not sure, but that may be the best movie I've ever seen.""

For parents: This movie does not contain nudity, sex scenes (although the word ""sex"" is mentioned), nor does it contain anything crude. There is some violence, but it's not pervasive, nor is it graphic. And here's a wonderfully refreshing twist: the couple actually marries before sleeping together! My husband did think he heard the F word in one scene, but I've watched the movie twice and didn't hear it; so if it's in there, it's not obvious.",1286150400,16,3553,4.854785478547854

4132887,5,B003K02EV0,"MY NAME IS KHAN is a rather long journey of a film - almost as long the journey depicted in the movie.  At three hours in length it may lose some viewers, but for those who stay until the end, the message is larger than life and very important.  Especially now, as the world grapples with multiple wars based on differences of beliefs under the flag of 'religion'.  As written by Shibani Bathija and Nirajan Iyengar this is a tale of growing to understand and embrace tolerance on many levels.  The main character, Khan, in many ways represents Everyman - a human being, imperfect in the eyes of the world because he has Asperger's Syndrome, who discovers the meaning of love and the importance of tolerance so necessary if this world is to stay intact.

We first meet Rizwan Khan, an outsider because of his variations from normal due to his Asperger's Syndrome, living with his Muslim mother Razia (Zarina Wahab) and younger brother Zakir: Zakir is gifted and at age 18 leaves Mumbai to move to  San Francisco for a new beginning. When Razia dies she makes Khan promise her that he will make a good life - that there are no differences in people except good and bad.  Khan (Shahrukh Khan) moves to San Francisco, coping with his disabilities as best he can, finds work with in a cosmetic firm selling lotions and potions for his brother Zakir (Jimmy Shergill).  One of the reasons Khan is successful as a salesman is his utter honesty, and this trait finds an admirer in cosmetologist Mendira (Kajol) who eventually, through a courtship that is as special as any ever filmed, agrees to marry Khan.  Zakir condemns the marriage (Mendira is Hindu, Khan Muslim) and will not accept the couple in his and his wife Hasina's (Sonya Jehan) home. Mendira has a young son from a former marriage and that son finds friendship that eventually betrays him: the world of the Bay Area is sick with the aftermath of 9/11 and all Muslims are suspect and disrespected.  When Mendira's son is brutally beaten to death, the Hindu Mendira blames herself for marrying a Muslim Khan, and tells his to leave, that the only way she will ever see him again is after he has met with the President of the US to say 'My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist.'

Mendira stays in her home struggling with the fact that her son's murderers cannot be found.  Khan sets out to travel across the country, attempting to meet the President and deliver his message so that Mendira will take him back. His journey is an examination of human kindness - he is supported by an African American Georgia family Mama Jenny (Jennifer Echols) when he helps her son, and in turn when a hurricane destroys Mama Jenny's home, Khan returns to help her rebuild, an act that is televised and encourages many Muslims (including Zakir and Hasina) to offer help in the catastrophe.  There are many other sidebar stories that occur during Khan's mission to greet the President, each an example of how important communication and equality is life we are to dwell on one planet.  Yes, the ending is somewhat saccharine, but the eyes won't likely remain dry as the credits roll.

Sharukh Khan is extraordinary as Khan and the supporting cast is very strong, especially the beautiful and talented Kajol.  Though there are flaws present, the overriding effect of the story diminishes them to the point of being inconsequential. This is a very beautiful film, one that do well being viewed by every one on the earth!  Grady Harp, September 10",1285545600,6,3483,4.6557911908646

4132890,4,B003K02EV0,"What, Kajol and Shah Rukh together again on cinema after nearly ten years? And Karan Johar again directing them? O happy day. Okay, I did fleetingly think - when I first eyeballed the movie's title - that, oboy, Shah Rukh Khan had finally let his ego get to him. But, it turns out, this title MY NAME IS KHAN is quite relevant to the story. I think that Shah Rukh is a hell of an actor, except he'd always been hampered (and pigeonholed) with those showy romantic lead roles. So it's real nice that, in the past few years, as he's gotten older, he's begun to stretch himself (SWADES, CHAK DE INDIA!, RAB NE BANA DI JODI). And Kajol is Kajol. Whereas Shah Rukh's instincts lean toward flashiness and the expansive gesture, Kajol gets a lot of stuff done with her more minimal, more unaffected performance. Of course, you get drawn to that irresistible spirit of hers, and those stormy eyes.

Shah Rukh plays Rizvan Khan, a Muslim Indian with a knack for fixing broken objects. Rizvan is afflicted with Asperger's Syndrome, thus rendering him a highly functional autistic. He's easily discomfited by sharp sounds and by the color yellow, and forget about eye contact. Sponsored by his brother, Rizvan makes a new life in San Francisco and begins working for his brother's company, selling his Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products (the pamphlet boasts that women using these products will ""shine like a newly wedded bride""). Given his condition, Rizvan is often frightened, and peace of mind doesn't truly arrive until he meets Mandira (Kajol), a lovely, effervescent single mother. He hawks his wares to her; they become friends. It's a start.

It should be noted that Kajol has never required Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products to glow like a newly wedded bride.

That legendary spark between them is still there, still effortless and considerable. Whenever it's just Shah Rukh and Kajol interacting, the movie is really good. Both actors are marvelous in constructing their slow burn relationship, and it's key that you buy into their romance, especially in Rizvan's affection for Mandira. It's his love for her, after all, which drives the plot and which continually urges him on in his monumental journey. I don't know how true to life SRK's performance is of someone with Asperger's Syndrome, but you instantly sympathize with Rizvan even as you acclimate to his quirky, jarring mannerisms.

Where the film falters at times is when it tries to get on message. No rhapsodic singing and dancing in this one. Director Karan Johar is trying for something else here. In its production values and technical execution, MY NAME IS KHAN is very polished. And yet it can't quite get away from all the Bollywood tropes. The story has things to impart concerning religious differences and racial intolerance (and profiling) in a post-9/11 climate. Except that sometimes, as scenes play out, the message is delivered in a heavyhanded or overwrought fashion. Note the really cringe-worthy sequence in Georgia when Rizvan first meets ""Mama Jenny"" and ""Funny Hair Joel."" The film also suggests that there are only two kinds of people: good people and bad people. That is a hell of an oversimplification. Life inhabits plenty of gray areas. Another thing that bugged me is would Rizvan's brother really have deployed his autistic brother out in the streets by himself to sell products? That is a seriously callous move.

Rizvan wins Mandira, but then loses her. To win her back, he embarks on a cross-country odyssey which gains prominence in the film's second half. Rizvan's journey is fraught with effective sequences but also with moments that oversell themselves. I love that SRK and Kajol have reunited, and I'm happy that that magical rapport is still present (and it must suck to be Ajay Devgan whenever his wife Kajol and SRK have a movie out). Only, a bit more restraint on the director's part would have done wonders. Still, flaws and all, I recommend this film. It's got a good heart and is worth at least 3.5 out of 5 stars.

The DVD extras: ""Changing the Face of Bollywood"" has director Karan Johar and SRK reflecting on the globalization of Indian cinema (00:04:47 minutes long); ""Working Together"" explores that heady chemistry between SRK and Kajol and how they are viewed as THE romantic film couple by Indian cinema-goers (00:04:38); ""The Music Of MY NAME IS KHAN"" - how the songs were carefully selected for soulfulness and spirituality - no flashy item numbers, please (00:02:48); ""The Story of MY NAME IS KHAN"" focuses on the film's story premise, that of one simple, innocent man changing the perceptions of those around him (00:06:03); the ""Sajda"" music promo (00:01:32) and the ""Tee Naina"" music promo (00:01:32).",1283731200,5,4711,4.926952141057934

My Name is Khan is clearly one of the best films I've seen this year.  Period.  The performances by Shahrukh Khan and Kajol are stellar and if there is any justice the film should at least receive an Oscar nod as Best Foreign Film.

But I want to touch upon the notion that several reviewers have mentioned that the scenes in Georgia were unnecessary.  I disagree.  Those scenes were there to emphasize that Rizwan completely adhered to the lesson that his mother taught him that there were only two kinds of people in the world; good and bad.  To the point of setting his own personal journey aside, he felt to need to help ""good"" people that were in trouble.  How could we capture that notion any better than having him come to the aid of another group of people that were be subjected to the discrimination that he was feeling?

Is some of it over the top and/or unrealistic?  No more than the action film characters that survive exploding cars and jumps from rooftops with little or no harm to their bodies.  It's a movie, people.

All films paint certain characters with broad strokes to move the story along.  Most of those stereotypical characters are based on some exaggeration of the truth.  I am an African American woman who like Mama Jenny is a ""little fat"".  I was not offended by anything in the movie at all.  She was portrayed as a caring and warm person.  And anyone that thinks that areas like that don't exist in American anymore have not traveled off of the main roads.  People are forgetting that the main character has Asperger's.  His description of Joel and his hair is something an autistic person may say.  My nephew is autistic.  He is very literal with observations. He doesn't think about the political correctness of his statement before he speaks. But again, it is a movie, people.

My only complaint would be the one I have with all Hindi movies that portray Americans.  I can always tell that they are British actors.  There were two actors I immediately recognized from US TV shows; Tonya Lee Williams as the African American newscaster and Christopher B. Duncan as President Obama.  But Tonya is actually British too.  The actress playing Mama Jenny, Jennifer Echols, has made many appearances on TV; Dexter, ER, The Shield, Nip/Tuck, My Name is Earl, etc.  And the kid playing Joel, Adrian Kali Turner, has been on Chuck, Numb3rs, Flashforward and iCarly.  So, it looks like they went with American actors for the most of the African American characters at least.

My minor complaint aside, this film is well worth the time spent.  Great job by everyone involved.  Great message if you are willing to listen.",1282608000,25,2676,4.717062634989201

4132895,4,B003K02EV0,"The film `My Name Is Khan' is a drama, inspirational love story and contemporary social commentary dealing with the highly emotional subject of racial profiling and the current enmity and distrust between Muslims and America citizenry at large. Definitely not the usual fair for two of Bollywood's greatest stars, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who are better known for dancing and singing their way into the hearts of their millions of fans worldwide. However the magic that occurs in front of the camera whenever these two come together is just as noticeable in `My Name Is Khan' as it is in any of their other many memorable collaborations.

Anyone familiar with Hindi cinema has long come to the realization that there is a vast cultural difference in the understanding of the nature of time between East and West. While the American filmmaker is known to be rather terse with the amount of time to be spent on plot development, Indian filmmakers relish in the thought of drawing out every subtle nuance available to them. This film is no exception to the rule, running 2 hours and 45 minutes long it will surely be a chore for many and unfortunately there is a rather lengthy period in the middle of the movie that is excruciatingly slow which will cause many viewers to lose focus and interest. However for those with the stamina to stick it out they will be rewarded. In the last hour everything starts to fall into place, the action speeds up and an emotional angst begins to build that will really draw you in.

Shah Rukh Khan does a good job of playing his character. I am not familiar with Asperger Syndrome so I am not sure how people would act or react to others and situations given their circumstances. So I wonder if SRK went over the top as usual? I was disappointed with Kajol's performance. She too over plays her characters and comes off looking and sounding annoying. They make a good on screen couple but I think she is way overrated as a Bollywood actress. I like her when she is subdued. Her voice irritates me when she gets excited (which is most of the time in most of her films) but she improved slightly closer to the end of the film.

  I don't know how to say how bad this film is.  How does someone take a serious subject and make a joke of it. There are so many WTF moments in this film.  1983 listed as the year when Hindu-Muslim riots took place in Mumbai? Huh? SRK's Rizwan ventures into a make-believe Georgia town in the South where the African-American folks act and behave in a manner that made me wonder if Rizwan had time-travelled as well! Straight out of a 50s film then, Mama Jennie (stereotypically Big Momma) and her son Funny Hair Joel (oh, come on) offer Rizwan shelter and women's dressing. In return, he mouths an eulogy that makes those present sing an acapella to the tune of Hum Honge Kamyaab! Rizwan is back on his journey following this WTF diversion. But there are plenty more WTFs in store, including one that causes him to return to Big Momma's ole town and rescue its people from a hurricane that is curiously dangerous enough for locals to be unable to get out of it but just enough for outsiders to get in! So there are no army choppers in sight to rescue, but enough choppers to cover the rescue operation engineered by Rizwan that puts his earlier bicycle use to greater effect! See how it all comes around! Ain't it a clever screenplay? As for the acting Kajol is so screechy its like she thought she was acting in an entirely different film.  SRK plays Rizwan like a caricature of a man with Asperger disease.

I typically would die to watch a Karan Johar film, whether it was Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna or Kabhi Khusi Kabhi Gham, but this film is nothing like his previous films.

I'm hoping that the Indian filmmakers just did not realize how incredibly racist the whole segment is.  From a child that almost perfectly mimics ""Buckwheat"" from Our Gang, to exaggerated southern African-American dialect, it just left a huge bad taste in my mouth.  There are a hundred other ways they could have told the story without using racist stereotypes.  In this day and age, SOMEONE should have alerted the filmmakers during production how WRONG that whole sub-plot was, and how distasteful it would be to American audiences.

I was expecting a lot, as the trailer made it seem inspirational, and recommendations from friends only enforced that expectation. I have to say that not only were my expectations met, but they were surpassed. It is a truly beautiful film in every possible way. The story it has to tell, the way it is shot, the actors and their characters, the overall feel of the film is just absolutely stunning. I was taken on a rollercoaster ride of emotion as one moment I would be laughing my head off, and the next I'd be literally in tears. This film is not just here to entertain and make money (although I'm hoping it does a lot of both), but it sends out a very important and poignant message about the image of Islam in the world since the shocking and terrible events of 9/11. Not just Islam, but it sends out a message about all religion with the use of a very simple statement; ""Good people who do good deeds. Bad People who do bad. There is no other difference"". Such a strong message to send and it says something so simple. We're all human and regardless of the religion we live by or the culture we have, our deeds are what make us good or bad people and not those labels applied by those other parts of our lives.

The story follows the journey of Rizwan Khan (Shah Rukh Khan), a Muslim man with Asperger's Syndrome as he writes a letter to his wife Mandira (Kajol) while he is on a journey to give the President of the United States a message; ""My Name Is Khan, and I am not a Terrorist"". Through this letter he is writing, we come to learn about the emotions he truly feels and can't express when speaking due to his condition. We learn about his upbringing with his brother Zakir and his Mother in Mumbai, his arrival in America to work with his brother and his eventual falling in love with the woman who would be his wife, Mandira. Rizwan achieves the impossible. He has made a happy life for himself in America and kept a promise he made to his Ammi. This happiness is not to last, however, as the tragedy of 9/11 occurs turning Riwan and Mandira's life upside down in very frightening and tragic ways. The stereotyping of the Muslim terrorist begins to make its mark on the couple and put a strain on their relationship but, one day things hit rock bottom and their son, Sameer (Yuvaan Makaar) is killed in a racially motivated attack. This is the final straw and the relationship breaks apart and Rizwan is told to leave and in the heat of the moment, only to return when he has given the message to the US President.

Out of my little description, I've missed out so much. There's a lot to take in from this film and something that you will enjoy as the film runs. Shah Rukh Khan deserves a very prestigious western award for his role in this film. Possibly even going as high up as an Oscar (although I'm sure there's some rule that would prevent that from ever happening) as his performance is magnificent and he is truly deserving of wider recognition in the western world. He steals the show as the personality and mannerisms of the character are maintained beautifully throughout, from the twitching of the neck to simply the way he speaks. There are times when his traits are hilarious, and others when they are frankly annoying. But you never lose sight of the genuine and caring nature of this character and you become adoring of his flaws as they simply vale what is a very sweet personality.

This, in a sense, gives you more of a respectful understanding of the condition and how difficult it may be to cope with, especially in social circumstances, when you want to say something, but simply cannot express it the way you want. The message of everyone being simply being defined as being part of one of two groups, good or bad people, is one that I truly admire and taking on the topic of religion during such a raw and emotional time, and offering it from the perspective of an Asian family is a very brave and meaningful move.

4132916,5,B003K02EV0,"I also agree with the comments above.
It is a fantastic film, fun and serious at the same time.
It also holds an important message that is so easily forgotten in the turbulent world of today:
""There are only two kinds of people in this world - People who do good and people who do bad.""",1269907200,6,286,4.125

8398623,5,B003K02EV0,"Where to I begin? Khan is a fellow from India living in America (played by Bollywood Superstar Shah Rukh Khan). He shows classic mannerisms of Asberger's Syndrome (SRK gets it right...), but is high functioning and living with his brother and family -- has a job and falls for a lady. That's where things begin....

And for a while things go OK. He adapts and begins to learn his world.... Then something happens on a sunny day in September 2001 and Mr. Khan who is a devout Muslim.... Well, you can fill in the blanks....

No spoilers here, but suffice to say things don't go well. As a Muslim he prays wherever he's at 5 times a day.... And not everybody finds this comforting....

Trouble ensues and Khan decides (after things have gone REALLY wrong) that he needs to talk to the American President: he wants to tell him: ""My name is Khan and I'm not a terrorist...""

Sounds pretty simple. Right?

Wrong....

This is one of my favorite movies (I suppose I should add I'm not from India and I'm not a Muslim, not that it matters...). There's not much Bollywood singing and dancing (some..., enough), but, boy, does SRK nail this! Keep in mind that SKR is a Superstar in India and is a Muslim (who is definitely NOT a terrorist!). I can only believe that he must have really wanted to tell this story.

And the ending -- after so much goes wrong -- really works... but, Spoilers, Sweetie (see Dr. Who if this reference is too obscure...).

Bottom Line: Get it. Watch it.",1523145600,,1471,4.48314606741573
8398624,5,B003K02EV0,"A beautiful message and beautifully protrayed.  We must carefully use our words and actions so that no one is harmed or placed in a vulnerable position based on religion or, as the film has shown, being someone with Aspergers syndrome.",1522540800,,235,4.875
