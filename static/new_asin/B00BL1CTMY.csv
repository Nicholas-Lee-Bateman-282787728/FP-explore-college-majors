8570098,5,B00BL1CTMY,Great DVD for learning kung fu.  This is an advanced DVD so I would suggest getting the others first.  The DVDs provide hours of instruction for the martial art enthusiast.,1387497600,2,172,4.7

The filming is against a plain drape and a wooden floor, making it very easy to see details. There are no distractions in the background. Nicholas C. Yang has grown into his own and presents a very clear, crisp figure to follow along with.

I own most of the previous series of DVD's put out by YMAA and this one, like the others, is worth it's weight in gold. These treasures of old forms and teachings should be preserved for generations to come. I am lucky enough to train daily with a Shaolin Kungfu Xinyi Dao Grandmaster near my home. The teachings in this DVD set follow the same direction as our training. Respect for training partner, concentration on helping others, attention to basics and foundation, explanation of minute detail.

You can get a feel for the history of the art from Dr. Yang's introduction in the beginning of the DVD. He talks about Germans bringing beer to China, old masters falling ill from alcohol, the adaptation of forms to the large bodies, vast open fields and use of horses in Northern China. He smiles gently at one point trying to explain the subtle difference between types of jin. He finally gives up and says, ""you have to be Chinese"". You don't have to be Chinese to benefit from this wonderful series of instruction. I am a senior female, coming from a tai chi background and I love the drills in this set of disks. Foot work, angles, hand work, partner sparring, single practice and importantly, free form work is all shown clearly and precisely.

If you want to learn Si Lu Cha Quan and Si LLu Ben Za study with qualified teacher and buy this set of DVD's to enhance and speed up your skills.",1364256000,2,1736,4.57556270096463
8570100,5,B00BL1CTMY,"In July 2007 I collected my First YMAA DVD 'Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu Basic Sequences'. This is my Twenty Third YMAA DVD and I have to say that to buy a DVD like this one more than Five and a half years later and comparing it to previous DVDs that have been published just shows how much better the authors, producers and performers get at producing such high quality training material. As with all the sequences Dr Yang gives a brief history of the two presented in this DVD, as well as all the usual sections such as fundamentals, training routines, the sequences themselves and martial applications. An important thing to note about the 'Si Lu Ben Za' sequence featured in this DVD, is that it is the only barehand sequence in Long Fist that contains an External Sweep/External Crescent kick. It is nice to know that I can finally learn a sequence that contains this kick. This DVD also features other YMAA students/instructors, such as James Yang and Victor Marques, who have not appeared in other YMAA productions before. Seeing these two perform Long Fist and comparing them to all the other performers really gives you an opportunity to see where mistakes lie and determine what works best for you. If you include the weapons sequences taught in the 'Shaolin Saber Basic Sequences' and 'Northern Shaolin Sword Sequences' DVDs, then this one and all the other Long Fist sequences DVDs allows you to learn up to Sixteen sequences of Northern Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu. The only Long Fist barehand sequence taught in the YMAA curriculum that has not been published to date is 'Beng Bu' and if this doesn't happen then I will say that this DVD has been an excellent piece of work to mark the final installment in YMAA's Long Fist series!",1364083200,4,1740,4.671009771986971
