8620033,4,B00G18JUO2,"Set in Copenhagen this is a film about the Nordvest part of the city, which is a notorious centre for crime, drugs and ne'er do wells. Casper is a product of his environment and scratches a living doing break ins and selling onto a fence called Jamal. He lives with his lone parent mum, young sister and slightly younger brother Andy - they are brothers in real life.

Then he meets Bjrn, who is in a different league and decides to take Casper under his wing. He gets involved with prostitution, drugs and all the other paraphernalia that seems to be de rigueur for gangster types. Jamal though is not happy and seeks to teach the young pup a lesson. What starts off as macho bravado soon turns much darker very quickly with unforeseen consequences for all. None of that is a plot spoiler as its all in the blurb.

This is another great Nordic film that is original, in forms of script, and is made to extremely high standards. The acting is all excellent and from a virtually unknown cast - and that adds to the gritty realism. There is violence and other `adult' scenes but none is gratuitous. It is actually about the interplay and the relationships that control what people do in extreme situations. From director Michael Noer who also brought us the brilliant `R - Hit First Hit Hardest' - which is also well worth checking out. This is one that all fans of the new Nordic cinema will appreciate seeing - recommended.",1410566400,,1423,4.533073929961089
