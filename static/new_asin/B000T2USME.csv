8207640,5,B000T2USME,"Region 2 disks from the UK are now available for three previously unreleased specials.  These three specials were released on two separate disks.  The first of these disks is named simply ""Christmas Specials.""  The two previously unavailable episodes included on the ""Christmas Specials"" disk (pictured in the customer image from Le  Vieux) are as follows:

Black Canary (1998) One hour and thirty minutes.  A famous female illusionist known as the Black Canary has been living in quiet retirement at her country estate.  Her death, witnessed by her husband, is a puzzle that challenges even Jonathan's powers of observation.  Caroline Quentin, as Maddy, provides her usual blend of assistance and irritation.  Jonathan is also joined by a new character, Inspector Gideon Pryke played by Rik Mayall.  Not the usual dense and disdainful policeman, Inspector Pryke not only appreciates Jonathan's contribution to the case, but remains a step ahead in arriving at a solution to the engima.

Satan's Chimney (2001) Two hours.  When an actress is murdered on the set of her latest movie, Jonathan is asked to explain how the killer fired a gun through a plate-glass window without breaking the window.  Julia Sawalha replaces Caroline Quentin as Jonathan's cohort.  Reporter Maddy is gone, replaced by show business agent Carla Borrego.

The second of these disks (SOLD SEPARATELY) is named ""The Grinning Man"" (also pictured in a customer image from Le  Vieux).  It includes the two-hour episode of the same name and some limited extras.  Sheridan Smith takes over the role most recently inhabited by Julia Sawalha.  Miss Smith plays Joey Ross, a sassy and fearlessly sceptical paranormal investigator who shares Jonathan's interest in a series of baffling disappearances from a supposedly haunted room at the top of a large gothic house.

These episodes have not been released in the United States in Region 1 NTSC format. YOU MUST HAVE A REGION 2 OR REGION-FREE DVD PLAYER CAPABLE OF CONVERTING PAL SIGNAL TO NTSC TO PLAY THE DVD'S SOLD HERE.",1261699200,4,2039,5.139817629179332
