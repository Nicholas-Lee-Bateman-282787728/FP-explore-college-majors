2906318,4,B000TK0A56,A classic of British comedy.  No dialogue but this makes it all the more enjoyable.,1219190400,,83,4.533333333333333
2906319,5,B000TK0A56,"This has to be one of the best comedies ever filmed.  It contains a large list of British comedy actors who appear throughout the movie in cameo parts.  The humour comes not from bad language but from pure acting, as no words are used in any scene.
One has to understand British humour to really appreciate this movie.",1118188800,,318,4.4655172413793105

8209941,5,B000TK0A56,"The Vintage Plank
Eric Sykes and the crew, superb as usual with such simple props and story. It is old but still as funny as when it was first made.",1381622400,,148,3.966666666666667
8209942,4,B000TK0A56,"The new production has several changes from the original, still very funny, but the added voices are no benefit, the scene where the policeman is dumped in the pond has been omitted unfortunately. Likewise the gag when the coat is hung on a smooth wall , quite funny but been eliminated. Those who have never seen the original found it very funny, those of us who remember the original are a obit let down.",1358553600,,406,4.5
8209943,3,B000TK0A56,"It looks home made.  i could have made one myself on my computer and printed a cover, but it will do for what I want.",1357171200,,117,3.68
8209944,4,B000TK0A56,"You'd need to be a Brit or understand Goons-type British humour to get this. If, like me, you do get it, it's funny. If you don't it's silent, mysterious slapstick. You'll love it or hate it.",1354665600,,191,4.333333333333333

8209946,3,B000TK0A56,Unfortunately I didn't think of DVD Zoning as this doesn't work in Australia. There was no mention (that I can remember) of coding in the advertisement. :(  All other elements of purchase were fine,1310169600,,197,4.794117647058823
8209947,5,B000TK0A56,"For anyone who loves good old fashion slapstick comedy, this dvd is for you. Must have a dvd player that will play the PAL format. A real shame this was not converted to NTSC.",1252713600,,175,4.176470588235294
8209948,3,B000TK0A56,"Just a word of caution- this is the 1967 version.
Its good, but the 1979 version has a different cast with all the great actors, and is much better, but seemingly unavailable.",1244678400,2,175,4.5
8209949,2,B000TK0A56,"The plank is a collectors movie.  Of the two versions made, a black and white version and colour, I prefer the colour version, primarily because of the cast, which includes many of the British comedy actors of that era.  Humour changes like fashion and some of the over-acting that was fashionable in Britain during the sixties and seventies has lost some of its verve.  If you can get past that then the movie is classic slap stick and under statement.",1242950400,,453,4.6375
