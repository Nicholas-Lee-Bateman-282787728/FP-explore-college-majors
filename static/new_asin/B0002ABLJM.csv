This DVD is a little more intense, but you can also follow a lower impact routine while working up to the 2 1/2 mile walk/jog. I was not disappointed, have enjoyed all her walks and would recommend them to anyone!!!",1156032000,2,297,4.518518518518518
8025177,5,B0002ABLJM,"This is a great video! It really gets your heart pumping and if you don't want to jog, you can march in place. The workout goes by fast and before you know it your doing your cool down. I like Leslie a lot and hope to own all her tapes some day. She is so easy to follow, nothing fancy or hard but very good workouts.",1089590400,6,317,3.8181818181818183
