8461987,5,B0058O9SO2,"Pros:

This series is marvelous, so funny you will split your sides laughing. Absolutely brilliant comedy, which has a list of guest stars that is quite impressive. Very difficult to find in the US, and so all one can buy are region 2 DVD's such as this one. This ships from the UK, so allow extra time for it to arrive.

Cons:

Region 2, so if you don't a multi region player or a computer with a player you won't be able to view it. (There are however software players for Windows based PC's that will play any region, so just do a web search for them).",1484265600,,555,4.168224299065421
8461988,5,B0058O9SO2,"I discovered this show on Hulu. My first thought... ""What the hell did I just see?"" After two episodes, I was hooked. Could not wait to own the series for myself. I had to buy a region-free DVD player especially for this show and it was well worth the price & effort. Jinsy praise him!",1483228800,,285,4.2
