I only wish that sometimes he had explained things a bit more, but it made us go and do more research so it ended up OK! These are definitely Christian just so you are aware of that. I like that the ""teacher' always gives glory to God.",1398124800,4,363,4.2
8562506,3,B00B4UQUCC,The video is described as geared toward 5-11 y/o. My 9 and 11 y/o left almost immediately. They generally like science videos but didn't appreciate this one. I personally disliked the video because it was primitive and overly emotionally charged. The demonstrator seems to be the only person excited about the whole thing. Definitely for little kids (5-6).,1388102400,,356,5.155172413793103
