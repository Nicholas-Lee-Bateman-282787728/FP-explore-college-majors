8089456,5,B000BNMX1U,"Get it for what it is, a pretty funny dvd outlining tournament fighting from the time Eddie is a blue belt to brown belt. Its this simple, if anybody else tried to show you their jiu jitsu fights from blue to brown belt, you might stand watching a couple & be bored to death after. Eddie pulls it off however by being funny & he keeps you watching. Also, you see his moves, like ""old school sweep"", in action and see it truly does work over & over again in real competition. So it makes you really want to learn his moves.",1403136000,,522,4.127450980392157
8089457,3,B000BNMX1U,"After buying and LOVING Eddie's ""Master the Rubber Guard"" I'd thought that ""The Twister"" DVD would be very similar. Well... it's not. The Twister dvd show's about 10 of Eddie's matches leading up to and including some of his ADCC matches. It also show's some other ""filler"" material that seems a bit ""out of place.""",1322611200,,315,4.745454545454545
8089458,4,B000BNMX1U,"it's a documentary of Eddie's earlier tournies. in between matches he does a mock MTV cribs thing that's kinda funny. I enjoyed it, but don't rewatch it much.",1264809600,4,158,4.678571428571429
8089459,5,B000BNMX1U,"Twister itself is a great DVD, and was everything I expected, if not more. What I expected was a series of Eddie Bravo's matches with his commentary. I really (really!) prefer this format for watching matches than, say, a plain Mundial or ADCC video. I first encountered it on Michael Jen's Dynamic BJJ: Inside the Game DVD and it just makes the matches so much more interesting, educational, and watchable it's a crying shame more people haven't made releases in this format.

Eddie is a gifted speaker. Clear, relevant, and outrageously funny. (""No Shpine Lock!"" ""I either pulled half-guard or just shot the double and slammed him, can't remember..."") He explains what he's doing during the match and, more importantly, what he's thinking and why he's doing it. Obviously, the eponimus Twister plays a big part, as do the 'old school', 'lockdown', and other uniquely Bravo moves.

From his blue belt, through purple and brown belt matches, to Royler in ADCC (afterwhich I believe he was awarded his black), a good sampling of matches are offered. Most of the matches show an almost identical (consistent) gameplan, how he executes it, and (also very importantly) how he gets back to it, or switches to a back up, when things don't go as planned. (The secret of his success right there.) Yes, apparently, if you're super dedicated, have very good mind-set, are flexible, and (for Royler) become montrously strong for your weight, you can be a world champ with a small set of specialized gameplans, and just one side. :)

As a bonus, Bravo intersperses comedy sketches like a take off of MTV cribs, his demands for a PrideFC contract (starts with $1M and veiled 'work'), etc.

Easter eggs include instructional segments where he teaches a calf-crush from the lockdown called 'Kamakaze', and the overhook triangle he tapped Royler with (and although the fact that he tapped Royler is mentioned once and a while on the DVD, it is not, as perhaps it could have been, replacing the 10th Planet logo on his T-Shirt). Other easter eggs include comedy skits ranging from his Man Show submission to an imitation of a Brazilian BJJ teacher teaching... er... other forms of ground activity instead of grappling. Funny stuff.

Only downside is that easter eggs, while fun, can be annoying to get to for repeat viewing, and some may be turned off by seeing very similar matches time after time (though they should probably know better).

All in all, excellent DVD, one of the few that will probably be appreciated by a wider audience than just BJJ zealots.
