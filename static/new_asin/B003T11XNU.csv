8404908,3,B003T11XNU,"On the 10th day of Christmas 2014 I'm going to review...ROH Eliminating the Competition. The Papadon vs. Bobby Fish match was serviceable at best but it had real feeling to it. The Kenny King & Rhett Titus vs. Erick Stevens & Bobby Dempsey tag team match was not great but pretty good. The Brent Albright vs. Claudio Castagnoli match was a good back-and-forth exchange even with the finish. The Chris Hero & Eddie Edwards vs. Kevin Steen & Jay Briscoe tag team match was good but the conflict between Steen & Briscoe was the real focus of the bout. The Bryan Danielson vs. Delirious was good too but it served mainly to fuel the Jacobs/Delirious split, told a good story. The Austin Aries vs. Sami Callihan match was solid at best. The Street Fight: Necro Butcher vs. Brodie Lee was a smash-mouth hardcore brawl with a good chair shot finish to boot. The ROH World Title, 4-Way Elimination: Nigel McGuinness vs. Jerry Lynn vs. Tyler Black vs. Jimmy Jacobs while not bad, it was disappointing for an ROH main event. I give this event a 5 out of 10.",1419292800,,1047,4.544973544973545
