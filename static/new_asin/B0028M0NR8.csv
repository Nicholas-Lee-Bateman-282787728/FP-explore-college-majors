8356363,5,B0028M0NR8,"I  really enjoy Cecchine's instruction. His style is very unique. The techniques covered in Vol. #3, Handfighting and Takedown Defenses are solid. It would serve well as a stand-alone training guide for catch wrestling or as a supplement to another martial art. Highly recommended.",1308441600,,281,5.386363636363637
