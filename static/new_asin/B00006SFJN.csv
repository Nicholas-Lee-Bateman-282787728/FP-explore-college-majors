8595729,5,B00006SFJN,"I am as big a fan of the envelope pushing indie's as anyone, but there are all too often a lack of storytelling and talent trying to be different for the sake of being different.  They lack the magic you love about WELL MADE Hollywood films.  ""Gambling Divinity"" effectively gives you the daring plot and all around ""ride"" that makes a good film experience just that while leaving you with laughter and heart.  It also proves that there can be a solid level of special effects from a low budget indie.  It shows sure handed direction and a solid lead performance by Scott Tuton.",1035849600,,578,4.528846153846154
