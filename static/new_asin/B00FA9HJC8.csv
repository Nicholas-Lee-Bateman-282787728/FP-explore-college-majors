For example- there is a section on Space & Staging-explaining ""spacial relationship"":
""(using your Stage space) ...for composition, be aware of all quadrants & levels. Look for overall balance & flow.""

-How I am to be aware of the quadrants & levels? They never explain what the quadrants & levels of the stage are.

This DVD is set up in Chapters. Chapters go over various concepts/ideas that will help you to understand & create your own dance choreography for a troupe. Each concept is covered briefly, then they teach a choreography (or show a brief demo) that illustrates the concept. They give you lots of ideas on how to create your own dance.

This format worked well with some concepts but not enough time to completely cover others (IMOP).
For the ""Concepts & Ideas"" chapter, it was fine. The concepts were easy to understand and straighforward. For example: Mirroring- (I know that that is)- and then they showed a nice example of that. But in others- like the Dynamics & Structure chapters, the material here is really interesting & is most helpful to anyone performing. They briefly brushed over each concept & would move onto the next. I was a little disappointed by that. I found myself wishing I could raise my hand and ask a question. It would have been nice if they had spent more time  developing these concepts.

The bonus section has two nice exercises that I thought were very helpful & creative.
An exercise for ""energetic awareness."" It is intended to build unity & synchronicity to your troupe's performance by learning to connect with one another while dancing. And another exercise for music listening- a meditation to help you get in touch for inspiration to create your choreography.

The chapters on this DVD include:
Introduction
Space & Staging
Structure
Dynamics
Concepts and Ideas
Bonus Content
Extended Practice-all the combos
Extended Demo- all the troupe demos

Overall, there is alot of good material on this DVD.Anyone who would like to understand how to choroegraph a dance (especially a troupe) would benefit from the information here. I would definitely recommend this one.",1384905600,5,2243,4.981283422459893
8613717,5,B00FA9HJC8,"This is a great value; tons of information packed into this DVD. Anyone who creates choreography and stage dynamics for troupes will find this useful. There are combos, formation ideas, themes, stage spacing concepts, etc to work from or that may inspire you to create something else. Valuable to have in your library. If you get stuck with choreographer's block, just pop this DVD in.",1384473600,3,385,4.938461538461539
