5904391,5,B00EDJVQ66,"For King and Country know how to bring it live!!! I have been a fan of Joel and Luke and their band since first seeing them open WinterJam. This new live album of their hits captures the energy and excitement of their electrifying live performances. Their lyrics, always inspiring, have new power when experienced live. If you are already a fan you will want to add this to your playlist. If you are not a fan you will be after listening to the live version of their signature song ""Proof of Your Love"". It is exhilarating.",1383436800,4,523,4.458333333333333
